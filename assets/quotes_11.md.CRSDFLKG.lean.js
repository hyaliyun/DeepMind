Question: Question: what is the song heart shaped box about I found the following answer on Google: The international release of the single reached number five on the UK Singles Chart . Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"No, the answer you found on Google does not provide information about what the song \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" is about. It only states the international release's performance on the UK Singles Chart.  \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" is a song by the American rock band Nirvana, written by the band's frontman, Kurt Cobain. It was released as the first single from their third and final studio album, \\"In Utero,\\" in 1993.  While the exact meaning of the song is open to interpretation, several explanations and themes have been suggested. One common interpretation is that it is a song about love and relationships, particularly Cobain's relationship with his then-wife, Courtney Love. Some of the lyrics, such as \\"She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak\\" and \\"I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black,\\" may represent the character's vulnerability and desire to heal their partner's emotional pain.  Another theory is that the song confronts the concept of fame and the effect it had on Kurt Cobain and the rest of the band members. The lyrics \\"I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks\\" could be seen as a metaphor for being trapped inside the overwhelming expectations and pressures associated with fame.  The song's music video, directed by Anton Corbijn, has also fueled various interpretations of the song's meaning. The video features surreal imagery, such as fetuses hanging from trees, while Cobain, bassist Krist Novoselic, and drummer Dave Grohl perform the song in a field. There's also a man in a Santa Claus hat, an old woman in a wheelchair, and crow imagery, which could suggest themes of birth, death, and rebirth.  In summary, while \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" is open to various interpretations, the answer you found on Google focuses on the song's chart performance rather than exploring its themes and meaning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: An American Haunting Movie plot: This synopsis is from the UNRATED VERSION.A girl (Jane Powell) (Isabelle Almgren-Doré) is running through snowy woods near her house in Boston, Massachusetts. Something unseen is chasing her. She approaches the house and tries to open a double door. It opens and she rushes in, closing it and an inner door which she latches shut. She looks around, picking up a letter opener and leaves the room. The door is forced open by the unseen force. She runs upstairs into her bedroom, bolting the door. The doorknob is rattled as the unseen tries to get in. The noise stops and there is silence. The girl cautiously approaches the door when suddenly the ghostly image of a girl (Betsy Bell) (Rachel Hurd-Wood) appears beside her. She screams and at that moment awakens from a dream, sitting up in bed in hysterics. She is comforted by her mother (Elizabeth Powell) (Susan Almgren) who tells her she had a bad dream again. She suggests a nice warm bath, which is rejected by Jane, saying maybe later. The mother tells her she must get ready to be picked up by her father (David Powell) (Howard Rosenstein) for the weekend. She acknowledges this. Elizabeth picks up some clothes from the floor, noticing a bundle of old things which she asks Jane about.

To do this, we will follow simple steps based on the information given in the problem. Here's a breakdown of the problem and guidelines on how to use the given information: 1. The hostel had provisions for 250 men for 48 days. 2. We need to find out how long the food will last if 50 men leave the hostel. 3. To find the answer, first, we need to determine the total amounts of provisions the hostel had initially. We can do that by multiplying the number of men (250) by the number of days (48): 250 men × 48 days = 12,000 man-days. 4. Next, we will determine the number of men remaining in the hostel. Since 50 men left the hostel, there are now 250 men – 50 men = 200 men. 5. Now, we need to find out how many days the provisions will last for these 200 men. To do this, we will divide the total man-days (12,000) by the number of remaining men (200): 12,000 man-days ÷ 200 men = 60 days. So, the food will last for 60 days after 50 men leave the hostel.

In their little quaint village, they had a beautiful pond that was home to hundreds of tadpoles. Every summer, Craig would head over to the pond at the crack of dawn, excitedly carrying a clear jar and a net with him to catch some of the tiny creatures. Step 1: Establishing the characters' contrasting interests By emphasizing Craig's love for tadpoles and Samuel's disinterest, this step allows the reader to understand the primary difference between the two characters and how their interests may affect their interactions and choices in the story. Step 2: Introducing the setting Describing the village and the pond provides the reader with a visual image of the story's environment and the significance of the pond in the characters' lives. As Craig went through this routine each morning, Samuel would often accompany him, not because he shared Craig's enthusiasm for tadpoles, but simply because he cherished spending time with his best friend. Despite his lack of interest in the aquatic creatures, Samuel found joy in observing Craig's infectious passion for them. He would often sit under a nearby tree, watching as Craig meticulously examined each tadpole, classifying them by their size, color, and stage of development. Step 3: Developing the characters' friendship By showcasing Samuel's support for Craig even though he doesn't share the same fascination, this step helps to deepen the characters' friendship and provides insight into their bond over shared experiences. One day, as Craig carefully scooped a jar full of tadpoles, he discovered a tiny, glistening egg nestled among the plants at the bottom of the pond. Craig was thrilled at the prospect of witnessing the miraculous birth of a tadpole and eagerly showed Samuel his treasure. Step 4: Introducing a new element into the story Adding the discovery of the egg creates a plot point that can further develop the story and potentially create a shared experience or challenge for the two characters. Samuel's curiosity was piqued by the egg's mysterious nature, and despite his general aversion to tadpoles, he found himself surprisingly invested in the outcome. Craig and Samuel decided to protect the egg and monitor its development, each day watching with anticipation as it began to change. Step 5: Creating a shared experience for the characters Samuel's newfound interest in the egg creates a common goal for the two friends and allows the reader to explore how their shared experience can further develop their friendship and bond. As the days passed, the egg grew larger, and the friends would speculate about what kind of creature it would become. Samuel found himself opening up to the idea that maybe, just maybe, he might grow to love tadpoles as much as Craig did. Together, they patiently awaited the day when the egg would finally hatch and reveal a new tadpole to the world, uniting them in shared wonder and excitement for the cycle of life. Step 6: Finalizing the story's development The shared experience of caring for the egg leads to Samuel's growth as a character and demonstrates how the friendship between the two has evolved. Their bond strengthens, and the story concludes with a sense of unity and anticipation for the future."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

He also plays for Meridian in the Southern Veterans League. And the retired shipping manager says he doesn't feel out of his depth on the pitch, despite his advancing years.

Experts Say Obama Must Build a Bipartisan Machine to Move Education Law President-elect Barack Obama has made big promises to educators, parents and the nation's nearly 50 million public school students. He vowed to recruit an \\"army of new teachers,\\" create better tests and give public schools more funding. He also said he would make college more affordable. As the new administration prepares to take over the Education Department, school experts say one of Obama's first -- and toughest -- jobs must be restoring the broad bipartisan support it took to pass the 2002 No Child Left Behind Act, which aims to boost the achievement of poor children. That consensus has splintered, with people on both sides of the aisle souring on the law as it is overdue for reauthorization in Congress. \\"Forget the details of No Child Left Behind. The big challenge there is having to rebuild that bipartisan coalition,\\" said Gary Huggins, director of the Commission on No Child Left Behind, an independent effort of the Aspen Institute. \\"On the Democratic side you have people walking away from it because of union pushback. On the GOP side you have people walking away because this is too large a federal footprint.\\" Helping ensure college access is likely to be the next president's most pressing education priority. The financial downturn has raised concerns about the continuing availability of student loans. On Thursday, the Education Department announced plans to expand purchases of the loans it backs, the most recent of several steps to help avert a student loan crisis. \\"The most immediate issue is just the question of stability within the student loan programs,\\" said Alexa Marrero, spokeswoman for Rep. Howard P. \\"Buck\\" McKeon (Calif.), ranking Republican on the House Education and Labor Committee. \\"If we realize there's a problem, it will be too late.\\" But it is Obama's vision of refining the federal role in America's classrooms that may be the biggest political and policy challenge. He inherits an agency -- and a law -- that is seen by some local schools and union leaders as focusing more on sanctions and policing than on helping build better schools. The Education Department, created in 1980, has a 68.6 billion annual budget and plays a relatively minor role in financing for the nation's public schools. Much of its kindergarten-through-12th-grade spending focuses on helping students from poor families. But No Child Left Behind, enacted under President Bush, ushered in unprecedented federal influence in classrooms with a massive expansion of testing. With the aim of having all children proficient in reading and math by 2014, schools must meet steadily rising test score goals or risk sanctions as severe as a forced management shakeup. Federal education officials have supported states in creating tests and improving instruction, but the Bush administration also has clashed with local school leaders over testing requirements, even threatening to withhold federal dollars. Education Secretary Margaret Spellings is known for experimenting with ways to make the law more flexible for schools and states but also for protecting what she calls the law's \\"bright line\\" testing and accountability regimen. Previous secretaries, including William Bennett in the Reagan administration, Lamar Alexander in the George H.W. Bush presidency and Richard W. Riley in the Clinton administration, have used the office as a platform to push for one brand of school reform or another. Various names have been floated as possible successors to Spellings, but no clear front-runner has emerged. On Thursday, Anne L. Bryant, executive director of the National School Boards Association, called on the incoming administration to \\"facilitate, not dictate.\\" Efforts in Congress to reauthorize No Child Left Behind stalled as lawmakers awaited a new president. On his campaign Web site, Obama promised to \\"improve NCLB's accountability system so that we are supporting schools that need improvement, rather than punishing them.\\" And he said he would support merit pay programs designed in concert with teachers. Education experts say the next president will have to put a leader at the helm of the department who can reinvigorate support for the federal role in reforming public education. People in both major parties have railed against, and rallied for, No Child Left Behind. In a letter this month to the Wall Street Journal, Rep. Peter Hoekstra (R-Mich.) called No Child Left Behind \\"the most massive shift from personal freedom to government intervention.\\" Hoekstra wrote: \\"Once you've sold out parents and children, voting for massive spending increases to fund NCLB, selling out freedom in other areas became very easy, almost necessary.\\" The Democratic-supporting teachers unions aren't happy either. The National Education Association has called the law \\"prescriptive and punitive.\\" But an unusual coalition of business and civil rights leaders, including the Business Roundtable, the NAACP and the National Council of La Raza, supports the law. They worry that too many revisions will weaken the government resolve to force schools to help disadvantaged students. \\"The big challenge for President-elect Obama is he's going to have to appease the reformers, but also the teacher's unions, and that's going to be a delicate dance,\\" said Michael J. Petrilli, who was associate assistant deputy secretary in the Education Department from 2001 to 2005 and now works at the Thomas B. Fordham Foundation, an education think tank. \\"They are all going to be watching for signs that he's with them.\\" Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"President-elect Barack Obama faces the challenge of rebuilding bipartisan support for the 2002 No Child Left Behind Act, which aims to boost the achievement of underprivileged children while addressing issues related to college affordability and the federal role in public education reform.

The Yarnell Hill blaze killed 19 firefighters Sunday. Four C-130s are bound for Arizona firefighting efforts. The planes can drop massive amounts of water or fire retardant. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: \\"Firefighting Efforts Escalate in Arizona as Unpredictable Wind Conditions Loom\\" Unpredictable wind gusts have been a persistent challenge for firefighting efforts in Arizona as forecasters suggest that 80-mph gusts, while unlikely, are possible. The alert adds a new level of complexity to the looming challenges as firefighting personnel battle the blaze that has already had devastating consequences. This past Sunday, the firefighting community was hit hard by the Yarnell Hill fire, which resulted in the tragic loss of 19 brave firefighters. Their untimely deaths signify the potential dangers that these servicemen and women confront in their line of duty.  In light of these events, and the potential for erratic winds, national resources are being mobilized to aid in the ongoing firefighting efforts. Four C-130 aircraft have been dispatched to the ravaged region. Known for their high capacity and unerring capabilities, these planes are anticipated to significantly bolster the area's firefighting power. The C-130s, crucial for their capacity to drop massive amounts of water or fire retardant, will contribute greatly to efforts at curbing the fire's continued spread. The advantage they offer is two-fold. Not only can large volumes of water suffocate the fires, but the fire retardant will also help to create preventive barriers, hindering further proliferation of the blaze. As the situation continues to unfold, the unexpected may yet occur. Despite the forecaster's predictions that extreme 80-mph wind gusts are \\"unlikely\\", the potential remains. This possibility underlines the unpredictable, volatile nature of wildfires and the extent of the challenge faced by those bravely coming face-to-face with the flames. Through such Herculean efforts, these brave individuals are not only fighting the existing flames but also working tirelessly to prevent further loss and devastation. It is their resilience and relentless efforts that offer a ray of hope amidst the trying circumstances. The sacrifices made, lives lost, and collective efforts underline the severe magnitude of the Arizona wildfires and the fight that continues against them.  As the firefighting efforts continue, the nation watches, hopeful for the successful containment of the blaze, honoring the memory of those fallen, and paying tribute to the relentless endeavors of those at the frontlines. My steps in writing the article were first to compose a compelling title pertaining to the given highlights. Then, I provided background information on the current situation, translating the key points into elaborate details in the article. I then used the information about the C-130s to discuss the response to the fire, illustrating the benefits of these planes. Finally, I tied the conclusion back to the state's situation, giving respect to the firefighters who lost their lives and acknowledging the ongoing, tireless efforts of those still battling the flames."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I remember back in the late 1970’s when I first started investing in property as a young guy, being taken to a house that felt EXTREMELY cold, strange, and rather chilling. Okay it was an older house that need some renovation work, but there was something about the place that just did not seem right. But despite that, it was available for purchase at what seemed to be a very attractive price … always a good starting point. Anyway, the real estate agent finished taking me around the property answering the questions that I had, and I left with a plan to do some costings before making a decision. But something was niggling me and making me feel a little uncomfortable, so I decided to investigate the property further. A couple of days later I was around at a friends house. He was in the Police force and as it happened he was in the same neighbourhood, I mentioned this particular property that I was looking at buying. He asked me the actual address after which he ‘kindly’ informed me that that that house had been the scene of a murder 6 months previously. It turned out that the property had been rented to a homosexual couple and that after an argument, one had murdered the other in the bath and then proceeded to cut his head off. Apparently the head was subsequently discovered a week later in the trunk of a car that had been abandoned up by a local golf-course. Less than impressed that the real estate agent had been less than forthcoming with me, I made the decision to not to proceed with the purchase. As they say in the property business ‘Location, Location, Location’ is always an important factor in determining the value of a property. However despite that being a good location, it was reputation that deterred me on that occasion. Sometimes there are situations where even the best makeover will not work.

Here's an analysis of the key factors contributing to this rating: 1. Enthusiasm: The reviewer's choice of words, including \\"best\\" and \\"ever\\", indicates a high level of enthusiasm about the tool. This suggests that they had a positive experience and are impressed by its capabilities. Additionally, using an exclamation mark at the end of the statement expresses their excitement, further emphasizing their satisfaction. 2. Focus on the tool's capabilities: The review specifically mentions \\"Android and Linux integration\\" as the key feature, highlighting the tool's efficiency and usefulness in this domain. This speaks to the tool's ability to cater to the needs of those using both Android and Linux-based systems. 3. Brevity: While a brief review may sometimes lack sufficient detail to allow for a comprehensive understanding of the product, its brevity can also work in its favor. A concise, positive statement like this may resonate with potential users, piquing their interest and encouraging them to explore the tool further. However, it may not provide readers with enough context or information to fully grasp the reasons behind the reviewer's satisfaction. 4. Lack of specific details: The rating loses a point because the review does not provide any specific examples or details about what the user liked or what particularly impressed them. Details such as ease of use, compatibility, unique features, and support could have made their recommendation more credible and informative. In conclusion, I would give the review a 4 out of 5. It effectively communicates the author's enthusiasm and satisfaction with the tool's Android and Linux integration capabilities.

Elgar is probably best known for the first of the five Pomp and Circumstance Marches, which were composed between 1901 and 1930. It is familiar to millions of television viewers all over the world every year who watch the Last Night of the Proms, where it is traditionally performed. When the theme of the slower middle section (technically called the \\"trio\\") of the first march came into his head, he told his friend Dora Penny, \\"I've got a tune that will knock 'em – will knock 'em flat\\". When the first march was played in 1901 at a London Promenade Concert, it was conducted by Henry J. Wood, who later wrote that the audience \\"rose and yelled ... the one and only time in the history of the Promenade concerts that an orchestral item was accorded a double encore.\\" To mark the coronation of Edward VII, Elgar was commissioned to set A. C. Benson's Coronation Ode for a gala concert at the Royal Opera House in June 1901. The approval of the king was confirmed, and Elgar began work. The contralto Clara Butt had persuaded him that the trio of the first Pomp and Circumstance march could have words fitted to it, and Elgar invited Benson to do so. Elgar incorporated the new vocal version into the Ode. The publishers of the score recognised the potential of the vocal piece, \\"Land of Hope and Glory\\", and asked Benson and Elgar to make a further revision for publication as a separate song. It was immensely popular and is now considered an unofficial British national anthem. In the United States, the trio, known simply as \\"Pomp and Circumstance\\" or \\"The Graduation March\\", has been adopted since 1905 for virtually all high school and university graduations.In March 1904 a three-day festival of Elgar's works was presented at Covent Garden, an honour never before given to any English composer.

John was mad because he waited so long for the cab and had to run after the train. The  OPTIONS: A. cab arrived early.; B. train arrived early.;","output":"B. train arrived early.  Justification: I chose option B rather than A because the text tells us that John had to run after the train. This implies that the train arrived early, not on time or late. If the cab had arrived early, as per option A, John would likely not have any problem catching the train. Therefore, option B aligns better with the provided context, and makes the storyline logically consistent. John's anger, stated at the beginning of the text, is better justified if the train arrived early, contributing to the stressful situation. My next line would be, \\"John was mad because he waited so long for the cab and had to run after the train. The train arrived early, exacerbating his already frazzled nerves.\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

His descendants lived in the house until it was donated to the Aurora Historical Society in 1936. It now operates as a Victorian-period historic house museum. Options:  (1). Yes;  (2).

The Second World War ended in 1945. The William Tanner House was built in 1857.  To find out how many years the house had been standing by the time the war ended, we can subtract the year it was built from the year the war ended: 1945 (end of the war) - 1857 (year house was built) = 88 years So, the William A.

Question: Who is the agent in charge of Bang-hee's case? Movie title: Shiri Movie plot: An elite group of North Korean soldiers are put through a brutal training regime. Under the auspices of their commander, Park Mu-young (Choi Min-sik), they will be sent into South Korea as sleeper agents, to be reactivated at some later date. The most promising of the group is Lee Bang-hee, a female sniper who systematically kills several key South Korean government figures over the next few years.Meanwhile, South Korea is searching for Bang-hee. The agent in charge of her case, Yu Jong-won (Han Suk-kyu) has nightmares about her murdering both him and his partner, Lee Jang-gil (Song Kang-ho). Yu is also currently engaged to a young woman, Yi Myung-hyun (Kim Yoon-jin), a former alcoholic and the owner of a fish and aquarium supply store. They are happy together, but Yu is worried that he cannot tell Myung-hyun about the real nature of his job due to his security clearance.Yu and Lee are contacted by an arms dealer who claims to have information about their quarry, but he is shot dead by Bang-hee before he can give them any information. After digging a bit deeper, they determine that he had been contacted by the assassin at some point, in the effort to acquire something. That something turns out to be CTX, a binary liquid explosive developed by the South Korean government. In its ground state, CTX is indistinguishable from water, but when placed under the right temperature conditions for long enough, a single liter of it can explode with enough force to level a fifteen-story building. The agents begin to suspect its intended use by the assassins, when Kim, a scientist working at a lab connected to CTX, is assassinated by Bang-hee.Park and his agents ambush a military convoy with several liters of CTX, killing all the soldiers and making off with the dangerous liquid before the agents could arrive in time to warn them. Later, Park calls Yu and issues an ultimatum: he has concealed several CTX bombs around Seoul, and will give him just enough time to find each one before setting them off. It is revealed that Park...

Process:  - The diaphragm contracts - The lungs expand - Air is pulled from outside the body, into the lungs - The membranes in the lungs collect oxygen molecules - Oxygen is transferred to red blood cells - Red blood cells distribute oxygen throughout the body -   suppose there is no oxygen to breath in happens, how will it affect LESS oxygen reaching the body.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer to this question is:","output":"Directly impacting a step of the process. When there is no oxygen to breathe in, it directly impacts the process of respiration. Specifically, it affects the following steps: 1. Air is pulled from outside the body, into the lungs - Since there is no oxygen in the air being inhaled, the lungs will not receive the necessary amount of oxygen. 2. The membranes in the lungs collect oxygen molecules - Due to the lack of oxygen in the inhaled air, there won't be enough molecules for the membranes in the lungs to collect and transfer. 3. Oxygen is transferred to red blood cells - With less oxygen available, only a limited amount will be transferred to the red blood cells. 4. Red blood cells distribute oxygen throughout the body - As there is less oxygen in the red blood cells, the amount of oxygen being distributed throughout the body will be significantly reduced. This perturbation of the process as a result of having no oxygen to breathe in would have a direct impact on the process, leading to reduced oxygen supply to the body's tissues and organs, which could cause severe health issues or even be life-threatening."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I use too much curry powder for the meal ..  (2). The curry gets burned by having it on high heat for too long.  (3). None of the above choices ..  (4). I use a lot of spices and aromatic herbs .. Answer the following question: What may happen during the time that i cook ?","output":"During the time that you cook, various outcomes may occur depending on the choices you make and the techniques you employ. Here is a detailed explanation of each option and the potential consequences on the aroma, taste, and overall quality of the curried chicken dish: (1). If you use too much curry powder for the meal: Adding an excessive amount of curry powder may result in an overpowering flavor and aroma. The balance between spices, heat, and savory and sweet elements may be disrupted, leading to a dish that lacks the desired harmony of flavors. Additionally, using too much curry powder can contribute to an increased risk of burning or sticking to the bottom of the pan due to its ground spices. Mixing the curry powder with oil or tomato-based sauces can reduce the likelihood of sticking and enhance the flavors of the dish. (2). If the curry gets burned by having it on high heat for too long: Cooking the curry on high heat for an extended period may result in the dish developing an unpleasant, bitter taste due to burned spices. The high heat may also cause the chicken to become overcooked, losing essential moisture and becoming less tender in the process. Moreover, the burned aroma could permeate the rest of the dish and even the surrounding environment. To prevent this outcome, opt for cooking the curry on medium or low heat for an extended time, which allows the spices to meld, the chicken to cook evenly, and the flavors to develop without the risk of burning. (3). If none of the above choices occurs: Assuming you have measured and added the correct amount of curry powder, ginger, salt, sugar, and flour, and have cooked the dish under an optimal temperature and duration, the desired outcome is a curried chicken with a beautifully balanced aromatic, savory, and spicy flavor profile. The dish would exude a pleasant aroma and satisfy your taste buds, making it a culinary success. (4). If you use a lot of spices and aromatic herbs: Incorporating a variety of spices and aromatic herbs not only enhances the flavors of the dish but also helps build layers of taste and aroma, contributing to a more complex and intricate dish. Utilizing a diverse range of spices, such as cumin, coriander, paprika, and cinnamon, or adding aromatic herbs like cilantro or basil, can elevate the curried chicken beyond a standard rendition and provide a unique and memorable eating experience. However, it is essential to balance these bold flavors with care, ensuring that no particular herb or spice becomes too overpowering. In conclusion, the successful outcome of your curried chicken will depend on proper measurements of ingredients, careful heat management while cooking, and a balanced blend of spices and herbs. These factors will contribute to a dish with a fabulous aroma and taste, maintaining the harmonious combination of flavors that curried chicken is known for."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

M: The prevailing attitude about premarital contracting is that it spoils the whole concept of marriage, love, and trust. How do you counter that?  F: First of all, most of us hear about premarital contracting when someone rich and famous gets divorced and about all the battles they are going through. I know when my husband and I decided that we wanted to have a premarital contract, my son said \\"Why you guys doing that? Don't you trust each other?\\" So it's not surprising that people's initial reaction is a negative one. But in fact, premarital contracting is a way that we can learn more about each other, make each other feel more comfortable about issues that are of concerns, and certainly clarify money concerns. This way, we can talk about them, decide together how we want our marriage to work, and if necessary, and only if necessary, we put it in a premarital contract, a legal document.

Let me break down how I reached this conclusion for a better understanding: 1. First, I understood the definition of cognition: Cognition refers to the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses. 2. Second, applying this definition to the question, cognition about one's own cognitive processes meant a self-awareness of how one's mental processes or thinking patterns function. 3. In psychology, there's a specific term for this kind of self-scrutiny of one's own mental processes: Metacognition. 4. The understanding of one's own cognitions or thought processes is a core aspect of Metacognition. This includes being aware when you’re processing information, understanding the notion of thinking processes, and learning strategies. 5.

Regrettably, my most recent visit to [Place] delivered a less than satisfactory experience, leaving me somewhat frustrated and ultimately disappointed. Upon arrival, I was met with a lackluster presentation - the scenery was unimpressively mundane and not what was expected, considering the embellished descriptions and gleaming reviews circulated online. The environment did not exude the touted ambiance of relaxation and excitement it had promised. Instead, it was overwhelmingly strewn with litter – a complete eyesore that ironically stole the attention from what the place was originally known for. Service, which should have been the saving grace in light of the troubling environmental disarray, unfortunately, was as underwhelming. The staff were seemingly uninterested in their roles, ignoring customers instead of welcoming them as expected in such a setting. Information provided was often scarce and offered with an air of indisputable indifference. There was an overall lack of the welcoming charm we travelers both need and appreciate - mainly because traveling to a new place can be daunting. In terms of amenities, the place was drastically lacking. Restroom facilities were in an appalling state – unclean, under-supplied, and unattended for what seemed like a considerable length of time. Dining options were limited and the food was mediocre at best, not offering equal value for the price points. Product quality and variety should be compulsory within such spaces because they directly impact the customer's experience. Accessibility was another annoying issue. Getting around was unnecessarily arduous since the place was scarcely signposted. As a result, navigation turned into unexpected, avoidable chore. An efficient mapping system or clear directional indicators would vastly improve the situation. Even given the leniency of appreciation for various environments, the safety measures in and around the place were questionable. Protective guidelines were not clearly stated, and measures to ensure individual safety were strikingly absent. Proactively ensuring the safety of tourists and guests should be a top concern for any reputable establishment. In conclusion, my journey to [Place] was not an agreeable encounter. It was marred by poor service, wretched amenities, lack of cleanliness, difficulty in navigation, and questionable safety provisions. Until significant improvements are made, I am inclined to advise potential visitors to consider alternative places where the value, enjoyment, and safety are more guaranteed. Though this review is negative, it comes from a place of hoping to see [Place] rise to the standards it has the potential to reach but hasn't yet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: SEOUL — In addition to growing concerns that North Korea will pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S., prospects for improved inter-Korean relations have also stalled, as Pyongyang demands that U.S.-South Korea joint military drills be scaled back, and a group of defectors be returned. Just weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in declared the beginning of a new era of peace during a historic summit held in the demilitarized zone of the inter-Korean border, Pyongyang has put further dialogue and cooperation on hold until its demands are met. President Moon will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the upcoming Trump-Kim summit and the North’s sudden conditions set for continued dialogue and cooperation. Most of North Korea’s anger last week, expressed in official statements and reports carried by the state news agency KCNA, seemed to be directed at the U.S. It criticized the Max Thunder joint military exercise that is currently underway, and U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton’s demands for the North’s unilateral nuclear disarmament. North Korea in particular objected to Bolton’s insistence that North Korea follow the Libyan model, which involved the rapid and total dismantlement of that country’s nuclear program, but it was also followed by the overthrow of the country’s leader Moammar Gadhafi some years later. Unless the U.S. eased up on its uncompromising stance, Pyongyang indicated it would pull out of the June 12 meeting in Singapore between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump to negotiate an end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. President Trump later said the Libya model does not apply to North Korea and that Kim Jong Un would remain in power and “be very rich” if he makes a deal to end his country’s nuclear program. North Korea denounced South Korea, as well, for the joint military drills, calling the Seoul government...

Review: DEATHSTALKER is perfect for B-fantasy movie fans; this barely 80-minute travesty of film-making features everything hecklers can ask for--non-existent plotting, terrible acting (save for at least a raspy-sounding old lady), laughable scripting and schlock editing, and bargain-basement style background settings. There are no characters that come across as likable or interesting (in particular, the lead doesn't have ANYTHING appealing about him), and the actors assembled barely do anything to rise above the F-grade material. If that's not enough, then how about the lack of a compelling plot (which this movie has nothing of the sort) to make DEATHSTALKER qualify as a major turkey? I was also offended that the women in this movie barely serve any purpose other than to 1) be topless and/or scantily clad; 2) get raped; 3) have sex with the hero; 4) all of the above. In addition, the background music is hideous; a bizarre mess of electronic noise, cheesy choral bursts, and blaring orchestral cacophony. Ear numbing and eye numbing all in one packed with nary a thing to keep one interested, DEATHSTALKER is probably best suited for folks looking for something to laugh at (and believe me, there's plenty of that in here).

Wishing well: Wishing wells are typically considered a non-productive way to spend money, as they are based on superstition. However, it's an occasional activity, so it's possible that his parents consider it harmless fun. 2. Piggy bank: Saving money in a piggy bank is generally a responsible way to manage finances, so this option seems less likely because the prompt mentions that James's parents felt he was wasting his money. 3. Eat cake: This option doesn't make much sense, as it doesn't specify putting a coin anywhere or have a clear relationship to wasting money. 4. Change purse: A change purse is for storing coins and small amounts of cash. This option does not indicate that James is wasting his money, so it is less likely to be the correct answer. 5. Parking meter: Putting coins in a parking meter is a necessary expense if someone needs to park their car. While this may seem like a waste of money in some situations, it doesn't align with the idea of James's parents allowing him to put a coin there every weekend in a lackadaisical manner.

Jehovah's Witnesses teach that only they meet scriptural requirements for surviving Armageddon, but that God is the final judge. During Christ's millennial reign, most people who died prior to Armageddon will be resurrected with the prospect of living forever; they will be taught the proper way to worship God to prepare them for their final test at the end of the millennium.\\",  answer the following question.

Q: In this task, you will be shown an English sentence. You need to classify the sentence as either a representation of an anaphor number agreement or as an incorrect representation. An anaphor is an expression whose interpretation depends upon another expression. Anaphor number agreement is a restriction where a phrase agrees with the preceeding expression: plurals match plurals or singular expressions match singular expressions. In this task a valid representation of anaphor number agreement should be denoted as 'good' while everything else should be denoted as 'bad'. A correct representation of an anaphor number agreement will be a grammatically correct instance of a sentence where the subject and self-referencing nouns match plurality. An incorrect representation is a sentence in which the subject and self-referencing noun's plurality do not match. Guys hadn't sounded like herself. A:","output":"I used the definition of anaphor number agreement to determine whether the sentence is a correct representation or not. In the given sentence, the subject 'guys' is plural, but the self-referencing pronoun 'herself' is singular. Since the plural expression does not match the singular expression, the sentence does not follow anaphor number agreement and is classified as 'bad'."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When it comes to skateboarding, Elena is much better compared to Betty due to  OPTIONS:  (A). Elena being lazy.;  (B). Betty being lazy.;","output":"When it comes to skateboarding, Elena is much better compared to Betty due to  OPTIONS:   (A). Elena being lazy.;   (B). Betty being lazy. To continue writing the text, we must first choose between the provided options. In this case, we will choose option B: \\"Betty being lazy.\\" When it comes to skateboarding, Elena is much better compared to Betty due to Betty being lazy. While both girls started learning how to skateboard at the same time, their progress has been significantly different. This can largely be attributed to their varying levels of dedication and effort they've put into honing their skills. Step 1: Identify the difference in dedication level. Elena has always been enthusiastic about skateboarding, spending hours every day practicing her tricks and improving her balance. She watches skateboard tutorials, takes notes, and eagerly experiments with new techniques. This dedication and passion for the sport is evident in her progress. Step 2: Explore Betty's lack of effort. On the other hand, Betty has yet to develop the same level of dedication. Instead of spending time practicing, she often chooses to do other activities or procrastinate. As a result, her progress has been much slower than Elena's. Step 3: Analyze the impact of laziness on skill development. Betty's laziness directly impacts her ability to become better at skateboarding. While she may possess the innate talent for it, her lack of practice and commitment holds her back from reaching her full potential. Step 4: Demonstrate the outcome of their efforts. With each passing day, the gap between Elena's and Betty's abilities widens. Elena continues to master new tricks and refine her skills, while Betty remains stagnant, unable to progress past basic maneuvers. Step 5: Conclude by reiterating the main point. In conclusion, Elena's impressive skateboarding skills can be attributed to her dedication and hard work, whereas Betty's slower progress is a direct result of her laziness. It goes to show that consistent effort and devotion are imperative to achieving success in any endeavor."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Review: Sports movies have never been my thing, but a small handful of them work for me. The best are the those which focus less on the sport and more on the character, such as Raging Bull, the Wrestler and Girlfight. This is a great directorial debut for Karyn Kusama, and an outstanding first performance for Michelle Rodriguez. Girlfight feels is both realistic and involving, that is enough so to make it a memorable film. The plot is strait forward enough. Diana Guzman, is in her fourth year of high school, but due to her picking fights in the hallway she is close to expulsion. As a possible means of unleashing her anger, she signs up for Boxing lessons at the club where her brother is training (at the wishes of there father). In the course of ninety minutes, we the viewers see something extraordinary. Diana almost literally changes from a girl to a woman. We see it in her body as well as her behaviour, especially when one of the boys at the club finds himself drawn to her, and she gets into it. There is not a bad scene or a lame/contrived moment in the film. The only error that I would say could be corrected is that one of the subplots ends on what feels like an unfinished note. Aside from that, Girlfight is a great movie. Now, what is this review like? Choose your answer from: + negative. + positive.","output":"This review is positive.

In both sentences, the founding of the technological center is described as a result of some form of working together among three entities. In the first sentence, it's identified as \\"cooperation,\\" while in the second, it's referred to as \\"collaboration.\\" While the words differ, their meanings in this context are synonymous. Both words indicate that the three organizations worked jointly to achieve the founding of the technological center. 3. The three entities involved in the founding of the technological center are consistent between the two sentences, including: the Armenian Government, the Enterprise Incubator Foundation, and the World Bank. The order the entities are mentioned differs between the sentences, but that does not change their involvement in the collaboration or cooperation.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Ruby Rose Langenheim (born 20 March 1986), better known as Ruby Rose, is an Australian model, DJ, recording artist, actress, television presenter, and former MTV VJ. Rose emerged in the media spotlight as a presenter on MTV Australia, followed by several high-profile modelling gigs, notably as the face of Maybelline New York in Australia. In addition to her modelling career, she has co-hosted various television shows, namely Australia's Next Top Model and The Project on Network Ten. Rose pursued a career in acting from 2008 onwards, with her debut performance in the Australian film Suite for Fleur. In order to land her job as an MTV VJ in Australia, Rose competed against 2000 other hopefuls in a three-week national search, as former VJ Lyndsey Rodrigues moved to the United States to co-host TRL. As part of the competition, she downed 100 shots of beer in 100 minutes against Jackass's Bam Margera, and kissed strangers on a busy Sydney street. However, she enjoys her job as VJ compared to her previous job as a model. \\"Being a model there is always something they want to change. Whether they want someone a little bit skinnier, a little bit taller, a little bit prettier, but MTV wants you to be yourself ... not censoring anything and not conforming to anything\\".  In 2009, Rose won the ASTRA Award for Favourite Female Personality. She also travelled to Kenya to \\"highlight ... [the] amazing work\\" done by Global Vision International. She appeared in the episode \\"Media Virgins\\", of Australia's Next Top Model, acting as a guest judge, and also worked as a correspondent for the finale of Australia's Next Top Model.  In July 2009, Rose along with Dave Hughes, Charlie Pickering, Carrie Bickmore and James Mathison hosted The 7pm Project, an Australian television news talk show produced by Roving Enterprises which airs weeknights on Network Ten. She left the program to pursue her own hosting projects. In October 2009, it was announced that FOX8 had picked up the rights to UK format Ultimate School Musical, which features ordinary teenagers from a school attempting to put on a music production to a professional standard in just six weeks. The Australian version was produced by FremantleMedia Australia with Rose as host, and aired in 2010. Rose also hosted the Foxtel Mardi Gras for 3 consecutive years before becoming an official correspondent for Foxtel for the Vancouver Winter Olympics in 2010. In October 2015, Rose hosted the 2015 MTV Europe Music Awards alongside Ed Sheeran in Milan. Did she make any other television apperances?","output":"Yes, Ruby Rose made other television appearances.

Possible A: kitchen, supermarket, table, stomach, restaurant  Why is \\"kitchen\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Kitchen\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it is a space specifically designed and equipped for preparing and cooking food. When considering the task of making food, it is important to think about the necessary environment and tools for accomplishing this goal.  Step 1: Analyze the context of the question. The question asks about the best place for making food, implying a location where it is most efficient and appropriate to prepare meals. Step 2: Evaluate each possible answer in terms of their suitability for making food. - Supermarket: A place where groceries and ingredients are sold, but not typically where food is prepared. - Table: A surface for serving or eating food but not designed for cooking or preparation. - Stomach: An organ in the body for digesting food, not a place for preparing or making food. - Restaurant: A place where food is prepared, but this option is usually associated with professional chefs or cooks rather than a general place for individuals to make food. Step 3: Determine the most suitable answer. Out of all possible answers, \\"kitchen\\" is the most suitable because it is a space where individuals have access to appliances, utensils, and other necessary equipment for preparing and cooking food.

Here's a step-by-step solution: Step 1: Combine like terms on the left side of the equation. (498 - 304) * w = 304*w + 1430 194 * w = 304*w + 1430 Step 2: Now, to isolate w, we must eliminate the term involving w on the right side of the equation. To do this, let's subtract 304*w from both sides. 194 * w - 304 * w = 304*w - 304*w + 1430 -110 * w = 1430 Step 3: Now, to find the value of w, divide both sides by -110.

Given the below context:  Kozelsk and Starobelsk were used mainly for military officers, while Ostashkov was used mainly for Polish Scouting, gendarmes, police officers, and prison officers. Some prisoners were members of other groups of Polish intelligentsia, such as priests, landowners, and law personnel. The approximate distribution of men throughout the camps was as follows: Kozelsk, 5000; Ostashkov, 6570; and Starobelsk, 4000. They totalled 15,570 men.According to a report from 19 November 1939, the NKVD had about 40,000 Polish POWs: 8,000-8,500 officers and warrant officers, 6,000-6,500 officers of police, and 25,000 soldiers and non-commissioned officers who were still being held as POWs. In December, a wave of arrests resulted in the imprisonment of additional Polish officers. Ivan Serov reported to Lavrentiy Beria on 3 December that \\"in all, 1,057 former officers of the Polish Army had been arrested\\". The 25,000 soldiers and non-commissioned officers were assigned to forced labor (road construction, heavy metallurgy).Once at the camps, from October 1939 to February 1940, the Poles were subjected to lengthy interrogations and constant political agitation by NKVD officers, such as Vasily Zarubin. The prisoners assumed they would be released soon, but the interviews were in effect a selection process to determine who would live and who would die. According to NKVD reports, if a prisoner could not be induced to adopt a pro-Soviet attitude, he was declared a \\"hardened and uncompromising enemy of Soviet authority\\".On 5 March 1940, pursuant to a note to Joseph Stalin from Beria, six members of the Soviet Politburo — Stalin, Vyacheslav Molotov, Lazar Kaganovich, Kliment Voroshilov, Anastas Mikoyan, and Mikhail Kalinin — signed an order to execute 25,700 Polish \\"nationalists and counterrevolutionaries\\" kept at camps and prisons in occupied western Ukraine and Belarus.

Question: -  The particles remove small pieces of the rock each time they touch the rocks - The particles continue to hit, brush against, or grow against the rocks - The rock eventually is broken apart by this contact - The pieces of the rock are now small rocks - The rock pieces are worn away into smaller and smaller pieces by the same forces -   What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process, as described, involves the interaction of specific particles with rocks, ultimately leading to the gradual breakdown of the rock material. In the context of geological processes, these particles could be natural or environmental agents such as water, ice, wind, or even other rock materials. This step can be described in more detail as follows: 1. Initial contact: The process begins with the particles (such as sand, sediment, or even small fragments of other rocks) coming into contact with the rock surface. This contact can be facilitated by natural forces such as wind, water currents, glacial movement, or even tectonic activity. The particles' size, composition, and the strength of the forces acting upon them will play a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of the rock's erosion and breakdown. 2. Abrasion and weathering: As the particles make contact with the rock surface, they act as abrasive agents, gradually wearing away small pieces of the rock material each time they touch it. This process is known as physical, or mechanical, weathering. Over an extended period, the repeated contact between the particles and the rock causes the surface to weaken and become more susceptible to further erosion and breakdown. 3. Formation of cracks and fractures: The constant interaction between the particles and the rock can lead to the formation of small cracks and fractures within the rock structure. These defects make the rock more vulnerable to other weathering processes, such as chemical weathering or freeze-thaw cycles, which can further weaken the rock and cause it to break apart more easily. 4. Continued impact and erosion: The particles continue to impact the rock, either directly or indirectly through wind, water, or ice movement. As the cracks and fractures in the rock become more pronounced, the mechanical weathering process accelerates, leading to the eventual breakdown of the rock structure. In summary, the first step of the process involves the interaction between specific particles and rocks initiated by various natural forces. This contact initiates a chain of events that ultimately causes the breakdown of rock material into smaller fragments, which are then subjected to further erosion and weathering processes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Plot title: Saturn 3 Movie plot: In the distant future, an overcrowded Earth relies on research conducted by scientists in remote stations across the solar system. One of these, a small experimental hydroponics research station on Saturn's third moon, is run solely by Adam (Douglas) and his colleague and lover Alex (Fawcett). Adam, the younger Alex and their dog Sally enjoy their isolation, far from an overcrowded and troubled Earth. The couple have been on Saturn 3 for three years, but Alex has spent all her life in space. Alex and Adam's idyll is broken by the arrival of Captain Benson (Keitel), who has been sent to Saturn 3 as part of a project to replace at least one of the moon's scientists with a robot. Benson assembles the robot and names him Hector. One of the first of its kind, a \\"Demigod Series\\", Hector relies on \\"pure brain tissue\\" extracted from human fetuses and programmed using a direct link to Benson's brain. Benson states that it will render one of the crew \\"obsolete\\", most likely Major Adam who tells his partner that he is close to \\"abort time\\" according to the government on Earth. Unknown to both Alex and Adam, Benson is a homicidal sociopath who murdered the captain originally assigned to Saturn 3 and took his place on the mission. Benson had actually failed a crucial test of psychological stability. As Benson uses the link to his brain to program the robot, Hector acquires Benson's homicidal nature and his lust for Alex. Hector initially kills Sally the dog and then assaults Benson, having learned about Benson being a murderer during the reprogramming process. Adam and Alex manage to disable the robot while it is recharging. Believing the danger over, Adam accuses Benson of gross incompetence and orders him to dismantle the robot and return to Earth when an eclipse ends. Benson obliges, but Hector is soon reassembled by the base's older robots. Resuscitated, Hector murders Benson while he is dragging Alex to his ship. Hector then blows up Benson's spacecraft before Adam and Alex can escape in it, trapping them all on... My question: Where was Captain Benson sent?

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Information:  - A symphony is an extended musical composition in Western classical music, most often written by composers for orchestra. Although the term has had many meanings from its origins in the ancient Greek era, by the late 18th century the word had taken on the meaning common today: a work usually consisting of multiple distinct sections or movements, often four, with the first movement in sonata form. Symphonies are scored for string (violin, viola, cello and double bass), brass, woodwind, and percussion instruments which altogether number about 30100 musicians. Symphonies are notated in a musical score, which contains all the instrument parts. Orchestral musicians play from parts which contain just the notated music for their instrument. A small number of symphonies also contain vocal parts (e.g., Beethoven's Ninth Symphony).  - Sound recording and reproduction is an electrical, mechanical, electronic, or digital inscription and re-creation of sound waves, such as spoken voice, singing, instrumental music, or sound effects. The two main classes of sound recording technology are analog recording and digital recording.  - Chamber music is a form of classical music that is composed for a small group of instrumentstraditionally a group that could fit in a palace chamber or a large room. Most broadly, it includes any art music that is performed by a small number of performers, with one performer to a part (in contrast to orchestral music, in which each string part is played by a number of performers). However, by convention, it usually does not include solo instrument performances.  - (Franz) Joseph Haydn (31 March 173231 May 1809) was a prolific Austrian composer of the Classical period. He was instrumental in the development of chamber music such as the piano trio and his contributions to musical form have earned him the epithets \\"Father of the Symphony\\" and \\"Father of the String Quartet\\".  - A piano trio is a group of piano and two other instruments, usually a violin and a cello, or a piece of music written for such a group. It is one of the most common forms found in classical chamber music. The term can also refer to a group of musicians who regularly play this repertoire together; for a number of well-known piano trios, see below.  - A record label or record company is a brand or trademark associated with the marketing of music recordings and music videos. Often, a record label is also a publishing company that manages such brands and trademarks, coordinates the production, manufacture, distribution, marketing, promotion, and enforcement of copyright for sound recordings and music videos; conducts talent scouting and development of new artists (\\"artists and repertoire\\" or \\"A&R\\"); and maintains contracts with recording artists and their managers. The term \\"record label\\" derives from the circular label in the center of a vinyl record which prominently displays the manufacturer's name, along with other information.  - Edison Records was one of the earliest record labels which pioneered sound recording and reproduction and was an important player in the early recording industry.  - The term musical form (or musical architecture) refers to the overall structure or plan of a piece of music, and it describes the layout of a composition as divided into sections. In the tenth edition of \\"The Oxford Companion to Music\\", Percy Scholes defines musical form as \\"a series of strategies designed to find a successful mean between the opposite extremes of unrelieved repetition and unrelieved alteration.\\"  - The Haydn Quartet , later known as the Hayden Quartet , was one of the most popular recording close harmony quartets in the early twentieth century . It was originally formed in 1896 as the Edison Quartet to record for Edison Records ; it took its new name when recording for other companies . The name was a homage to Joseph Haydn , the classical composer ; the spelling was later revised to Hayden , which reflects the way it was pronounced . The group disbanded in 1914 .  - A composer (Latin \\"compn\\"; literally \\"one who puts together\\") is a person who creates or writes music, which can be vocal music (for a singer or choir), instrumental music (e.g., for solo piano, string quartet, wind quintet or orchestra) or music which combines both instruments and voices (e.g., opera or art song, which is a singer accompanied by a pianist). The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores).

Answer the following question: When asked to define ourselves we often use broad brushstrokes. Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses. When do people use broad brushstrokes according to the author?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The great man was moving with what seemed like great reluctance. He knew as he climbed from the car in Upper Manhattan that he was stepping into the maelstrom, that there were powerful people who would not react kindly to what he had to say.      “I come to this magnificent house of worship tonight,” said the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., “because my conscience leaves me no other choice.”      This was on the evening of April 4, 1967, almost exactly 43 years ago. Dr. King told the more than 3,000 people who had crowded into Riverside Church that silence in the face of the horror that was taking place in Vietnam amounted to a “betrayal.”      He spoke of both the carnage in the war zone and the toll the war was taking here in the United States. The speech comes to mind now for two reasons: A Tavis Smiley documentary currently airing on PBS revisits the controversy set off by Dr. King’s indictment of “the madness of Vietnam.” And recent news reports show ever-increasing evidence that we have ensnared ourselves in a mad and tragic venture in Afghanistan.      Dr. King spoke of how, in Vietnam, the United States increased its commitment of troops “in support of governments which were singularly corrupt, inept, and without popular support.”      It’s strange, indeed, to read those words more than four decades later as we are increasing our commitment of troops in Afghanistan to fight in support of Hamid Karzai, who remains in power after an election that the world knows was riddled with fraud and whose government is one of the most corrupt and inept on the planet.      If Mr. Karzai is at all grateful for this support, he has a very peculiar way of showing it. He has ignored pleas from President Obama and others to take meaningful steps to rein in the rampant corruption. His brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai, the kingpin in southern Afghanistan, is believed by top American officials to be engaged in all manner of nefarious activities, including money-laundering and involvement in the flourishing opium trade.      Hamid Karzai himself pulled off a calculated insult to the U.S. by inviting Iran’s Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to the presidential palace in Kabul, where Ahmadinejad promptly delivered a fiery anti-American speech. As Dexter Filkins and Mark Landler reported in The Times this week: “Even as Mr. Obama pours tens of thousands of additional American troops into the country to help defend Mr. Karzai’s government, Mr. Karzai now often voices the view that his interests and the United States’ no longer coincide.”      Is this what American service members are dying for in Afghanistan? Can you imagine giving up your life, or your child’s life, for that crowd?      In his speech, Dr. King spoke about the damage the Vietnam War was doing to America’s war on poverty, and the way it was undermining other important domestic initiatives. What he wanted from the U.S. was not warfare overseas but a renewed commitment to economic and social justice at home. As he put it: “A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.”      The speech set loose a hurricane of criticism. Even the N.A.A.C.P. complained that Dr. King should stick to what it perceived as his area of expertise, civil rights. The New York Times headlined its editorial on the speech, “Dr. King’s Error.”      Mr. Smiley, in his documentary, noted that “the already strained relationship between President Johnson and Dr. King became fractured beyond repair.” And donations to Dr. King’s Southern Christian Leadership Conference “began to dry up.”      So it took great courage for Dr. King to speak out as he did.      His bold stand seems all the more striking in today’s atmosphere, in which moral courage among the very prominent  the kind of courage that carries real risk  seems mostly to have disappeared.      More than 4,000 Americans have died in Iraq and more than 1,000 in Afghanistan, where the Obama administration has chosen to escalate rather than to begin a careful withdrawal. Those two wars, as the Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz and his colleague Linda Bilmes have told us, will ultimately cost us more than 3 trillion.      And yet the voices in search of peace, in search of an end to the “madness,” in search of the nation-building so desperately needed here in the United States, are feeble indeed.      Dr. King would be assassinated exactly one year (almost to the hour) after his great speech at Riverside Church. It’s the same terrible fate that awaits some of the American forces, most of them very young, that we continue to send into the quagmire in Afghanistan. ||||| Yesterday, as Alex Pareene noted , South Carolina Republican state Sen. Jake Knotts gave us an unusually frank rendition. Of his party’s front-running gubernatorial candidate, state Rep. Nikki Haley, Knotts said, \\"We already got one raghead in the White House. We don't need a raghead in the governor’s mansion.\\" Haley immigrated to the United States as a child from India. She is a convert to Methodism, from Sikhism.      You know the pattern. Since the 2008 campaign, every few weeks or months some minor political figure in the GOP utters something scandalously racist about the president. The Republican Party distances itself from the comments. Democrats mutter about how the conservative movement is riddled with troglodytes. Nobody gets anywhere.      Sikhs are, of course, not Muslims. Hailing from what is now the border area between Pakistan and India, Sikhism bears some similarities to Islam and Hinduism both, but is not a sect of either. To lump it in with Islam makes about as much sense as an insult as calling a Christian a kike. Same geographical origin, very rough theological similarities — close enough, right?      Anyway, despite the crude literalism of the slur — like many Muslims, orthodox Sikh men wear turbans — it's fairly clear from the thrust of the insult that Knotts thought he was just calling Haley a sand nigger. (Like the president!) So here we have our troglodyte.      Cue damage control. The state Republican chair, Karen Floyd, issued a statement condemning Knotts. And if it sounds a bit halfhearted, well, this is how these things always sound. \\"The South Carolina Republican Party strongly condemns any use of racial or religious slurs. Senator Knotts should apologize for his inappropriate comments, so that we can put this unfortunate incident behind us and focus on issues important to moving our state forward.\\"      Knotts, for his part, has offered up a halfhearted retraction. He was kidding around, he says. Except, also, not. \\"Since my intended humorous context was lost in translation, I apologize. I still believe Ms. Haley is pretending to be someone she is not, much as Obama did, but I apologize to both for an unintended slur.\\"      And now, here comes the charge of the left brigade, arguing that Knotts, not Floyd or Haley, represents the true soul of the GOP. That, I suppose, is me.      The rumors about Haley, just like the ones about Barack Obama, wouldn't be around if they weren't compelling to some people. Knotts, who is a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, seems to make some sense of the world around him by classifying Haley and Obama as foreigners, Middle Eastern category (roughly). But that doesn't really prove that racism is built into the right wing. All it shows is that the right wing includes racists within it.      On this topic, Salon's editor, Joan Walsh, recently wrote,      I'm coming to regret using the term \\"racist\\" about the Tea Party. \\"Racist\\" is a personal insult, and it's almost as impossible to prove it as to disprove it. It's not a terribly illuminating term, either: If you call me a racist, you haven't really described anything I've done that's objectionable. You've just somehow designated me, and my so-far unchallenged arguments, outside the pale, so to speak.      This is true, and it's an important point. And it gets us closer to how we have to understand racism on the right. As Joan suggests, it's not worthwhile to claim that hatred and prejudice lurk in the heart of every conservative. \\"Hatred\\" and \\"prejudice\\" aren't even really especially useful concepts. They make racism seem much more personal and individual than it really is. Because racism isn't a parasite or a virus or even a personality defect that we can detect if we just know how to read the signs. It doesn't so much live in people as it exists between them. Racism helps people accomplish something; that's why they buy into it. It's a characteristic of their relationships, not of their selves. It's negotiated and mutable, rather than fixed in the soul. And the mutation we're seeing is a relatively new one.      So if we're looking for racism on the right — if we're looking to explain Knotts — we need to look in the connective tissue of the conservative coalition, and ask, \\"What is racism doing here? What is it accomplishing for people?\\"      Knotts’ comment fits into a pattern of plainly racial solidarity underlying conservative nationalism and war-on-terror ideology. You can see this all over the place: in the insistence that Obama, our first nonwhite president, must somehow be an ally or even a member of the teeming Islamic hordes. There's the hysteria about the \\"Islamicization\\" of Europe, cast fairly plainly in racial terms. There’s the love affair between the right wing and Israel; pundits love to attribute this to Christian conservative millennialism, but that doesn't do nearly enough explanatory work. Not every conservative ultra-Zionist is also a fundamentalist Christian. It's something else: The Jews, at least, are cousins, but the Arabs are brown-skinned strangers.      Racism is, in this way, in the bones of the modern conservative movement. What we've seen in Knotts' comment is a little corner of an X-ray. Through the second half of the 20th century, anticommunism was what gave structure to otherwise disparate elements of conservatism — the libertarians, the social conservatives, the nationalist war hawks. The war on terror has had to tag in for the Cold War. Many of the trappings are the same: the paranoia about sleeper agents and Manchurian candidates within our own ranks certainly rings a bell. But the core of conservative animus and belligerence here is a belief in an irrevocable clash of civilizations that has been going on for centuries, and picks up on much of the legacy of Jim Crow-type racial conservatism.      Even within the mainstream right, it's pretty clear that Islam is widely written off as the collective ailment of a vast, unitary empire, whose people will never understand anything except force. Read the National Review or the Weekly Standard for a little while (or even the New Republic, if you know where to look), and this assumption comes across unmistakably. (While I was writing this post, an item went up at the National Review whose only clear point appears to be the suggestion that Muslims are just criminal by nature. This, only several hours after a post condemning Knotts.) This works well for the social conservatives, who think they are doing God’s work by fighting Islam; it works for the nationalist conservatives who think that the world is being divided up between America and the Muslims. (It doesn't seem to work as well for the libertarians, who’ve been getting off the bus a little bit lately.)      This isn't to say that Mark Steyn and Bill Kristol have Klan hoods in their closets. I'm sure they think of themselves as racial egalitarians and color-blind. (Well, I'm sure Kristol does, anyway.) Even Jake Knotts probably does. But they can’t defend the things that matter to them without racism. This is why well-meaning conservatives like Conor Friedersdorf get tripped up when they try to salvage the Tea Party from accusations of racism. Friedersdorf's argument was, essentially, it doesn't feel racist, it isn't supposed to be racist — so what do you want from them?      But this is the thing: There's nothing to be done. Racism lives among right-wingers, not inside them. It's the air they breathe. And without it, there wouldn't be a coherent American conservatism. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"The article talks about a speech by Martin Luther King Jr. against the Vietnam War and the negative effects it had on both the people in the war zone and the United States.

Given the below context:  In 1861, it was announced that a Provisional Theatre would be built in Prague, as a home for Czech opera. Smetana saw this as an opportunity to write and stage opera that would reflect Czech national character, similar to the portrayals of Russian life in Mikhail Glinka's operas. He hoped that he might be considered for the theatre's conductorship, but the post went to Jan Nepomuk Maýr, apparently because the conservative faction in charge of the project considered Smetana a \\"dangerous modernist\\", in thrall to avant garde composers such as Liszt and Wagner. Smetana then turned his attention to an opera competition, organised by Count Jan von Harrach, which offered prizes of 600 gulden each for the best comic and historical operas based on Czech culture. With no useful model on which to base his work—Czech opera as a genre scarcely existed—Smetana had to create his own style. He engaged Karel Sabina, his comrade from the 1848 barricades, as his librettist, and received Sabina's text in February 1862, a story of the 13th century invasion of Bohemia by Otto of Brandenburg. In April 1863 he submitted the score, under the title of The Brandenburgers in Bohemia. At this stage in his career, Smetana's command of the Czech language was poor. His generation of Czechs was educated in German, and he had difficulty expressing himself in what was supposedly his native tongue. To overcome these linguistic deficiencies he studied Czech grammar, and made a point of writing and speaking in Czech every day. He had become Chorus Master of the nationalistic Hlahol Choral Society soon after his return from Sweden, and as his fluency in the Czech language developed he composed patriotic choruses for the Society; The Three Riders and The Renegade were performed at concerts in early 1863. In March of that year Smetana was elected president of the music section of Umělecká Beseda, a society for Czech artists. By 1864 he was proficient enough in the Czech language to be appointed as music critic to the main Czech language newspaper...  Guess a valid title for it!

It also regularly entered the politics of the kingdoms on the Arabian Peninsula, and eventually extended its rule over the region with the conquest of the Himyarite Kingdom.

Firstly, the reviewer begins their review with a strong and emotionally charged statement: \\"I think I was just discriminated against!\\" This assertion immediately sets the tone for the entire review as negative because it suggests that the reviewer feels unfairly treated. Next, the reviewer points out that the pharmacy refused to fill their prescription citing an unacceptable reason, which contributes to the negative sentiment. The mention of having filled prescriptions there seven-plus times highlights the reviewer's disappointment and an expectation of receiving better service. Moreover, the reviewer expresses feelings of being undervalued and possibly lied to; this further cements the negative sentiment of the review. Using a phrase like, \\"I'm so shaken up,\\" intensifies the negative feelings conveyed, as it illustrates that the event left a lasting and unfortunate impression on the reviewer. Additionally, the reviewer strongly recommends taking business elsewhere, reinforcing the idea that other potential customers should avoid this pharmacy. This suggestion is undeniably negative, as it actively discourages new patrons and may potentially deter existing ones. Lastly, the reviewer is convinced that the pharmacy \\"violated my rights,\\" which is a grave accusation and further establishes the negative sentiment of the review.

Write an article using the following points: Typhoon Bopha has so far killed 647 people in the Philippines. A another 780 people are missing, including hundreds of fishermen. Relief agencies are trying to help the thousands of people left homeless by the storm. Article:","output":"Title: Typhoon Bopha: Grim Death Toll and a Humanitarian Crisis Unfolding in the Philippines Introduction: Typhoon Bopha, a category 5 storm that recently hit the Philippines, has left a trail of death, destruction, and a deepening humanitarian crisis in its wake. The destructive power of Bopha is only now becoming apparent, as local officials and humanitarian agencies try to assess the full extent of the carnage. Grim Death Toll and Missing Persons: Since Typhoon Bopha made landfall in the southern Philippines, the death toll continues to rise with at least 647 people confirmed dead, and there are concerns that this number may still increase. Another worrying development is the large number of still missing persons, with 780 unaccounted for, including hundreds of fishermen who were caught at sea when the storm hit. Homelessness and Humanitarian Response: In the hardest-hit areas, where the storm has left thousands of people homeless, the challenge now is to provide these storm victims with essential services such as food, drinking water, shelter, and clothing. The disaster has reached such a scale that it has even pushed the government and several humanitarian relief agencies to seek international assistance in a race against time to mitigate the immediate dangers these storm survivors face. Aid agencies, like the Philippine Red Cross, World Food Program, and UNICEF, have been actively involved in providing much-needed supplies and support for those affected by this catastrophe. The Philippine government, along with these aid organizations, have set up temporary accommodations, distributed relief goods, and provided medical assistance to the thousands in need. The Aftermath and Recovery: As Typhoon Bopha slowly loses power and dissipates, the ordeal for the people of the Philippines is far from over. The struggle now is to rebuild their lives and recover from the crippling damage left behind. Many homes, schools, and businesses were flattened, and with damaged infrastructure, travel and communication have become challenging, further complicating rescue and recovery efforts. Environmental Impact and Future Concerns: The environmental impacts of Typhoon Bopha are also severe. Soil erosion and landslides have become a major concern, particularly in the hardest-hit areas where vast swaths of agricultural land and forests were wiped out. This devastation can have significant long-term impacts on food security and livelihoods in the country. Typhoon Bopha follows a series of storms that have battered the Philippines in recent years. Climate change is often cited as a key factor leading to an increase in the frequency and intensity of major typhoons, making the Philippines more vulnerable to similar natural disasters in the future. Conclusion: The tragedy of Typhoon Bopha cannot be understated. The people of the Philippines are grappling with the dual challenges of mourning their lost loved ones and rebuilding their lives. Yet, the resilience and hope displayed by the Filipinos in these trying times undeniably serve as a beacon of inspiration to many. As the international community comes together to help the Philippines in its time of need, dialogue and action on climate change mitigation and disaster risk reduction must not be delayed. It is crucial to recognize the urgent need for long-term strategies and proactive measures to better prepare for and protect against the devastating impacts of severe weather events in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Yesterday, he was working on two samples, sample A and sample B. Sample A was a strong acid, and sample B was a weak acid. David needed to find the differences between them.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which would lose a proton more easily, sample A or sample B?  Hint: The strength of an acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose a proton. A strong acid is one that completely dissociates in water; in other words, one mole of a strong acid HA dissolves in water yielding one mole of H+ and one mole of the conjugate base, A−, and none of the protonated acid HA. In contrast, a weak acid only partially dissociates and at equilibrium both the acid and the conjugate base are in solution. Examples of strong acids are hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydroiodic acid (HI), hydrobromic acid (HBr), perchloric acid (HClO4), nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). In water each of these essentially ionizes 100%. The stronger an acid is, the more easily it loses a proton, H+. Two key factors that contribute to the ease of deprotonation are the polarity of the H—A bond and the size of atom A, which determines the strength of the H—A bond. Acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the conjugate base. Answer:","output":"Given the information provided, Sample A, which is a strong acid, would lose a proton more easily than Sample B, the weak acid. This is because the strength of an acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose a proton, and strong acids completely dissociate in water, yielding one mole of H+ and one mole of the conjugate base A-. In contrast, weak acids only partially dissociate and both the acid and its conjugate base are present in the solution at equilibrium. The ease of deprotonation is influenced by factors such as the polarity of the H-A bond and the size of atom A which determines the strength of the H-A bond.

Yes This question is asking whether we can conclude that \\"A man is rinsing machinery\\" based on the information that \\"A man is hosing off a piece of machinery.\\" In order to break down the statement and understand the underlying meaning, let's analyze the relevant words and phrases in both sentences. 1. \\"A man is hosing off\\" and \\"A man is rinsing\\": In both sentences, the subject and action remain the same - a man is doing something to a piece of machinery or machinery in general. The difference lies in the verbs: \\"hosing off\\" vs \\"rinsing.\\" The term \\"hosing off\\" implies that the man is using a hose to spray water on the machinery for cleaning it. \\"Rinsing\\" implies the use of water to cleanse or wash, but it is not specific about the source of water or the method of action. However, in the context of cleaning machinery, it can be reasonably inferred that both phrases convey similar actions where water is being used to clean the machinery. 2. \\"A piece of machinery\\" and \\"machinery\\": The main difference in these phrases is the specificity. \\"A piece of machinery\\" refers to a single, specific item or unit of machinery, whereas \\"machinery\\" can refer to one or multiple machines, or even machinery as a concept. Since we know that the man is working on a single piece of machinery, it is reasonably inferred that the single piece he is working on falls under the broader category of \\"machinery\\" in general. By analyzing and understanding the similarities and differences between the sentences, we can determine whether or not it's possible to conclude that \\"A man is rinsing machinery\\" based on the given information. In this case, the actions in both sentences (hosing off and rinsing) closely align in meaning, as both involve the use of water to clean machinery, and the specific piece of machinery in question is still a part of the broader concept of \\"machinery\\". Therefore, it is appropriate to conclude that \\"A man is rinsing machinery\\" based on the given information. So, the answer is A). Yes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:Warren Gatland is coaching the Lions with Rob Howley one of his assistants, so regular forwards coach Robin McBryde is in charge of Wales for the matches against Tonga in Auckland on 16 June and Samoa in Apia a week later. With 12 senior internationals, including captain Alun Wyn Jones on Lions duty, and a number of players such as experienced prop Gethin Jenkins forced to withdraw injured, McBryde has been forced to call upon less familiar faces. Media playback is not supported on this device The 46-year-old has 14 uncapped players in his 32-man squad, all aiming to make the grade at international level. Seven uncapped players were named in Wales' Six Nations squad - rewarded for promising domestic displays - but none of them were involved in any match-day 23. Just three players - Ellis Jenkins, Cory Hill and Sam Davies - have won first caps since the 2015 World Cup. Wales' coaches have received criticism for that, accused of relying on the same old faces and not giving new players chances to shine. The matches against Tonga and Samoa offer perfect opportunities for the likes of Ospreys wing Keelan Giles, Wasps flanker Thomas Young and Gloucester bound fly-half Owen Williams. Only three of the players who featured under McBryde four years ago when Wales headed to Japan for two Tests - Liam Williams, Dan Biggar and Scott Baldwin - were involved in the 2017 Six Nations. With preparations already well underway for the 2019 World Cup in Japan, the aim for Wales will be to head there with a squad of experienced international stars, rather than relying too much on a starting side that has brought success to Welsh rugby under Gatland. This tour, though, is without doubt a tough test for McBryde's inexperienced squad, with Welsh wins rare down under. Samoa are clearly capable of mixing it with the game's best, while Tonga have the potential to be much more than just a nuisance as they proved last year in beating Italy 19-17 in Padova. Tonga will not have 'home advantage' - as their Teufaiva Sport Stadium in Nuku'alofa is being redeveloped - they will undoubtedly have plenty of support in Auckland. Still, Wales have never lost to Tonga in seven previous meetings and it would be a shock were they to suffer a first defeat on Friday. A week later McBryde's squad visit Apia to take on Samoa, who have a history of inflicting humiliating defeats on Wales. Media playback is not supported on this device Samoa have won four of the nine matches between the two sides, including famous World Cup wins in 1991 and 1999 as well as a comfortable 34-9 victory at home in Apia the last time Wales toured the Pacific Islands in 1994. New Zealand were the last tier-one nation to visit and were pushed to the limit by a fired-up Samoa, before holding on for a 25-16 victory in 2015. It was ample proof that the small country deserves to be recognised as a force in the global game and worthy of more visits from the elite. It may sound like a nice way to end the season for Wales. History, though, suggests otherwise. Wales squad: Prop: Nicky Smith (Ospreys), Wyn Jones (Scarlets), Gareth Thomas (Ospreys), Tomas Francis (Exeter Chiefs), Rhodri Jones (Ospreys), Dillon Lewis (Cardiff Blues).

Jobs Data Show Steady Gains, but Stagnant Wages Temper Optimism Only days after many voters complained of worsening economic prospects, the new employment report from the government on Friday provided fresh evidence that the economy was actually getting better, with a sizable jump in the number of people saying they found a job last month. The Labor Department estimated that employers added 214,000 jobs in October, and the official unemployment rate dropped to 5.8 percent, down sharply from 7.2 percent a year ago. The increase in payrolls — combined with a revision that added 31,000 jobs to previous reports from August and September — put the average monthly job gain for the last six months at about 235,000. That pace, several analysts said, indicated that the economy was gathering momentum. But the report also found that wages were rising only slightly faster than the rate of inflation, fueling the debate over just how strong the labor market really is. Over the last 12 months, wages are up just 2 percent, which helps explain much of the disconnect between increasingly cheery assessments from many economists and the public’s continuing discontent. Speaking before a cabinet meeting, President Obama said that the economy had experienced the strongest job growth since the 1990s, and that the unemployment rate was at a six-year low. “We are adding jobs, but it is still a wageless recovery,” Elise Gould, an economist with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, said, adding that average hourly earnings rose only 0.1 percent in October after no gain in September. “The economy may be growing, but not enough for workers to feel the effects in their paychecks.” Many economists nonetheless found plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the future. The number of people walking away from the labor market has halted, while the average number of hours worked ticked up. And a survey of households, though generally considered less reliable than figures gathered from employers, found that more than 683,000 people had been hired into a new job last month. “Labor force participation actually rose” to 62.8 percent, said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at the Northern Trust Company, who noted that the drop in unemployment was not simply a result of people dropping out of the work force. A broader measure of unemployment that includes discouraged job seekers or those stuck with only part-time work dropped to 11.5 percent, down more than 2 percentage points from the seasonally adjusted figure from a year ago. The headway on jobs can be seen as validation of the Federal Reserve’s decision to end its bond-buying campaign last month, while the lack of wage growth is likely to add caution to the Fed’s considerations over when to raise interest rates next year. “I’m not thinking we’re behind the curve,” Loretta J. Mester, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, told CNBC on Friday, meaning that the latest jobs numbers had not convinced her that the Fed should move more quickly. October Jobs data show solid employment growth. Some analysts counseled patience on the wage front, predicting that the strengthening job market would soon translate into tangible increases. “We think this is a very strong report,” said Michael Gapen, an economist at Barclays. “We will see wage gains going forward. They just didn’t show up in this report.” Paul Ashworth, an economist at Capital Economics, said the Labor Department’s figures might not reveal all the progress that has been made. “The employment cost index is a much more comprehensive measure of wage growth, on which the Fed has traditionally put more weight,” he noted, concluding that “it shows a very clear acceleration in wage growth” over the last six months. Perhaps, but as Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez pointed out, what people care about is their weekly paycheck. “Wages are what matter to living standards,” he said. Mr. Perez noted that workers had benefited from few of the gains in productivity in recent decades. “Sweat equity isn’t translating into financial equity, even while the C.E.O.s of those companies are reaping dramatic rewards,” he said. “That’s the angst and frustration that I see across this country.” While the recovery from the recession is in its sixth year, stagnant wages and the wide gap between the rewards for those at the top of the income ladder and for ordinary workers have left many people disenchanted with their economic prospects. Election Day exit polls found that 78 percent of those surveyed were very or somewhat worried about the future of the economy, while two-thirds said they believed the economy was getting worse. The lack of wage growth, particularly at the bottom, helps explain why ballot measures aimed at increasing the minimum wage in Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska, Illinois and South Dakota all passed despite widespread losses in those states among Democrats who supported such measures. “It may seem counterintuitive that wages and salaries are growing the slowest in industries where jobs are growing the fastest,” LaVaughn M. Henry noted in an analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s Cincinnati Branch, “but it actually is not.” Because many of the new jobs in the leisure, hospitality and retail industries require little training or credentials, he explained, there is little pressure to raise wages. Low-paying leisure and hospitality jobs accounted for nearly one in eight new jobs created in the past year, economists at IHS Global Insight noted, while many of the newly reported hires were teenagers. There were also racial disparities in the job gains, with whites experiencing an unemployment rate of 4.8 percent compared with 10.9 percent for blacks and 6.8 percent for Hispanics. The persistent problem of long-term unemployment showed no signs of improvement this month, with 2.9 million people out of work for 27 weeks or more. This group accounts for about a third of those without jobs. Even the gloomiest assessments, however, acknowledged that no matter how tepid one might think the recovery is, the United States is still far outpacing Europe. Six years after a debt crisis hit the continent, unemployment in the European Union has edged down only slightly to 11.5 percent from a peak of 12 percent last year. It is nowhere near returning to precrisis levels of around 7 percent. There are other signs of the American economy’s strength. Over the last 12 months, according to a report released on Wednesday, the number of bankruptcy cases filed in federal courts dropped 13 percent to 963,739, the lowest since the 2007 fiscal year. And consumers, encouraged by falling gasoline prices, are more upbeat about job prospects than at any time in the last six years. Many of the strongest jobs gains were in service industries, created by small-business employers like Matthew Saravay, who runs Wizard Studios, a special-event production company in Brooklyn. “We’ve never been busier,” Mr. Saravay said. “I have interviews lined up, trying to keep up with the clamor of opportunity. We’re seeing holiday parties return in a way I haven’t seen in seven or eight years.” Steve Roesner, president and chief operating officer of Quatro Composites in Iowa, which produces structures for manufacturers in the aerospace industry, said he hired 100 new workers this year, bringing the company’s total staff to 220. He expects to further increase his work force by 20 percent next year. “In our industry, there’s a lot of optimism,” Mr. Roesner said. Looking ahead, Tara M. Sinclair, an economist at Indeed.com, one of the nation’s largest sites for job postings, said she had noticed particularly strong growth in the retail and transportation sectors. “It definitely looks like things are slowly moving in the right direction,” she said.

I was a very confused 17 year old, and she took an interest in me, and we would talk about all my problems with my own family, and everything that was going wrong with me. I even ‘came out’ to her at one point. We spent a lot of time together and gradually, I thought I might not be gay after all, as I had feelings of love for her. Eventually, we started dating and I tried to suppress my gay feelings. Eventually, I proposed. We were engaged for just over a year and I got married at the age of 19. I have to admit, when the wedding plans got firmed up and much closer to the date, I started to feel that I was in fact still gay but so much money had already been spent, and plans made that I was too afraid to pull out. Don’t get me wrong, I still love my ex wife a heck of a lot, but as my very best friend. I hate to use the phrase, but with everything that has gone on with me the last few years, she has been ‘my rock’. We separated after about 8 years, when our daughter was 7 years old, and I told her why. I just couldn’t go on living the lie. I hate myself for doing it to her. Selfishly, I wouldn’t change things though, as I have my daughter and I love her, and I love being a parent. We had ‘Unexpected Song’ played as she walked down the aisle at the church; the lyrics really summed up how we felt about each other and how we had gotten together… Unexpected Song Michael Crawford YouTube. What did the author feel for his daughter? Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. not enough information  B. Disgust  C. Fear  D. Love The answer is:","output":"D. Love In the narrative, the author mentions his feelings for his daughter explicitly when he says, \\"Selfishly, I wouldn’t change things though, as I have my daughter and I love her, and I love being a parent.\\" This statement indicates he cherishes his daughter and loves being a parent, which directly relates to the option D. Love. His feelings for his daughter are filled with affection and love, and he expresses no sentiments of disgust or fear toward her, ruling out options B. Disgust and C. Fear. Furthermore, the information on his feelings for his daughter is explicitly stated, which rules out the option A. not enough information.   Thus, based on the text, the author's feelings for his daughter are full of love, and he highly values the fact that he is a parent, inspite of the complex and challenging journey he has faced with his sexuality and personal relationships. Through the trials of his personal journey he has maintained a strong bond and love for his daughter, showing the significance of this relationship in his life. He used the word \\"love\\" to describe his emotions towards his daughter, which suggests this is an enduring and strong feeling. Therefore, it's clear that love is the dominant and prevailing feelings the author holds for his daughter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Q:Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Which restaurant focuses more on just pizza, Valentino's and Imo's Pizza? A:","output":"Step 1: Gather information about each restaurant To determine which restaurant focuses more on just pizza, I will start by researching the menus and backgrounds of both Valentino's and Imo's Pizza. Step 2: Examine the menu offerings I will carefully analyze the menu offerings of both restaurants to determine the proportion and focus on pizza compared to other food items. Valentino's menu: I find that Valentino's offers a variety of pizzas, pasta, sandwiches, seafood, and desserts. While they do have a wide range of pizzas, there are also significant non-pizza options on their menu. Imo's Pizza menu: I find that Imo's Pizza also offers a variety of pizzas, along with salads, sandwiches, pasta, and appetizers. While pizza is the main focus, they also have various non-pizza options. Step 3: Compare pizza options To compare the focus on pizza between the two restaurants, we must assess the number and variety of pizza choices. Valentino's pizza options: I find that Valentino's offers a range of specialty pizzas and allows for custom toppings, giving customers a good variety of pizza choices. Imo's Pizza options: I find that Imo's Pizza also offers a range of specialty pizzas and custom toppings, emphasizing their focus on pizza. Step 4: Analyze other factors Now, I will consider any other factors that could influence my conclusion, such as customer reviews or restaurant history. Valentino's background: I find that Valentino's has been offering Italian cuisine since 1957, indicating a strong history rooted in Italian food, potentially favoring a more diverse menu. Imo's Pizza background: I find that Imo's Pizza has been in business since 1964 and primarily focuses on St. Louis-style pizza, perhaps suggesting a stronger focus on pizza. Step 5: Draw a conclusion Based on the analysis of menus, pizza options, and restaurant history, it appears that while both Valentino's and Imo's Pizza have a range of non-pizza offerings, Imo's Pizza may have a slightly stronger focus on pizza due to their history and dedication to St. Louis-style pizza. However, the difference in focus is not significantly pronounced, as both offer a variety of pizzas and other dishes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Context: WASHINGTON — Republicans in the U.S. House of Representative plan to hold a vote next week on an immigration bill despite Trump urging them Friday to abandon efforts to pass legislation until after the mid-term elections. Even if the Republicans — who have a majority in both the House and Senate — approve a bill, it faces almost certain defeat in the upper chamber where Democrats hold enough seats to prevent Republicans, even if they all vote together, from reaching the 60 votes needed for passage. Earlier in the week, the president had called for Congress to quickly approve sweeping immigration legislation. But in a Friday tweet the president said, \\"Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November. Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!\\" Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican representing a majority Hispanic district in the state of Florida, who is not running for re-election, termed the president's tweets \\"schizoid policy making.\\" Another retiring lawmaker, Republican Congressman Mark Sanford of South Carolina, a frequent Trump critic who recently lost his primary election, said Trump's reversal sends \\"a horrifically chilling signal\\" that \\"makes immigration reform that much more unlikely.\\" On Saturday, California Democratic Senator Kamala Harris spoke in Otay Mesa, a community in San Diego, at a rally for revised immigration policies. \\"This is a fight born out of knowing who we are and fighting for the ideals of our country,\\" she said.

Please answer the following question: What is the last name of the band member that wrote all the lyrics on the album that went to number one in UK?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  In 1982, Waters suggested a new musical project with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall. With the onset of the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album. With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure. Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself. Released in March 1983, The Final Cut went straight to number one in the UK and number six in the US. Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the album. Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused. Gilmour later commented: \\"I'm certainly guilty at times of being lazy ... but he wasn't right about wanting to put some duff tracks on The Final Cut.\\" Rolling Stone magazine gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder calling it \\"a superlative achievement ... art rock's crowning...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Gilliam was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the son of Beatrice (nee Vance) and James Hall Gilliam. His father was a travelling salesman for Folgers before becoming a carpenter. Soon after, they moved to nearby Medicine Lake, Minnesota. The family moved to the Los Angeles neighbourhood of Panorama City in 1952. The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, directed and co-written by Gilliam, was released in 2009. In January 2007, Gilliam announced that he had been working on a new project with his writing partner Charles McKeown. One day later, the fansite Dreams reported that the new project was titled The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus. In October 2007, Dreams confirmed that this would be Gilliam's next project and was slated to star Christopher Plummer and Tom Waits. Production began in December 2007 in London.  On 22 January 2008, production of the film was disrupted following the death of Heath Ledger in New York City. Variety reported that Ledger's involvement had been a \\"key factor\\" in the film's financing. Production was suspended indefinitely by 24 January, but in February the actors Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell signed on to continue Ledger's role, transforming into multiple incarnations of his character in the \\"magical\\" world of the film. Thanks to this arrangement the principal photography was completed on 15 April 2008, on schedule. Editing was completed in November 2008. According to the official ParnassusFilm Twitter channel launched on 30 March 2009, the film's post-production FX work finished on 31 March. During the filming, Gilliam was accidentally hit by a bus and suffered a broken back.  The film had successful screenings including a premiere at the 62nd Cannes Film Festival. The UK release for the film was scheduled for 6 June 2009 but was pushed back to 16 October 2009. The USA release was on 25 December 2009. Eventually, this 30 million-budgeted film had grossed more than 60 million in worldwide theatrical release and received two Academy Award nominations.  The film's end credit states that the film is dedicated to the memories of Ledger and William Vince. Depp, Farrell, and Law donated their proceeds from the film to Ledger's daughter.

Summarize this article: Stomach discomfort, including ulcers, may contribute to some horses' desire to crib. By switching to a diet that helps reduce ulcers, such as alfalfa hay, you may help eliminate stomach problems, which in turn,  may reduce the horse's cribbing. If your horse is already on alfalfa, you may want to try other options for reducing cribbing.  Change your horse's diet over slowly. Begin mixing some of the new diet in with the old a little at a time, gradually adding more each day. That will help reduce digestive issues. If you suspect that ulcers are causing your horse's cribbing, it's best to get your veterinarian to do a scope of its stomach to get a proper diagnosis. If ulcers are present, your vet can provide you with treatment options and ways to manage the ulcers, which will help heal your horse and reduce the cribbing. Sugary feeds may encourage your horse to crib more, so opt for a low-sugar version, like plain oats, when you're feeding grains in addition to hay. It may be that sugar lights up the same reward center in the brain that cribbing does, so when your horse gets sugar, it may want to keep the feeling going. Look for feeds that have a higher percentage of fat and fiber rather than starch and sugar. You can also try giving the horse hay before you feed it grain, which may cut down on cribbing, as well. If a horse has something to keep its mouth occupied, namely hay or a large pasture for grazing, it's less likely to crib. By having hay around, you encourage the horse to nibble on the hay throughout the day instead of inappropriate things like your barn or your fences. If your horse has trouble with overeating, try a slow feeder. These feeders give your horse a little bit of hay at a time, slowing down how much it can take, but your horse will still be nibbling most of the time. Because stomach discomfort may contribute to cribbing, have your horse seen by the vet if you haven't already. That way, the vet can rule out any stomach problems, such as ulcers or other intestinal issues, that you'll want to get taken care of.  Your vet may suggest an antacid for certain conditions. If your horse doesn't have a stomach problem and cribbing has been a chronic problem, your vet may suggest having surgery to help prevent cribbing.","output":"The article discusses how stomach discomfort and ulcers may be a contributing factor to a horse's desire to crib. To address this issue, it is suggested to switch the horse's diet to one that reduces the risk of ulcers, such as alfalfa hay. If the horse is already on an alfalfa diet, other options for reducing cribbing should be explored. It is essential to change the horse's diet gradually to avoid digestive issues. This can be done by slowly mixing the new diet with the old one, increasing the proportions of the new diet incrementally. If ulcers are suspected as the cause of cribbing, having a veterinarian perform a stomach scope is crucial to obtaining a proper diagnosis. If ulcers are detected, the vet can recommend treatment options and management strategies to heal the horse and reduce cribbing behavior. Sugary feeds should be avoided, as they may encourage cribbing in horses. Instead, opt for low-sugar options, such as plain oats, when feeding grains in addition to hay. Feeds with higher fat and fiber content, rather than starch and sugar, are preferable. Providing hay before feeding grain to the horse may also help in reducing cribbing. Providing ample hay or a large grazing area for the horse is important, as it keeps the horse's mouth occupied and reduces the likelihood of cribbing. Implementing a slow feeder can be helpful if a horse tends to overeat, as it allows the horse to nibble on hay throughout the day instead of indulging in inappropriate behavior like chewing on barns or fences. Lastly, consulting a veterinarian is vital to rule out any stomach issues, such as ulcers or intestinal problems, which may be causing the horse to crib. The vet may suggest antacids for specific conditions or recommend surgery if cribbing has been a long-term problem and no stomach issues are detected. Overall, addressing stomach discomfort, altering the horse's diet, and providing ample hay or grazing opportunities may significantly help reduce cribbing behavior in horses."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As per the passage, not all woods exhibit similar characteristics in their growth rings, and these characteristics can change based on the type of wood. Commonly, the part of a growth ring that is closest to the center of the tree, known as earlywood or springwood, is formed early in the growing season when the growth rate is rapid. This portion is often composed of wider elements and tends to be lighter in color than the outer portion of the ring.

However, these descriptions may not apply uniform to all types of woods. There may be variations in the structure, color, and composition of the growth rings in different kinds of wood. Therefore, when the botanist inspects the rings in one oak tree and then in an elm tree, they might observe significant differences in these properties.  This analysis of the structure and formation of tree rings could be particularly beneficial for understanding the growth patterns, environmental conditions, and overall history of the tree, which are factors typically crucial in botanical and ecological studies.

In particular, I began to hunt down the available fixed-width or monospaced fonts.    What are monospaced fonts you ask? From Xerox:Monospace fonts (Such as Courier or LetterGothic), or \\"fixed pitch\\" fonts, contain characters that all have the same character width, producing text that can be used to create forms, tabular material or documents that require exact text line lengths. An example of a fixed pitch font is Courier 12 pitch, which is a 10 point font that will print at exactly 12 characters per inch.    Why use  monospaced fonts? Primarily because the text will align more readily. Especially is areas like the comment block header.

Bonus: Antony Jenkins, who took over from Bob Diamond as chief executive of Barclays, is set to receive a bonus of £1 million. Barclays triggered outrage last night as it emerged it plans to pay its new boss a £1million bonus despite being engulfed in scandal last year. Antony Jenkins, who took over from Bob Diamond as chief executive at the end of August with a brief to clean up the bank’s image, is being lined up for a seven-figure payout on top of his £1.1million salary. However, critics say Barclays should not pay such big bonuses for 2012 – a year when its name was dragged through the mud. In total, it is thought the bank is preparing to pay up to £2billion in bonuses for the last financial year. But Barclays was forced to cough up £290million over its involvement in the Libor interest-rate rigging scandal – a humiliating episode which cost Mr Diamond his job. It has also been accused of aggressive tax avoidance and mis-selling products such as payment protection insurance to unsuspecting customers. The row over bonuses at Barclays came a day after it emerged that RBS was planning to pay its investment bankers £250million for 2012, despite being more than 80 per cent owned by taxpayers. Critics reacted with anger to the prospect of another round of bumper bonuses following a year of shame for the industry. Richard Lloyd, executive director of Which?, said: ‘Recent scandals have decimated consumer confidence, and the public will be rightly outraged if senior bankers get huge bonuses despite their failings. Cleanup: Mr Jenkins, who previously ran the Barclays retail banking arm and the credit cards division Barclaycard, was appointed chief executive to clean up the bank's tarnished image. Mega pay: Mr Jenkins's pay pales in comparison to Diamond's, who earned £17 million in 2011. ‘Excessive bonuses shouldn’t even be. contemplated where there is evidence of mis-selling or rate-rigging. Past bonuses should be clawed back from those who presided over. wrongdoing.’ Mr Jenkins was appointed as a ‘new. broom’ after the bank plunged into crisis under Mr Diamond. As chief. executive, his total package will be up to £8.6million, including a. salary of £1.1million, a bonus of up to £2.75million, shares in an. incentive plan worth up to £4.4million and a cash allowance of £363,000. instead of a pension. Labour MP Chris Leslie, a shadow. Treasury minister, said: ‘While our economy is shrinking it looks set to. be another bumper bonus round for bankers. 'There should be fair rewards for performance, but these bonuses follow the Libor fixing and mis-selling scandals.’ Reward: It is thought the bank is preparing to pay a total of between £1.5 billion and £2 billion in bonuses to its staff for 2012. Barclays sources insisted no decisions on bonuses have been taken and insisted pay is ‘something we want to bring down’. The bank paid out a total of £2.2billion in bonuses for 2011. MPs were told yesterday that a. generation of young people are being put off saving because of the. record-low base interest rate of 0.5 per cent. Experts also savaged the Bank’s. £375billion quantitative-easing policy, with one telling the Treasury. Select Committee that it was ‘an appalling confiscation of wealth’ from. pensioners. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"The article, published on January 29, 2013, focuses on the controversy surrounding Barclays' plan to award its then-new CEO, Antony Jenkins, a £1 million bonus in addition to his £1.1 million salary.

The scandal resulted in previous CEO Bob Diamond losing his position. Barclays was preparing to pay up to £2 billion in bonuses for the last financial year, while the bank had to pay a £290 million fine for its involvement in the Libor scandal.

(CNN) -- Anwar al-Awlaki was killed exactly one week after President Ali Abdullah Saleh returned to Yemen at the end of a long period of medical treatment in Saudi Arabia. Intelligence analysts say that may have been no coincidence, and that with al-Awlaki's killing, Saleh is underlining to the West -- and the Saudis -- that they still need him. Saleh's return was something of a surprise both to Yemenis and the international community. He had been seen as the main stumbling block to political dialogue and a transition to fresh elections sponsored by the Gulf Cooperation Council. But several analysts consulted by CNN said the Saudis were concerned that the growing unrest in Yemen could morph into outright civil war -- in a country that shares a long and porous desert border with the kingdom.

Choices:  - milk machine - farmyard - countryside - fairgrounds - long horns  The rationale to choose \\"countryside\\" as the answer is that: The answer to this question is:","output":"The cows longed for the countryside. Rationale: Cows are domesticated animals primarily raised for agricultural purposes, such as providing milk and meat. They naturally thrive in rural settings, where they have ample space for grazing, roaming, and socializing with other cows. In the city, they face noise pollution, confined spaces, and an unfamiliar environment that can cause them stress and discomfort. Given this context, the cows would naturally long for their typical habitat, which is the countryside. Here's a brief overview of the other choices: - Milk machine: This is a device used to extract milk from cows, not a place for the cows to prefer or an environment they could long for. - Farmyard: While cows may be more comfortable in a farmyard compared to a city, the term \\"farmyard\\" specifically refers to the area where farm buildings and structures are located, not the pasture or grazing areas where the cows would typically spend their time. - Fairgrounds: This is a place where fairs, carnivals, or exhibitions are held. It is not the usual habitat for cows, so it's not what they would long for when lost in a city. - Long horns: This refers to the long and curved pair of horns found in some cattle breeds, such as the Texas Longhorn. However, long horns are a physical characteristic, not a location or environment, so it doesn't fit the context of the question. In conclusion, the rationale for choosing \\"countryside\\" is that it's the most natural and appropriate environment for cows where they can roam freely, graze, and socialize without the stress and discomfort they experience in the noisy city."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This analysis helps them determine if their involvement aligns with their priorities. 2. Be clear and direct: Successful people understand that being straightforward is the most effective approach since it minimizes confusion and misinterpretation. They express their stance without ambiguity or hesitation. 3. Be respectful and tactful: Rejecting a request or declining an invitation doesn't mean being impolite or inconsiderate. Successful people say \\"no\\" politely and respectfully, showing empathy and understanding while asserting their boundaries. 4. Offer an explanation (if appropriate): Providing a brief, honest explanation can help others understand why they are unable to commit. This transparency helps maintain trust and credibility while still declining the request. 5. Suggest alternatives: If possible, successful people might propose alternative solutions or resources that could help the requester. This way, they demonstrate that they are not disregarding the issue entirely, just declining personal involvement. 6.

The committee members also heard evidence of a 22-year-old man going unpunished after being found in a car with a 12-year-old girl, a bottle of vodka and indecent images of her on his mobile phone. Committee chairman Keith Vaz asked Mr Etheridge how many successful prosecutions there had been this year for child sex exploitation. \\"None,\\" was the answer, and just one in 2010 and eight in 2008. Mr Vaz said: \\"I am very disappointed and I am very surprised nobody has been prosecuted this year ... you need to get a grip on the situation in South Yorkshire.\\" He added: \\"I want you to write to us in a month's time setting out what has been done. \\"The committee is very concerned and the public are very concerned.\\" Mr Vaz added the force needed to approach the issue with the same rigour it was bringing to its dealings with the Hillsborough investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. The abuse of young girls in Rotherham, and also in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, came to light after a series of investigations by The Times. The newspaper claimed documents it obtained show agencies were aware of extensive and co-ordinated abuse of white girls by some Asian men in Rotherham for which no one has been prosecuted. The paper said a confidential 2010 police report warned that thousands of such crimes were committed in South Yorkshire each year. South Yorkshire Police have previously denied any suggestion they had been reluctant to tackle child sexual abuse and pointed to a series of successful criminal convictions. Mr Crompton was asked today if \\"ethnic origin was a factor\\" in the Crown Prosecution Service charging suspects. \\"No, it's not a factor at all,\\" he said. Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"The article discusses the criticism of David Crompton and Det Ch Insp Philip Etheridge by the Home Affairs Select Committee due to a lack of successful prosecutions in South Yorkshire for child sex exploitation.

Please answer the following question: In the year 1630 during the month of January Captain Cook began his voyage from the port of Calais in Europe, which is in the Northern Hemisphere. His intention was  to find the mythical land in the Southern Hemisphere. After about eleven months of sailing, in December 1630, he reached Australia, which is indeed in the Southern Hemisphere. Thinking he finally reached the mythical  land, he commenced his return voyage to Europe on June,  1631, He reached Europe in the middle of the following year on July, 1632.  Which place received less direct sunlight when Captain Cook started his voyage to the mythical land in 1630, Europe or Australia? A:","output":"When Captain Cook started his voyage to the mythical land in January 1630, Europe received less direct sunlight compared to Australia. This is because January falls during the winter season in the Northern Hemisphere, where Europe is located. In the Southern Hemisphere, where Australia is located, January falls during the summer season. As a result, Europe experienced shorter days and less direct sunlight compared to Australia, which had longer days and more direct sunlight at that time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The encounter touched the hearts of the local community, and Kayleigh has chosen to spread her newfound fortune by using the money to visit her mother in North Wales over the Christmas holidays. On an otherwise ordinary day, Kayleigh Moran, a resident of Ashton, had just finished her shopping when she was stopped by an elderly man, believed to be in his 70s. The gentleman handed her an envelope, instructing her to open it only once he was out of sight. Unsure of what to make of the situation, Kayleigh followed his instructions and opened the envelope after the gentleman had discreetly left the scene. To her surprise and delight, the envelope contained a card along with £200 in cash. Stunned by the unexpected and heartwarming gesture, Kayleigh found herself searching for answers to the questions that sprung to her mind – Who was this man? What motivated him to offer such generosity to a complete stranger? Unfortunately, the generous man has yet to be identified, leaving a sense of mystery and wonder surrounding this act of kindness. Kayleigh has decided to pay it forward by using the gifted money to visit her mother over the Christmas holidays. The two women have not seen each other in some time due to the challenges brought on by the pandemic, which makes this seemingly minor act of kindness feel even more significant. In a time when the world seems full of uncertainties, this simple and kind gesture has had a profound impact on those who have learned of the story.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"No, the answer you provided pertains to the history of country music in Tennessee, not how it became a state.  Tennessee became a state on June 1, 1796, when it was admitted as the 16th state in the union. The process of statehood began with the signing of the Treaty of Holston between the United States and the Cherokee people in 1791, which opened up the territory for settlement.  The Southwest Territory, which included most of modern-day Tennessee, was established in 1790 under the administration of President George Washington and led by Territorial Governor William Blount. As the population in this territory grew, demands for statehood increased. In 1795, a census determined that the Southwest Territory had achieved the population requirement of 60,000 free inhabitants, making it eligible for statehood under the rules of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. A constitutional convention was held in Knoxville in January 1796, during which delegates drafted a state constitution and selected John Sevier as the first governor of Tennessee. The drafted constitution was submitted to the United States Congress for approval, and after a few minor adjustments, President George Washington signed the bill admitting Tennessee to the Union on June 1, 1796. So, Tennessee became a state due to a combination of increased settlement, population growth, and the successful establishment of a state government under the guidelines provided by the United States Congress."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Standing on a high walkway of planks behind the palisade of the crusaders' small wooden fort, he heard faraway voices and saw torches moving on the Cathar rampart. The two men on watch with him that night, a sergeant from Champagne and a young man-at-arms from Brittany, were talking in low tones about the women to be had far below, at the foot of the mountain. They seemed not to see the activity about the Cathar stronghold on the upper peak of the mountaintop opposite their own fort. But Roland, knowing Diane was in the besieged fortress, could not take his eyes from it. He knew he had to act soon. Each day the crusaders grew stronger and the Cathars weaker. Once the Cathar stronghold fell, the crusaders would slaughter all within, including Diane. The sergeant, chuckling, was offering his young companion a wineskin. The Breton never received it. From behind the Cathar wall came the sound of a huge thump, as if a giant's fist had pounded Mont Segur. Roland recognized the sound, and fought panic as he thrust his arms out, trying to push the other two men toward the ladder. But there was no time for them to climb down to safety. The thump was the counter-weight of a stone-caster, and the whistling noise that followed fast upon it was the rock it had thrown. A shape as big as a wine barrel blotted out the stars. The stone hit the parapet beside Roland, and the whole palisade shuddered.

Write an article based on this summary: Measure the size of your locket’s image space, if possible. Estimate the size of your image space, if difficult to measure. Measure the diameter instead of the width if your locket is round. Article:","output":"# Crafting the Perfect Memory: Sizing Your Locket's Image Space A locket is a classic piece of jewelry that carries a unique sentiment, as it serves as a personal treasure chest for precious memories. Inside its compact frame, you can store a photograph of your loved ones, encapsulating a moment in time with just a glance. However, fitting the right photo size for your locket requires some effort. This article will guide you on how to measure the size of your locket's image space and help you create the perfect personalized keepsake.  Step 1: Assess the Locket's Image Space Accessibility Before you get started, determine whether the image space in your locket can be measured with ease. Some lockets have removable frames, making it simple to measure accurately. In contrast, others might have a rigid or uniquely shaped frame that makes measurement difficult. If you're unsure, take a closer look and decide if your locket falls into the easy or complicated category for measuring.  Step 2: Measure the Size of Your Locket's Image Space Once you have assessed the accessibility of your locket's image space, the next step is to measure it. For this, you'll need a ruler or an electronic caliper for better accuracy. # Easy-to-Measure Lockets If your locket has a removable frame, carefully open it and take the frame out. Lay the frame down on a flat surface and measure its dimensions using the ruler or caliper. Record the width and height of the frame, which determines the size of the photograph that will fit in your locket. # Difficult-to-Measure Lockets If your locket is challenging to measure due to its design or accessibility, follow these steps to estimate the image space: 1. First, close your locket and measure the diameter if it's round or the width and height if it's a different shape. 2. Open the locket and compare the interior edges to the dimensions you just measured. 3. Adjust your measurements accordingly if the interior space is smaller than the external dimensions. 4. Keep in mind that you might have to adjust your photo's size slightly once it's placed inside the locket.  Step 3: Select the Right Sized Photo and Place it in Your Locket After measuring the dimensions of your locket's image space, choose a photograph that can be resized to fit perfectly. Use photo-editing software or consult a professional to resize your selected image according to the measurements obtained. Print the resized photograph on photographic paper, and carefully cut it to size using scissors or a paper cutter. Now that you have the perfectly sized photo, open your locket and gently place the picture inside the frame. If you have a removable frame, insert it back into the locket. Make any final adjustments to ensure the photo sits snugly within the confines of the locket before closing it securely. And there you have it – your locket, a treasure trove of memories, is now complete with a perfectly fitted photo. Follow these steps to craft your personalized keepsake and keep your cherished memories close to your heart."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - The Arctic Ocean is the smallest and shallowest of the world's five major oceans. The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) recognizes it as an ocean, although some oceanographers call it the Arctic Mediterranean Sea or simply the Arctic Sea, classifying it a mediterranean sea or an estuary of the Atlantic Ocean. Alternatively, the Arctic Ocean can be seen as the northernmost part of the all-encompassing World Ocean.  - Continental Europe, also referred to as mainland Europe, or, by Europeans, simply the Continent, is the continuous continent of Europe, excluding surrounding islands.  - The ZX Spectrum is an 8-bit personal home computer released in the United Kingdom in 1982 by Sinclair Research Ltd.

The term is also commonly extended in modern English and other vernaculars to the inhabitants of Viking home communities during what has become known as the Viking Age. This period of Nordic military, mercantile and demographic expansion constitutes an important element in the early medieval history of Scandinavia, Estonia, the British Isles, France, Kievan Rus' and Sicily.  - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world.

Being independently administered jurisdictions, they do not form part of either the United Kingdom or the British Overseas Territories. They are self-governing possessions of the Crown (defined uniquely in each jurisdiction). Internationally, the dependencies are considered \\"territories for which the United Kingdom is responsible\\" rather than as sovereign states. As a result, they are not member states of the Commonwealth of Nations. However, they do have a relationship with the Commonwealth, the European Union, and other international organisations and are members of the BritishIrish Council. They are not part of the European Union (EU), although they are within the EU's customs area.  - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).  - The Northern Hemisphere is the half of Earth that is north of the equator. For other planets in the Solar System, north is defined as being in the same celestial hemisphere relative to the invariable plane of the solar system as Earth's North pole. Due to the Earth's axial tilt, winter in the Northern Hemisphere lasts from the December solstice (typically December 21 UTC) to the March Equinox (typically March 20 UTC), while summer lasts from the June solstice (typically June 21 UTC) through to the September equinox (typically September 23 UTC). The dates vary each year due to the difference between the calendar year and the astronomical year.  - West Sussex is a county in the south of England, bordering East Sussex (with Brighton and Hove) to the east, Hampshire to the west and Surrey to the north, and to the south the English Channel. Chichester in the southwest is the county town and only city in West Sussex, with the largest towns being Crawley, Worthing and Horsham.

QUEBEC CITY — Emotions were on display when U.S. President Donald Trump met other G-7 leaders at their annual summit in Canada on Friday, but the discussions were civilized and diplomatic, according to sources. Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). She said Canada, however, will not change its mind about the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs which she termed “illegal.” Trump imposed the tariffs on the grounds that weak domestic industries could affect U.S. national security. America’s closest allies, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, are introducing retaliatory tariffs. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: After the end of this story, Trump probably is: Options: - enemies with Trudeau - Allies with Trudeau - not enough information - allies with Clinton","output":"After the end of this story, Trump is probably allies with Trudeau. Although they had disagreements over trade policies and tariffs, Trump allegedly joked about Trudeau agreeing to cut tariffs and described their cross-border relationship as very good. Moreover, Trump stated that they were working on cutting tariffs and making trade fair between both countries, which suggests that they are not enemies and are actually cooperating to some extent."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The primary difference between their experiments is the temperature at which they are conducting the reactions. It is crucial to understand how temperature affects the motion of particles in a reaction. The movement of particles is directly influenced by an increase or decrease in temperature. The kinetic molecular theory states that particles possess kinetic energy, which increases with increasing temperature. This higher kinetic energy allows the particles to move more rapidly, which, in turn, allows them to collide more frequently. In this case, Justin is conducting his reactions at a higher temperature compared to Thomas. Consequently, the acid and base particles in Justin's reaction will possess greater kinetic energy due to the higher temperature. As a result, these particles will move faster, leading to increased frequency of collisions between the molecules. Comparatively, the particles in Thomas's reaction will have relatively lower kinetic energy because of the lower temperature at which his reaction takes place. The acid and base particles in Thomas's reaction will move comparatively slower than those in Justin's reaction, resulting in fewer collisions between the molecules. Therefore, based on the given information and applying the principles of the kinetic molecular theory, the acid and base particles will move faster in Justin's reaction due to the higher temperature at which he conducts his experiment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Who plays Carlos? Movie title: The Woodsman Movie plot: Walter (Kevin Bacon), a convicted child molester, returns home to Philadelphia after serving 12 years in prison. His friends and family have abandoned him, with the exception of his brother-in-law, Carlos (Benjamin Bratt). Walter's apartment is just across the street from an elementary schoolâan obvious source of temptation. He gets a job at a local lumber mill and meets Vicki (Kyra Sedgwick), one of the few women working there. After sleeping with Vicki, Walter tells her that he molested little girls, but rationalizes his crimes by saying \\"I didn't hurt them.\\" Vicki is clearly shocked and disturbed by this new information, but before she can consider how to respond to it, Walter tells her to leave his apartment. Walter receives frequent visits from a suspicious, verbally abusive police officer named Lucas (Mos Def). Lucas makes it clear that he is waiting to catch Walter reoffending. Watching the school, Walter sees a man offering candy to little boys in an apparent effort to gain their confidence. He realizes that this man, whom he nicknames \\"Candy\\" (Kevin Rice), is another child molester. Walter also meets an apparently lonely young girl named Robin (Hannah Pilkes) who is a bird watcher. Walter sees Candy abduct a boy; however, he does not report this to the police. Walter's life takes a further downturn when a suspicious co-worker, Mary-Kay (Eve), learns of his conviction and alerts the entire mill. Some of the employees attack Walter, but Vicki and the boss of the mill come to his defense. Ostracized and frustrated, Walter leaves his workplace and goes to the park. Vicki, fearing the worst, begins to search for him. Walter ends up meeting with Robin at the park. As they talk, he begins to succumb to his desires and invites Robin to sit on his lap. She politely refuses, but then begins to confide in him. As she begins to cry, Walter realizes that she is being molested by her father.

A strong woman oriented subject after long, director Krishna Vamsi's Shakti- The Power, the Desi version of the Hollywood hit Not Without My Daughter is actress Sridevi's first home-production. A story about a woman's fight against harsh injustice. The story of the film revolves around Nandini (Karisma Kapoor) who lives in Canada with her two uncles (Tiku Talsania, Jaspal Bhatti). There she meets Shekhar (Sanjay Kapoor), falls in love with him and they soon marry. Their family is complete when Nandini has a boy, Raja (Master Jai Gidwani). But their happiness is short lived, as the news of Shekhar's ailing mother (Deepti Naval)makes them leave their perfect life in Canada and come to India. And that's when the problems start. From the moment they reach India, both are shocked to see the pollution and the vast throngs of people everywhere. They take a crowded train to reach Shekhar's village and when they finally reach the station, they have to catch a long bus drive to his village. The filthy sweaty bus combined with the uncertain terrain makes it a never-ending drive. And unfortunately for them, a frenzied mob that beat Shekhar out of shape for no fault of his attacks their bus. Fortunately, they get shot dead just in time before they can further harm him. After that, they drive to the handing Havel where Shekhar''s father, Narsimha (Nana Patekar) lives with his wife (Deepti Naval). Nandani realized that her father-in-law is in command as soon as she enters the place, but her only solace is her mother-in-law's warm welcome. Living there, Nandini learns of her father-in-laws tyrannical behavior and realizes that ruthless killing is a way of life for him. The day she sees her father-in-law teach her son to throw a bomb, she loses it and lashes out against him, insisting to Shekhar that they move back to Canada. But terror strikes again when Shekhar is murdered one day, leaving a broken down Nandini alone with her son in this strange land where she is harrowed by a cruel father-in-law. Her fight against this man to save her son is what makes up the climax of this emotional heart-wrenching film. What sets apart Shakti from most films being made off late is also the rural setting of the movie. The only drawback is Ismail Darbar''s music, which fails to rise above the script. The only saving grace is the sexy item number Ishq Kameena, which has been composed by Anu Malik. Another pat for the director comes because he has extracted some splendid performances from his cast. Karisma Kapoor is the life of the film and has given a moving performance as a helpless mother. She is sure to win awards for this heated portrayal. Second is actor Nana Patekar who is back with a bang with this film. His uncouth mannerisms suit him to the hilt and he's shown his versatility once again with this role. Sanjay Kapoor is the surprise packet of the film with a sincere and effective portrayal that stands up against both the other actors. Deepti Naval too is in top form and her Pr-climax showdown with Nana is praiseworthy. Shahrukh's cameo provides the lighter moments and surely he's been pulled in to get the required star value. Though his role was not really required, he's done it well. Overall, Shakti is a far superior film than most churned out these days and the Pr-release hype is sure to get it a good opening. Shakti is sure to get the critics and audience thumps up. So what if the film needs to be desperately trimmed by at least 2 reels to better the impact.

In a candid address, the minister emphasized the importance of addressing the complex challenges surrounding the future of the Palestinians, while maintaining a steadfast position on the safety and sovereignty of their country. The foreign minister acknowledged the historical complexities of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which dates back to centuries of tensions and political clashes. The minister began their address by reiterating their commitment to ensuring peace and stability in the region, recognizing the need for a sustainable resolution to the ongoing strife. However, they asserted that lasting peace cannot be achieved without a mutual understanding and respect for the needs and aspirations of both Israeli and Palestinian people. To this end, the minister advocated for the establishment of a dialogue that enables candid discussions on the various solutions, emphasizing the importance of considering all legitimate options to address the Palestinian quest for self-determination. The minister argued that dialogue should not only involve governmental leaders but must also engage the voices and demands of Palestinian people, as well as encourage support and cooperation from the international community. Despite their clear advocacy for dialogue and discussion, the hard-line foreign minister expressed their concerns and reservations about the implications of granting full statehood to the Palestinians. They underscored the necessity of evaluating the potential consequences of statehood across numerous dimensions, including regional security, economic development, and political stability. The minister stressed that any potential solution should not undermine the territorial integrity and security of existing states, or give rise to further instability and conflicts in the region. Moreover, the foreign minister emphasized that the expansion of illegal settlements and the overall disregard of international law by some factions pose significant threats to achieving a harmonious coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians. The minister called for strict adherence to international law and reaffirmed their commitment to working closely with regional and international partners to address such challenges effectively. The minister made clear that the pursuit of Palestinian statehood should not entail any compromises on substantial issues such as the security and well-being of Israeli citizens or the overall stability of the region. Yet, they also emphasized that the pursuit of peace requires dedication, transparency, and the willingness to explore multiple avenues to achieve lasting stability. In conclusion, the hard-line foreign minister communicated their concerns and outlined their views on the complex issue of Palestinian statehood. By advocating for open dialogue, adherence to international law, and a comprehensive approach to resolving conflicts, the minister demonstrated their commitment to preserving stability and peace in the region, while considering the aspirations and rights of the Palestinian people. Balancing these core principles is undoubtedly a challenging endeavor, but the foreign minister expressed hope that a long-lasting, equitable resolution can be achieved through collective efforts of all stakeholders involved in the peace process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process:  - You place aluminum cans and other products into recycling bins - Your town or a private company collect and transport the aluminum to a recycling facility - The aluminum is sorted and cleaned at the central recycling facility - The aluminum is melted down to remove coatings and inks - The melted aluminum is formed into large formations called ingots - The ingots are transported to another facility and rolled out to make them easier to manipulate - The ingots can now be turned into new aluminum products.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more water molecules split into oxygen happens, how will it affect LESS aluminum cans being recycled.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you mentioned involves an increase in water molecules splitting into oxygen. This process, also known as water electrolysis, doesn't seem to have a direct effect on the recycling process of aluminum cans.  However, there could be a potential indirect effect that we can consider: the increased production of oxygen from water electrolysis might result in an abundant availability of oxygen. Oxygen is required for the production of aluminum from its ore, bauxite, through a process called the Hall-Héroult process. If the electrolysis-generated oxygen were utilized in aluminum production, it might lead to a greater production of new aluminum. In turn, the increased availability of new aluminum could potentially reduce the demand for recycled aluminum. It's worth noting that this hypothesis is quite speculative, as aluminum recycling is an essential practice to save energy and resources regardless of oxygen availability, mainly because producing aluminum from recycled materials requires much less energy compared to producing it from bauxite ore. Additionally, water electrolysis-generated oxygen would need to be economically competitive and viable for use in aluminum production for it to have any significant effect on the aluminum recycling process.  In summary, while the perturbation hypothesis does not have a direct effect on aluminum can recycling, there could be a potential indirect effect on the demand for recycled aluminum if oxygen generated from water electrolysis is used in aluminum production on a large scale. However, this scenario is speculative and would rely on several factors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Tampa Bay got off to a slow start as Kansas City took the opening drive 69 yards for a touchdown. On Tampa Bay's first play from scrimmage, Earnest Graham fumbled and the Chiefs recovered. The turnover led to another Kansas City touchdown, and a 14-0 lead. Early in the second quarter, Tampa Bay drove into the red zone, and scored a field goal. On the following drive, the Chiefs executed a flea-flicker play and quarterback Tyler Thigpen caught an improbable 37-yard touchdown pass. Late in the second quarter, the Chiefs added a field goal, to stretch the lead to 24-3. On the ensuing kickoff, Clifton Smith scored a 97-yard kickoff return touchdown, the second such in franchise history. The Buccaneer defense held the Chiefs to a 3-and-out, and the offense took over with 1:08 to go. As time expired in the half, Matt Bryant's second field goal trimmed the deficit to 24-13. Neither team scored in the third quarter, and all drives ended in punts. Early in the fourth quarter, Jeff Garcia again drove Tampa Bay into the red zone. Clifton Smith caught a pass, but fumbled at the 13. Kansas City recovered at their own 10. On the very next play, Jamaal Charles fumbled away a pitch in the backfield, and Tampa Bay recovered inside the 3. In a trick play, Jeff Garcia handed off to Earnest Graham, who passed to Alex Smith for a touchdown. A two-point conversion failed, and the score trimmed to 24-19. With 3:34 to go, the Buccaneers drove to the Kansas City 3, and Earnest Graham appeared to be heading for a potential game-tying score. The ball was fumbled, however, and the Chiefs took over on a touchback. The Buccaneer defense forced a punt, and they took over with 1:50 to go. Jeff Garcia quickly drove the Buccaneers to a 25-yard touchdown, and a two-point conversion catch by Alex Smith sent the game to overtime. In the overtime period, Tampa Bay won the coin toss. They drove to the Kansas City 15-yard line, and Matt Bryant won the game on a 34-yard field goal. The victory marked the largest comeback (from 21 points behind to win) in franchise history.

Parents of Brit found in Spain SIX years after disappearing tell of joy at having him home MATTHEW Green, 31, was found at a mental health unit in Spain after vanishing from home in 2010 THE parents of a man who was found in Spain six years after he disappeared have told of their joy at having him home. Matthew Green, 31, disappeared from his home in Sittingbourne, Kent home in 2010 after telling his parents he was going to Mile End in London. SWNS - Bristol +44 (0)1179066550 SWNS - Bristol +44 (0)1179066550 The then 26-year-old never returned, leaving his heartbroken parents wrought with worry. Incredibly Pauline and Jim Green received a call in May to say their son had been found in Spain and was being treated at a mental health hospital. After an incredible outpour of support that saw thousands raised on GoFundMe to help the parents bring their son home, Matt is now back in the UK and being cared for in a special facility. Both parents flew out to Spain to see their son after more than half-a-decade apart before he was brought back to England. A tearful Pauline told This Morning: “He was walking towards us and I knew straight away it was Matt.” She said her son is still “very, very poorly” and faces a long road ahead but added: “There’s a light at the end of the tunnel.” Emotional Pauline told Holly Willougby and Phillip Scholfield the parents were advised to give Matthew space when he arrived back in the UK to let him adjust to the new situation. Pauline said: “He arrived on Wednesday and I phoned the hospital on Thursday to see if he was settling in and ask if they had started treatment.” The concerned mum was told they hadn’t started treatment yet as Matthew’s notes were all in Spanish, but this has now been sorted. She went on: “On the Friday I was pottering around when the house phone went, I answered and he just said ‘hello mum, it’s Matt’. “For six years all I’ve wanted was to hear his voice, to see him and it was just as if he had nipped down the road, or had just gone to the shops or something. “He was just phoning home. It was really, really strange – but lovely.” Matthew is currently placed under a section two, which lasts 28 days and gives him a chance to appeal the section if he wants. If a judge or panel decides he is okay, Matthew could be let out – but it is more likely the section two will be extended to a section two, which can last up to six months. Pauline said: “I know it sounds awful as we’re his mum and dad and we’d like him home obviously, but in the long-term he’s not well enough so six months is great. “I want them to keep him so I know where he is and that he’s safe and can have whatever treatment he needs.” Jim added: “I feel happy, elated we found him. I would like to thank the local community and all the people who have supported us for the money that was raised through GoFundMe, which went towards helping Matt get back home. “People have always said ‘if there’s anything we can do to help’, and I feel they have. It’s so wonderful, we’ve had this following with these people.” Pauline added: “I’ve finally been able to go to bed and sleep, I can have a full night now and it’s such a weight that’s been lifted. “He’s safe and getting the treatment he wants.” Jim added: “We know there are lots of people in the same situation as us and we’d say don’t give up, just keep going.” We pay for your stories!

This major religious and political development brought about significant changes in the region's socio-political dynamics. Early Islamic philosophy emphasized an inexorable link between science and religion, using the process of ijtihad to find truth. This had real implications for governance, making all philosophy \\"political\\" in nature. Initially, the rationalist Mutazilite philosophers posed a challenge to this religious-based worldview, advocating for a more Hellenic view that placed reason above revelation. These philosophers were supported by secular aristocracy seeking greater freedom of action independent of the Caliphate. However, by the late ancient period, the traditionalist Asharite view of Islam, which held that reason must be subordinate to the Quran and the Sunna, had generally triumphed. The spread of Islam not only altered the religious landscape but also the political power balance. Muslim conquests led to the large-scale expansion of the Islamic Caliphate, absorbing former territories of the Byzantine and Sassanian empires. Consequently, the power balance shifted towards the Islamic empire, fundamentally altering the political map of the Mediterranean region. These religious, philosophical, and political changes together brought about a new perception of origin of power in the Mediterranean. Islam became a critical force that reshaped the region's political, religious, and intellectual paradigms for centuries to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person who could not see Ninnis?, using the article: On the evening of 13 December Mawson and Mertz rearranged the sledges. The rear-most sledge, which had carried the most weight, was well-worn, and they decided to abandon it. The remaining supplies were re-distributed between the remaining two sledges. Most of the important supplies—the tent and most of the food—were stored on the new rear sledge; if they were to lose a sledge down a crevasse, they reasoned, it would be the front, less-vital sledge. As the rear sledge was heavier, the strongest of remaining dogs were assigned to pull it. At the camp they left a small amount of supplies, including the abandoned sledge and a tent cover, without the floor or poles.By noon the next day they had covered 311 miles (501 km) from the Cape Denison hut. Mertz was ahead on skis, breaking trail. Mawson sat on the first sledge; Ninnis walked beside the second. In his diary that night, Mertz recounted: Around 1 pm, I crossed a crevasse, similar to the hundred previous ones we had passed during the last weeks. I cried out \\"crevasse!\\", moved at right angle, and went forward. Around five minutes later, I looked behind. Mawson was following, looking at his sledge in front of him. I couldn't see Ninnis, so I stopped to have a better look. Mawson turned round to know the reason I was looking behind me. He immediately jumped out of his sledge, and rushed back. When he nodded his head, I followed him, driving back his sledge. Ninnis, his sledge and dog team had fallen through a crevasse 11 feet (3.4 m) wide with straight, ice walls. On a ledge deep in the hole, Mawson and Mertz could see the bodies of two dogs—one still alive, but seriously injured—and the remains of Ninnis' sledge. There was no sign of their companion. They measured the distance to the ledge as 150 feet (46 m), too far for their ropes to reach. \\"Dog ceased to moan shortly\\", wrote Mawson in his diary that night. \\"We called and sounded for three hours, then went a few miles to a hill and took position observations.

They recline in a silence broken only by whispers and indistinguishable noises. The young man is the son (Alexei Ananishnov) who is taking care of his exhausted sick mother (Gudrun Geyer). Her illness is undefined and from time to time causes her great pain as she gasps for air. Her son combs her hair, feeds her, covers her with a coat, and takes her in his arms. She is totally dependent on him as he himself was once totally dependent on her. As the film progresses, the son carries his mother on a long journey from her sickbed to her deathbed. It is a circular motion which travels a long walk through a dreamlike landscape in the countryside, along winding dirt roads. At each of their brief stops on the journey is a moment of contemplation, caresses, and tender murmurs. These soft murmurs tell of the mother's love for her son when she was nurturing him and of the son's love for his mother as he opens for her the mysterious path to her death.

I have a new situation: Two neighboring dairy farms produced milk for half the state.  Berry farm produced conventional milk, while Rose farm produced organic milk.  But I can use this background: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).

Jill has also since come out of the closet as a lesbian and lives with her partner, Connie (Karen Ludwig), and they are both raising Isaac and Jill's 10-year-old son.When Isaac meets Mary for the first time, her cultural snobbery rubs him the wrong way. Isaac runs into her again at an Equal Rights Amendment fund-raising event at the Museum of Modern Art hosted by Bella Abzug (who is played by herself) and accompanies her on a taxi ride home. They chat until sunrise in a sequence that culminates in the iconic shot of the Queensboro Bridge.In spite of a growing attraction to Mary, Isaac continues his relationship with Tracy but emphasizes that theirs cannot be a serious relationship and encourages her to go to London to study acting. In another iconic scene, at Tracy's request, they go on a carriage ride through Central Park.After Yale breaks up with Mary, he suggests that Isaac ask her out. Isaac does, always having felt that Tracy was too young for him.

ROLAND HELD HIS BODY STIFF AS HE FACED THE CATHAR FORTRESS and watched the tall wooden doors swing open. He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party. Roland reluctantly stepped forward with the other crusaders. His longsword and dagger swung heavy at his waist. He wore them only because, as a knight, he was expected to. He had left his helmet and mail shirt back in his tent.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: Before calculating net worth, it is important to know what it is, and its purpose. The easiest way to define net worth is that it is what you own, minus what you owe. Net worth is how much you would have left over if you were to take everything you own, sell it, and use the proceeds to pay off what you owe.  Your net worth gives you a good idea of your overall wealth and the health of your financial situation. For example, if you have plenty of debt, and own very little, your net worth would be negative, which means your financial situation may not be healthy. This is because if you own a 1,000 computer for example, but owe 20,000 in debt, if you subtract what you owe (the debt) from what you own (the computer), you still owe 19,000. Because you owe 19,000, your net worth would be -19,000. On the other hand, if you own a home worth 100,000, a car worth 20,000, and have a 50,000 mortgage, your net worth would be a positive 70,000 (or 120,000 of assets minus your 50,000 mortgage liability). What you own is also known as your assets. This component of calculating net worth really is as simple — and possibly daunting — as making a dollar value estimate of everything you own, from the car you drive to the contents of your sock drawer.  Don’t worry yet about determining the amount you owe on things like your house or car; that work will come with your liabilities.  The focus now is on establishing the market value of your possessions. That is to say, how much your possessions would sell for if you were able to sell them today. Start your asset counting by making an outline with the following categories: Cash & Cash Equivalents. Investments Retirement Funds. Home. Home furnishings and valuables. Automobiles. Other. Cash is a type of asset. This includes the contents of your bank accounts (like checking, savings, or High Interest Savings Accounts), any physical cash you have on hand, or any cash in investment accounts.  Let’s say, for example, that you have 3,000 in your checking account and 17,000 in your savings account, for a grand total of 20,000 in cash (running total: 20,000). Be careful not to count the value of investments as cash. For example, if you have a Roth IRA account with a mutual fund worth 5,000 in it, do not count that mutual fund as cash, because it is an investment. Perhaps your parents bought you a policy as a kid, or you signed up for one yourself or through work.  If it is a whole life policy that builds cash value, then that cash value is part of your assets.  If you own a whole life insurance policy, there are two values linked to it — cash value and face value. When you pay premiums, part of the premium goes to paying the cost of insurance, and the remainder goes into a cash fund. The value of the cash fund is known as the cash value. The face value is the amount your family receives if you were to die (or the cost of the insurance). If you were to close the policy early, you would receive the cash value.  Count cash value — the amount you would receive if you closed out the policy — not the face value, as being an asset. The cash value of a whole life policy typically builds up slowly to the point where it equals the face value once you reach the end of the mortality table used to establish your policy (often at age 100). Whether you have a substantial portfolio or have just started investing, the current dollar value of such investments is another portion of your overall assets. Investments include things like stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or exchange traded funds.  Let’s imagine that you have 5,000 an investment account. This would give you a running total of 25,000 in assets. Note that running total simple means adding up everything we have so far, so 20,000 in cash plus 5,000 in investments equals 25,000 of total assets. As you are more than likely dealing with hypotheticals and not actually “cashing out” your assets, it is probably unnecessary to factor in any withdrawal penalties for removing funds from an investment account.  But it can’t hurt to be familiar with the details of any penalties you may face in the future. If you have a defined contribution account with your employer, like a 401(k) or 403(b), or an individual retirement plan like an IRA or Roth IRA, these count towards your assets. These are separate from investments, as they cannot be easily liquidated.  For example, imagine you have 15,000 in a 401(k) account with your employer. This bring your running asset total to 25,000 + 15,000, or 40,000. This is where things get a bit more speculative.  Instead of counting up funds, you have to make a best guess about the value of what is likely your most valuable possession — your home.  You need to establish the fair market value for your home — the amount you could expect to fetch for it if you put it on the market.  The most common way to do so is by finding the sale prices for comparable properties, which are those similar in location, size, age, condition, style, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, etc.  How to Determine Market Value for Your Home offers many ideas on identifying “comps” and establishing market value, including:  consulting newspapers, real estate websites, and local tax offices/websites; talking with a real estate agent; and having an appraiser do the estimating for you. For this exercise, we will say that your home is valued at 150,000 (running total:  190,000). This is likely to involve even more speculating and estimating.  You will probably be surprised by the amount you get, as the average single renter in the U.S. usually has 20,000–30,000 in such personal property. One of the best tips to estimate the value of things in your home is to search the item on Google.com or Kijiji.com to see what the used item is selling for on the market.  This is a useful exercise not only for determining your net worth, but also for figuring out how much renter’s or homeowner’s insurance you should carry.  Having a detailed list of your possessions — including photos, if possible — will also come in handy if you ever need to file a claim. For insurance purposes, you probably want to determine the replacement value for your things — what it would cost to actually replace them.  For your net worth, however, you simply want to establish the market value — what someone would pay for them as is.  For instance, you might be able to sell your five-year-old TV for 100, but replacing it with a comparable new one might cost 250. We’ll pretend your household possessions add up to 25,000, for a running total of 215,000. Be careful not to double-count anything. For example, you have already estimated the value of your home, therefore, you need to make sure that anything that was part of your home value is also not added to your list of valuables in your home. Generally speaking, if it is not staying in your home when you sell it, you can add it your list of valuables in your home. Again, this involves some guesswork, but thankfully there are numerous resources for establishing the market value for automobiles.  The traditional “blue book” for car valuations is now more easily utilized online, along with many competing car valuation and/or car-buying sites. You can also ask a car dealer for an estimate; if he or she has any inkling that you may want to buy a car, a dealer will likely be happy to do this for you. For our sample running total, let’s add 25,000 for your car to make it 240,000. Remember if you own it, it is an asset. You may have some debt on that asset (like a car you borrowed money to own for example), but that debt will be subtracted later on in the net worth calculation. Don't forget to include the value of any business you may own for example, or any additional property (like a cottage).

Context: This week I shot my Interview with Claire Bridge. Myself and Riah travelled, I would say all the way out too Wheelers Hill, but it’s really not that far away, unless you live on the North side, which we both do. Riah and I carried our gear on two trains and 1 bus to get to Claire’s studio out in Wheelers Hill. I can see why Claire lives here as it’s a pretty beautiful place, it’s still suburban but there are trills, hills and birds everywhere, and for someone that’s passionate about the environment I can see why she lives here. Meeting Claire was awesome, after having spoken via phone or email for so long, it was nice to speak to her in person. The filming of the interview went extremely smoothly, I’d put this down to having planned out everything, such as all the questions I was going to ask prior to the interview. By this stage I had helped Riah film as well as Elise and it was noticeable how much smoother Riah’s interview went because she had pre-planned her questions. Rather than spending an hour asking various questions that you might not use anyway, it’s much more efficient to spend 20 minutes covering exactly what you want to cover. By this stage I’d also had practise setting up lights, doing sound and getting camera shots for people’s portraits so I already knew everything I wanted to shoot. Our setup was pretty simple, two large lights, one on Claire’s front right and one on Claire’s front left, two Canon EOS 60D DSLR’s at different positions (one straight on, one to the side), a Sony H2N handy recorder and a lapel mic. Everything ran super smoothly, we did the interview first then myself and Riah shot various things in Claire’s studio. Whilst shooting various things in Claire’s studio we also got a chance to both speak to her which was nice, discussing what it is like to be a woman in Melbourne’s art scene and finding out who some of her favourite artists were.

The word \\"Phubbing\\", which comes from \\"phone\\" and \\"snub\\", describes such behavior . With popularization of smart phones, we see a new \\"Phubbing\\" group everywhere in public places: in subway, restaurants, roads, people are checking the mobile phone, ignoring the people around completely. What is worrying us is that not only young people, but also the elderly and kids are getting addicted to Phubbing. On Dec 29th, a 28-year-old woman--a mother of two in Wenzhou, drowned after she fell into a river while looking at her mobile phone. A Pakistani man was killed on Dec 15th, 2015, after being hit by a fast moving train while trying to take a selfie  with it on the track. Last month, Justin, a college student was shot in subway in San Francisco, the U.S. The surveillance video showed that before Justin was killed, the killer pulled out the gun several times, and even wiped his nose with it. However, nobody noticed that. The surrounding passengers all focused on their cell phones. Phone is the tool for communication, but now it distances people and makes them separated from each other. Therefore, someone jokes \\"the furthest distance in the world is not the distance between life and death, but that you don't know I stand in front of you while you focus on the mobile.\\" Phubbing appears harmless; however, it does affect our life. 23-year-old Alex from Melbourne wrote in his blog: \\"I can no longer focus on what I am eating since I started twittering. My skill of food photography has improved very fast, while my interest in food drops a lot as a result.\\" The author gives several examples in Para.2 to  _  . A) show the phubbing people are dangerous. B) tell people the bad effects of phubbing C) say phubbing is more and more popular. D) warn people not to use phones any more. A:","output":"The author gives several examples in Para.2 to B) tell people the bad effects of phubbing. Phubbing, as the combination of \\"phone\\" and \\"snub\\", has become an increasingly widespread phenomenon with the widespread use of smartphones. People of all ages, including the young, elderly, and children, are more engrossed in their phones than paying attention to their surroundings or engaging in face-to-face conversations. This behavior has led to numerous negative effects, as demonstrated by the examples in Paragraph 2. The first example mentions a 28-year-old woman who drowned after falling into a river while looking at her mobile phone, highlighting the potential physical dangers of phubbing and being oblivious to one's environment. The second example involves a Pakistani man who was hit by a train while trying to take a selfie on the track, emphasizing the potential consequences of prioritizing phone usage over personal safety. The third example recounts an incident where a college student was shot in the subway, and none of the surrounding passengers noticed the gunman due to their preoccupation with their phones. This illustrates how phubbing can make individuals more vulnerable to danger and less aware of potential threats. Apart from the physical dangers, the author also highlights the impact of phubbing on people's emotional well-being and personal interests. The 23-year-old Alex from Melbourne mentions in his blog that he can no longer focus on his food since he started using Twitter. Consequently, his interest in the actual food has diminished. This example shows how phubbing can affect interpersonal relationships and even personal interests, undermining individual connections and experiences. Therefore, the examples in paragraph 2 are meant to shed light on the various negative effects of phubbing, stressing the need to be aware of its potential consequences and encouraging people to reconsider how they engage with their smartphones in public spaces and during interpersonal interactions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Anatomy Lesson A Natural and Cultural History ''I FEAR,'' Nietzsche writes, ''that the animals regard man as a creature of their own kind which has in a highly dangerous fashion lost its healthy animal reason -- as the mad animal, as the laughing animal, as the weeping animal, as the unhappy animal.'' He might have added: as the belted animal. When dogs, cats or tigers burning in the jungle look upon us, surely what strikes them most forcibly is not that we walk upright, or even that we wear clothes, but that with few exceptions we are all cinctured at the waist, if only by the elastic in our drawers. This state of beltedness is one of the few oddities of the human condition that Michael Sims does not address in his compendious history of the body. Making a leisurely descent down the human frame from top to toe, he ignores the waist, although, as one would expect from the title of his book, he does pause long enough in the general vicinity to carry out an in-depth investigation of the bellybutton. Yes, there is lint here. Indeed, Karl Kruszelnicki, a professor of physics at the University of Sydney, is called upon to solve for us the ancient mystery of how so much fluff gets into the navel. According to this savant, it seems that ''abdominal hairs serve as a conveyor belt for transporting fibers upward from underwear'' and depositing them in the umbilicus. Yes, there are big words here, too. Sims is a journalist from Nashville who writes about cultural and scientific matters, and the author of ''Darwin's Orchestra: An Almanac of Nature in History and the Arts.'' Like many of the body parts that come under his scrutiny in ''Adam's Navel,'' he is a hangover from another age, yet well adapted to his own time. He has the breadth, if not the depth, of Montaigne or Robert Burton or Sir Thomas Browne, the whimsical omnivorousness of the 18th-century essayists, and he is as bigheartedly inclusive as Samuel Johnson, one of his particular heroes. The topics he considers range from the workings of the eye to Barbie's breasts, from the snake-hair of Medusa to ''The Vagina Monologues,'' from wet nurses to the ash from volcanoes in the Serengeti Plain, in which were preserved the 3.6-million-year-old bipedal prints of some of our earliest-known ancestors, Australopithecus afarensis. Nothing is too large or too small to merit Sims's attention, and nothing human disgusts him. He quotes from a medical text by Frederic Wood Jones treating of, among other podal matters, the hallux -- ''the technical term for the innermost digit on the hind limb of pentadactyl creatures'' -- in which the English anatomist bemoans the fact that ''the big toe lacks its champion.'' Not anymore. Sims describes ''Adam's Navel'' as ''something of a hybrid,'' which is something of an understatement. (Entering into the Simsian spirit, I cannot forbear to note the source of the word ''hybrid'' according to Chambers Dictionary: ''L. hybrida, offspring of a tame sow and wild boar.'') The book had its source in an accident that damaged one of Sims's cervical disks, leading to a diskectomy that forced him to lie immobile on his back for two weeks. In an understandably concentrated state of mind during this period of forced inactivity, he brooded much on the human body. Finding that he could balance a legal pad flat on his chest and write blind on it, afterward lifting the pad horizontal and deciphering the scribbles, he ''whiled away the hours scrawling free association under such headings as 'Ears' and 'Navel' and 'Toes,' '' and soon realized that his next book was under way. He decided from the start to concentrate on the outward form of the body, summoning to his support Oscar Wilde at his pithiest: ''The great mystery of the world is not the invisible, but the visible.'' Inner organs, therefore, are left to their dark and desperate business, while most of the outer body, from the hair, on head and elsewhere, to the hitherto unchampioned toes, is lovingly examined. True, Sims does make an occasional internal foray, into ears, mouth, nasal and other, nether, passages. He devotes a lively discussion to the first man's navel and how he might have acquired it, since he was not of woman born. He has some cheap but enjoyable fun at the expense of poor old Philip Henry Gosse, a zoologist who in 1857, two years before the publication of Darwin's ''Origin of Species,'' committed a work entitled ''Omphalos: An Attempt to Untie the Geological Knot,'' in which he sought to counter evolutionary arguments by suggesting that the wily Lord created the world complete with such things as fossils in cliffs, rings in tree trunks and a navel in Adam's belly. Gosse's more famous son, Edmund, author of the progenitor-slaying ''Father and Son,'' said witheringly of ''Omphalos'' that his father ''offered it, with a glowing gesture, to atheists and Christians alike. . . . But, alas! atheists and Christians alike looked at it and laughed, and threw it away.'' BEFORE leaving navels, one cannot resist informing Sims, if he does not know it already, that Salvador Dalí, a closet coprophagist -- but then, what other kind could there be? -- prized, above all of his wife Gala's waste products, tiny particles of dirt that he delighted in extracting from the deepest folds of her bellybutton, and that he was convinced were not deposits from without, drawn upward, as Kruszelnicki teaches, by the delicate action of her stomach floss, but -- and one hopes this review is not being read at the breakfast table -- solidifications of a microscopic seepage from within. Brings a new resonance to the phrase ''consuming passion.'' This is an entertaining, witty and erudite jackdaw's nest of a book. Sims seems not only to have read everything, the trivial as well as the lofty, but to have remembered all of it. The range of reference is dizzying. If at times he sounds like the worst bore in the bar, he will quickly re-grab the reader's flagging attention with some new bizarre fact or fragment of arcana. He notes, for instance, that Dr. Johnson refused to name the private parts in his dictionary, an irony, given that ''johnson'' is now a widely accepted nickname for the penis, which in turn, as Sims's section heading on the subject acknowledges, gives a ribald extension to the notion of ''Boswell's Johnson'' that would have made the great man's randy biographer chuckle. ''Adam's Navel'' is packed with such fluff.

Answer the following question: The New York Times announced Wednesday that it intended to charge frequent readers for access to its website, a step being debated across the industry that nearly every major newspaper has so far feared to take. Starting in early 2011, visitors to NYTimes.com will get a certain number of articles free every month before being asked to pay a standard and fixed fee for unlimited access. Subscribers to the newspaper's print edition will receive full access to the site. But executives of The New York Times Company said they could not yet answer fundamental questions about the plan, like how much it would cost or what the limit would be on free reading. They stressed that the amount of free access could change with time, in response to economic conditions and reader demand. Still, publishers fear that money from digital subscriptions would not make up for the resulting loss of audience and advertising income. NYTimes.com is by far the most popular newspaper site in the country, with more than 17 million readers a month in the United States, according to Nielsen Online, and analysts say it is the leader in advertising income, as well. That may make it better positioned than other general-interest papers to charge--and also gives The Times more to lose if the move produces an opposed result. The Times Company has been studying the matter for almost a year, searching for common ground between pro-and-anti pay campaigns--a debate mirrored in dozens of media-watching blogs-- and the system will not go into effect until January 2011. Executives said they were not bothered by the possibility of absorbing barbs  for moving cautiously. \\"There's no prize for getting it quick,\\" said Janet L.

Question: who discovered the atom is mostly empty space?? Answer:","output":"The discovery that the atom is mostly empty space came as a result of ground-breaking experiments conducted in the early 20th century, particularly from Sir Ernest Rutherford's gold foil experiment. However, understanding the discovery of the atom's structure involves looking at the combined contributions of several scientists. 1. J.J. Thomson (1856-1940): In 1897, British physicist J.J. Thomson discovered the electron through his experiments on cathode rays. He proposed the \\"plum pudding\\" model of the atom, in which electrons were scattered throughout a diffuse, positively charged sphere. During this time, it was believed that the atom was a solid mass. 2. Ernest Rutherford (1871-1937): In 1909, New Zealand-born British physicist Ernest Rutherford, widely regarded as the father of nuclear physics, designed the gold foil experiment along with his colleagues Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden. The experiment involved directing alpha particles at a thin gold foil and observing their scattering through a zinc sulfide screen. Rutherford expected the alpha particles to pass through the gold foil with minor deviations in their path due to interactions with the positively charged \\"plum pudding\\" atoms. To his surprise, some alpha particles were deflected at large angles, with a few bouncing almost directly backward. 3. Interpretation and conclusion: Rutherford realized that these unexpected results could only be explained if the atom's positively charged mass and most of its mass were concentrated in a tiny central region, which he called the nucleus. This implied that the majority of the atom's volume was empty space, featuring only the electrons orbiting around the nucleus at a relatively large distance. Rutherford's nuclear model of the atom succeeded in explaining the gold foil experiment's results, and the concept that atoms are mostly empty space became widely accepted in the scientific community. In the years that followed, other scientists built upon Rutherford's work, leading to Niels Bohr's planetary model in 1913, which incorporated new concepts of quantized energy levels for electrons. In summary, the discovery that the atom is mostly empty space is primarily credited to Ernest Rutherford, whose gold foil experiment provided evidence that directly challenged the prevailing \\"plum pudding\\" model of the atom. Rutherford's work opened the door to our modern understanding of atomic structure and marked a significant milestone in the field of nuclear physics."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"Cleaning up spilled nail polish can be challenging, but with the right tools and approach, it can be accomplished efficiently and effectively. Here's a step-by-step guideline for cleaning up a nail polish spill on different surfaces. 1. Assess the situation: - Check the surface on which the nail polish has spilled. Different surfaces will require different cleaning methods. Common surfaces might include fabric, carpet, hardwood floors, and tiles. 2. Gather the necessary tools and materials: Depending on the surface, the following items may be required: - Acetone/nail polish remover (avoid using acetone on wood or fabrics that can be damaged by it) - Cotton balls, paper towels, or clean cloth - Microfiber cloth - Hydrogen peroxide (for carpet and fabric surfaces) - Rubbing alcohol (for wood surfaces) - Baking soda - Plastic putty knife - Warm water - Liquid dish soap - Gloves (to prevent direct contact with chemicals) 3. Cleaning nail polish on different surfaces: **Fabric:** - Start by blotting the excess nail polish using a cloth or a paper towel. Do not rub the spill, as it may spread and push the polish deeper into the fabric. - If the fabric is washable, soak it in cold water. Mix one teaspoon of liquid dish soap with warm water and soak the fabric for 15-20 minutes. - Gently dab the stained area using a cloth dipped in acetone, focusing on the outer edges of the spill. Remember to test the acetone on a hidden area of the fabric to ensure it won't cause discoloration.  - Rinse the fabric with cold water and, if the stain is still visible, repeat the acetone treatment. - When the stain is removed, wash the fabric as per the care instructions. **Carpet:** - Blot excess nail polish with a clean cloth or paper towel. Make sure not to rub the spill. - Carefully apply hydrogen peroxide to the affected area using a cotton ball, working from the perimeter of the stain towards the center. - Blot the area again with a clean cloth or paper towel to absorb the loosened nail polish. - Repeat the process until the stain is no longer visible. - Rinse the area with cold water and blot dry with a clean cloth or paper towel. **Hardwood floors:** - Put on gloves to protect your hands from chemicals. - Use a plastic putty knife to scrape away as much dried nail polish as possible without scratching the floor. - Apply a small amount of rubbing alcohol to a cloth, then gently rub the stain, working from the outside edges and moving inwards. If the stain is not coming off easily, make a paste of baking soda and water and apply it to the stain, allowing it to sit for a few minutes. - Wipe away the paste with a damp microfiber cloth and repeat the process as needed until the stain is gone. - Dry the area thoroughly with a clean, dry cloth. **Tiles:** - Promptly wipe away the excess nail polish with a paper towel or cloth to prevent it from seeping into tile grout. - Apply acetone to a cloth and gently rub the stained tile surface. - After the nail polish is removed, clean the area with warm water mixed with a few drops of dish soap. - Rinse with water and wipe dry with a clean cloth. 4. Final step for all surfaces: After the nail polish is removed, ensure that the area is clean and free of any residue. Allow the surface to air-dry completely before using it again. Remember to always store nail polish in a safe and secure location to prevent future spills."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The Easter Bunny is a popular choice for cards, although Australians have traded the bunny for a native bilby.","output":"Title: The Timeless Charm of Easter Symbols: A Journey Through the Ages Introduction Easter, a cherished holiday celebrated across the globe, holds a special place in the hearts of millions. Packed with sentiment and symbolism, this festive season is a living testimony to the rich traditions and customs that have shaped human civilization. One of the key elements of the Easter holiday is the exchange of greeting cards, often adorned with iconic symbols such as daffodils, chicks, rabbits, and more. In this article, we explore the fascinating history of these symbols, their evolution, and their significance in the celebration of this vibrant occasion. A Glimpse into the Past Dating back to the late 19th century, the tradition of sending Easter greeting cards was considered an important aspect of the cultural tapestry. The earliest examples of these cards, preserved carefully as treasures of time, showcase a remarkable preference for symbols that have become synonymous with Easter. Nature's Charms: Daffodils, Chicks, and Rabbits Since the very beginning, nature-based symbols have been a popular choice for Easter cards. Daffodils, with their beautiful, trumpet-shaped flowers in vivid hues of yellow, have always featured prominently. Their arrival coincides with the onset of spring, serving as a tangible reminder of new beginnings and the sweetness of renewed life. Chicks, with their tender, yellow feathers and delicate forms, are emblematic of fertility and new life. As integral icons of the Easter narrative, they complement the festivities beautifully. Rabbits, another prominent symbol, can be traced back to ancient rituals surrounding the worship of deities associated with fertility. With their prolific breeding habits, rabbits have emerged as enduring symbols of life and vitality. Over time, these cuddly creatures have evolved into the popular figure of the Easter Bunny, enthralling children and adults alike with tales of hidden eggs and gifts. Angelic Inspiration: Cherubs and Angels Some of the oldest Easter cards emphasize the spiritual significance of the holiday, focusing on traditional religious scenes. Featuring cherubs and angels, these timeless cards highlight the divine aspect of Easter, serving as an artful reminder of the miracle of resurrection. Rosy-cheeked and ethereal, these celestial beings gracefully deliver the Easter message, embodying the sacred essence of the holiday. The Easter Bunny Versus the Bilby Although the Easter Bunny remains a favorite subject for Easter cards worldwide, a nation-specific variation has emerged in Australia. Recognizing the environmental threat posed by rabbits to native fauna and flora, Australians have embraced the native bilby as their Easter symbol. The Easter Bilby has become an icon in its own right, replacing the rabbit on greeting cards and other cultural paraphernalia. This novel adaptation showcases both regional pride and ecological awareness, enriching the holiday experience in the land down under. Conclusion The enchanting symbols that grace Easter cards serve as a testament to the timelessness of this holiday. Whether we turn our eyes to the delicate daffodils, the endearing chicks, the spirited rabbits, or the divine cherubs and angels, these images encapsulate the essence of Easter. Over the years, these symbols have evolved to reflect various cultural and ecological sensitivities, such as the replacement of the Easter Bunny with the Bilby in Australia. As we come together to celebrate this festive season, let us allow these cherished symbols to remind us of the extraordinary history that lies at the heart of this holiday, as well as the values and virtues they represent."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

OPTIONS: A). Fill the spray bottle with distilled water. Spray your microfiber cloth (not the screen). Gently wipe the screen in a circular motion with the cloth until the screen is clean and dry.; B). Fill the spray bottle with distilled water. Spray your microfiber cloth (not the screen). Gently scrub the screen in a circular motion with the cloth until the screen is clean and dry.;","output":"The correct way to clean a flat screen TV is in option A:  Firstly, it’s important to know that you should only use a soft cloth when dealing with a flat screen TV, and the most preferable choice would be a microfiber cloth. This type of cloth is great for cleaning screens because its fibers have the capability to attract dust and absorb oils without scratching or leaving streaks on the delicate screen. The cloth should also be comfortable to hold and able to reach all corners of the screen easily. Secondly, to do the cleaning, you need to fill a spray bottle with distilled water. It's important to note that you should never spray any liquid directly onto your flat screen TV as this can cause damage. The liquid can drip down into the electronics and lead to malfunction. Also, distilled water is preferable to tap water because it doesn’t contain the minerals found in the latter, which could potentially damage the screen or leave residues. After filling the spray bottle with distilled water, then you spray the microfiber cloth, ensuring the cloth is damp but not soaking wet. This damp cloth is less likely to scratch the monitor and it can easily wipe away dust and dirt. Upon spraying the cloth, you will then gently wipe the screen in a circular motion. The circular motion helps to avoid streaks and can get rid of dust and smudges evenly. Sticking to gentle moves is crucial, as hard pressing and scrubbing can scratch or damage the screen. Continuously wipe gently until you see no more streaks, dust, or grime on the screen. Finally, you should ensure the screen is dry before you turn the TV on. If the cloth is not enough to dry the screen, use a dry area of the microfiber cloth to go over it. This method helps to prevent any moisture damage from occurring, which could affect the performance of your TV. Remember, do not use any kind of detergent or cleaning product to clean your flat screen TV unless it is specifically made for this purpose. Regular cleaning products may contain chemicals that are too harsh and could irreparably damage the screen. Also, make sure to unplug the TV while cleaning to prevent any accidents or short-outs due to incidental moisture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write highlights for this article: Republicans' chances of winning control of the Senate in Tuesday's midterm elections are now up to 95%, according to CNN's Pivit, an analysis that combines experts' projections with political watchers' predictions on key races. The jump was driven largely by a Des Moines Register poll over the weekend that put Republican Joni Ernst 7 percentage points ahead of Democrat Bruce Braley in a Senate race seen as a must-win for Democrats. In that race, Pivit puts Ernst's chances at 88%. Pivit also offers bad news for Democratic Sen. Mark Udall in Colorado, whose chances are at just 6%, and Sen. Mark Pryor in Arkansas, who's down to 2%. Pivit's analysis suggests Democrats are in better shape in North Carolina, where Sen. Kay Hagan has a 69% chance of holding off Republican challenger Thom Tillis, and in New Hampshire, where Sen. Jeanne Shaheen's chances of beating Scott Brown are up to 81%. Republicans, meanwhile, look to have put Kentucky's Senate race out of reach. Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell's chances of surviving a challenge from Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes are up to 97%. Republicans need a net gain of six seats to capture a majority. Pick-ups in Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia are all but assured, and Democratic incumbents are facing uphill battles in Alaska, Arkansas and Louisiana, as well. Republicans are also hoping for wins in states like Colorado, Iowa, New Hampshire and North Carolina -- which would help solidify their chances of gaining a majority by providing insulation in case the GOP loses seats of its own in Georgia and Kansas.

In August 1993, they debuted as the tag team Harlem Heat, with Booker renamed Kole and Lash renamed Kane. They became heels and were on Harley Race and Col. Rob Parker's team in the WarGames match at Fall Brawl on September 19 against Sting, Davey Boy Smith, Dustin Rhodes, and The Shockmaster. They lost the match but were over as heels because of the caliber of faces they wrestled.  In 1994, they acquired the services of Sensational Sherri, dubbed 'Sister' Sherri, as their manager and changed their names back to Booker T and Stevie Ray, at their request. By the end of 1994, they held the WCW Tag Team Championship after defeating Stars and Stripes (The Patriot and Marcus Alexander Bagwell) in December. After dropping the title to The Nasty Boys, Harlem Heat regained the belts on June 24, 1995.  Afterward, Harlem Heat got into a feud with Col. Parker's \\"Stud Stable\\" of \\"Dirty\\" Dick Slater and Bunkhouse Buck. Parker and Sherri were carrying on a love affair and Parker eventually left the Stud Stable in favor of the Heat to be with Sherri. Harlem Heat won the WCW World Tag Team titles at Fall Brawl 1995, defeating Dick Slater and Bunkhouse Buck. Their third title reign only lasted one day, but the duo regained the tag team title nine days later from The American Males (Buff Bagwell and Scotty Riggs).

Given the question: As his days in office wane, U.S. President Barack Obama is pushing to commute sentences of non-violent drug offenders convicted under what the White House called \\"outdated and unduly harsh\\" sentencing laws. It has become the centerpiece of his effort to reform the country’s criminal-justice system, which has the highest incarceration rate in the world. Last Friday, the President granted commutations to 42 convicted nonviolent offenders, bringing the total so far in his presidency to 348 commutations — more than any president has in nearly half a century. His predecessor, George W. Bush granted clemency in just 11 cases. It's not just Obama pushing for reform. Top Republicans and Democrats in Congress also support relaxing the sentencing laws that have tripled the federal and state prison populations in the last 30 years, reaching more than 1.56 million inmates at the end of 2014. However in Congress, the main legislative effort for sentencing changes, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, has failed to pass either chamber of Congress. The bill would reduce long mandatory minimum sentences for many nonviolent drug crimes, give judges more control over the terms of punishment and provide inmates with more opportunities to get out early by participating in rehabilitation programs. Failing congressional help, Obama has in recent months relied on his presidential powers to commute the sentences of non-violent offenders. Under the Constitution, the president has the power to grant “pardons for offenses against the United States” or to commute federal sentences. A pardon is an act of presidential forgiveness and wipes away any remaining legal liabilities from a conviction. A commutation reduces a sentence but does not eliminate a conviction or restore civil rights lost as a result of the conviction. The American Bar Association has joined Obama's push and put its support behind the Clemency Project 2014, a national effort by multiple justice groups to help inmates who meet U.S. Department of Justice...

The anime originally aired between February and July 2008 on AT-X, and was later licensed in North America by Funimation Entertainment. \\"Would 'There are large time gaps in the internal chronology between the first five episodes, ranging from one to thirty years.' be a reasonable answer?\\"  Yes, indeed, your statement is quite fitting. The distinctive structure of the series contributes to its uniqueness, with each episode self-contained yet interconnected. The narrative technique used in the series is indeed characterized by substantial time lapses between episodes.  For instance, the timeframe between the first and second episode spans an entire decade. Likewise, the story places twenty years between the third and second episodes. Each episode stands on its own individual lapse in time, hence moving the story forward progressively into the future. What's more fascinating is each episode in the first five deals with different aspects of Rin's existence, her clients, her encounters, and her relationships, which unfold over time. The final episode departs from this usual storytelling style and revisits past events by providing additional details and insights into Rin’s fascinating life.  In conclusion, yes, stating there are substantial time gaps in the internal chronology between the first five episodes of \\"Mnemosyne: Mnemosyne no Musumetachi\\", ranging from one to thirty years, is an accurate and comprehensive summation of the show’s unique structure. This use of abrupt time jumps and the way the narrative plays out over these stretched time periods certainly adds a compelling edge to the overall presentation of the series."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In designating the al-Nusra Front as a foreign terrorist organization and an offshoot of al Qaeda in Iraq, the U.S. State Department has put flesh on the bones of its policy of discriminating between the \\"bad\\" Syrian rebels and the \\"good\\" ones. But the decision is getting mixed reviews in Syria. Rebels in brigades fighting around Aleppo have told CNN that the move is a miscalculation. Their argument goes something like this: \\"The U.S. and the West in general have given us next to no help while we've witnessed thousands die at the hands of Bashar al-Assad's heavy weaponry and dominance of the skies. \\"Al-Nusra Front is one of many groups that are fighting the OPTIONS: - Al-Nusra regime now, it is not the only one,\\" a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday in explaining the designation. - Aleppo regime now, it is not the only one,\\" a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday in explaining the designation. - Bashar al-Assad regime now, it is not the only one,\\" a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday in explaining the designation. - CNN regime now, it is not the only one,\\" a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday in explaining the designation. - Iraq regime now, it is not the only one,\\" a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday in explaining the designation. - Islamic regime now, it is not the only one,\\" a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday in explaining the designation. - Syria regime now, it is not the only one,\\" a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday in explaining the designation. - Syrian regime now, it is not the only one,\\" a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday in explaining the designation. - U.S. regime now, it is not the only one,\\" a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday in explaining the designation. - U.S. State Department regime now, it is not the only one,\\" a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday in explaining the designation. - West regime now, it is not the only one,\\" a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday in explaining the designation. - al Qaeda regime now, it is not the only one,\\" a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday in explaining the designation. - al-Nusra regime now, it is not the only one,\\" a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday in explaining the designation. - al-Nusra Front regime now, it is not the only one,\\" a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday in explaining the designation. - post-Assad Syria regime now, it is not the only one,\\" a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday in explaining the designation.","output":"Bashar al-Assad regime now, it is not the only one,\\" a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday in explaining the designation. The US State Department's designation has raised concerns for a number of reasons, particularly as it comes at a crucial moment in the ongoing conflict. By choosing to label the al-Nusra Front as a terrorist organization, the US has sent a strong message to other groups within the Syrian opposition: that they must distance themselves from extremist factions if they want to continue receiving international support. However, many Syrian rebels argue that the designation is counterproductive. They believe that the move could potentially fracture the fragile alliance between various rebel forces, making it more difficult for them to cooperate and coordinate their efforts against the government of Bashar al-Assad. Moreover, they argue that the al-Nusra Front has been instrumental in the fight against the Assad regime thus far, and that its members' extreme views do not necessarily represent the majority of the opposition. The mixed reactions to the designation highlight the complexities of the Syrian conflict and the delicate balance of power among the various rebel factions. The policy of differentiating between \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" rebels is a difficult one for the US and other Western nations as they strive to support the opposition while minimizing the risk of inadvertently aiding extremist groups with potential ties to terrorist organizations such as al Qaeda. In the coming weeks and months, the impact of the al-Nusra Front's designation on the conflict in Syria will become clearer. It is possible that some rebel factions may choose to distance themselves from the extremist group, working more closely with the US and other Western nations in their pursuit of regime change. However, if the designation serves to alienate the al-Nusra Front and fracture the opposition further, it could ultimately lead to increased fighting and instability within the region. In conclusion, the most logical completion of the news story indicates that while the US State Department has aimed to differentiate between the \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" rebels by designating the al-Nusra Front as a terrorist organization, the consequences of this decision remain uncertain. Although the move might encourage other rebel factions to disassociate themselves from extremist elements and strengthen their ties with the West, it could also potentially undermine the unity of the Syrian opposition, making it even more difficult to achieve a resolution to the conflict."},{"instruction":"Teacher:This task involves creating questions from a given passage that involve some kind of complex reasoning (including numerical reasoning).

The region became a British protectorate in 1891  and in 1907, was named Nyasaland. Unlike many other parts of Africa, where British rule was dependent on the support of local factions, in Nyasaland British control rested on military superiority. During the 1890s the colonial authorities put down numerous rebellions by the local Yao, Ngoni and Cewa peoples. British rule in Nyasaland radically altered the local indigenous power structures. The early colonial period saw some immigration and settlement by white colonists, who bought large swathes of territory from local chiefs, often for token payments in beads or guns. Most of the land acquired, particularly in the Shire Highlands, was converted into white-owned plantations where tea, coffee, cotton and tobacco were grown. The enforcement of colonial institutions, such as the Hut Tax, compelled many indigenous people to find paid work and the demand for labour created by the plantations, led to their becoming a major employer. Once employed on the plantations, black workers found that they were frequently beaten and subject to racial discrimination. Increasingly, the plantations were also forced to rely on a system of forced labour or corvée, known locally at the thangata. Student:","output":"1.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. There are no reasons of taking this documentary serious and there are four reasons for that:  1) The people who made this documentary (including the director and the producer) are Serbs or of Serbian origin, therefore the criteria of neutrality fails. For instance, they mentioned that the diaspora Croats (the so called \\"Ustase\\") played a huge part in the fall of Yugoslavia, but they didn't mention that there were equal Serbian organizations as well (Cetniks)! For you who aren't that familiar with Balkan WW2 history: The Serbian so called \\"Cetniks\\" that were portrayed in the documentary as being so kind that they helped British paratroops during the war. Well, that's only half the truth. They were also a fascist (Monarch) group who collaborated with the Germans, but then switched side when Hitler started losing the war. It's also ironic that they don't mention the Cetnik leader Mihajlovic in the documentary, a man that is responsible for killing thousands of people and burning hundreds of villages all over Bosnia and Croatia. But they mentioned a certain Ante Pavelic...Hm...Allow me to be just a little suspicious. 2) Most of the people interviewed are to me totally unknown. And I've studied this war for a long time (who is the old British lady!!! She really hasn't made her homework!) and they are not even presented by name, so they could More or less be anybody, maybe someone they took from the street. Who knows. 3) In The documentary they talk about Kosovo and how the Serbs have lived there for ages, and therefore it should belong to Serbia (even though they are a minority). Well, when they mention the Serbian dominated part of Croatia (Krajina) suddenly the Serbs are portrayed as how they have the right to live there because it has been their home for so long. Fine, but what people don't know is that the largest city in Krajina (Knin) has great historical importance for the Croatian people. It was there where one of the most celebrated Kings of Croatian history (Zvonimir) was crowned, and therefore the city has a historical value for Croatia. The Serbs arrived almost 800 years or so later! But no, the Serbs should have Krajina and Kosovo according to the documentary. Is that fair? To me it looks like double standards of morality from the director. Plus, it is said in the documentary that the Croatian constitution didn't have any laws about minority rights, this is a lie because it was one of the first laws implemented BECAUSE of the fact that Croatia had a huge Serbian minority. 4) The film mentions a radical Croatian Paramilitarian leader called Glavas. Or the Muslim radical Oric. They accused them of being a huge reason for the negative development of the war. Yes, they were radicals, but if you want to talk about radicals, why not also mention the Serbian radical paramilitary leaders such as Seselj and Arkan? The flaws are so many that I just presented a few of them, just so that people get an overview of the documentary. It looks like the people who made this documentary weren't well prepared and didn't have the guts to criticize the Serbs because they were afraid that their Serbian relatives would slap them or something. There aren't that many documentaries out there that are of good quality, but the best so far is \\"The death of Yugoslavia\\" where all the significant participants of the war are interviewed (e.g. Milosevic, Jovic, Bulatovic, Tudman, Izetbegovic, Karadzic etc.) and where you get a whole 5 hour explanation about the fall of Yugoslavia and the war. One other thing. I saw a comment on this documentary where the person was frustrated about why the US gave support to a country (Bosnia) that had connections with Bin Laden during the war. Well, first of all, all the countries involved in this conflict had nationalist presidents and because the Bosnian Muslims didn't have an old ethnic identity (previosly they were called \\"Muslim Croats\\") they had to rely on something else besides nationality to raise the spirit among the people, and that was by connecting them to the only thing that they had in common: Their religion. And they took help from the Mujahedin because no one else would support them. They had to fight the 4:th largest army in Europe! They needed all the help they could get.

The oldest daughter Jelena, already married in northeastern Upper Hungary, survived and continued the resistance. Some 2,000 other nobles were arrested as part of a mass crackdown.  Two more leading conspirators — Ferenc Nádasdy, Chief Justice of Hungary, and Styrian governor, Count Hans Erasmus von Tattenbach — were executed .

Mountain bikes share similarities with other bikes, but incorporate features designed to enhance durability and performance in rough terrain. These typically include suspension on the frame and fork, large knobby tires, more durable heavy duty wheels, more powerful brakes, and lower gear ratios needed for steep grades with poor traction.  - Downhill is an alpine skiing discipline. Unlike the other alpine skiing events, slalom, giant slalom, super giant slalom, and combined, which emphasize turning and technique, downhill is more about speed. Speeds of up to are common in international competition. Athletes must have an aerodynamically efficient tuck position to minimize drag and increase speed.  - Cycle sport is competitive physical activity using bicycles. There are several categories of bicycle racing including road bicycle racing, time trialling, cyclo-cross, mountain bike racing, track cycling, BMX, and cycle speedway. Non-racing cycling sports include artistic cycling, cycle polo, freestyle BMX and mountain bike trials. The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) is the world governing body for cycling and international competitive cycling events. The International Human Powered Vehicle Association is the governing body for human-powered vehicles that imposes far fewer restrictions on their design than does the UCI.

It is characterized by the requirement for mechanical assistance getting to the top of the hill, since the equipment does not allow efficient walking or hiking, unlike cross-country skis which use free-heel bindings. It is typically practiced at ski resorts which provide services such as ski lifts, artificial snow making and grooming, first aid, and restaurants. Back-country skiers use alpine skiing equipment to ski off the marked pistes, in some cases with the assistance of snowmobiles, helicopters or snowcats. Alpine skiing has been an event at the Winter Olympic Games since 1936 (except for the 1940 games).  - The Union Cycliste Internationale, commonly known by the acronym UCI, is the world governing body for sports cycling and oversees international competitive cycling events.

Step 1: Research and fact-check the statement - Tennessee was admitted to the Union as the 16th state on June 1, 1796: This statement is true. Step 2: Explain the process of Tennessee becoming a state 1. Territorial formation: In 1784, settlers in western North Carolina (now eastern Tennessee) formed the State of Franklin in an attempt to gain independence. However, the State of Franklin was not recognized by the U.S. government, and it failed in 1789. 2. Southwest Territory: In 1790, North Carolina ceded its western lands to the federal government, leading to the formation of the Southwest Territory, which included present-day Tennessee. 3. Territorial growth and development: Under the leadership of Governor William Blount, the Southwest Territory experienced significant population growth and development. The new settlers drafted a constitution and petitioned for statehood. 4. Request for statehood: In 1795, a territorial census revealed a population of over 60,000 free residents, which met the requirement of the Northwest Ordinance for statehood. 5. Creation of a state constitution: In January 1796, a convention was held in Knoxville to draft a state constitution. This constitution was completed in February 1796. 6. Admission to the Union: On June 1, 1796, Tennessee was admitted to the Union as the 16th state. To summarize: Tennessee became a state after the region experienced significant growth and development under the Southwest Territory administration. When the required population was met, a constitution was drafted and submitted to the U.S. government, leading to the admission of Tennessee as the 16th state on June 1, 1796."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The body of Laura was stronger than Jennifer because  Select from:  *Laura was a bodybuilder by profession..  *Jennifer was a bodybuilder by profession..","output":"The body of Laura was stronger than Jennifer because Laura was a bodybuilder by profession.  As a bodybuilder, Laura committed to a disciplined, rigorous lifestyle that aimed at maximizing her muscular strength and size. This process involved a combination of intense resistance training, carefully calibrated nutrition, and adequate rest to facilitate muscle growth and recovery. Her profession thus placed her in an optimal position to outperform Jennifer in terms of physical strength. Laura's resistance training consisted of various exercises targeting different muscle groups through a process known as periodization. By strategically varying her routine, she was able to work on specific muscles at different times and give other muscles adequate time to recover. This approach allowed Laura to stimulate muscle growth consistently while minimizing the risk of overtraining and injury. When it came to nutrition, Laura followed a well-crafted diet plan that provided her with all the macronutrients and micronutrients her body needed to build muscle and maintain overall good health. Her diet was high in protein, moderate in carbohydrates, and low in fat to promote muscle synthesis and provide the necessary energy for her training sessions. Moreover, she also consumed various supplements, such as protein powders, creatine, and branched-chain amino acids, to support her training goals. In addition to exercise and nutrition, an important factor in Laura's success was allowing her body enough time to recover. During sleep, the body produces hormones like growth hormone and testosterone, which facilitate muscle growth. Laura ensured a consistent sleeping schedule to maximize muscle recovery and come back stronger in her next workout routine. On the other hand, Jennifer, who was not a professional bodybuilder, might have engaged in some form of physical activity, but her training and nutrition were likely not at the same level as Laura's. Since Jennifer's primary focus was not on achieving maximum muscle hypertrophy and strength, her musculature and overall strength would be less developed than Laura's. In conclusion, the sentence ends with \\"Laura was a bodybuilder by profession.\\" Laura's dedication to her profession, coupled with her intensive training, disciplined nutrition, and recovery routine, played a vital role in forging her superior physical strength compared to Jennifer."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It's a great album, but it is a bit overrated by everybody. Though if you are a real Maiden fan and you don't have Number Of The Beast in your collection, what are you waiting for? The music is loud and heavy, reminds you of the good days of heavy metal. Answer:","output":"The given review appears to have both positive and negative aspects that could influence my decision to purchase the product, which in this case is Iron Maiden's \\"Number Of The Beast\\" album. However, by analyzing the review in more detail, I can determine whether it would increase or decrease my chances of buying the album. Positive Aspects: 1. Number one album: The fact that this is Iron Maiden's first number one album already increases its appeal and shows that it was well-received by fans and critics alike. 2. Great album: The reviewer explicitly mentions that it is a great album, which indicates that the content is of high quality. 3. For real fans: The reviewer emphasizes that this album is a must-have for genuine Iron Maiden fans, suggesting that it is a vital addition to their collection. 4. Music style: The description of the music as loud, heavy, and reminiscent of the good days of heavy metal would appeal to those who appreciate that style and genre of music. Negative Aspects: 1. Overrated: Despite the positive feedback, the reviewer mentions that the album is a bit overrated by everybody. This could imply that perhaps the album's hype and success might be disproportionate to its actual quality. 2. Ambiguous recommendation: The use of the word \\"bit\\" when describing the album's overrated status leaves room for interpretation. It can be seen as a minor flaw or as a red flag that might cause potential buyers to reconsider. Considering both the positive and negative aspects of the review, there is an overall positive tone. However, I would say that the review's impact on my decision to purchase the album would depend on my personal preferences as well as how strongly I weigh the importance of the overrated aspect. If I am an avid Iron Maiden fan or a fan of heavy metal music in general, this review would likely increase my chances of buying the product. In this case, the positive aspects may outweigh the concern about the album being overrated, as I would be more focused on completing my collection or enjoying the loud, heavy music described in the review. On the other hand, if I am a more casual fan or have diverse music tastes, the review might decrease my chances of buying the album. The fact that it is overrated could make me hesitant to invest in a product that might not live up to its hype. In conclusion, the impact of this review on the chances of buying the product would largely depend on the individual's music preferences and how they value the potential drawbacks of the album being overrated. The review presents a balanced perspective, highlighting the album's impressive achievement as a number one product and its significance for true Iron Maiden fans while also acknowledging the potential concerns about its universal acclaim. Therefore, the decision to buy the album would ultimately be influenced by the potential buyer's priorities and musical inclinations."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Article: It's Sunday.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What are the major habitats of the location that lies at the southern edge of Lancashire Plain?, using the article: At 53°27′46″N 2°25′54″W (53.4629, -2.4316), Chat Moss lies at the southern edge of the Lancashire Plain, an area of Bunter sandstones overlaid with marls laid down during the Late Triassic period. Those rocks are themselves overlaid by a layer of boulder clay deposited during the last ice age, about 10,000 years ago. The combination of the flat topography and the underlying clay resulted in extensive peat bogs developing along the Mersey Valley, and overflowing beyond the valley. The bogs in the area between the River Glaze in the west, and Worsley and Eccles in the east, to the north of what was the River Irwell – now the Manchester Ship Canal – are known collectively as Chat Moss. Chat Moss is a lowland raised bog. In areas where drainage is poor, water-logging can slow down plant decomposition, producing peat, which over the years can raise the level of the bog above that of the surrounding land. The moss occupies an area of about 10.6 square miles (27.5 km2), and is about 5 miles (8 km) long, about 2.5 miles (4.0 km) across at its widest point, lying 75 feet (23 m) above sea level. Chat Moss lies mainly in Salford, but extends into Wigan. By the 1990s, an estimated 72 per cent of the bog had been reclaimed, most of it for agriculture. About 230 acres (93 ha) of degraded bog remain, with 766 acres (310 ha) of undamaged peat deposits in four former peat extraction sites. The peat varies in depth between 24 feet (7 m) and 30 feet (9 m).The main bog mosses found in the peat of Chat Moss are Sphagnum cuspidatum, S. imbricatum, and S. acutifolia. The peat up to about 7 feet (2 m) from the surface is mainly humidified S. acutifolia, with fresher S. imbricatum peat nearer the surface.A 228-acre (92 ha) area of Chat Moss, to the north of the Liverpool–Manchester railway line, notified as Astley & Bedford Mosses, was designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1989.

The answer to this question is:","output":"The major habitats of the location lying at the southern edge of Lancashire Plain, as described, are mainly peat bogs, particularly Chat Moss. Chat Moss is a large area of peat bog that occupies about 10.6 square miles (27.5 km2). It lies 75 feet (23 m) above sea level and is mainly located in Salford with an extension into Wigan. Chat Moss is categorised as a lowland raised bog, which typically forms due to the accumulation of peat, a substance produced when plant material, in marshes or damp regions, decomposes.  The formation of these peat bogs is a result of a combinative effect of the flat topography of the region and the underlying layer of boulder clay that results in poor drainage, thus creating conditions favourable for water-logging. This results in slower plant decomposition and consequently produces peat. Over the years, the accumulation of peat raises the level of the bog, setting it above that of the surrounding land. Chat Moss extends between the River Glaze in the west, and Worsley and Eccles in the east, to the north of the location of the former River Irwell, now the Manchester Ship Canal. By the 1990s, around 72% of Chat Moss had been reclaimed, predominantly for agriculture. However, there still remains about 230 acres (93 ha) of degraded bog, along with about 766 acres (310 ha) of undamaged peat deposits in four former peat extraction sites. The depth of the peat varies, ranging from 24 feet (7 m) to 30 feet (9 m).

Itâs at a bereavement therapy group that meets on the Southwest Side of Chicago  far from her North Shore home  where  Tina Nelson  has found some measure of comfort and validation as  she  copes with  her  sonâs sudden and violent death.  Grant Nelson  was killed in May while driving for ride-share company Uber. A 16-year-old Chicago girl is accused of attacking him with a knife and a machete that authorities say she had just stolen from a Walmart in Skokie. Since July   Tina Nelson  has been attending a support group for crime victimsâ families thatâs held each month at the Leighton Criminal Court Building in Chicago.  Tina Nelson  had experienced other losses in recent years. A sister-in-law died unexpectedly of a brain aneurysm. And just a month before Grant  another sister-in-law lost a âtorturous battle with cancer.â But her sonâs death is âa different sphere of experience â  Tina Nelson  said. âYou have to reconcile the fact that someone chose to take the life of your loved one â said  Tina âs daughter Alex Nelson  who also has been attending the bereavement group. âIt is not a freak accident or illness. Itâs that someone made a conscious choice  and that adds to the grieving process. You are not just mourning the person. You are trying to reconcile the feelings about (the accused)  whether it be forgiveness or anger.â  Tina  and Alex Nelson spoke with the Tribune on Dec. 4 â what would have been Grantâs 35th birthday â about how the family is coping.  Tina Nelson  describes how  she  finds  herself  daily longing to talk to  him   particularly to tell  him  things  she  knows  he âd find funny.  She  demonstrated how  he  would throw  his  head back when  he  laughed.  He  had âthe best laugh â  she  said. âI miss  his  laugh.â â It  has been a lifesaver for my husband and myself â she said. â It âs the camaraderie. You get to know people that walked in your shoes. And no one looks down at you.

The panelling was introduced to the room by the 3rd Earl Brownlow in 1876, when it was furnished as the principal dining room of the mansion. The room was initially created as a library in 1808 from the upper part of the earlier kitchen which had originally risen two stories. The West staircase (14) was originally a service stairs, and would have been plainer in decor, but by the late nineteenth century it was in regular use by the family.Either side of the Marble Hall, lie the Great Staircase (2) and the Tapestry Room (11), which contains a collection of early eighteenth century Mortlake tapestries. The Great Staircase to the east of the Marble Hall is unusually placed at Belton, as in a house of this period one would expect to find the staircase in the hall. The stairs rise in three flights around the west, north, and east walls to the former Great Dining Room above the Marble Hall. Thus the staircase served as an important state procession link between the three principal reception rooms of the house. The Great Dining Room, now the Library, has been greatly altered and all traces of Carolean decoration removed, first by James Wyatt in 1778 when it was transformed into a drawing room with a vaulted ceiling, and again in 1876, when its use was again changed, this time to a library. The room contains some 6000 volumes, a superb example of book collecting over 350 years. When Lord Tyrconnel died in 1754 a catalogue of his library identified almost 2,300 books. Almost all of these remain in the Belton library today. Rupert Gunnis attributed the carved marble chimneypiece depicting two Roman goddesses to Sir Richard Westmacott.Leading from the Library is the Queen's Room, the former \\"Best Bed Chamber\\". This panelled room was redecorated in 1841 for the visit...

You must generate a detailed and long answer. (CNN) -- Japan's prime minister conceded defeat in parliamentary elections Sunday, signaling the return to power of the Liberal Democratic Party and ending the brief rule of the disappointing upstart Democratic Party of Japan. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda pledged to step down as party president after exit polls showed a smashing loss in lower house voting. The party, once seen as a breath of fresh air in Japanese politics, came to be regarded as increasingly ineffective. \\"We got a regrettable result,\\" Noda said. \\"The result is everything in the politics. The biggest responsibility lies on me. I will quit as the partly leader of DPJ.\\" The move clears the way for the return to power of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the current leader of the conservative-leaning Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP. \\"The Japanese people will be keenly looking whether the LDP can meet with their expectations,\\" Abe said in interviews after the polling. The LDP ruled the country almost continuously since its establishment in 1955 until it was forced from power three years ago by the DPJ. Public broadcaster NHK said the LDP and its coalition partner, the new Komei party, gained at least 302 seats in the 480-seat lower house. CNN's main affiliate, TV Asahi, reports the LDP/Komei coalition gained at least 312 seats. The official count is expected to be released Monday. The LDP is inheriting a struggling economy, regional tensions and questions over Japan's role in Asia. \\"The economy is at the bottom. It's our first mission to turn it around,\\" Abe said.  Question: \\"What is the name of Japan's prime minister who conceded defeat in parlimentary elections?\\" Response: \\"Shinzo Abe\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","output":"The response to the question is factually incorrect based on the paragraph. The correct response should be \\"Yoshihiko Noda,\\" as he was the Japanese prime minister who conceded defeat in parliamentary elections. Shinzo Abe is the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party and former prime minister who returned to power after the defeat of Yoshihiko Noda."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: When early colonial settlers went to America, they took many forms of dance to _ . Square dancing, one of the oldest forms of American folk dancing, developed from several different Old World group dances, mainly English country dances, and the French quadrille . In the American version of square dancing, four couples form a square and dance to music. An American addition to square dancing is the caller. What do you think a caller does? The callers---someone who calls out the dance steps in time to the music--- was a completely American invention. At first dancers memorized all the steps for a particular dance, but eventually the dances became so complicated that it was necessary to have someone call out cues   so that dancers didn't have to remember so many steps. The caller didn't just call out \\"do-se-do your partner\\"; a good caller also came up with colorful sayings or witty lines that he said in between the cues such as \\"Don't be shy and don't be afraid. Swing on the corner in a waltz promenade  .\\" A caller might also come up with new dance steps and routines. Although popular for years, square dancing seemed to be going out of style and fading away until the early 1930s, when Henry Ford helped revive interest in it. Ford, the automobile manufacturer, used to vacation at the Wayside Inn in Massachusetts, where he enjoyed the dance programme run by a man named Benjamin Lovett. Ford asked Lovett to come to Detroit and teach dances, but Lovett said he couldn't because he had a contract with the inn. Ford solved that problem by buying the inn and Lovett's contract. He took Lovett back to Detroit, where together they established a programme for teaching squares and rounds. Square dancing was updated and groups began forming all over the country. Question: Why did the caller call out the steps for the dancers? - Because the dance was invented by the caller. - Because the dancers didn't know the names of the steps. - Because the steps were very particular. - Because it was hard for the dancers to remember all the steps. A:","output":"The reason the caller called out the steps for the dancers was because it was hard for the dancers to remember all the steps. As the square dance evolved over time in America, the dance steps became increasingly intricate and complicated. Dancers originally had to memorize all the steps for a particular dance, but with the addition of more complex routines, it became challenging to recall every step accurately. Consequently, the role of the caller was introduced. The caller was someone who would call out the dance steps in time to the music, providing cues for the dancers so they didn't have to remember so many steps. The presence of a caller administering instructions made the dance easier to follow and allowed dancers to enjoy the experience without the burden of memorizing a multitude of steps. The usage of catchy phrases and witty lines by the caller also added to the overall entertaining experience of square dancing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

France played a key role in the development of the Roman Catholic Church and the spread of Christianity across Europe. This relationship with the Church became especially evident during the Crusades, when France took the lead in the Christian campaigns against non-Christian nations and territories, particularly in the pursuit of gaining control over the Holy Land in Palestine. The term \\"eldest daughter of the Church\\" also highlights France's role in defending the Catholic faith over the centuries. France has had a long-standing tradition of supporting the Pope and the Catholic Church, particularly during times of religious conflict and political turmoil.

This would affect the oxygen exchange in the following ways: 1. Direct impact: The primary function of alveoli in the lungs is to facilitate the exchange of gases, specifically oxygen and carbon dioxide, between the air and our bloodstream. Oxygen is taken into the blood, while carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism, is removed. If carbon dioxide doesn't enter the alveoli, this gas exchange is disrupted, affecting the balance and efficiency of the process. 2. Indirect impact: When carbon dioxide does not get adequately removed, it can accumulate in the bloodstream, leading to a condition called hypercapnia or excessive carbon dioxide levels. High levels of carbon dioxide can lead to respiratory acidosis, which occurs when the blood becomes too acidic. This, in turn, impacts the body's ability to transport and release oxygen efficiently. Additionally, excessive carbon dioxide in the bloodstream may cause dilation of blood vessels, impairing the ability of the circulatory system to effectively deliver oxygen to cells and tissues. Overall, if carbon dioxide doesn't enter the alveoli, it directly disrupts the gas exchange process in the lungs, leading to indirect consequences that can negatively affect oxygen transport and availability to the body's cells and tissues."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In order to do this, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. Since 264 is being multiplied by x, we should divide both sides of the equation by 264. -3960 ÷ 264 = (264*x) ÷ 264 This simplifies to: -3960 ÷ 264 = x Step 3: Perform the calculations on the left side of the equation. -3960 ÷ 264 = -15  So now we have: x = -15 Therefore, the value of x that makes the equation true is x = -15."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In August 2016, the company applied for receivership.  - Terminology. The term \\"zaibatsu\\" was coined in 19th century Japan from the Sino-Japanese roots \\"zai\\" (\\"wealth\\", from Middle Chinese \\"dzoi\\") and \\"batsu\\" (\\"clique\\", \\"group\\", from MC \\"bjot\\"). Although \\"zaibatsu\\" themselves existed from the 19th century, the term was not in common use until after World War I. By definition, the \\"zaibatsu\\" were large family-controlled vertical monopolies consisting of a holding company on top, with a wholly owned banking subsidiary providing finance, and several industrial subsidiaries dominating specific sectors of a market, either solely, or through a number of subsubsidiary companies.  - South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a sovereign state in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula.  - Korea is a historical state in East Asia, since 1945 divided into two distinct sovereign states: North Korea (officially the \\"Democratic People's Republic of Korea\\") and South Korea (officially the \\"Republic of Korea\\"). Located on the Korean Peninsula, Korea is bordered by China to the northwest and Russia to the northeast. It is separated from Japan to the east by the Korea Strait and the East Sea.  - Korean National Airlines (KNA) was the first (commercial cargo and passenger) air carrier in Korea. Established in 1946 and incorporated in 1948 in South Korea, and its first official passenger flight was from Seoul to Pusan on October 30, 1948 (which is now Korea's National Air Day holiday). The carrier was an international carrierthough it was privately owned by its Founding Chairman, Captain Shin Yong-Wook []. It operated under the brand name Koreanair.  - In law, receivership is the situation in which an institution or enterprise is being held by a receiver, a person \\"placed in the custodial responsibility for the property of others, including tangible and intangible assets and rights\\", especially in cases where a company cannot meet its financial obligations or enters bankruptcy. The receivership remedy is an equitable remedy that emerged in the English Chancery courts, where receivers were appointed to protect real property. Receiverships are also a remedy of last resort in litigation involving the conduct of executive agencies that fail to comply with constitutional or statutory obligations to populations that rely on those agencies for their basic human rights.   - A chaebol (, ; from \\"chae\\" \\"wealth or property\\" + \\"bol\\" \\"faction or clan\\"  also written with the same Chinese characters  as Zaibatsu) is a South Korean form of business conglomerate. They are typically global multinationals and own numerous international enterprises, controlled by a chairman with power over all the operations. The term is often used in a context similar to that of the English word \\"conglomerate\\". The term was first used in 1984. There are several dozen large Korean family-controlled corporate groups which fall under this definition.    What is the relationship between 'hanjin' and 'seoul'? Answer:","output":"The relationship between 'Hanjin' and 'Seoul' is that Hanjin Group, a South Korean conglomerate (or Chaebol), is headquartered in Seoul, the capital and largest metropolis of South Korea. Hanjin Group is a holding company that includes companies like Hanjin Shipping and Korean Air. Seoul serves as the global headquarters for Korean Air, the largest airline and flag carrier of South Korea, which is a part of the Hanjin Group. Therefore, the connection between Hanjin and Seoul lies in the fact that Hanjin Group, along with its subsidiary companies, operates and maintains its headquarters in Seoul, South Korea."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the images huge mountains, deep trenches and dormant volcanoes are seen strewn across the search area - but there's no sign of the plane yet. The search for the plane is set to resume later this month, and mapping the ocean floor is essential to ensure the survival of underwater equipment that will be used. Three-dimensional models of the area MH370 is thought to have gone missing in the Indian Ocean have been revealed. They will be used to direct deep-sea equipment when the search for the plane resumes later this month. The maps reveal various features include large ridges and deep trenches (shown) Malaysia Airlines flight 370 disappeared over the Indian Ocean on 8 March with 239 people on board, and no sign of the plane has been found since then. It has been widely reported that better maps of Mars exist than this portion of the sea floor where the plane is thought to be located, so the new maps will be key in the hunt for the plane. The models show the designated MH370 search area, which includes the seabed around an area known as Broken Ridge. 8 March 12:21am. Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 departs from Kuala Lumpur, south west Malaysia, due to land in Beijing at 6.30am the same day. On board are 227 passengers and 12 crew. 1.20am. Eight villagers report seeing lights in the sky and hearing noise in the Marang area of north east Malaysia. 1.30am. Air traffic control makes its last recorded sighting of air traffic control. The plane is last seen on civilian radar above the waters where the South China Sea meets the Gulf of Thailand. 1.45am. Several sightings of the planet are reported, including a businessman in Kora Bharu and a bus driver in Penaruk. 2.15am. Military radar detects what could be the jetliner 200 miles north west of Penang Island in the Northern Malacca Strait. The primary search area - dubbed the ‘priority area' - is  an arc 23,000 square miles (60,000 square kilometres) in size, roughly the size of Croatia, 1,120 miles (1,800km) off the Australian coast. This area formed when two geological plates separated 20 to 100 million ago creating mountains, volcanoes and trenches. Seamounts - remnants of submarine volcanoes - are also present in the area. These large geological structures are typical of two such spreading plates. Structures include rugged ridges that reach heights of 985ft (300 metres) and trenches that are up to 4,590ft (1,400 metres) deep. At the end of this month the search will resume to try to find any sign of MH370 in this area. This will include using a deep-sea search vehicle attached to a boat by an armoured cable 6.2-miles (10km) long. Knowing where ridges and volcanoes lie is vital to ensure the equipment does not crash into an unseen object while underwater. The vehicle will use sonar to scan the ocean floor for anything that might resemble MH370, and it will also be able to detect the presence of aviation fuel. Knowing the location of the features is essential to steer deep-sea vehicles around them. Later this month equipment will be lowered on a cable to search the seabed using sonar and other techniques to try and find MH370. The maps  reveal raised areas (shown) that will need to be dodged by underwater vehicles. The primary search area - dubbed the ‘priority’ area - is an arc 23,000 square miles (60,000 square kilometres) in size, 1,120 miles (1,800km) off the Australian coast. This area was created when two geological plates separated 20 to 100 million ago, forming large mountains, volcanoes and trenches (shown) ‘The recently acquired high-resolution bathymetry data [the study of ocean floors] has revealed many of these seabed features for the first time,’ the Australian Transport Safety Bureau said in a statement. ‘It is also revealing finer-scale seabed features that were not visible in the previous low-resolution, satellite-derived bathymetry data.’ The new 3D models were maid using high resolution survey data, including satellite gravity measurements and some ocean passage soundings. Identification of the features will assist in navigation during the underwater search phase. The estimated location of MH370 in this area was derived from a series of brief pings - electronic ‘hellos’ - from the plane to a satellite before it disappeared. And it's hoped some sign of the plane will finally be found when the search starts again. The deep sea search vehicle will use sonar to scan the ocean floor for anything that might resemble MH370, and it will also be able to detect the presence of aviation fuel. Seamounts (shown) - remnants of submarine volcanoes - are also present in the area. Malaysia Airlines flight 370 disappeared without a trace in the early hours of 8 March while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The Boeing 777 with the registration number 9M-MRO is seen here on a previous flight over Poland on 5 February 2014 before its final flight. Highlights:","output":"1.

Today, we are going to learn how to make yummy potato and egg cutlets. Cutlets are small, yummy round-shaped foods that look like mini burgers. They are super fun to make and eat. So, let's get started! Ingredients you'll need: 1. Potatoes 2. Eggs 3. Breadcrumbs (those are tiny, dried pieces of bread that help make our cutlets crispy) 4. Oil (to cook our cutlets) Step 1: Wash, Peel, and Cook the Potatoes First, we need to clean our potatoes. Ask for help from a grown-up to wash the potatoes with water. Then, with the grown-up's help, carefully peel off the potato skin. Peeling means taking off the outer layer, like when you remove the skin of a banana. Once the potato skin is removed, ask the grown-up to cut the potatoes into smaller pieces. Now, it's time to cook the potatoes. In a big pot, boil some water and put the potatoes inside. Cook the potatoes in the water until they become soft. When they are soft, it's easy to mix them and shape them into cutlets. Step 2: Prepare the Eggs and Breadcrumbs Now, we need two medium-sized bowls. In the first bowl, break some eggs and mix them together. In the second bowl, pour some breadcrumbs. We will use these two bowls to coat our cutlets before frying. Step 3: Make the Cutlets Take the cooked potatoes and mash them with a fork or potato masher until they are smooth. Mash like you're playing with playdough! Then, shape the mashed potatoes into small, round cutlets - like mini hamburgers. Dip each potato cutlet into the egg bowl first, and then into the breadcrumbs bowl. Make sure the cutlets get covered with eggs and breadcrumbs so that they become super crispy and yummy. Step 4: Fry the Cutlets Ask your grown-up helper to put some oil in a frying pan and heat it up. Be careful, hot oil can be dangerous! With the grown-up's help, gently place each cutlet into the hot oil. The cutlets need to cook for 2-3 minutes on each side until they turn golden and crispy. When the cutlets are done, use a spatula to carefully place them on a plate with a paper towel to remove extra oil. That's it! Now, your yummy potato and egg cutlets are ready to eat. Enjoy your homemade cutlets with your favorite sauce or toppings. Happy cooking, little chefs!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  On March 24, 1958, Presley was drafted into the U.S. Army as a private at Fort Chaffee, near Fort Smith, Arkansas. His arrival was a major media event. Hundreds of people descended on Presley as he stepped from the bus; photographers then accompanied him into the fort. Presley announced that he was looking forward to his military stint, saying that he did not want to be treated any differently from anyone else: \\"The Army can do anything it wants with me.\\"Presley commenced basic training at Fort Hood, Texas. During a two-week leave in early June, he recorded five songs in Nashville. In early August, his mother was diagnosed with hepatitis, and her condition rapidly worsened. Presley, granted emergency leave to visit her, arrived in Memphis on August 12. Two days later, she died of heart failure, aged 46. Presley was devastated; their relationship had remained extremely close—even into his adulthood, they would use baby talk with each other and Presley would address her with pet names.After training, Presley joined the 3rd Armored Division in Friedberg, Germany, on October 1. While on maneuvers, Presley was introduced to amphetamines by a sergeant. He became \\"practically evangelical about their benefits\\", not only for energy but for \\"strength\\" and weight loss as well, and many of his friends in the outfit joined him in indulging. The Army also introduced Presley to karate, which he studied seriously, training with Jürgen Seydel. It became a lifelong interest, which he later included in his live performances. Fellow soldiers have attested to Presley's wish to be seen as an able, ordinary soldier, despite his fame, and to his generosity. He donated his Army pay to charity, purchased TV sets for the base, and bought an extra set of fatigues for everyone in his outfit.While in Friedberg, Presley met 14-year-old Priscilla Beaulieu.

The tale of Homer Hickham and his dream of creating a rocket seem so simple at first, especially when the film is set in a mining town, where the future is as clear cut as the lumps of coal in the mine. But Homer cannot follow in his father's footsteps. With the encouragement of Miss Riley,(a friendly teacher), members of his father's staff, and his friends, Homer attempts to make his dream a reality. Yet as in any true to life story, there are many stops along the way. Director Joe Johnston lowers us into the coal mines, where we witness the chilling plight of miners stooped beneath a ceiling of rock. With lit helmets and bent posture, they resembled alien insectoids more than humans in the darkness. The hacking coughs of the miners and the blackened faces were a constant reminder of the danger the miners faced in their work. Contrasting the mine shaft's lugubrious load are the images of Homer and his friend's rocket launches. Underneath the blue bowl of sky, rockets are placed upon a pad and launched into the stratosphere...And nothing can match the scene when Homer sees Sputnik for the first time. Yet what makes the film so endearing is the relationship between the characters. Homer's father is a classic hardened man...but he has a soft side as well. We see that he does love his son, despite their many arguments. The love and support of Miss Riley is evident as well. Best of all, the film is uncomfortable. It doesn't tie everything up in a nice bow. It tears at you, lifts you up. It keeps an air of reality, which is important in a film like this. This film can be considered a complete work. At first, I was disappointed that the film did not continue with Homer's life. I didn't want it to end. Then I realized...that's what a good film does to a person.

Question: I'm going to take something that happened to my daughter for this answer. Billie Jo (our daughter) was probably around ten years old when it happened. We had a young Black Labrador dog who had become quite smitten with chewing things up that she wasn't supposed to. The list grew longer as the months passed. Looker, our black lab, had chewed up and eaten a 10 bill, my VCR remote control (probably around 1987), and a sticker-filled blackberry vine my wife had planted. How she did that one without serious repercussions is beyond me. She also had a habit of grabbing the mail as it slid through the slot that was in our front door, taking it out back and 'sorting' it for us. So what happened really came as no big surprise. My daughter was a very diligent student, never wanting to let down her teachers by not turning her homework in as soon as she got to school (at least until she hit 14). One morning our daughter was trying to find the math homework that she knew she had completed the night before. My wife assisted in the search and soon found a partially chewed up piece of our daughter's homework page. Our daughter was devastated! How could she possibly walk in to school and publicly announce, “My dog ate my homework!” without becoming the laughing stock of the school? Like this: Mama Bear (my wife) storms into the classroom and vehemently upholds our daughter's “dog ate my homework” bit, showing the teacher the half eaten paper. Funny thing was, the teacher would have never doubted our little girl for one minute. Back then, Billie Jo was the sweetest, cutest, most polite and well mannered child a parent could possibly hope for. And her teachers loved her. So, if you have partial proof, it can be a valid excuse. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why was the daughter devestated?

Providing a holistic view, we will dissect the arguments made by those who oppose the order and explore the implications for Virginia's criminal justice system and the state's political landscape. Step 2: Summarize the order In 2016, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe issued an executive order that restored voting rights to over 200,000 convicted felons who had completed their sentences, including those on probation or parole. The basis for this order was to remove the lifelong voting ban on these individuals and to foster their reintegration into society. Step 3: Present the arguments against the order Critics argue that the Virginia order on felon voting restoration is unconstitutional for several reasons. They claim that: 1. The governor overstepped his authority: Opponents assert that Gov. McAuliffe exceeded the powers granted to him by the Virginia Constitution, which only allows for restoration of voting rights on an individual basis. By restoring the rights of an entire class of individuals en masse, the governor is said to have circumvented the intended checks and balances within the state government. 2. Violation of the separation of powers: Rivals claim that the order infringes on the legislative branch's authority to determine voting qualifications. By unilaterally restoring voting rights to large groups of felons, the governor effectively altered the qualifications for voting without proper legislative action. 3. Politically motivated decision: Detractors highlight that a significant number of affected individuals belong to demographic groups that traditionally lean Democratic. They suspect that the move might have been an attempt to manipulate voter demographics in favor of the Democratic Party. Step 4: Discuss the implications of the order If the Virginia order on felon voting restoration were deemed unconstitutional, it would have several implications: 1. Voting rights rollback: Thousands of felons who had their rights restored would once again be disenfranchised, further hindering their reintegration into society and potentially affecting their ability to contribute positively as citizens. 2. Legal battles: A decision against the order could prompt legal challenges and appeals, creating a prolonged legal tug-of-war that may drain resources and divert public attention from other pressing issues. 3. Impact on the political landscape: An invalidation of the order could stir political tensions and perhaps lead to polarization, as it could be perceived as stripping voting rights from citizens – a fundamental aspect of democracy. Step 5: Concluding thoughts The Virginia order on felon voting restoration has sparked a heated debate over its constitutionality and the scope of a governor's power. Regardless of the outcome, it remains crucial to strike a balance between the competing goals of protecting the democratic process and ensuring that all citizens have the opportunity to participate in it. Ultimately, the weight of the decision lies with the judicial system, and its resolution will certainly have lasting effects on both the felons and the state's political climate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The sand was filtered using the sift instead of the machine because the  Pick your answer from: A. sift was simple to use. B. machine was simple to use.","output":"The sand was filtered using the sift instead of the machine because the sift was simple to use. In a world where technology is constantly advancing and complex machinery is becoming increasingly prevalent, sometimes, it's best to return to the basics. Although there are certain advantages associated with using a machine, in this instance, the simplicity and ease of use associated with the sift made it the clear choice for accomplishing our objective. One of the primary reasons that the sift was ultimately selected over the machine is due to the minimal learning curve associated with its use. While machines may streamline the sand-filtering process, they can also be complicated to operate and maintain. On the other hand, a sift is an uncomplicated tool consisting of a mesh and a frame. This setup allows anybody, regardless of their experience with machinery, to easily pick up the sift and begin filtering sand without requiring extensive training or previous knowledge. Additionally, the simplicity of the sift provides several logistical benefits. A machine may require a power source and operational maintenance, as well as repairs and replacement parts when necessary. These factors can lead to increased cost and environmental impact over time. In contrast, a sift requires little to no maintenance, is not reliant on external power sources and is less likely to break, making it a more sustainable and cost-effective option in the long run. Moreover, the sift's simplicity fosters a greater degree of control over the sand-filtering process. With a machine, users may be limited in their ability to manipulate variables such as the force exerted or the size of the grains filtered. Conversely, using a sift allows for direct, hands-on control over these variables, granting the user the ability to tailor the filtering process to their specific needs. Furthermore, the use of a sift can promote mindfulness and attentiveness in a way that relying on machinery may not. By requiring manual action and oversight, the sift encourages users to be present and focused throughout the entire filtering process. This can lead to a deeper understanding of the sand and its properties, as well as an appreciation for the work being done. Lastly, using a sift can instill a sense of personal accomplishment that may not be present when relying solely on a machine. There is a unique satisfaction that comes from knowing that you've directly contributed to a project and achieved your goals through personal effort and determination. In conclusion, while machines possess several benefits and may often represent a rational choice for accomplishing various tasks, the decision to use a sift for filtering sand in this scenario was primarily due to its simplicity and ease of use. In instances like these, it's essential to carefully consider the advantages and drawbacks of each available tool before making a final decision to ensure that the most suitable and effective option is selected."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Bernanke Hints at Possible Sale of Mortgage Assets In testimony Thursday before the House Financial Services Committee, Mr. Bernanke did not depart from the Fed’s stance that it intended to keep short-term interest rates near zero for “an extended period,” given that unemployment remained high and inflation was expected to remain low. But he offered a glimpse into his thinking about the timing and pace of the Fed’s eventual withdrawal from its monetary policies of the last two years. The Fed’s balance sheet has grown to about 2.3 trillion, about 2.5 times its size before the crisis. The central bank bought up mortgage-backed securities, Treasury securities and debts guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in an effort to hold down long-term interest rates as the economy went into a tailspin in 2008. In addition, the Fed created several emergency lending programs to pump credit into the economy. While the lending programs have mostly ended, the giant balance sheet, which includes a large volume of bank reserves that the Fed created as it bought the assets, poses a difficult challenge for Mr. Bernanke. Mr. Bernanke was originally to testify before the Financial Services Committee about the Fed’s exit strategy on Feb. 10, but the hearing was postponed because of a snowstorm. “I currently do not anticipate that the Federal Reserve will sell any of its security holdings in the near term, at least until after policy tightening has gotten under way and the economy is clearly in a sustainable recovery,” Mr. Bernanke wrote in that testimony, which was released after the hearing was postponed. On Thursday, Mr. Bernanke omitted reference to “the near term.” He said, “Restoring the size and composition of the balance sheet to a more normal configuration is a longer-term objective of our policies.” The Fed plans to experiment with two tools, reverse repurchase agreements and term deposits, to drain the large store of bank reserves and replace them with other liabilities. Those tools would not change the overall size of the balance sheet. “If necessary, as a means of applying monetary restraint, the Federal Reserve also has the option of redeeming or selling securities,” Mr. Bernanke said. He was careful to avoid specifying a time frame, but he told Representative Jeb Hensarling, a Texas Republican, “We would like to get back to an all-Treasury portfolio within a reasonable amount of time.” Traditionally, the Fed bought and sold Treasury securities to lower and raise the key interest rate it controls, the federal funds rate. Later, in response to a question from Representative Stephen F. Lynch, Democrat of Massachusetts, Mr. Bernanke said, “My expectation is that sales would be slow, gradual, announced in advance and would not create undue market impacts.” Even if the Fed were to do nothing, the balance sheet would slowly shrink as the securities mature or as Fannie or Freddie redeem their debts. But Mr. Bernanke said the Fed had no intention of holding onto the securities — some of them backed by 30-year fixed-rate mortgages — indefinitely. “We certainly don’t want to hold this stuff for 30 years,” he told Representative Scott Garrett, Republican of New Jersey. The Fed’s exit strategy is untested, and several economists who testified after Mr. Bernanke warned of potential risks. Marvin Goodfriend, of the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University, warned that reverse repurchase agreements, in which the Fed would sell securities with an agreement to buy them back later a slightly higher price, could expose the Fed to private sector risks. He said that term deposits, analogous to certificates of deposit, would also compete with Treasury bills and “potentially cause friction with the Treasury.” John B. Taylor, an influential Stanford economist, said the Fed might want to follow an “exit rule,” reducing reserve balances by 100 billion for each 0.25 percent increase in the federal funds rate. Other economists were more optimistic about the choices the Fed faced. Laurence M. Ball, of Johns Hopkins University, said the Fed should not raise rates “until we see major progress in reducing unemployment,” even if inflation starts to rise. A moderate rise in inflation, he said, could even be good for the economy. Laurence H. Meyer, an economic forecaster and former Fed governor, testified that the risk of high inflation was remote unless the central bank came under political pressure. “The Fed is operating in uncharted waters,” he warned. “It has never had such a challenging exit. Don’t expect the Fed to be perfect. Nobody is perfect.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The most important parts of this news article are: 1.

Which is likely less dense diamond or ball?    Assuming that:  A given volume of a denser substance is heavier than the same volume of a less dense substance. Answer:","output":"To determine which is likely to be less dense between a diamond the size of a beach ball and a beach ball itself, it is important to understand the concept of density and how it relates to the mass and volume of an object. Density is defined as the mass per unit volume of a substance, which can be mathematically expressed as: Density = Mass / Volume The density of a substance is an important property that can help identify an object's buoyancy, as well as its ability to withstand certain forces and pressures. The main idea behind this question is to understand that for a given volume, a denser substance weighs more than a less dense substance. Now, let's consider the given objects - a diamond the same size as a beach ball and a beach ball. 1. Diamond the size of a beach ball A diamond is a crystalline form of carbon and is known for its superior hardness and strength. The density of diamond varies depending on factors like impurities, crystal orientation, and pressure; however, its average density is around 3.5 g/cm³. 2. Beach ball A beach ball, on the other hand, is typically made of lightweight materials such as PVC or plastic material, which is less dense than a diamond. The exact density of a beach ball's material can vary depending on the manufacturing process and materials used, but it is generally much lower than that of a diamond, approximately around 0.9-1.5 g/cm³. Given the nature of the question, we can assume that the diamond and beach ball have the same volume. As we already know, the density of the diamond is around 3.5 g/cm³, and the density of the beach ball material is approximately 0.9-1.5 g/cm³.  Recalling the initial assumption that a given volume of a denser substance is heavier than the same volume of a less dense substance, it becomes evident that the diamond has a higher density compared to the beach ball material. Therefore, the beach ball is likely to be less dense than the diamond of the same size."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Valuable artwork from Stevens's private collection is also on board the jetliner, to be eventually displayed in his new museum. Such a collection motivates a group of thieves led by co-pilot Bob Chambers to hijack the aircraft. Once Captain Don Gallagher leaves the cockpit and is knocked unconscious, the hijackers' plans go into action.

Sweat beaded on his brow and he felt his cotton shirt stick to his skin under his coat. Jon took off his soft-brimmed hat and wiped his forehead. He examined the hat as he let his breath return. The hat had kept the burning sun and beating rain off his head for as long as Jon owned the farm. He wore it every day. It had been a gift given to him on the day he married Alasandra but he could not remember who gave it to him. Jon put it back on his head and pushed the tiller deep into the stubborn earth. Daven ran over the hill and down the cart path leading to their small cobblestone house. The boy had only left a short while ago and he held no sack with the bread and cheese his mother had told him to buy. Jon furrowed his brow.

Alan Victor White (born 26 May 1972 in Lewisham, South London) is an English rock drummer, best known as being the drummer of the English rock band Oasis from 1995 to 2004. Before Oasis, he was the drummer of Starclub from 1991 to 1994. He is the longest serving drummer in Oasis's history, performing on four studio albums, two compilation albums and one live album during his tenure. He joined the band in May 1995 after the band's original drummer Tony McCarroll was removed from the band. White replaced original Oasis drummer Tony McCarroll in May 1995 and was immediately \\"thrown in the deep end\\", joining the band the very next day to perform a playback of \\"Some Might Say\\" in front of a national TV audience on BBC1's long running music programme Top of The Pops. One of White's first live shows with Oasis was in front of a massive crowd at the Glastonbury Festival in June 1995.  Until the arrival of Andy Bell in the Autumn of 1999, White was the token southerner in the otherwise Mancunian Oasis. Initially known as 'Whitey', he was later re-christened 'Dave' by the band because he once served himself a drink from an unattended bar, therefore resembling the character Dave from \\"The Winchester\\" in the '70s TV series Minder. White commented on the \\"North/South divide\\" saying it was not that bad, but \\"for ages I was the 'Cockney cunt' and they were the 'Manc fuckers'\\". In his book What's the Story? Ian Robertson (who served as Oasis' tour manager from 1994 to 1995) stated that White was also known by the phrase \\"Alan White - He's alright\\". White was also entrusted with the job of being Liam Gallagher's 'official' drinking partner and was also said to be his best friend in the band. Together the pair were known as 'Bert and Ernie', named after the Sesame Street-characters. In December 2002 Liam and White were involved in a high-profile brawl in a German bar. Consequently, Liam lost some of his front teeth, and White needed a brain scan after suffering minor head injuries. Both were arrested by the authorities and were released only after the band's management paid for their bail.  Noel Gallagher has stated that White had a far greater significance to the band than a mere session and touring drummer, claiming that he helped immensely in the recording process. Noel also said that when he wrote a song he would play it to White who would often adapt the rhythm of the song or advise Gallagher on possible changes in the tempo.  At the time of his departure White was the longest-serving member in Oasis beside the Gallaghers (he has since been passed by Andy Bell) and passed through thin and thick with the brothers despite being struck down several times with bouts of alleged tendinitis during his later years with the band. White performed on four of Oasis' studio albums: (What's the Story) Morning Glory? (1995), Be Here Now (1997), Standing on the Shoulder of Giants (2000) and Heathen Chemistry (2002). He also played on the majority of band's B-sides, some of which were released on the record The Masterplan (1998).  White married model Liz Atkins on 13 August 1997 at Studley Priory Hotel, Oxfordshire. He had met her on the set of the \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\" music video. The couple divorced in 2000. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What was the first song he did with them?","output":"The first song Alan Victor White performed with Oasis was \\"Some Might Say.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After a terrible car accident that left her comatose for six weeks, Emptage emerged to discover that her memories had been wiped clean from the past decade. With fuzzy recollections from the 1990s and no memories of her life after the age of 22, the now 40-year-old mother from County Durham had a harrowing journey ahead of her to rediscover her life and make sense of her new reality. In an unfortunate turn of events, Emptage was driving her car when she suddenly collided with an ambulance. Firefighters in Gateshead leaped into action, rescuing Emptage and transporting her to the hospital for immediate medical attention. After an agonizing battle for survival, Emptage awoke from her coma to find herself in a world that she couldn't recognize or comprehend. In her mind's eye, she remained a youngster in her early 20s, when the Spice Girls dominated the charts and it was still the era of the 1990s. Confused and disoriented, Emptage believed that she had aged only recently, though she had in fact turned 40. But the most devastating consequence of the memory loss was her inability to recognize her own daughter, Maddie, who was by then 14 years old. Moreover, Emptage could not recall her boyfriend at the time, intensifying her sense of confusion and disarray. With only the memories of her experiences as a 22-year-old former model, Emptage's journey to reclaim her past was ardorsome but necessary. During her rehabilitation in the hospital, she had to relearn even the most basic of human functions, such as walking. In an instant, more than a decade of memories had vanished, forcing her to start anew. Candace Emptage's incredible story highlights the fragility of our memories and the challenges that individuals face when living through such traumatic experiences. Her resilience and determination to overcome this life-altering event is a testament to the human spirit and the power of perseverance. As Emptage continues to rediscover her life and piece together the puzzle of her past, her journey serves as an inspiration for anyone grappling with their own adversities and obstacles."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

The lyrics were written after the music was created, sometimes as late as the day of recording. As Johns dreads writing lyrics, he suggested that the band could produce an instrumental album at some stage in the future. Johns is the band's primary songwriter, and notes that while Joannou and Gillies do not have significant influence on what he writes, they are key to the band's overall sound. For that album, Hamilton co-wrote four songs with Johns including the APRA Award-winning \\"Straight Lines\\". Joannou believed that Young Modern was simpler than Diorama but \\"still as complex underneath with simple pop song elements\\". He said that much of the band's success resulted from trying to push themselves harder in recording and writing. Self-producing has allowed the band to do so without the pressures of a record label.Gillies notes that Silverchair will often \\"run the risk of losing fans\\" with their work, and this was evident in the changes in musical direction in Diorama and Young Modern. However, he described this as a good thing, describing the fact \\"that we haven't been pigeonholed, and people really don't know what to expect\\" as one of the attractive elements of the band.

Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor. PUBLISHED:. 09:38 EST, 11 July 2013. |. UPDATED:. 01:35 EST, 12 July 2013. George Osborne has started wearing a hi-tech wristband which makes sure he gets a good night’s sleep. The Chancellor of the Exchequer revealed he uses the UP wristband to monitor his sleep patterns and track his fitness regime. The black plastic Jawbone wristband links up with a smartphone app to allow users to take a ‘holistic approach to a healthy lifestyle’. Grilling: George Osborne was seen wearing the black wristband while giving evidence to the Treasury select committee. Worries that senior ministers are struggling to sleep at night seem to be spreading in government. It has emerged that Education Secretary Michael Gove has also taken to wearing a Jawbone wristband. Mr Osborne’s black version was first spotted as he gave evidence to the Treasury select committee this morning. It. was visible under the cuff of his right sleeve as he was grilled on his. plans for tax and spending. He has also been seen wearing it while out. running. Later he told. journalists that the gadget, which costs around £100, was given to him. as a birthday present when he turned 42 in May. What it shows. The technology works by monitoring. whether the user is in deep or light sleep and only wakes them at the. best time so they start the day feeling refreshed. It. also monitors physical activity 24/7, providing a record of the. Chancellor’s morning jog around St James’ Park near the Treasury. It. also makes it ‘fun and easy’ to keep track of what users eat, although. it is not known if he used it to record eating a Byron burger in the. Treasury on the eve of his Spending Review speech last month. The up device links in to a smartphone app which provides an on-screen 'daily dashboard'. Gift: The Chancellor revealed the £100 Jawbone gadget was a gift for his 42nd birthday in May. Active: The gadget tracks the wearer's movements 24 hours a day, including when the Chancellor goes jogging in central London. Manufacturers Jawbone say that the system 'not only visualizes your information so you can understand the meaning behind the numbers, it also discovers hidden connections in the way you live to deliver powerful insights. Over time, insights lead to new behaviors and new behaviors become new, healthier habits'. The wristband tracks movements during sleep to record periods of light and deep slumber and waking moments during the night. Its precision motion detection system captures a complete record of daily activity - or inactivity. Users can create a database of their diet by scanning barcodes and taking photos of their meals. Nutrition: The app can also be used to track what the user eats, including the Byron burger the Chancellor was pictured eating on the eve of his Spending Review last month. Mr Osborne explained why he was using it as he addressed a press gallery lunch with journalists in Westminster. He said: ‘It was a birthday present. It measures how far you walk but it also measures your sleep patterns, your deep and light sleep. ‘I was pleased to note yesterday that Michael Gove was also wearing one.’ Asked how it is helping him to relax at night, the Chancellor replied: ‘I always sleep well.’ The UP device markets itself as a way to 'KNOW YOURSELF LIVE BETTER' There have been portable fitness gadgets on the market for many years now, but the Jawbone UP was the first designed to live full-time with its user. First released in 2011, it was withdrawn because of technical problems. After being totally re-engineered, it was relaunched the following year. However some blogs and reviews have claimed that the new, remodelled wristband still has glitches, with some people saying theirs stopped working shortly after buying the product, others claiming it records false information and some complaining it disrupts their sleep. Costing around £100, the portable personal trainer tracks a person’s eating habits, sleep and exercise - syncing with an app on a user’s mobile phone to offer advice about how to be healthier. From the moment a person wakes - by vibrating at the 'best' possible moment according to sleep patterns - the machine monitors everything they do, prompting the wearer to get up and move if they have been sat still, and even to 'log' everything they eat. Jawbone describe the UP as 'attractive, durable, water-resistant and unobtrusive' and even suggests it can be worn with a cocktail dress as easily as with gym kit. Inside the wristband is a motion sensor which stores steps, calories burned, distance, and active versus inactive time. The motion sensor even tracks the user while they sleep - tracking their movement to gauge when they fall asleep, how long it takes, and how much deep sleep they’re getting. If that wasn't enough, the iPhone app prompts the user to take photographs of every meal, and tracks where, when and what they have eaten. A 'Feed' screen on the mobile phone then offers an up-to-date stream of information about how a person is progressing with respect to your health. It also links with online 'health challenges' to set you tasks to achieve during the week. Highlights:","output":"1. UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, revealed his use of the Jawbone UP wristband to monitor sleep patterns and track fitness. 2. The wristband syncs with a smartphone app to provide a holistic approach to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. 3. Education Secretary Michael Gove has also been spotted wearing a Jawbone wristband. 4.

Possible answers: --different meanings; --the same meaning;","output":"The word \\"serve\\" has slightly different meanings in the two sentences provided. In general, the verb \\"serve\\" refers to the action of performing a service, duty, or function. However, its interpretation varies based on the context in which it is used. In the first sentence - \\"They serve a restricted role on the bench.\\" - \\"serve\\" refers to fulfilling or executing a particular function or duty. In this context, the individuals mentioned are limited in their capacity or the scope of their responsibilities while being a part of the bench or panel, likely in a judicial setting. This restricted role might be due to several factors such as experience, the nature of the case, or the jurisdiction's regulations. Thus, the emphasis here is on the fulfillment of a specific function with certain limitations. In the second sentence - \\"She served in Congress for two terms.\\" - \\"serve\\" refers to holding a particular position of authority and responsibility as a public servant. In this context, the individual is actively participating in the political process and representing her constituents in Congress for the duration of two terms. In this case, the emphasis is on the tenure and completion of the elected term. Although both meanings are related to carrying out a duty or responsibility, the first usage highlights limitations in the role, while the second highlights representation, participation, and completion of elected terms. Therefore, the word \\"serve\\" has slightly different meanings in the contexts provided. In conclusion: --different meanings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I believed that when the weight disappeared, it would take old wounds, hurts and rejections with it. Many weight-conscious people also mistakenly believe that changing our bodies will fix _ . Perhaps our mistake is believing that being thin equals being loved, being special, and being cherished. We fantasize   about what it will be like when we reach the long-awaited goal .We work very hard to realize this dream. Then, at last, we find ourselves there. But we often gain back what we have lost. Even so, we continue to believe that next time it will be different. Next time, we will keep it off. Next time, being thin will finally fulfill its promise of everlasting happiness, self-worth, and, of course, love. It took me a long time to realize that there was something more for me to learn about beauty. Beauty standards vary with culture. In Samoa a woman is not considered attractive unless she weighs more than 200 pounds. More importantly, if it's happiness that we want, why not put our energy there rather than on the size of our body? Why not look inside? Many of us strive hard to change our body, but in vain. We have to find a way to live comfortably inside our body and make friends with and cherish ourselves. When we change our attitudes towards ourselves, the whole world changes.

Some things we've done are very good for the earth while some are bad. All over the world, people have cut down millions of trees. When it rains or when the wind blows, the earth is taken away. Forests have become deserts, so more and more sorts of animals and plants are disappearing. In big cities, cars and buses have polluted the air. Many people in cities now have health problems. Factories have also polluted the land and the water. As a result, many rivers and lakes are now dead. Around the earth, there's a special kind of oxygen called \\"ozone\\"(O3). It is important to the earth. But now air pollution is destroying it and that has made a very big hole in the ozone layer. Too much harmful radiation from the sun passes through the hole and reaches the earth directly. This is very dangerous because this kind of radiation can cause cancer. Carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air has increased a lot. It mainly comes from burning oil, coal and wood. This has formed a \\"blanket\\" around the earth.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was honored in 1884 and awarded with a lifetime pension? ?  Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (English:  chy-KOF-skee; Russian: Пётр Ильи́ч Чайко́вский, tr. Pyótr Ilʹyích Chaykóvskiy, IPA: [pʲɵtr ɪlʲˈjitɕ tɕɪjˈkofskʲɪj] (listen); 7 May 1840 [O.S. 25 April] – 6 November [O.S. 25 October] 1893), was a Russian composer of the romantic period, whose works are among the most popular music in the classical repertoire. He was the first Russian composer whose music made a lasting impression internationally, bolstered by his appearances as a guest conductor in Europe and the United States. He was honored in 1884 by Emperor Alexander III, and awarded a lifetime pension. Although musically precocious, Tchaikovsky was educated for a career as a civil servant. There was scant opportunity for a musical career in Russia at that time and no system of public music education. When an opportunity for such an education arose, he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory, from which he graduated in 1865. The formal Western-oriented teaching he received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five, with whom his professional relationship was mixed. Tchaikovsky's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood. From this reconciliation he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style—a task that did not prove easy. The principles that governed melody, harmony and other fundamentals of Russian music ran completely counter to those that governed Western European music; this seemed to defeat the potential for using Russian music in large-scale Western composition or for forming a composite style, and it caused personal antipathies that dented Tchaikovsky's self-confidence. Russian culture exhibited a split personality, with its native and adopted elements having drifted apart increasingly since the time of Peter the Great. This resulted in uncertainty among the intelligentsia about the country's national identity—an ambiguity...

Early house music was generally characterized by repetitive 4/4 beats, rhythms provided by drum machines, off-beat hi-hat cymbals, and synthesized basslines. While house displayed several characteristics similar to disco music, which preceded and influenced it, as both were DJ and record producer-created dance music, house was more electronic and minimalistic. The mechanical, repetitive rhythm of house was one of its main components. Many house compositions were instrumental, with no vocals; some had singing throughout the song with lyrics; and some had singing but no actual words. House music developed in Chicago's underground dance club culture in the early 1980s, as DJs from the subculture began altering the pop-like disco dance tracks to give them a more mechanical beat and deeper basslines. As well, these DJs began to mix synth pop, rap, Latin, and even jazz into their tracks. Latin music, particularly salsa clave rhythm, became a dominating riff of house music. It was pioneered by Chicago DJs such as  Chip E., and Steve Hurley. It was influenced by Chicago DJ and record producer Frankie Knuckles, the Chicago acid-house electronic music group Phuture, and the Tennessee DJ/producer Mr. Fingers. The genre was originally associated with the Black American LGBT subculture but has since spread to the mainstream. From its beginnings in the Chicago club and local radio scene, the genre spread internationally to London, then to American cities such as New York City and Detroit, and eventually globally.Chicago house music acts from the early to mid-1980s found success on the US dance charts on various Chicago independent record labels that were more open to sign local house music artists. These same acts also experienced some success in the United Kingdom, garnering hits in that country.

With her bulging forehead, double chin and thin pursed lips, Jane Seymour was no oil painting…if Tudor oil paintings are to be believed. Twenty-first century actresses, meanwhile, tend to have a natural beauty. Which has left the makers of the BBC's big budget adaptation of Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall with something of a dilemma. Scroll down for video. Historian Lucy Worsley has reportedly said that Kate Phillips, pictured left, who plays Henry VIII's wife Jane Seymour, portrait pictured right, in BBC drama Wolf Hall is too pretty. While they have gone to great lengths to nail down historical details for the drama, they have been accused by a TV historian of casting a woman who is 'too pretty' to play Henry VIII's third wife. The public largely gets its image of Seymour from the portrait of her by Tudor artist Hans Holbein, depicting her with a noticeably large forehead. However, she is played in the series by Kate Phillips, 25, who cannot be faulted when it comes to her looks. According to Lucy Worsley, 41, chief curator at Historic Royal Palaces, Miss Phillips – in her first professional role – has features which are too dainty. Miss Worsley said: 'She's too pretty. I did challenge Peter Kosminsky [the director] about that. He laughed and said, 'I picked her because of her acting, not because of her forehead'.' Homeland star Damian Lewis plays Henry VIII in the six-part series on the rapid rise to power of Sir Thomas Cromwell in King Henry's court. But, speaking yesterday, the historian said it was not a remark she would extend to the whole cast, which includes Homeland star Damien Lewis, 43, and Claire Foy, 30. She said: 'They are not all fantastically good looking, are they? 'Mark Rylance [who plays Thomas Cromwell] has a wonderful craggy, creased face and, on the whole, as a cast I would say they are human rather than beautiful. It's not like it's been turned into a pageant show.' Reverend Diarmaid MacCulloch, professor of the history of the church at the University of Oxford, said he didn't see Miss Phillips' beauty as a problem: 'Ideas of beauty change from century to century and you might as well make them beautiful on our terms, because it's quite possible that the portraits of Jane Seymour that we've got were meant to flatter and give the impression that she was a beautiful woman.' Historians also pointed out that Montacute House in Somerset, which was used to portray Greenwich Palace, is Elizabethan. Author Dame Hilary has  said courtiers would have had white teeth, as sugar was not yet widely available. She also said members of the court would not have been covered in filth. He continued that while the show is not an 'exact fit on the history', it is an impressive 'evocation of the period'. Wolf Hall, which starts tomorrow night on BBC Two, is a six-part adaptation of Mantel's Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies novels. Miss Worsley questioned the authenticity of some aspects of the programme, claiming both the original books and now this adaptation have brought the characters firmly into the modern day. She said: 'What Hilary Mantel has done is made these characters people for our times, which is interesting for a historian to watch. They are immensely modern, they won't be saying thee and thou and being all dramatic and over the top. 'I think it will make people think the Tudors were just like us in many ways. That's a massive historical question, in some ways they were and in some ways they weren't.' The programme-makers have revealed the lengths they have gone to to ensure historical accuracy – including an unexpected insistence on straight, white teeth and pristine linen. Mantel said a Tudor drama would be less accurate had it insisted on blackened teeth and filthy courtiers – as it was a time when sugar was yet to become widely available. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"The BBC adaptation of Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall has faced criticism from TV historian Lucy Worsley, who claimed that actress Kate Phillips is \\"too pretty\\" to play Jane Seymour, Henry VIII's third wife. Worsley argues that Phillips' features do not align with the historical portrait of Jane Seymour by Tudor artist Hans Holbein. However, the director of the adaptation, Peter Kosminsky, defended the casting choice, saying he picked Phillips for her acting skills rather than her physical appearance. Other historians such as Reverend Diarmaid MacCulloch argue that beauty standards change from century to century and that it is possible that Jane Seymour was considered beautiful in her time. The series, which is a six-part adaptation of Mantel's Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies novels, has placed emphasis on historical accuracy; however, Worsley questions the authenticity of some aspects of the program and the modernization of its characters."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the title of this article: The other usage refers to a language that is socially subordinated to a regional or national standard language, often historically cognate or related to the standard language, but not actually derived from it. In this sense, unlike in the first usage, the standard language would not itself be considered a \\"dialect,\\" as it is the dominant language in a particular state or region, whether in terms of social or political status, official status, predominance or prevalence, or all of the above. Meanwhile, the \\"dialects\\" subordinate to the standard language are generally not variations on the standard language but rather separate (but often related) languages in and of themselves. For example, most of the various regional Romance languages of Italy, often colloquially referred to as Italian \\"dialects,\\" are, in fact, not actually derived from modern standard Italian, but rather evolved from Vulgar Latin separately and individually from one another and independently of standard Italian, long prior to the diffusion of a national standardized language throughout what is now Italy. These various Latin-derived regional languages are therefore, in a linguistic sense, not truly \\"dialects\\" of the standard Italian language, but are instead better defined as their own separate languages. Conversely, with the spread of standard Italian throughout Italy in the 20th century, various regional versions or varieties of standard Italian developed, generally as a mix of the national standard Italian with local regional languages and local accents. These variations on standard Italian, known as regional Italian, would more appropriately be called \\"dialects\\" in accordance with the first linguistic definition of \\"dialect,\\" as they are in fact derived partially or mostly from standard Italian.

Answer:","output":"Without additional context, it's challenging to ascertain what specifically Quinn will want to do next. However, if the context suggests that Quinn was causing trouble and his mother disciplined him which resulted in him not causing any further trouble, there's a good chance that Quinn may try to behave better to avoid further discipline. Here's how I arrive at this prediction: 1. Analyze: The given sentence suggests that Quinn has been given a punishment (his mother spanked him) for some misbehavior. After the punishment, there's mention that he was not causing any more trouble for his mother. 2. Understanding Human Behavior: It's common human behavior, especially in children's case, to seek to avoid unpleasant situations. In this case, the unpleasant situation for Quinn was getting in trouble and being disciplined by his mother. 3. Predicting: Using that understanding of human behavior, we can predict that Quinn might want to behave better in order to avoid getting in trouble again. This would entail refraining from actions that his mother disapproves of. So, it's likely that Quinn's next course of action may be trying to behave better or possibly doing something pleasing to his mother to show that he has listened to her and understood his mistake. However, this is just a predicted behavior based on given context and human behavioral patterns, actual actions may vary based on Quinn's personality and individual reactions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write some highlights for the following article: Angry and violent protests against austerity measures continue to flare across Europe, with thousands of students across Italy fighting cutbacks. Thousands of university and high school students clashed with Italian police during a number of marches in major cities, including Rome, Milan and Naples, where the crowds chanted slogans and carried banners such as ‘save schools not banks’. Up to six policemen were wounded in Rome, police said, after students wearing motorcycle helmets and carrying home-made shields pelted them with stones and tried to rush a police van before being driven back in a baton charge. Students wearing motorcycle helmets clash with police in Rome where six officers were injured. A demonstrator lights a flare during one of the protest in Turin, where a number of students were arrested for scuffles. The protests were the latest in a string of strikes and large-scale street protests against prime minister Mario Monti's spending cuts and economic reforms. ‘The protest is to renew the political class, to get rid of those who are corrupt,’ said Giulio Bianco, 18. ‘The politicians make the ordinary people pay. These are heavy sacrifices, and it is a risky policy to keep imposing them,’ the high school student from Rome said. TV pictures from Bologna showed students throwing eggs at a branch of UniCredit bank and trampling on a BNP Paribas flag, while in Palermo protesters burnt copies of political manifestos. Young people have borne the brunt of rising joblessness in Italy, where the youth unemployment rate is 35 per cent, more than three times the overall level. ‘We are worried about our prospects and about the future of our country,’ Madalina Ursu, 19, told Reuters.

Another students carrying a banner is held back by a group of police after they regain control of the street. Yesterday in Greece police clashed with shipyard workers protesting pay arrears, after they broke into the Defence Ministry grounds, which led to more than 100 arrests. Meanwhile hundreds of farmers on tractors tried to invade the country's second-busiest airport in Crete during an anti-austerity protest. Greece has been gripped by a severe financial crisis since late 2009, and waves of spending cuts and tax hikes have led to frequent strikes and demonstrations. The nation's three-month-old coalition government is currently preparing a major new austerity package demanded by rescue creditors. Unions have promised new protests and a general strike next week when the government's new 13.5 billion Euro program is debated in parliament - where the conservative-led coalition controls enough seats to pass the measures. A protestor is dragged to the floor in Turin, while another covers herself on the ground, surrounded by police. A coloured smoke bomb is released by a student during the marches. Yesterday in Athens more than 100. protesters forced open the shuttered entrance to the defence ministry. complex, crossing the courtyard and blocking the entrance to the general. staff building. Riot police were called in to force back the demonstrators, who were demanding to meet with ministry officials. Greece's. top military officer, General Michalis Kostarakos, was heckled by the. shipyard workers when he came out to speak to them by using their. portable loudspeaker. ‘First. get off my base,’ Kostarakos told the protesters, arguing that the. military had no part in the workers' dispute with the government. Police said 106 people were detained for questioning, prompting another protest gathering outside police headquarters and court building today. Misdemeanor charges were filed against the protesting shipyards workers, 94 of which were detained at the scene and subsequently released, while another 12 individuals were sent before an Athens first instance prosecutor. Riot police used pepper spray to prevent a group of protesters from barging into the building.

Charges were filed against 106 protesting shipyards workers after they broke down a barricade and entered the government's defence ministry. Workers from the Skaramangas Shipyards, which deals mainly with military contacts, say they have not been paid in months. Scuffles broke out as protesters tried to push through the police cordon protecting the entrance to the main building. On the southern island of Crete, hundreds of farmers taking part in an anti-austerity protest yesterday tried to invade the terminal and the runway of Iraklio airport. Police kept them off with tear gas, and one man was detained for trying to drive his tractor onto the runway. Airport authorities said flights were not affected by the protest. Crete is a major tourist destination, attracting more than 44,000 flights last year. Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras said earlier this week that there were still considerable differences between the government and Greece's debt inspectors from the International Monetary Fund, European Commission and European Central Bank over the new austerity package. But he said he hopes to clinch a deal by next week. The country has been in recession since 2008, and the total contraction is projected to reach a cumulative 25 per cent at the end of next year.

Put plastic plastic shoes/socks on the lower legs of your dresser. B). You can also use paper and sea glass (polyester or glass tin). Make sure it's easy to keep line-out. C). Choose whatever colors add personality to your room, though don't use everything as one, because some of the colors don't look good in a given room. Place batting, colorful ribbons and sequins all around your room, if the room is open for dressing. D). Take some small sections of the pillow of one side and wrap them one after the other in rubber bands for some patterns. Take the bowl and put the pillow slowly and carefully in the bowl.","output":"The most logical next event, continuing from your given instructions, would be to follow through with dyeing the pillowcase to create a unique and colorful addition to your summer-inspired room décor. Here are the steps to complete the process: 1. After heating the water and yellow dye mixture for fifteen minutes, make sure to turn off the stove and let the dye solution cool down to a safe temperature. In general, you can wait for about 10-15 minutes for it to become safe enough to handle. 2. While the dye solution is cooling down, proceed with creating a pattern for your pillowcase. To do this, gather some small sections of the pillowcase and wrap each with rubber bands. You can create simple patterns such as stripes, circles, or any design that you prefer. The sections that are tightly wrapped with rubber bands will resist the dye and remain white, while the rest of the pillowcase will be dyed yellow. 3. Once the dye solution has cooled down to a safe temperature, carefully lower the rubber banded pillowcase into the diluted dye. Depending on how deep you want the color to be, you can leave the pillowcase submerged in the dye solution for 15 minutes to an hour. For a more vibrant and deeper yellow, leave the pillowcase in the solution for a longer time. 4. When you're satisfied with the color, carefully remove the pillowcase from the dye solution and rinse it under cold water. Keep rinsing until the water runs clear, ensuring that you've removed all excess dye. 5. Once fully rinsed, gently remove the rubber bands from the pillowcase, being careful not to tear the fabric. You'll be able to see the unique pattern you've created. 6. Allow the pillowcase to air dry or throw it in the dryer for a quicker drying process. After completing these steps, your dyed pillowcase is ready to be used in your summer-themed room. You can now proceed with decorating the room using the various ideas you mentioned previously, such as placing batting, colorful ribbons, and sequins around the room, using vibrant colors that add personality to space, and utilizing elements like paper and sea glass decor. Make sure you balance and complement the colors and materials to create a visually appealing and refreshing summer atmosphere. Overall, the key is to mix and match different elements to create a unique and cozy ambience perfect for the warmer season."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article that answers the following question: Which happened first, the granting of amnesty to former cabinet members or the resignation of Liang Shiyi?","output":"Title: The Order of Historical Events: Amnesty for Former Cabinet Members and Liang Shiyi's Resignation Introduction In our exploration of history, establishing the correct chronology of events is crucial for understanding cause and effect relationships, as well as the broader context of the time. In this article, we will investigate which happened first: the granting of amnesty to former cabinet members or the resignation of Liang Shiyi. We will delve into the historical context of these events and establish their order in terms of timing. Background Before discussing the two events in question, it is essential to establish their historical context. Liang Shiyi (1869-1933) was a prominent politician in China's late Qing and early Republican periods. He served in various high-ranking government roles, including those of Finance Minister and Premier. As for the amnesty, it is worth mentioning that throughout history, various governments have granted amnesties to former cabinet members, which can either be a political tactic or a means to advance reconciliation. The Resignation of Liang Shiyi Liang Shiyi's resignation as the Premier of the Republic of China took place on May 25, 1922. He took office in September 1921, and his term was marked by the tensions between different political groups. The underlying pressure and criticism from various political factions and the public eventually led to his resignation. His departure from the post represented the end of an era of his political career. The Granting of Amnesty to Former Cabinet Members Amnesty for former cabinet members has occurred on numerous occasions throughout history. For the purpose of our investigation, we will focus on an amnesty granted by the Beiyang government in China – the same historical context as Liang Shiyi's resignation. This amnesty happened on June 5, 1923, when then-President Li Yuanhong declared a general amnesty for individuals, including former cabinet members who have committed political crimes or have been implicated in such actions. Comparison of the Two Events Upon examining the dates of these events, it becomes clear that Liang Shiyi's resignation took place on May 25, 1922, while the amnesty for former cabinet members in the Chinese context occurred on June 5, 1923. Therefore, Liang Shiyi's resignation as Premier precedes the granting of amnesty by almost a year. Conclusion In conclusion, the resignation of Liang Shiyi as Premier of the Republic of China took place first, followed by the granting of amnesty to former cabinet members, both occurring in the context of the Beiyang government. An accurate understanding of historical chronology is crucial for a comprehensive appreciation of the past, as it lays the foundation for further analysis of events down the line."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Originally named Warsaw, the band consisted of singer-songwriter Ian Curtis, guitarist and keyboardist Bernard Sumner, bass player Peter Hook and drummer Stephen Morris. The band was formed by Sumner and Hook after attending a 4 June 1976 Sex Pistols concert at the Lesser Free Trade Hall in Manchester. While Joy Division's early recordings were heavily influenced by early punk, they evolved a unique sound, aided by producer Martin Hannett, which earned their reputation as pioneers of the post-punk movement. Context: Joy Division's style quickly evolved from their punk roots. Their sound during their early inception as Warsaw was described as generic and \\"undistinguished punk-inflected hard-rock\\". Critic Simon Reynolds observed how the band's originality only \\"really became apparent as the songs got slower\\", and their music took on a \\"sparse\\" quality. According to Reynolds, \\"Hook's bass carried the melody, Bernard Sumner's guitar left gaps rather than filling up the group's sound with dense riffage and Steve Morris' drums seemed to circle the rim of a crater.\\" According to music critic Jon Savage, \\"Joy Division were not punk but they were directly inspired by its energy\\". In 1994 Sumner said the band's characteristic sound \\"came out naturally: I'm more rhythm and chords, and Hooky was melody. He used to play high lead bass because I liked my guitar to sound distorted, and the amplifier I had would only work when it was at full volume. When Hooky played low, he couldn't hear himself. Steve has his own style which is different to other drummers. To me, a drummer in the band is the clock, but Steve wouldn't be the clock, because he's passive: he would follow the rhythm of the band, which gave us our own edge.\\"  By Closer, Curtis had adapted a low baritone voice, drawing comparisons to Jim Morrison of the Doors (one of Curtis's favourite bands).  Sumner largely acted as the band's director, a role he continued in New Order. While Sumner was the group's primary guitarist, Curtis played the instrument on a few recorded songs and during a few shows. Curtis hated playing guitar, but the band insisted he do so. Sumner said, \\"He played in quite a bizarre way and that to us was interesting, because no one else would play like Ian\\". During the recording sessions for Closer, Sumner began using self-built synthesisers and Hook used a six-string bass for more melody.  Hannett \\"dedicated himself to capturing and intensifying Joy Division's eerie spatiality\\". Hannett believed punk rock was sonically conservative because of its refusal to use studio technology to create sonic space. The producer instead aimed to create a more expansive sound on the group's records. Hannett said, \\"[Joy Division] were a gift to a producer, because they didn't have a clue. They didn't argue\\". Hannett demanded clean and clear \\"sound separation\\" not only for individual instruments, but even for individual pieces of Morris's drumkit. Morris recalled, \\"Typically on tracks he considered to be potential singles, he'd get me to play each drum on its own to avoid any bleed-through of sound\\". Music journalist Richard Cook noted that Hannett's role was \\"crucial\\". There are \\"devices of distance\\" in his production and \\"the sound is an illusion of physicality\\". Question: Did their music sound differently from getting slower? Answer:","output":"Yes, Joy Division's music did sound different when it got slower. As they moved from their punk roots and the songs became slower, their music became more unique, with a \\"sparse\\" quality. The band's sound changed with Hook's bass carrying the melody, Sumner's guitar leaving gaps, and Morris' drums following the rhythm of the band. This slower and more distinct sound set Joy Division apart and helped them become pioneers of the post-punk movement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Mr Javid was \\"very disappointed\\" they had voted against the \\"ambitious and far-reaching devolution deal\\", he said. Sunderland, Durham, Gateshead and South Tyneside councils said they were not satisfied with reassurances over funding following the UK's decision to leave the European Union.

Please answer this question: Which English football team are nicknamed the Tractor Boys?","output":"The English football team nicknamed the \\"Tractor Boys\\" is Ipswich Town Football Club. Established in 1878, Ipswich Town Football Club (ITFC) is a professional association football club based in the town of Ipswich, Suffolk, England. The nickname \\"Tractor Boys\\" has its origins in the predominantly rural nature of the surrounding Suffolk region and is a reference to the agricultural roots and history of the area. Ipswich Town Football Club has a long and illustrious history in English football. For the majority of their existence, they have played their home games at the iconic Portman Road stadium, which currently has a capacity of approximately 30,000. The stadium has a lively atmosphere and a passionate fanbase that has proudly supported the club across various leagues. Ipswich Town has experienced various degrees of success since its inception. The club achieved their first significant milestone in 1962 when they were crowned as the champions of the English First Division (now known as the Premier League) under the managerial guidance of the legendary Sir Alf Ramsey, who later led the English national team to victory in the 1966 FIFA World Cup. This triumph positioned Ipswich Town as one of the dominant forces in English football at the time. The club's most successful era came in the 1970s and 1980s, under the management of another iconic figure, Sir Bobby Robson. During this period, Ipswich Town won the FA Cup in 1978, and three years later, they secured the prestigious UEFA Cup in 1981. The club also regularly qualified for European competition in those years, competing against the continent's elite clubs. Over the past few decades, however, their fortune has somewhat dwindled. Ipswich Town currently competes in the English Football League (EFL) One, which is the third tier of the English football pyramid, after being relegated from the EFL Championship in the 2018-19 season. The \\"Tractor Boys\\" are working hard to regain their status as a formidable force in English football and seek a return to the upper echelons of the game. In conclusion, the \\"Tractor Boys\\" nickname belongs to the Ipswich Town Football Club in England. With a rich history and a strong connection to their Suffolk home, the team and its supporters hold on to their agricultural nickname with pride and look forward to returning to the top levels of English football in the near future."},{"instruction":"Question: \\"The autumn storms had what effect on the North Sea by 1870?\\"  Context: \\"The French Marines and naval infantry intended for the invasion of northern Germany were dispatched to reinforce the French Army of Châlons and fell into captivity at Sedan along with Napoleon III.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: While your friend might usually love a spur of the moment visit, recovering from surgery is a different matter entirely. Not only do hospitals often have specific visiting hours, your friend might need to prepare physically and emotionally for visitors.  Know the hospitals visiting hours and policies. Depending on where in the hospital your friend is staying, there is different protocol for visitation. If your friend is still in the recovery room, for example, only one visitor at a time is permitted, with the nurse's permission and supervision, and there are stricter rules for personal hygiene. Call the hospital ahead of time to ask about visiting hours and any restrictions. Try to reach a family member or spouse to see when would be a good time to visit. This way, you'll have a better idea of how your friend is feeling, what tests have been run, and whether they're up for visitors. Once you know, plan your visit accordingly. Call or text once more before heading out to make sure your presence is still welcome. Plan to stay about 20 or 30 minutes, but use your judgment. If your friend seems tired or disengaged, you should slip out sooner. If they seem happy to see you, and are excited to talk to you, then feel free to stay longer. A lot of things can be bothersome to patients just out of surgery, so make sure you do not do anything to cause your friend discomfort during your visit.  Do not wear perfume, aftershave or strong smelling lotions as people are often sensitive to smells when they're sick or recovering from surgery. In addition, many healthcare facilities are now fragrance-free.   When you enter and leave a friend's room, wash your hands with soap, water, alcohol rubs, or hand sanitizer. Check with the nurses' station before entering the room, as you could be required to use a gown, gloves and/or a mask. People are more susceptible to germs after an operation. If you have any type of illness, such as a a cold or flu, ask the hospital staff beforehand if it's safe for you to visit your friend, as it usually isn't. If you are a smoker, only smoke in designated areas and do not get cigarette fumes anywhere near your friend. Due to the risk of bacteria and germs spreading, you could be banned from the hospital if you bring a non service dog into the hospital. Do not swear as this is usually against hospital rules and can get you thrown out and/or banned if caught. Avoid the patient's bed, as this can spread germs. Do not sit or put your feet on the bed. Do not touch the patient's wounds or any medical equipment they are attached to. Do not use the patient's toilet or bathroom, this can also spread germs and bacteria, and nurses may also report you and have you removed from the hospital. Do not share any property, such as toiletries or tissues, with a patient. People love to receive gifts, especially if they're not feeling well. It's not about the money spent, but just knowing that a person cares. Consider bringing a small gift to your friend for them to enjoy post-surgery.  Many people think to bring flowers, but flowers are not ideal for a hospital stay. They take up a great deal of room, and shelf-space in a hospital room is limited. They also decay quickly, and are hard to transport home. Boredom is a huge issue with hospital patients, so consider an interactive gift. Try novels, magazines, crossword puzzle, sudoku books, or a journal. If your friend has some kind of electronic media, like an iPad or tablet, try iTunes or Amazon gift certificates, so they can select and purchase entertaining media for themselves. If food is allowed, bring the patient their favorite snack, as hospital food can get tiresome. However, keep in mind that even if you mean well, they might not want to eat, as surgery and medications can affect their appetite. Many patients are placed on special diets following surgery, and some patients may not be allowed to eat until normal bowel function returns, such as after a bowel resection surgery. A hospital can be a drab, impersonal space. If your friend is there for a prolonged recovery period, try to make their hospital room feel less alien by creating a homey environment for your friend.  Decorate the room. Hospital rooms are beige or white and this can grow depressing with time. Bring cheerful posters, a small decorative hanging, or colorful blankets and throw pillows. Just check with hospital staff first to make sure you're not violating any hospital policies.  Bring them something familiar. During a traumatic event like a surgery, familiarity can be a comfort. Make a small scrapbook of friends, family members, beloved pets, and other loved ones. Borrow your friend's iPod and create custom playlist of their favorite feel better songs or burn them a mix CD. Buy DVD's of their favorite movies and TV shows, as many hospital rooms have a television set patients can use. Act natural when visiting. Your friend is probably eager to get back to a sense of normal, so share news of mutual friends and discuss what's been happening in the news or on TV. Let your friend feel like they're part of the world even if they are stuck in a hospital room. If possible, and after you make sure your friend is up to it, get a group of friends together to visit your friend.  Group visits can feel like a more natural hang out session than one-on-one communication, as people often congregate in groups. Your friend will also be happy to see how many people care and have taken the time to visit. Check hospital policy to make sure there isn't a cap on the number of people permitted in a room at a time. Making some future plans and promises can give your friend something to look forward to after their hospital stay, and reassurance their needs won't be forgotten once they're released.  Set a date to go see a movie, go out to dinner, get coffee, go shopping, etc., sometime after they will be released from the hospital. Your friend will appreciate having something small to look forward to after their stay is over. Offer any assistance in the transition back home, such as driving your friend back from the hospital and running errands for them during recovery. Summary:","output":"Visiting your friend in hospital after their surgery takes a bit of careful planning. Hospitals usually have particular visiting hours and rules you need to follow, so it's best to give them a call before you go. This way you know things like how long you can stay, if you need to wear special things like a gown, gloves or mask to keep germs away, and if it's okay for you to be there if you're feeling a bit sick yourself. You should also check to see that your friend is feeling up to having visitors.  When you visit, keep your friend comfortable by not wearing strong smells and not touching their bed or medical stuff, because that can spread germs. Also, remember to wash your hands properly! A little gift can really cheer up your friend - perhaps a puzzle book, a magazine, or even a little snack if they're allowed to eat. And if your friend will be in hospital for quite some time, why not decorate their room a little, to make it feel more like home? Try to act normal and give your friend a sense of life outside the hospital and even plan some future visits or activities for when they're feeling better. Just remember, always follow the hospital rules to keep everyone safe and healthy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Renewable Energy Resource Sunlight Sunlight can be used to heat homes. It can also be used to produce electricity. This conversion is made possible by solar cells. However, solar energy may not always be practical. Some areas are just too cloudy. Example Solar panels on the roof of this house generate enough electricity to supply a familys needs. Moving Water Falling water can have a lot of energy. Its energy can be converted into kinetic energy. This energy can turn a turbine and generate electricity. The water may fall naturally over a waterfall or flow through a dam. A drawback of dams is that they flood land upstream. They can also reduce water flow downstream. Either effect may harm ecosystems. Wind Wind is moving air. It has kinetic energy that can do work. Wind turbines change the kinetic energy of the wind to electrical energy. Only certain areas of the world get enough steady wind. Many people also think that wind turbines are noisy and not very nice to look at.  Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Sunlight, waterfall , wind\\" correctly answer the question \\"What are some forms of renewable energy listed in the paragraph?\\"?","output":"Yes, the response \\"Sunlight, waterfall, wind\\" correctly answers the question \\"What are some forms of renewable energy listed in the paragraph?\\" as these are the three main sources of renewable energy mentioned in the paragraph: 1.

Question: What is the name of the girl? Movie title: The StÃ¶ned Age Movie plot: In the opening scene, \\"Crump's brother\\" is hitchhiking on a busy highway. After a few cars pass him by, Crump's brother recognizes and yells at a long-haired teen in an old Ford pickup who screeches to a stop to pick him up. Crump's brother is obviously a tough guy. He tells the driver about two girls he knows about in Torrance Beach that he's planning to spend the night with. Later that day at Petro Park, a hangout in Orange County, the driver of the pickup tells some other dudes (known as \\"the guzzlers\\"), about the two girls. Tack, one of the guzzlers, walks away from the others, obviously on some sort of mission. We can only wonder what he's up to as the opening credits roll.During the title sequence we meet Joe (Michael Kopelow) and Hubbs (Bradford Tatum), two typical long-haired teens who are bombing around in their 1960s Volkswagen Type II Squareback, The \\"Blue Torpedo\\". They're looking to party, but there isn't much going on. As if to emphasize the point, Joe's 8-track copy of \\"Hocus Pocus\\" by Focus is eaten by the tape deck. He then puts on \\"Don't Fear The Reaper\\" by Blue Öyster Cult, but Hubbs calls it a \\"pussy song\\" and orders him to take it out. Joe counters by saying: \\"If it's B.O.C. how can it be pussy?\\", but Hubbs doesn't want to hear it, and grabs Joe in a headlock until he complies.They make a stop to chat up the homely \\"Buffalo Chicks\\" and get the lowdown on the evening's parties. Then, cruising once again, they pass Tack, (played by Clifton Collins Jr. in one of his first film roles), who's trying to flag them down. Joe, at the urging of Hubbs, spits a loogey on Tack as Tack yells out \\"I got some chicks, man!\\". Hubbs shouts: \\"Tack's got some chicks?\\" and screeches to a halt to find out more. After failing to get Tack to reveal what he knows about the chicks, they reluctantly let him into the car.

Answer the following question: This article: Grunge guitarists \\"flatly rejected\\" the virtuoso \\"shredding\\" guitar solos that had become the centerpiece of heavy metal songs, instead opting for melodic, blues-inspired solos – focusing \\"on the song, not the guitar solo\\". Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains stated that solos should be to serve the song, rather than to show off a guitarist's technical skill. In place of the strutting guitar heroes of metal, grunge had \\"guitar anti-heroes\\" like Cobain, who showed little interest in mastering the instrument.In Will Byers' article \\"Grunge committed a crime against music—it killed the guitar solo\\", in The Guardian, he states that while the guitar solo managed to survive through the punk rock era, it was weakened by grunge. He states that when Kurt Cobain played guitar solos that were a restatement of the main vocal melody, fans realized that they did not need to be a Jimi Hendrix-level virtuoso to play the instrument; he says this approach helped to make music feel accessible by fans in a way not seen since the 1960s folk music movement. The producer of Nirvana's Nevermind, Butch Vig, stated that this album and Nirvana \\"killed the guitar solo\\". Soundgarden guitarist Kim Thayil stated he feels in part to be responsible for the \\"death of the guitar solo\\"; he said that his punk rocker aspects made him feel that he did not want to solo, so in the 1980s, he preferred to make noise and do feedback during the guitar solo. Baeble Music calls the grunge guitar solos of the 1990s \\"..raw\\", \\"sloppy\\" and \\"basic\\".Not all sources support the \\"grunge killed the guitar solo\\" argument. Sean Gonzalez states that Pearl Jam has plentiful examples of guitar solos. Michael Azerrad praises the guitar playing of Mudhoney's Steve Turner, calling him the \\"...

As a parent you might never guess how it can benefit your child. It helps your child: Develop Social Skills As children play pretend games,they explore relationships between family members,friends and coworkers and learn more about how people interact.Playing doctors,they imagine how physicians care for their patients.Imaginative play helps develop empathy  with others.If children can imagine how it feels to be left out of a game or to lose a pet,they are better able to help those in need.They become more willing to play fair,to share,and to cooperate. Build Selfconfidence Young children have very little control over their lives.Imagining oneself as a builder of skyscrapers or a super hero defending the planet is inspiring to children.It helps them develop confidence in their abilities and their potential. Promote Intellectual Growth Using imagination is the beginning of abstract thought.Children who can see a king's castle in a mound of sand or a delicious dinner in a mud pie are learning to think symbolically.This skill is important in school where a child will have to learn that numbers symbolize groups of objects,letters symbolize sounds,and so on. Practice Language Skills Kids who pretend with their friends do a lot of talking.This helps increase their vocabulary,improve sentence structure and develop communication skills.

The answer to the question: What is the name of the person whose heartbeat was recorded while they were in the studio, according to Rusko? is inside the article: English-Tamil musician M.I.A. (Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) released her second album Kala in 2007, which achieved widespread critical acclaim, and was certified gold in the United States and silver in the United Kingdom. Six months after giving birth to her son Ikyhd in February 2009, she began composing and recording her third studio album in a home studio section of the Los Angeles house she had bought with her partner Ben Bronfman. She used instruments such as the portable dynamic-phrase synthesizer Korg Kaossilator to compose. She took the beat machine and began recording atop Mayan pyramids in Mexico. Much of the work on the album was undertaken at her house in Los Angeles, in what she called a \\"commune environment\\", before it was completed in a rented studio in Hawaii. She collaborated with writer-producer Blaqstarr because, in her opinion, \\"he simply makes good music\\". M.I.A.'s collaboration with Derek E. Miller of Sleigh Bells on the track \\"Meds and Feds\\" prompted her subsequent signing of the band to her label N.E.E.T., and according to Miller, this experience gave him the confidence to record the band's debut album Treats.Her creative partnership with the comparatively unknown Rusko grew from a sense of frustration at what she saw as her now more mainstream associates suggesting sub-standard tracks due to their busy schedules. Diplo worked on the track \\"Tell Me Why\\", but at a studio in Santa Monica rather than at the house. He claimed in an interview that, following the break-up of his personal relationship with M.I.A. some years earlier, he was not allowed to visit the house because \\"her boyfriend really hates me\\".Tracks for the album were whittled down from recording sessions lasting up to 30 hours. Producer Rusko, who played guitar and piano on the album, described the pair getting \\"carried away\\" in the studio, appreciating the \\"mad distorted and hectic\\" sound they were able to create. Rusko said \\"She's got a kid, a little one year old baby, and we recorded his heart beat. We'd just think of..., can you guess it ?","output":"The name of the person whose heartbeat was recorded while they were in the studio, according to Rusko, is M.I.A.'s son, Ikyhd. The heartbeat recording took place when Ikyhd was a one-year-old baby, and it was incorporated into the composition and recording process for M.I.A.'s third studio album."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. This question has options. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? how do I harvest mint? Choices:  +Right before flowering, cut the stems 1 inch under the ground. You can harvest one mint plant two or three times in one growing season. You can also just pick the leaves as you need them. You can grow the plants indoors for fresh leaves throughout the winter;  +Right before flowering, cut the stems 1 inch from the ground. You can harvest one mint plant two or three times in one growing season. You can also just pick the leaves as you need them. You can grow the plants indoors for fresh leaves throughout the winter;","output":"Both choices provided are excellent ways to harvest mint. Let me expand on each choice with more detailed information: Choice 1: In this method, you harvest the mint right before it starts flowering by cutting the stems 1 inch under the ground. This process involves the following steps: 1. Identify the right time to harvest: The best time to harvest mint is just right before flowering, which typically occurs between late spring and mid-summer, depending on the climate and mint variety. 2. Use clean and sharp shears: Clean and sharpen your cutting tool to ensure that you make a clean and precise cut. This helps minimize stress on the plant and prevents the spread of diseases. 3. Cut the stems 1 inch under the ground: Carefully cut the stems 1 inch below the soil line. This promotes new growth and helps the plant to regenerate quickly.  4. Harvest in the morning: It is ideal to harvest mint plants in the morning, as the essential oils in the leaves are most potent during that time. 5. Rinse and dry the harvested mint: Before use, rinse the mint stems in cold water and gently shake off the excess water. Then, pat the stems dry with clean paper towels or a soft cloth. 6. Regrow your mint plants: Mint plants can be harvested two or three times in a single growing season. As you cut the stems, the plant will continue to grow and produce more leaves. 7. Growing indoors: You can also grow mint plants indoors and use the leaves throughout the winter. These plants grow well in containers or small pots placed near a sunny window. Choice 2: In the second choice, the main difference lies in cutting the stem 1 inch from the ground instead of under the ground. Here are the steps: 1. Follow steps 1-2 of Choice1 to select the right time and prepare your cutting tool. 2. Cut the stems 1 inch from the ground: In this case, cut the stems 1 inch above the soil. This method also promotes the growth of new shoots and allows the mint plant to keep growing after harvest. 3. Follow steps 4-7 from Choice 1 to properly care for your mint post-harvest. Both options are effective, with the main difference being cutting stems slightly below the ground in the first choice, and cutting stems above the ground in the second choice. Neither will harm the plant, and both will encourage healthy regrowth. Ultimately, the option you choose depends on your personal gardening preference."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Explanation: Both sentences describe a scene involving a person and some objects in the background. However, there are significant differences between the elements of each scene. Let's analyze their components: 1. Person: The first sentence describes a young girl, while the second describes a woman. Although both are female, there's a difference in age, making this component dissimilar. 2. Activity / Object Interaction: In the first sentence, the girl is wearing a bike helmet, suggesting she is or will be engaging in a biking activity. In the second sentence, the woman is holding a small dog on a leash, suggesting she is involved in a dog walking activity. This represents a clear difference in actions and objects the person is interacting with. 3. Background Objects: The first sentence has a bicycle in the background, reinforcing the biking theme. The second sentence has chairs in the background, which do not reinforce the dog walking theme nor relate to the bicycle. So, there's no commonality between the two background objects. Considering these differences, the overall similarity score is 1 out of 5, indicating a low level of meaning overlap. The score is not 0 because both sentences describe a scene, share a similar structure, and involve a person; however, the specific details of each scene differ significantly."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\".  Question: What country has nuclear war destroyed? Movie title: The Age of Stupid Movie plot: The film begins in the year 2055, in a world ravaged by catastrophic climate change; London is flooded, Sydney is burning, Las Vegas has been swallowed up by desert, the Amazon rainforest has burnt up, snow has vanished from the Alps, and nuclear war has laid waste to India. An unnamed archivist (Pete Postlethwaite) is entrusted with the safekeeping of humanity's surviving store of art and knowledge. Alone in his vast repository off the coast of the largely ice-free Arctic, he reviews archival footage from back \\"when we could have saved ourselves\\", trying to discern where it all went wrong. Amid news reports of the gathering effects of climate change and global civilization teetering towards destruction, he alights on six stories of individuals whose lives in the early years of the 21st century seem to illustrate aspects of the impending catastrophe. These six stories take the form of interweaving documentary segments that report on the lives of real people around the year 2008 and switch the film's narrative form from fiction to fact. In addition to the framing narrative in 2055, the news clips and the documentary footage of the six personal stories, the films includes animated segments and brief interviews with Mark Lynas and George Monbiot, created for the film.[citation needed]","output":"I can certainly help answer questions about the film proposal and provide some insights for you to consider before investing.

Relevance and Appeal: The movie deals with climate change and the catastrophic impact it has on the world. This topic is highly relevant in today's global context, and the film may resonate with audiences who are concerned about the environment and the effects of climate change. With the increasing awareness around these issues, the film has the potential to draw a substantial audience. 2. Unique storytelling approach: The film combines various elements such as futuristic fiction, documentary, news clips, and interviews. This unique storytelling approach may appeal to a broader audience and keep them engaged throughout the runtime.

Strong emotional impact: By exploring six different personal stories, the movie aims to create a strong emotional connection with viewers.

Marketability and distribution opportunities: The topical nature of the film's subject matter may lead to various marketing and distribution opportunities, including partnerships with environmental organizations, educational institutions, or even governments that support climate change initiatives.

Risk and potential returns: As with any film investment, there are risks involved. The movie's success will depend on numerous factors such as the effectiveness of the storytelling, the quality of the production, and the reception from critics and audiences.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerceâs âSave the Senateâ effort is being led by both Republicans who back the partyâs presumptive presidential nominee, Donald Trump, and those who have balked at doing so, in a shared quest to retain the Senate majority. The Chamberâs coalition highlights how much easier it is for Republicans to rally around congressional races this year than to join forces in the divisive presidential election. Republicans âare all over the board on the presidential race, but thereâs a lot of unanimity when it comes to the Senate,â said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), an honorary co-chairman and fundraiser for the Chamberâs push. Mr. Graham, who ended his own presidential campaign in December, hasnât endorsed Mr. Trump. The initiative has no specified fundraising goal. âWeâre going to raise as much as we can to be competitive between now and election day,â said Scott Reed, the Chamberâs senior political strategist.

WSJ STORIES YOU SHOULDN’T MISS TRUMP HOPES FOR BOOST FROM SANDERS SUPPORTERS: Donald Trump, surveying the next phase of his Republican presidential campaign, is counting on a boost from an untapped well of disenchanted voters who hate the status quo, think the system is stacked against them and canât stand Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. That would be some supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders. âIâm hearing weâre going to get close to 40% of his supporters,â Mr. Trump said at a recent campaign rally in Albuquerque, N.M. âThe system is rigged against Bernie, so he canât winâ in the Democratic presidential primary. âWeâre going to get tremendous numbers from Bernie Sanders.â But making that prediction come true would require an extraordinary amount of persuasion, if recent opinion polls and interviews with Sanders backers are any indication. Janet Hook reports. ECONOMIC SCARS HELP EXPLAIN BIZARRE 2016 RACE: The search for an explanation of this yearâs bizarre political climate leads to a basic conclusion: The recession that started in 2007 and the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 scared and scarred the electorate more deeply and more permanently than has been recognized before. Yes, the economic statistics say thereâs been a recoveryâa relatively nice one at that. But mentally, many Americans have never recovered, and perhaps never will. The experience has altered their attitudes about the political and economic systems and their leaders, and left them willing to consider risky alternatives. What the country is experiencing âis the difference between a car crash and having your house burn down,â says Democratic pollster Peter Hart. âA car crash is something that fades as the three or six months mark goes by. Your house burning down is never forgotten. It is always there and there is no half-life.â Read Washington bureau chief Gerald F. Seibâs full Capital Journal column.

WHAT WE’RE READING AROUND THE WEB Bernard Avishai of The New Yorker writes that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may pay a price for appointing controversial hardliner Avigdor Lieberman his new defense minister, a move that has angered the leaders of the nation’s armed forces: “Netanyahu may keep power for a while, but in losing the Army he has lost a major source of his legitimacy.” Ben Brody of Bloomberg looks at a string of Republican politicians who have come around to Donald Trump’s side: “As the presumptive nominee, Trump, 69, has found increasing support, even among some Republican leaders who had earlier declared themselves completely opposed to his brash bid.” The Atlantic’s Ron Brownstein writes thatÂ “the history in both parties is that primary wounds eventually get healed. But with Trump stirring in these early polls, that healing process can’t start too soon to soothe the nerves of anxious Democrats.” Juan Williams writes in the HillÂ thatÂ “one fundamental thing separates Trumpâs fans and critics: Whether they have taken the time to apply even the slightest scrutiny to what he says and does.” FEEDBACK:Â The Capital Journal Daybreak newsletter is The Wall Street Journal’s morning rundown of the biggest news stories and exclusive features from Washington on politics, policy, financial regulation, defense and more.

She wore a wig for starters, and a very good one. It was light brown and shoulder length. It looked so natural that if he didn't know she had much shorter hair, he would have guessed that she had dyed it. But it was the outfit that made the change. She wore a well-tailored, very professional, gray woman's skirt/blazer combo with a yellow silk blouse. Her wrist sported what looked to Paul's uneducated eye like an expensive and fashionable gold lady's watch from which he thought he detected a glint of diamond. In short, she looked just like the high priced lawyer she was supposed to be. She was certainly the best-dressed person in the room. Chloe reached across the table to shake Greg's hand, stretching forward as she did so. Paul watched Greg glance down at her cleavage while he shook her hand. \\"I'm Rachel Roth, here on behalf of Mr. Paul Reynolds.\\" \\"Hi,\\" said Greg. \\"I'm Greg Driscol, and this is...\\" \\"I know the rogues gallery here,\\" said Chloe cutting Greg off and looking around at the assembled board members. \\"I've learned all about you gentlemen.\\" Marie stood up and shook Chloe's hand. \\"Marie Cooper, from Johnson, Myers, and Wick,\\" she said. \\"Nice to meet you,\\" she said. \\"Ok, we've got the intros down, shall we get on with the dirty business?\\" \\"Um, sure,\\" Greg said as he sat back down. \\"I was just about to turn things over to Marie.\\" The plan was now in action, and so far so good. But Paul knew that this was a crucial moment. Chloe didn't really know the law - just a few points that her friend had helped her out with. She couldn't let the real lawyer take over the meeting. Her dramatic, unexpected entrance had them off guard, and Paul hoped she seized the moment and pressed on. Who is Greg Driscol?  A. Paul's step-brother and competitor in the family business  B.

I read this background article the other day: Hepatitis viruses can develop into a chronic viral infection that leads to liver cancer.

Hint: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Mathew will have bigger muscles. This is because Mathew goes to the gym 5 times a week and does very intensive workouts, which involve using his skeletal muscles against a resisting force, such as weight lifting. This kind of exercise increases muscle size and strength. On the other hand, Damen does not go to the gym at all and lives a mostly sedentary lifestyle, which does not involve regular exercise to maintain muscle size and strength. The paragraph suggests that \\"use it or lose it\\" principle applies to muscles, so Mathew's consistent exercise routine would contribute to having bigger and stronger muscles as compared to Damen, who does not exercise regularly."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Abstract: During meiosis I, kinetochores of sister chromatids are juxtaposed or fused and mono-orient, while homologous chromosomes that are paired by chiasmata (bivalents) have to biorient. In the absence of chiasmata, biorientation of sister chromatids (univalents), which carries a risk of aneuploidy, has been occasionally detected in several species, including humans. We show in fission yeast that biorientation of fused sister kinetochores predominates during early prometaphase I. Without chiasmata, this undesirable biorientation of univalents persists and eventually evades the spindle assembly checkpoint, provoking abnormal anaphase. When univalents are connected by chiasmata or by an artificial tether, this erroneous attachment is converted to monopolar attachment and stabilized. This stabilization is apparently achieved by a chromosome configuration that brings kinetochores to the outer edge of the bivalent, while bringing Aurora B, a destabilizer of kinetochore-microtubule attachment, inward. Our results elucidate how chiasmata favor biorientation of bivalents over that of univalents at meiosis I..

The robot, Emma (Leslie Bibb), takes a jack-o'-lantern to blow out the light but her boyfriend, Henry (Tahmoh Penikett), tells her that it's against tradition to un-decorate before midnight. Emma asserts that she wants all the decorations gone before her mother visits the next morning, saying that the yard looks like a crime scene, and blows out the candle. Henry, a true fan of the holiday, promises to remove everything early the next morning and convinces Emma to meet him inside for some \\"alone time\\". While he goes in to \\"put on the tape\\", Emma starts to take down some of the decorations down, uttering the unforgivable \\"I hate Halloween\\". As she removes the sheets off one of the ghost-crows, it lunges at her, covering her in the white cloth. In the ensuing struggle, Emma tumbles onto the sidewalk where passing trick-or-treaters stop to investigate. Under the sheets, a figure takes a bitten pumpkin-shaped sucker and slits Emma's throat. Her blood stains through the sheets and the children run away. The hidden assailant drags Emma's body back to the yard as Henry lies upstairs, passed out and with the TV on high volume. Some time later, he notices Emma has not come up and goes down to the yard where he notices that one of the ghost-crows now has lights attached to it.

Sentence: \\"Give a fresh coat of paint to the front door.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically? Options: +unacceptable +acceptable","output":"+acceptable A linguist would most likely rate this sentence as acceptable linguistically. In order to understand the reasoning behind this assessment, it is essential to examine the sentence based on the key aspects of linguistics, which include syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. Syntax refers to the rules that govern the structure of a sentence, and in English, this typically involves a clear arrangement of the sentence elements, such as the subject, verb, and object. In the given sentence, \\"Give a fresh coat of paint to the front door,\\" the syntax is correct. The sentence has a clear subject (implied \\"you\\" as the person being addressed), a verb (\\"give\\"), and an object (\\"a fresh coat of paint\\"). Additionally, the prepositional phrase \\"to the front door\\" provides the necessary information about the location in which the action should be performed. Semantics deals with the meaning behind the words and phrases used in a sentence. In this instance, the meaning of the sentence is quite clear. The speaker is directing someone to paint the front door in a new color or fresh finish by providing a new layer of paint. Each word in the sentence contributes to conveying the overall meaning without any ambiguity or unintended interpretations. Pragmatics considers the context in which a sentence is used and how context affects the meaning and acceptability of a sentence. In this case, the given sentence is appropriate for a variety of communication settings. It could serve as an instruction given by a homeowner to a professional painter, a suggestion between neighbors, or even as part of a \\"to-do\\" list for home improvement. The sentence is versatile and context-appropriate, which makes it an acceptable sentence from a pragmatic perspective as well. In conclusion, the sentence \\"Give a fresh coat of paint to the front door\\" would be deemed linguistically acceptable by a linguist, considering the aspects of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. This sentence demonstrates proper structure and word order, has a clear and coherent meaning, and is well-suited to a range of communication contexts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To understand the relationship between the two, let's break down the given statement. It suggests that a key principle in Baptist tradition is that local Baptist Churches operate independently and possess self-governance. In other words, they manage their own affairs without a central authority directing their actions. This notion aligns with the Baptist belief in the autonomy of local churches, allowing each congregation to determine its particular practices and doctrines based on the Bible's teachings. Now, the additional part of the statement argues that referring to Baptists as a denomination might be somewhat inconsistent, given their commitments to local church autonomy. A denomination typically refers to a religious group that shares unified doctrines, practices, and structures. However, because Baptist churches are self-governing and independent, they might not always have uniform practices or perspectives on matters of faith. This diversity makes it less accurate to label them as a single denomination, which implies a more rigid organizational structure. In conclusion, the provided statement contains the answer to the question at hand. The primary Baptist principle asserts that local Baptist Churches are both independent and self-governing, emphasizing autonomy and the freedom of each congregation to define its path guided by the Bible. The term \\"Baptist denomination\\" might not capture this emphasis on local church autonomy as it implies a more unified and centralized organizational structure.

Article: Health officials issued a waring over common energy-saving lghtbulbs  after research showed some types could potentially harm the skin and may even raise the risk of cancer. A study by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) found that some eco-friendly lightbuulbs release levels of ultraviolet (UV)   radiation that are above recognized safety limits. The agency urged people who work with lamps nearby to avoid spending more than one hour within a foot of the eco-friendly bulbs. The warning was directed at those using desk lamps for long periods, such as jewellery makers, and others who might have lights close to their faces, such as car mechanics. John O'Hagan, a scientist at the HPA's centre for radiation, chemical and environmental dangers, began tests on the ligthbulbs after patient groups raised concern about them. Among the groups were patients with a skin disease called lupus, which makes people highly sensitive to light. The tests measured UV light from the lamps and found the highest levels of UV radiation, measured 2cm from the lightbulbs, were _ to being outside in direct sunlight in the summer. The most immediate risk from the lightbulbs is a reddening of the skin similar to sunburn, but there is also a small increased risk of skin cancer associated with this, again similar to that of sunburn. The risk of health problems from the lightbulbs was not so high that people should remove them from their homes. People are advised to avoid using open lightbulbs for long close work until the problem is sorted out. It has confirmed that the government will not be reviewing its strategy on introducing energy efficient lightbulbs. Question: We can learn from the passage that   _  .

The Great Migration brought rural blacks from the South; they were outnumbered by southern whites who also migrated to the city. Immigration brought southern and eastern Europeans of Catholic and Jewish faith; these new groups competed with native-born whites for jobs and housing in the booming city.

So whether you prefer your lips sheer and glossy or pigmented and matte there should be something for everyone here. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil – this is the first lip pencil that I’ve tried from MAC (apart from lip liner) and I’m really impressed with it. As the name suggests the finish is a very shiny gloss that gives an almost patent shine, it has the feel of a lip gloss but it’s not sticky. The colour is called Spontaneous, MAC describe it as a ‘soft plum with pearl’. It’s definitely a plummy shade, although I can’t really detect any pearl in there. It looks quite dark as a crayon but as it’s very sheer it appears much more natural once it’s on the lips. It’s a great way to introduce darker lip colours to your make-up bag if you’re not used to them. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil is a bit like a fabulous giant tinted lip balm! The crayon itself is chunky and easy to hold, the nib is quite chunky and not great for precision application, but you could use a lip brush to apply it.

He spent most of his life in the United Kingdom, working as an academic for the University of Edinburgh and then the Institute of Archaeology, London, and wrote twenty-six books during his career. Initially an early proponent of culture-historical archaeology, he later became the first exponent of Marxist archaeology in the Western world. Born in Sydney to a middle-class English migrant family, Childe studied classics at the University of Sydney before moving to England to study classical archaeology at the University of Oxford. There, he embraced the socialist movement and campaigned against the First World War, viewing it as a conflict waged by competing imperialists to the detriment of Europe's working class. Returning to Australia in 1917, he was prevented from working in academia because of his socialist activism, instead working for the Labor Party as the private secretary of the politician John Storey. Growing critical of Labor, he wrote an analysis of their policies and joined the far-left Industrial Workers of the World. Emigrating to London in 1921, he became librarian of the Royal Anthropological Institute and journeyed across Europe to pursue his research into the continent's prehistory, publishing his findings in academic papers and books. In doing so he introduced the continental European concept of an archaeological culture—the idea that a recurring assemblage of artefacts demarcates a distinct cultural group—to the British archaeological community.

We need to know exactly why the pilot was flying where he was, at that height, so close to the road. \\"Do we just need to change the [flight] pattern, do we need not to have certain types of very powerful and also quite old vintage aircraft? \\"Is it not suitable for those type of aircraft? I don't know.\\" He added: \\"People are keen not to rush to judgement. The Shoreham Airshow is a very popular part of the Shoreham calendar, it's been going very safely for the past 26 years and I hope we can retain it in some form.\\" Two days after the crash on 22 August, the Civil Aviation Authority banned vintage jets from performing high-energy aerobatics over land at air shows, limiting them to flypasts only. It also grounded all Hawker Hunter jets until further notice. An initial Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) report found the Hawker Hunter jet showed \\"no abnormal indications\\" during its flight. It also said pilot Andy Hill was thrown clear of the aircraft during the later part of the crash but it was not clear whether he initiated his ejection. The Royal Air Forces Association (RAFA), which organises Shoreham Airshow, said it continued to \\"provide the authorities with our full cooperation and support in their endeavours to find all the answers\\" to the \\"tragedy at Shoreham\\".

U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday blasted former FBI director James Comey as an \\"untruthful slime ball,\\" and said it was his \\"great honor\\" to fire him.  Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week.  The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey.  The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles.  Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book.  Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump...

Options：  A. burned  B. polished  C. carved  D. composted  E. nailed A:","output":"B. polished You would be most likely to see your reflection in a piece of wood when it has been polished. Polishing a wooden surface can significantly improve its reflectiveness by smoothing out its rough texture and adding a glossy finish. The polished surface allows light to bounce off more uniformly, allowing you to see a reflection. Here's a more detailed explanation for why the other options are not suitable: A. Burned: Burning a piece of wood creates charred, blackened areas that are not ideal for reflecting light. These darkened areas typically have an uneven surface and have poor reflectivity, making it difficult to see a clear reflection. C. Carved: Carving a wooden surface usually results in intricate shapes and patterns which disrupt the uniformity of the surface, causing light to scatter in different directions. This makes it difficult to see a clear reflection in carved wood. D. Composted: Composting a piece of wood means that it is broken down by microorganisms into smaller components to create nutrient-rich soil. As a result, the wood ceases to exist in solid form, and you'll not be able to see your reflection in any manner. E. Nailed: Nailing a piece of wood refers to securing it with nails, which does not affect the wood's reflective properties directly. The reflective nature of the wood depends on the surface finish, and nails do not contribute to this aspect. In conclusion, the most suitable option for seeing your reflection in a piece of wood is when the wood has been polished. A polished wooden surface possesses a smooth and glossy finish, which allows light to reflect off its surface more uniformly and creates a mirror-like effect."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The fee for this lifesaving miracle? The aliens want a glass of water. However, the Russians, along with a rogue element in the FBI, would like to get to the aliens first because they have also offered something called the \\"Big Gun\\" - a gun so big that it could destroy a planet.

However, Wilson is no agent, having been easily pushed around by a group of bullies who lived down the street, and by a milkman who was trying to seduce his wife. Pirandello is unconventional, and likes to do things his way. He meets Wilson at Wilson's home, with Russian agents close on his tail.

Please briefly summarize this news article: No Letup on the Right to Choose Wendy Davis, a Texas state senator, got national attention last week for her marathon filibuster against an extremist package of abortion restrictions. Ms. Davisâs dramatic gesture is unlikely to stop the hard-right Texas Legislature from passing the bill, and there are many similar measures around the country that are part of a nonstop attack on womenâs reproductive rights by Republican lawmakers and anti-abortion groups. But her uprising, which shot around the country on Twitter and the rest of the social Web, showed that Democrats can fight back against the anti-abortion-rights campaign. It is already showing signs of revitalizing a somnambulant Texas Democratic Party, and it should inspire abortion-rights advocates everywhere. Last Tuesday, talking for more than 11 hours, Ms. Davis actually blocked passage of the new abortion restrictions by essentially running out the clock on a special legislative session. Her victory may prove to be short-lived. Texasâs Republican governor, Rick Perry, has called another special session beginning on Monday to try to resurrect the bill. The measure, a grab bag of constitutionally dubious ideas from other places, would give Texas one of the strictest abortion laws in the nation, and that is saying a lot these days. If enacted, it would ban abortions at 20 weeks post-fertilization; there would be no rape exception, and a narrow physical health exception would jeopardize womenâs lives by requiring risk to a âmajor bodily functionâ before a woman could terminate a pregnancy. Other provisions would require abortion clinics to meet the same standards as hospital-style surgical centers, including specifications for parking spaces and janitorsâ closets, and mandate that a doctor who performs abortions have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. These medically unnecessary rules could result in the closing of all but 5 of 42 clinics in the state that now provide abortion services. In other parts of the country, supposedly âsmall-governmentâ Republicans are mandating government interference with a womanâs personal and complex childbearing decisions. Some 40 new abortion restrictions have been enacted so far this year in 13 states, according to the Guttmacher Institute. In New York, legislators defeated a measure proposed by the Democratic governor, Andrew Cuomo, that essentially would have enshrined the reproductive rights guaranteed by Roe v. Wade into state law. In Ohio, an egregious measure tucked into the state budget would bar a public hospital from entering into an agreement to take emergency patients from abortion clinics, which are required under state law to have such an agreement. In Washington, the Republican majority in the House of Representatives voted for a federal 20-week abortion ban, a present to the partyâs right flank that, fortunately, stands to go nowhere in the Democratic-led Senate. Wendy Davisâs filibuster is a reminder of the need for engagement by elected officials and voters to prevent further restrictions that trample on the rights and health of women. With so many damaging restrictions already on the books, though, much also depends on the courts to do their job and insist on respect for existing constitutional protections. That includes the Supreme Court, which has tentatively accepted a case for next term testing the validity of Oklahomaâs effective ban on a safe and common first-trimester abortion method that uses prescription medication. Summary:","output":"Texas State Senator Wendy Davis gained national attention for her filibuster against a package of abortion restrictions. The measure would give Texas one of the strictest abortion laws in the nation, banning abortions at 20 weeks post-fertilization with no rape exception. Other provisions could result in the closing of 37 out of 42 clinics providing abortion services in the state. While Davis's filibuster may not stop the bill, it demonstrates that Democrats can challenge such measures and has inspired abortion-rights advocates."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., answers a question during his appearance with the Public Policy Institute of California in Sacramento, Calif. Frustration and finger-pointing... (Associated Press)      WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican Kevin McCarthy easily won an internal party election Wednesday to take over the shrunken House GOP caucus, a familiar role for the underestimated scrapper whose top priority will be to protect President Donald Trump's agenda and try to build the party back to retake the majority.      The speaker's gavel long gone, the race for minority leader was McCarthy's to lose, but the Californian's rise was never guaranteed. He's close to Trump, but the president is also friendly with Rep. Jim Jordan, the conservative Freedom Caucus member, and both faced testy colleagues ready to assign blame after the midterm election losses.      In the end, McCarthy pushed past Jordan, 159-43, according to officials familiar with the closed-door voting.      McCarthy \\"knows what he needs to do,\\" said GOP Whip Steve Scalise, the Louisiana Republican who was gravely wounded in last year's congressional baseball practice shooting and unanimously won the No. 2 spot as minority whip.      \\"You always look in the mirror and see what you can do better,\\" Scalise said Tuesday. Republicans, he said, \\"need to do a better job of letting people know what we stand for.\\"      Theirs was the marquee contest as senators also chose new leaders, but House Democrats put off until after Thanksgiving the biggest contest, Rep. Nancy Pelosi's bid to return as her party's nominee for speaker.      On the other side of the Capitol, senators chose Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for another term leading Republicans and Chuck Schumer for Democrats in closed-door party elections that lacked the drama of the House contest.      Both McConnell and Schumer were chosen as leader by acclamation, according to those familiar with the private caucus meetings. McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who expanded GOP ranks in last week's midterm, faced no opponent. Democrats returned Schumer's entire leadership team, despite the failure to capture the majority in the midterms.      Senate Republicans also welcomed the first woman to their leadership team in years, Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, as they sought to address the optics of the GOP side of the aisle being dominated by men.      Ernst called her selection to the leadership ranks \\"a great honor.\\"      During a brief photo op in McConnell's Capitol office ahead of voting, McConnell presented his newly elected senators who will take their seats in January.      Among them was Florida's Rick Scott, the Republican governor whose race against incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson remains undecided. McConnell said later he was confident Scott would become the 53rd senator in the GOP majority.      Schumer said Trump is lying about voter fraud in Florida's election and remained confident Nelson would return as Florida's senator, as long as every vote was counted.      \\"President Trump and Gov. Scott have just lied,\\" Schumer said. \\"They've said there's fraud when their own Republican officials in Florida have said there's no fraud.\\"      Schumer portrayed Senate Democrats as emboldened, despite midterm losses, by an election he characterized as a rejection of the GOP tax cuts and Republican efforts to end the Affordable Care Act.      Even in the minority, Schumer said Senate Democrats will push for the party's broader congressional agenda of lowering health care costs, investing in infrastructure and implementing good government reforms to put a check on the Trump administration, which he called \\"the most ethically challenged in history.\\"      \\"We will be relentless here in the Senate,\\" said Schumer, flanked by his leadership team. \\"Senate Democrats are committed to fighting to make those ideas a reality in this upcoming Congress.\\"      Trump has stayed largely on the sidelines ahead of elections that will determine party leadership.      The contest between McCarthy and Jordan reflected the split between the GOP's conservative flank, whose numbers are bolstered after the election, and what remains of the centrists. It will continue to challenge the new leader.      Jordan's entire campaign was built on the premise, lawmakers said, that Republicans lost because they didn't \\"do what we said\\" — including on Trump's priorities to build the border wall with Mexico.      On Wednesday, Jordan told \\"Fox & Friends\\" the GOP lost its House majority because it didn't deliver on promises to Americans to secure the U.S.-Mexico border, fund Trump's wall and replace the Obama health care law.      \\"Some key things we told them we were going to do, we didn't,\\" Jordan said.      The Ohio Republican, though, was always considered a longshot, and his run was viewed as a way to assert a greater role for the conservatives and the Freedom Caucus at the leadership table.      Conservatives have long promoted Jordan for the ranking member position on a top House committee, including the Judiciary panel, where Democrats plan multiple investigations into Trump's businesses and administration.      Most GOP lawmakers, though, preferred McCarthy's more affable approach to running the often unruly conference.      Rounding out the GOP leadership team will be Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, a daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, who wants to bring a more aggressive stance to the GOP's communications and messaging strategy in the No. 3 spot.      In the lead-up to Wednesday's election, McCarthy and Jordan encountered frustration, finger-pointing and questions as lawmakers sorted through an election defeat and began considering new leadership for the next congressional session.      Republicans complained about the unpopularity of the GOP tax law they blamed for losses in New York and other key states, some attendees told reporters after the meeting. Some in the meeting said Republicans should have tried harder to fulfill Trump's priorities, like funding for the wall with Mexico. They also warned that they need a new fundraising mechanism to compete with the small-dollar online donors that powered Democrats to victory.      \\"There's a little rawness still,\\" Rep. Mark Walker, R-N.C., who is running unopposed for a down-ballot position as vice chair of the GOP conference, told reporters outside the meeting room. \\"But there's an opportunity for us to come together and get single-focused on the message.\\"      On the Democratic side, Pelosi remains she's confident she'll have enough support to win when voting gets underway after Thanksgiving, and challenged her opponents Wednesday to put forward an alternative candidate.      \\"Come on in, the water's warm,\\" Pelosi said.      ___      Associated Press writers Matthew Daly, Kevin Freking, Laurie Kellman and Alan Fram in Washington contributed to this report.      ___      Follow on Twitter at https://twitter.com/lisamascaro and AP's political coverage at https://apnews.com/apf-politics      ___ ||||| FILE - IN this Aug. 15, 2018, file photo, Rep.

(Associated Press)      WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican Kevin McCarthy easily won an internal party election Wednesday to take over the shrunken House GOP caucus, a familiar role for the underestimated scrapper whose top priority will be to protect President Donald Trump's agenda and try to build the party back to retake the majority.      The speaker's gavel long gone, the race for minority leader was McCarthy's to lose, but the Californian's rise was never guaranteed. He's close to Trump, but the president is also friendly with Rep. Jim Jordan, the conservative Freedom Caucus member, and both faced testy colleagues ready to assign blame after the midterm election losses.      In the end, McCarthy pushed past Jordan, 159-43, according to officials familiar with the closed-door voting.      McCarthy \\"knows what he needs to do,\\" said GOP Whip Steve Scalise, the Louisiana Republican who was gravely wounded in last year's congressional baseball practice shooting and unanimously won the No. 2 spot as minority whip.      \\"You always look in the mirror and see what you can do better,\\" Scalise said Tuesday. Republicans, he said, \\"need to do a better job of letting people know what we stand for.\\"      Theirs was the marquee contest as senators also chose new leaders, but House Democrats put off until after Thanksgiving the biggest contest, Rep. Nancy Pelosi's bid to return as her party's nominee for speaker.      On the other side of the Capitol, senators chose Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for another term leading Republicans and Chuck Schumer for Democrats in closed-door party elections that lacked the drama of the House contest.      Both McConnell and Schumer were chosen as leader by acclamation, according to those familiar with the private caucus meetings. McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who expanded GOP ranks in last week's midterm, faced no opponent. Democrats returned Schumer's entire leadership team, despite the failure to capture the majority in the midterms.      Senate Republicans also welcomed the first woman to their leadership team in years, Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, as they sought to address the optics of the GOP side of the aisle being dominated by men.      Ernst called her selection to the leadership ranks \\"a great honor.\\"      During a brief photo op in McConnell's Capitol office ahead of voting, McConnell presented his newly elected senators who will take their seats in January.      Among them was Florida's Rick Scott, the Republican governor whose race against incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson remains undecided. McConnell said later he was confident Scott would become the 53rd senator in the GOP majority.      Schumer said Trump is lying about voter fraud in Florida's election and remained confident Nelson would return as Florida's senator, as long as every vote was counted.      \\"President Trump and Gov. Scott have just lied,\\" Schumer said. \\"They've said there's fraud when their own Republican officials in Florida have said there's no fraud.\\"      Schumer portrayed Senate Democrats as emboldened, despite midterm losses, by an election he characterized as a rejection of the GOP tax cuts and Republican efforts to end the Affordable Care Act.      Even in the minority, Schumer said Senate Democrats will push for the party's broader congressional agenda of lowering health care costs, investing in infrastructure and implementing good government reforms to put a check on the Trump administration, which he called \\"the most ethically challenged in history.\\"      \\"We will be relentless here in the Senate,\\" said Schumer, flanked by his leadership team. \\"Senate Democrats are committed to fighting to make those ideas a reality in this upcoming Congress.\\"      Trump has stayed largely on the sidelines ahead of elections that will determine party leadership.      The contest between McCarthy and Jordan reflected the split between the GOP's conservative flank, whose numbers are bolstered after the election, and what remains of the centrists. It will continue to challenge the new leader.      Jordan's entire campaign was built on the premise, lawmakers said, that Republicans lost because they didn't \\"do what we said\\" — including on Trump's priorities to build the border wall with Mexico.      On Wednesday, Jordan told \\"Fox & Friends\\" the GOP lost its House majority because it didn't deliver on promises to Americans to secure the U.S.-Mexico border, fund Trump's wall and replace the Obama health care law.      \\"Some key things we told them we were going to do, we didn't,\\" Jordan said.      The Ohio Republican, though, was always considered a longshot, and his run was viewed as a way to assert a greater role for the conservatives and the Freedom Caucus at the leadership table.      Conservatives have long promoted Jordan for the ranking member position on a top House committee, including the Judiciary panel, where Democrats plan multiple investigations into Trump's businesses and administration.      Most GOP lawmakers, though, preferred McCarthy's more affable approach to running the often unruly conference.      Rounding out the GOP leadership team will be Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, a daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, who wants to bring a more aggressive stance to the GOP's communications and messaging strategy in the No. 3 spot.      In the lead-up to Wednesday's election, McCarthy and Jordan encountered frustration, finger-pointing and questions as lawmakers sorted through an election defeat and began considering new leadership for the next congressional session.      Republicans complained about the unpopularity of the GOP tax law they blamed for losses in New York and other key states, some attendees told reporters after the meeting. Some in the meeting said Republicans should have tried harder to fulfill Trump's priorities, like funding for the wall with Mexico. They also warned that they need a new fundraising mechanism to compete with the small-dollar online donors that powered Democrats to victory.      \\"There's a little rawness still,\\" Rep. Mark Walker, R-N.C., who is running unopposed for a down-ballot position as vice chair of the GOP conference, told reporters outside the meeting room. \\"But there's an opportunity for us to come together and get single-focused on the message.\\"      On the Democratic side, Pelosi remains she's confident she'll have enough support to win when voting gets underway after Thanksgiving, and challenged her opponents Wednesday to put forward an alternative candidate.      \\"Come on in, the water's warm,\\" Pelosi said.      ___      Associated Press writers Matthew Daly, Kevin Freking, Laurie Kellman and Alan Fram in Washington contributed to this report.      ___      Follow on Twitter at https://twitter.com/lisamascaro and AP's political coverage at https://apnews.com/apf-politics      ___ ||||| Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) has vowed to help lead Republicans back to the majority in 2020. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO Congress McCarthy hits hard at Dems after winning minority leader post The California Republican easily defeated conservative hard-liner Jim Jordan.      House Republicans immediately resumed a wartime posture Wednesday after electing their new leadership — vowing to aggressively resist Democrats' agenda and work to recapture the House majority after being routed in last week's elections.      In his first news conference after Republicans chose him to be House minority leader next year, Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) largely attributed the GOP wipeout to historical trends while also repeatedly blaming spending by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg as the cause of several Republican defeats in close contests.      Story Continued Below      And rather than offer any conciliatory words to Democratic leaders, McCarthy and his newly appointed leadership team said they intend to retake the House in 2020 and push back against a Democratic agenda they described as primarily aimed at unseating President Donald Trump.      \\"I know they want to abolish ICE. I know they want to impeach the president,\\" McCarthy said. \\"I just don’t think that’s the agenda Americans want.\\"      McCarthy's comments came shortly after his colleagues and incoming GOP freshmen elected him to be the top House Republican in next year's Congress, easily casting aside a challenge for the post from conservative firebrand Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio).      Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

McCarthy got 159 votes to Jordan’s 43 in the members-only session, according to Republican sources in the room.      The victory sealed McCarthy's yearslong drive to rise to the top of the House Republican Conference, an effort derailed by Jordan and the conservative House Freedom Caucus in 2015. Back then, McCarthy was running for speaker but ran into opposition from the Freedom Caucus and withdrew his name from consideration. That cleared the way for Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to become speaker.      Ryan announced in April he would retire from the House; amid intense jockeying behind the scenes to replace him, McCarthy consistently remained the front-runner.      House Republicans also filled out the rest of their leadership team for the new Congress with few surprises.      Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana will be minority whip, and Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming — a rising star in the party and daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney — will be Republican Conference chairwoman. Rep. Mark Walker of North Carolina will be vice chair and Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota will chair the National Republican Campaign Committee. Rep. Gary Palmer of Alabama will lead the Republican Policy Committee. Palmer is the first member of the Freedom Caucus to capture a leadership role.      Following McCarthy's comments, Cheney gave a nod to the GOP's struggles among women and minorities. She insisted that Republicans would \\"take a back seat to no one\\" when it comes to \\"doing what's right for America's women, America's minorities.\\"      McCarthy also acknowledged Republicans' struggles in the suburbs.      \\"We took a beating inside the suburban areas,\\" he said, adding, \\"Our ideas are going to have to be stronger.\\"      McCarthy’s victory is a bittersweet one, coming as Republicans prepare to hand the speaker's gavel back to Democrats for the first time in eight years.      Dragged down by history and Trump’s dismal poll numbers, Democrats enjoyed their biggest House victory since the Watergate scandal of the 1970s. Democrats are on track to gain 35 to 40 seats, including a slew in McCarthy’s home state of California, where an already small number of Republican House members saw their ranks shrink dramatically.      McCarthy didn't mention Trump in his remarks after the leadership elections, instead alluding to him only when asked about the reason for GOP losses. He criticized Democrats for what he said seemed to be a plan to impeach the president, though Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi has rebuffed the notion. He also sidestepped a question about whether Trump's unpopularity and divisive rhetoric hurt Republicans in the elections — saying only that presidents nearly always see their party lose seats in the midterms.      In McCarthy's pitch to the GOP Conference, multiple members said the Californian touted his role in recapturing the House from Democrats back in 2010 — a feat Republicans are now solely focused on repeating.      “I think the consensus was, he could unify us. He helped us win back the majority from Nancy Pelosi once, and we believe he can do it again,” Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas) told reporters.      Multiple GOP veterans left Wednesday’s meeting visibly energized and ready to spar with Democratic leaders.      “We know the Democrats’ base is going to be pushing them toward investigations and impeachments ad nauseam, probably Cabinet officials, maybe a Supreme Court justice, certainly a president,” said Rep. Steve Chabot (R-Ohio), a longtime lawmaker who helped lead the impeachment of President Bill Clinton in 1998. “When they overreach, which I’m sure they will, then I think we should push back and we should push back aggressively,” added Chabot, who is running for the top GOP spot on the House Judiciary Committee.      McCarthy was nominated for the post by House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry, (R-Texas); Reps. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) and Brian Mast (R-Fla.) also spoke in favor.      The California Republican will still have to deal with Jordan, House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and other House conservatives who have made headaches for GOP leaders over the years.      POLITICO reported Tuesday night that Trump urged McCarthy to “make everybody happy” in regard to Jordan, who wants to be ranking member on the Judiciary Committee. However, Jordan is not popular with other House Republicans and may not be able to jump over more senior lawmakers for the Judiciary post.      In his remarks, McCarthy thanked Jordan for running against him but gave little indication of what he expects Jordan's role to be in the next Congress.      Meadows told reporters that he thinks Jordan has earned a look to lead Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, a role that would make him Trump's most prominent defender in any impeachment probe.      Jordan left the vote without speaking to reporters, but Meadows said Jordan was \\"gratified\\" to receive the 43 votes he got. He also said McCarthy would be a \\"good leader\\" and would \\"do his best to bring everybody together.\\"      Asked whether Jordan should be elevated to the top GOP slot on the Judiciary Committee, Meadows added, \\"I think Jim’s earned the position for ranking member on Judiciary. But that’s not my call.\\"      Other Jordan allies on the House Freedom Caucus signaled that they had made peace with McCarthy’s victory, particularly after one of their own won a spot on the GOP leadership team.      “In terms of right now, I think we made the right choice in Kevin,” Palmer told reporters. “When we get the majority back, [Jordan will] chair, and he will be a force to be reckoned with.”       ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Republican Kevin McCarthy has easily won an internal party election to lead the shrunken House GOP caucus.

By 1067 Brycgstow was a well-fortified burh, and that year the townsmen beat off a raiding party from Ireland led by three of Harold Godwinson's sons. Under Norman rule, the town had one of the strongest castles in southern England. Bristol was the place of exile for Diarmait Mac Murchada, the Irish king of Leinster, after being overthrown. The Bristol merchants subsequently played a prominent role in funding Richard Strongbow de Clare and the Norman invasion of Ireland. The port developed in the 11th century around the confluence of the Rivers Frome and Avon, adjacent to Bristol Bridge just outside the town walls. By the 12th century Bristol was an important port, handling much of England's trade with Ireland, including slaves. There was also an important Jewish community in Bristol from the late 12th century through to the late 13th century when all Jews were expelled from England. The stone bridge built in 1247 was replaced by the current bridge during the 1760s. The town incorporated neighbouring suburbs and became a county in 1373, the first town in England to be given this status. During this period, Bristol became a shipbuilding and manufacturing centre. By the 14th century Bristol, York and Norwich were England's largest medieval towns after London. One-third to one-half of the population died in the Black Death of 1348–49, which checked population growth, and its population remained between 10,000 and 12,000 for most of the 15th and 16th centuries. contains an answer for the question: What was the first town in England to be given county status?, what is it ?

The biggest difference is traffic rules. In America there are too much more cars than in China. But there are much fewer traffic jams and accidents in America than in China. We hardly see traffic police in the street, but all cars obey strictly traffic rules, and people hardly find that a car does not obey traffic rules in the street. About American traffic rules, there are many better terms, such as: 1. Stop line: There are stop lines in all crossing without traffic light (some have two stop lines and others have four stop lines). All cars must stop while meeting the stop line. 2. Traffic light: There is traffic light in the crossing of the road. Cars may almost turn every direction. The traffic light can give signal step by step including u-turn. There is a kind of middle lane of turning left. When a car wants to turn left in the road, he may enter into the middle lane of turning left and give a signal of turning left. When he thinks being safe, he may turn left. In many conditions the order of passing is also given very specifically. If people want to change lane or turn, they must look behind and think being safe. Only so, they may do it. 3. Specific item: Such as parking, there are three kinds of lines (their colors are white, blue or red) in the roadside. Every line may park different kinds of cars. There are many streets in some residential areas  , and there is a kind of rule that any car cannot park at any time or any period time. In every parking, there are some special positions for invalid   people. 4. About the priority of passenger and car: At any case, passengers have the priority to cars. And only after passengers have passed the road and got the top of sidestep, cars may go ahead. In general, traffic rules of America are very specific, convenient, safe and humanizing.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In Britain, conscription resulted in the calling up of nearly every physically fit man in Britain—six of ten million eligible. Of these, about 750,000 lost their lives. Most deaths were to young unmarried men; however, 160,000 wives lost husbands and 300,000 children lost fathers. Conscription during the First World War began when the British government passed the Military Service Act in 1916. The act specified that single men aged 18 to 40 years old were liable to be called up for military service unless they were widowed with children or ministers of a religion. There was a system of Military Service Tribunals to adjudicate upon claims for exemption upon the grounds of performing civilian work of national importance, domestic hardship, health, and conscientious objection. The law went through several changes before the war ended. Married men were exempt in the original Act, although this was changed in June 1916.

Q: Passage: In an attempt at reform, Eritrean government officials and NGO representatives have participated in numerous public meetings and dialogues. In these sessions they have answered questions as fundamental as, \\"What are human rights?\\", \\"Who determines what are human rights?\\", and \\"What should take precedence, human or communal rights?\\" In 2007, the Eritrean government also banned female genital mutilation. In Regional Assemblies and religious circles, Eritreans themselves speak out continuously against the use of female circumcision. They cite health concerns and individual freedom as being of primary concern when they say this. Furthermore, they implore rural peoples to cast away this ancient cultural practice. Additionally, a new movement called Citizens for Democratic Rights in Eritrea aimed at bringing about dialogue between the government and opposition was formed in early 2009. The group consists of ordinary citizens and some people close to the government. Question: What did the Eritrean government ban in 2007?

Article: Pseudomonas usually produce mild symptoms in healthy people with strong immune systems. These infections may be water-borne. There have been reports of:  Eye infections in people who use extended-wear contact lenses. To avoid this, change your contact lens solution instead of topping it up. Do not wear your contacts for longer than recommended by your doctor or the manufacturer's instructions. Ear infections in children after swimming in contaminated water. This can occur if the pool does not have enough chlorine to adequately disinfect it. Skin rashes after using a contaminated hot tub. This rash generally manifests as itchy red bumps or blistered filled with fluid around the hair follicles. It may be worse in areas where your skin was covered by a bathing suit. Signs and symptoms of pseudomonas depend on where the infection occurs.  Blood infections are characterized by fever, chills, fatigue, muscle and joint pains, and are extremely serious.  Lung infections (pneumonia) include symptoms like chills, fever, a productive cough, difficulty breathing.  Skin infections may cause an itchy rash, bleeding ulcers, and/or headache.  Ear infections may present with swelling, ear pain, itching inside the ear, discharge from the ear, and difficulty hearing.  Eye infections caused by pseudomonas may include the following symptoms: inflammation, pus, swelling, redness, pain in the eye, and impaired vision. The doctor will likely want to look at the rash and may take a sample of the bacteria to send to the lab to confirm the diagnosis. This may be done in two ways:  Swabbing the infection on your skin Taking a biopsy. Doing a biopsy is rare. If you are otherwise healthy, treatment may not be necessary. Your immune system may clear the infection itself. However, your doctor may suggest:  Anti-itch medications if you have an itchy rash Antibiotics if you have a serious infection. The doctor may be more likely to prescribe antibiotics if you have an infection in your eye. What is a summary?","output":"Pseudomonas infections usually produce mild symptoms in healthy individuals but can cause more severe infections in those with weaker immune systems. Common sources of infection include contaminated water, extended-wear contact lenses, and contaminated pools or hot tubs. Symptoms vary depending on the affected area, with eye, ear, skin, blood, and lung infections presenting differently. Diagnosis usually involves examining the rash or taking a swab for lab analysis, with biopsies being rare. While treatment may not always be necessary, anti-itch medications and antibiotics may be prescribed when needed, especially in cases of eye infections or those with weakened immune systems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The nine-man group, which included Arnett, Browne, AP photographer Horst Faas, David Halberstam, Neil Sheehan of United Press International, and CBS's Peter Kalischer and photographer Joseph Masraf waited outside the building with their equipment. After an hour-long religious ceremony, the Buddhist monks, numbering around 300, filed out of the pagoda into a narrow alley along a side street, where they were blocked and ordered to stop by plain-clothed policemen. The Buddhists did not resist, but Arnett and Browne began taking photos of the confrontation. The police, who were loyal to Ngo Dinh Nhu, thereupon punched Arnett in the nose, knocked him to the ground, kicked him with their pointed-toe shoes, and broke his camera. Halberstam, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the Buddhist crisis, was a tall man, standing around 20 centimetres (8 in) taller than the average Vietnamese policeman.

Process:  - One type of air pollution is the addition of carbon dioxide gas into the air - Some scientists believe that releasing too much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is one of the causes of global warming - This upsets the balance of the carbon cycle - The ozone layer helps protect us from harmful rays from the sun - It is getting damaged from air pollution such as methane gas from livestock and CFCs from spray cans - Acid rain is created when gasses such as sulfur dioxide get high into the atmosphere - The wind can blow these gasses for miles and then they get washed out of the air when it rains - This rain is called acid rain and can damage forests and kill fish.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more conservation occurs happens, how will it affect more global warming occurs.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation, which is more conservation, does have a direct and indirect effect on the process of global warming and air pollution. Step-by-step explanation: 1. More conservation implies a reduction in human activities contributing to air pollution, such as the release of carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, and CFCs. 2. Reducing the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere will help maintain the balance of the carbon cycle, which could alleviate the effects of global warming. 3. Decreasing methane emissions, particularly from livestock and agriculture, will help lessen the damage to the ozone layer, better protecting us from harmful rays from the sun. 4. Reducing CFC emissions from various sources like spray cans will also minimize the damage to the ozone layer, aiding in the restoration of this crucial protective layer. 5. Lowering sulfur dioxide emissions will decrease the formation of acid rain. The wind will continue to have the potential to blow gasses, but with fewer pollution particles present, the resultant rain will be less acidic. 6. Lessening the occurrences of acid rain will, in turn, protect forests and aquatic life, promoting healthier ecosystems. In conclusion, more conservation practices have both direct and indirect impacts on the process of global warming and air pollution. By minimizing the release of harmful gasses and pollutants, we can mitigate some of the negative effects on our environment, including forest damage, ozone layer depletion, and the decline of aquatic life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Robert Griffin III’s skills offer risks and rewards Griffin practiced during the week after receiving medical clearance to do so, and the team’s coaches said that, barring a recurrence of his concussion symptoms, they expected him to play against the Vikings. The team also spent the week readying rookie backup Kirk Cousins and third-stringer Rex Grossman in case Griffin suffered a setback. But if Griffin indeed starts Sunday, the game will be the first test of how differently Griffin might play and how differently the Redskins might use him. “He’s a smart guy,” Redskins linebacker London Fletcher said. “He understands. He knows his value to this football team and how important it is to have him out there playing.” Former NFL coach Dan Reeves said the burden of safeguarding Griffin falls in large part to the young quarterback himself. “I think he’ll learn as he goes along,” Reeves said in a telephone interview. “He’ll learn how to protect himself. There’s a time to be a competitor. And there’s a time not to take people on. Sometimes you have to watch yourself.” Reeves, who was Michael Vick’s first NFL coach with the Falcons, said a team also must do its part and learn as it goes along when it has a quarterback, like Vick or Griffin, who is a dynamic runner along with being a threat as a passer. “He’s so talented,” Reeves said. “As a coach, you want to use all those things. But you also have to protect him. It’s a learning process. He’s going to get enough chances to run with the ball just off the passing plays that you call, when things break down, even without having a lot of designed runs for him. It’s difficult as a coach when you have a player with so many talents. You want to use them all. But you have to have an attitude where you step back and say, ‘We have to ease up here to keep him healthy.’ It’s a learning process for both.” Reeves said the Redskins have done a good job of crafting an offensive system to get the most out of Griffin’s talents. The Redskins blended elements of tactics associated with the college version of the sport, such as the spread offense and the triple-option running game, with more conventional NFL strategies to assemble an offensive system for Griffin that has befuddled opposing defenses at times. The Redskins are ranked seventh in the league in total offense, based on yards gained, and eighth in scoring. Griffin has thrown the ball efficiently and has run the ball well when needed, with four rushing touchdowns to go with his four touchdown passes in five games. Griffin’s running was being curtailed even before he got hurt. He had a total of 33 rushing attempts in the Redskins’ first three games, including 13 in a loss at home Sept. 23 to the Cincinnati Bengals. The Redskins seemed to dial back the college-like offensive looks during a Sept. 30 triumph at Tampa in which Griffin had eight rushing attempts.

Summarize this article: Very small scratches that need to be touched up quickly can actually be repaired using only a walnut or pecan. Begin by breaking the meat of the nut open so that the nut's oils are exposed. Gently rub the nut back and forth along the scratch in the wood surface. The oils in the nut will naturally fill in and darken the scratched area, lending the exposed raw wood a finished look. This technique works well for quickly minimizing the appearance of small surface imperfections. Summary:","output":"To repair small scratches on wood surfaces, use the oils from a walnut or pecan.
