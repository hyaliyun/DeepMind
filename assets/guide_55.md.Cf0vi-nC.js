Therefore, in 100 kg of alloy B, there will be ( frac{1}{5} times 100 = 20 ) kg of tin and ( frac{4}{5} times 100 = 80 ) kg of copper. Now, when we mix the two alloys, the total amount of tin in the new alloy is given as 44 kg. This total amount of tin comes from the tin in both alloy A and alloy B.

Prove that there are infinitely many such selected quadrilaterals, no two of which share a vertex.","output":"To prove that there are infinitely many selected grid rectangles such that no two of them have a common vertex, we proceed with the following steps. 1. **Initial Coloring**:    We start by coloring the grid points of a plane using k colors. Given the problem statement, it's ensured that there exists at least one grid rectangle whose vertices are all the same color. Let this rectangle be denoted as A. 2. **Re-coloring Around Rectangle A**:    Now, create a new coloring scheme by changing the colors of the vertices of rectangle A to four new colors, which we can denote as k+1, k+2, k+3, k+4. 3. **Existence of Another Rectangle**:    According to the conditions of the problem, there will still be at least one grid rectangle whose vertices are all the same color under this new coloring scheme. Denote this rectangle as B. The key observation here is that none of the vertices of rectangle B can coincide with those of rectangle A, because B needs all its vertices to be the same color, and the new colors k+1, k+2, k+3, k+4 are unique and could not repeat, ensuring B's vertices are not among A's vertices. 4. **Re-coloring Around Rectangle B**:    Recolor the vertices of rectangle B with another set of four new colors, denoted as k+5, k+6, k+7, k+8.  5. **Repetition of Process**:    Repeat the procedure. After each recoloring, there will still exist at least one grid rectangle, say rectangle C, whose vertices are all the same color. Since each subsequent re-coloring introduces new unique colors that do not overlap with any of the colors used in previous rectangles, rectangle C will also have no vertices in common with rectangles A or B. 6. **Inductive Step for Infinite Rectangles**:    Assume that we have selected n pairwise disjoint grid rectangles. By using the same recoloring argument, we can always find a new rectangle that shares no vertices with those already chosen. Hence, we can repeat this process indefinitely. **Conclusion**: This argument shows that we can select infinitely many grid rectangles such that no two rectangles have any vertex in common. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Given the function fleft(xright)=4x^{2}4ax+a^{2}2a+2.

The vertex of this parabola is at (1, -2), indicating the axis of symmetry is x = 1. Since the coefficient of x^2 is positive, the parabola opens upwards, meaning it decreases on the interval [-1, 1) and increases on (1, 3). - The minimum value occurs at the vertex, x = 1:  f_{min} = f(1) = 4(1 - 1)^2 - 2 = -2. - To find the maximum value within the interval [-1, 3), we evaluate f(x) at the endpoints -1 and 3 (noting that 3 is not included in the interval, so we only consider -1): f_{max} = f(-1) = 4(-1 - 1)^2 - 2 = 4(2)^2 - 2 = 16 - 2 = 14.

This implies that (A) and (B) must be disjoint sets, i.e., (A cap B = emptyset). 3. **Cardinality Relations**:    Since (A) and (B) are disjoint and each pair ((j, k) in M) contributes one element to each of the sets (A) and (B), we have:    [    |A| + |B| leq n    ]    Furthermore, since every element (j) from set (A) pairs with a unique element (k) from set (B):    [    |M| leq min(|A|, |B|)    ] 4. **Bounding ( |M| )**:    To find the upper bound of (|M|), we can consider the constraints due to the disjoint nature of (A) and (B):    [    |A| leq frac{n}{2} quad text{and} quad |B| leq frac{n}{2}    ]    Hence, the maximal cardinality of (M) can be deduced as:    [    |M| leq frac{n(n-1)}{4}    ]    Here, we have assumed pairs ((j, k)) are chosen optimally. 5. **Achieving the Bound**:    To achieve this maximal cardinality, consider constructing (M) as follows:    [    M = {(a, b) mid a = 1, 2, ldots, leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor text{ and } b = leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor + 1, ldots, n}    ]    Thus, the pairs ((j, k)) form a set such that no element in set (B) appears as the first element in any other pair, satisfying the given property.    By construction, it can be observed that:    [    |M| = leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor times left( n - leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor right)    ]    For even (n):    [    |M| = frac{n}{2} times frac{n}{2} = frac{n^2}{4}    ]    For odd (n):    [    |M| = leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor times left( n - leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor right) = leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor left( leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor + 1 right)    ] # Conclusion: The maximal cardinality of the set ( M ) is: [ boxed{leftlfloor frac{n^2}{4} rightrfloor } ]"},{"instruction":"space, there are two skew lines and a point A on one of them.

Let (P) and (Q) be the midpoints of the arc (BC) not containing (A) and containing (A), respectively.

Similarly, (overline{CO}) is the perpendicular bisector of (overline{QX}). Thus, (O) is the circumcenter of (triangle QXY). 5. **Congruency and Cyclic Quadrilateral**: The congruency (triangle BQY cong triangle CQX) implies:    [    angle QYA = angle QYB = angle QXC = 180^circ - angle QXA    ]    Hence, (AXQY) lie on a circle (omega) with circumcenter (O). 6. **Incenter and Excenter**: The final claim is that (X) and (Y) are the incenter and (P)-excenter of (triangle APQ). We verify this for (X); the verification for (Y) is similar.    - **Incenter Verification**: Observe that (C in overline{AX}) is the midpoint of the arc (PQ) not containing (A), so (overline{AX}) bisects (angle QAP). Now, note that:      [      angle QXA = 180^circ - angle QXC = 180^circ - left(90^circ - frac{1}{2} angle QCXright) = 90^circ + frac{1}{2} angle QPA      ]      This means the incenter of (triangle APQ) must lie on (omega). Since it must also lie on the line (AX), we conclude that (X) is the incenter of (triangle APQ). 7. **Conclusion**: Since (X) and (Y) are the incenter and (P)-excenter of (triangle APQ), the line (XY) passes through the midpoint of the arc (BC) (not containing (A)) of the circumcircle of (triangle ABC).

Therefore, f(x) = boxed{frac{17}{5}} when tan x = frac{1}{2}.

Then, we express it as a phase shift of a sine function: f(x) = sqrt{2}sinleft(2x + frac{pi}{4}right) + 2. Since the argument of the sine function is 2x, the smallest positive period T corresponds to 2x having a period of 2pi: T = frac{2pi}{2} = pi. So the smallest positive period of f(x) is boxed{pi}. For decreasing intervals, we find when the sqrt{2}sinleft(2x + frac{pi}{4}right) part is decreasing, which happens between frac{3pi}{2} + 2kpi and frac{5pi}{2} + 2kpi for integer k.

This represents a circle centered at C_1(0,0) with radius r_1=sqrt{5}.        - For circle C_2, the equation is x^2+y^2-4x-8y-m=0. Completing the squares, we rewrite this as (x-2)^2+(y-4)^2=20+m. This represents a circle centered at C_2(2,4) with radius r_2=sqrt{20+m}, where m>-20 to ensure the radius is real. 2. **Apply the condition for external tangency:**    The circles are externally tangent, which means the distance between their centers, |C_1C_2|, is equal to the sum of their radii, r_1+r_2. Therefore, we have:    [    |C_1C_2| = r_1 + r_2    ]    Substituting the values, we get:    [    sqrt{(2-0)^2 + (4-0)^2} = sqrt{5} + sqrt{20+m}    ]    Simplifying, we find:    [    sqrt{4 + 16} = sqrt{5} + sqrt{20+m}    ]    [    sqrt{20} = sqrt{5} + sqrt{20+m}    ] 3. **Solve for m:**    Squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots, we get:    [    20 = 5 + 20 + m + 2sqrt{5}sqrt{20+m}    ]    Simplifying, we see that the term 2sqrt{5}sqrt{20+m} is unnecessary since we made a mistake in squaring the sum (correcting this step, we should directly solve for m from the step before squaring). Correctly, from sqrt{20} = sqrt{5} + sqrt{20+m}, we should subtract sqrt{5} and sqrt{20} from both sides to isolate sqrt{20+m}, leading to:    [    sqrt{20+m} = sqrt{20} - sqrt{5}    ]    Squaring both sides correctly, we find:    [    20 + m = 20 - 2sqrt{20}sqrt{5} + 5    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    m = -2sqrt{20}sqrt{5} + 5    ]    Realizing the mistake in the algebraic manipulation, we correct our approach to directly solve for m from the equality sqrt{20} = sqrt{5} + sqrt{20+m} without unnecessary squaring. The correct step is to recognize that the equation was already properly set for solving m without further algebraic manipulation. Thus, directly solving from sqrt{2^2 + 4^2} = sqrt{5} + sqrt{20+m}, we find:    [    m = -15    ] Therefore, the correct value of m is boxed{-15}."},{"instruction":"A factory produces three different models of products: A, B, and C.

This sequence of weighing results can be represented by a word made up of the letters ( L ) and ( R ): ( L R L R L R ldots ).

Let the masses of the weights be denoted as ( m_1 < m_2 < ldots < m_n ). 2. We will place the weights sequentially as follows:    - Place ( m_1 ) on the left pan (resulting in ( L )).    - Place ( m_2 ) on the right pan (resulting in ( R )).    - Place ( m_3 ) on the left pan (resulting in ( L )).    - Place ( m_4 ) on the right pan (resulting in ( R )), and so on. 3. The sequence of weighing results will be ( L R L R L R ldots ). 4.

Thus, continuing this pattern ensures that the initially heavier side alternates, giving the sequence ( L R L R L R ldots ).  Part b) 1. We need to show that for any word of length ( n ) composed of letters ( L ) and ( R ), we can place the weights on the pans of the scales such that this word represents the sequence of weighing results. **Construction**: 1. Place all weights with even indices on one pan and all with odd indices on the other. 2. The heaviest weight ( m_n ) should be placed on the left or right pan according to the last letter of the given word:     - If the last letter is ( L ), place ( m_n ) on the left.    - If the last letter is ( R ), place ( m_n ) on the right. 3. Proceed backward from the last letter to the first letter of the word:    - If the letter dictates a change (from ( L ) to ( R ) or vice versa), remove the heaviest remaining weight from the corresponding pan.    - If no change is necessary, remove the lightest remaining weight. 4. Each step leaves a segment of consecutively indexed weights that alternately end up on one or the other pan as required. By this method, each time, a segment of weights is left on the pans, iterating this method ensures that the given word ( L R ldots ) is achieved in the sequence of results.

Each sheep moves 1 meter away from the wolf if the wolf is within 2 meters of its line. If the wolf is far from all lines, the topmost sheep will move. 4. Since movements of both the wolf and the sheep are restricted to 1 meter per move in any direction, let's analyze the relative movement:     - If the wolf attempts to approach a particular horizontal line (or sheep), his projection on that line will lag behind the position of the sheep on that line. This means the sheep can always move 1 meter away from the wolf whenever the latter tries to get closer. 5. Given the wolf is initially below 4 meters from the topmost sheep (4 meters below the highest line initially), any sheep that feels threatened will move away horizontally by 1 meter per move whenever the wolf tries to approach within a 2 meters range. 6.

If two individuals know each other, we draw a red edge between the corresponding vertices; if they do not know each other, we draw a blue edge between the corresponding vertices. The problem then is to find the smallest integer n such that any 2-colored complete graph K_n either contains a blue triangle or a red K_4. 2. **Working with Graph K_8:**    Firstly, consider the edge coloring problem with K_8:    - As shown in Figure 7-7 of the original problem, there exists a 2-colored K_8 that does not contain a blue triangle and also does not contain a red K_4. 3. **Increasing the Number of Vertices:**    Given the properties of K_8 in this problem, we increase n to 9 and check the required conditions.     4. **Analysis for K_9:**    Consider any graph K_9 and analyze it:    - **Step (1):** Suppose there is a vertex ( A_1 ) which is connected to at least 4 vertices ( A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5 ) by blue edges. Since there are no blue triangles in ( K_9 ), the ( K_4 ) subgraph formed by vertices ( A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5 ) must have all its edges colored red. Thus, we have found a red K_4.    - **Step (2):** Suppose there is a vertex ( A_1 ) which is connected by at most 2 blue edges. Thus, it is connected by at least ( 9 - 1 - 2 = 6 ) red edges. Then, ( A_1 ) is connected to vertices ( A_2, A_3, ldots, A_7 ) by red edges. Since ( K_6 ) contains either a blue or red triangle (by the Erdős–Szekeres theorem), and there is no blue triangle, there must be a red triangle. Suppose ( triangle A_2 A_3 A_4 ) is red, then along with ( A_1 ), ( {A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4} ) forms a red K_4.    - **Step (3):** If each vertex is connected by exactly 3 blue edges and thus 5 red ones, every point in the graph results in ( frac{1}{2} times 9 times 3 = 13.5 ) total blue edges, which isn't an integer. Thus, this configuration is impossible. 5. **Conclusion:**    This proves that in a 2-colored ( K_9 ), either there is a blue triangle or a red K_4.

Since ( 2^q - 1 mid 2^n - 1 ) by properties of exponents (where ( 2^n - 1 = (2^q - 1)(1 + 2^q + cdots + 2^{q(r-1)}) )), there is a prime ( q ge 3 ) such that: [ m^2 equiv -9 pmod{2^q - 1} ] 2. **Consider a prime ( p ) that divides ( 2^q - 1 ):** We need to check if (-9) is invertible modulo ( p ), which is equivalent to checking if ( 3^2 equiv 9 ) is invertible modulo ( p ). 3. **Determine a contradiction using properties of quadratic residues:** Since ( 2^q - 1 equiv -1 pmod{4} ) when ( q ) is odd, ( p equiv -1 pmod{4} ). Hence, (-9) (or equivalently, (3)) being invertible modulo ( p ) leads to: [ m^2 equiv -3^2 pmod{p} ] Using Fermat's Little Theorem, we know: [ m^{p-1} equiv 1 pmod{p}, ] [ 3^{p-1} equiv 1 pmod{p} ] but: [ (m^2)^{frac{p-1}{2}} equiv 1 equiv (-1)^{frac{p-1}{2}} 3^{p-1} equiv -1 pmod{p} ] which is a contradiction since the order of 1 (mod ( p )) should be 1. Hence, if ( n ) is a solution, ( n ) has to be a power of 2. 4. **Checking if the converse is true:**    - Let ( n = 2^k ) and test for ( 2^{2^k} - 1 ). [ F_k = 2^{2^k} - 1 ] Using the factorization of ( F_k ): [ F_k = (2+1)(2^2+1) cdots (2^{2^{k-1}}+1) ] [ 3 mid F_k implies 3 mid m^2 implies m^2 = 9m'^2 ] Because ( m = 3m' ), ( m'^2 + 1 ) divides ( F_k ). Using the properties of the moduli, we verify ( m' in mathbb{N^*} ). 5. **Using Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT):**    - The moduli ( 2^l + 1 ) are pairwise coprime when ( n = 2^k ), and the system ( E ) can be solved ensuring ( m^2 + 9 ) divisible by ( 2^n - 1 ). Thus, the conclusion is: [ {n | n = 2^k, k in mathbb{N} } ]  (boxed{n text{ being a power of 2}})"},{"instruction":"A box contains 3 red marbles, 3 green marbles, and 3 yellow marbles.

So, sin 137^{circ}cos 13^{circ}-cos 43^{circ}sin 13^{circ} = sin(137^{circ} - 13^{circ}) = sin 124^{circ}. Now, we need to simplify sin 124^{circ}. Since 124^{circ} = 180^{circ} - 56^{circ}, we can use the complementary angle identity for sine: sin(180^{circ} - theta) = sin theta. So, sin 124^{circ} = sin 56^{circ}.

This looks like a difference of sines formula, but with the angles swapped. So, let's use the difference formula for sines again, but this time we'll swap the angles: sin(B - A) = sin B cos A - cos B sin A.

This leads us to two inequalities: - x - 1 leqslant 3, which simplifies to x leqslant 4, - -(x - 1) leqslant 3, or x - 1 geqslant -3, which simplifies to x geqslant -2. Combining these, we get -2 leqslant x leqslant 4, so A = [-2, 4]. 2. **Finding B:** The inequality frac{x-1}{x+3} ＜ 0 implies that the numerator and denominator have opposite signs. Considering the critical points x = 1 (numerator is zero) and x = -3 (denominator is zero), we split the real line into three intervals: x < -3, -3 < x < 1, and x > 1. - For x < -3, both numerator and denominator are negative, so the fraction is positive. - For -3 < x < 1, the numerator is negative, and the denominator is positive, so the fraction is negative. - For x > 1, both numerator and denominator are positive, so the fraction is positive. Hence, the solution set where the fraction is negative, and thus less than 0, is -3 < x < 1, so B = (-3, 1). Therefore, A cap B = [-2,1), and the complement of B, complement_{R}B, consists of all x such that x leqslant -3 or x geqslant 1. **Part (Ⅱ):** 1. **Analysis of A cup C = A:** Given A cup C = A, it implies that C subseteq A.

Given that C = {x | 2-m leqslant x leqslant 2+m}, we need to find conditions on m such that C is entirely contained within A = [-2, 4]. 2. **Finding the range of m:** - When C = varnothing, this occurs if 2-m > 2+m, which simplifies to m < 0. - When C neq varnothing, we must have 2-m geqslant -2 and 2+m leqslant 4. Solving these gives us m geqslant 0 and m leqslant 2, respectively.

She loaned out 15 to her friend. When her friend returned the money with a certain interest, Lizzy had 33. What was the interest rate?","output":"To find the interest rate, we first need to determine the amount of interest Lizzy received when her friend returned the money. Lizzy had 30 initially and loaned out 15. When her friend returned the money, Lizzy had 33. The amount of interest Lizzy received is the difference between the amount she had after her friend returned the money and the amount she had before loaning out the money. Interest received = Final amount - Initial amount (after loaning out) Interest received = 33 - (30 - 15) Interest received = 33 - 15 Interest received = 18 Now, we know that the interest received was 18, but this includes the original 15 that was loaned out. So, the actual interest earned is: Actual interest earned = Interest received - Original loan amount Actual interest earned = 18 - 15 Actual interest earned = 3 The interest rate is the actual interest earned divided by the original loan amount, then multiplied by 100 to get a percentage.

To determine (lambda), evaluate (mathrm{g}(x)) at (x = 0): [ mathrm{g}(0) = 0 cdot mathrm{f}(0) - 2 = -2. ] Substituting ( x = 0 ) in the expression for (mathrm{g}(x)), we get: [ mathrm{g}(0) = lambda (0-1)(0-2) cdots (0-2013) = lambda (-1)(-2) cdots (-2013) = lambda (-1)^{2013} (2013!). ] Thus,  [ -2 = lambda (-2013!). ] Solving for (lambda), [ lambda = frac{2}{2013!}. ] 5.

Similarly, for C={x mid x^2 + 2x - 8 = 0}, the roots are x = 2 and x = -4, so C = {2, -4}. Given that A cap B = A cup B, we can infer that A = B = {2, 3}. This implies that the equation x^2 - ax + a^2 - 19 = 0 must have roots x = 2 and x = 3. By solving the system of equations derived from setting these values as roots: begin{align*} (2)^2 - 2a + a^2 - 19 &= 0,  (3)^2 - 3a + a^2 - 19 &= 0, end{align*} we find that a = 5. Therefore, we have boxed{a = 5} for the first condition.

Since one root of the equation x^2 - ax + a^2 - 19 = 0 is x = 3, plugging x = 3 into the equation yields two possible values for a: begin{align*} (3)^2 - 3a + a^2 - 19 &= 0,  9 - 3a + a^2 - 19 &= 0,  a^2 - 3a - 10 &= 0,  (a - 5)(a + 2) &= 0. end{align*} Thus, a = -2 or a = 5. If a = -2, then A = {-5, 3}, which matches the conditions since 3 is in B and -5 is not in C.

So, the l.c.m = h.c.f × 14 × 15 l.c.m = 23 × 14 × 15 Now, let's calculate the l.c.m: l.c.m = 23 × 14 × 15 l.c.m = 322 × 15 l.c.m = 4830 The l.c.m of the two numbers is 4830. Now, let's denote the two numbers as A and B. Since 23 is the h.c.f, both A and B are multiples of 23. Also, since 14 and 15 are the other factors of the l.c.m, one of the numbers must be a multiple of 14 and the other must be a multiple of 15.

Solving for a_1, we get a_1 = frac{2}{3}. For n geq 2, we have a_{n-1} = 2 - 2S_{n-1}. Thus, a_n - a_{n-1} = 2 - 2S_n - (2 - 2S_{n-1}) = -2a_n. Rewriting, we have 3a_n = a_{n-1}. Therefore, the sequence {a_n} is a geometric sequence with the first term frac{2}{3} and common ratio frac{1}{3}. The general term can be expressed as a_n = frac{2}{3} cdot (frac{1}{3})^{n-1} = 2 cdot (frac{1}{3})^n for n in mathbb{N^*}.

The guests are acquainted in pairs as follows:    - Guest 1 is acquainted with Guest 2 but not with Guest 3.    - Guest 3 is acquainted with Guest 2 but not with Guest 1. Now, let's establish another set of relationships: - Each son is familiar with a different pair of guests. Visualizing the process: 1. Draw the chord for the host. Since the host knows everyone, his chord should ideally intersect all other chords. Therefore, this creates three intersection points where the host’s chord encounters the chord for each guest. 2. Guest's chords details:    - Guest chords intersect the host's chord at three distinct points, including one middle point and two extremities.    - Name these chords based on their positions as middle and extreme chords.    - Sons' chords concern: A son, familiar only with extreme guests, should intersect the respective extreme chords without intersecting the middle chord.

A son's chord intersecting the extreme chords will also need to intersect the middle chord according to Chichikov's rule. However, by design, the son's chord bypasses the middle chord.

To prove f(x) geqslant x - x^2, we consider the function h(x) = ln(x+1) - x + x^2 for x geqslant 0. We calculate the derivative of h(x) as follows: [h'(x) = frac{d}{dx}[ln(x+1) - x + x^2] = frac{1}{x+1} - 1 + 2x.] Simplifying the derivative, we get: [h'(x) = frac{1}{x+1} + 2x - 1 = frac{2x^2 + x}{x+1} geqslant 0.] Since h'(x) geqslant 0 for all x geqslant 0, h(x) is monotonically increasing on [0, +infty). Evaluating h(x) at x=0, we find: [h(0) = ln(1) - 0 + 0^2 = 0.] Therefore, since h(x) is monotonically increasing and h(0) = 0, we have h(x) geqslant 0 for all x geqslant 0. This proves that ln(x+1) geqslant x - x^2. 2. For the inequality f(x) + x geqslant g(x) to hold, we rewrite it as ln(x+1) geqslant frac{ax}{1+x}. Let m(x) = ln(x+1) - frac{ax}{1+x}. We want to ensure m(x) geqslant 0 for all x geqslant 0. Calculating the derivative of m(x), we get: [m'(x) = frac{1}{x+1} - frac{a(1+x) - ax}{(1+x)^2} = frac{x+1-a}{(1+x)^2}.] For m'(x) > 0, we need x+1-a > 0, which simplifies to x > a-1. If a leqslant 1, then m(x) is monotonically increasing on [0, +infty), and since m(0) = 0, m(x) geqslant 0 always holds. If a > 1, then m(x) is monotonically decreasing on [0, a-1] and increasing on (a-1, +infty). In this case, m(x)_{min} = m(a-1) < m(0) = 0, so m(x) geqslant 0 does not always hold.

The train is currently moving at 4/5 of its usual speed, so its current speed is (4/5)S. The relationship between speed, time, and distance is given by the formula: Distance = Speed × Time Since the distance the train travels doesn't change, we can set up the equation for the usual journey and the slower journey as follows: Usual Distance = Usual Speed × Usual Time Slower Distance = Slower Speed × Slower Time Since the distances are the same, we have: Usual Speed × Usual Time = Slower Speed × Slower Time S × T = (4/5)S × Slower Time We can solve for Slower Time by dividing both sides by (4/5)S: Slower Time = (S × T) / ((4/5)S) Slower Time = T / (4/5) Slower Time = T × (5/4) Slower Time = 3 hours × (5/4) Slower Time = 3.75 hours The train is therefore taking 3.75 hours instead of 3 hours to complete the journey when it's moving at 4/5 of its usual speed. To find out how many minutes the train is late, we need to calculate the difference between the slower time and the usual time: Late Time = Slower Time - Usual Time Late Time = 3.75 hours - 3 hours Late Time = 0.75 hours To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): Late Time in minutes = 0.75 hours × 60 minutes/hour Late Time in minutes = 45 minutes The train is boxed{45}  minutes late."},{"instruction":"The music festival of Bassompierre begins tonight with a concert by the string orchestra PIANISSIMO.

The circumference of a full circle with this radius would be 2pi times 1.5 = 3pi units, but since we only have semi-circles, each arc has a length of 1.5pi units. There are 8 such arcs in total, so the total length contributed by the arcs is 8 times 1.5pi = 12pi units. There are also 8 straight segments each of length 3 units, contributing a total length of 8 times 3 = 24 units. Thus, the total length of the boundary is 12pi + 24 units. Calculating 12pi approx 37.7 and adding 24 gives us 61.7. Thus, rounded to the nearest tenth, the length is boxed{61.7} units."},{"instruction":"** In triangle ABC, we have AB = AC = 26 and BC = 24.

When the two trains meet, they have traveled for the same amount of time. Let's call this time ( x ) hours. At this point, train A would have traveled ( 60x ) kilometers, and train B would have traveled ( 90x ) kilometers. After meeting, train A takes 9 more hours to reach its destination, so the total distance it travels is ( 60x + 60 cdot 9 ). Train B takes ( t ) more hours to reach its destination, so the total distance it travels is ( 90x + 90t ). Since both trains reach their destinations, the distances they travel must be the same. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: [ 60x + 60 cdot 9 = 90x + 90t ] Now, let's solve for ( t ): [ 60x + 540 = 90x + 90t ] [ 540 = 30x + 90t ] [ 18 = x + 3t ] We know that ( x = frac{9}{2} ) because train A takes 9 hours after meeting train B to reach its destination.

Since there are 8 players, the last term would be: 1 + (8-1)*2 = 1 + 7*2 = 1 + 14 = 15 (the eighth player took 15 cookies) Now we can find the sum: Sum = 8/2 * (1 + 15) = 4 * 16 = 64 So, the basketball team members took a total of 64 cookies. Andy ate 3 cookies himself, so we add those to the total taken: 64 (team) + 3 (Andy) = 67 cookies Now, we know Andy started with 72 cookies, so we subtract the total taken from the starting amount to find out how many cookies Andy gave to his little brother: 72 (starting amount) - 67 (taken) = 5 cookies Andy gave his little brother boxed{5}  cookies."},{"instruction":"A paper triangle with sides of lengths 6, 8, and 10 inches, as shown, is folded so that point C falls on the midpoint of line segment AB.

Given that the speed of the car is twice the speed of the bicycle, the speed of the car is 2x kilometers per hour.

Since they arrived at the same time, the time taken by the bicycle to travel 10 km and the time taken by the car (including the 20 minutes delay) to travel the same distance should be equal. The time taken to travel a certain distance is given by the distance divided by the speed. Therefore, for the bicycle, the time taken is frac{10}{x} hours, and for the car, it is frac{10}{2x} hours. However, since the car started 20 minutes (which is frac{20}{60} = frac{1}{3} hour) later, we add this delay to the car's travel time to equate it with the bicycle's travel time. Setting up the equation based on the above understanding, we have: [ frac{10}{x} = frac{10}{2x} + frac{1}{3} ] Multiplying every term by 3x to clear the denominators, we get: [ 3 cdot 10 = frac{3x cdot 10}{2x} + 3x cdot frac{1}{3} ] Simplifying, we find: [ 30 = 15 + x ] Solving for x, we obtain: [ x = 30 - 15 = 15 ] Thus, the speed of the bicycle is 15 kilometers per hour. To find the speed of the car, we recall that it is twice the speed of the bicycle, which gives us: [ 2x = 2 times 15 = 30 ] Therefore, the speed of the bicycle is boxed{15} kilometers per hour, and the speed of the car is boxed{30} kilometers per hour."},{"instruction":"Which of the following statements is incorrect?

In fact, the closer |r| is to 1, the stronger the linear correlation between the two variables. Therefore, **Statement A is incorrect**. - **Statement B:**   - It is stated that if a random variable X follows a normal distribution N(30,100), then its expectation E(X)=10.   - However, for a normal distribution N(mu,sigma^{2}), the expectation E(X) is equal to mu.

Since x_1 and x_2 are two zero points of the function g(x)=ln x+frac{1}{2x}-m, we have ln x_1+frac{1}{2x_1}-m=0 and ln x_2+frac{1}{2x_2}-m=0. Subtracting the two equations gives ln frac{x_1}{x_2}=frac{1}{2x_2}-frac{1}{2x_1}, which can be rewritten as ln frac{x_1}{x_2}=frac{x_1-x_2}{2x_2x_1}. Therefore, x_1x_2=frac{x_1-x_2}{2ln frac{x_1}{x_2}}. Thus, x_1=frac{frac{x_1}{x_2}-1}{2ln frac{x_1}{x_2}} and x_2=frac{1-frac{x_2}{x_1}}{2ln frac{x_1}{x_2}}. Let t=frac{x_1}{x_2}, where 0 < t < 1. Then, x_1+x_2=frac{t-1}{2ln t}+frac{1-frac{1}{t}}{2ln t}=frac{t-frac{1}{t}}{2ln t}. Consider the function h(t)=t-frac{1}{t}-2ln t (0 < t < 1). The derivative of h(t) is h'(t)=frac{(t-1)^2}{t^2}. Since 0 < t < 1, we have h'(t) > 0. Therefore, h(t) < h(1), which implies t-frac{1}{t}-2ln t < 0. Consequently, frac{t-frac{1}{t}}{2ln t} > 1, and hence boxed{x_1+x_2 > 1}."},{"instruction":"triangle triangle ABC, the sides opposite to the internal angles A, B, and C are a, b, and c respectively.

Hence, B is whimsical.    - Conclusion from \\"Yes\\": The sibling A indicates that B is not necessarily trustworthy. Thus, sibling A could be whimsical. To ensure accuracy, we next ask C. 5. **Second Question:**    - Suppose from the first sibling (A), we got the answer implying B's nature, we now direct our second question to C.    - Ask C whether the direction they point to is the correct path home. 6. **Final Decision Based on Second Question:**    - If C’s response aligns with the logical consistency (provided through the ruling out done through the first question), we affirm the chosen path.    - If there’s a discrepancy noticed through the truthful-deceptive matrix built (i.e., logical consistency not maintained), the vagrant adjudges based on correctly identifying the whimsical sibling. # Conclusion: By systematically analyzing the implications of the answers, the vagrant effectively isolates reliable information from the siblings, thus: [ boxed{text{Ask the second sibling identified as trustworthy and choose accordingly}} ]"},{"instruction":"Given the sets A={x|x^22x3<0} and B={x|x>1}, then Acap B equals to ( ) A: {x|x>1} B: {x|x<3} C: {x|1<x<3} D: {x|1<x<1}","output":"Since set A={x|x^2-2x-3<0}={x|3>x>-1}, Therefore, Acap B={x|1<x<3}, Hence, the correct choice is boxed{text{C}}."},{"instruction":"Given a sequence {a_n} with the sum of the first n terms denoted as S_n, for any n in N_{+}, S_n=(1)^{n}a_n+ frac{1}{2^{n}}+n3 and (ta_{n+1})(ta_n) < 0 always holds, then the range of the real number t is ______.","output":"From S_n=(-1)^{n}a_n+ frac{1}{2^{n}}+n-3, we get a_1=-frac{3}{4};   When n geqslant 2, a_n=S_n-S_{n-1}=(-1)^{n}a_n+ frac{1}{2^{n}}+n-3-(-1)^{n-1}a_{n-1}- frac{1}{2^{n-1}}-(n-1)+3   =(-1)^{n}a_n+(-1)^{n}a_{n-1}- frac{1}{2^{n}}+1,   If n is even, then a_{n-1}= frac{1}{2^{n}}-1, therefore a_n= frac{1}{2^{n+1}}-1 (for odd n);   If n is odd, then a_{n-1}=-2a_n- frac{1}{2^{n}}+1=2(frac{1}{2^{n+1}}-1)- frac{1}{2^{n}}+1=3- frac{1}{2^{n-1}},   therefore a_n=3- frac{1}{2^{n}} (for even n).

The probability of a normally distributed random variable falling within one standard deviation of the mean (i.e., between mu - sigma and mu + sigma) is approximately 0.68. This means that the probability of X being less than the mean (mu = 2) is 0.5 since a normal distribution is symmetric about its mean. Given P(0 < X < 4) = 0.4, we can divide this probability into two equal parts because of the symmetry of the normal distribution about its mean (mu = 2). Thus, we have: P(0 < X < 2) = P(2 < X < 4) = frac{0.4}{2} = 0.2 The probability that X is less than 2 (which includes the probability that X is between 0 and 2 and the probability that X is less than 0) is 0.5 because 2 is the mean of the distribution, and by the property of normal distribution, half of the values lie below the mean. Thus: P(X < 2) = 0.5 To find P(X < 0), we subtract the probability that X is between 0 and 2 from the probability that X is less than 2: P(X < 0) = P(X < 2) - P(0 < X < 2) = 0.5 - 0.2 = 0.3 Therefore, the correct answer is: boxed{C: 0.3}"},{"instruction":"Given two vectors mathbf{v} and mathbf{w} such that |mathbf{v}| = 3 and |mathbf{w}| = 5, and the angle between them is frac{pi}{3}, find mathbf{v} cdot mathbf{w}.","output":"The dot product of two vectors is given by the formula: [ mathbf{v} cdot mathbf{w} = |mathbf{v}| |mathbf{w}| cos theta ] where theta is the angle between the vectors.

For simplicity, let’s start with (M) being on height from vertex (A) to the side (BC).  4. **Using Trigonometry with Symmetry:**     - For point (M) being on one of the heights, let’s denote the heights from vertices (A), (B), and (C) to the opposite sides are (h_A), (h_B), and (h_C) respectively. 5. **Checking the condition away from the heights:**     - Let us consider any point (M) that is not on the heights. By drawing the line segment (BM), it will intersect the other two heights (from vertices (A) and (C)) at points (M_1) and (M_2) respectively.     - For the condition (angle MAB + angle MBC + angle MCA = frac{pi}{2}) to hold, we would have:         - (angle MA M_{1} = angle MCA = x)         - (angle M A M_{2} = angle M C M_{2} = y)         - So, ( x + y + angle B M A + angle B C M = frac{pi}{2} ) 6. **Verification by symmetry:**     - Through symmetry and properties of a circumscribed circle in a triangle, any equidistant points along the heights will be symmetric and should inherently satisfy the angle condition owing to the equilateral properties.     - Any deviations mean that the angles will exceed (frac{pi}{2}) when summed up, as (M_1) and (M_2) are the basis ensuring equality. 7. **Angle criterion leading contradiction:**     - Trying to satisfy the angle condition elsewhere while moving (M) shows a continued contradiction unless it's on the heights. # Conclusion: Hence the geometric locus of points (M) such that (angle MAB + angle MBC + angle MCA = frac{pi}{2}) must lie on the heights of the equilateral triangle (ABC).

Mathematically:      [      a_i + b_i = 1 + 2 = 3 quad text{(this holds true for any such differing pair)}      ]          This implies every place where ( A ) has 1 and ( B ) has 2 (and vice versa) results in a (3) in the sum. 4. **Ensure Two Digits Equal to Three**: To prove the sum ( A + B ) contains at least two (3)s:        Because ( A ) and ( B ) differ at exactly half of their positions (given they have an equal even or odd number of (1)s), the sum ( A + B ) will have multiple places where 1 and 2 sum to 3. Importantly, at least two of those positions will indeed contribute a (3).     5. **Conclusion**: By constructing the groups based on the parity (even or odd number) of (1)s in the ten-digit numbers and verifying the conditions above, we have ensured that any two numbers from the same group, when summed, will contain at least two digits that are 3. Thus, it is proven that the set of all ten-digit numbers composed exclusively of the digits 1 and 2 can be divided into two groups such that the sum of any two numbers from the same group contains at least two digits equal to 3.

A: 1 B: 0 C: i D: 1","output":"**Analysis**: The primary focus of this problem is to test the understanding of the geometric meaning of complex numbers and the rules of complex number operations. It is a basic problem. We need to simplify the complex number z and then use the concept of complex numbers to find the result. **Step-by-Step Solution**: Given that z(i+1)=frac{2}{i-1}, we first simplify the right side of the equation. Multiply both the numerator and the denominator of frac{2}{i-1} by the conjugate of the denominator (i+1):  frac{2}{i-1} = frac{2(i+1)}{(i-1)(i+1)} = frac{2i+2}{i^2-1} = frac{2i+2}{-1} = -2-2i  So, we have:  z(i+1) = -2-2i  Now, divide both sides by (i+1) to solve for z:  z = frac{-2-2i}{i+1}  To simplify z, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator (i-1):  z = frac{(-2-2i)(i-1)}{(i+1)(i-1)} = frac{-2i+2-2i^2-2i}{i^2-1} = frac{-2i+2-2(-1)-2i}{-1} = frac{4-4i}{-1} = -4+4i  Now, we observe the imaginary part of z. The imaginary part of -4+4i is 4i, but the answer choices are in real numbers. Therefore, we need to check if our simplification is correct. Looking back at z(i+1)=-2-2i, we can try to write z in the form a+bi, where a and b are real numbers. We can rewrite the equation as:  z(i+1) = (a+bi)(i+1) = ai+a+bi^2+bi = ai+a-b+bi = -b+(a-b)i  Equating real and imaginary parts with the original equation, we have:  begin{cases} -b = -2  a-b = -2  end{cases}  Solving this system of equations, we find a=-1 and b=0.

This is a crucial observation because it sets the stage for proving the upper limits based on the total number of candies available. 4. **Total candies**:      - Initially, there are (3 times 10 = 30) candies in total.     - Given the process described, the object is to show that the maximum Carlson can eat is less than or equal to 27.   5. **Proof by contradiction**: To show that Carlson cannot eat 30 candies, assume that he could:     - Before the last operation, there would be exactly 3 candies left.     - Each of the numbers on the boxes (4, 7, 10) is greater than 3.

Therefore, the total sum of the three two-digit numbers can be expressed as:    [    10 times (text{sum of tens digits}) + (text{sum of units digits})    ] 7. **Calculate the range of possible total sums:**    The smallest possible total sum is:    [    10 times 6 + 6 = 66    ]    The largest possible total sum is:    [    10 times 15 + 15 = 165    ] 8. **Determine the number of unique total sums:**    The total sums range from 66 to 165. To find the number of unique sums, we note that each sum is an integer and the sums increase by 1 for each unique combination of tens and units sums. Therefore, the number of unique total sums is:    [    165 - 66 + 1 = 100    ] The final answer is (boxed{100})."},{"instruction":"Buffy has a sailboat with a planing hull that she sails in the Gulf of Mexico.

Part (a) - Cube: 1. **Start with One Edge:**    To understand the threading of a cube through a slit, consider slicing the plane in the shape resembling the letter \\"H\\". Begin by bringing one edge of the cube close to the crossbar of the \\"H\\" shape.    2. **Align Another Edge Parallel:**    Move the cube such that one of its edges aligns parallel to the crossbar, and gradually pass it through the slit. 3. **Account for the Other Edges:**    The next stage involves moving the cube so that another pair of \\"vertical\\" edges of the cube comes to the incision. This is to ensure that the cube can finally be passed without any edge being obstructed by the slit.    4. **Final Adjustment:**    Continue the process, ensuring all edges are aligned correctly, allowing the cube to pass through the slit formed in the plane without breaking it into separate parts. This method ensures that you can successfully thread a cube frame through a thin slit.  Part (b) - Tetrahedron: 1. **Initial Position and Orientation:**    For threading a tetrahedron through a slit, consider a slit in the shape of the letter \\"T\\". Place the tetrahedron so that one of its faces lies parallel to the plane, and the opposite vertex is pointing towards the plane. 2. **Prepare for Movement Through the Slit:**    Hold the tetrahedron in such a way that one vertex is at the start of the slit. Begin to thread it by moving two edges along the horizontal part of the \\"T\\", while one edge moves along the vertical part.    3. **Pivoting Around the Edge:**    When an edge that is parallel to the plane reaches the slit, pivot the tetrahedron around this edge. This maneuver ensures that the tetrahedron continues to pass through the slit without breaking it into separate parts.    4. **Final Passage:**    Push the remaining part of the tetrahedron through the slit. This step should be straightforward once the three edges of the tetrahedron are correctly threaded through their respective parts of the \\"T\\" slit. By carefully maneuvering and orienting the tetrahedron, it can also be passed through the slit without breaking the plane. # Conclusion: - **(a) Cube:** It is possible to thread the framework of a cube through a plane slit without breaking the plane into parts. - **(b) Tetrahedron:** It is possible to thread the framework of a tetrahedron through a plane slit without breaking the plane into parts.

Therefore, we find    [    1 leq frac{a}{12} < 10    ]    which simplifies to     [    12 leq a < 120    ] 4. **Divide (a) by 12 and check decimal representation:**        We need to check the integers (a) in steps:    [    12 leq a < 120    ]    Let's list a few ( frac{a}{12} ) calculations to check if the decimal form meets our criteria:    - (frac{18}{12} = 1.5)    - (frac{30}{12} = 2.5)    - (frac{42}{12} = 3.5)    - (frac{54}{12} = 4.5)    - (frac{66}{12} = 5.5)    - (frac{78}{12} = 6.5)    - (frac{90}{12} = 7.5)    - (frac{102}{12} = 8.5)    - (frac{114}{12} = 9.5) 5. **Arrange the results in ascending order:**    The fractions that meet the criteria arranged from smallest to largest are:    [    1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5, 9.5    ] 6. **Identify the penultimate (second to last) number:**    From the ordered list, the penultimate number is (8.5), which corresponds to the fraction (frac{102}{12}). # Conclusion: The desired number in fractional form is: [ frac{102}{12} = 8.5 ] Therefore, my number is: [ boxed{8.5} ]"},{"instruction":"Pegs are placed in a board such that they are 1 unit apart horizontally and 2 units apart vertically.

To determine the maximum number of cells a circle with radius 10 can intersect, we will follow these detailed steps: 1. **Understanding the Circle's Dimensions:**    - The radius of the circle is (10), so the diameter is:      [      2 times 10 = 20      ]      Therefore, the circle spans 20 units horizontally and vertically from its center. 2. **Bounding Box Calculation:**    - Consider that the circle is centered at the origin ((0,0)). The bounding box of the circle, a square with the side equal to the diameter, has the corners at ((-10, -10)), ((10, -10)), ((-10, 10)), and ((10, 10)).    - This bounding box contains:      [      21 times 21 = 441 text{ cells}      ]      because each side of the bounding box spans from -10 to 10 inclusive (21 units each way). 3. **Examining Maximum Intersection Scenario:**    - The key observation is that the maximum number of cells a circle can intersect on a grid can be thought of in terms of the circle's proximity to intersecting edges of these cells.    - Knowing that a circle can touch or intersect cells at most twice (considering both horizontal and vertical edges), we examine its structure in relation to the grid. 4. **Cell Interaction Calculation:**    - To maximize the count, consider cells around the circumference of the circle. Each time a circle intersects an edge of a grid cell, it can do so at up to two distinct edges. 5. **Applying Geometric Considerations:**    - A rough upper limit for the cells could be approximated by considering the length of the circumference of the circle.    - The circumference is given by:      [      2 pi times 10 approx 62.83      ]      Thus, the circle might intersect several cells multiple times. However, using practical trials, particularly examining smaller circles and scaling up, leads us to higher values, informed by geometric packing theories and practical combinatorial solutions. 6. **Applying Analytical Estimates:**    - Analytical estimates and maximum theoretical problem analysis (from combinatorial geometry solutions) bring us close to roughly half the bounding cells participating. 7. **Conclusion:**    - By examining similar known maximization problems and computing trials, it is derived that the maximal number of grid cells the described circle can intersect is actually:      [      boxed{80}      ] This experience aligns with studied extremal combinatorial geometry problems and empirical tests confirmed in bounded circular problems on unit grids.

For a permutation ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) of ( 1, 2, ldots, n ), we want to maximize the sum of these distances. 2. **Maximizing Individual Terms:**    To maximize ( |a_i - i| ), we should aim to make ( a_i ) as different from ( i ) as possible. The maximum value of ( |a_i - i| ) occurs when ( a_i ) is either ( 1 ) or ( n ) (the furthest values from ( i )). 3. **Constructing the Permutation:**    Consider the permutation that alternates between the largest and smallest remaining values. For example, for ( n = 4 ), the permutation ( 4, 1, 3, 2 ) maximizes the sum:    [    |4 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |3 - 3| + |2 - 4| = 3 + 1 + 0 + 2 = 6    ] 4. **Generalizing the Pattern:**    For a general ( n ), the permutation that alternates between the largest and smallest remaining values will maximize the sum.

The sum of the (x)-coordinates of these points is an odd integer. We need to prove that the sum of the (y)-coordinates of these points is at least 1. 2. **Geometric Interpretation:**    The points ((x_j, y_j)) lie on a half-circle in the upper half-plane. Without loss of generality, we can assume the half-circle is centered at the origin with radius (r). Thus, the equation of the half-circle is:    [    x_j^2 + y_j^2 = r^2 quad text{and} quad y_j ge 0    ] 3. **Sum of (x)-coordinates:**    Given that (sum_{j=1}^{2n} x_j) is an odd integer, we need to consider the properties of the (x)-coordinates. Since the points are on the half-circle, the (x)-coordinates range from (-r) to (r). 4. **Symmetry and Parity:**    If the points were symmetrically distributed about the (y)-axis, the sum of the (x)-coordinates would be zero (an even integer). However, since the sum is given to be an odd integer, the points cannot be symmetrically distributed. This implies an imbalance in the distribution of the points along the (x)-axis. 5. **Implication on (y)-coordinates:**    To achieve an odd sum of (x)-coordinates, there must be an asymmetry in the distribution of the points. This asymmetry implies that there are more points on one side of the (y)-axis than the other. Consequently, the (y)-coordinates of these points must contribute to maintaining the balance of the half-circle. 6. **Summing (y)-coordinates:**    Since the points are on the upper half-circle, all (y_j ge 0). The imbalance in the (x)-coordinates suggests that the (y)-coordinates must sum to a value that compensates for the asymmetry. Given that the sum of the (x)-coordinates is an odd integer, the sum of the (y)-coordinates must be sufficiently large to ensure the points lie on the half-circle. 7. **Conclusion:**    The asymmetry in the (x)-coordinates (resulting in an odd sum) implies that the sum of the (y)-coordinates cannot be zero. Therefore, the sum of the (y)-coordinates must be at least 1 to maintain the geometric constraints of the half-circle.

Therefore, the frequency of the scores within the given range is 3 (since there are three scores within the interval). Now, the relative frequency, which can be used to estimate the population probability, is calculated as follows: Relative frequency = Frequency of scores within range / Total number of scores                    = 3 / 10                    = 0.3 Thus, the estimated probability that the mathematics test scores of students in this grade fall between 79.5 and 85.5 is boxed{0.3}."},{"instruction":"Given that the geometric sequence {a_n} is increasing and a_1 > 0, if 2(a_{n+2}  a_n) = 3a_{n+1}, then the common ratio q of the sequence {a_n} is (　　) A: 2 or frac{1}{2} B: 2 C: frac{1}{2} D: 2","output":"According to the problem, let's assume the common ratio of the geometric sequence {a_n} is q.

Speed of jogger = 9 km/hr = 9 * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hr / 3600 s) = 2.5 m/s Speed of train = 45 km/hr = 45 * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hr / 3600 s) = 12.5 m/s The relative speed of the train with respect to the jogger is the difference between their speeds because they are moving in the same direction. Relative speed = Speed of train - Speed of jogger Relative speed = 12.5 m/s - 2.5 m/s = 10 m/s The train passes the jogger in 41 seconds, so the distance covered by the train relative to the jogger in that time is the relative speed multiplied by the time.

The number of ways to do this is the permutation of 5 items taken 2 at a time, which is calculated as: [A_{5}^{2} = frac{5!}{(5-2)!} = frac{5 times 4 times 3!}{3!} = 5 times 4 = 20] So, there are 20 ways to arrange the volunteers at the ends. **Step 2: Arrange the remaining people.**   Considering the 2 elderly people as a single unit together with the remaining 3 volunteers, we now have 4 units to arrange. The number of ways to arrange these 4 units is the permutation of 4 items taken all at once, which is: [A_{4}^{4} = frac{4!}{(4-4)!} = frac{4!}{0!} = 4! = 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 24] Thus, there are 24 ways to arrange these units. **Step 3: Arrange the 2 elderly people among themselves.**   The 2 elderly people, treated as a single unit in the previous step, can be arranged among themselves in: [A_{2}^{2} = frac{2!}{(2-2)!} = frac{2!}{0!} = 2! = 2 times 1 = 2] So, there are 2 ways to arrange the elderly people. **Final Calculation:**   To find the total number of different ways to arrange them, we multiply the results of the three steps together: [20 times 24 times 2 = 480 times 2 = 960] Therefore, the total number of different ways to arrange them is boxed{960} ways, which corresponds to choice B."},{"instruction":"Two cyclists started simultaneously towards each other from two locations that are 270 km apart.

The total number of possible elements in a sequence of ratios is p+1 (the symbol infty and p numbers from the p-arithmetic).    - If all these elements are included in R_1, then r = p+1, thus proving the claim.    - Otherwise, take a number a not included in R_1 and consider the Fibonacci sequence (1, a, ldots).

Part (b): - Consider the Fibonacci sequence modulo p:   [   c_0 = 0, quad c_1 = 1, quad c_2 = 1, ldots   ]   - Construct the sequence of ratios:     [     overline{t_1} = frac{c_1}{c_0} = infty, ldots, bar{t}_n = frac{c_n}{c_{n-1}}     ]   - If sqrt{5} is not extractable, the period length is a divisor of p+1. Thus,     [     bar{t}_{p+2} = bar{t}_{1+(p+1)} = bar{t}_1 = infty     ]     indicating c_{p+1} = 0, hence a_{p+1} is divisible by p.   - If sqrt{5} is extractable, similarly c_{p-1} = 0, hence a_{p-1} is divisible by p. **Conclusion:** boxed{}"},{"instruction":"Given the set U={1,2,…,n} (ninmathbb{N}^*, ngeqslant 2), for two nonempty subsets A, B of set U, if Acap B=varnothing, then the pair (A,B) is called a mutually exclusive subset pair of set U.

Since the store offers a 2 discount for every 10 purchase, we can calculate the total discount by dividing the total amount paid by 10 and then multiplying by 2. Total amount paid = 128 To find the number of 10 purchases, we divide the total amount paid by 10: Number of 10 purchases = 128 / 10 = 12.8 Since the discount is only applied to whole 10 purchases, we consider only the whole number part of 12.8, which is 12.

We add the total discount to the total amount paid: Actual amount spent on peaches = Total amount paid + Total discount Actual amount spent on peaches = 128 + 24 = 152 Now that we have the actual amount spent on the peaches, we can calculate the number of peaches Kataleya bought. Each peach costs forty cents (0.40), so we divide the actual amount spent on peaches by the cost per peach: Number of peaches = Actual amount spent on peaches / Cost per peach Number of peaches = 152 / 0.40 To find the number of peaches, we divide 152 by 0.4: Number of peaches = 152 / 0.4 = 380 Kataleya bought boxed{380}  peaches."},{"instruction":"A watch was sold at a certain loss percentage.

We start by defining the set of n consecutive integers as a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n. 2. We need to show that out of these n consecutive integers, we can find two distinct numbers whose product is divisible by mn where m < n. 3. First, we note that for any integer k, the set of n consecutive integers can be written as:    [    {k, k+1, k+2, ldots, k+n-1}    ] 4. We will use the Pigeonhole Principle to show that there must be at least one integer in the set which is divisible by m, and at least one integer divisible by n. 5. Consider the integers modulo m. The set {k, k+1, k+2, ldots, k+n-1} covers exactly n consecutive integers. Since m < n, by the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least one multiple of m within these integers. 6. Similarly, consider the integers modulo n. The set {k, k+1, k+2, ldots, k+n-1} must also contain at least one multiple of n because n is one of the elements in the set. 7. Let a_i in {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n} such that a_i is divisible by m. Let a_j in {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n} such that a_j is divisible by n. 8. It is guaranteed that i neq j since m < n, thus avoiding both indices being the same. 9. Next, because a_i is divisible by m and a_j is divisible by n, their product a_i cdot a_j is divisible by m cdot n:    [    a_i cdot a_j equiv 0 pmod{mn}    ] 10. Now we need to consider the greatest common divisor (GCD), denote d = gcd(m, n) and the least common multiple (LCM), denote q = mathrm{lcm}(m, n). Hence, we have:     [     mn = d cdot q     ] 11. Suppose i = 1 without loss of generality (assumption for simplicity). Now, we need to ensure at least one of the following numbers is within the set:     [     a_i + d quad text{or} quad a_i - d     ] 12.

In this case, ( z ) can be represented as ( z = a_0 ) where ( a_0 in {0, 1} ). Since ( z ) is a non-zero complex number with integer real and imaginary parts, the only possible value for ( z ) is ( 1 ). Thus, ( z = 1 ) is good. 2. **Inductive Step:**    Assume that any complex number ( z ) with ( |z| = x_i ) can be represented as ( a_0 + a_1(1+i) + a_2(1+i)^2 + dots + a_n(1+i)^n ) where ( a_j in {0, 1} ) and ( a_n = 1 ) for all ( n leq k ).

We can write ( z ) as:    [    z = (1+i)z' + delta    ]    where ( z' in mathbb{Z}[i] ) and ( delta in {0, 1} ). 4. **Norm Calculation:**    The norm of ( z ) is given by:    [    |z|^2 = |(1+i)z' + delta|^2    ]    Since ( |1+i| = sqrt{2} ), we have:    [    |z|^2 = 2|z'|^2 + 2text{Re}(z'overline{delta}) + |delta|^2    ]    If ( delta = 0 ), then:    [    |z|^2 = 2|z'|^2    ]    If ( delta = 1 ), then:    [    |z|^2 = 2|z'|^2 + 2text{Re}(z') + 1    ] 5. **Case Analysis:**    - If ( delta = 0 ), then ( |z| = sqrt{2}|z'| ). Since ( |z| = x_{k+1} ) and ( |z'| < |z| ), by the induction hypothesis, ( z' ) can be represented as ( a_0 + a_1(1+i) + dots + a_n(1+i)^n ). Thus, ( z = (1+i)z' ) is good.    - If ( delta = 1 ), then ( |z| = sqrt{2}|z' + frac{1}{sqrt{2}}| ). We need to check if ( |z' + frac{1}{sqrt{2}}| < |z| ). If this holds, then by the induction hypothesis, ( z' ) can be represented as ( a_0 + a_1(1+i) + dots + a_n(1+i)^n ). Thus, ( z = (1+i)z' + 1 ) is good. 6. **Uniqueness:**    To prove uniqueness, assume that ( z ) has two different representations:    [    z = a_0 + a_1(1+i) + dots + a_n(1+i)^n = b_0 + b_1(1+i) + dots + b_m(1+i)^m    ]    where ( a_j, b_j in {0, 1} ) and ( a_n = b_m = 1 ).

Ignoring the thickness of the cylinder and the balls, a plane is tangent to both balls. If the figure obtained where this plane intersects the edge of the cylinder is an ellipse, find the area of this ellipse.","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem**: We are given a cylindrical canister with a height ( h = 10 ) and a base radius ( r = 1 ). Two spheres are inserted into this cylinder, one touching the lower base and the walls, and the other touching the upper base and the walls. We need to find the area of the ellipse formed when a plane intersects the two spheres and the cylinder circumferentially. 2. **Cylinder Section**: To find the dimensions of this ellipse, we start by examining a vertical cross-section of the cylinder. The vertical cross-section through the center forms a rectangle with height ( h = 10 ) and width ( 2r = 2 ). 3. **Intersecting Spheres**:    a. Since each sphere touches both the cylinder base and walls, the diameter of each sphere is ( 2r = 2 ). Thus, the radius of each sphere is ( r = 1 ).    b. These spheres’ centers are at ( x = 0 ), ( y = pm(5 - r) = pm4 ) (since one is at the bottom base plus the radius and the other at the top base minus the radius). 4. **Ellipse Long Axis Calculation**:    a. Consider the vertical plane passing through the centers of the spheres. This plane intersects the cylinder creating an ellipse with:    b. Length of major axis (2a) is twice the vertical separation between the centers of two spheres which is ( 2 times 4 = 8). 5. **Ellipse Short Axis Calculation**:    a. The short axis of the ellipse will be the same as the diameter of the cylinder's base because the horizontal plane intersects both spheres and the cylinder's circular base.    b. Hence, the minor axis (2b) is (2 times r = 2 times 1 = 2). 6. **Ellipse Area Calculation**:    a. The area of an ellipse is given by the formula ( pi times a times b ).    b. Here, the semi-major axis ( a = 4 ) and the semi-minor axis ( b = 1 ).    c.

It is rolled repeatedly until the sum of the numbers rolled exceeds 12.

This is because rolling any of the faces 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 will cause the sum to exceed 12. 3. **Analyzing Each Case**:        If S = 12:    - The next roll could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.    - Therefore, the total sum becomes 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,  or 18.    If S = 11:    - The next roll could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,  or 6.    - Therefore, the total sum becomes 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,  or 17.    If S = 10:    - The next roll could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,  or 6.    - Therefore, the total sum becomes 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,  or 16.    If S = 9:    - The next roll could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,  or 6.    - Therefore, the total sum becomes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,  or 15.    If S = 8:    - The next roll could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,  or 6.    - Therefore, the total sum becomes 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,  or 14.    If S = 7:    - The next roll could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,  or 6.    - Therefore, the total sum becomes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,  or 13. 4. **Identifying the Overlapping Values**:    - From the above analysis, we see that the sums 13 appears as a possible outcome in each scenario S = 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, and 7. 5. **Conclusion**:    - Since 13 appears in all possible pre-roll sums, it is the most likely sum after the dice rolls cause the total to exceed 12.

Define the number of valid coloring schemes that satisfy the given conditions as ( f_k(n) ). 2.

When ( 1 leq n leq k-1 ), each point’s color can be chosen independently, so ( g_k(n) = 2^n ). 4. For ( n = k ), the only invalid scheme is one where all points are blue, so ( g_k(k) = 2^k - 1 ). 5. For ( n geq 1 ), denote the number of valid coloring schemes where the last point is red as ( g_k^{(1)}(n) ), and where the last point is blue as ( g_k^{(0)}(n) ). Since adding a red point to a valid coloring scheme of ( n ) points results in another valid scheme:    [    g_k^{(1)}(n+1) = g_k(n)    ] 6. For ( g_k^{(0)}(n+1) ), we must ensure that the last ( k-1 ) points are not all blue.

Note that they share two elements a and b.    - For S_j sim S_k, S_k must share exactly two elements with S_j. Suppose S_k = {a, b, e}.     - Since S_i shares two elements a and b with S_k, it follows that S_i sim S_k.        Since the relation sim is transitive, all subsets in mathcal{S} can be partitioned into equivalence classes where each class contains subsets that all share exactly two elements. 3. **Equivalence Classes and Cases**:    - Each equivalence class can correspond to a distinct group of elements. Let's analyze possible cases based on the number of elements:      1. **Case 1**: The equivalence class covers exactly 3 elements.          - Here, there is only one subset possible ({a, b, c}) in the equivalence class.      2. **Case 2**: The equivalence class covers exactly 4 elements.          - There are binom{4}{3} = 4 subsets possible, each sharing 2 elements with other members of the class.      3. **Case 3**: The equivalence class covers more than 4 elements.          - Let's choose two subsets S_i = {a, b, c} and S_j = {a, b, d}. Since they share a and b, there must be an element e such that another subset S_k = {a, b, e} exists in this class.          - Continue considering that for larger sets, there are more combinations, but every subset in the class must share exactly two elements with at least another subset. 4. **Contradiction Proof**:    - If we have at least n=5 elements, and n+1 subsets, any attempt to force they all fall into the previous cases ends up requiring more subsets than there are three-element combinations possible based on these strict rules.     - Calculate the possible maximum combinations:      - With 5 elements in X, binom{5}{3} = 10 subsets are possible.      - Summing for equivalence classes larger than 4 must capture more than n elements.        Therefore, the assumption that no two subsets share exactly one element leads to a contradiction because it makes reaching n+1 non-redundant subsets impossible considering the strict intersection properties.

Now, we consider the coefficient of x, which is (2m-3), to determine the direction of the inequality:    - When 2m-3 > 0, we divide both sides by 2m-3 to isolate x, keeping the direction of the inequality the same:      x < frac{n-3}{2m-3}    - When 2m-3 < 0, dividing by a negative number flips the inequality:      x > frac{n-3}{2m-3} 5. Special cases:    - When 2m-3=0, i.e., m=frac{3}{2}, the inequality simplifies to 3 < n. If n > 3, the solution set is all real numbers because the inequality 3 < n does not involve x.    - However, if m=frac{3}{2} and n leqslant 3, the original inequality cannot be satisfied, and there is no solution.

For the coefficient of x^{10} in x^2(x+2)^{10}, we look at the term T_{r+1} with r = 2, which corresponds to x^8 (because x^2 cdot x^8 = x^{10}).

This is equivalent to -0.1n leqslant X - 0.5n leqslant 0.1n, or |X - 0.5n| leqslant 0.1n. - Applying Chebyshev's inequality, Pleft(|X - 0.5n| leqslant 0.1nright) geqslant 1 - frac{0.25n}{(0.1n)^2}. - Setting this probability to be at least 98% (0.98), we solve:   [   1 - frac{0.25n}{(0.1n)^2} geqslant 0.98 implies n geqslant 1250   ] - Thus, to have at least 98% confidence that the frequency of transmitting the signal \\"1\\" is between 0.4 and 0.6, the minimum number of signal transmissions n should be boxed{1250}."},{"instruction":"Frank is 15 years younger than John.

What is the smallest number of turns required to find the heaviest coin? <details><summary>Thanks</summary>Thanks to the user Vlados021 for translating the problem.</details>","output":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the smallest number of turns required to find the heaviest coin among ( n ) coins using ( n ) balances, where one balance is faulty.  1. **Construction:**    - Pick any two coins and compare them using two different balances.    - If both balances show the same result (i.e., both indicate the same coin is heavier), then we can be confident about the result. We discard the lighter coin.    - If the balances show different results, we compare the two coins using a third balance. Since only one balance is faulty, the third balance will give us the correct result.    - We then discard the lighter coin based on the result from the third balance.    - This process ensures that we can determine the heavier coin in each comparison with certainty.    Since we need to compare ( n-1 ) pairs of coins to find the heaviest coin, and each comparison might require up to 2 turns (one for the initial comparison and one for the verification), the total number of turns required is ( 2(n-1) + 1 ). The additional 1 turn accounts for the final comparison when only two coins remain. 2. **Lower Bound:**    - We need to show that at least ( 2n-1 ) turns are necessary.    - Consider a directed graph ( G ) where vertices represent coins and a directed edge ( u to v ) indicates that coin ( u ) is heavier than coin ( v ) based on a balance comparison.    - Each edge in the graph is colored based on which balance was used for the comparison.    - To determine the heaviest coin, we need to ensure that each coin (except the heaviest) has an indegree of at least 2. This is because we need at least two reliable comparisons to confirm the relative weight of each coin.    - If a coin ( u ) has an indegree of 1 or less, it means we have insufficient information to determine its weight relative to other coins, especially if the balance used for the comparison is faulty.    - Therefore, to ensure that each coin (except the heaviest) has an indegree of at least 2, we need at least ( 2n-2 ) edges in the graph.    - Since each comparison can add at most one edge to the graph, and we need to account for the possibility of a faulty balance, we need at least ( 2n-1 ) turns to ensure we have enough reliable comparisons to determine the heaviest coin. Thus, the smallest number of turns required to find the heaviest coin is ( 2n-1 ). The final answer is ( boxed{2n-1} )"},{"instruction":"The ratio of boys to girls in a kindergarten is 2:3.

What is the probability that the product of their rolls is a multiple of 4?","output":"To determine the probability that the product of the two die rolls is a multiple of 4, we must consider various scenarios: 1. At least one of the numbers rolled must be multiple of 4. 2. If not, one number must be a double even number (which makes a product involving another even number a multiple of 4). From the 10-sided die: - The multiples of 4 are 4 and 8. Thus, Maria has a frac{2}{10} = frac{1}{5} chance of rolling a multiple of 4. - The even but not multiple-of-4 numbers are 2, 6, 10. That's 3 possible rolls out of 10, giving another fraction frac{3}{10}. From the 6-sided die: - The multiples of 4 are 4. Thus, Karim has a frac{1}{6} chance of rolling a multiple of 4. - The even but not multiple-of-4 numbers are 2 and 6. That's 2 out of 6, resulting in a frac{2}{6} = frac{1}{3} probability. Next, we combine probabilities: - Either Maria rolls a multiple of 4 (frac{1}{5}), or Karim rolls a multiple of 4 but Maria does not roll a multiple of 4 (probability that Karim rolls a 4 and Maria rolls a non-multiple of 4 is frac{1}{6} times frac{4}{5} = frac{4}{30} = frac{2}{15}). - Maria rolls an even number (not multiple of 4) and Karim must also roll an even number (frac{3}{10} times frac{1}{3} = frac{1}{10}). The different overlapping cases require us to calculate cumulative probability: - Probability that either Maria or Karim rolls a multiple of 4: frac{1}{5} + frac{2}{15} - frac{2}{30} = frac{6}{30} + frac{4}{30} - frac{2}{30} = frac{8}{30} = frac{4}{15} (since product of rolls being each a multiple of 4 was double counted). - Additional probability that both roll even, thereby getting a multiple of 4 through their product of two evens: frac{1}{10}. Adding these probabilities gives frac{4}{15} + frac{1}{10} = frac{8}{30} + frac{3}{30} = frac{11}{30}.

Real yield = [(1 + 0.097) / (1 + 0.02)] - 1 Real yield = [1.097 / 1.02] - 1 Real yield = 1.07549 - 1 Real yield = 0.07549 To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: Real yield = 0.07549 * 100 Real yield = 7.549% Therefore, the adjusted yield of the stock, taking into account tax and inflation implications, is approximately boxed{7.55%} ."},{"instruction":"A stack of triangles.

Walking one complete lap around the fountain means that Xiao Ming's walking route is closed and the fountain is inside this route.)","output":"1. Let's define the problem more clearly: Xiao Ming starts at point ( A ) and needs to walk along the small paths around a fountain in a square. The goal is to make a complete loop back to point ( A ) without repeating any segments. 2. Notice that at each point around the fountain, there are two possible paths to take, except at point ( A ) when returning, where restrictions apply to avoid repeating paths. 3. There are 8 pairs of path segments, denoted as ( (a_1, a_2), (b_1, b_2), ..., (h_1, h_2) ). For each pair, Xiao Ming can choose to take either one of the two paths. 4. If we consider only the clockwise direction initially:     - Each pair of segments offers 2 choices (( a_1 ) or ( a_2 ), ( b_1 ) or ( b_2 ), ..., ( h_1 ) or ( h_2 )).     - Therefore, there are ( 2^8 ) total combinations of choices for the fully closed loop.    Hence,    [    2^8 = 256 text{ paths}    ] 5. Among these paths, we must exclude the paths where selecting segments simultaneously from ( a_2 ) and ( h_2 ), because those would intersect and repeat paths.    Considering the simultaneous selection where the paths of ( a_2 ) and ( h_2 ) overlap or repeat:    - We exclude these by computing the valid paths if we only choose ( a_2 ) and ( h_2 ) paths both together. This decreases the choices by 2 pairs.    - Thus, valid paths in this restriction result in:    [    2^6 = 64 text{ invalid paths}    ] 6. The valid clockwise paths avoiding the overlap would then be:    [    2^8 - 2^6 = 256 - 64 = 192 text{ valid paths clockwise}    ] 7.

Here are the steps for verifying this systematically: 1. **Understanding the Problem Statement**:    - We need a four-digit number, i.e., a number between 1000 and 9999.    - The sum of its digits should be 14.    - The number should be divisible by 14. 2. **Creating the Number**:    Let's denote the four-digit number as ( abcd ), where ( a, b, c, d ) are its digits.    - The sum of the digits: ( a + b + c + d = 14 ). 3. **Conditions for Divisibility by 14**:    A number is divisible by 14 if it is divisible by both 2 and 7:    - **Divisibility by 2**: The last digit ( d ) must be even.    - **Divisibility by 7**: This requires checking the number modulo 7. 4. **Example Verification**:    We are given that ( 6314 ) is a possible number. Let's verify it:    - First, check the sum of the digits:       [      6 + 3 + 1 + 4 = 14       ]      This satisfies the sum condition.    - Now, check if it is divisible by 14:      - Divisibility by 2: The last digit ( 4 ) is even, so ( 6314 ) is divisible by 2.      - Divisibility by 7: We will use the divisibility rule for 7. 5. **Divisibility by 7** (Direct calculation method):    Calculate ( 6314 div 7 ):    [    6314 div 7 = 902    ]    Since ( 902 ) is an integer, ( 6314 ) is divisible by 7. 6. **Combining Both Conditions**:    Since ( 6314 ) is divisible by both 2 and 7, it is divisible by ( 2 times 7 = 14 ).

This point is equidistant from the vertices of the triangle, not necessarily from its sides. - **Option B: The Angle Bisectors of the Three Angles of the Triangle**   - The property of angle bisectors states that a point located on the angle bisector is equidistant from the two sides of the angle.

We need to determine the largest number of positive integers that can be among these numbers. 2. **Initial Observations:**    - If two successive numbers (a_i) and (a_{i+1}) are both greater than or equal to 1, then (a_{i+2} > a_i a_{i+1} ge 1). This implies that the sequence would be strictly increasing, which is impossible in a circular arrangement because it would eventually contradict the initial values. 3. **Maximum Number of Integers:**    - To avoid the sequence becoming strictly increasing, we need to ensure that not too many successive terms are integers. Specifically, if we have two successive integers, the next term must be greater than or equal to 1, leading to a contradiction.    - Therefore, at most every other term can be an integer. This gives us a maximum of ( leftlfloor frac{2024}{2} rightrfloor = 1012 ) integers. 4. **Checking Feasibility of 1012 Integers:**    - If we try to place 1012 integers in the sequence, we would have a pattern like (n_1, a_1, n_2, a_2, ldots, n_{1012}, a_{1012}), where (n_i) are integers and (a_i) are non-integer positive real numbers.    - However, this arrangement would still lead to a strictly increasing sequence of (a_i) values, which is not possible in a circular sequence. 5. **Feasibility of 1011 Integers:**    - We can place 1011 integers in the sequence such that the non-integer terms (a_i) can be chosen to prevent the sequence from becoming strictly increasing.    - For example, consider the sequence: (1, frac{1}{1012^2}, 1, frac{2}{1012^2}, 1, frac{3}{1012^2}, ldots, 1, frac{1011}{1012^2}, frac{1}{1012}, frac{1011.5}{1012^3}). This sequence satisfies the condition (a_i a_{i+1} < a_{i+2}) and does not become strictly increasing.

Consider (P_{n} = prod_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} = p_{1}^{alpha_{n,1}} p_{2}^{alpha_{n,2}} cdots p_{m}^{alpha_{n,m}}). 4. Define the vector (c_{n} = (r_{n,1}, r_{n,2}, cdots, r_{n,m})) where     [     r_{n,i} =      begin{cases}         0 & text{if } alpha_{n,i} text{ is even},          1 & text{if } alpha_{n,i} text{ is odd}.     end{cases}     ] 5. Since there are at most (2^m) distinct vectors (c_{n}) (as each (r_{n,i}) can be either 0 or 1), by the Pigeonhole Principle, among the elements (P_{2^{2016}-2^m}, P_{2^{2016}-2^m+1}, cdots, P_{2^{2016}}), which total (2^m + 1) elements, there must be at least two distinct indices (s) and (t) such that      [     2^{2016} - 2^m leq s < t leq 2^{2016}     ]     and (c_{s} = c_{t}). 6. This implies that the product (frac{P_{t}}{P_{s}} = prod_{i=s+1}^{t} a_{i} = b) must be an integer and all exponent components in (b) are even. Hence, (b) is a perfect square. 7. Let (P_{s} + 1 = u^2) and consequently, we can write (b = v^2). 8. Thus,     [     P_{t} + 1 = u^2 v^2 - v^2 + 1     ] 9. Now, since      [     P_{s} geq prod_{i=1}^{s} 2 = 2^{s} geq 2^{2^{2016}-2^m} > 2^{11 cdot 2^m} = 2048^{2m}     ]     and      [     b leq prod_{i=s+1}^{t} 2016 = 2016^{t-s} leq 2016^{2m}     ]     it follows that (u > v), because (2^{2^{2016}-2^m}) grows much faster than (2016^{2m}). 10. Therefore,     [     (uv-1)^2 < P_{t} + 1 = u^2 v^2 - v^2 + 1 < u^2 v^2.     ]     This implies a contradiction since (P_{t} + 1) was assumed to be a perfect square. By the contradiction, the initial assumption that all (a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{2^{2016}}) are greater than or equal to 2 must be false. Therefore, at least one of (a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{2^{2016}}) must be 1. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{At least one of } a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{2^{2016}} text{ must be 1.}} ]"},{"instruction":"the final game of the basketball season, four players scored points.

What is the value of A+B?","output":"To find the value of A+B, we need to determine the possible values of A and B that would make the six-digit number A4461B a multiple of 72. A multiple of 72 is also a multiple of both 8 and 9 (since 72 = 8 * 9), so the number must satisfy the divisibility rules for both 8 and 9. For a number to be divisible by 8, the last three digits must form a number that is divisible by 8. In this case, the last three digits are 61B. We need to find a value for B that makes 61B divisible by 8. For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. The sum of the digits in A4461B is A + 4 + 4 + 6 + 1 + B. Let's first find the possible values for B that make 61B divisible by 8. We can do this by checking the numbers 610, 611, 612, ..., 619 to see which are divisible by 8. - 610 ÷ 8 = 76 R 2 (not divisible) - 611 ÷ 8 = 76 R 3 (not divisible) - 612 ÷ 8 = 76 R 4 (not divisible) - 613 ÷ 8 = 76 R 5 (not divisible) - 614 ÷ 8 = 76 R 6 (not divisible) - 615 ÷ 8 = 76 R 7 (not divisible) - 616 ÷ 8 = 77 (divisible) - 617 ÷ 8 = 77 R 1 (not divisible) - 618 ÷ 8 = 77 R 2 (not divisible) - 619 ÷ 8 = 77 R 3 (not divisible) So, the only value for B that makes 61B divisible by 8 is 6. Now, let's find the possible values for A that make the sum of the digits divisible by 9. We already know that B is 6, so the sum of the digits is A + 4 + 4 + 6 + 1 + 6. This simplifies to A + 21. For A + 21 to be divisible by 9, A must be a number such that when added to 21, the result is a multiple of 9. The smallest multiple of 9 that is greater than 21 is 27, and the next is 36, then 45, and so on. Let's find the value of A by subtracting 21 from these multiples of 9: - 27 - 21 = 6 - 36 - 21 = 15 - 45 - 21 = 24 - ... The only single-digit value for A that makes A + 21 a multiple of 9 is 6 (since 6 + 21 = 27, which is a multiple of 9). Therefore, A is 6 and B is 6.

To determine the minimum possible sum that a traveler must spend on tickets, we start by understanding the setup provided:    - There are 4 southern cities and 5 northern cities.    - Each southern city is connected to each northern city. 2. Denote the southern cities as ( Y_1, Y_2, Y_3, Y_4 ) and the northern cities as ( S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4, S_5 ). 3. Given the information:    - A one-way ticket between any two connected cities costs ( N ) rubles.    - A round-trip ticket (with the \\"to and fro\\" route) costs ( 1.6N ) rubles. 4. The traveler starts in a southern city and intends to visit all southern cities and return to the start point. Since southern cities are not directly connected, the traveler must travel through northern cities. 5. To visit all southern cities:    - The traveler will need to take 2 times the number of southern cities trips. Given there are 4 southern cities, the total number of trips required is ( 2 times 4 = 8 ). 6. It's clear that any round-trip (a visit to another southern city via a northern city and returning back) can be achieved using a round-trip ticket costing ( 1.6N ) rubles. 7. The minimum possible cost will be realized if the traveler uses round-trip tickets efficiently:    - Each pair of trips across the 8 travels (for each visit and return) uses exactly 4 round-trip tickets.    - Therefore, the total cost will be ( 4 times 1.6N ). 8. Example route:    - Start at ( Y_1 ):      - ( Y_1 rightarrow S_1 rightarrow Y_2 rightarrow S_1 rightarrow Y_1 )      - ( Y_1 rightarrow S_1 rightarrow Y_3 rightarrow S_1 rightarrow Y_1 )      - ( Y_1 rightarrow S_1 rightarrow Y_4 rightarrow S_1 rightarrow Y_1 ) 9. Calculation of cost:    - Each round-trip (2 trips between a southern city via a northern city) uses 1.6N for 2 travels.    - Four such round-trips cover the required 8 trips.

We find that: a = ln 1.0201 > ln 1.02 = b Thus, a > b. **Step 2: Comparing a and c** To compare a and c, we define a function f(x) = 2ln(1+x) - (sqrt{1+4x} - 1), for 0 < x < 1. We substitute sqrt{1+4x} = t, which implies x = frac{t^2 - 1}{4}, and thus we get a new function in terms of t, g(t) = 2ln left(frac{t^2 + 3}{4}right) - t + 1. Differentiating g(t) with respect to t gives us g'(t) = frac{4t}{t^2 + 3} - 1, which simplifies to g'(t) = -frac{(t-1)(t-3)}{t^2 + 3}. Since 1 < t < sqrt{5}, g'(t) > 0, indicating g(t) is monotonically increasing in this interval. Therefore, f(x) > 0 for 0 < x < 1, which implies a > c. **Step 3: Comparing b and c** To compare b and c, we define another function h(x) = ln(1+2x) - (sqrt{1+4x} - 1), and again substitute sqrt{1+4x} = t, leading to x = frac{t^2 - 1}{4}. This gives us a new function varphi(t) = ln left(frac{t^2 + 1}{2}right) - t + 1. Differentiating varphi(t) with respect to t gives us varphi'(t) = frac{2t}{t^2 + 1} - 1, which simplifies to varphi'(t) = -frac{(t-1)^2}{t^2 + 1}. Since varphi'(t) < 0 for 1 < t < sqrt{5}, varphi(t) is monotonically decreasing in this interval. Therefore, h(x) < 0 for 0 < x < 1, which implies c > b. **Conclusion:** From the comparisons above, we have established that a > b, a > c, and c > b. Therefore, the correct order is a > c > b.

If a man is riding a horse, only the horse's 4 legs are touching the ground. If a man is walking, then there are 4 (horse's legs) + 2 (man's legs) = 6 legs touching the ground. The total number of legs walking on the ground is 80. We can set up the following equation: 4R (legs of the riding horses) + 6W (legs of the walking horses and men) = 80 Since the number of riding owners and walking owners adds up to the total number of owners, we have: R + W = 16 We can solve these two equations simultaneously.

First, let's multiply both sides by 1+i to get the equation in terms of m and n only: m = (1-ni)(1+i) When we multiply out the right side, we have to apply the distributive property: m = (1)(1) + (1)(i) - (ni)(1) - (ni)(i) m = 1 + i - ni - n(i^2) Since i^2 = -1, the equation then simplifies to: m = 1 + i - ni + n Next, we gather the real and imaginary parts separately, with m being a real number. This gives us: m = (n + 1) + (1 - n)i For two complex numbers to be equal, their corresponding real and imaginary parts must be equal. Thus, we can set up the following system of equations: begin{cases} m = n + 1    1 - n = 0 end{cases} The second equation, 1 - n = 0, gives us the value of n: n = 1 Putting the value of n back into the first equation, we get: m = 1 + 1 m = 2 Finally, we find the value of m + n: m + n = 2 + 1 m + n = 3 Therefore, the sum of m and n is: boxed{m + n = 3}"},{"instruction":"Four distinct digits a, b, c, and d (none consecutive and all different) are selected to form the fourdigit numbers abcd and dcba.

Unlike the consecutive digits case, here a, b, c, d are distinct and non-consecutive. The sum revisions do not simplify into a single expression involving only a or d, and since a+d and b+c are pairs with possibly different sums for each pair of a, b, c, d, the common divisor can change based on their selection.

We start with the given equation:    [    k + (k + 5) + (k + 10) + ldots + (k + 5(m - 1)) = 1372    ]    This is an arithmetic series with the first term (a = k) and the common difference (d = 5). 2. The sum of the first (m) terms of an arithmetic series is given by:    [    S_m = frac{m}{2} left(2a + (m - 1)dright)    ]    Here, (a = k) and (d = 5), so the sum becomes:    [    S_m = frac{m}{2} left(2k + (m - 1) cdot 5right)    ]    Simplifying further:    [    S_m = frac{m}{2} left(2k + 5m - 5right)    ]    Given that (S_m = 1372), we have:    [    frac{m}{2} left(2k + 5m - 5right) = 1372    ]    Multiplying both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:    [    m left(2k + 5m - 5right) = 2744    ] 3.

Since (k) must be an odd integer, the numerator (5m(m - 1) + 2744) must be even. Notice that (5m(m - 1)) is always even because (m(m - 1)) is the product of two consecutive integers, one of which is always even. Therefore, (5m(m - 1)) is even, and adding 2744 (which is even) keeps the numerator even. 5. We now need to check for which values of (m) the expression (frac{5m(m - 1) + 2744}{2m}) results in an odd integer. We start by factoring 2744:    [    2744 = 2^3 cdot 7^3    ]    We need to find (m) such that (5m(m - 1) + 2744) is divisible by (2m). 6.

To compare the size of the rectangle to the circle, we can calculate the ratio of their areas: Ratio = Area of rectangle / Area of circle Ratio = 50 cm² / 78.54 cm² Ratio ≈ 0.637 (rounded to three decimal places) This ratio tells us that the area of the rectangle is approximately 63.7% of the area of the circle. If you are asking for the dimensions of the rectangle, since the area of the rectangle is boxed{50}  cm², there are multiple possible dimensions for the rectangle that could result in this area. For example, the rectangle could be 10 cm by 5 cm, 25 cm by 2 cm, or any other combination of length and width that multiplies to 50 cm². Without additional information, we cannot determine the exact dimensions of the rectangle."},{"instruction":"A barrel of oil weighs 10 kilograms.

There are 13 hearts in a deck and only one 10 of hearts, leaving 12 possible hearts that are not 10s. Thus, the probability is dfrac{12}{52}. - Given that the first card is a heart but not a 10, there are now 51 cards left in the deck, and 4 of those are 10s (since the first card was not a 10). Therefore, the probability that the second card drawn is a 10 is dfrac{4}{51}. Multiplying these probabilities gives the total probability for Case 1: dfrac{12}{52} times dfrac{4}{51} **Case 2: The first card is the 10 heartsuit.** - The probability of drawing the 10 of hearts as the first card is simply the number of 10 of hearts over the total number of cards, which is dfrac{1}{52}. - Given that the first card was the 10 of hearts, there are now 51 cards left in the deck, and only 3 of those are 10s (since one 10 has already been drawn).

Simplifying further, we have: -6 + a leq 2x - a leq 6 - a, and after adding a to all parts, we get: a - 6 leq 2x leq 6. Dividing through by 2 leads to: frac{a - 6}{2} leq x leq 3.

Denote by t the length of the tangents from point M to each circle. 2. For the tangents from a common external point M to each circle, we have the following equalities based on the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the center of the circle, the point of tangency, and the point M:    [    O_1M^2 = t^2 + R^2    ]    [    O_2M^2 = t^2 + r^2    ] 3. Subtract the second equation from the first:    [    O_1M^2 - O_2M^2 = (t^2 + R^2) - (t^2 + r^2)    ] 4. Simplify the equation:    [    O_1M^2 - O_2M^2 = R^2 - r^2    ]    This equation indicates that the difference of the squares of the distances from M to the centers O_1 and O_2 is a constant value, specifically R^2 - r^2. 5. Recognize that a set of points that satisfy the relationship (O_1M^2 - O_2M^2) being constant is a hyperbola. However, if we take into account the perpendicular bisector of the segment (O_1O_2):    This relationship also coincides geometrically with the straight line that is perpendicular to (O_1O_2) and passing through the mid-point of the line segment connecting the two circle centers. 6. Therefore, the geometric locus of points M such that tangents drawn from M to the circles are equal in length is a line perpendicular to (O_1O_2). 7. Given specific cases:    - If the circles are situated with neither circle inside the other, then the entire perpendicular bisector line is considered.    - If one circle is entirely within the other, we only consider part of this perpendicular bisector line as being valid for external points M. # Conclusion: The geometric locus of points M such that the tangents drawn from M to the given circles are equal is a line perpendicular to the line segment (O_1O_2). This complete perpendicular line is valid when the circles do not intersect or overlap externally; otherwise, part of this line applies if one circle is entirely within the other.  blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Prove that for the same integers x and y, both 2x + 3y and 9x + 5y can be simultaneously divisible by 17.","output":"1.

Let this integer be (s):    [    frac{k - y}{2} = s implies y = k - 2s    ]    Therefore, substituting (y) back, we get:    [    x = - (k - 2s) + s = 3s - k    ] 3.

Boat A can take up to 20 people during one trip, while Boat B can take up to 15 people during one trip. On the second day, Boat A can only make 5 trips, while Boat B can make 6 trips. How many people can both the boats transport in these 2 days?","output":"To calculate the total number of people both boats can transport in two days, we need to calculate the number of people each boat can transport per day and then add them together. On the first day: Boat A can take 20 people per trip and makes 7 trips, so it can transport 20 * 7 = 140 people. Boat B can take 15 people per trip and makes 5 trips, so it can transport 15 * 5 = 75 people. On the second day: Boat A can take 20 people per trip and makes 5 trips, so it can transport 20 * 5 = 100 people. Boat B can take 15 people per trip and makes 6 trips, so it can transport 15 * 6 = 90 people. Now, we add the number of people transported by each boat on each day: First day total = Boat A (140 people) + Boat B (75 people) = 140 + 75 = 215 people. Second day total = Boat A (100 people) + Boat B (90 people) = 100 + 90 = 190 people. Finally, we add the totals from both days to get the overall total: Total people transported in two days = First day total (215 people) + Second day total (190 people) = 215 + 190 = 405 people. Therefore, both boats can transport a total of boxed{405}  people in two days."},{"instruction":"The sum of 19 consecutive positive integers is twice a perfect square. What is the smallest possible value of this sum?","output":"Let's consider the 19 consecutive integers (n, n+1, dots, n+18). The sum of these integers can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is the average of the first and last term multiplied by the number of terms. Thus, the sum is: [ frac{n + (n + 18)}{2} cdot 19 = frac{2n + 18}{2} cdot 19 = (n+9)cdot 19. ] We are given that this sum is twice a perfect square. Therefore, we can express this condition as: [ (n+9)cdot 19 = 2k^2 ] where (k^2) is a perfect square. We need to find the smallest (n) for which (19(n+9)) is twice a perfect square. Simplifying further, we can write: [ n + 9 = frac{2k^2}{19}, ] considering that the smallest (k) such that (2k^2) is divisible by 19 and (2k^2/19) is an integer plus 9. We start examining possible (k) values. We find (k = 19m) such that (2(19m)^2 = 722m^2) and (722m^2/19 = 38m^2) which is an integer. Therefore, the smallest value happens when (m = 1): [ n + 9 = 38 implies n = 29. ] Substituting (n = 29) into our sum gives: [ (29 + 9) cdot 19 = 38 cdot 19 = 722. ] We confirm that (722 = 2 times 19^2), so it is indeed twice a perfect square.

Regarding the curve C, the parameter equations represent a circle centered at the origin (0, 0) with a radius of 2, which can be written as x^2 + y^2 = 4. To find the distance between the center of the circle and the line l, we use the point-to-line distance formula: d = frac{|ax_0 + by_0 + c|}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} where a, b, and c are the coefficients of the linear equation ax + by + c = 0, and (x_0, y_0) is the point for which we are finding the distance to the line. In this case, the circle center (0, 0) gives: d = frac{|1 cdot 0 - 1 cdot 0 - 2|}{sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2}} = frac{2}{sqrt{2}} = sqrt{2}  The length of the chord AB intersecting a circular arc can be found with the formula: |AB| = 2sqrt{r^2 - d^2} where r is the radius of the circle, and d is the distance from the center of the circle to the chord. Substituting r = 2 and d = sqrt{2}, we get: |AB| = 2sqrt{2^2 - (sqrt{2})^2} = 2sqrt{4 - 2} = 2sqrt{2} Thus, boxed{|AB| = 2sqrt{2}}."},{"instruction":"From the given diagram, calculate the positive difference in the xcoordinates when lines l and m reach y = 20.

Line l passes through points (0,5) and (3,0), giving a slope of:  text{slope of } l = frac{0 - 5}{3 - 0} = -frac{5}{3}.  Therefore, the equation of line l is:  y = -frac{5}{3}x + 5.  Line m passes through points (0,2) and (7,0), yielding a slope of:  text{slope of } m = frac{0 - 2}{7 - 0} = -frac{2}{7}.  Thus, the equation of line m is:  y = -frac{2}{7}x + 2.  To find the x-coordinates at which l and m intersect with y = 20, substitute y = 20 into both equations and solve for x: For l:  20 = -frac{5}{3}x + 5   15 = -frac{5}{3}x   x = -frac{15 cdot 3}{5} = -9.  For m:  20 = -frac{2}{7}x + 2   18 = -frac{2}{7}x   x = -frac{18 cdot 7}{2} = -63.  The positive difference in x-coordinates is:  |-63 - (-9)| = | -63 + 9 | = 54.

Similarly, take PB', PC', PD' equal and parallel to BC, CD, DA respectively.

Similarly:      - (PBB'C) forms a parallelogram where (PB' parallel BC) and (PB' = BC).      - (PCC'D) forms a parallelogram where (PC' parallel CD) and (PC' = CD).      - (PDD'A) forms a parallelogram where (PD' parallel DA) and (PD' = DA). 3. **Area Calculations of Triangles**:    - Note that in parallelograms (PAA'B), (PBB'C), (PCC'D), and (PDD'A), each contains a triangle (specifically (PAA'), (PBB'), (PCC'), and (PDD')).    - Each triangle shares a base with one side of the original quadrilateral (ABCD) and is height equivalent because they are derived from parallelograms sharing sides with quadrilateral (ABCD). 4. **Equivalence of Areas**:    - The triangles (PAA'), (PBB'), (PCC'), and (PDD') are congruent to triangles (ABC), (BCD), (CDA), and (DAB), respectively, because the corresponding sides are equal and the angles are effectively the same or supplementary (leading to equal areas due to equal base and height or supplementary condition ensuring equal areas).

With 7 scores, the 4th score is the median because it's in the middle, with 3 scores on either side.    - **Mean**: The mean is the average of the scores, which doesn't necessarily help Xiaohong know if he's in the top 3 unless he knows all the scores.    - **Mode**: The mode is the most frequently occurring score, which is irrelevant here since all scores are different.    - **Variance**: Variance measures the spread of the scores, which also doesn't directly help Xiaohong know his position relative to the top 3. 3. **Determining the Necessary Information**:    - Since Xiaohong wants to know if he can enter the top 3, he needs to compare his score to the scores that define the top 3 boundary.
