Determine whether G contains a Hamiltonian cycle or not. If G contains a Hamiltonian cycle, show the cycle on the graph.","output":"To determine whether the graph G contains a Hamiltonian cycle, we need more information about the specific connections between the vertices. A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. However, we can analyze the general properties of a graph with 6 vertices and 8 edges to see if it is likely to contain a Hamiltonian cycle. A graph with 6 vertices can have a maximum of 15 edges (when it is a complete graph). In this case, we have 8 edges, which is slightly more than half of the maximum possible edges. This means that the graph is not very sparse, increasing the likelihood of a Hamiltonian cycle. Additionally, we can use Dirac's theorem as a sufficient condition for the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle. Dirac's theorem states that if a graph G has n vertices (n ≥ 3) and the degree of each vertex is at least n/2, then G has a Hamiltonian cycle. In our case, n = 6, so n/2 = 3. If each vertex has a degree of at least 3, then according to Dirac's theorem, the graph G would have a Hamiltonian cycle. However, without more information about the specific connections between vertices, we cannot definitively determine whether G contains a Hamiltonian cycle or not. If you provide the specific connections between the vertices, we can determine the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle and show it on the graph."},{"instruction":"a graph G with 7 vertices and 9 edges, can you find a Hamiltonian cycle? If yes, illustrate the cycle. If not, explain why.","output":"To determine if a Hamiltonian cycle exists in a graph G with 7 vertices and 9 edges, we need to consider the degree of each vertex. A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. A necessary condition for a graph to have a Hamiltonian cycle is that each vertex must have a degree of at least 2. This is because, in a Hamiltonian cycle, each vertex must be connected to two other vertices (one before and one after it in the cycle). However, this condition is not sufficient to guarantee the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle. For example, consider a graph with 7 vertices (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) and the following edges: 1. A-B 2. B-C 3. C-D 4. D-E 5. E-F 6. F-G 7. G-A 8. A-C 9. E-G This graph has 9 edges, and each vertex has a degree of at least 2. However, there is no Hamiltonian cycle in this graph. To see this, note that if we start at vertex A, we can go to B, C, D, E, and F, but then we cannot go to G without retracing an edge (F-G or E-G), and we cannot return to A without skipping G.

However, Alex's proposal is not fair, as he gets 60 and Bob gets only 40. 3. Negotiation: Before making a decision, Bob could try to negotiate with Alex for a more equitable division of the money. For example, he could propose a 50-50 split or another division that is more favorable to him. 4. Relationship: If Alex and Bob have a good relationship, Bob might consider accepting the proposal to maintain harmony. However, if their relationship is not strong, Bob might be more inclined to reject the proposal or negotiate for a better deal. Taking these factors into account, my strategy as Bob would be to first attempt to negotiate with Alex for a more equitable division of the money. If Alex is unwilling to compromise, I would weigh the importance of the relationship and the opportunity cost of rejecting the proposal.

Let x be the amount the first player offers, and let y be the probability that the second player accepts the offer. We can express the relationship between x and y as a linear equation: y = k * x where k is a constant of proportionality. To find the value of k, we can use the fact that if the first player offers the entire 100, the second player will definitely accept the proposal (100% chance). So when x = 100, y = 1: 1 = k * 100 k = 1/100 = 0.01 Now we can use this value of k to find the smallest amount the first player should offer to have a 60% chance of the proposal being accepted.

In a Nash equilibrium, no player can benefit from changing their strategy, given the other player's strategy.

This is because Player 2 would prefer to accept any amount greater than 0 rather than rejecting the offer and getting nothing. In practice, the optimal percentage to offer may be higher than the smallest possible amount, as people tend to have fairness concerns and may reject offers that they perceive as unfair.

Let's consider the strategies of both players: Player 1's strategy: Propose a division of the 50 (x for Player 1 and 50-x for Player 2, where 0 ≤ x ≤ 50). Player 2's strategy: Set a minimum acceptable offer (y, where 0 ≤ y ≤ 50) and accept any offer greater than or equal to y, and reject any offer less than y. In order for a Nash equilibrium to occur, Player 1 needs to propose an offer that Player 2 will accept, and Player 2 needs to have no incentive to change their minimum acceptable offer. Player 1 knows that if they propose an offer that is less than Player 2's minimum acceptable offer, they will get nothing. Therefore, Player 1's best strategy is to propose an offer that is just equal to or slightly greater than Player 2's minimum acceptable offer. Player 2 knows that if they set their minimum acceptable offer too high, they risk getting nothing. However, if they set it too low, they may get less than they could have. In this game, the Nash equilibrium occurs when Player 2 sets their minimum acceptable offer as low as possible, which is 0. So, the Nash equilibrium in this ultimatum game is when Player 1 proposes a division of the 50 such that they keep almost the entire amount (x ≈ 50) and offers a very small amount to Player 2 (50-x ≈ 0). Player 2 accepts this offer because it is greater than or equal to their minimum acceptable offer of 0, and neither player has an incentive to change their strategy."},{"instruction":"Suppose there are two players in an Ultimatum Game, player A and player B.

The woman, however, could deviate to Concert and increase her utility from 2 to 3. - In outcome 5 (Concert-Concert), the woman has no incentive to deviate since she gets her highest utility (4). The man, however, could deviate to Tennis and increase his utility from 2 to 3. - In outcome 9 (Movie-Movie), neither the man nor the woman has an incentive to deviate, as they both get a utility of 3, which is higher than their utilities in any other strategy combination. Therefore, the Nash equilibrium of this game is the Movie-Movie strategy combination, where both the man and the woman choose to watch a movie together."},{"instruction":"the Battle of the Sexes game, John and Jane are trying to decide whether to go to the opera or the football game.

Similarly, if she always chooses football, she is not maximizing her own preference for ballet.

Let q be the probability that the husband chooses football, and (1-q) be the probability that he chooses ballet. The expected payoff for the wife when she chooses ballet is 2(1-q) + 1q, and the expected payoff when she chooses football is 1(1-q) + 2q. To make the husband indifferent between choosing football or ballet, these payoffs should be equal: 2(1-q) + 1q = 1(1-q) + 2q Solving for q, we get: 2 - 2q + q = 1 - q + 2q q = 1/3 Now, we can find the optimal probability for the wife to choose ballet (p) by making the husband indifferent between choosing football or ballet. The expected payoff for the husband when he chooses football is 2p + 1(1-p), and the expected payoff when he chooses ballet is 1p + 2(1-p). Setting these payoffs equal: 2p + 1(1-p) = 1p + 2(1-p) Solving for p, we get: 2p + 1 - p = p + 2 - 2p p = 1/3 So, the optimal mixed strategy for the wife is to choose ballet with a probability of 1/3 and football with a probability of 2/3.

To find the optimal mixed strategy, we can use the following method: Let p be the probability that the husband goes to the ballet and (1-p) be the probability that he goes to the football game.

We can do this by taking the partial derivatives of the expected payoffs with respect to p and q and setting them equal to zero: ∂M/∂p = 3q - 2(1-q) - q = 0 ∂W/∂q = 2p - 3(1-p) - p = 0 Solving these equations, we get: p = 3/5 q = 2/5 So, the optimal mixed strategy for the man is to watch the football game with probability 3/5 and go to the movie with probability 2/5. The optimal mixed strategy for the woman is to watch the football game with probability 2/5 and go to the movie with probability 3/5.

The man thinks there's a 60% chance the woman will prefer the opera, so there's a 40% chance she will prefer the baseball game. The woman thinks there's a 70% chance the man will prefer the baseball game, so there's a 30% chance he will prefer the opera.

John chooses the burger joint, and Jane chooses the sushi place.    - If Jane is not wearing her red dress, John gets his choice (burger joint) and his payoff is 5, while Jane's payoff is 0.    - If Jane is wearing her red dress, Jane gets her choice (sushi place) and her payoff is 5, while John's payoff is 0. 2. John chooses the sushi place, and Jane chooses the burger joint.    - If Jane is not wearing her red dress, John gets his choice (sushi place) and his payoff is 0, while Jane's payoff is 0.    - If Jane is wearing her red dress, Jane gets her choice (burger joint) and her payoff is 0, while John's payoff is 0. 3. Both John and Jane choose the burger joint.    - Regardless of whether Jane is wearing her red dress or not, they both go to the burger joint, and John's payoff is 5, while Jane's payoff is 0. 4. Both John and Jane choose the sushi place.    - Regardless of whether Jane is wearing her red dress or not, they both go to the sushi place, and John's payoff is 0, while Jane's payoff is 5. Now, let's find the Nash equilibrium by identifying the strategies where no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy. - In scenario 1, if John switches to choosing the sushi place, his payoff remains 0. If Jane switches to choosing the burger joint, her payoff remains 0. So, no player can improve their payoff by changing their strategy. - In scenario 2, if John switches to choosing the burger joint, his payoff increases to 5. If Jane switches to choosing the sushi place, her payoff remains 0. So, John can improve his payoff by changing his strategy. - In scenario 3, if John switches to choosing the sushi place, his payoff decreases to 0. If Jane switches to choosing the sushi place, her payoff increases to 5. So, Jane can improve her payoff by changing her strategy. - In scenario 4, if John switches to choosing the burger joint, his payoff increases to 5. If Jane switches to choosing the burger joint, her payoff remains 0. So, John can improve his payoff by changing his strategy. The only scenario where no player can improve their payoff by changing their strategy is scenario 1. Therefore, the Nash equilibrium is when John chooses the burger joint, and Jane chooses the sushi place. The optimal strategy for John is to always choose the burger joint, as this guarantees him a payoff of 5. The optimal strategy for Jane depends on whether she is wearing her red dress or not. If she is wearing her red dress, she should choose the sushi place, as this guarantees her a payoff of 5. If she is not wearing her red dress, her choice does not matter, as she will always get a payoff of 0."},{"instruction":"A couple is trying to decide on where to go on vacation - either a beach resort or a mountain resort. The wife prefers the beach resort and the husband prefers the mountain resort. They both rank their choices as follows:  - Wife's preference: Beach resort (1), Mountain resort (2) - Husband's preference: Mountain resort (1), Beach resort (2) If they end up going to the beach resort, the wife will receive a payoff of 5 and the husband will receive a payoff of 2. If they end up going to the mountain resort, the wife will receive a payoff of 2 and the husband will receive a payoff of 5.  What is the Nash equilibrium in this scenario and what are the payoffs for both the wife and husband in the Nash equilibrium?","output":"In this scenario, we can create a payoff matrix to represent the couple's preferences: \`\`\`                      Husband                 Beach      Mountain                --------------------- Wife  | Beach  | (5, 2)  | (5, 5)       |        |         |       | Mountain | (2, 2)  | (2, 5) \`\`\` A Nash equilibrium occurs when neither player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy. In this case, we can see that: 1. If the wife chooses the beach resort and the husband chooses the mountain resort, neither of them can improve their payoff by changing their choice. The wife would get a payoff of 2 if she switched to the mountain resort, and the husband would get a payoff of 2 if he switched to the beach resort. So, (Beach, Mountain) is a Nash equilibrium with payoffs (5, 5). 2. If the wife chooses the mountain resort and the husband chooses the beach resort, neither of them can improve their payoff by changing their choice. The wife would get a payoff of 5 if she switched to the beach resort, and the husband would get a payoff of 5 if he switched to the mountain resort.

If they choose different activities, Sarah prefers the concert (she receives a payoff of 4) while John prefers the movie (he receives a payoff of 2). If Sarah and John use a mixed strategy, where they randomly choose each activity with a certain probability, what is the probability that they both choose the same activity and receive a payoff of 3?","output":"Let p be the probability that Sarah chooses to watch a movie, and q be the probability that John chooses to watch a movie. Then, the probability that Sarah chooses to go to a concert is (1-p), and the probability that John chooses to go to a concert is (1-q). In a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, both players should be indifferent between their two choices. This means that the expected payoffs for each player should be the same for both activities. For Sarah, the expected payoff for watching a movie is 3q (since she gets a payoff of 3 if John also chooses the movie) and the expected payoff for going to a concert is 4(1-q) (since she gets a payoff of 4 if John chooses the movie). Setting these two equal, we get: 3q = 4(1-q) For John, the expected payoff for watching a movie is 2(1-p) (since he gets a payoff of 2 if Sarah chooses the concert) and the expected payoff for going to a concert is 3p (since he gets a payoff of 3 if Sarah also chooses the concert). Setting these two equal, we get: 2(1-p) = 3p Now, we can solve these two equations for p and q: 3q = 4 - 4q 7q = 4 q = 4/7 2 - 2p = 3p 5p = 2 p = 2/5 Now that we have the probabilities p and q, we can find the probability that they both choose the same activity: P(both choose M) = pq = (2/5)(4/7) = 8/35 P(both choose C) = (1-p)(1-q) = (3/5)(3/7) = 9/35 The probability that they both choose the same activity is the sum of these probabilities: P(both choose the same activity) = P(both choose M) + P(both choose C) = 8/35 + 9/35 = 17/35 So, the probability that Sarah and John both choose the same activity and receive a payoff of 3 is 17/35."},{"instruction":"the Battle of the Sexes game, Tom and Jane each independently choose a location for their date night.

To find the probability that they both choose the same movie, we can calculate the probability that they both choose the romantic comedy and the probability that they both choose the action movie, and then add those probabilities together. Probability that both choose Romantic Comedy: Amy chooses Romantic Comedy: 1/2 Bob chooses Romantic Comedy: 1/2 Probability (Amy and Bob choose Romantic Comedy) = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 Probability that both choose Action Movie: Amy chooses Action Movie: 1/2 Bob chooses Action Movie: 1/2 Probability (Amy and Bob choose Action Movie) = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 Probability that they choose the same movie = Probability (Romantic Comedy) + Probability (Action Movie) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 2/4 = 1/2 So, the probability that Amy and Bob will end up watching the same movie is 1/2 or 50%."},{"instruction":"A couple wants to go out for dinner, but they cannot decide between Italian or Chinese cuisine.

To do this, we can take the partial derivatives with respect to p and q and set them equal to 0: ∂(Total payoff) / ∂p = 0 ∂(Total payoff) / ∂q = 0 Solving these equations, we get: p = 1/2 q = 1/2 So, the optimal strategy for the couple is to randomly choose Italian with a probability of 1/2 and Chinese with a probability of 1/2.

If Player 2 swerves, Player 1 should stay straight to get a payoff of 2 instead of 0. 2. If Player 2 stays straight, Player 1 should swerve to get a payoff of -1 instead of -5. Now, let's analyze Player 2's options: 1. If Player 1 swerves, Player 2 should stay straight to get a payoff of 2 instead of 0. 2. If Player 1 stays straight, Player 2 should swerve to get a payoff of -1 instead of -5. There is no pure strategy Nash equilibrium in this game, as each player's optimal strategy depends on the other player's choice.

To be indifferent between swerving and not swerving, Bob should choose q such that: 200(1-p) = -100p Solving for p, we get: p = 2/3 So, in the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, both Alice and Bob should swerve with a probability of 2/3 and not swerve with a probability of 1/3. Now, let's calculate the expected payoffs for Alice and Bob in this mixed strategy Nash equilibrium: Expected payoff for Alice = p(200(1-q)) + (1-p)(-100q) = (2/3)(200(1/3)) + (1/3)(-100(2/3)) = 100 Expected payoff for Bob = q(200(1-p)) + (1-q)(-100p) = (2/3)(200(1/3)) + (1/3)(-100(2/3)) = 100 So, in the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, both Alice and Bob can expect a payoff of 100 points."},{"instruction":"Two drivers, A and B, are heading towards each other on a straight road.

If both drivers swerve, the game ends in a tie and neither driver receives a prize. Assuming that both A and B are rational and want to maximize their chance of winning, what is the optimal strategy for each driver to follow? Assigning the rewards:  If both drivers swerve, the payoff is 0 for each.  If one driver swerves and the other doesn't, the one who doesn't swerve gets a payoff of 5, and the one who swerves gets a payoff of -5.

Both drivers swerve (S, S) 2. Driver A swerves, and driver B goes straight (S, N) 3. Driver A goes straight, and driver B swerves (N, S) 4. Both drivers go straight (N, N) Now, we can create a payoff matrix using the given rewards: |   | Swerve (B) | Straight (B) | |---|------------|--------------| | Swerve (A) | (0, 0)    | (-5, 5)     | | Straight (A) | (5, -5)   | (0, 0)      | Now, let's analyze the matrix to determine the optimal strategy for each driver: For driver A: - If driver B swerves, driver A should go straight (5 > 0). - If driver B goes straight, driver A should swerve (-5 > 0). For driver B: - If driver A swerves, driver B should go straight (5 > 0). - If driver A goes straight, driver B should swerve (-5 > 0). However, this situation creates a paradox, as both drivers would want to swerve if the other goes straight and vice versa. This is an example of a game theory problem with no pure strategy Nash equilibrium. To find a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, we can use probabilities. Let p be the probability that driver A swerves, and q be the probability that driver B swerves. Then, the expected payoffs for each driver are: Expected payoff for A = p * (1 - q) * (-5) + (1 - p) * q * 5 Expected payoff for B = q * (1 - p) * (-5) + (1 - q) * p * 5 For each driver to be indifferent between swerving and going straight, their expected payoffs must be equal. Therefore, we can set the expected payoffs equal to each other and solve for p and q: p * (1 - q) * (-5) + (1 - p) * q * 5 = q * (1 - p) * (-5) + (1 - q) * p * 5 Simplifying and solving for p and q, we get: p = 1/2 q = 1/2 So, the optimal mixed strategy for each driver is to swerve with a probability of 1/2 and go straight with a probability of 1/2. This ensures that both drivers have an equal chance of winning the prize and avoids the paradox of always wanting to swerve or go straight based on the other driver's actions."},{"instruction":"the game of Chicken, two players drive their cars towards each other.

If Alice plays Straight, Bob's best response is to Swerve if L > -D (Bob prefers winning L over losing D). If L <= -D, Bob is indifferent between Swerving and playing Straight. 2. If Alice plays Swerve, Bob's best response is to play Straight if W > 0 (Bob prefers winning W over a tie). 3. If Bob plays Straight, Alice's best response is to Swerve if L > -D (Alice prefers winning L over losing D). If L <= -D, Alice is indifferent between Swerving and playing Straight. 4. If Bob plays Swerve, Alice's best response is to play Straight if W > 0 (Alice prefers winning W over a tie). Now, let's find the Nash equilibrium by combining the best responses: - If L > -D and W > 0, the Nash equilibrium is (Swerve, Straight) for Alice and Bob, respectively. In this case, Alice swerves and wins W dollars, while Bob loses L dollars. - If L <= -D and W > 0, there is no pure strategy Nash equilibrium, as both players are indifferent between Swerving and playing Straight. In this case, the game may have a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, where each player randomizes between Swerving and playing Straight with certain probabilities. - If L > -D and W <= 0, both players will choose to Swerve, resulting in a Nash equilibrium of (Swerve, Swerve) with payoffs (0, 0) for Alice and Bob, respectively. - If L <= -D and W <= 0, there is no pure strategy Nash equilibrium, as both players are indifferent between Swerving and playing Straight. In this case, the game may have a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, where each player randomizes between Swerving and playing Straight with certain probabilities.

Player A does not swerve, and Player B does not swerve (they crash). Let's calculate the probability of each outcome: 1. P(A swerves, B swerves) = P(A swerves) * P(B swerves) = 0.3 * 0.6 = 0.18 2. P(A swerves, B does not swerve) = P(A swerves) * P(B does not swerve) = 0.3 * (1 - 0.6) = 0.3 * 0.4 = 0.12 3.

A swerves, B swerves: Both players lose, so the payoff for each player is 0. 2. A swerves, B does not swerve: Player A loses, and Player B wins. The payoff for Player A is 0, and the payoff for Player B is 1000. 3. A does not swerve, B swerves: Player A wins, and Player B loses. The payoff for Player A is 1000, and the payoff for Player B is 0. 4. A does not swerve, B does not swerve: Both players crash, so the payoff for each player is -1000.

Since both Tom and Jerry are driving towards each other at a speed of 50 km/h, their combined speed is 100 km/h. We need to convert this speed to meters per second to match the distance unit: 100 km/h * (1000 m/km) * (1 h/3600 s) = 27.78 m/s (approximately) Now, we can find the time it takes for them to reach the point of collision: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 500 m / 27.78 m/s Time ≈ 18 seconds Assuming they want to swerve at the last possible moment to avoid crashing, they should begin swerving when they are only a fraction of a second away from the collision point. Let's say they want to swerve 0.5 seconds before the collision: Swerving time = 18 s - 0.5 s = 17.5 s Now, we can find the distance they have traveled in 17.5 seconds: Distance = Speed * Time Distance = 27.78 m/s * 17.5 s Distance ≈ 486.65 meters So, Tom and Jerry should begin swerving when they are about 486.65 meters apart to avoid crashing."},{"instruction":"ere's a precise numerical problem based on the Chicken Game in Game Theory: Two players, Alex and Bailey, are racing towards each other in their cars.

Therefore, the expected payoff for Driver A when swerving is: (-1 * 0.4) + (2 * 0.6) = -0.4 + 1.2 = 0.8 Expected Payoff for Driving Straight: If Driver A drives straight, the possible outcomes are (-5, 2) and (0, 0). The probabilities of these outcomes are the same as before: 0.4 for Driver B swerving and 0.6 for Driver B driving straight. Therefore, the expected payoff for Driver A when driving straight is: (-5 * 0.4) + (0 * 0.6) = -2 + 0 = -2 Comparing the expected payoffs, we can see that the expected payoff for swerving (0.8) is higher than the expected payoff for driving straight (-2).

If both players swerve, the game ends in a draw, and each player receives a payoff of 0. If neither player swerves, the game ends in a catastrophic collision, and each player receives a payoff of -10. If one player swerves and the other does not, the player who does not swerve receives a payoff of 2, while the player who swerves receives a payoff of 1. Now, suppose that two drivers, Alice and Bob, are playing a game of \\"Chicken.\\" Alice has a higher tolerance for risk than Bob, and will only swerve if she sees that Bob is not going to swerve. Bob is more cautious, and will always swerve if he sees that Alice is not going to swerve. What are the best strategies for Alice and Bob to maximize their payoffs?

If Alice swerves (S), Bob's best response is not to swerve (N) since 2 > 0. 4. If Alice does not swerve (N), Bob's best response is to swerve (S) since 1 > -10. The Nash equilibrium occurs when both players choose their best response to the other player's strategy. In this case, there are two Nash equilibria: 1. Alice swerves (S) and Bob does not swerve (N), resulting in payoffs of (1, 2). 2. Alice does not swerve (N) and Bob swerves (S), resulting in payoffs of (2, 1). Since Alice has a higher tolerance for risk, she is more likely to choose not to swerve (N), while Bob, being more cautious, is more likely to choose to swerve (S). Therefore, the most likely Nash equilibrium in this game is when Alice does not swerve (N) and Bob swerves (S), with payoffs of (2, 1)."},{"instruction":"Two players are playing the Chicken Game.

However, there is a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, where each player chooses to swerve with a certain probability (p) and continue straight ahead with a probability (1-p).

Expected payoff for Alice = (0.5 * 100) + (0.5 * collision_payoff) Expected payoff for Bob = (0.5 * -50) + (0.5 * collision_payoff) Without knowing the payoff for a collision, we can only partially calculate the expected payoffs: Expected payoff for Alice = 50 + 0.5 * collision_payoff Expected payoff for Bob = -25 + 0.5 * collision_payoff"},{"instruction":"Let's say two drivers are playing the game of Chicken, where they drive towards each other and the first one to swerve loses.

A Nash equilibrium is a stable state in which no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy, given the other player's strategy. Let's consider the possible strategies and their payoffs: 1. Player A swerves, Player B swerves: (0, 0) 2. Player A swerves, Player B does not swerve: (-1, 3) 3. Player A does not swerve, Player B swerves: (3, -1) 4. Player A does not swerve, Player B does not swerve: (-10, -10) Now, let's look for Nash equilibria: - In strategy 1, both players receive a payoff of 0. If either player unilaterally changes their strategy to not swerving, their payoff would increase to 3. Therefore, this is not a Nash equilibrium. - In strategy 2, Player A receives a payoff of -1 and Player B receives a payoff of 3. If Player A changes their strategy to not swerving, their payoff would increase to -10, which is worse. If Player B changes their strategy to swerving, their payoff would decrease to 0, which is worse. Therefore, this is a Nash equilibrium. - In strategy 3, Player A receives a payoff of 3 and Player B receives a payoff of -1. If Player A changes their strategy to swerving, their payoff would decrease to 0, which is worse. If Player B changes their strategy to not swerving, their payoff would increase to -10, which is worse. Therefore, this is a Nash equilibrium. - In strategy 4, both players receive a payoff of -10. If either player unilaterally changes their strategy to swerving, their payoff would increase to -1. Therefore, this is not a Nash equilibrium. There are two Nash equilibria in this game: one where Player A swerves and Player B does not swerve (strategy 2), and another where Player A does not swerve and Player B swerves (strategy 3). Since both players are rational and have no prior relationship, they cannot coordinate their strategies. Therefore, the optimal strategy for each player is to randomize between swerving and not swerving, with the probability of each action depending on the other player's strategy. This is called a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium."},{"instruction":"ere's a math problem related to the Chicken Game: In the Chicken Game, two players, Ann and Bob, are driving towards each other in their cars.

Two hunters hunt a stag, one hunts a hare: The two stag hunters get nothing, and the hare hunter gets enough meat for two days. 3. All hunters hunt a hare: They all get enough meat to last for one day. In this situation, the Nash equilibrium occurs when all hunters choose to hunt a hare. This is because if any hunter deviates from this strategy and hunts a stag, they risk getting nothing if the other hunters don't also hunt a stag. By choosing to hunt a hare, each hunter guarantees themselves enough meat for one day, even if it's not the optimal outcome of having enough meat for a week. So, the best strategy for each hunter, without communication, is to hunt a hare."},{"instruction":"Consider a game of Stag Hunt where two hunters can either hunt a stag or a rabbit.

If both hunters hunt rabbits, they will both get 2 units of reward.

Both hunters hunt rabbits: They both get 2 units of reward. Player A hunted stag 6 times and rabbit 4 times. Player B hunted stag 8 times and rabbit 2 times. Now let's calculate the payoffs for each player: 1. Both hunters hunt stag: This happens when both Player A and Player B hunt stag. Player A hunted stag 6 times, and Player B hunted stag 8 times. They both hunted stag together in the same round a minimum of 6 times (since A hunted stag 6 times). In these 6 rounds, they both get 5 units of reward each, so the payoff for each player is 6 * 5 = 30 units. 2. One hunts stag, the other hunts rabbit: This can happen in two ways:    a. Player A hunts stag, and Player B hunts rabbit: This can happen 2 times (since Player B hunted rabbit 2 times). In these 2 rounds, Player A gets 0 units, and Player B gets 1 unit each time. So, the payoff for Player B is 2 * 1 = 2 units.    b. Player A hunts rabbit, and Player B hunts stag: This can happen 4 times (since Player A hunted rabbit 4 times). In these 4 rounds, Player A gets 1 unit each time, and Player B gets 0 units. So, the payoff for Player A is 4 * 1 = 4 units. 3. Both hunters hunt rabbits: This happens when both Player A and Player B hunt rabbits. Player A hunted rabbit 4 times, and Player B hunted rabbit 2 times. They both hunted rabbits together in the same round a minimum of 2 times (since B hunted rabbit 2 times). In these 2 rounds, they both get 2 units of reward each, so the payoff for each player is 2 * 2 = 4 units. Now let's add up the payoffs for each player: Player A: 30 (both hunt stag) + 4 (A hunts rabbit, B hunts stag) + 4 (both hunt rabbits) = 38 units Player B: 30 (both hunt stag) + 2 (A hunts stag, B hunts rabbit) + 4 (both hunt rabbits) = 36 units So, after the ten rounds of the game, Player A has a payoff of 38 units, and Player B has a payoff of 36 units."},{"instruction":"Suppose there are two individuals hunting together.

If Individual 1 chooses to hunt a hare, Individual 2 should still choose to hunt a stag, as they will get a reward of 15 instead of 5. The same logic applies for Individual 1's choices based on Individual 2's actions. However, since both individuals are rational and want to maximize their rewards, they will recognize that coordinating to hunt a stag (S,S) will result in the highest combined reward of 20 (10 for each individual).

To determine the best strategy for each hunter, we can create a payoff matrix: \`\`\`                Hunter 2                Stag    Rabbit Hunter 1  Stag    (18,18)  (0,8)           Rabbit  (8,0)    (2,2) \`\`\` In this matrix, the first number in each cell represents the payoff for Hunter 1, and the second number represents the payoff for Hunter 2. If both hunters choose to go for the stag, they will each get 18 points. If one hunter chooses to go for the stag and the other chooses to go for the rabbit, the hunter going for the stag will get 0 points, and the hunter going for the rabbit will get 8 points. If both hunters choose to go for the rabbit, they will each get 2 points. The best strategy for each hunter depends on their beliefs about what the other hunter will do. If a hunter believes that the other hunter will go for the stag, then their best strategy is to also go for the stag, as they will get 18 points instead of 0. If a hunter believes that the other hunter will go for the rabbit, then their best strategy is to also go for the rabbit, as they will get 2 points instead of 0. In the absence of communication, the hunters may choose to play it safe and go for the rabbit, as this guarantees a positive payoff. However, if they can establish trust or have a history of cooperation, they may choose to go for the stag, as this leads to a higher payoff for both hunters."},{"instruction":"ere's a problem for a math student studying Stag Hunt in Game Theory: Two hunters are out in the woods.

Both players hunt hare (1,1): If either player switches to hunting stag, their payoff will not increase (it stays at 1 for Player 1, and increases from 1 to 2 for Player 2, but Player 2 would prefer the 4 from hunting stag together).

Suppose we have a population of rabbits and foxes, and each individual can either hunt alone for a small prey (yielding a payoff of 2), or cooperate with a partner to hunt a larger prey (yielding a payoff of 4). However, if one individual chooses to cooperate and the other chooses to hunt alone, the cooperating individual receives no payoff while the individual hunting alone receives a payoff of 3. If both individuals choose to hunt alone, each receives a payoff of 1. Suppose that in the current generation, 60% of rabbits and 70% of foxes choose to hunt alone. What will be the proportions of rabbits and foxes choosing to hunt alone in the next generation if the game is played repeatedly and individuals imitate the strategy of their more successful neighbors?","output":"To determine the proportions of rabbits and foxes choosing to hunt alone in the next generation, we need to calculate the expected payoffs for each strategy (hunting alone or cooperating) for both rabbits and foxes. Let's first calculate the expected payoffs for rabbits: 1. If a rabbit hunts alone, it has a 60% chance of encountering another rabbit hunting alone and a 40% chance of encountering a rabbit cooperating. The expected payoff for hunting alone is (0.6 * 1) + (0.4 * 3) = 0.6 + 1.2 = 1.8. 2. If a rabbit cooperates, it has a 60% chance of encountering a rabbit hunting alone and a 40% chance of encountering a rabbit cooperating. The expected payoff for cooperating is (0.6 * 0) + (0.4 * 4) = 0 + 1.6 = 1.6. Since the expected payoff for hunting alone (1.8) is higher than the expected payoff for cooperating (1.6), more rabbits will choose to hunt alone in the next generation. We cannot determine the exact proportion without more information about the rate of imitation and the population size. Now let's calculate the expected payoffs for foxes: 1. If a fox hunts alone, it has a 70% chance of encountering another fox hunting alone and a 30% chance of encountering a fox cooperating. The expected payoff for hunting alone is (0.7 * 1) + (0.3 * 3) = 0.7 + 0.9 = 1.6. 2. If a fox cooperates, it has a 70% chance of encountering a fox hunting alone and a 30% chance of encountering a fox cooperating. The expected payoff for cooperating is (0.7 * 0) + (0.3 * 4) = 0 + 1.2 = 1.2. Since the expected payoff for hunting alone (1.6) is higher than the expected payoff for cooperating (1.2), more foxes will choose to hunt alone in the next generation. Again, we cannot determine the exact proportion without more information about the rate of imitation and the population size. In conclusion, in the next generation, the proportion of rabbits and foxes choosing to hunt alone will increase, but we cannot determine the exact proportions without additional information."},{"instruction":"Suppose two friends have agreed to go on a hunting trip.

However, if both of them hunt a hare, they can both eat but will not have the chance to share the larger meat of a stag. Suppose the payoff for hunting a stag together is 10 units of meat, while hunting a hare yields only 4 units. If the cost for each person to hunt is 2 units, what should they choose and why?","output":"To determine the best choice, we can analyze the possible outcomes and their respective payoffs. There are three possible scenarios: 1. Both friends hunt a stag. 2. One friend hunts a stag, and the other hunts a hare. 3. Both friends hunt a hare. Scenario 1: Both friends hunt a stag If both friends hunt a stag, they will share the 10 units of meat. Since there are two of them, each will get 5 units of meat. After accounting for the cost of hunting (2 units), each friend will have a net gain of 3 units of meat (5 - 2 = 3). Scenario 2: One friend hunts a stag, and the other hunts a hare In this scenario, the friend who hunts a hare will get 4 units of meat. After accounting for the cost of hunting (2 units), they will have a net gain of 2 units of meat (4 - 2 = 2). The friend who hunts a stag will go home empty-handed, so their net gain is -2 units of meat (0 - 2 = -2). Scenario 3: Both friends hunt a hare If both friends hunt a hare, they will each get 4 units of meat. After accounting for the cost of hunting (2 units), each friend will have a net gain of 2 units of meat (4 - 2 = 2). Comparing the scenarios, we can see that the best choice for both friends is to hunt a stag together (Scenario 1), as it results in the highest net gain of 3 units of meat for each friend. This choice requires cooperation and trust between the friends, as they both need to commit to hunting the stag to achieve the best outcome."},{"instruction":"a game of Stag Hunt, two hunters have to choose between hunting a stag or a hare. Hunting a stag requires the cooperation of both hunters and yields a payoff of 5 units of meat. Hunting a hare is an individual effort and yields a payoff of 2 units of meat. If both hunters hunt the stag, they both get 5 units of meat, but if one of them chooses to hunt a hare while the other hunts a stag, the hunter who hunts the hare gets 0 units of meat and the other hunter gets 5 units of meat.

If Alex hunts a hare and Ben hunts a stag, the payoff will be (5,0), meaning Alex gets 0 units of meat and Ben gets 5 units of meat. However, both hunters might consider the other possibilities to maximize their payoffs. If they both decide to cooperate and hunt the stag, they will both get a higher payoff of 5 units of meat each. Alternatively, if they both choose to hunt a hare, they will each get 2 units of meat. In this case, since Alex prefers to hunt a hare, he might stick to his preference, while Ben might consider switching to hunting a hare to avoid getting 0 units of meat. In conclusion, the outcome of the game depends on the hunters' decisions based on their preferences and the potential payoffs. If they cannot coordinate their actions, the most likely outcome is that Alex will hunt a hare and Ben will hunt a stag, resulting in a payoff of (0,5). However, if they can communicate and cooperate, they might both choose to hunt the stag for a higher payoff of (5,5) or both hunt a hare for a payoff of (2,2)."},{"instruction":"Consider two hunters hunting stags.

In this scenario, the land can only support 50 cows, so the total profit earned by all farmers would be 50 cows * 5 per cow = 250. Now, let's find the socially optimal number of cows to graze on the land. Since the land can support a maximum of 50 cows, the socially optimal number of cows would be 50 cows. In this case, the corresponding profit earned by all farmers would be 50 cows * 5 per cow = 250. To maintain this socially optimal number of cows on the land, each farmer would need to contribute by grazing fewer cows. Since there are 10 farmers and the land can support 50 cows, each farmer should graze 50 cows / 10 farmers = 5 cows on the land. Thus, each farmer would need to contribute by grazing only 5 cows on the land to maintain the socially optimal number of cows and the corresponding profit of 250 for all farmers."},{"instruction":"A group of 10 farmers share a plot of land to graze their cows. Each farmer has 5 cows. The plot of land can support a total of 40 cows. If any farmer exceeds their allotted 5 cows, the plot of land will be overgrazed, resulting in a loss of profit for everyone. Therefore, they must decide how many cows to graze on the plot of land. If each farmer adds one additional cow, they will earn an extra 1000 profit each. However, if all 10 farmers add an additional cow, the plot of land will be overgrazed and they will each lose 500. What should the farmers do to maximize their profit?","output":"Let's analyze the situation. Currently, there are 10 farmers with 5 cows each, which means there are 50 cows in total. The plot of land can support only 40 cows. So, they need to reduce the number of cows by 10 to avoid overgrazing. Now, let's consider the profit. If each farmer adds one additional cow, they will earn an extra 1000 profit each. However, if all 10 farmers add an additional cow, the plot of land will be overgrazed, and they will each lose 500. To maximize their profit, the farmers should work together to decide which 10 cows to remove from the plot of land. Once they have reduced the number of cows to 40, they can then each add one additional cow, earning an extra 1000 profit each without overgrazing the land.

The cost of operating a large boat is 200 per day and the cost of operating a small boat is 100 per day. However, if more than 5 fishermen use large boats, the overall catch for the group will be reduced by 50% due to overfishing, but it will not be reduced if fewer than 5 use large boats.  Suppose that each fisherman aims to maximize his individual profit. What is the optimal number of fishermen that should use a large boat, and what will be the profit of each of these fishermen?","output":"Let's analyze the different scenarios to find the optimal number of fishermen using large boats to maximize individual profit. Case 1: 5 or fewer fishermen use large boats In this case, there is no reduction in the overall catch due to overfishing. Let x be the number of fishermen using large boats, and (10-x) be the number of fishermen using small boats. Total catch = 1000 Catch per large boat = 1000/x Catch per small boat = 1000/(10-x) Profit per large boat = (1000/x)*price_per_fish - 200 Profit per small boat = (1000/(10-x))*price_per_fish - 100 Since each fisherman aims to maximize his individual profit, we need to find the value of x for which the profit per large boat is greater than or equal to the profit per small boat. (1000/x)*price_per_fish - 200 >= (1000/(10-x))*price_per_fish - 100 Simplifying the inequality, we get: 1000/x - 200 >= 1000/(10-x) - 100 Multiplying both sides by x(10-x), we get: 1000(10-x) - 200x(10-x) >= 1000x - 100x(10-x) 10000 - 1000x - 2000x + 200x^2 >= 1000x - 1000x^2 Rearranging the terms, we get: 3000x - 10000 >= 1200x^2 Dividing both sides by 100, we get: 30x - 100 >= 12x^2 Rearranging the terms, we get: 12x^2 - 30x + 100 <= 0 Now, we need to find the range of x for which this inequality holds true. We can use the quadratic formula to find the roots of the equation 12x^2 - 30x + 100 = 0: x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a x = (30 ± √(30^2 - 4*12*100)) / (2*12) x = (30 ± √(900 - 4800)) / 24 x = (30 ± √(-3900)) / 24 Since the discriminant is negative, there are no real roots for this equation. This means that there is no value of x for which the profit per large boat is greater than or equal to the profit per small boat when 5 or fewer fishermen use large boats. Case 2: More than 5 fishermen use large boats In this case, the overall catch is reduced by 50% due to overfishing. Let y be the number of fishermen using large boats, and (10-y) be the number of fishermen using small boats. Total catch = 500 Catch per large boat = 500/y Catch per small boat = 500/(10-y) Profit per large boat = (500/y)*price_per_fish - 200 Profit per small boat = (500/(10-y))*price_per_fish - 100 Since each fisherman aims to maximize his individual profit, we need to find the value of y for which the profit per large boat is greater than or equal to the profit per small boat. (500/y)*price_per_fish - 200 >= (500/(10-y))*price_per_fish - 100 Simplifying the inequality, we get: 500/y - 200 >= 500/(10-y) - 100 Multiplying both sides by y(10-y), we get: 500(10-y) - 200y(10-y) >= 500y - 100y(10-y) 5000 - 500y - 2000y + 200y^2 >= 500y - 1000y^2 Rearranging the terms, we get: 5000 - 500y - 2000y + 200y^2 >= 500y - 1000y^2 Rearranging the terms, we get: 1200y^2 - 3000y + 5000 <= 0 Now, we need to find the range of y for which this inequality holds true. We can use the quadratic formula to find the roots of the equation 1200y^2 - 3000y + 5000 = 0: y = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a y = (3000 ± √(3000^2 - 4*1200*5000)) / (2*1200) y = (3000 ± √(9000000 - 24000000)) / 2400 y = (3000 ± √(-15000000)) / 2400 Since the discriminant is negative, there are no real roots for this equation. This means that there is no value of y for which the profit per large boat is greater than or equal to the profit per small boat when more than 5 fishermen use large boats. Conclusion: Based on our analysis, there is no optimal number of fishermen that should use a large boat to maximize individual profit. In both cases, the profit per large boat is always less than the profit per small boat. Therefore, all fishermen should use small boats to maximize their individual profit. In this case, the profit of each fisherman will be: Profit per small boat = (500/10)*price_per_fish - 100 Profit per small boat = 50*price_per_fish - 100"},{"instruction":"Suppose there are 10 farmers who share a piece of land, and each farmer wants to graze their cows on the land as much as possible.

The two possible decisions for each farmer are to either add one more cow to their herd or not. We can represent this as a game with 10 players (the farmers) and two strategies for each player (add a cow or not). Let's consider the payoffs for each farmer. If a farmer adds a cow, they will benefit from the additional cow's production. However, if the total number of cows exceeds the plot's capacity (50 cows), the land will be overgrazed, and all farmers will suffer from reduced production due to the degradation of the land. We can represent the payoffs as follows: 1. If a farmer adds a cow and the total number of cows remains at or below 50, their payoff is positive (additional production). 2. If a farmer does not add a cow and the total number of cows remains at or below 50, their payoff is neutral (no change in production). 3. If a farmer adds a cow and the total number of cows exceeds 50, their payoff is negative (reduced production due to overgrazing). 4. If a farmer does not add a cow and the total number of cows exceeds 50, their payoff is also negative (reduced production due to overgrazing). In this game, each farmer's dominant strategy is to add a cow, as they will benefit from the additional production if the total number of cows remains at or below 50. However, if all farmers follow this strategy, the total number of cows will be 60, which exceeds the plot's capacity. This leads to overgrazing and reduced production for all farmers. This situation is an example of the \\"Tragedy of the Commons,\\" where individual rational decisions lead to a collectively suboptimal outcome. The optimal decision for the farmers as a group would be to maintain the current number of cows (50) to avoid overgrazing.

One possible solution to this problem is for the farmers to cooperate and agree not to add more cows to their herds.

We can create a payoff matrix to represent the possible outcomes: \`\`\` Farmer 2        | 0  | 1  | 2  | ... | 10 | ----------------------------------- Farmer | 0  |    |    |     |    |    1   |----|----|----|-----|----|        | 1  |    |    |     |    |        |----|----|----|-----|----|        | 2  |    |    |     |    |        |----|----|----|-----|----|        | .  |    |    |     |    |        | .  |    |    |     |    |        | .  |    |    |     |    |        |----|----|----|-----|----|        | 10 |    |    |     |    | \`\`\` We need to fill in the matrix with the payoffs for each farmer based on the number of cows grazed. If the total number of cows grazed is less than or equal to 18 (x + y ≤ 18), each farmer receives a payoff of 50 per cow. If the total number of cows grazed is more than 18 (x + y > 18), the field becomes overgrazed and the payoff per cow is reduced to 30. However, if both farmers work together and graze a total of 12 cows (x + y = 12), the field will remain healthy and each farmer will receive a payoff of 80 per cow. Now, let's find the Nash equilibrium by looking for the strategy pairs where neither farmer has an incentive to change their strategy, given the other farmer's strategy. If both farmers graze 6 cows each (x = 6, y = 6), the total number of cows is 12, and each farmer receives a payoff of 80 per cow. In this case, the total payoff for each farmer is 80 * 6 = 480. If either farmer decides to graze more cows, the total number of cows will exceed 12, and the payoff per cow will drop to 50 or even 30 if the total number of cows exceeds 18. In this case, the total payoff for each farmer will be less than 480. Therefore, the Nash equilibrium is when both farmers graze 6 cows each, and the corresponding payoffs are 480 for each farmer."},{"instruction":"A group of 10 farmers in a village share a common land of 100 acres for grazing their cattle.

What is the maximum number of cows that each farmer should graze on the common land to maximize their profit, while avoiding overgrazing?","output":"To avoid overgrazing, the total number of cattle on the common land should not exceed the carrying capacity of the land. Since each farmer can graze 10 cattle on the land, the total carrying capacity is 10 farmers * 10 cattle per farmer = 100 cattle. Now, let's calculate the profit for each farmer. The profit per cow is the revenue from milk and meat minus the cost of maintaining the cow, which is 200 - 50 = 150 per cow. To maximize their profit while avoiding overgrazing, each farmer should graze the maximum number of cattle allowed by the carrying capacity, which is 10 cattle per farmer.

There are 10 fishermen who have agreed to harvest the fish sustainably, which means they should only catch a maximum of 500 fish per year to allow the lake to replenish itself. However, each fisherman only considers his own catch and may decide to catch more than his share. The total annual revenue from catching 500 fish is 10,000, and it decreases by 50 for each additional fish caught due to resource depletion.  Assuming that each fisherman decides to maximize his individual revenue, how many fish will each fisherman catch? What will be the total revenue earned by all fishermen, and what will be the negative impact on the lake from overfishing?","output":"Let x be the number of fish caught by each fisherman. The total number of fish caught by all fishermen is 10x. The revenue per fisherman can be represented as R(x) = 1000 - 50x. To maximize their individual revenue, each fisherman will catch the number of fish where the revenue is at its highest. To find the maximum revenue, we can find the derivative of R(x) with respect to x: R'(x) = -50 Since the derivative is constant and negative, the revenue function is decreasing. Therefore, each fisherman will catch as few fish as possible while still maximizing their individual revenue. In this case, that means each fisherman will catch 50 fish, as this is the sustainable amount agreed upon. However, if each fisherman only considers their own catch and disregards the agreement, they would catch more fish to maximize their individual revenue. In this case, we need to consider the total revenue function for all fishermen: Total Revenue, TR(x) = 10 * (1000 - 50x) Now, we need to find the maximum of this function. Taking the derivative with respect to x: TR'(x) = -500 Since the derivative is constant and negative, the total revenue function is also decreasing. This means that the total revenue is maximized when the fishermen catch the least number of fish possible, which is the sustainable amount of 500 fish in total. However, if each fisherman only considers their own catch and disregards the agreement, they would catch more fish to maximize their individual revenue. In this case, the total number of fish caught would be greater than 500, leading to overfishing and a decrease in the total revenue earned by all fishermen. The negative impact on the lake from overfishing would be a decrease in the fish population, making it harder for the lake to replenish itself and potentially leading to the collapse of the fishery. This would have long-term consequences for both the fishermen and the ecosystem of the lake."},{"instruction":"Suppose there are 10 farmers who share a common grazing land.

Let's assume that each farmer gets a profit of P per cow grazed. If the total number of cows grazed exceeds 100, each farmer will suffer a loss of 500. Therefore, each farmer will try to avoid overgrazing the land. Let x be the number of cows grazed by each farmer. The total number of cows grazed by all farmers is 10x. To avoid overgrazing, we must have 10x ≤ 100, which implies x ≤ 10. Now, let's consider the profit of each farmer. If a farmer grazes x cows, their profit will be P * x. However, if the total number of cows grazed exceeds 100, the farmer will suffer a loss of 500. Therefore, the farmer's net profit will be P * x - 500 if 10x > 100. In a Nash equilibrium, no farmer has an incentive to change their strategy. If a farmer grazes more than 10 cows, they risk causing overgrazing and suffering a loss.

If too many cows graze on the field, the grass gets depleted, and the cows don't have enough to eat. The total cost of this depletion is distributed equally among all the farmers. Suppose, the marginal cost of adding a cow is given by MC(Q) = 2Q, where Q is the number of cows, and the total benefit that a farmer gets from grazing cows is given by B(q) = 30q - q^2, where q is the number of cows a farmer grazes.  What is the Nash equilibrium of this game? What is the maximum number of cows that can graze the field before the cost of depletion exceeds the benefit of adding another cow for each farmer?","output":"To find the Nash equilibrium, we need to find the number of cows each farmer will graze such that no farmer has an incentive to change their decision, given the decisions of the other farmers. Let q_i be the number of cows grazed by farmer i, and let Q = Σq_i be the total number of cows grazed by all farmers. The total cost of depletion is MC(Q) = 2Q, and since there are 10 farmers, the cost per farmer is (2Q)/10 = Q/5. The net benefit for each farmer is the difference between their individual benefit and their share of the total cost. For farmer i, this is given by: NB(q_i) = B(q_i) - Q/5 = (30q_i - q_i^2) - Q/5 To find the Nash equilibrium, we need to find the q_i that maximizes NB(q_i) for each farmer, given the decisions of the other farmers. To do this, we take the first derivative of NB(q_i) with respect to q_i and set it equal to zero: dNB(q_i)/dq_i = 30 - 2q_i - 1/5 * dQ/dq_i = 0 Since q_i is a part of Q, dQ/dq_i = 1. Thus, we have: 30 - 2q_i - 1/5 = 0 Solving for q_i, we get: q_i = (30 - 1/5) / 2 = 29/2 = 14.5 Since the number of cows must be an integer, each farmer will graze either 14 or 15 cows. However, if all farmers graze 15 cows, the total number of cows will be 150, and the marginal cost of adding another cow will be MC(150) = 300, which is greater than the marginal benefit of adding another cow, B'(15) = 30 - 2*15 = 0. Therefore, each farmer will graze 14 cows in the Nash equilibrium. The maximum number of cows that can graze the field before the cost of depletion exceeds the benefit of adding another cow for each farmer is when MC(Q) = B'(q). Setting these equal, we have: 2Q = 30 - 2q Since Q = 10q (10 farmers each with q cows), we can substitute and solve for q: 20q = 30 - 2q 22q = 30 q = 30/22 ≈ 1.36 Since the number of cows must be an integer, the maximum number of cows that can graze the field before the cost of depletion exceeds the benefit of adding another cow for each farmer is 1 cow per farmer, or 10 cows in total. However, this result does not match the Nash equilibrium we found earlier, as the Nash equilibrium assumes that all farmers act independently and do not cooperate to maximize their joint benefit. In the Nash equilibrium, each farmer will graze 14 cows, for a total of 140 cows, even though this results in a higher cost of depletion."},{"instruction":"Assuming there are 100 fishes in a lake shared by 10 fishermen and each fisherman has a quota of 10 fishes, what is the maximum number of fish that can be sustainably harvested by all the fishermen without depleting the fish population in the lake?","output":"To sustainably harvest fish without depleting the fish population, the fishermen need to ensure that the fish population can reproduce and maintain its current size.

The total number of cows that will graze on the land is 6 farmers * 3 cows per farmer = 18 cows. The cost of raising each cow is 5, and the market price per cow is 10.

Now, since all farmers are rational and profit-maximizing, they will all think in the same way. So, each farmer will add an extra cow to maximize their individual profit, despite the loss it causes to the others. As a result, each of the 10 farmers will have 6 cows, leading to a total of 60 cows on the common land. However, this exceeds the carrying capacity of the land, which is 50 cows. In this scenario, the total profit for each farmer would be 100 (from the extra cow) - 9 * 50 (losses caused to other farmers) = -350. This is not a rational outcome, as each farmer would be better off by not adding the extra cow and avoiding the losses.

Now, let's find the Nash Equilibrium by identifying the best response for each player: 1. If Fisherman 1 chooses strategy C, Fisherman 2's best response is strategy I, as 60 > 40. 2. If Fisherman 1 chooses strategy I, Fisherman 2's best response is strategy C, as 60 > 0. Similarly, 1. If Fisherman 2 chooses strategy C, Fisherman 1's best response is strategy I, as 60 > 40. 2. If Fisherman 2 chooses strategy I, Fisherman 1's best response is strategy C, as 60 > 0. There is no pure strategy Nash Equilibrium in this game, as no pair of strategies is a best response for both players simultaneously. However, there is a mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium. To find it, let's denote the probability that Fisherman 1 chooses strategy C as p, and the probability that Fisherman 2 chooses strategy C as q. Then, the expected payoffs for each player are: - Fisherman 1: 40pq + 10p(1-q) + 60(1-p)q - Fisherman 2: 40pq + 10q(1-p) + 60(1-q)p To find the Nash Equilibrium, we need to find the probabilities p and q that make both players indifferent between their strategies. This means that the expected payoffs for choosing C and I should be equal for both players: For Fisherman 1: 40pq + 10p(1-q) = 60(1-p)q 40pq + 10p - 10pq = 60q - 60pq For Fisherman 2: 40pq + 10q(1-p) = 60(1-q)p 40pq + 10q - 10pq = 60p - 60pq Solving these equations, we find that p = 3/4 and q = 3/4. So, the mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium is when both fishermen choose strategy C with a probability of 3/4 and strategy I with a probability of 1/4. Now, let's find the most efficient outcome for both fishermen in terms of total fish caught per day. The most efficient outcome would be when both fishermen improve their nets and share the lake's resources equally. In this case, they would each catch 50 fish per day, for a total of 100 fish per day. This outcome is not a Nash Equilibrium, as both fishermen have an incentive to deviate from this strategy.

This is a stable situation, as no farmer has an incentive to deviate from this strategy. - If a farmer believes that the other farmers will bring more than 50 animals in total, they should bring no animals and receive a benefit of 5 points. - If a farmer believes that the other farmers will bring less than 50 animals in total, they should bring as many animals as possible (up to 10) to maximize their profit. In conclusion, the optimal strategy for each farmer is to cooperate with the other farmers and bring 5 animals each, resulting in a total of 50 animals on the land and a profit of 10 points per farmer.

This means that the income from each cow will be reduced to 160 for all cows, not just the 11th cow. In this case, the total net income for each farmer would be 11 cows * 110 = 1210. Given this information, it is not rational for all farmers to graze 11 cows, as the total net income for each farmer would be lower than if they grazed only 10 cows.

This means that each fisherman values a future gain at 90% of its current value. Let's set up an equation for the total value of the catch for each fisherman: Value of catch = x * (1 - 0.1 * x) We want to maximize the value of the catch for each fisherman. To do this, we can take the derivative of the value of the catch with respect to x and set it equal to zero: d(Value of catch) / dx = 1 - 0.2 * x = 0 Solving for x, we get: x = 5 So, each fisherman should catch 5 fish to maximize their individual profits and prevent overfishing. The total catch for the village will be 10 * 5 = 50 fish, which is half of the total number of fish in the lake. This ensures that the fish population can recover and be sustainable for future fishing."},{"instruction":"Suppose that a group of ten farmers share a common field and each farmer receives a fixed share of the harvest, but is free to add more cattle to graze the common field. The benefit of adding one more cow is an additional 10 of profit, but the cost of adding one more cow is a reduction in the quality of the field's soil, which translates to a 5 cost to each farmer. How many cows will each farmer add to the common field if they act independently to maximize their profits?","output":"Let's analyze the situation for each farmer. When a farmer adds one cow, they gain 10 in profit. However, the cost of adding one more cow is a 5 reduction in the quality of the field's soil for each farmer, including themselves. So, the net gain for the farmer who adds the cow is 10 - 5 = 5.  Since there are 10 farmers, the total cost of adding one cow to the field is 10 * 5 = 50. The farmer who adds the cow only bears 5 of this cost, while the other 9 farmers bear the remaining 45 cost. This creates a situation where each farmer has an incentive to add more cows to the field to maximize their individual profit, even though it reduces the overall quality of the field and the collective profit. A farmer will continue to add cows as long as the net gain is positive. In this case, the net gain is always positive (5) for each cow added by the farmer. Therefore, each farmer will keep adding cows to the field to maximize their individual profit, leading to an overgrazing problem known as the \\"tragedy of the commons.\\" In conclusion, there is no specific number of cows that each farmer will add to the common field, as they will continue to add cows as long as the net gain is positive.

However, if the total effort level exceeds 50, the fish population becomes overexploited and each fisherman earns only 5 per fish caught. Find the Nash equilibrium of this game.","output":"To find the Nash equilibrium, we need to determine the best response of each fisherman to the strategies of the other fishermen, such that no fisherman has an incentive to change their strategy. Let e_i be the effort level of fisherman i, and let E be the total effort level of all fishermen. The payoff for fisherman i is given by: Payoff_i = (e_i / E) * (number of fish caught) * (price per fish) If E <= 50, the price per fish is 10, and if E > 50, the price per fish is 5. We will analyze these two cases separately. Case 1: E <= 50 In this case, the payoff for fisherman i is: Payoff_i = (e_i / E) * 100 * 10 = 1000 * (e_i / E) Each fisherman wants to maximize their payoff. If a fisherman increases their effort level, their payoff will increase as long as the total effort level remains below or equal to 50. Therefore, in equilibrium, each fisherman will choose an effort level of 10, resulting in a total effort level of 50. The Nash equilibrium in this case is (10, 10, 10, 10, 10). Case 2: E > 50 In this case, the payoff for fisherman i is: Payoff_i = (e_i / E) * 100 * 5 = 500 * (e_i / E) If a fisherman increases their effort level, their payoff will decrease due to overexploitation of the fish population. Therefore, no fisherman has an incentive to increase their effort level beyond 10. However, if a fisherman decreases their effort level, their payoff will increase as long as the total effort level remains above 50. This means that there is no stable Nash equilibrium in this case, as each fisherman has an incentive to decrease their effort level. In conclusion, the Nash equilibrium of this game is when each fisherman chooses an effort level of 10, resulting in a total effort level of 50 and a payoff of 200 for each fisherman.

Now, let's consider the case where one farmer cheats and grazes 5 cows while the other 9 farmers graze 3 cows each. In this case, the land will still not be overgrazed, but the cheating farmer will earn a personal profit.

In other words, we need to find a value for Z such that: 5,000 + Z ≤ 5,000 Subtracting 5,000 from both sides of the inequality, we get: Z ≤ 0 This means that the additional profit (Z) for grazing 5 cows must be less than or equal to 0. In this case, the payoff for grazing a maximum of 5 cows (Y) would be equal to the payoff for grazing a maximum of 3 cows (X), which is 5,000.

Since there are 10 farmers, they will divide the total capacity of 1500 cows equally among themselves. So, each farmer will graze 1500 cows / 10 farmers = 150 cows on the common land.

Each farmer can graze up to 5 cows on the pasture. If a farmer adds an additional cow, that cow will consume an additional 5 units of grass per day, which reduces the overall carrying capacity of the pasture. Each cow returns 100 in profit per week to its owner. However, if the total number of cows grazing on the pasture exceeds the carrying capacity, the grass will be depleted, which will lead to a reduction in the value of the cows. The value of the cows decreases by 50 per week for each cow in excess of the carrying capacity. Assuming that all the farmers behave rationally and try to maximize their profits, what is the equilibrium number of cows that will be grazing on the pasture?","output":"Let's first find the carrying capacity of the pasture. Since each farmer can graze up to 5 cows, and there are 10 farmers, the carrying capacity is 5 * 10 = 50 cows. Now, let's consider the profit for each farmer. If a farmer adds an additional cow, the profit from that cow is 100 per week. However, if the total number of cows exceeds the carrying capacity, the value of the cows decreases by 50 per week for each cow in excess. Let x be the number of cows in excess of the carrying capacity. The profit for each farmer will be: Profit = 100 * (5 + x) - 50 * x To find the equilibrium number of cows, we need to find the value of x that maximizes the profit for each farmer. Taking the derivative of the profit function with respect to x and setting it equal to 0, we get: d(Profit)/dx = 100 - 50 = 0 Since the derivative is constant and does not depend on x, the profit function is linear, and there is no maximum or minimum value. This means that the farmers will continue to add cows until the carrying capacity is reached, and the equilibrium number of cows will be equal to the carrying capacity. Therefore, the equilibrium number of cows that will be grazing on the pasture is 50."},{"instruction":"Let's assume that a certain fishery has 10 fishermen, and each fisherman can catch up to 100 fish per day.

This increased amount will be divided equally among the 10 players, so each player will receive an additional 2x/10 = x/5. However, the player who contributed x will have a net loss of x - x/5 = 4x/5. Since this is a negative value for any positive contribution, it is not in the player's best interest to contribute any amount to the public good. Therefore, the Nash equilibrium contribution for each player is 0. In this equilibrium, no player has an incentive to change their strategy, as any positive contribution would result in a net loss for the contributing player."},{"instruction":"a Public Goods Game scenario, there are four players, each with 10 points.

However, if all players contribute 2 points, the best strategy for each player becomes contributing either 1 or 2 points, as the payoffs are the same. In conclusion, the best strategy for each player is to contribute 2 points when the other players contribute 0 or 1 point each, and to contribute either 1 or 2 points when the other players contribute 2 points each. The maximum payoff each player can expect to receive is 5 points (when all players contribute 2 points)."},{"instruction":"Consider a Public Goods Game with four players who each have 20 to contribute to a public good.

Now, we want to find the optimal contribution x_i (or equivalently, the optimal total contribution X) that maximizes the payoff for each player. To do this, we can take the derivative of the payoff function with respect to X and set it equal to zero: frac{dP_i}{dX} = -0.5left(frac{1}{4}right) + 0.25 = 0. Solving for X, we get: X = 20.

If all individuals contribute (C = 100), each person's utility is: U_i = c_i - (1/4) * 100 In this case, any individual can improve their utility by not contributing (c_i = 0), as their utility would become: U_i = 0 - (1/4) * (100 - c_i) > c_i - (1/4) * 100 2. If no one contributes (C = 0), each person's utility is: U_i = 0 In this case, any individual can improve their utility by contributing a small amount (c_i > 0), as their utility would become: U_i = c_i - (1/4) * c_i = (3/4) * c_i > 0 3.

In this Nash equilibrium, no player has an incentive to unilaterally change their contribution, as doing so would either decrease their payoff or not affect it. However, this game has multiple Nash equilibria. One example is when all players contribute 0, resulting in a total contribution of 0, which is less than 30.

In conclusion, there are multiple Nash equilibria in this game, and the optimal individual contribution for each player depends on the strategies of the other players.

Let's denote the contribution of each player as x1, x2, x3, x4, and x5. The total contribution to the pot is the sum of these contributions: x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5. The pot is then multiplied by the factor of 1.5, so the total pot becomes 1.5(x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5). This amount is then divided equally among all 5 players, so each player receives 1.5(x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5) / 5. Now, let's consider the payoff for each player. The payoff for a player is the sum of their initial amount (10) minus their contribution (xi) plus their share of the pot. So, the payoff for each player can be represented as: Payoff_i = 10 - xi + (1.5(x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5) / 5) To maximize their individual payoffs, each player would want to minimize their contribution (xi) while still receiving a share of the pot. However, if all players contribute nothing, the pot will be empty, and no one will gain anything. Therefore, there must be a balance between contributing and not contributing. In this case, the optimal strategy for each player would be to contribute the minimum amount that still results in a positive payoff. Since the total contributions are multiplied by a factor of 1.5, each player should contribute an amount that, when multiplied by 1.5, is equal to or greater than the amount they would receive if they contributed nothing. Let's denote the minimum contribution as x_min. We want to find x_min such that: 1.5 * x_min >= (1.5 * 0) / 5 1.5 * x_min >= 0 x_min >= 0 Since the minimum contribution must be between 0 and 5, the optimal contribution for each player would be 0. However, this would result in an empty pot and no additional payoff for any player. Therefore, the optimal strategy in a Public Goods Game is for each player to contribute a small positive amount, just enough to create a positive payoff for all players. This amount will depend on the specific preferences and risk tolerance of each player, as well as their expectations about the contributions of other players."},{"instruction":"a Public Goods Game, there are 5 players who each contribute to a public fund.

The player who contributed 10 will have a net gain of 26 (36 - 10). 2. If a player contributes 20 and the other 4 players contribute 20 each, the total fund will be 100. After doubling, it becomes 200, and when divided among the 5 players, each player receives 40. The player who contributed 20 will have a net gain of 20 (40 - 20). 3.

After doubling, it becomes 120, and when divided among the 5 players, each player receives 24. The player who contributed 20 will have a net gain of 4 (24 - 20). From the above analysis, we can see that a player's best response is to contribute 10, regardless of the other players' contributions, as it results in a higher net gain in both cases. Therefore, the Nash equilibrium for this game is when all players contribute 10 each. In the Nash equilibrium, the total fund will be 50.

To maximize your payoff, we need to find the value of x that maximizes this expression. Taking the derivative with respect to x and setting it to zero: d(Payoff)/dx = -1 + (1.8/4) = 0 Solving for x, we get: x = 20/9 ≈ 2.22 Since you can only contribute whole tokens, you should contribute either 2 or 3 tokens to maximize your payoff.

The player who contributed x tokens will have 20 - x tokens left, plus the 0.15x tokens received from the fund, for a total of 20 - 0.85x tokens. Since 0.85x < x, this player will have fewer tokens than if they had contributed nothing. 4. Therefore, no player has an incentive to contribute any tokens to the public fund, given that all other players are contributing 0 tokens. This is the Nash equilibrium. In this equilibrium, the maximum payout for each player is their initial 20 tokens, as no tokens are contributed to the public fund and no additional tokens are distributed."},{"instruction":"a Public Goods Game with four players, each player must decide whether to contribute 5 or not contribute at all.

Let's analyze the possible outcomes: 1. If all four players contribute, each player receives 18.75. Their net gain is 18.75 - 5 = 13.75. 2. If three players contribute and one player does not, the contributing players receive 22.50 each. Their net gain is 22.50 - 5 = 17.50. The player who did not contribute receives 0, so their net gain is 0. 3. If two players contribute and two players do not, the contributing players receive frac{4*(2*5*1.5)}{4} = 15.00. Their net gain is 15.00 - 5 = 10.00. The players who did not contribute receive 0, so their net gain is 0. 4.

The players who did not contribute receive 0, so their net gain is 0. 5. If no players contribute, all players receive 0, so their net gain is 0. As we can see, the highest net gain for a player comes from not contributing and having the other three players contribute (17.50).

In each round, the total contribution is multiplied by 2 and then divided equally among the 5 participants. This means that for each dollar contributed to the pool, the contributor gets back 2/5 of a dollar, and the other participants get 2/5 of a dollar each as well. To maximize the total payoff for each participant, they should aim to maximize the return on their investment in each round. Since the return on investment is 2/5 for each dollar contributed, the optimal strategy would be to contribute as much as possible in each round, i.e., the entire endowment of 100. Let's calculate the total payoff for each participant if they follow this strategy: 1. In the first round, each participant contributes 100, making the total contribution 500. This amount is multiplied by 2, resulting in 1000, which is then divided equally among the 5 participants, giving each participant 200. 2. In the second round, each participant contributes their entire endowment again (200), making the total contribution 1000. This amount is multiplied by 2, resulting in 2000, which is then divided equally among the 5 participants, giving each participant 400. 3. This process continues for 10 rounds.

If there are less than 6 contributors, the best strategy for a student is to shirk, as the bonus will not be awarded, and they can avoid the work without affecting their own score. The Nash equilibrium occurs when no student has an incentive to change their strategy, given the strategies of the other students. In this case, the Nash equilibrium is when all 10 students contribute to the project. If any student deviates from this strategy and decides to shirk, they will receive a lower score (10 points) compared to contributing (20 points).

Now, let's calculate the expected value of the game for player A. There are four possible outcomes: 1. Player A shows heads, and player B shows heads: Probability = 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36, and player A wins 1. 2. Player A shows heads, and player B shows tails: Probability = 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24, and player A loses 1. 3. Player A shows tails, and player B shows heads: Probability = 0.4 * 0.6 = 0.24, and player A loses 1. 4. Player A shows tails, and player B shows tails: Probability = 0.4 * 0.4 = 0.16, and player A wins 1. The expected value of the game for player A is the sum of the products of the probabilities and the corresponding payoffs: Expected Value = (0.36 * 1) + (0.24 * -1) + (0.24 * -1) + (0.16 * 1) = 0.36 - 0.24 - 0.24 + 0.16 = 0.04.

We will use the binomial probability formula to calculate the probability of each outcome and then sum them up. The binomial probability formula is: P(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x) where P(x) is the probability of x successes in n trials, C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time, p is the probability of success, and (1-p) is the probability of failure. In this game, the probability of player 1 winning a round is 1/2 (since there are two possible outcomes: head or tail), and the probability of player 2 winning a round is also 1/2. So, p = 1/2 and (1-p) = 1/2. Now, let's calculate the probabilities for player 1 winning 3, 4, or 5 rounds: 1. Player 1 wins 3 rounds (and player 2 wins 2 rounds): P(3) = C(5, 3) * (1/2)^3 * (1/2)^2 = 10 * (1/8) * (1/4) = 10/32 2. Player 1 wins 4 rounds (and player 2 wins 1 round): P(4) = C(5, 4) * (1/2)^4 * (1/2)^1 = 5 * (1/16) * (1/2) = 5/32 3. Player 1 wins 5 rounds (and player 2 wins 0 rounds): P(5) = C(5, 5) * (1/2)^5 * (1/2)^0 = 1 * (1/32) * 1 = 1/32 Now, we sum up these probabilities: P(player 1 wins at least 3 rounds and player 2 wins no more than 2 rounds) = P(3) + P(4) + P(5) = 10/32 + 5/32 + 1/32 = 16/32 = 1/2 So, the probability that player 1 wins at least 3 rounds and player 2 wins no more than 2 rounds is 1/2 or 50%."},{"instruction":"Suppose two players play the matching pennies game three times.

The probability of both coins landing on heads is 0.6 * 0.5 = 0.3. In this case, P1 wins 1 point. 2.

The expected winnings for Player B can be calculated as follows: E(B) = P(B wins) - P(A wins) E(B) = (0.6 * 0.4) + (0.4 * 0.6) - (0.6 * 0.6) - (0.4 * 0.4) E(B) = 0.24 + 0.24 - 0.36 - 0.16 E(B) = 0.48 - 0.52 E(B) = -0.04 So, by choosing tails with a probability of 0.6 and heads with a probability of 0.4, Player B can minimize their expected losses to -0.04 per game.

Player A chooses heads, and player B chooses tails (probability: p * (1-q)) 4. Player A chooses tails, and player B chooses heads (probability: (1-p) * q) Player A wins in outcomes 1 and 2, and loses in outcomes 3 and 4.

Since the game is symmetric, the optimal strategy for both players is to choose heads and tails with equal probability.

The profit function for firm 1 is given by: π1 = P * q1 - C(q1) π1 = (a - b(q1 + q2)) * q1 - k * q1 Similarly, the profit function for firm 2 is given by: π2 = P * q2 - C(q2) π2 = (a - b(q1 + q2)) * q2 - k * q2 To find the reaction functions, we need to find the first-order conditions (FOC) for profit maximization for each firm.

From the first equation, we can express q_B in terms of q_A: q_B = 70 - 2q_A Substitute this expression for q_B into the second equation: 2q_B + q_A = 70 2(70 - 2q_A) + q_A = 70 140 - 4q_A + q_A = 70 3q_A = 70 - 140 3q_A = -70 q_A = -70/3 ≈ -23.33 Since the output level cannot be negative, there must be an error in the calculations.

Then, the total quantity produced in the market is Q = Q1 + Q2 + Q3.

Since there are two other competitors with the same cost function, we can assume that they will also produce the same quantity of widgets as the company to maximize their profits. Let the quantity produced by each firm be q, then the total quantity produced in the market, Q, is 3q. The market demand curve is given by Q = 200 - P. We can rewrite this equation to find the price as a function of the total quantity produced: P = 200 - Q. Since Q = 3q, we can substitute this into the price equation: P = 200 - 3q. The company's revenue (R) is the product of the price and the quantity it produces: R = P * q = (200 - 3q) * q. The company's cost function is C(Q) = 2Q. Since Q = 3q, the cost function for the company can be written as C(q) = 2 * 3q = 6q. The company's profit (π) is the difference between its revenue and its cost: π = R - C = (200 - 3q) * q - 6q. To maximize its profit, the company needs to find the value of q that maximizes this profit function. To do this, we can take the first derivative of the profit function with respect to q and set it equal to 0: dπ/dq = (200 - 3q) * 1 + q * (-3) - 6 = 0. Simplifying the equation: 200 - 6q - 6 = 0.

Now, we can find the monopoly price using the market demand curve: P(Q) = 100 - 0.5Q = 100 - 0.5(90) = 55 The monopoly price is 55. To find the monopoly profits, we can use the profit function: π = (100 - 0.5(90))(90) - 10(90) = 55(90) - 10(90) = 4050 The monopoly profits are 4,050. Comparing the monopoly values to the Cournot competition values, we see that the monopoly produces a higher output (90 vs. 60), charges a lower price (55 vs. 70), and earns higher profits (4,050 vs. 1,800 for each company)."}]`),z={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:N},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:k,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},E={key:0,class:"empty-state"},D=["disabled"],_={key:0},F={key:1};function W(i,e,h,y,s,r){const u=m("PoemCard");return o(),a("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",C,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=n=>s.searchQuery=n),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[g,s.searchQuery]]),s.searchQuery?(o(),a("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=n=>s.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(o(!0),a(w,null,v(r.displayedPoems,(n,d)=>(o(),q(u,{key:d,poem:n},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(o(),a("div",E,' No results found for "'+c(s.searchQuery)+'".
