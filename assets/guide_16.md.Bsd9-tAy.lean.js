In the rest of the world, China's supreme sage, Kongfuzi (K'ung Fu-tzu), is better known by the romanized name \\"Confucius.\\" He was born in 551 b.c. in what is now Shandong Province in eastern China. So profound was his influence that eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to the birthplace of the Great Teacher. You, too, can pay your respects at the vast temple raised on the site of his home in the small town of Qufu (Chufu), and at his tomb in the woods just to the north. The classics of Confucius, while seldom addressing spiritual and metaphysical matters, set standards for social and political conduct that still underlie many of the Chinese ways of doing and perceiving. Confucius laid great stress on the proper and harmonious relationships between ruler and subject, parent and child, teacher and student, the individual and the state. These relationships were deemed to be hierarchical and dictatorial. If the order was disturbed, dire consequences inevitably resulted. The son who disobeyed the father would bring disaster upon himself and his family, just as the emperor who defied the \\"mandate of heaven\\" or ignored the good of the empire brought ruin upon the nation. Over the centuries Confucius has suffered more changes of fortune than probably any other philosopher. Honored soon after his death as the greatest of scholars, he was later revered as semi-divine; you can still visit temples to Confucius in many Chinese cities. During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), however, he was denounced as a counter-revolutionary force. It was only after the death of Chairman Mao (1976) and the opening of China to the outside world under more progressive reformers that Confucius, too, was \\"rehabilitated.\\" Unlike Confucius, about whose life many specific and even colorful details are known, the philosopher Laozi (Lao Tse or Lao-Tzu) is an enigma. Estimates of his date of birth vary by well over a century. One legend even says he taught the young Confucius. Laozi is immortalized by his book of thoughts on man, nature, and the universe, Daodejing (\\"The Way and Its Power\\"), which became the major text of China's greatest indigenous religion, Daoism (Taoism). With its emphasis on nature, intuition, the individual, paradox (\\"The knowledge which is not knowledge\\"), and the cosmic flow known as \\"The Way,\\" Daoism became the religion of artists and philosophers. After the death of Confucius, the Zhou Dynasty entered a period of strife known as the \\"Warring States\\" period (475–221 b.c.).

Hollywood is a neighborhood in the central region of Los Angeles, California. This ethnically diverse, densely populated neighborhood is notable as the home of the U.S. film industry, including several of its historic studios, and its name has come to be a shorthand reference for the industry and the people in it.  Hollywood was a small community in 1870 and was incorporated as a municipality in 1903. It was consolidated with the city of Los Angeles in 1910, and soon thereafter a prominent film industry emerged, eventually becoming the most recognizable film industry in the world.  In 1853, one adobe hut stood in Nopalera (Nopal field), named for the Mexican Nopal cactus indigenous to the area. By 1870, an agricultural community flourished. The area was known as the Cahuenga Valley, after the pass in the Santa Monica Mountains immediately to the north.  According to the diary of H. J. Whitley, known as the \\"Father of Hollywood,\\" on his honeymoon in 1886 he stood at the top of the hill looking out over the valley. Along came a Chinese man in a wagon carrying wood. The man got out of the wagon and bowed. The Chinese man was asked what he was doing and replied, \\"I holly-wood,\\" meaning 'hauling wood.' H. J. Whitley had an epiphany and decided to name his new town Hollywood. \\"Holly\\" would represent England and \\"wood\\" would represent his Scottish heritage.

OPTIONS: a. stay up all night and then complete your task.; b. set an alarm on your cell phone.;","output":"To accomplish the goal of waking up at the proper time, I would recommend option B: setting an alarm on your cell phone. However, there are many strategies that could help improve the effectiveness of this approach and ensure that you wake up at the right time feeling rested and recharged for the day ahead. Here's a detailed plan for successfully waking up at the proper time using your cell phone alarm: 1. Establish a consistent sleep schedule: Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day helps regulate your body's internal clock, making it easier to wake up at the desired time. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night, and try to maintain your sleep schedule even on weekends. 2. Create a bedtime routine: Establish a calming pre-sleep routine to help signal your body to wind down and prepare for sleep. This could include activities like reading a book, listening to soothing music, or practicing relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or meditation. 3. Minimize bright lights and electronic devices before bed: Exposure to bright lights and screens from devices like smartphones, tablets, and computers can interfere with your body's production of melatonin—a hormone that helps regulate sleep—making it harder to fall asleep and wake up in the morning. Aim to stop using these devices one hour before bedtime, or use blue light filters if possible.   4. Optimize your sleeping environment: Ensure your bedroom is conducive to sleep by keeping it cool, dark, and quiet. Invest in blackout curtains if necessary, use a white noise machine to mask external sounds, and consider using a fan or air conditioner to maintain a comfortable temperature. 5. Set an alarm on your cell phone: Choose a sound that is pleasant yet effective in waking you up. Ensure the volume is at an appropriate level so that you can hear it but aren't jolted awake. You can also consider using an app that gently wakes you up over a period of time or during a lighter phase of sleep for a more natural waking experience. 6. Limit the snooze button: Hitting the snooze button and going back to sleep can make it harder to wake up fully and lead to grogginess throughout the day. Aim to get up as soon as your alarm goes off, and consider moving your phone or alarm clock to the other side of the room to encourage you to get out of bed and turn it off. 7. Practice good sleep hygiene: Avoid caffeine and large meals in the evening, limit daytime naps, and engage in regular physical activity to help improve the quality of your sleep and make it easier to wake up at the right time. 8. Seek help if needed: If you struggle consistently with waking up at the proper time despite implementing these strategies, it may be time to consult with a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying sleep disorders or other medical concerns. By implementing these strategies in addition to setting an alarm on your cell phone, you significantly increase the likelihood of consistently waking up at the proper time feeling rested and ready to take on the day."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

How is \\"\\"Then I will help you, child.\\" said in Czech?","output":"In Czech, the phrase \\"Then I will help you, child.\\" can be translated as \\"Pak ti pomůžu, dítě.\\" Here's some context to help you better understand how these words correlate. First, let's break down the sentence into its individual parts: 1. \\"Then\\" – In Czech, this is usually translated as \\"pak\\" or \\"potom.\\" Both of these words can be used interchangeably. In this case, we'll use \\"pak\\" for the translation. 2. \\"I\\" – The first person singular pronoun is \\"já\\" in Czech; however, when conjugating the verb, it's not always necessary to use the pronoun explicitly, as the verb form itself indicates the subject. For simplicity and a natural flow in speech, Czech speakers often drop the pronoun in such cases. 3. \\"will help\\" – \\"to help\\" is the English verb, which in Czech is \\"pomoci\\" or \\"pomáhat.\\" To indicate future tense in Czech, you can use a future tense of auxiliary verb \\"být\\" (to be) with the infinitive form of the main verb, or you can simply use the future form of the verb itself. In this case, we'll use the future form of \\"pomoci,\\" which is \\"pomůžu.\\" 4. \\"you\\" – This pronoun translates to \\"ty\\" (informal) or \\"vy\\" (formal) in Czech. Since the phrase mentions a child, we'll use the informal version, which is \\"ti\\" in the dative form, because the verb \\"pomoci\\" is usually followed by a dative pronoun or object. 5. \\"child\\" – In Czech, this translates to \\"dítě,\\" which is a gender-neutral term to describe a young child. Now let's combine the words to create the Czech translation: \\"Pak ti pomůžu, dítě.\\" Keep in mind that word order can be quite flexible in Czech sentences, so you might come across different variations of this sentence: \\"Pomůžu ti pak, dítě.\\" or \\"Dítě, pak ti pomůžu.\\" However, all these variations effectively communicate the same meaning as the original English phrase \\"Then I will help you, child.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Trinity counters that \\"Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) says he may be 'the One',\\" just as the sound of a number being selected alerts Trinity that someone may be tracing their call.

When there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can easily reproduce, so the birth rate is high. As the population increases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease. When necessary resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will die. Overall, the population cannot reproduce at the same rate, so the birth rates drop. This will cause the population growth rate to decrease.  I am facing a new situation today: A team of biologists has been monitoring the deer population in the state of Wisconsin. They use past data and current conditions to predict how the population will grow or shrink and recommend how many hunting licenses the state should issue during hunting season to keep the population stable.

In an attempt to appease affected customers and repair its image, the German automaker is reportedly launching a \\"TDI Goodwill Program\\" set to roll out on Monday. Step 1: Explain the TDI Goodwill Program: According to a report on The Truth About Cars, Volkswagen will offer owners of affected diesel cars up to 1,250 in cash under the TDI Goodwill Program. This new initiative aims to compensate customers who have been impacted by the scandal and to rebuild trust in the Volkswagen brand. Step 2: Break down the compensation package: The compensation reportedly comes in the form of a 500 prepaid gift card, which can be spent anywhere, and an additional 500 to 700 to be spent at participating Volkswagen dealerships. By offering these incentives, Volkswagen hopes to make amends to its customers and encourage them to continue using its products and services. Step 3: Mention the limited information available and the official announcement: Volkswagen has yet to release official details about the program but confirmed that an announcement is coming on Monday, according to the New York Times. A head of a dealership association, not briefed on specifics, stated that \\"there is a program in the works with VW, that I do understand.\\" Step 4: Address the potential complications with existing class-action lawsuits: One significant aspect that remains unclear is whether owners of affected cars who are involved in class-action lawsuits against Volkswagen would have to abandon those claims to participate in the TDI Goodwill Program. This could potentially influence the decision of many owners to partake in the program.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the King that a mounted white horse representing him is carved into the chalk hills of Osmington? from the following article ?  Weymouth originated as a settlement on a constricted site to the south and west of Weymouth Harbour, an outlying part of Wyke Regis. The town developed from the mid 12th century onwards, but was not noted until the 13th century. By 1252 it was established as a seaport and became a chartered borough. Melcombe Regis developed separately on the peninsula to the north of the harbour; it was mentioned as a licensed wool port in 1310. French raiders found the port so accessible that in 1433 the staple was transferred to Poole. Melcombe Regis is thought to be the first port at which the Black Death came into England in June 1348, possibly either aboard a spice ship or an army ship. In their early history Weymouth and Melcombe Regis were rivals for trade and industry, but the towns were united in an Act of Parliament in 1571 to form a double borough. Both towns have become known as Weymouth, despite Melcombe Regis being the main centre. The villages of Upwey, Broadwey, Preston, Wyke Regis, Chickerell, Southill, Radipole and Littlemoor have become part of the built-up area. King Henry VIII had two Device Forts built to protect the south Dorset coast from invasion in the 1530s: Sandsfoot Castle in Wyke Regis and Portland Castle in Castletown. Parts of Sandsfoot have fallen into the sea due to coastal erosion. During the English Civil War, around 250 people were killed in the local Crabchurch Conspiracy in February 1645.  In 1635, on board the ship Charity, around 100 emigrants from the town crossed the Atlantic Ocean and settled in Weymouth, Massachusetts. More townspeople emigrated to the Americas to bolster the population of Weymouth, Nova Scotia and Salem, Massachusetts; then called Naumking. There are memorials to this on the side of Weymouth Harbour and near to Weymouth Pavilion and Weymouth Sea Life Tower.

Article: The Maldives faces the threat of extinction from rising sea levels, but the government said on Thursday it was looking to the future with plans to build homes and a golf course that float. An increase in sea levels of just 18 to 59 centimeters would make the Maldives -- a nation of tiny coral islands in the Indian Ocean -- virtually uninhabitable by 2100, the UN's climate change panel has warned. President Mohamed Nasheed has vowed a fight for survival, and last month he signed a deal with a Dutch company to study proposals for a floating structure that could support a convention centre, homes and an 18-hole golf course. \\"It is still early stages and we are awaiting a report on the possibility,\\" a government official said. The company, Dutch Docklands, is currently building floating developments in the Netherlands and Dubai. There was no immediate comment from the firm but its website said it undertook projects that make \\"land from water by providing large-scale floating constructions to create similar conditions as on land\\". The Maldives began work on an artificial island known as the Hulhumale near the crowded capital island of Male in 1997 and more than 30,000 people have been settled there to ease _ . The city, which has a population of 100,000, is already protected from rising sea levels by a 30-million-dollar sea wall, and the government is considering increasingly imaginative ways to combat climate change. Nasheed, who staged the world's first underwater cabinet meeting in October to highlight his people's dilemma , has even spoken of buying land elsewhere in the world to enable Maldivians to relocate if their homes are flooded. He has also pledged the Hulhumale to turn his nation into a model for the rest of the world by becoming \\"carbon neutral\\" by 2020. His plan involves ending fossil fuel use and powering all vehicles and buildings from \\"green\\" sources. Question: Which of the following is NOT Nasheed's idea?  _ Options: A: To purchase land elsewhere in the world to help Maldivians to relocate if their homes are flooded.

QUEBEC CITY, CANADA — On the eve of the G-7 summit in Canada, the U.S. president lashed out at host Justin Trudeau and the White House announced Donald Trump would skip some of the sessions. In two tweets Thursday evening, Trump accused the Canadian prime minister, as well as French President Emmanuel Macron, of “charging the U.S. massive tariffs” and creating “non-monetary barriers.” Trump also said Trudeau was being “indignant” about the cross-border trade relationship. Later Thursday night, Trump took to Twitter again to urge the European Union and Canada to “Take down your tariffs & barriers or we will more than match you!” Trump’s tweets came after Macron threatened to exclude the United States from the G-7 final statement to be issued in the mountainous tourism destination of Charlevoix. In his own tweets in French and English, Macron stated that while Trump “may not mind being isolated” the other six leaders meeting in Canada would also not mind signing an agreement among themselves. “American jobs are on the line because of his actions and because of his administration,” Trudeau said at a joint news conference with Macron earlier in the day in Ottawa. “When we can underscore this, and we see that there’s a lot of pressure within the U.S., perhaps he will revise his position.” “A trade war doesn’t spare anyone,” Macron said. “It will start to hurt American workers. The cost of raw materials will rise and industry will become less competitive.” After the contentious salvos on social media and the Trudeau-Macron news conference, the White House announced Trump would depart the summit at 10:30 a.m. Saturday, following the session on women’s empowerment. \\"The president will travel directly to Singapore from Canada in anticipation of his upcoming meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un Tuesday.

Context: Chopin took the new salon genre of the nocturne, invented by the Irish composer John Field, to a deeper level of sophistication. He was the first to write ballades and scherzi as individual concert pieces. He essentially established a new genre with his own set of free-standing preludes (Op. 28, published 1839). He exploited the poetic potential of the concept of the concert étude, already being developed in the 1820s and 1830s by Liszt, Clementi and Moscheles, in his two sets of studies (Op. 10 published in 1833, Op. 25 in 1837).

Based on the sentence \\"A group of women are eating on a terrace.\\", is the sentence \\"The women are having food outside.\\" a true sentence?","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"The women are having food outside.\\" can be considered a true sentence based on the information provided in the original sentence, \\"A group of women are eating on a terrace.\\"  To break down why this conclusion is reached, we can analyze the key components of both sentences and determine how their meanings are connected: 1. Subject: In both sentences, the subject is \\"women\\" or \\"a group of women.\\" This consistency in the subject is the first indication that the two sentences are related and may convey similar information. 2. Verb: The action of \\"eating\\" in the original sentence is paralleled by \\"having food\\" in the modified sentence. Although different words are used, they both describe the same activity, which is consuming food. This further strengthens the connection between the two sentences. 3. Location: In the original sentence, the women are described as eating \\"on a terrace.\\" A terrace is typically an outdoor area adjacent to a building or residence, usually elevated and may have seating arrangements. In the modified sentence, the location is described simply as \\"outside.\\" Although the latter description may be less specific than the former, it still accurately depicts the location to be an outdoor setting. By drawing these connections in the content of both sentences, it can be determined that the information provided in the modified sentence corresponds to the key elements of the original sentence. Hence, \\"The women are having food outside.\\" is a true sentence when considered in the context of \\"A group of women are eating on a terrace.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer a question about this article: After Richard's death on 6 April 1199 there were two potential claimants to the Angevin throne: John, whose claim rested on being the sole surviving son of Henry II, and young Arthur I of Brittany, who held a claim as the son of John's elder brother Geoffrey. Richard appears to have started to recognise John as his heir presumptive in the final years before his death, but the matter was not clear-cut and medieval law gave little guidance as to how the competing claims should be decided. With Norman law favouring John as the only surviving son of Henry II and Angevin law favouring Arthur as the only son of Henry's elder son, the matter rapidly became an open conflict. John was supported by the bulk of the English and Norman nobility and was crowned at Westminster, backed by his mother, Eleanor. Arthur was supported by the majority of the Breton, Maine and Anjou nobles and received the support of Philip II, who remained committed to breaking up the Angevin territories on the continent. With Arthur's army pressing up the Loire valley towards Angers and Philip's forces moving down the valley towards Tours, John's continental empire was in danger of being cut in two. Who was the sole surviving son?","output":"The sole surviving son was John, who later became King John of England.

Plot title: Antichrist Movie plot: Prologue[edit] A couple makes passionate love, as their toddler, Nic, climbs up to the bedroom window and falls to his death. Chapter One: Grief[edit] The mother collapses at the funeral, and spends the next month in the hospital crippled with atypical grief. The father, a therapist, is skeptical of the psychiatric care she is receiving and takes it upon himself to treat her personally with psychotherapy. But it is not successful, and so when she reveals that her second greatest fear is nature, he decides to try exposure therapy. They hike to their isolated cabin in a woods called Eden, where she spent time with Nic the previous summer while writing a thesis on gynocide. He encounters a doe which shows no fear of him, and has a stillborn fawn hanging halfway out of her. Chapter Two: Pain (Chaos Reigns)[edit] During sessions of psychotherapy, she becomes increasingly grief stricken and manic, often demanding forceful sex to escape the pain. The area becomes increasingly sinister to the man, including acorns rapidly pelting the metal roof, awakening with a hand covered in swollen ticks, and finding a self-disemboweling fox that tells him, \\"chaos reigns.\\" Chapter Three: Despair (Gynocide)[edit] In the dark attic the man finds the womanâs thesis studies: terrifying pictures of witch-hunts, and a scrapbook in which her writing becomes increasingly frantic and illegible. She reveals that while writing her thesis, she came to believe that all women are inherently evil. The man is repulsed by this and reproaches her for buying into the gynocidal beliefs she had originally set out to criticize. In a frenzied moment, they have violent intercourse at the base of an ominous dead tree, where bodies are intertwined within the exposed roots. He suspects that Satan is her greatest, and hidden fear. Through the autopsy and old photos, he becomes aware that she had been systematically putting Nicâs shoes on the wrong feet, resulting in pain and deformity.

Try to arrange sofas and chairs in a square around a circular table. Avoid an L-shaped arrangement as this leaves a missing corner. The centre of the living room should be left clear. Make sure there is a lot of light, which will promote good energy. Put plants in the corners of the room, as they attract good energy and will energize your health, but not ones with sharp leaves such as yuccas or cactus. Fresh flowers also bring good energy, but throw them away as soon as they begin to die, and don't have dried flowers. Mirrors are vital because they reflect energy. Round or oval ones are best, but they should not be opposite each other, nor should they reflect a door, otherwise your good fortune will go out of it. To promote harmony between the members of your family, have photos of them around the room, preferably smiling. If you want to find a partner, energize the south-west corner of your living room or bedroom by placing a floor light at least 1.75m high there, and turn it on every evening. Surround yourself with decorations and objects in pairs, such as ducks or birds. To avoid blocking the positive energy in the room, keep everything tidy. Don't accumulate too many unnecessary things.

Step 3: Visit the website where the image was found or the copyright holder's website to check for copyright information related to the image. Step 4: Perform a reverse image search, such as through Google Images or TinEye, to see if the image appears in other places with copyright information. Step 5: Consult an intellectual property attorney or conduct further legal research to determine the copyright status of the image if steps 1-4 have not yielded definitive information. Second question: How can I check if a certain image on the net is copyrighted? Step 1: Perform a reverse image search of the image in question using a search engine like Google Images or TinEye. Step 2: Review the search results to see if the image appears with copyright information like copyright symbols, notices, or watermarks, or if it's displayed on the creator's official website. Step 3: Check the metadata of the image, which might hold information about the creator and licensing. Step 4: If unable to determine the copyright status through these steps, consult an intellectual property attorney or conduct further legal research. Now, to answer your last question, both questions largely ask the same thing. They are both seeking methods to determine the copyright status of an image. The process for checking an image's copyright status is essentially the same in both questions but with slight variations in steps and language."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: It's been over 10 years since Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie first appeared in Mr. and Mrs. Smith together, and now they're returning to the big screen for a more somber movie.      By the Sea is scheduled to hit theaters November 13, 2015, and from the looks of this new still of Jolie and Pitt, the film will be an emotional roller coaster.      PHOTOS: Brangelina's Most Matching Moments      Set in France during the mid-1970s, the romantic drama follows former dancer Vanessa (Jolie) and her husband Roland (Pitt), an American writer, as they travel the countryside together. The couple seem to be growing apart, but when they linger in a quiet seaside town, they begin to draw close to some of its more vibrant inhabitants.      \\"This is a story about a relationship derailed by loss, the tenacity of love and the path to recovery and acceptance,\\" Jolie and Pitt said in a joint statement. \\"It has been a privilege to explore these universal human experiences with such a generous and talented cast and crew.\\"      Back in August, the married co-stars reportedly cut their honeymoon short to start production on the flick. The couple, along with their six children, traveled to the Mediterranean island of Gozo, near Malta, to shoot scenes for the film. Jolie was the director.      NEWS: Angelina Jolie Says Marriage to Brad Pitt 'Can Be Hard Work'      By The Sea will be the first time the pair has appeared on screen since Mr. and Mrs. Smith in 2005, the initial set where they fell in love.            This Brangelina news reminds us of Jolie's amazing speech at this year's Kids' Choice Awards. Check it out: ||||| Summer 2015      Angelina Jolie Pitt: 'I'm Much Happier Directing'      Actor, activist, and international celebrity, Angelina Jolie Pitt was surprised by how much she’s loved being behind the camera for three serious-minded films—and counting. She just rolls up her sleeves and gets the job done.      BY MARGY ROCHLIN            (Photo: Ken Regan/GK Films/The Kobal Collection)      A child of Hollywood, Angelina Jolie Pitt has been on too many sets to count—she made her acting debut at age 7 in a bit part opposite her father, Jon Voight, in Hal Ashby's Lookin' to Get Out. But the thought of directing a movie didn't occur to her until 2010. That was when she wrote the screenplay for In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), a bleak '90s-era love story set against the backdrop of the Bosnian War. Her decision to direct it, she says, was motivated by fear and propriety over the script's brutal and complicated subject matter. \\"The idea that somebody would take it and interpret it—and possibly interpret it the wrong way—scared me,\\" says Jolie Pitt. \\"So by default, I chose to direct it myself.\\"      Since then Jolie Pitt has directed the biographical World War II war movie, Unbroken (2014), and By the Sea, a marital drama starring herself and her husband, Brad Pitt, that will be released in the fall. If her three films vary stylistically, what they all share is a seriousness in tone and subject matter. \\"It's probably not an accident that the films that I care about happen to be about issues that matter to me, stories that I want to tell,\\" says Jolie Pitt. \\"If you're going to spend two years of your life on something it has to matter to you, you have to be passionate about it.\\"      But before making her directorial debut the most practical experience she'd had on the other side of the camera was helping organize documentary footage culled from her many humanitarian aid missions. So prior to her first film, she embarked on a newbie's listening tour of Hollywood, seeking out top talent in their field—music supervisors, DPs, whoever would talk to her. To each she asked the same question, \\"What are common mistakes made by first-time directors?\\" It was from French editor, Patricia Rommel, who has edited two of Jolie Pitt's films, that she learned to wait an extra beat before calling \\"Cut!\\" and to shoot as much incidental footage as possible. \\"She said, ‘Get extra shots of your locations, get extra shots of everything,'\\" says Jolie Pitt. \\"‘You just don't know when you get in the editing room what you will need as a link or a tool for a transition. If you're in a room and there's a kettle boiling, get a shot of it. Don't worry if people think you're nuts.'\\"      Rommel also instructed her to think of the movie as a whole, not scene by scene. \\"She said, ‘Remember that each scene is not individual. It's the way that scenes connect. Whether they will connect from a very wide shot to a very tight close-up, there should be a real thought behind it. And to try to understand when you finish a scene or begin a scene to remember where you were and where you're going in your film. From cut to cut, have that in your head. Don't shoot them as individual pieces.'\\"      Jolie Pitt got the assignment to direct Unbroken \\"like any movie,\\" she recalls. \\"It took many meetings, many phone calls, hours of work on storyboards and on the budget to show it was possible to make the film—all the things a director has to do to prove that a film needs to be made and that they are the person to make it.\\"      What attracted her to Unbroken, which was based on Laura Hillenbrand's book about Olympic runner and American war hero, Louis Zamperini, was how it explored themes of brotherhood, the triumph of the human spirit and the importance of forgiveness. While Unbroken moves chronologically as Zamperini goes from combat bombardier to Japanese POW, there are also flashbacks to his Torrance, California, boyhood. It was Jolie Pitt's idea to use one of her favorite movies—Sidney Lumet's military prison film, The Hill (1965)—to give it a bright, clean almost old-fashioned look.            Commanding Presence: Jolie Pitt favored strong compositions over flashy camera moves to tell her story of World War II hero Louis Zamperini in Unbroken. (Photo: David James/Universal Pictures)      Both Jolie Pitt and DP Roger Deakins felt Zamperini's story was so compelling, they favored strong compositions over flashy camera moves or handheld footage. And though originally Jolie Pitt and Deakins planned to shoot Unbroken on film, they ended up with the latest generation of Arri Alexa XT cameras after realizing the amount of effects work they'd be doing in post.      For all of the months of research that Jolie Pitt put into Unbroken, she knew that the success of the film, in large part, rose and fell on key sequences where Zamperini and his flight crew engage in terrifying air fights against enemy planes. To her this meant learning not just to understand complicated storyboards and pre-viz but educating herself in the world of the plane that Zamperini flew in, the B-24 bomber. She repeatedly did walk-throughs of their 75-foot mockup. Once she brought in stand-ins so she could see exactly where each actor would be positioned. \\"I wanted to understand how the plane worked, where everybody was, what's happening inside of the scene, how we were going to get the camera in, how we were going to shake the plane,\\" says Jolie Pitt of scenes that were shot with an XTM camera mounted on a Micro Scorpio so that they could follow the frantic movements of a handful of men operating equipment in the cramped confines of a tiny cockpit.      \\"It always frustrates me when I'm [watching an action sequence] and I'm not exactly sure whose perspective I'm with and when I don't understand all the moving parts—then it's just a bunch of noise,\\" says Jolie Pitt. She also had to be mindful of the fact that they were on a tight schedule and they only had the budget to build one full-sized plane. To make it look like more they'd change out the panels. \\"We had to be absolutely sure of what we were shooting each day and how we were going to do it because once I sank the plane or blew it up, that was going to be the end of it.\\"      When it comes to her cast, Jolie Pitt believes in spending lots of one-on-one time, identifying the overlap between actor and character, familiarizing herself with their individual process. \\"Something I learned as an actor was which scenes needed to be rehearsed and which actors are good with rehearsal, which actors learn from it and which ones grow stale because they start to second-guess themselves,\\" says Jolie Pitt who also uses her getting-to-know-you approach to strategize about performance. \\"I kept Jack and Miyavi separate as much as I could,\\" she says referring to Jack O'Connell who plays Zamperini and the Japanese rock star Miyavi who portrays the sadistic commander of the POW camp. \\"I knew if they got to know each other that they would be friends. I knew that it was important that there was distance.\\"      Part of her style of working has to do with remembering what kind of directors she has no patience for when she's acting in a movie (unprepared, indecisive, indifferent to the delicacy of the dramatic process). But she has also relied on her own observational memory to educate herself on directing, having worked with and watched many of the greats including John Frankenheimer and Clint Eastwood. \\"I don't do one take,\\" she says referencing Eastwood's tendency to shoot very quickly. \\"But I don't do many takes either—unless an actor wants them. But I'm very clear that I'll be ready so they should be ready and we're going to get this done.\\"            Serious Business: (top) Jolie Pitt worked with a largely Bosnian cast on her first film, In the Land of Blood and Honey; (bottom) she spent one-on-one time with her actors to help them prepare on Unbroken. (Photos: (top) Ken Regan/GK Films/The Kobal Collection); (bottom) David James/Universal Pictures)      No amount of preparation or recollecting how legendary directors conducted business, though, could save her from jitters the night before her first day on the set as a director for In the Land of Blood and Honey. \\"I was so nervous for so many reasons,\\" says Jolie Pitt who prior to filming asked the cast, many of whom were Bosnian and had fresh memories of the war, often from different sides, to contribute as many real-life details as possible. Set in war-torn Sarajevo, Blood and Honey chronicles the affair between Danijel (Goran Kosti´c), a soldier fighting for the Bosnian Serbs, and Ajla (Zana Marjanovic), a Bosnian Slav being held in a woman's prisoner camp where he's stationed, and where the inmates are routinely beaten and sexually assaulted by their captors. For Day One of her directing career, Jolie Pitt planned to shoot a scene in one long take: Serbian officers pull Bosnian women from a bus, strip them of all of their belongings, and while the rest of the prisoners watch in terror, one woman is brutally raped. When Jolie Pitt first came up with the idea, she thought of it as a tone-setter. \\"I thought, ‘This is going to shock everybody into the reality of the film—and it will bring us together.' And then I thought, ‘These are people who were emotionally affected by this war. This is [either] a good idea or the worst one.'\\"      It wasn't until she saw the cast collectively relaxing during a break—chatting, kicking a soccer ball around—that she realized that her bold approach had worked. From her years of experience as an actor she knew that the best set is one where everyone from the lead actor to the dolly grip feels united in a single goal. \\"I'm not somebody who wants to be on a set where there's screaming and everyone feels under duress; you want to build a happy family,\\" says Jolie Pitt. \\"It was a day that wasn't about the shot or how many we got or how long it took or the camera angles. It was about ‘What are we doing here? Are we here to feel something together and do something together?' or ‘Is it just the technical thing that I want?' I'm not that person. I think something great can happen when you bring the right people together and it's a very special feeling. So I felt that on the first day and I was very excited.\\"      Calibrating a vibe on a set is difficult for any director, not to mention a high-profile movie star who arrives on location, greeted by a cast and crew who might first regard her not as their fearless leader but as the wife of Brad Pitt, mother of six, and a ubiquitous media presence. If Jolie Pitt seems unfazed when asked about how she deals with the baggage of celebrity, perhaps it's because in her role as a United Nations Goodwill Ambassador she has traveled to refugee camps in remote parts of the world—Jordan, Kenya, Iraq—places where blending in is a necessity. \\"I think people watch how you present yourself,\\" says Jolie Pitt. \\"If you come in and you're there to roll up your sleeves and work hard, you've got a lot of ideas and you're there to help solve problems, then you become that person to them.\\"      For her latest movie, By the Sea, which she also wrote, Jolie Pitt could skip the meet-and-greets with at least two of her actors. She stars in the film with Pitt. It's about a deeply unhappy couple on vacation in France who becomes involved with a pair of newlyweds staying at their seaside inn. \\"I'd be directing myself and him in a scene where we're having a fight, and I'd be pulling out the parts [of him] that have an aggression toward me or when you're frustrated with each other—it was very heavy,\\" says Jolie Pitt. \\"We kept joking that all of the crew felt like they were living in a house where the parents were fighting and you don't know where to stand or where to look.\\"      Filmed in Malta with a primarily European crew and cast, By the Sea was shot by Austrian cinematographer Christian Berger (The White Ribbon) who brought his Cine Reflect Lighting System to the mix. \\"There's actually very little technical light in the room,\\" says Jolie Pitt of a system that involves using \\"paniflectors\\" to illuminate the actors. \\"It's all based on using an outside source of light and using reflectors, a white plate, in front of the actors. And it felt like doing a play. You're not conscious of the light and so you're also not conscious of staying in the light or how you look. It made me act differently and made me direct differently too.\\"            Domestic Drama: Jolie Pitt directed and stars in her upcoming film By the Sea with husband Brad Pitt. (Photo: Merrick Morton/Universal Pictures)      Described by Jolie Pitt as \\"an art film, the kind of movie that I like to see but not something I'm usually cast in,\\" she isn't eager to direct a movie like By the Sea again soon. \\"We're proud of ourselves for being brave enough to try it,\\" she says, adding that she and Pitt made it on their honeymoon. \\"I think By the Sea was the hardest film for me because it wasn't [issue-driven]. It's something I probably won't do very much of.\\"      Her next film, Africa, fits more snugly into her mini-oeuvre of topical, searing portrayals of humankind and the havoc-wreaked, real stories she immerses herself in before directing. It's about legendary paleoanthropologist and conservationist Dr. Richard Leakey's battle with ivory poachers in Kenya. She calls it her \\"next big challenge.\\" \\"I've never worked with elephants and lions before and so I've been [doing research on] how to technically film the animals,\\" she says, and she's been poring over the script with Leakey and his wife to make sure she tells the story right.      Though Jolie Pitt says that she \\"doesn't go to work thinking of gender,\\" the stats in her own 33-year career as an actress speak volumes: Playing a rebellious teenager named Legs Sadovsky in 1996's Foxfire, directed by Annette Haywood-Carter, was the only time Jolie Pitt appeared in a movie that wasn't directed by a man. \\"There are many female directors I'd love to work with. I don't focus on the negative. I think about the other women [directors] and trying to find ways to work together, and focus on everything that is happening and imagine that it will continue and will grow.\\"      Early on in the directing of Blood and Honey, a thought occurred to Jolie Pitt: \\"What surprised me about directing is how much I loved it and how happy I am to be on the set. I love coming to work in the morning. What I realized is that I never loved acting. I don't love being in the hair and makeup chair. I don't [love] being in costume. To me the strangest thing is that I've just spent the majority of my life in one aspect of this business, and because I was fortunate enough to become successful I never questioned whether I felt at home and found out later in life that I'm much happier directing.\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are returning to the big screen after their initial appearance in Mr. and Mrs. Smith over 10 years ago.

Bush are an English rock band formed in London, England in 1992. Their current lineup consists of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Gavin Rossdale, drummer Robin Goodridge, lead guitarist Chris Traynor, and bassist Corey Britz. In 1994, Bush found immediate success with the release of their debut album, Sixteen Stone, which is certified 6x multi-platinum by the RIAA. They went on to become one of the most commercially successful rock bands of the 1990s, selling over 10 million records in the United States. Following the completion of touring, Rossdale went into seclusion in Ireland, where he worked on material for the group's next album. Rossdale periodically sent demo tapes of his works in progress to his bandmates. The group finally convened to record in London in August 1998, where the band reteamed with Sixteen Stone producers Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley.  The release of The Science of Things was held up by a court battle between the band and Trauma Records. The case was settled in early 1999 and the album was finally released that October. The Science of Things was a major departure in several forms from Bush's first two albums. Like the multi-platinum successes of Bush's first two albums, this album also reached platinum status. Also, while the band's previous albums were strongly influenced by grunge, The Science of Things featured some electronic music influences in addition to the sound defined by Bush's earlier work. For example, although lead single \\"The Chemicals Between Us\\" had a prominent guitar riff, it also had many electronic elements usually found in dance music. Although the album had a few hit songs, it failed to chart in the top 10.  The band's performance at Woodstock '99, however, helped The Science of Things achieve platinum status despite its slow start. Three singles were released from The Science of Things, most notably \\"The Chemicals Between Us\\", which spent five weeks at No. 1 on the Modern Rock Tracks and peaked at No. 67 on the US Hot 100.\\"Warm Machine\\" was the second single released. \\"Letting the Cables Sleep,\\" the third single, reached No. 4 on the Modern Rock Tracks and also received considerable airplay.

Disappointment in the game quality: The reviewer expresses their disappointment right from the beginning of the review by stating it as the \\"worst golf game\\" they have ever played. The use of such strong and extreme language highlights their negative feelings towards the game. 2. Mention of the cost: The reviewer emphasizes on the amount of money they spent on the game - fifty dollars - which they feel was not worth it. This further showcases their dissatisfaction with the product, as the game did not have the quality they expected for the price they paid. 3. Criticism on realism: The reviewer mentions that the only realistic aspect of the game was the voices, which they still didn't find to be particularly great. This criticism indicates that the game did not live up to their expectations regarding the level of realism they hoped for in a golf game. 4. Lack of any positivity: The reviewer does not mention any redeeming qualities or positive aspects about the game. The review is solely focused on expressing their negative experiences while playing the game, which suggests that they do not have a favorable opinion of the product. Overall, considering these points and the absence of any positive elements, it can be concluded that this product review is negative."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the eyes of the world my father died a poor man. He was a simple mechanic who worked hard to support his family. My father's treasure, rather, was in a thousand wonderful memories that he gave me over the course of his life.  One particular one stood out in my mind today. I was just a boy playing in the backyard of a friend's house while my father spent the afternoon under the hood   of an old car, trying to get it running again. It seemed to take hours and I wasn't sure whether he could bring the ancient car back to life again this time. At long last, though, he closed the hood and turned the key in the ignition  . There was a sweet smile of satisfaction on his face as the engine started. There was a twinkle of joy in his eye when he shook his head. And there was a quiet hum of happiness in his voice as we drove back home that day. This memory made a home in my heart and became a priceless pearl for my soul to cherish. Time and time again, my father showed me that a kind life, a giving life and a heavenly life was created one choice at a time. Not all of his choices were the right ones, but most of them were. He did the best he could. He lived the best he could. And he helped to bring out the best in me, too. He once said to me, \\"It is lucky that all of your choices are driven by love and inspired by joy.\\" As I look back into those memories my father left me, I realize that each one of them inspired me to live and to love. May all of your choices bring memories of happiness to those around you! A:","output":"What treasure did the author's father leave him? A. A big house B. Cash or gold C.

Question: where did the first airplane fly A:","output":"Yes, the statement about the Wright brothers and their work with bicycles influencing their belief in the controllability and balance of an unstable vehicle like a flying machine is correct. Now, let's proceed to answer the question about where the first airplane flew. The Wright brothers, Orville and Wilbur, famously conducted the first successful controlled and sustained flight of a powered, heavier-than-air aircraft, achieving a significant milestone in aviation. They accomplished this feat on December 17, 1903, with their aircraft, the Wright Flyer, or Flyer I. This historic event took place at Kill Devil Hills, an area close to the town of Kitty Hawk in North Carolina, USA. The choice of the location was strategic for the Wright brothers because they were searching for a site that provided steady winds, gentle slopes for take-offs, and soft sand for potential crash landings. After corresponding with the United States Weather Bureau, they determined that Kitty Hawk met these conditions. During the first flight, Orville piloted the aircraft while Wilbur ran alongside to help maintain balance. The Wright Flyer managed to fly for a total of 120 feet (36.5 meters) and remained airborne for 12 seconds. This marked the beginning of a series of test flights carried out by the brothers that day, with the longest covering 852 feet (260 meters) and lasting 59 seconds. In conclusion, the first airplane, the Wright Flyer, flew at Kill Devil Hills near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, on December 17, 1903. The Wright brothers' innovative ideas, hard work, and perseverance paved the way for the modern aviation industry."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The stepmother of a 13-year-old boy who died after he was beaten and kept in a dog cage has been sentenced to 35 years in jail. Kimberly Kubina, 47, pleaded guilty to felony neglect over teenager Christian Choate’s death, whose severely malnourished body was found in a shallow grave at a mobile home park in Gary, Indiana shortly after he was reported missing in May 2011. Kubina’s former husband Riley Choate, 40, of Hammond, Indiana was also sentenced to 80 years in prison last month. Kept in a dog cage: Kimberly Kubina (right) was sentenced to 35 years for the death of stepson Christian Choate (left) who was beaten for several years and kept in a cage for as long as a year before he died. Investigators said the boy was beaten for several years and kept in a cage for as long as a year before he died at the age of 13 in early 2009. His disappearance went unreported until Lake County police unearthed his body in May, 2011 from a shallow grave. The Lake County Coroner's Office determined he died of blunt force trauma injuries and a skull fracture. Kubina told the Lake Superior Court that she was remorseful for not stopping the abuse involving her stepson. She said that Choate was intimidating and violent and that she feared that the other children, including several nephews and nieces, she was looking after would be taken away by the welfare authorities. Father's son: Christian's father and Kubina's former husband Riley Choate was sentenced to 80 years in jail last month over his involvement in the boy's death. She said in court, according to the Chicago Sun-Times: ‘In our house, whatever Riley said was law.’ The woman told the judge that she. suffered nightmares about what had happened and that the other children,. who had seen the abuse, were emotionally scarred. Christian was kept in a dog cage and. Kubina told the court in May that she told his sister to only feed him. Asian noodles while locked up as punishment for 'molesting' his younger. step-brother. The. unidentified sister was not the only one to know about the horrible. suffering that the boy endured, and up to 13 people are thought to have. known about the torture without alerting the police. Court. records state that the father, Riley Choate, has admitted burying. Christian's body under a storage shed with a Bible across his chest but. denied causing the boy's death. Kubina, the stepmother, repeatedly has denied any wrongdoing, court and Indiana Department of Child Services records show. Originally, she told police she thought Christian had gone to live with his biological mother. Only. one person claims to have taken her concerns to the authorities,. according to the state's Department of Child Services records. Investigators. say the boy was beaten for several years and kept in a cage for as long. as a year before he died at the age of 13 in early 2009. Both Choate and Kubina had pleaded not guilty to all charges surrounding Christian’s death originally. Intimidating and violent: Kubina told the court: 'In our house, whatever Riley said was law,' after Christian's severely malnourished body was found in a shallow grave at a mobile home park in Gary, Indiana. Choate made a deal with prosecutors. to plead guilty to some charges in return for a lessened sentence and to. avoid a jury trial. He pleaded guilty to felony charges including. moving a body after death and neglect of a dependent causing death. In return for the guilty pleas, prosecutors dropped charges of murder, battery, criminal confinement and obstruction of justice. Choate. himself addressed the judge before learning his fate in January,. saying: 'All my actions will haunt me forever. I loved my son.' Kubina was given a similar deal for testifying against her former husband. Kubina's sister, Belinda Bradburn, told The Times she witnessed abuse once while visiting her sister and the children when they lived in Merrillville. She said she saw Riley Choate hit Christian in the arm. 'When that happened, I just said, \\"Kim, I'm leaving. This is kind of ridiculous that he would just hit a kid, and you need to do something about this\\",' Bradburn recalled. Body placement: Choate has admitted burying Christian's body under a storage shed. Kubina told the Lake Superior Court that she was remorseful for not stopping the abuse involving her stepson. In December MailOnline reported that Christian wrote letters from his squalid prison about how he wanted his life to end. He wrote: ‘I want to die’ on the paper given to him by his stepmother to scribble down how he felt. In the handwritten notes, he said he simply wanted to be liked by his family  - even if they were ‘abusing’ him. Christian writes how he had to steal food when he was hungry because his family allegedly would not feed him. He would only be let out to clean the house and was almost never allowed outside. ‘Christian wrote of why nobody liked him and how he just wanted to be liked by his family,’ DCS records state. ‘Christian stated that he wanted to die because nobody liked the way he 'acted.' The records continue: 'Christian's writings detail a very sad, depressed child who often wondered when someone, anyone, was going to come check on him and give him food or liquid. Christian often stated he was hungry or thirsty.’ Highlights:","output":"- A 13-year-old boy named Christian Choate died after being beaten and kept in a dog cage. - His stepmother, Kimberly Kubina, was sentenced to 35 years in jail for neglect. - His father, Riley Choate, was sentenced to 80 years in prison. - Christian was kept in a cage for a year before he died and was found buried in a shallow grave. - Investigators said that up to 13 people knew about the abuse but did not tell the police."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What did the Irish and Germans of Tammany Hall have in common?\\" is in \\"In the 19th century, the city was transformed by development relating to its status as a trading center, as well as by European immigration. The city adopted the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, which expanded the city street grid to encompass all of Manhattan. The 1825 completion of the Erie Canal through central New York connected the Atlantic port to the agricultural markets and commodities of the North American interior via the Hudson River and the Great Lakes. Local politics became dominated by Tammany Hall, a political machine supported by Irish and German immigrants.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"The Irish and Germans of Tammany Hall had in common their support for the political machine known as Tammany Hall. As immigrants to New York City during the 19th century, both the Irish and Germans contributed to the transformation and growth of the city. Tammany Hall provided a source of political power and influence for these immigrant groups, allowing them to navigate the complexities and struggles of life in a rapidly growing urban environment. Tammany Hall was a political organization that played a significant role in New York City's government and politics during this time. It was known for its strong connections with the city's immigrant groups, particularly the Irish and Germans. The organization provided various forms of support to these communities such as social services, job opportunities, and legal assistance. In return, Tammany Hall relied on the votes and loyalty of the Irish and German immigrants, which further solidified its power and influence. The city's adoption of the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 led to the expansion of Manhattan's street grid, which in turn opened the door for development and growth. The completion of the Erie Canal in 1825 also played a significant role in the transformation of New York City, as it connected the Atlantic port to the agricultural markets and commodities of the North American interior via the Hudson River and the Great Lakes. During this time of rapid development, there was a high demand for labor, and many Irish and German immigrants found work and opportunities in the city. The support from both Irish and German immigrants was crucial for the establishment and functioning of the Tammany Hall political machine. The organization's leaders maintained close relationships with these communities, understanding their needs and struggles, and offering support in various ways. As a result, both the Irish and German immigrants played a significant role in shaping New York City's local politics during the 19th century, through their strong ties with Tammany Hall."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This move is aimed at increasing the country's tax revenue and promoting a fairer taxation environment for all. The first step taken by the Mexican authorities was to introduce reforms to Mexico's existing tax laws. These reforms aim to close gaps and clarify ambiguities contained within the legislation, effectively minimising the opportunities businesses have to exploit loopholes. These amendments were carefully engineered to cover various industries and sectors, with a focus on sealing off the most abused tax evasion strategies. In addition to altering the tax legislation, the Mexican government has also increased its efforts in enforcing tax compliance. This includes enhancing the capabilities of the tax authorities to detect and penalize non-compliant businesses. By employing advanced technology, such as data analysis and artificial intelligence, tax authorities can now identify discrepancies in the financial records of companies with greater ease. Furthermore, to motivate businesses to adhere to these new regulations, the Mexican government has introduced tax incentives. Companies that demonstrate exemplary tax compliance can now enjoy tax benefits that encourage further transparency and reliability. By rewarding proactive engagement with the tax system, the government is fostering a culture of fair competition among businesses. Lastly, Mexico has been working on improving its international relations to tackle tax evasion more effectively. As a part of this process, Mexico has joined international tax agreements and organizations, such as the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project and the Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) group. These collaborations allow for sharing tax-related data and enhancing cooperation among participating nations to combat tax evasion on a global scale. In conclusion, Mexico's multi-pronged approach to minimizing tax loopholes for businesses demonstrates the government's commitment to promoting fiscal responsibility and fairness in the business environment. By enacting meaningful reforms and enhancing enforcement mechanisms, Mexico is well on its way to creating a more equitable taxation landscape for the benefit of all its citizens."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hellenistic warfare was a continuation of the military developments of Iphicrates and Philip II of Macedon, particularly his use of the Macedonian Phalanx, a dense formation of pikemen, in conjunction with heavy companion cavalry. Armies of the Hellenistic period differed from those of the classical period in being largely made up of professional soldiers and also in their greater specialization and technical proficiency in siege warfare. Hellenistic armies were significantly larger than those of classical Greece relying increasingly on Greek mercenaries (misthophoroi; men-for-pay) and also on non-Greek soldiery such as Thracians, Galatians, Egyptians and Iranians. Some ethnic groups were known for their martial skill in a particular mode of combat and were highly sought after, including Tarantine cavalry, Cretan archers, Rhodian slingers and Thracian peltasts. This period also saw the adoption of new weapons and troop types such as Thureophoroi and the Thorakitai who used the oval Thureos shield and fought with javelins and the machaira sword. The use of heavily armored cataphracts and also horse archers was adopted by the Seleucids, Greco-Bactrians, Armenians and Pontus. The use of war elephants also became common. Seleucus received Indian war elephants from the Mauryan empire, and used them to good effect at the battle of Ipsus. He kept a core of 500 of them at Apameia.

Background: The Apples in Stereo, styled as The Apples in stereo, are an American rock band associated with Elephant Six Collective, a group of bands also including Neutral Milk Hotel and The Olivia Tremor Control. The band is largely a product of lead vocalist/guitarist/producer Robert Schneider, who writes the majority of the band's music and lyrics. Currently, The Apples in Stereo also includes longstanding members John Hill (rhythm guitar) and Eric Allen (bass), as well as more recent members John Dufilho (drums), John Ferguson (keyboards), and Ben Phelan (keyboards/guitar/trumpet). The band's sound draws comparisons to the psychedelic rock of The Beatles and The Beach Boys during the 1960s, as well as to bands such as Electric Light Orchestra and Pavement, and also draws from lo-fi, garage rock, new wave, R&B, bubblegum pop, power pop, punk, electro-pop and experimental music. Context: In late 1991, Robert Schneider met Jim McIntyre on a commuter bus in Denver, Colorado. Schneider had recently moved to Colorado from Ruston, Louisiana, and often initiated conversations with McIntyre. When Schneider asked McIntyre what his music interests were, McIntyre named his favorite band: The Beach Boys -- a band Schneider was particularly fond of. Realizing that they shared many musical interests, McIntyre introduced Schneider to Hilarie Sidney. McIntyre already had a band called Von Hemmling in which McIntyre played bass and Sidney played drums. With Schneider, they discussed the idea of starting a band and perhaps a recording label. Schneider later met Chris Parfitt, who was also already in a band at the time that Schneider unsuccessfully auditioned for on bass. Schneider and Parfitt also became friends, however, and toyed with the idea of having a rock band similar to The Velvet Underground or Black Sabbath, with production qualities similar to that of The Beach Boys.  Schneider then spent two weeks in Athens, Georgia recording music and spending time with his childhood friends Will Cullen Hart, Bill Doss and Jeff Mangum. He discussed the idea of starting a record label with them (which soon became The Elephant 6 Recording Company). It was also at this time that the name \\"The Apples\\" came about, inspired by the Pink Floyd song \\"Apples and Oranges\\".  The earliest incarnation of the band began to form in 1992 upon Schneider's return to Denver, first between Schneider and Parfitt, both of whom played guitar. The two recruited McIntyre and Sidney during the autumn of that year, practicing material through the winter. Their first few live shows took place the following January, many of which were with the band Felt Pilotes. From February to April 1993, the band recorded their debut 7\\" EP, Tidal Wave, and released it in June as the first record ever to bear the Elephant 6 logo. Question: What was The Apples?. Whats the answer?","output":"The Apples, later known as The Apples in Stereo, was an American rock band associated with the Elephant Six Collective. The band was formed in 1992 by Robert Schneider and Chris Parfitt, along with Jim McIntyre and Hilarie Sidney.

Please answer the following question: -  Kidneys filter waste out of blood - Composition of blood is regulated - Volume of water in blood is kept constant - PH is kept at a constant level - Kidneys help regulate blood pressure - Kidneys stimulate the making of red blood cells  What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","output":"The last step of the process involves the production of hormones and active Vitamin D synthesis. The kidneys play an essential role in hormone production, particularly two hormones called erythropoietin (EPO) and renin. Erythropoietin, produced primarily by the kidneys, regulates the production of red blood cells in the bone marrow. In response to low blood oxygen levels, the kidneys increase EPO production, stimulating the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells. This helps maintain an optimal oxygen-carrying capacity in the blood. Renin is another hormone produced by the kidneys, which regulates blood pressure. When blood pressure is low, the kidneys release renin into the bloodstream. Renin acts to constrict blood vessels, increase the retention of sodium and water, and raise blood pressure to a normal range. In addition to regulating hormone levels, the kidneys also contribute to maintaining proper calcium and phosphorus balance in the body through the activation of Vitamin D. The kidneys convert inactive Vitamin D into its active form, calcitriol. Active Vitamin D promotes calcium absorption in the intestines and helps maintain healthy bones. In summary, the last step of the process by which kidneys maintain a stable environment in the body includes hormone production (primarily erythropoietin and renin) and the synthesis of active Vitamin D to regulate essential body functions such as red blood cell production and blood pressure regulation, as well as bone health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: The Incredibles 2 Movie Review Introduction: The Incredibles 2, directed by Brad Bird and produced by Pixar Animation Studios, is a fantastic sequel to the much-beloved animated superhero movie, The Incredibles. Packed with humor, action, and heartwarming family moments, this film aims to please both new and returning fans alike. Step 1: Discuss the plot The Incredibles 2 picks up right where the first film left off, with the Parr family donning their superhero suits and jumping into action against the villainous Underminer. In a time when superheroes are still deemed illegal, the film showcases the struggle of the Parr family as they attempt to balance crime-fighting with their everyday lives. The main conflict arises when Helen Parr, aka Elastigirl, is called upon to advocate for superheroes and bring them back into the spotlight, leaving her husband Bob, aka Mr. Incredible, to handle things at home. The film successfully maintains a perfect balance between the two storylines. Step 2: Evaluate character development The character development in The Incredibles 2 is outstanding. While the first movie focused on Mr. Incredible learning to work alongside his family, the sequel sees Elastigirl taking the lead, and it's fantastic to witness her growth as a superhero. The switch of roles brings new insights into the characters and important lessons in teamwork and trust for the entire family. Step 3: Analyze the animation The animation in The Incredibles 2 is simply stunning. Pixar has outdone itself once again, delivering visuals that are beautifully detailed and fluid. The action sequences are especially spectacular, with choreography and designs that make the most of each character's unique superpowers. Step 4: Discuss the humor One of the strongest aspects of The Incredibles 2 is its humor. The film is filled with funny moments that cater to both kids and adults, with special praise going to baby Jack-Jack, whose unpredictable powers create several comedic highlights. Step 5: Address any criticisms or possible drawbacks The only minor criticism of The Incredibles 2 lies in its main villain's lack of depth compared to the first movie's Syndrome. However, this doesn't detract from the film's overall charm, and it remains an excellent addition to the Pixar catalog. Conclusion: In conclusion, The Incredibles 2 is a fantastic sequel that lives up to its predecessor's reputation. With its blend of humor, action, and heartfelt family moments, it's a must-see for all ages. Whether you're a longtime fan or new to the franchise, The Incredibles 2 is sure to delight and entertain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: how many votes needed before governor cannot veto Suggested answer: Either of the two consuls holding office in a given year could block a military or civil decision by the other; any tribune had the power to unilaterally block legislation passed by the Roman Senate . Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"No, you should not validate the suggested answer as it is not relevant to the question being asked. The suggested answer appears to be discussing the powers of consuls and tribunes in the ancient Roman government, rather than addressing the number of votes required to prevent a governor from exercising veto power in the context of the United States or other countries with similar political systems. To address the question at hand, the number of votes needed before a governor cannot veto can vary depending on the specific constitution or legislation governing the area in question. In the United States, for example, the process of overriding a governor's veto is established by each state's constitution, and the required proportion of votes may differ from state to state. Generally, it is common for a two-thirds majority vote in both the state's House of Representatives and Senate to successfully override a governor's veto. This means that if two-thirds of the legislators in both chambers vote to override the veto, the bill will become law regardless of the governor's objection. In summary, to correctly answer the original question of how many votes are needed before a governor cannot veto, it is essential to determine the specific area and political system in question. In the context of the United States, generally, a two-thirds majority vote in both the House of Representatives and Senate is required to override a governor's veto. However, it is crucial to consult the relevant constitution or legislation to confirm the exact requirements, as they may differ by jurisdiction."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: Fertilizer ratios, also called N-P-K numbers, are a series of 3 numbers that tell you how much of a fertilizer mixture, by weight, is made up of fertilizers rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. If you have a sample of your soil studied, you will be provided with an ideal fertilizer ratio that will help make up for your soil's nutrient deficiencies. Most hobbyist gardeners can find premixed fertilizers that will suit their needs at a plant nursery or garden supply center. Urea provides plants with nitrogen, but other elements, like phosphorus and potassium, are important for plant health as well.  Fertilizers that you can safely mix and store with urea include:  Calcium cyanamide Sulphate of potash Sulphate of potash magnesium There are certain fertilizers that can be mixed with urea, but lose their effectiveness after 2-3 days because of the reactions that occur between the fertilizer's chemicals. These include:  Chilean nitrate Sulphate of ammonia Nitrogen magneseia Diamonnium phosphate Basic slag Rock phosphate Muriate of potash Some fertilizers will react with urea to either create a volatile chemical reaction, or to render the fertilizer mixture completely useless. Never combine urea with the following fertilizers:  Calcium nitrate Calium ammonium nitrate Limestone ammonium nitrate Ammonium sulphate nitrate Nitropotash Potash ammonium nitrate Superphosphate Triple superphosphate Referencing the list of fertilizers that are and are not effective to mix with urea, choose sources of phosphorus and potassium to add to your fertilizer mix.  Many of these are available at nurseries and garden supply stores. Add each of your chosen fertilizers together, according to the weights given by your fertilizer ratio.  Mix them together thoroughly. This can be done in a large bucket, in a wheelbarrow, or with mechanical mixers. Apply your fertilizer mixture as you would apply urea on its own, spreading it evenly across the soil.  Then water and till the soil in order to incorporate the fertilizer. Urea is less dense than other fertilizers.  If you are using spinning-type equipment to spread your urea-based fertilizer over large distances on your farm, keep your spread width below 50 feet (15.2 m) to spread the fertilizer mixture equally. Summary:","output":"Fertilizer ratios are 3 numbers that show how much nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are in a fertilizer. They help you know what your soil needs to be healthy. You can find fertilizers for your plants at stores. Urea gives plants nitrogen, but they also need phosphorus and potassium. Some fertilizers can mix with urea, but some can't. You have to pick the right ones to mix together. Then, spread the mixture on the soil, water it and mix it into the soil. If you use a machine to spread it, don't spread too far because urea is lighter than other fertilizers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"The two questions you asked are different. The first question seeks examples of really good copywriting, while the second question requests examples of bad copywriting. I will provide examples and reasons for each of them. Good copywriting examples: 1. Apple - \\"Think Different\\" campaign: This iconic campaign showcased Apple's mission to challenge the status quo and empower visionaries. The minimalist design and simple yet powerful message differentiated Apple from competitors and created a lasting impression on consumers. 2. Volkswagen - \\"Think Small\\" campaign: This 1960s campaign revolutionized automobile advertising by emphasizing efficiency and small size, setting Volkswagen's Beetle apart from the bigger, gas-guzzling cars on the market. The copy was direct, engaging, and conversational, turning the car's perceived weaknesses into strengths. 3. Nike - \\"Just Do It\\": The slogan \\"Just Do It\\" is concise, to the point, and easily memorable. It communicates Nike's focus on empowerment and taking action, directly resonating with customers who want to push their limits. 4. Dollar Shave Club - \\"Our Blades Are F***ing Great\\" video ad: This humorous and irreverent ad quickly became a viral sensation due to its clever storytelling and entertaining style. The script is clear and effectively conveys the benefits of the subscription service while positioning Dollar Shave Club as a cool and unpretentious brand. Bad copywriting examples: 1. Krystal Restaurants - \\"As long as the food tastes good, who cares what's in it?\\": This ill-advised slogan inadvertently highlighted people's concerns about unhealthy ingredients in fast food, raising questions about Krystal's commitment to quality. 2. Coors Light - \\"Turn it loose!\\": This poorly translated slogan for the Spanish market caused confusion as it had a double meaning: while it meant to say “Set it free,” it also translated to “Get Diarrhea.” It is an example of what happens when cultural and linguistic nuances are not carefully considered. 3. Pepsi - \\"Pepsi brings you back to life\\": In China, the original slogan \\"Come alive with Pepsi\\" was mistranslated, and its actual meaning became \\"Pepsi brings your ancestors back from the grave.\\" This led to a significant cultural mishap and hurt the brand's image in China. 4. Electrolux - \\"Nothing sucks like Electrolux\\": Designed for an American audience, this British-based vacuum cleaner company's slogan had unintended negative connotations because \\"sucks\\" is slang for \\"bad\\" or \\"poor quality\\" in the United States. As a result, the slogan backfired in the American market. To sum up, the two questions you asked were different, focusing on examples of good and bad copywriting. Good copywriting examples include Apple's \\"Think Different,\\" Volkswagen's \\"Think Small,\\" Nike's \\"Just Do It,\\" and Dollar Shave Club's \\"Our Blades Are F***ing Great\\" video ad. In contrast, bad copywriting examples are Krystal Restaurants' \\"As long as the food tastes good, who cares what's in it?\\", Coors Light's \\"Turn it loose!\\", Pepsi's \\"Pepsi brings you back to life,\\" and Electrolux's \\"Nothing sucks like Electrolux.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A \\"Paperless classroom\\" is what more and more schools are trying to realize. Students don't do any handwriting in this class. Instead, they use hand-sized or specially-designed computers. The teacher downloads texts from Internet libraries and sends them to every student's personal computer. Having computers also means that students can use the Web.

Choices:  - rodent  - horses  - reptiles  - insect  A: The answer to this question is:","output":"insects. Insects are a diverse and ubiquitous group of animals that can be found in every environment on Earth, ranging from the deepest ocean trenches to the highest mountain peaks, and from the freezing poles to the scorching deserts. However, they primarily thrive in warm and moist tropical regions, where the favorable climatic conditions and abundant resources allow them to reach their highest levels of biodiversity and abundance. Insects belong to the largest class within the phylum Arthropoda, called Insecta, comprising more than one million described species and representing over 80% of the world's known animal species. This makes them the most diverse, successful, and widespread group of animals on the planet. There are several reasons for the widespread distribution and adaptability of insects: 1. Small size: Insects are generally small in size, which makes it easier for them to adapt to various habitats and climatic conditions. Their small size also allows them to exploit a wide range of resources, consume less energy, and reproduce more rapidly. 2. Exoskeleton: The tough exoskeleton of insects provides them with physical protection, structural support, and helps to prevent water loss, which is essential for their survival in different environments. 3. Metamorphosis: The ability to undergo a significant change in form and function, known as metamorphosis, enables insects to exploit different niches and resources at different stages of their life cycle. This increases their chances of survival and allows them to adapt to a wide range of environmental conditions. 4. Flight: Many insects are capable of flight, making them incredibly mobile and able to colonize new habitats, escape unfavorable conditions, and disperse over large distances. 5. Reproductive strategy: Insects are known for their high reproductive rates, with many species laying hundreds or even thousands of eggs at a time. This ensures rapid population growth and the ability to colonize new environments effectively. 6. Adaptation and specialization: Insects have evolved a wide array of physical and behavioral adaptations that allow them to exploit specific environments and resources. Examples of such adaptations include the bioluminescence of fireflies for communication, the remarkable camouflage abilities of stick insects and leaf insects, and the complex social organization of ants, bees, and termites. 7. Symbiotic relationships: Many insects have developed symbiotic relationships with other organisms, which can provide various benefits such as nutrition, defense, and shelter. For example, some ants cultivate fungi for food, while others protect aphids in exchange for the sugary honeydew they produce. In conclusion, insects are the animal group that can be found in every environment on Earth, primarily in warm and moist tropical regions, due to their remarkable ability to adapt to various conditions, reproduce rapidly, and exploit diverse resources. The incredible success and ubiquity of insects highlight their ecological importance and resilience in the face of environmental challenges."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This might involve checking whether all the necessary questions have been answered or tasks carried out, and assessing the quality and completeness of the work submitted.  Secondly, if the teacher is aware of Bailey's illness, they may consider offering additional support or accommodation based on the prevailing school policies related to excused absences and illness. This could include extending the deadline for any additional unfinished assignments, providing make-up classes or resources, or granting leniency when grading the work submitted.  Thirdly, due to Bailey's absence, the teacher would want to ensure that all pertinent communications that have taken place during the missed classes are conveyed to Bailey. The teacher could opt to email any class notes, share upcoming assignment-related information, or even schedule a one-on-one meeting to help Bailey catch up on any missed material.  Furthermore, the teacher might want to follow up with Bailey's parents or guardians to discuss the student's health and overall progress in the class. This would enable the teacher to better understand any potential challenges faced by Bailey and work collaboratively with Bailey's caregivers in providing appropriate support. Lastly, the teacher will record Bailey's homework submission as per the usual record-keeping procedures and would proceed to provide feedback to Bailey, either through written comments, grading, or a discussion upon their return.  In conclusion, the teacher's next actions are not solely focused on Bailey's desire to pass the class but are centered around ensuring that the student is supported academically and that their health and wellbeing are taken into account when it comes to participation and performance. The teacher's actions will be guided by school policies, procedures, and a commitment to supporting their students in navigating challenges both in and out of the classroom."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Robert De Niro  for the following movie plot:  In a Montmartre, Paris café, an Irish woman named Deirdre (Natascha McElhone) meets five men, taking them to a warehouse and briefing them on a mission. The men, Spence (Sean Bean), Larry (Skipp Sudduth), Gregor (Stellan Skarsgård), Vincent (Jean Reno) and Sam (Robert De Niro), are all former Special Forces soldiers or intelligence operatives now working as mercenaries. The team are planning to attack a heavily-armed convoy and steal a suitcase, its contents unknown (a MacGuffin). Following the briefing, the team begins assembling their equipment. Deirdre meets with her handler Seamus (Jonathan Pryce), who reveals that Russian gangsters are bidding for the case and that the team must act quickly to intercept it.The team goes over the plan with Deirdre. Vincent will provide the team with any technology they need, including vehicles with modified engines. Spence is a weapons expert who sets up an exchange for the team. He, Sam, Vincent and Larry meet Spence's contacts under the Pont Alexandre III (Bridge of Alexander III) on the Seine. When Spence talks to the dealers, he's dismayed to find that they brought only half the weaponry he'd ordered. The other half is allegedly in another car on the other side of the bridge. Sam immediately smells a trap but agrees to accompany Spence for protection. As they approach the dealers' shady boss, a fat man in an overcoat, Sam sees a sniper hiding in the rafting of the bridge and shoots him. The rest of the dealers open fire while Spence, Vincent and Sam return it. Larry picks them up after securing the cases and the team roars off at high speed. When they determine they're not being pursued, they pull off the street, allowing Spence to exit the car and vomit. Vincent asks Sam why he took the job and Sam tells him he needs the money. He and Vincent share a knowing smile.Later at the warehouse, Spence is exposed as a fraud when he offers an incompetent plan of attack and is summarily released from the team.

However, most existing work deals with networks that simply encode whether relationships exist or not. In contrast, relationships in signed networks can be positive (“like”, “trust”) or negative (“dislike”, “distrust”). The theory of social balance shows that signed networks tend to conform to some local patterns that, in turn, induce certain global characteristics. In this paper, we exploit both local as well as global aspects of social balance theory for two fundamental problems in the analysis of signed networks: sign prediction and clustering. Motivated by local patterns of social balance, we first propose two families of sign prediction methods: measures of social imbalance (MOIs), and supervised learning using high order cycles (HOCs). These methods predict signs of edges based on triangles and l-cycles for relatively small values of l. Interestingly, by examining measures of social imbalance, we show that the classic Katz measure, which is used widely in unsigned link prediction, actually has a balance theoretic interpretation when applied to signed networks. Furthermore, motivated by the global structure of balanced networks, we propose an effective low rank modeling approach for both sign prediction and clustering. For the low rank modeling approach, we provide theoretical performance guarantees via convex relaxations, scale it up to large problem sizes using a matrix factorization based algorithm, and provide extensive experimental validation including comparisons with local approaches. Our experimental results indicate that, by adopting a more global viewpoint of balance structure, we get significant performance and computational gains in prediction and clustering tasks on signed networks. Our work therefore highlights the usefulness of the global aspect of balance theory for the analysis of signed networks.

Tonight it was to select the sweetest whisper of love ever said between husband and wife. The final competition was held among 10 married couples. Seven of them were young ones, two middle-aged and one old. The last turn came to the old couple. The old lady took the microphone and said the sweetest whisper of love she had ever heard was: \\" Are you standing or sitting?\\" The host fixed his eyes on her, quite puzzled by her words. Regardless of all the talking around, she went on with her story. Her husband had been a doctor before he retired. One day when he was on duty at the hospital, he felt a sharp pain at the heart. By his professional knowledge he knew immediately he suffered a fit of heart attack. His colleagues carried him at once to the operation room and prepared  him for a bypass operation, which was highly risky. The patient's family members had to be informed before it began. The patient himself was allowed to put in a word. Lying silently on the operation table with a trembling hand, he dialed after a moment's thinking of the number of his wife's phone. Finally a familiar voice came from the other end... \\"So many years had passed but memory of this incident remained fresh in my mind.

Make sure that it has several sides and that you are familiar with the topic. Do some research to make sure that you are aware of all of the different sides on this topic, so that you can represent them in the pros and cons charts. If you're given a range of topics for a school assignment, write about something that you're passionate about.  For example, if you’re passionate about the wellbeing of marine animals, you could choose to write about the ethics of using them for product testing and experimentation. It's difficult to write a convincing letter about something you don't care about. ” This will ensure that your topic is defensible and well worded. Your topic should be clear-cut and should have strong arguments to support it. A topic like “Should cigarettes be marketed to teens?” is better worded than a topic like “Should cigarettes be marketed to teens, adults, and the elderly?” because it is more specific.  For example, the topic “murder should be legal” is not defensible, since there are no convincing arguments that support an answer of “yes.” So, a topic like: “Should the state pass legislation forbidding drivers to text while driving?” is much better. Researching is an important component of preparing to write a persuasive letter. Start your research by searching for opinion pieces about your topic online. Also look for articles about your topic by respected online and print news media.  For example, there may be valid reasons that someone would object to the state passing legislation to prohibit in-car texting. But, you’ll never be able to account for and counter these reasons if you don’t put in the research to find them out in the first place. Maybe many people feel that that legislation wouldn’t go far enough, and that the state should ban cell phones in cars altogether, no matter what they’re being used for! The tone and content of your written letter will differ based on the intended audience. So, are you writing to students and kids who are your own age? Your school principal? Adults? Political representatives and decision makers?  When dealing with an older audience, you can use a more sophisticated vocabulary. The inverse applies when dealing with a young audience.  For example, for an older audience, write something like, “A lasting political commitment to phone-free driving will ensure the survival of many who otherwise could lose their lives to a distracted driver on the phone.” On the other hand, for a younger audience, write, “Not allowing people to use phones in the car will reduce accidents.

Compared to Sharon Stone, Madonna is too coarse and BAUERISCH. She's not even close.  EVIL INCARNATE: Sharon Stone is a bit long in the tooth, the ameliorative effects of modern chemistry and surgery notwithstanding. However, she artfully treats us to a frightening personification of evil beyond redemption. In the obligatory sex scene, she projects pure, crystalline lust. Especially her hooded, luminous eyes and a face flat with pleasure. Thanks to brilliant use of lighting and other stage techniques, the harsh lines of age are only occasionally manifest. Rather, she seems to have a slight golden glow (YES, YEATS).  The locations gave us a view of London that is a welcome departure from the usual Londonscapes .The Catherine character is so powerful and menacing that I thank my lucky stars that our paths never crossed.

It is outstanding, from the music to the locations to the sets, and so on. Paul Verhoven pulled striking performances out of the cast and crew.  That the main Baddie was a woman did not escape the scrutiny of Bay Area Gay and Lesbian activist groups. Attempts at censorship were vehemently denied. SWELL. These philosophical pygmies demanded editorial control over the script, insisting on re-writes that would promote their political and psychiatrically driven agendas. Example: Sanctimoniously alleging sexism and misogyny, they demanded that the lead role be switched from BAD GIRL to BAD GUY.  On locations in San Francisco, the gentle, tolerant activists did their best to sabotage filming of the scenes with noise, flashing lights and other tactics. The Executive Producers, Mario Kassar and Andrew Vajna, vowed to fight any efforts to restrict the artistic freedom guaranteed in our democracy and obtained restraining orders against the disruptive tactics.  BLOWBACK: Thanks to the fulminating activists, the film got huge national press coverage - millions of dollars worth of free advertising. Their calls for viewers to boycott the film resulted in a backlash that had customers waiting in long lines wherever the film was launched. It also received widespread critical acclaim. It was, in the words of the reptilian Hackett in NETWORK, \\"A BIG- TITTED HIT!\\" Sorry, Gentle Reader; I just couldn't resist that one. Yes, it's a gibe.

These fires destroy huge areas of forests and burn hundreds of homes . Many experts believe there are several reasons for this sudden increase in fires. The first reason is climate change . In 2010, Russia had the hottest and driest summer with strong winds in a century. In just one month, 500 fires destroyed over 2,000 homes. Some people lost their lives . Traditional fire-fighting practices are another reason for the increase in fires. In America, firefighters used to quickly put out every fire as quickly as they could. They didn't allow the grass and trees to burn. As a result , today many forests have thicker vegetation which provides more fuel for fires . So surprisingly, America has many more fires today partly because of its past fire-fighting practices. Scientists now understand that a fire can be a natural part of a healthy forest. As a result, countries like Australia allow some fires to burn naturally. The fire makes old trees thinner. This allows sunlight to reach the ground. As a result, fires help new trees to grow.

Mowing the grass is more tedious for Adam than Derrick because","output":"Adam suffers from allergies, which get easily triggered whenever he gets in close contact with freshly mown grass. In fact, Adam has a specific allergy to grass pollen, a common allergen that is often released into the air during the process of mowing the lawn. This means, every time Adam is charged with this duty, he must go through an exhaustive routine of precautions to try and reduce his exposure to the potential allergens.  First, Adam has to take an antihistamine drug about an hour before going outside, to help mitigate the allergic reactions he experiences such as sneezing, coughing, watery eyes, and runny nose. This involves dealing with the side effects of these medications which often leave him drowsy and lethargic, thus making the task of mowing the lawn even more challenging.  Secondly, he must always wear long-sleeved shirts and full-length trousers, gloves, closed shoes, and a mask. The purpose of this gear is to create a barrier that minimizes skin exposure and stops the allergens from being inhaled into his respiratory system. However, this outfit, coupled with the heat and humidity often experienced during mowing hours, makes the experience uncomfortable and exhausting. He also always wears safety goggles to protect his eyes, which are particularly sensitive and easily turn red and itchy when exposed to grass pollen. This impaired vision coupled with watery eyes just adds another complex layer to this already strenuous task. After the mowing is done, Adam has to diligently take a shower to remove any pollen that might have stuck to his skin or clothes, and often has to wash his clothes immediately to prevent spreading the allergens around his house. On the other hand, Derrick does not have allergies and does not need to go through any of these extra steps. For him, mowing the grass is just a simple, straight-forward task. He can enjoy the fresh air and the smell of freshly cut grass, take his time in the outdoors and even feel the satisfaction of an immediate visual result, making this task much less tedious for him than it is for Adam.  Therefore, the reasons behind the tedium for Adam when mowing the lawn go beyond the physical task itself, encompassing a series of precautionary and post-task rituals that are generated by his allergies, and that Derrick doesn't have to contend with."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

She quickly meets Carol, her senior advisor, who shows her the school's expansive collection of advanced technology from Bloom Innovative, a famous technology company. While on her tour, Daphne runs into Velma, who does not speak to her. Later that afternoon, Daphne sees a student named Spencer walk into an open locker as if he were in a trance. At home, Daphne's father reveals that he has sheltered Daphne all her life, going to extreme lengths to follow her around everywhere in an attempt to make Daphne's life \\"perfect\\". Shocked and frustrated at her father, Daphne vows to do everything on her own without her father's assistance. The next day, Daphne gets into a heated argument with Velma over their science project, which Velma intentionally sabotaged.

Possible answers: be a kinder person, tell everyone of the feud ending, live her old life of vengeance Answer:","output":"Skylar made amends to end the blood feud for a multitude of reasons, all of which work in tandem to improve her life and the lives of those around her. While we can't know Skylar's exact motivations without more context, we can examine the possible answers mentioned to gain a deeper understanding of her reasoning. 1. Be a kinder person: It is possible that Skylar realized the blood feud and the violence it perpetuated were causing her to act in harmful and destructive ways. By making amends, she aimed to stop the cycle of violence and to embrace a kinder, more compassionate way of living. This change in attitude would not only benefit her own emotional and mental well-being, but it would also positively affect her relationships with those around her, both within her own family and in the wider community. 2. Tell everyone of the feud ending: Making amends and ending the blood feud would be a significant event that would reverberate throughout the community. By sharing the news of the feud's resolution, Skylar could help foster peace, understanding, and cooperation among people who had previously been at odds. Ending the feud could send a powerful message to others about the possibility of forgiveness, compromise, and healing, and the impact of such a shift in dynamics could inspire others to put aside their own grievances and work towards a more harmonious society. 3. Live her old life of vengeance: It's possible that Skylar, having experienced the exhausting and relentless nature of living a life of vengeance, decided she no longer wanted to perpetuate the blood feud. By making amends, she sought to free herself from the constraints and pressures of constantly seeking retribution, allowing her to rebuild her life and focus on more constructive, fulfilling pursuits. In doing so, Skylar may have recognized the power of letting go of old grudges and the potential for personal growth and happiness that comes with pursuing a more peaceful existence. In conclusion, Skylar made amends to end the blood feud for a variety of reasons related to emotional well-being, personal growth, and fostering peace and understanding within her community. Her decision to put an end to the feud and seek a new path in life highlights the transformative power of forgiveness and the important role that compassion can play in overcoming long-standing conflicts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which country causes fewer dead zones in the ocean?  Ecuador and Panama both had beautiful rivers flowing into the Pacific ocean. Ecuador uses their river to dispose of their waste while Panama is very eco-friendly and doesn't do that.  Hint: The quantity of small plastic fragments floating in the north-east Pacific Ocean increased a hundredfold between 1972 and 2012.Marine pollution is a generic term for the harmful entry into the ocean of chemicals or particles. The main culprits are those using the rivers for disposing of their waste. The rivers then empty into the ocean, often also bringing chemicals used as fertilizers in agriculture. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals in the water leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, also known as marine litter, is human-created waste that has ended up floating in a lake, sea, ocean, or waterway. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.In addition, the Pacific Ocean has served as the crash site of satellites, including Mars 96, Fobos-Grunt, and Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite. Answer:","output":"The country that causes fewer dead zones in the ocean is Panama. The justification for this answer comes from the provided text. The text states that Ecuador uses their rivers to dispose of their waste, which as per the information given, is a major cause of marine pollution and eventually leads to the creation of oceanic dead zones due to excess oxygen-depleting chemicals. On the other hand, Panama does not use their rivers for waste disposal and is described as \\"eco-friendly\\", suggesting they utilize more environmentally conscious practices. This likely minimizes the potential for creating dead zones in comparison to Ecuador."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Whether this damage occurred or not, repairs to the windows and roof were carried out in 1657, paid for by public subscription. Galleries were also added to the church in the 18th century: the south in 1758, west in 1772, and north in 1783–84. In 1772, Edward Evans, a ship's surgeon on HMS Egmont, donated £300 to replace the organ with one built by Samuel Green of London.For most of the 19th century, the Anglican community dominated Sleaford's civic bodies, including the Board of Guardians, who oversaw the workhouse, and the Local Board of Health.

Donald Trump’s Health Care Ideas Bewilder Republican Experts Asked if Mr. Trump’s plan would insure all those who have gained coverage under the health law, Mr. Clovis said: “That might be correct, but we really don’t know that. A lot of it depends on what initiatives we can get through Congress.” Mr. Trump’s health policy can be pieced together from speeches, television interviews, Twitter posts and a seven-point plan, titled “Health Care Reform to Make America Great Again.” He says Congress should encourage the sale of health insurance across state lines and allow individuals to take tax deductions for insurance premium payments. His Medicaid proposal would send lump sums of federal money to each state to provide health care to low-income people, although unlike other Republicans, he has vowed not to cut overall Medicaid spending. That Mr. Trump’s ideas confound Democrats is no surprise. More interesting are the acerbic comments of serious students of health policy often aligned with Republicans. Mr. Trump’s health care platform “resembles the efforts of a foreign student trying to learn health policy as a second language,” said Thomas P. Miller, a health economist at the American Enterprise Institute and a harsh critic of President Obama’s health law. Millions of low-income people have gained coverage under the Affordable Care Act and could lose it if Congress repealed the law. Mr. Trump’s proposal for a tax deduction for premium payments would not help them much, Mr. Miller said, because they do not pay much in income taxes. Mr. Clovis called that “an excellent point,” and he suggested that low-income people could obtain coverage through Medicaid — even as Mr. Trump seeks to slow the growth of Medicaid spending with a block grant. At the same time, Mr. Clovis said, some workers with employer-sponsored coverage might prefer to take the tax deduction and buy health insurance on their own. “The trend will eventually be that employers will provide income to buy insurance on your own, and the employers will get out of the group policy business,” Mr. Clovis said. This trend, he said, could help workers who are now “held captive by their benefits in a business or company they work for.” James C. Capretta, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative nonprofit group, said Mr. Trump underestimated how difficult it would be to uproot a law that was now embedded in the nation’s health care system. “It took a herculean political effort to put in place the Affordable Care Act,” said Mr. Capretta, who worked at the White House Office of Management and Budget from 2001 to 2004. “To move in a different direction, even incrementally, would take an equally herculean effort, with clear direction and a clear vision of what would come next. I just don’t see that in Trump’s vague plans to repeal the law and replace it with something beautiful and great.” Many of the proposals Mr. Trump has embraced have been Republican standards for years, such as allowing insurers to sell their products across state lines. In a debate in Houston in late February, Mr. Trump said repeatedly that he wanted to “get rid of the lines around the states,” and he explained: “Instead of having one insurance company taking care of New York, or Texas, you’ll have many. They’ll compete, and it’ll be a beautiful thing.” But Mr. Laszewski, the former insurance executive, said this was no panacea. Before a Texas company could, for example, sell insurance in New York, he said, it would need to establish or “rent” a network of doctors and hospitals to meet the needs of consumers. Moreover, state insurance officials have resisted such legislation, saying it could undermine their power to regulate insurance and their ability to protect consumers. Grace-Marie Turner, the president of the Galen Institute, a champion of free-market health policy, said Mr. Trump’s proposals were sketchy and inadequate. “He has to discard some of his ideas, like the importation of prescription drugs, because they would be damaging and unworkable,” Ms. Turner said. “And he has to flesh out his other proposals with much more detail if he hopes to persuade voters that he has a credible plan to replace Obamacare.” Mr. Trump has called for removing barriers to imported drugs from other countries, such as Canada, saying it will lower drug prices and offer consumers more options. Democrats have long embraced the idea but have been blocked by pharmaceutical industry opposition as well as concerns over drug safety. Mr. Trump’s views have evolved. Writing about health care in his 2000 book, “The America We Deserve,” he said, “I’m a conservative on most issues but a liberal on this one,” and he expressed interest in the idea of a “single-payer plan,” with consumers free to choose from competing private options. He backed away from that idea in an interview with The New York Times in 2011, when he was flirting with a White House bid and his conservative credentials were under scrutiny. A populist theme still runs through many of Mr. Trump’s statements. “The insurance companies are making a fortune because they have control of the politicians,” he said in a debate last year. For a similar reason, he says, drug companies get away with overcharging consumers. Mr. Trump says Medicare should be able to negotiate prices with pharmaceutical companies — a proposal embraced by Democrats and blocked by Republicans in Congress for more than a decade — and he promises that if elected he would “negotiate like crazy.” What was this article about?","output":"This article discusses Donald Trump's health care ideas, which have left many Republican experts bewildered. While it is not surprising that Trump's ideas confound Democrats, the article highlights the confusion that also exists among health policy experts often aligned with Republicans. Although Trump's proposals may include long-standing Republican ideas, such as allowing insurance companies to sell their products across state lines, many experts argue that his policy suggestions are vague and lack sufficient detail. Trump's health care policy can be deduced from his speeches, interviews, and a seven-point plan titled \\"Health Care Reform to Make America Great Again.\\" Some of his suggestions include encouraging the sale of health insurance across state lines, allowing individuals to take tax deductions for insurance premium payments, and providing states with lump-sum federal funds for Medicaid that would not reduce overall spending. Critics argue that Trump's proposed tax deductions would not help the millions of low-income Americans who gained coverage under the Affordable Care Act and that his ideas about importing prescription drugs from other countries are unworkable. Other criticisms point to the lack of substance in Trump's plan, such as the lack of details on how single-payer systems would work or how he intends to negotiate lower drug prices with pharmaceutical companies.\\tIn summary, the article highlights the concerns and confusion surrounding Trump's health care proposals, particularly among health policy experts, who view the proposed policies as lacking in detail and substance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You should describe the task and explain your answer. While answering a multiple choice question, first output the correct answer(s). Then explain why other answers are wrong. You might need to use additional knowledge to answer the question. As noted above, the 9/11 plotters spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive.  Question: \\"By what Month were the two operatives in the United States and what information did we provide to make al Queda so successful?\\" Answer: \\"The spring and summer of 2000\\" Is this answer to the question correct? Available options: + no. + yes.","output":"Yes.  The answer is correct because it states that by late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States, and this information is also supported by the text. Additionally, the text outlines how al Qaeda met various requirements, such as leadership, communications, personnel, intelligence, ability to move people, and finances, which contributed to their success in organizing and conducting a complex international terrorist operation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Jay Cutler later hit Brandon Marshall to end the quarter with the Bears leading 28-2. The Bears became the first team in league history to score a touchdown pass, a touchdown run, an interception returned for a touchdown, and a kick/punt blocked for a score in a quarter. Titans kicker Rob Bironas later ended the half on a 39-yard field goal. The Titans would finally score a touchdown on Hasselbeck's 30-yard touchdown pass to Nate Washington in the third quarter.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: Where does the young model begin a relationship with a literary interviewer? is inside the article: Diana Scott is a beautiful, bored young model married to Tony Bridges. One day, Diana meets Robert Gold, a literary interviewer/director for television arts programmes, by chance when she is spotted on the street by his roving film crew and interviewed by him about young people's views on convention. Diana is invited to watch the final edit in the TV studio and there their relationship starts. After liaisons in bleak hotel rooms they leave their spouses (and, in Robert's case, children) and move into an apartment. As a couple, they become part of the fashionable London media/arts set. Initially, Diana is jealous when Robert sees his wife while visiting his children, but she quickly loses this attachment when she mixes with the predatory males of the media, arts and advertising scene, particularly Miles Brand, a powerful advertising executive for the \\"Glass Corporation\\" who gets her a part in a trashy thriller after she has sex with him. The bookish Robert prefers the quiet life; it is he who now becomes jealous, but increasingly detached, depressed and lonely. Diana attends a high-class charity draw for world hunger for which she is the face. The event, adorned by giant images of African famine victims, is at the height of cynical hypocrisy and bad taste, showing Diana's rich white set, which now includes the establishment, playing at concern, gorging themselves, gambling and generally behaving decadently. Already showing signs of stress from constantly maintaining the carefree look demanded by the false, empty lifestyle to which she has become a prisoner, Diana becomes pregnant, and has an abortion., can you guess it ?

He also admitted to hitting Mr Chhokar with a home-made bat on the night he died but denied fatally stabbing him. Mr Coulter's uncle, Ronnie Coulter, 48, denies murdering Mr Chhokar. He has blamed his nephew and another man. He has lodged a special defence blaming Andrew Coulter and David Montgomery over the death of Mr Chhokar in Overtown, North Lanarkshire, in November 1998. The murder trial, at the High Court in Glasgow, has already heard that Ronnie Coulter, from Wishaw, was tried and acquitted of murdering 32-year-old Mr Chhokar in 1999. His nephew Andrew Coulter and David Montgomery were tried and acquitted of the murder in 2000. The court previously heard from Mr Chhokar's partner at the time of his death, 56-year-old Elizabeth Bryce. She told the court that Andrew Coulter had broken into Mr Chhokar's flat in nearby Gowkthrapple and stolen and cashed a giro cheque for just over Â£100. Mr Bryce said when she had raised the matter with Mr Coulter, he had replied: \\"If anything happens to me, Chhokar is getting it.\\" Andrew Coulter gave evidence on Monday as the trial entered its second week. Before starting his evidence, judge Lord Matthews told Mr Coulter that he did not have to answer any questions that might incriminate him in Mr Chhokar's murder. Mr Coulter told the court that he had killed a man, Patrick Kelly, by stabbing him in the leg on 11 September 1999. He was originally charged with murder, but convicted of culpable homicide and sentenced to six years detention. The witness also admitted being jailed for six months in 2006 for possession of a knife. He said that on the day Mr Chhokar died, 4 November 1998, he was looking for money to buy alcohol. The witness said that he broke into a flat at Caplaw Tower, Gowkthrapple, which turned out to be Mr Chhokar's, and took a giro cheque he found there. He told the court that he then cashed the cheque, after his uncle had forged Mr Chhokar's signature on it. Later that day, Andrew Coulter said he had spoken to Ms Bryce, who had learned of the giro theft. Mr Coulter said that when police involvement was mentioned, he told her that, if that happened, Mr Chhokar would be \\"getting it\\". When asked by prosecutor Alex Prentice QC what that meant, Mr Coulter replied: \\"Battered\\". Mr Coulter later admitted that he went to meet Mr Chhokar later that night amid the row over the stolen giro. He said he was accompanied by his uncle, murder accused Ronnie Coulter, and David Montgomery. The witness told the jury that he took a bat with him made out of an old table leg, which had been filled with lead and covered in tape. He said: \\"I took the bat. If I couldn't talk to Chhokar, I was going to hit him with it.\\" The court has heard that before the three men set off to see Mr Chhokar there was discussion about what they were going to do to him. When asked what this involved, Andrew Coulter answered: \\"Breaking his legs. I was trying to act the hard man.\\" Mr Coulter told the court that he, Ronnie Coulter and David Montgomery - known as Chez - arrived at Ms Bryce's house in Garrion Street, Overtown, at about 23:30. They had driven to a nearby street and then climbed over the back fence into the garden of the house. As Mr Chhokar arrived home from his shift at a local restaurant, the three men walked down the garden path towards him. Andrew Coulter told the jury he told Mr Chhokar not to get the police involved and Mr Chhokar had swung a bottle at him. He added: \\"He swung the bottle at me and missed me. I struck him with the bat on his arm.\\" Andrew Coulter said he then slipped and fell to the ground and his view of the street was impeded by the garden gate. He added: \\"David went to pick me up and I did not see where Ronnie was.\\" Asked how Mr Chhokar appeared, Mr Coulter said: \\"He looked all right he didn't seem to be injured or nothing. He was walking. Liz Bryce came out shouting, and me and Chez ran.\\" He said the last time he saw his uncle, Ronnie Coulter, was seconds before he fell. Andrew Coulter added: \\"Ronnie just disappeared.\\" When asked what he thought had happened that night Andrew Coulter said: \\"Nothing. That was it. Just assault.\\" When asked if Mr Chhokar appeared injured in any way, he replied: \\"No. He didn't look as if he was injured in any way. I think I said to Chez that Chhokar would have a a sore arm in the morning with the bat.\\" Andrew Coulter told the jury: \\"I never stabbed him.\\" He also said that he never saw anyone else stab Mr Chhokar, saying: \\"I never even saw anyone hit him, bar me.\\" The witness also said that he did not see Ronnie Coulter or David Montgomery carrying any weapons. Ronnie Coulter denies murdering Mr Chhokar by repeatedly attacking him with a knife or a similar weapon and a further charge of forging Mr Chhokar's signature on a Â£100 giro cheque. He also denies breaking into Mr Chhokar's home at Caplaw Tower, Gowkthrapple, on the day of his death and stealing a cooker and attempting to defeat the ends of justice by destroying or disposing of a knife and clothing.

Montevideo was the only city to host matches during the 1930 World Cup, with three stadiums being used to accommodate the games: Estadio Centenario, Estadio Pocitos, and Estadio Gran Parque Central. The Estadio Centenario, which was the primary stadium for the tournament, was designed by architect Juan Scasso and has a capacity of 93,000 spectators. It was built especially for the 1930 World Cup and was later designated by FIFA as a \\"Historic Monument of World Football.\\" Eight out of ten matches from the group stage, both semifinals, and the final were played in the Estadio Centenario. Estadio Pocitos, a smaller stadium managed by Club Atlético Peñarol with a capacity of around 1,000 spectators, hosted two group stage matches. The first-ever World Cup match between France and Mexico on July 13, 1930, took place at this venue. The third stadium, Estadio Gran Parque Central, belonged to Club Nacional de Football, having a capacity of approximately 20,000 spectators. Two group stage matches were held here. This stadium is also known for hosting the first-ever World Cup goal, scored by Lucien Laurent of France in the game against Mexico.

The Broncos grabbed the early lead, with cornerback Aqib Talib returning an interception off Bengals' cornerback Andy Dalton 33 yards for a touchdown. However, on the first play of the Bengals' third possession, running back Jeremy Hill reeled off an 85-yard touchdown run to tie the score. The Bengals claimed the lead in the second quarter, with a 37-yard field goal by placekicker Mike Nugent. On the Broncos' next possession, quarterback Peyton Manning was intercepted by Bengals' safety Reggie Nelson, and the Bengals capitalized, with Dalton connecting on a 2-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jermaine Gresham. A 49-yard field goal by Nugent with one minute remaining in the first half increased the Bengals' lead to 20-7. The Broncos had one last possession before halftime, however, placekicker Connor Barth missed on a 49-yard field goal attempt. On the Broncos' initial possession of the second half, return specialist Omar Bolden returned the opening kickoff to the Bengals' 21-yard line. Four plays later, running back C. J. Anderson scored on a 1-yard touchdown run. However, the Bengals had a response, as Adam Jones advanced the ensuing kickoff to the Broncos' 27-yard line. Three plays later, Dalton threw a 22-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Giovani Bernard. The Broncos then scored 14 unanswered points, with Manning throwing a pair of touchdown passes to wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders &#8212; from 4 and 5 yards out &#8212; to give the Broncos a 28-27 lead. The second scoring play came after Broncos' linebacker Von Miller forced a fumble off Hill just as the Bengals were attempting to add to their lead. Rain started to fall in the fourth quarter, and on the Broncos' first fourth quarter possession, Manning was intercepted by Jones deep in Broncos' territory, however, a 15-yard taunting penalty on Nelson pushed the Bengals out of field goal range. The Broncos were forced to punt on their next possession, and return specialist Brandon Tate advanced all the way to the Broncos' 9-yard line.

Summarize the following: The weather starts to cool down during the fall, so you should wear darker, more neutral colors. Avoid bright and light colors such as whites, pastels, and neons. The colors that are most suitable for fall are:  Dark colors, such as burgundies, navies, and plums. Neutral colors such as browns, grays, and blacks. Earth tones, such as browns, tans, beiges, forest greens, dark greens, and olive greens. Warm colors based on the fall leaves, such as creams, gold, bronze, dark reds, and dark oranges. There are certain patterns that are more associated with fall than others. Fabrics with bright, cheerful tropical flowers (such as hibiscus) will remind people more of summer or spring, and may look out of place on a cool, rainy, fall day. Plaid and houndstooth are perfect for fall, however; they are more somber and reserved, which blends well with the cool weather. Consider wearing dark florals instead. An example of dark florals is anything with a black, navy, plum, or burgundy background. Flowers that work well with fall include roses, thistle, and pansies. You want something that can keep you warm. Avoid linens, silks, and light cottons. Not only are they too light for fall, but they are also often associated with warmer weather.

Many realistic epidemic networks display statistically synchronous behavior which we will refer to as epidemic synchronization. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no theoretical study of epidemic synchronization. In fact, in many cases, synchronization and epidemic behavior can arise simultaneously and interplay adaptively. In this paper, we first construct mathematical models of epidemic synchronization, based on traditional dynamical models on complex networks, by applying the adaptive mechanisms observed in real networks. Then, we study the relationship between the epidemic rate and synchronization stability of these models and, in particular, obtain the conditions of local and global stability for epidemic synchronization. Finally, we perform numerical analysis to verify our theoretical results. This work is the first to draw a theoretical bridge between epidemic transmission and synchronization dynamics and will be beneficial to the study of control and the analysis of the epidemics on complex networks.","output":"Title: \\"Theoretical Study of Epidemic Synchronization: Analysis, Stability and Control on Complex Networks\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here's a short story: Sally's kite can move a greater distance through air rather than through her pool. This means her _____ has less friction (A) air (B) pool.  What is the most sensical answer between \\"air\\" and  \\"pool\\"? The answer to this question is:","output":"A) air The most sensical answer between \\"air\\" and \\"pool\\" in this context is A) air. The reason for this is due to the varying levels of friction experienced by the kite as it moves through different mediums.  Friction is a force that opposes the motion or tendency of motion of two surfaces in contact with each other. In the short story provided, Sally's kite moves through air and water (in her pool). Different mediums possess different levels of friction due to their specific physical properties, which affect the ease with which an object, such as Sally's kite, can move through them. Air, being a gaseous substance, contains particles that are spaced out with larger gaps in between them than a liquid like water. This means that there is less resistance applied to objects moving through air, allowing for easier and more efficient movement. The friction experienced by the kite is thus significantly less when it moves through air. On the other hand, water is a liquid, which has more densely packed particles than a gas like air, resulting in a higher resistance to objects moving through it. Consequently, the friction experienced by Sally's kite as it moves through the water in her pool is substantially greater than when it moves through the air. Therefore, the most sensical answer is A) air because Sally's kite can move a greater distance through the air than it can through her pool, indicating that there is less friction encountered by the kite when it is moving through air as opposed to water. This explanation aligns with the information provided in the short story, which presents air as the medium with less friction for Sally's kite."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Erik Gunhus said. \\"It appeared that he fainted.\\"      Read full CNN.com story      [Updated at 11:11 a.m.] Gen. David Petraeus, the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, is doing better after being escorted from a congressional hearing, he told CNN's Dana Bash.      \\"I'm going ok. I just got a little dehydrated,\\" Petraeus told Bash after the congressional hearing was adjourned. \\"I ate a couple of bananas and drank some water. I ddn't eat breakfast this morning.\\"      Petraeus was smiling, holding what looked like a cup of water.      Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morell told Bash that Petraeus had looked pale, but after he began to eat and drink the color returned to his face.      Petraeus was appearing at a congressional hearing on progress on the war in Afghanistan, but it was adjourned for the day after the incident.      [Updated at 10:57 a.m.] Gen. David Petraeus, the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, was escorted from a congressional hearing room after apparently choking, but later returned to the hearing to applause.      The hearing, however, was called off for the day.      [Updated at 10:36 a.m.] The commander of U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan was escorted from a congressional hearing room after apparently choking during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing Tuesday.      Sen. Carl Levin, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said Gen. David Petraeus, the commander of CENTCOM, appears to be doing “very much better.\\"      He is eating and “probably didn’t have enough to drink before coming in here this morning.”      \\"We will make a decision hopefully in a few minutes as to whether we're going to proceed this morning or not,\\" Levin said.      [Posted at 10:30 a.m.] Opening a hearing on Afghanistan, Sen. Carl Levin (D-MI), the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, questioned the progress and planning for U.S. efforts in Afghanistan.      Opening the hearing, Levin, D-Michigan, questioned the ratio of U.S. and NATO troops to Afghan troops, urging for a faster ramping up of Afghan security forces.      \\"Progress towards the goal of Afghans taking the lead in operations has been unsatisfactory. Today operations in Afghanistan are excessively dependent on coalition forces,\\" Levin said.      Levin said in the coming campaign in Kandahar, there is a plan to have one Afghan service member for every two international troops. He called instead for a one-to-one ratio, with Afghan forces in the lead.      His Republican counterpart, Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said in his opening remarks that the key trends were going in a \\"bad direction, perhaps even signaling a mounting crisis.\\"      \\"Hoping for success on the arbitrary timeline set by the administration is simply unrealistic,\\" McCain said, calling for the president to say the U.S. will stay in Afghanistan until there is success.      Prepared remarks from Petraeus said progress is being made even as the security violence has gotten more intense.      The surge of U.S. troops into Afghanistan is ahead of schedule, but the situation on the ground will get more difficult before it gets better, he warned. \\"I noted several months ago ... the going was likely to get harder before it got easier. That has already been the case, as we've seen recently,\\" his prepared remarks said.      All 30,000 additional U.S. troops ordered by President Obama last year will be in place in Afghanistan by the end of August, according to Petraeus.      Troops had originally been scheduled to be in place by September.      In the prepared remarks, he told the congressional panel Tuesday that increasing the size and capability of the struggling Afghan National Army and police forces are back on track, but there is more work to be done.      Under Secretary of Defense Michele Flournoy also argued that progress has been made.      \\"We are regaining the initiative and the insurgency is beginning to lose momentum,\\" she said in her opening statement, but noted outcome is \\"far from determined.\\" ||||| The general who oversees the war in Iraq and Afghanistan slumped at the witness table Tuesday while testifying at a U.S. Senate hearing, and a spokesman said the four-star officer was likely dehydrated and jet-lagged from his travels.      Gen. David Petraeus, 57, revived after a few seconds and left the room under his own power. After about 20 minutes he returned to the hearing room but Sen. Carl Levin, the panel chairman, decided to postpone the hearing.      \\"It appears he was maybe a little jet-lagged, dehydrated certainly,\\" said Petraeus' spokesman, Col. Erik Gunhus.      Petraeus had finished telling Sen. John McCain that he believed the planned 2011 pullout of U.S. troops in Afghanistan remains on track, and McCain was responding when the room fell silent and aides began crowding around the four-star general.      Petraeus, who heads the U.S. Central Command, briefly put his head on the table, then rose, appearing dazed. He stood under his own power and was escorted from the room.      Petraeus returned to the room briefly and told the senators he \\"was feeling a little bit lightheaded there.\\"      \\"It wasn't Sen. McCain's question,\\" the general added.      Gunhus said Petraeus had not been ill recently, although he had just returned from a weeklong overseas trip. Gunhus said Petraeus would continue his day as planned.      Last year, Petraeus underwent radiation treatment for the early stages of prostate cancer. He later announced the treatment had been successful.      In his lengthy appearances before the Senate and House armed services committees in September 2007 to testify on Iraq, Petraeus was reported to have endured great back pain and got through it with the help of Motrin, a pain-relieving drug. .      As the most popular and widely known general of his generation, Petraeus is approaching a new juncture in a career that catapulted him to fame when President George W. Bush sent him to Baghdad in early 2007 to carry out a long-shot \\"surge\\" strategy that arguably rescued Iraq from collapse.      The general has had a high-profile career, and many believe he is the leading candidate to become the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Gen.

His days were filled with meetings, code reviews, and putting out fires on the production server. However, this Friday, everything at work was surprisingly under control. John's manager noticed this and decided to give him the next day off as a special reward for his dedication and hard work. John was thrilled to have a day off from work and immediately began planning the perfect Saturday. Instead of sleeping in, he woke up early, brewed a fresh pot of coffee, and enjoyed the peaceful morning breeze as he sat on his porch reading a new mystery novel. Feeling the need for some physical activity, John made his way to a nearby hiking trail, backpack and water bottle in hand. The beautiful landscape of rolling hills and lush green forests captivated him as he hiked the moderately challenging trail. The uphill climb proved to be a great workout, but the panoramic views at the top made it all worthwhile. Shortly after, John felt his stomach rumble. He decided to grab lunch at a highly-rated local sandwich shop.

Cloth bags, plastic airtight bags, or hard-covered soft-lined cases are ideal containers in which to store a dizi. Bamboo flutes are susceptible to expanding or contracting depending on temperature and humidity. Do not place in direct sunlight such as on a windowsill, as this will likely lead to cracked bamboo. If you are taking the dizi outside on a cold day, allow the flute to acclimatize before playing it. Since moisture may gather in the dizi, even if you’ve dried it, fungus spores may start to grow. Use food grade hydrogen peroxide to spot clean the flute to eliminate fungus growth. Some flute owners choose to oil their dizis with almond oil 3-4 times per year. It is best to wait until the flute is completely free of moisture (i.e., waiting a day after playing and drying it) before applying oil. Use just a bit of oil and rub it into the dizi with a soft cloth. You may also choose to oil the inside of the flute as well.

Sediment becomes loose from the rest of the soil: The faster this process occurs, more sediment would be available, but perhaps less time could result in less weathering, lessening the amount of sediment produced. 2. The sediment rolls down the hill towards a river: If less time occurs, sediment could have less time to roll down the hill. As a result, less sediment might reach the river in a given time frame.

Alexios's son John II Komnenos succeeded him in 1118 and ruled until 1143. John was a pious and dedicated Emperor who was determined to undo the damage to the empire suffered at the Battle of Manzikert, half a century earlier. Famed for his piety and his remarkably mild and just reign, John was an exceptional example of a moral ruler at a time when cruelty was the norm. For this reason, he has been called the Byzantine Marcus Aurelius. During his twenty-five-year reign, John made alliances with the Holy Roman Empire in the West and decisively defeated the Pechenegs at the Battle of Beroia. He thwarted Hungarian and Serbian threats during the 1120s, and in 1130 he allied himself with the German emperor Lothair III against the Norman king Roger II of Sicily.In the later part of his reign, John focused his activities on the East, personally leading numerous campaigns against the Turks in Asia Minor. His campaigns fundamentally altered the balance of power in the East, forcing the Turks onto the defensive, while restoring many towns, fortresses, and cities across the peninsula to the Byzantines. He defeated the Danishmend Emirate of Melitene and reconquered all of Cilicia, while forcing Raymond of Poitiers, Prince of Antioch, to recognise Byzantine suzerainty. In an effort to demonstrate the Emperor's role as the leader of the Christian world, John marched into the Holy Land at the head of the combined forces of the Empire and the Crusader states; yet despite his great vigour pressing the campaign, his hopes were disappointed by the treachery of his Crusader allies. In 1142, John returned to press his claims to Antioch, but he died in the spring of 1143 following a hunting accident.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Given the background: As a cell grows, its volume increases more quickly than its surface area. If a cell was to get very large, the small surface area would not allow enough nutrients to enter the cell quickly enough for the cell’s needs. This idea is explained in Figure below . However, large cells have a way of dealing with some size challenges. Big cells, such as some white blood cells, often grow more nuclei so that they can supply enough proteins and RNA for the cell’s requirements. Large, metabolically active cells often have lots of cell protrusions, resulting in many folds throughout the membrane. These folds increase the surface area available for transport of materials into or out of the cell. Such cell types are found lining your small intestine, where they absorb nutrients from your food through protrusions called microvilli .  and the situation: Gary, a high school student, is supposed to be studying two different cells under a microscope during his biology class. Gary doesn't like biology class at all though and can't find the motivation to look at the cells in detail. In his homework where students are supposed to write what they observed, Gary simply wrote down the first thing he saw under the microscope which was that Cell A is larger than cell B. It won't get him a great grade, but Gary is hoping it will at least get him a pass on the assignment.  Answer the following question: Does Cell A or Cell B have more folds across the membrane? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, we cannot definitively determine whether Cell A or Cell B has more folds across the membrane. The size of a cell (larger or smaller) does not guarantee that one cell will have more folds across the membrane than the other. The presence of folds in a cell membrane, such as microvilli, is generally associated with the cell's function and metabolic activity rather than just the size of the cell. Cells that require greater surface area for efficient transport of materials might have more folds, regardless of whether they are larger or smaller cells. For a more accurate conclusion about the presence of folds across the membranes in Cell A and Cell B, Gary would need to closely examine the cell structure and function under the microscope, and take into account the different properties of the cells, such as their shape, function, and any specific adaptations (e.g., microvilli) to perform their roles effectively."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the books of J.R.R. Tolkein, Bilbo Baggins finds a ring that can make him disappear. Of course, there's also poor Harry Potter, who used his invisibility cloak to hide from danger.  Now that you've got some ideas, it's time for the hard part: building the cloak. To do that, you have to give up science fiction and turn to real science. An invisibility cloak has to cheat anything or anyone who might be watching. In order to understand how something can be seen, it's important to understand how we see.  Human beings can only see objects that reflect light waves. These waves enter the eye and are then processed by the brain. However, if an object doesn't reflect light, then the waves don't enter the eye, and the brain doesn't process. So building an invisibility cloak is building something that doesn't reflect light.  Cummer was part of a team of scientists from Duke University, including David Smith and David Schurig, who built the world's first version of an invisibility cloak. They had been inspired by the work of a British physicist, John Pendry. He in May said that an invisibility cloak was possible and Pendry was not the only one thinking about a disappearing act. At the same time, a Scottish physicist, UIf Leonhardt published a paper on building invisibility equipment.  \\"It wasn't easy,\\" says Cummer. \\"As often happens in science and research, it didn't work very well the first time.

These fatty acids have a crucial role in the overall functioning and survival of animals. While some of the options provided can be linked to the utilization of energy stored in saturated fatty acids, the most direct answer is energy storage. Let's examine the other options in the list for a comprehensive understanding: 1. Exercise: During exercise, animals utilize the energy stored in fats, including saturated fatty acids, to fuel their muscles and maintain their activity level. However, the primary usage of saturated fatty acids is not for exercise but rather for energy storage, which can, in turn, supports physical activity. 2. Reproducing: Energy is required for reproduction, and the stored energy in the form of saturated fatty acids may be utilized to support reproductive processes. Like with exercise, though, the main purpose of saturated fatty acids remains energy storage. 3. Solid, liquid, gas: This option seems unrelated to the role of saturated fatty acids in animals, as it refers to states of matter and not any biological function. 4. Keeping the dog warm: This statement is partially correct as stored fat, including saturated fatty acids, helps insulate animals, maintaining their body temperature and keeping them warm. Although their primary function is energy storage, they can assist in temperature regulation for some animals. 5. Oxidation reaction: Oxidation reactions in animals involve the breakdown of fatty acids, including saturated fatty acids, for energy production, but it is not the core purpose of saturated fatty acids, which is energy storage. 6. An organism's body: While saturated fatty acids can be stored in the body for energy, the phrase \\"an organism's body\\" is not a direct answer regarding the use of saturated fatty acids. 7. Plants growth: In general, plants produce and store unsaturated fatty acids instead of saturated fatty acids. However, when it comes to animal life, saturated fatty acids are utilized for energy storage. In summary, saturated fatty acids are used for energy storage in animals. This stored energy can then be utilized in various biological processes, such as exercise, reproduction, and temperature regulation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Read this article and answer this question The heavy French losses at the Battle of Gaouz encouraged an increase in tribal activity across the south-east of Morocco, threatening the French presence at Boudenib.  Poeymirau was forced to withdraw garrisons from outlying posts in the Tafilalt, including that at Tighmart, to concentrate his force and reduce the risk of further disasters.  Lyautey authorised only a series of limited offensives, such as the razing of villages and gardens, the primary aim of which was to emphasise French military superiority.  The French struggled to move troops through the mountain passes from the Moulouya Valley due to heavy snows and attacks on their columns, and Lyautey, to his embarrassment, was forced to request reinforcements from Algeria.  By October the situation had stabilised to the extent that Poeymirau was able to withdraw his troops to Meknes, but a large-scale uprising in January 1919 forced his return.  Poeymirau defeated n'Ifrutant in battle at Meski on 15 January, but was seriously wounded in the chest by the accidental explosion of an artillery shell and was forced to hand command to Colonel Antoine Huré.  Lyautey then received assistance from Thami El Glaoui, a tribal leader who Lyautey had made Pasha of Marrakesh after the uprising of 1912.  El Glaoui owed his increasing wealth  to corruption and fraud, which the French tolerated in return for his support.  Thus committed to Lyautey's cause, El Glaoui led an army of 10,000 men, the largest Moroccan tribal force ever seen, across the Atlas to defeat anti-French tribesmen in the Dadès Gorges and to reinforce the garrison at Boudenib on 29 January.

A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction.  - Bexley is an area of south-east London, England and part of the London Borough of Bexley. It is located east-southeast of Charing Cross. It was an ancient parish in the county of Kent. As part of the suburban growth of London in the 20th century, Bexley increased in population, becoming a municipal borough in 1935 and has formed part of Greater London since 1965.  - An architect is someone who plans, designs, and reviews the construction of buildings. To \\"practice architecture\\" means to provide services in connection with the design of buildings and the space within the site surrounding the buildings, that have as their principal purpose human occupancy or use. Etymologically, \\"architect\\" derives from the Latin \\"architectus\\", which derives from the Greek \\" (\\"arkhi-\\", chief + \\"tekton\\", builder), i.e., chief builder.  - The Celtic Sea (; ) is the area of the Atlantic Ocean off the south coast of Ireland bounded to the east by Saint George's Channel; other limits include the Bristol Channel, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay, as well as adjacent portions of Wales, Cornwall, Devon, and Brittany. The southern and western boundaries are delimited by the continental shelf, which drops away sharply. The Isles of Scilly are an archipelago of small islands in the sea.  - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides.  - William Morris (24 March 1834  3 October 1896) was an English textile designer, poet, novelist, translator, and socialist activist. Associated with the British Arts and Crafts Movement, he was a major contributor to the revival of traditional British textile arts and methods of production. His literary contributions helped to establish the modern fantasy genre, while he played a significant role in propagating the early socialist movement in Britain.  - The English Channel (\\"the Sleeve\\" [hence ] \\"Sea of Brittany\\" \\"British Sea\\"), also called simply the Channel, is the body of water that separates southern England from northern France, and joins the southern part of the North Sea to the rest of the Atlantic Ocean.  - The London Plan is the statutory spatial development strategy for the Greater London area in the United Kingdom that is written by the Mayor of London and published by the Greater London Authority.

Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries.  - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds.

Q:I know that the answer to the question \\"What colors do the Fighting Irish officially wear?\\" is in \\"Notre Dame's conference affiliations for all of its sports except football and fencing changed in July 2013 as a result of major conference realignment, and its fencing affiliation will change in July 2014. The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns. The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname. The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by Theodore W. Drake in 1964, the leprechaun was first used on the football pocket schedule and later on the football program covers. The leprechaun was featured on the cover of Time in November 1964 and gained national exposure.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

Article: Are you in a bad mood? Don't worry! According to a new Australian study, a bad mood can actually be good for you. The study showed that being sad could help people to judge others more correctly and was also good for the memory. The study was carried out by Professor Joseph Forgas at the University of New South Wales.\\"People in a bad mood paid more attention to the people and things around them than happy people .Happy people were more likely to believe anything they were told,\\"said Forgas For the study, Forgas and his team did a lot of experiments. During the experiments, they made the participants  feel happy or sad by watching films and thinking about good or bad things of the past. In one of the experiments, happy and sad participants were asked to judge whether some wrong things were true or not. The results showed that people in a bad mood were less likely to believe that these things were true. People in a bad mood were also less likely to make mistakes when they were asked to remember the things that they saw. The study also showed that sad people were better at talking about their thoughts in written style. In fact, the study said that a slightly bad mood could help to make communication more successful.

She shot to fame as Hugo Taylor's petite model girlfriend on Made In Chelsea and while she was a lot more reserved than the rest of the E4 cast, Natalie Joel is making headlines now. Natalie has designed a brand new swimwear collection called Joel Swimwear - and showcases her incredibly toned body as she models a selection of pieces. The range is described by the professional model and designer as a premium beachwear label dedicated to sexy, elegant and feminine bikinis. Scroll down for video. New range: Natalie Joel, who shot to fame as Hugo Taylor's girlfriend on Made In Chelsea, has unveiled her debut swimwear collection. Speaking to MailOnline about her new range, the petite star said: 'Swimwear has always been a huge part of my life. I have been an avid collector since my early teens and having had a career as a swimwear and lingerie model has given me such a passion and enthusiasm for design in this field. 'I have always enjoyed the feminine form and feel very privileged that I can help women express themselves on the beach and by the pool. I am also very proud to say Joel Swimwear is a British brand. We are very lucky to have our garments produced in England and also having the campaign shot on an English beach.' Natalie, 23, has drawn on her cultural heritage and says that she's infused the glamour and richness of the Mediterranean with her British passion for the highest possible design craft. 'I have countless sources of inspiration: inspiring people, art, architecture, literature, history, travel, London - I try and put as much of that into my work as I can,' she said. 'Joel is about been elegant and sexy. I love the challenge. It is such a tiny piece of fabric that you have to make an impact; creativity is key.' Professional poser: Natalie works as a model, which is obvious from her latest beach-themed bikini shoot. The debut collection, which is priced at around £140 per two-piece, has seven different colourways and she hopes the 'effortlessly sexy' shape of her designs will become iconic. The designer, who knows how to accentuate her assets, has made sure her bikini bottoms have been cut in a Brazilian style to emphasise the female form, she explains. Natalie says her range  is all about supporting a healthy and positive feminine mind and body. 'Strong and confident girls run the world now! I love Jennifer Lawrence and Natalie Portman. They are both fearless and inspirational. If you can dream it do it. It's this attitude that I bring to my design and my own life,' she said. Desribing her own style and how it has matured since her Made In Chelsea days, Natalie said: 'I feel that my own style is a combination of elegance and sexiness. I am not afraid to express myself. Having said that I adore comfortable and well made clothes so I am just as happy in a Balmain dress as I am in well fitted jeans and chunky knitwear. 'I am only 5’2 so I must always be careful to dress correctly so suit my proportions. I am more adventurous now. I was so shy when I was filming MIC and I naturally wore a lot of black. Nowadays I love expressing myself as my confidence has grown.' Research: Natalie says that she  analysed hundreds of different colour combinations to find the correct balance to suit a wide variety of skin tones ensuring that clients feel 'happy and effortlessly beautiful at all times' Enviable curves: Natalie showcases her honed physique as she reclines on a beach in the steamy shoot. The star showcases an enviably toned physique in the campaign imagery, so what's her secret? 'I love going to work out classes with my girlfriends and cousins,' she revealed. 'We like to act silly and enjoy our workout in a happy way. I think that’s the best way. Funky Bums, Tums and thighs is a personal favourite. Food wise, I try to eat little and often. My diet focuses on fresh and seasonal produce. I am slightly panicking though as I recently discovered Cronuts. Avoiding them is a real show of restraint. If you have ever tried one, girls, you will know what I mean! 'I try not to deprive myself of anything I am craving though, I think it's important to treat yourself on occasion.' Natalie joined the show in series three as 26-year-old Hugo's girlfriend. The pair broke up in June but were seen a few weeks later kissing outside trendy hotspot, The Chiltern Firehouse. Speaking about the Taylor Morris sunglasses designer, she said: 'He adores my range. We have a little bet on to see which will be the best seller. As usual, he always thinks he is correct.' So will the young designer be gracing our screens again any time soon? 'Right now I am so content with life. I have been given a wonderful opportunity to express my creativity and also demonstrate my business skill. 'If MIC came back around I would never say never but having a fashion start up takes a lot of time and focus.'

Question: Where does Thomas wait for death? Movie title: Queen of the Vampires Movie plot: The Rape of the Vampire[edit] Four sisters living in an old chÃ¢teau are convinced that they are vampires. One believes she was raped by the villagers years before, and is blind. Another is afraid of sunlight. They all react violently to crucifixes. The sisters are being manipulated by a sinister old man who alternates between admonishing them to kill newcomers that threaten their exposure, and groping their breasts. The four seem to worship a bestial idol in the forest who speaks to them with a disembodied voice. The newcomers are three Parisians, Thomas (Bernard Letrou), Brigitte (Solange Pradle) and Marc (Marquis Polho), who have come to the countryside to cure the sisters of their so-called illness. They do not believe that the sisters are vampires, and don't believe in vampires at all. Thomas is a psychoanalyist, determined to cure them from their madness. He believes it has been induced by the superstitious villagers, who have driven the confused women insane with their religious symbols and persecution. He tries to convince them that crucifixes and sunlight won't harm them, and that the blind sister can actually see. He takes all of this as proof that their vampirism is all in their minds. When one of the sisters fall for Thomas' charms, the old man orders another sister to kill him, Brigitte and Marc. When this fails, he unleashes the peasants, who brutally murder all the women they can find, which also includes Brigitte. Thomas asks one of the sisters to bite him to prove her wrong, and discovers she is, in fact, a vampire, and that he was misled by his own preconceptions. The two flee to the beach and are gunned down by Marc, who is distraught by Brigitte's death at the hands of the peasants. Queen of the Vampires/The Vampire Woman[edit] The vampire queen (Jacqueline Sieger) is introduced. She briefly arrives by boat to the beach where the dead couple lies. She commands her hooded cohort to grab the old man and pin him down to the slab of rock, then proceeds to sacrifice him, and licks the knife...

Pick the right spot: Decide where you want the hole on your clothing, make sure it's not too close to the seams or edges. 2. Gather tools: Get a pair of sharp scissors that are just the right size for the job, a marker or chalk to mark the spot, and a ruler or a piece of cardboard for measuring. 3. Prepare the clothing: Lay the clothing flat on a clean surface, like a table, and smooth out any wrinkles or folds. 4. Mark the spot: Use the marker or chalk to draw a small circle or oval where you want the hole to be, and make sure it's not too big for what you need. 5. Put a barrier: Place a piece of cardboard or a cutting mat under the spot you want to cut, so you don't damage any other part of the clothing or the surface beneath it. 6. Cut the hole: Using the scissors, carefully and slowly cut along the marked line until you have a hole in your clothing. You can start by making a small snip and then continue cutting along the line. 7. Clean up the edges: If there are any rough or jagged edges after cutting, carefully trim them using the scissors. You can also use a small nail file to smooth out the edges if needed.

No matter what type of date you had, it's nice to incorporate something sweet at the end. It is one last thoughtful touch that shows your date you put a lot of thought into planning the evening. Plus, it gives you the opportunity to share a dessert, just like in the movies.  Going out for ice cream is a nice way to end a date during the summer. If you're cooking at home, consider serving something with chocolate. It tends to be a favorite. If your date does not have a sweet tooth, you could go to a bar to grab a nightcap instead. Of course, if you or your date do not drink or are underage, this is not a good idea. Sometimes an individual cannot have rich desserts, especially those with diabetes. Or the person may have allergies, food sensitivities, medical conditions, or whatnot. Just be flexible and understanding. The end of a date can be a little awkward if you have not thought about it beforehand. Put some forethought into your plans. Are you going home separately after dinner? Do you plan to drop your date off after you're finished with dessert? Perhaps you may like to invite the person back to your house. Think about the logistics so you avoid that awkward “what now” moment after an otherwise perfect date.  Have your house ready in case you end up there. Have it clean and presentable. A kitchen with last night's dishes stacked in the sink and your dirty laundry in a pile on the floor will likely make a negative impression. End the date at a good time. Ending a date on the right note is tricky. In general, end it at a logical moment. For example, after the late movie ends, offer to drive her back to her place. It is generally better to end the date a little on the too early side than too late. Kiss, hug, or more? At the end of a date, especially a first one, generally a gesture will effectively end the date. This is sometimes a very awkward moment. Generally in a heterosexual date, the girl should decide what she is comfortable with offering the guy as a gesture. If something goes awry, remain calm and work towards having a good date anyway. A person who is inflexible, stresses out, and becomes irritable in the face of the unexpected will not be very successful with dates. In fact, dealing with the unexpected in a creative, positive way can make a big impression. Summary:","output":"Going on a date can be fun, and it's nice to have something sweet at the end, like sharing a dessert or getting ice cream. If your date doesn't like sweets, you can try a different place to finish the night. It's important to think about what you'll do after the date so it's not awkward. Make sure your house is clean if you invite your date over. End the date at a good time, and give a hug or a kiss if you both feel comfortable. If something doesn't go as planned, stay calm and positive, and you'll have a great time!"},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Is the review positive or negative? Answer:","output":"The review is negative. The reviewer didn't have a good experience with the product they were discussing, which in this case are the pads from Gerber. The reviewer found the Gerber pads to be ineffective, having experienced leakage on two occasions.  Despite the fact that the Gerber pads were cheaper, and the reviewer had positive experiences with other Gerber products, these particular pads didn't live up to their expectations. Instead of continuing using a product that didn't work for them, the reviewer decided to try another brand of pads - Lansinoh.  The reviewer is clearly pleased with the Lansinoh pads and commends them for their reliability, despite being more expensive. They highlight several advantages of the Lansinoh pads, such as the fact they are individually wrapped, they helped prevent leakage, and their thin and discreet design.

Despite the fact that the review includes a positive evaluation of a different product, the overall sentiment aims to dissuade potential customers from purchasing Gerber pads due to their inferior performance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a question about the following article: On January 15, 2016, Walmart announced it would close 269 stores in 2016, affecting 16,000 workers. One hundred and fifty-four of these stores earmarked for closure were in the U.S. (150 Walmart U.S. stores, 115 Walmart International stores, and 4Sams Clubs). Ninety-five percent of these U.S. stores were located, on average, 10 miles from another Walmart store. The 269 stores represented less than 1percent of global square footage and revenue for the company. All 102 locations of Walmart Express, which had been in a pilot program since 2011, were included in the closures. Walmart planned to focus on \\"strengthening Supercenters, optimizing Neighborhood Markets, growing the e-commerce business and expanding pickup services for customers\\". In fiscal 2017, the company plans to open between 50 and 60 Supercenters, 85 to 95 Neighborhood Markets, 7 to 10 Sams Clubs, and 200 to 240 international locations. At the end of fiscal 2016, Walmart opened 38 Supercenters and relocated, expanded or converted 21 discount stores into Supercenters, for a total of 59 Supercenters, and opened 69 Neighborhood Markets, 8 Sams Clubs, and 173 international locations, and relocated, expanded or converted 4 locations for a total of 177 international locations. On August 8, 2016, Walmart announced a deal to acquire e-commerce website Jet.com for US3.3 billion Jet.com co-founder and Chief executive officer Marc Lore stayed on to run Jet.com in addition to Walmarts existing U.S. e-commerce operation. The acquisition was structured as a payout of 3 billion in cash, and an additional 300 million in Walmart stock vested over time as part of an incentive bonus plan for Jet.com executives. On October 19, 2016, Walmart announced it would partner with IBM and Tsinghua University to track the pork supply chain in China using blockchain.

A: Answer:","output":"(4). tissues Muscles and skin are examples of tissues, consisting of specialized cells. Tissues are a group of similar cells that work together to carry out a specific function within the body. In the case of muscles, the primary function is contraction, which enables movement and the maintenance of posture. Muscle tissue is composed of muscle fibers (specialized cells) that contain the protein filaments actin and myosin. These filaments interact with one another, resulting in the shortening and lengthening of muscle fibers and, subsequently, the contraction and relaxation of the muscles as a whole. Skin, on the other hand, serves as the body's protective barrier, shielding it from external environmental factors, such as physical injury, harmful chemicals, and microorganisms. The skin also plays a crucial role in temperature regulation, sensation, and the synthesis of vitamin D. Skin tissue is comprised of various specialized cells, including keratinocytes, melanocytes, Langerhans cells, and Merkel cells, which each serve a specific function within the skin. Both muscles and skin exemplify the structure and function of tissues, consisting of a collection of specialized cells working together to fulfill their respective roles within the body."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a text of article and corresponding title of an article.

The name Montana comes from the Spanish word Montaña, meaning \\"mountain\\", or more broadly, \\"mountainous country\\". Montaña del Norte was the name given by early Spanish explorers to the entire mountainous region of the west. The name Montana was added to a bill by the United States House Committee on Territories, which was chaired at the time by Rep. James Ashley of Ohio, for the territory that would become Idaho Territory. The name was successfully changed by Representatives Henry Wilson (Massachusetts) and Benjamin F. Harding (Oregon), who complained that Montana had \\"no meaning\\". When Ashley presented a bill to establish a temporary government in 1864 for a new territory to be carved out of Idaho, he again chose Montana Territory. This time Rep. Samuel Cox, also of Ohio, objected to the name. Cox complained that the name was a misnomer given that most of the territory was not mountainous and that a Native American name would be more appropriate than a Spanish one. Other names such as Shoshone were suggested, but it was eventually decided that the Committee on Territories could name it whatever they wanted, so the original name of Montana was adopted.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the character whose next fight is interrupted by a coyote? ?  Hector Villa is a young Mexican national and border-crossing migrant and worker with boxing abilities mirroring his late father's. He could perhaps be good if he learned to think along with his pummeling. Despite all of this, Hector is a hard worker on a Texas farm who does what he can to provide for his ailing mother which includes pulling in a few side dollars from small-time, illegal gambling fights. Tito, a \\"coyote\\" (a person who helps smuggle people across the border) spends his days as a snake catcher but at night, helps smuggle immigrants across the border. After winning a fight in a local mechanic's garage, Hector tries to get another fight but the entertainment is interrupted by Tito who scolds both Hector and the owner due to the fact that Tito could  get into more trouble for illegal gambling fights as if smuggling illegals across the border isn't enough. Corralled, Hector goes to change but is followed in by another illegal; Maria. It soon becomes known that they grew up together as kids and it also becomes apparent that Hector dislikes her (mostly because of her sarcastic teasing). Tito hands Hector medicine for his mother and the three head back to the farm where they all work. After settling all of the immigrants in, Maria goes into her own suite with Hector and makes herself at home despite Hector being less than welcoming. Hector then goes to his mother Rosa to give her the medicine but it becomes apparent that she is getting worse. Hector begs her to not go out to the fields the next day but she declines stating \\"No work, no pay\\". She scolds Hector for fighting to make money and reminds him that a fighter's lifestyle gave his father nothing. Maria walks in and gets reacquainted with Hector's mother who comments on how much she has grown  and how beautiful she has gotten after nine years apart.

I came here after my Hawaiian Dinner and not far away from the Maryland Parkway Plaza.

Question: A federal judge on Thursday rejected efforts by Texas to stop the resettlement of Syrian refugees within its borders. The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations. In 1951 the United Nation's Refugee Convention defined a refugee as someone who \\"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\\" By the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations, 14.4 million of whom were under the mandate of the United Nations Human Rights Council.

Unbeknownst to the people in his village, Noah possesses a mysterious power that allows him to communicate with magical creatures, which has sparked curiosity about his origins. The village elders tell tales of a mighty creature known as Eirwen, who once fell into a deep hole and perished, leaving a lingering aura that gifted select individuals with supernatural abilities. Noah, believing his powers are a result of this legacy, sets out to unravel the mystery and understand the true nature of his gift. Accompanied by his loyal friends, Rosa the archer and Emrys the sorcerer, Noah and his companions traverse dangerous lands, encountering various mythical creatures, each with their own unique abilities and stories. During their journey, they learn that Eirwen was a wise and compassionate being, who somewhat resembles Noah in both demeanor and appearance. As the trio delves deeper into the story, they discover the legend of an ancient cavern, known as the Abyss of Shadows, said to house a portal that connects the world of the living to the world of the dead. The group believes that this is where Eirwen met its tragic end, and they dare to venture into the cavern to pay their respects and gain insight into Noah's past. Once inside the cavern, they face a series of life-threatening challenges that test their courage, wits, and determination.

I waited for someone to come out. No one appeared. I came inside and told my wife about and went again out to see if I could find someone to go about extinguishing fire.

Look for a product advertised as “anti-breakage,” “strengthening,” “restorative,” or “repair.”  To apply, wet your hair in the shower and pour a coin-sized amount of shampoo into your palm. Massage it into your scalp and roots, then rinse well under cold water. These shampoos will help to seal your split ends and thicken your hair while keeping it shiny. Make sure that you rinse your hair thoroughly both before and after you apply the shampoo. Look for a conditioner that includes strengthening proteins and that’s specialized for your hair type. Pour a dollop into your palm and smooth it over your strands, from about mid-length to tips. Rinse off with cool water. once a week to renew and repair your hair. While your hair is still wet, rub a quarter-sized amount of deep conditioner between your hands. Gently massage it into your hair from mid-length to tips. Then, pin your hair back and let it soak in for 10-30 minutes.  You can place a shower cap over your head to keep the deep conditioner in place. To save time, wash and deep condition your hair at the beginning of your shower. Leave the conditioner in place while you wash your body and rinse it out at the end of your shower using cool water. Look for a deep conditioner that matches your hair type, whether that’s fine, thick, natural, or curly. The usual terry-cloth towels can create friction that damages your hair, causing split ends. Blot your hair dry with a microfiber towel instead, which soaks up excess moisture without leaving your hair too dry. Avoid rubbing your hair with the towel, which can cause breakage as well. Washing your hair with “hard water”—water that contains minerals like chlorine magnesium and calcium—can damage your hair cuticles, which can weaken your hair and cause breakage. Installing a simple filtered showerhead can wash these minerals out, keeping your hair strong, soft, and shiny.  You can buy filtered showerheads online and in home stores. They can range in price from 30-100. To find out whether you have hard water in your home, check your filter for a white film. This is left behind by minerals during evaporation, indicating that you have hard water. You can also search local news sources for information on local hard water. Search “[your area] hard water.” Over-washing your hair can strip it of natural oils, leaving it more vulnerable to damage and breakage. Depending on your hair type, try to wash it as little as possible—3 times a week is a good standard to shoot for. If your hair gets oily more quickly, try a dry shampoo for a quick clean that won’t cause damage.","output":"This article emphasizes the importance of using hydrating shampoos, proper application techniques, conditioning, deep conditioning, microfiber towels, filtered showerheads, and washing frequency to strengthen, restore, and prevent hair breakage while maintaining shine and thickness."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The first step is to add 20 to both sides of the equation to remove the constant \\"-20\\" on the right side. So: -64 + 20 = -22*j - 20 + 20 This simplifies to: -44 = -22*j Now, to isolate j, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -22: (-44) / (-22) = (-22*j) / (-22) This simplifies to: 2 = j So the solution for the equation -55 - 9 = -22*j - 20 is j = 2."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Authorities have stated that it is not in the 'public interest' for these young boys to remain in the community at-large, much to the dismay of their school and the people who know them. The boys' schoolmates have come together to take a stand, starting a petition – \\"Bring our boys back home\\" – to gather support for their friends. Step 1: Describe the event and the background of the asylum-seeking boys. Two 16-year-old asylum-seekers were unexpectedly removed from their homes at night, causing distress and concern within their local community. The boys had been living in the area as they awaited a decision on their asylum cases, seeking refuge from their precarious past in their home countries. Step 2: Describe why authorities took this action. The authorities have claimed that it was not in the 'public interest' for the two teenagers to reside within the community. However, this decision has sparked uproar among friends, schoolmates, and staff who know these boys personally. Step 3: Discuss the boys' positive attributes, as shared by their principal. The school's principal described the two asylum-seeking students as 'intelligent' and 'incredibly loyal' members of their community. They were known to be diligent in pursuing their education and contributed positively to the life of the school. Step 4: Highlight the community's response to the situation. Outraged by this abrupt action against their friends, the boys' schoolmates have banded together to initiate a petition titled, \\"Bring our boys back home.\\" The petition aims to demonstrate support for the well-being of these young people, urging the relevant authorities to reconsider their decision and return the students to their community. Step 5: Discuss the potential wider implications of this case. This case highlights the ongoing challenges faced by asylum seekers, even in parts of the world where they seek protection and opportunity. The upheaval endured by these two young boys raises pertinent questions about the treatment and rights afforded to vulnerable persons in such situations. Conclusion: The removal of the two 16-year-old asylum seekers from their homes has triggered a wave of support from their community, particularly their schoolmates who have started a petition to advocate for their return. Impassioned by the sense of injustice and concern for the welfare of their friends, the community remains dedicated to ensuring that these boys are not forgotten and that their rights are upheld. The hope is that, through their collective efforts, these young people will be reunited with their supportive community and given the chance to continue pursuing a brighter future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is named for one of the newcomers? , can you please find it?   Before settlers moved into the basin, it consisted mainly of upland and wetland forests in which Native Americans fished, hunted, and foraged. Evidence suggests that people lived in the northern Oregon Cascade Range as early as 10,000 years ago. By 2,000 to 3,000 years ago, settlements in the Clackamas River basin, adjacent to the Johnson Creek watershed, had moved to the river's lower floodplain. The area was the home of the Clackamas Indians, a subgroup of the Chinookan speakers who lived in the Columbia River Valley from Celilo Falls to the Pacific Ocean. The Clackamas lands included the lower Willamette River from Willamette Falls at what became Oregon City to its confluence with the Columbia River and reached into the foothills of the Cascades. When Lewis and Clark visited the area in 1806, the Clackamas tribe consisted of about 1,800 people living in 11 villages. Epidemics of smallpox, malaria, and measles reduced this population to 88 by 1851, and in 1855 the tribe signed a treaty surrendering its lands, including Johnson Creek.By the middle of the 19th century, the European American newcomers had begun to remove vegetation, build sawmills, fell trees, fill wetlands, and farm in the fertile soil along Johnson Creek. The creek is named for one of these newcomers, William Johnson, who in 1846 settled in what later became the Lents neighborhood of Portland and operated a water-powered sawmill. In early 1848 Lot Whitcomb, who would later found Milwaukie, filed a donation land claim and built a sawmill near the confluence of Johnson Creek and the Willamette River. In 1886, plans were made for train tracks along the creek. In 1903, the Springwater Division Line, also known as the Portland Traction Company Line, the Cazadero Line, and the Bellrose Line, was built along Johnson Creek to provide rail transport for passengers and freight. Sellwood, Eastmoreland, Lents, and Pleasant Valley were among the new communities that grew up along the line. By the 1920s, housing began to replace creekside farms.","output":"Johnson Creek, located in the basin that was once the home to the Clackamas Indians, is named after one of the newcomers, William Johnson. William Johnson was a European American settler who arrived in the mid-19th century. Along with others, he began to alter the landscape by removing vegetation, felling trees, filling wetlands, and establishing farms along the creek. He settled in what later became the Lents neighborhood of Portland in the year 1846 and ran a water-powered sawmill. Consequently, the creek was named in his honor. This creek and its surrounding developments also served as the foundation for emerging communities like Sellwood, Eastmoreland, Lents, and Pleasant Valley which took form along a transportation line built in the area in 1903."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What were the two structures built by Dodson? ?  Ricketts Glen State Park is in five townships in three counties. After the 1768 purchase, the land became part of Northumberland County, but was soon divided among other counties. Most of the park is in Luzerne County, which was formed in 1786 from part of Northumberland County. Within Luzerne County, the majority of the park, including all of the waterfalls and most of Lake Jean, is in Fairmount Township, which was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1834; the easternmost part of the park is in Ross Township, which was settled in 1795 and incorporated in 1842. The northwest part of the park is in Sullivan County, which was formed in 1847 from Lycoming County; Davidson Township was settled by 1808 and incorporated in 1833, while Colley Township, which has the park office and part of Lake Jean, was settled in the early 19th century and incorporated in 1849. A small part of the southwest part of the park is in Sugarloaf Township in Columbia County; the township was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1812, the next year Columbia County was formed from Northumberland County.A hunter named Robinson was the first inhabitant in the area whose name is known; around 1800 he had a cabin on the shores of Long Pond (now called Lake Ganoga), which is less than 0.4 miles (0.6 km) northwest of the park. The first development within the park was the construction of the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike, which was built from 1822 to 1827 between the Pennsylvania communities of Berwick in the south and Towanda in the north. The turnpike, which Pennsylvania Route 487 mostly follows through the park, had daily stagecoach service from 1827 to 1851; the northbound stagecoach left Berwick in the morning and stopped for lunch at the Long Pond Tavern on the lake about noon.The earliest settlers in what became the park were two squatters who built sawmills to make bed frames from cherry trees they cut for lumber.

It is also clear that the St Kildans were not so naïve as they sometimes appeared. \\"For example, when they boarded a yacht they would pretend they thought all the polished brass was gold, and that the owner must be enormously wealthy\\". The boats brought other previously unknown diseases, especially tetanus infantum, which resulted in infant mortality rates as high as 80 percent during the late 19th century. The cnatan na gall or boat-cough, an illness that struck after the arrival of a ship off Hirta, became a regular feature of life.By the early 20th century, formal schooling had again become a feature of the islands, and in 1906 the church was extended to make a schoolhouse. The children all now learned English and their native Scottish Gaelic. Improved midwifery skills, denied to the island by John Mackay, reduced the problems of childhood tetanus. From the 1880s, trawlers fishing the north Atlantic made regular visits, bringing additional trade. Talk of an evacuation occurred in 1875 during MacKay's time as minister, but despite occasional food shortages and a flu epidemic in 1913, the population was stable at between 75 and 80, and no obvious sign existed that within a few years the millennia-old occupation of the island was to end.

The wrong Republican to pick a fight with Facebook Thune is chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee – which, among other jurisdictions, oversees technology, communications and Internet issues. “If true, these allegations compromise Facebook’s ‘open culture’ and mission ‘to make the world more open and connected,’” Thune wrote Tuesday in a sharply worded letter to Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, demanding that employees responsible for Trending Topics brief the Senate committee by May 24. That’s not a bad line, but given the circumstances, the Senate GOP’s bizarre sense of priorities is the least of the troubles here. Right off the bat, it’s difficult to understand how Congress has any oversight responsibilities towards a private social-media company. I haven’t the foggiest idea if Facebook puts its thumb on the scales to help the left with Trending Topics – the evidence is thin, at best, based on the word of anonymous contractors – but let’s say for the sake of conversation that the allegations are 100% accurate. Then what? How, exactly, would federal lawmakers justify intervening in Facebook’s ideological practices? Indeed, since when does the Senate care about media companies that may or may not have political preferences? John Thune says he’s concerned about Facebook’s “culture” and the integrity of its mission statement, but again, how in the world is that any of his business? Isn’t the Republican model based on the idea that the free market should decide and if online consumers don’t like Facebook’s “culture,” we can take our clicks elsewhere? He added, “Giving power to a few to regulate fairness in the media is a recipe for disaster on the scale that George Orwell so aptly envisioned.” And yet, here we are, watching the exact same senator use his office to demand answers from a media company accused of being insufficiently “fair” towards conservative content.

This is requesting a singular answer on what might be considered the superior or most preferred street food that one can find in Bogotá, the capital city of Colombia. If you were to answer this question, you would likely highlight a single street food item that is really popular among locals and tourists in Bogotá, perhaps something like an arepa or an empanada which are well-known Colombian street foods. It assumes that there is a definitive 'best' street food in Bogotá that can be objectively determined, which might not always be the case as it can largely depend on individual tastes and preferences.  The second question, \\"What are some of the best street foods?\\" is generic in nature and does not specify a location. It asks for a list of top street foods from potentially anywhere in the world. This could include hot dogs from New York, pad thai from Bangkok, falafels from the streets of Jerusalem, tacos from Mexico City, and so on. The question is not specific to Bogotá, Colombia, or any other location. The answer would offer a wider view of culinary delights from different countries and cultures, and might characterize 'best' as widely recognized, popular, or even emblematic street foods from all corners of the world. Both questions are about ranking street food, but the scope and spatial context of each question are quite different.

Waffle House Is Winning the World Cup on Twitter, One Typo at a Time From the moment the first World Cup match kicked off last month, brands have been vying for any and all opportunities to turn the soccer games into a real-time marketing moment. The news that the U.S. team would play Belgium pretty much served that opportunity to Waffle House on a platter. On Monday, the U.S. waffle chain decided to show support for its home country ahead of Tuesday's match against Belgium with a so-called \\"boycott\\" of Belgian waffles. A tweet announcing their war against Belgian waffles has since been retweeted nearly 15,000 times. We don't believe in Belgium waffles — Waffle House (@WaffleHouse) June 30, 2014 Unlike other brands on Twitter, Waffle House didn't dress up its tweet with a photoshopped image, insert ample amounts of branding or link to something on its website. Waffle House didn't even proofread it. (As Twitter users quickly pointed out, it should say \\"Belgian,\\" not \\"Belgium.\\") The mastermind behind that tweet is Meghan Irwin, who joined Waffle House in early 2012 as a communication specialist and maintains its various social media accounts with the help of one other PR representative. Some might call her Waffle House's social media strategist, but as she made perfectly clear, Waffle House doesn't really have a social media strategy. \\"I think we like to keep things very organic,\\" Irwin told Mashable in an interview. \\"I think it takes away from our brand's personality if we try to put too much strategy or too much thought into something.\\" And so it was that Irwin awoke on Monday morning and decided to riff on the many \\"I believe\\" tweets around the games with one saying it does not, in fact, believe in Belgium/Belgian waffles. \\"It was how I was feeling yesterday morning,\\" she says of her thinking for the tweet. In truth, there was a little more to it than that. The idea for the tweet originated from a tweet directed at Waffle House asking its opinion on Belgian waffles after the U.S. officially advanced to play Belgium. We dominate them RT @GBHunting: . @WaffleHouse what's your opinion on Belgian waffles? — Waffle House (@WaffleHouse) June 26, 2014 Heading into the World Cup, Irwin says she simply wanted to use the Waffle House Twitter account to tweet about \\"supporting America\\" and, of course, to raise awareness about Waffle House.

Bernard Mathew Leadon III (pronounced led-un; born July 19, 1947) is an American musician and songwriter, best known as a founding member of the Eagles. Prior to the Eagles, he was a member of three pioneering and highly influential country rock bands: Hearts & Flowers, Dillard & Clark, and the Flying Burrito Brothers. He is a multi-instrumentalist (guitar, banjo, mandolin, steel guitar, dobro) coming from a bluegrass background. He introduced elements of this music to a mainstream audience during his tenure with the Eagles. Leadon was born in Minneapolis, one of ten siblings, to Dr. Bernard Leadon Jr. and Ann Teresa (nee Sweetser) Leadon, devout Roman Catholics. His father was an aerospace engineer and nuclear physicist whose career moved the family around the U.S. The family enjoyed music and, at an early age, Bernie developed an interest in folk and bluegrass music. He eventually mastered the 5-string banjo, mandolin and acoustic guitar.  As a young teen he moved with his family to San Diego, where he met fellow musicians Ed Douglas and Larry Murray of the local bluegrass outfit, the Scottsville Squirrel Barkers. The Barkers proved a breeding ground for future California country rock talent, including shy, 18-year-old mandolin player Chris Hillman, with whom Leadon maintained a lifelong friendship. Augmented by banjo player (and future Flying Burrito Brother) Kenny Wertz, the Squirrel Barkers eventually asked Leadon to join the group, upon Wertz's joining the Air Force in 1963.  His stint in the Scottsville Squirrel Barkers did not last long. In late 1963, his family once again relocated to Gainesville, Florida, when his father accepted a position as Professor of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Florida. Leadon attended Gainesville High School, where he met classmate and future Eagles lead guitarist Don Felder, whose band, the Continentals, had just lost guitarist Stephen Stills. Upon Leadon's joining the group, rechristened Maundy Quintet, they gigged locally, even sharing the bill with future Gainesville legend Tom Petty and his early band the Epics (a band that also included Bernie's brother, musician Tom Leadon).  A call from ex-Squirrel Barker Larry Murray in 1967, to join his fledgling psychedelic country-folk group, Hearts & Flowers, was enticing enough for Leadon to return to California, where he soon became involved with the burgeoning L.A. folk/country rock scene. Leadon recorded one album with the band, their second release Of Horses, Kids, and Forgotten Women for Capitol Records. The record was a local hit but failed to make much of a dent on the national album charts. Discouraged, the group disbanded the following year.

A: Choose your answer from: 1). mutations. 2). fertilization. 3). lesions. 4). meiosis. Answer:","output":"A: When a sperm penetrates the egg, it triggers the egg to complete meiosis. So, the correct answer is 4). meiosis. Meiosis is a specialized type of cell division that occurs in sexually reproducing organisms, during the production of sex cells or gametes (sperm and egg cells). It results in the formation of haploid cells that have half the number of chromosomes compared to the diploid cells in the organism's body. In the egg cell, meiosis starts during the female's embryonic development but stops at the Meiosis I stage (specifically the prophase I phase). The egg cell remains in this stage until the female reaches sexual maturity. It is only during ovulation that the egg cell resumes meiosis I, divides, and forms two daughter cells: a larger secondary oocyte and a small polar body. However, the secondary oocyte does not complete meiosis II unless it encounters a sperm cell during fertilization. Upon sperm penetration, it triggers a series of biochemical events that make the egg re-enter the meiotic cell cycle, complete meiosis II, and divide into a mature ovum and another polar body. The successful completion of meiosis due to sperm penetration gives the fertilized egg, now called a zygote, a full set of chromosomes – half from the mother and half from the father. This is essential for proper embryonic development and the formation of a genetically unique offspring. In conclusion, sperm penetration triggers the egg to complete meiosis, which allows the formation of a diploid zygote and the initiation of embryonic development, leading to the birth of a new organism."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Played under cloudy skies, the game was also notable in that the weather conditions heralded the approach of Hurricane Sandy, a storm set to make an unprecedented landfall in nearby New Jersey.  In the first quarter, the Falcons drew first blood as Matt Ryan found Drew Davis for a 15-yard pass to make the score 7-0.  The team increased their lead with Ryan finding Jason Snelling to make it 14-0.  In the 2nd quarter, the Eagles would get on the board with LeSean McCoy's 2-Yard run to make it 14-7.  However, the Falcons responded with Ryan's 63-yard TD pass to Julio Jones to make it 21-7.  The Falcon would increase their lead before halftime with Matt Bryant's 43-yard field goal to make it 24-7.  The Eagles would try to rally in the 3rd quarter with a 33-yard field goal from Alex Henry to shorten the lead to 24-10, but the Falcons pulled away as Bryant would kick a 29-yard field goal to make it 27-10.  In the 4th quarter, Bryant increased the Falcons' lead with a 30-yard field goal to make the score 30-10.  The Eagles tried to rally as Michael Vick found McCoy to make the score 30-17.

The beach, naturally. There are hundreds of miles of beaches on the twenty islands of Hawaii. These islands cover 1,600 miles and are about 2,300 miles west of California. Most of them are covered with fine white sand. They are thought to be among the finest beaches in the world. Another wonderful thing about the beaches of Hawaii is the water temperature. The year-round average  temperature of the water at the famous Waikiki Beach is 230C! The same is true of air temperature. In fact, there are no real seasons in Hawaii. There is a difference of only two or three degrees between the hottest day of summer and the coldest day of winter. That's why the Hawaiians don't have a word for weather in their language. Perhaps the nicest thing about Hawaiian beaches are the waves. The earliest settlers   in Hawaii, the Polynesians, quickly learned how much fun it was to ride the waves. They developed a sport which is now very popular on the islands called body surfing. You go out into the ocean, wait for a big wave to come towards you, jump on it, and ride it all the way to the beach. Now imagine once again that you are the first person ever to set foot in Hawaii. What do you think would be the second beautiful thing you would notice? Would it be those strange triangles   rising out of the water hundreds and hundreds of meters high? What are those beautiful things? They are volcanoes  , of course. These volcanoes are not just a part of the islands. They made the islands at first. Because of them the islands are still growing. The most famous volcano on Hawaii is Mauna Loa. It is the world's most active volcano. It has been erupting   for thousands of years. Even when it isn't erupting, smoke comes out of the earth from a thousand little holes. In 1950 Mauna Loa erupted for twenty-three days.

Write some highlights for the following article: By. Daily Mail Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 14:17 EST, 13 August 2012. |. UPDATED:. 15:15 EST, 13 August 2012. A bankrupt Pakistani man and his son managed to set up a business and cheat their local community out of almost £50,000 despite being in the UK illegally, a court heard. Siyed Asem, 58, and his son Syed Bukhari, 25, ran a corner shop and operated a Western Union money transfer service offering ‘excellent rates’ on transactions. But more than 20 customers who used the service to send money to India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, were left thousands of pounds out of pocket. Father and son partnership: Bankrupt Siyed Asem, left, and his son Syed Bukhari, right, together stole nearly £50,000 from their customers who had requested for the cash to be transferred to India. Jailing father and son for two years. each, Judge Jamie Tabor QC described their offences against their own. Asian community in Gloucester’s Barton area as ‘despicable.’ Judge. Tabor said it was ‘extraordinary’ that the men had been able to run a. shop and set up the money transfer business when they were both illegal. overstayers and Asem was bankrupt. Asem. came to the UK on a visitor’s permit eight years ago and never left. His son was in the UK on a student permit which would not allow him to. work or run a business. Gloucester crown court heard that the service operated legitimately at first but the pair soon started stealing the money - which amounted to a total of £48,206. One of their customers, retired Khadijabbi Mulla, lost £1,000 he requested to be transferred to India to pay for his operation there. Prosecutor Lisa Hennessy said: 'He was told it would take 8 weeks, which would take him close to the date of his operation. 'When he got to India he still had not received the promised PIN number to access his money. 'He. contacted a friend in Gloucester to ask him to complain and the message. he got back was that he would get a refund when he got back. Jailed: Siyed Asem and Syed Bukhari were sentenced to two years in prison at Gloucester Crown Court. 'He has never received a refund - as he puts it he has just had lots of excuses and delays.' Mrs Hennessy said another victim of the con, Fatima Kazi, paid the men £1,500 to be transferred to India to help fund the building of a mosque in her late father’s memory. Mrs Hennessy continued: 'The money never arrived.' She detailed how other customers lost money in similar transactions - Runara Begum and her husband lost almost £5,500 which was supposed to be going to Bangladesh; Rashid Salloo lost £1,000 destined for India; Yusuf Chand transferred £7,000 to India in two transactions but it never arrived. There were other customers who had transferred significant sums and either received nothing or were given very small refunds, she added. Mrs Hennessy said all the offences occurred within a few months between late 2010 and early 2011 after Bukhari applied in October 2010 to become an agent for Finit UK, a Western Union money transfer company. The application was granted and he was approved after ‘various checks had been carried out’. Mrs Hennessy told the court the fact that both men were illegal immigrants didn't appear to 'have come up on the checks'. She added that they also failed to notice that Asem had been made bankrupt in 2008. Fraud: The pair set up a Western Union money transfer service but stole thousands of pounds from customers that was meant to be sent to India. Bukhari admitted 11 offences of fraud - of masking false representations to customers that his money transfer business was in a sound financial position and that money would be transferred at a preferential rate of exchange - between January and March 2011. Asem admitted 12 similar charges. Mrs Hennessy said Bukhari was responsible for £33,688 of the total fraud and Asem £14,518. Sabhia Pathan, defending, said Bukhari had come to Britain legitimately to study to be a chartered accountant but had started working at McDonald’s to earn some money and then had opened the shop with his father. Asem had trusted his son’s business acumen and joined him in the venture but the money transfer service had quickly gone wrong because they were offering such good exchange rates that they made no profit, she said. Ms Pathan said that Western Union had checked only Bukhari’s credit rating before allowing him to set up the service. She added that both men knew they were facing deportation after their sentences and Asem was fearful of going back to Pakistan because he has health problems which are better treated here. Despite his status he has been getting free medication, she said. Jailing the men, Judge Tabor said: 'Over a period of three months you stole just under £50,000 from many members of your local community. 'That money was entrusted to you to transfer abroad for a variety of purposes including allowing people to have operations and to help with a mosque and other charitable tasks. 'People trusted you, especially you, father, because of the seniority that you held. I accept that when you started this business in November you ran it legitimately for a short period of time. 'But by the middle of January you were nothing more or less than confidence tricksters. You have done considerable damage to your community and you know it. 'These were despicable offences.' He told them police will now investigate their finances to see what can be confiscated from them under the Proceeds of Crime Act. Highlights:","output":"1.

Additionally, the reviewer questions whether this movie was a model for \\"The Talented Mister Ripley\\" and if there is any affinity between Jean Seberg and Matt Damon. This questioning could indicate that the reviewer is trying to understand the connection between two seemingly unrelated movies, further demonstrating their perplexity at the movie under review.

The article below was originally published at Time.com The price of gas is plummeting like a bungee jumper without a rope. A majority of Americans are paying less than 2 per gallon for gas for the first time since 2009, and the ever-cheapening fuel it helping put more money in consumers’ pockets and bolster the economy. About 6 in 10 U.S. gas stations are selling a gallon of gas for under 2, according to AAA. The average gas price has dropped for a record 120 consecutive days to less than 2.04 a gallon. That’s the cheapest average in nearly six years. American consumers will benefit immensely this year from the drop: The Department of Energy predicted last week that the average American household would spend about 750 less for gasoline in 2015 compared with last year. “It’s crazy,” Michael Noel, an economics professor at Texas Tech University who studies oil and gasoline prices, told the Associated Press of the fuel price drop. “But for consumers it’s very, very good.” Lower fuel prices will also likely help the U.S. economy grow significantly this year. The World Bank expects the American economy to grow 3.2% this year, compared with 2.4% in 2014, and some forecasts are even higher. The downside? Oil drillers and refineries in states like Texas and North Dakota are likely to suffer from lower gas prices. Layoffs of thousands of workers have begun in recent weeks.

Mr Serwotka added: \\"This political and economic vandalism is even more stark and outrageous when, even by the department's own modest estimate, tens of billions of pounds is lost to our public finances every year, largely through tax evasion and avoidance.\\" HMRC said the move comes as part of plans to reduce its size and work from fewer locations.

Question: Given the background: The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency.  and the situation: Matt and his brother Jesse are twins. They look almost identical. If it weren't for the fact that Jesse has a slightly darker skin complexion you wouldn't be able to tell them apart. In fact one year Matt was out in the sun for a long time and picked up a bit of a tan so they actually did look exactly alike.  Answer the following question: Which persons melanocytes produce more melanin, Matt or Jesse? Answer:","output":"Jesse's melanocytes produce more melanin. Justification: From the background information, it's mentioned that \\"the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin\\". So applying this knowledge to the situation, it's known that Jesse has slightly darker skin complexion compared to Matt. It means Jesse's melanocytes produce more melanin than Matt's. The temporary tan Matt got from sun exposure doesn't permanently impact the melanin production, as it's stated that melanin production is largely influenced by heredity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

One such company, the iconic British brand Littlewoods, has done just that: it has evolved from its traditional mail-order catalogue origins into a thriving online retail business. The digital transformation has allowed Littlewoods to leave behind \\"the shackles of the catalogue\\" and flourish in the era of e-commerce. One significant contributing factor to the brand's success is the growing trend in mobile shopping. In this article, we will explore how this shift benefits Littlewoods and the broader retail landscape. The Move to Online Shopping For decades, Littlewoods was known for its large mail-order catalogues that allowed customers to browse through endless pages of products from the comfort of their own homes. However, the advent of the internet and the increasing dominance of e-commerce have led to a steady decline in catalogue-based sales. Recognizing the need to adapt, Littlewoods made a strategic decision to focus on online sales and retire their catalogues altogether in 2015. The transition was not without challenges. It required significant investments in technology infrastructure, staff training, and a robust online presence. However, the efforts have paid off: Littlewoods has established itself as a strong player in the world of online retail. The Importance of Mobile Phones in Online Shopping The ever-increasing prevalence of smartphones in our daily lives has undoubtedly been a major driver of Littlewoods' success. The mobile shopping experience has become increasingly smooth and user-friendly, motivating more and more people to shop online using their mobile devices. According to recent studies, mobile commerce (often referred to as m-commerce) is the fastest-growing segment in the retail industry. It has been estimated that mobile sales will comprise more than half of all e-commerce transactions by 2021. This shift means that retailers cannot ignore the importance of mobile devices as a key channel for their online sales. How Littlewoods Benefits from Mobile Shopping Littlewoods has capitalized on the mobile shopping trend by offering a seamless shopping experience across multiple devices. Their mobile e-commerce platform is designed to offer an intuitive interface that makes it easy for customers to browse, search, and complete purchases on the go. In addition to providing a robust website for online shopping, the company has also developed the Littlewoods smartphone app. Available for both iOS and Android devices, the app provides users with access to exclusive offers, personalized recommendations, and real-time order tracking. The app has proven popular among customers, with high engagement and retention rates. Its success demonstrates the benefits of focusing on the mobile aspect of e-commerce for retailers. Conclusion The digital transformation of Littlewoods showcases the potential for traditional retailers to adapt and thrive in the rapidly evolving world of e-commerce. The company's focus on mobile shopping has proven to be a key driver of their online success. As mobile commerce continues to grow and reshape the retail landscape, businesses like Littlewoods that embrace these changes and adopt customer-friendly strategies will be well-positioned to maximize their potential in the modern retail environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which Renaissance dramatist co-wrote Anything for a Quiet Life with John Webster? A:","output":"The Renaissance dramatist who co-wrote \\"Anything for a Quiet Life\\" with John Webster is Thomas Middleton. Thomas Middleton was a prolific English playwright and poet during the Jacobean and Caroline eras, known for his tragicomedies, satires, and city comedies. He collaborated with many other playwrights of the time, including William Rowley and John Webster. \\"Anything for a Quiet Life\\" is classified as a city comedy, which was a popular genre in early 17th century English drama. City comedies typically satirized the lives of the emerging urban middle class, highlighting their social ambitions and moral shortcomings. The themes of such plays often revolved around marriage, social status, and the pursuit of wealth. \\"Anything for a Quiet Life\\" was probably written around 1621, a collaborative work between two important playwrights of the time, Thomas Middleton and John Webster, who both had established reputations in the world of English Renaissance drama. While Middleton was known for his unique wit, dark humor, and keen observations of social and political issues, Webster's plays tended to have a macabre, poetic atmosphere, exemplified in his famous tragedies \\"The Duchess of Malfi\\" and \\"The White Devil.\\" In \\"Anything for a Quiet Life,\\" the plot revolves around the struggles of an aging, miserly citizen and his young wife, who is in love with another man. The play blends the elements of comedy and satire to explore the themes of lust, covetousness, and social intrigues, which were all characteristics of both the city comedy genre and Middleton's and Webster's distinct styles. It's important to note that collaboration between playwrights was common during the English Renaissance era, with many writers coming together to share their skills and ideas. This practice represents not only the collaborative nature of the theater but also the strong presence of a community of artists during the Renaissance period. In the case of Middleton and Webster, their joint work, \\"Anything for a Quiet Life,\\" is an example of two creative minds coming together to produce a unique and entertaining piece of drama that explores the complexities of human relationships and the social issues of their time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Under a deal with General Electric 's NBC , Vivendi 's film and TV business would merge with NBC 's broadcast network , Spanish- language network and cable channels including CNBC and Bravo .","output":"To determine if the two sentences have the same meaning, I will analyze and compare both sentences step by step: Step 1: Identify the subject and key components in both sentences. Sentence 1: Subject: NBC proposal Key components: Vivendi would merge its U.S. film and TV business with NBC's networks and channels. Sentence 2: Subject: deal with General Electric's NBC Key components: Vivendi's film and TV business would merge with NBC's networks and channels. Step 2: Determine if the subject and key components have the same meaning. In Sentence 1, the subject is an NBC proposal, and in Sentence 2, the subject is a deal with General Electric's NBC. While they are not word-for-word the same, both subjects refer to a possible business agreement between NBC and Vivendi. So, the subjects convey the same meaning. Step 3: Determine if the key components have the same meaning. In both sentences, the key component is that Vivendi would be merging its film and TV business with NBC's broadcast network, Spanish-language network, and cable channels including CNBC and Bravo. This component is the same in both sentences. Conclusion: The two sentences convey the same meaning, as they both describe a possible business agreement between NBC and Vivendi involving the merging of their respective film and TV businesses.

Answer the following question: President Donald Trump is counting on congressional Republicans to enact a package of tax cuts in the coming weeks, in the process delivering his first major legislative achievement since taking office in January. But even as Trump and his Republican allies close in on the goal of passing tax reform, the Russia investigation continues to be a major distraction. The recent plea deal between Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed. Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. “I will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,” Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. “There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.” Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. “It rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,” warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump’s base is largely sticking with him. The latest American Values Survey by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 84 percent of Republicans continue to back the president.

The first book, \\"Doctor Syn: A Tale of the Romney Marsh\\" was published in 1915. The story idea came from smuggling in the 18th century Romney Marsh, where brandy and tobacco were brought in at night by boat from France to avoid high tax. Minor battles were fought, sometimes at night, between gangs of smugglers, such as the Hawkhurst Gang and the Revenue, supported by the army and local militias in the South, Kent and the West, Sussex.  - Kent is a county in South East England and one of the home counties. It borders Greater London to the north west, Surrey to the west, East Sussex to the south west, and Essex across the Thames Estuary to the north. The county town is Maidstone.   - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.  - Arthur Russell Thorndike (6 February 1885, Rochester, Kent  7 November 1972) was a British actor and novelist, best known for the Doctor Syn of Romney Marsh novels. Less well-known than his sister Sybil but equally versatile, Russell Thorndike's first love was writing and, after serving in World War I, he devoted himself to it.  - The Hawkhurst Gang was a notorious criminal organisation involved in smuggling throughout southeast England from 1735 until 1749. One of the more infamous gangs of the early 18th century, they extended their influence from Dorset, where they successfully raided the customs house at Poole, to the Kent coast. After they were defeated in a battle with the Goudhurst militia in 1747, two of their leaders, Arthur Gray and Thomas Kingsmill, were executed in 1748 and 1749.  - Romney Marsh is a sparsely populated wetland area in the counties of Kent and East Sussex in the south-east of England.

A:","output":"Others might feel a variety of emotions and reactions upon discovering the situation, depending on their relationships with Jesse and the event that took place last night. Here is a detailed breakdown of how different people might react: 1. Close friends and family members: These individuals might feel hurt or betrayed because they were not informed about the situation by Jesse. They might have expected Jesse to share important events and emotions with them and feel disappointed by the lack of communication. Close friends and family members may also be concerned about Jesse's well-being, wondering if something happened that prompted them to hide information. 2. Acquaintances and coworkers: People who are not close to Jesse but interact with them regularly could have mixed reactions. Some may be indifferent, while others might be curious about the situation, especially if it has repercussions or affects their relationships with each other. Some coworkers may feel slightly offended or left out if they were present during the event or if it directly impacted their job environment. 3. Community members or strangers: These people might not have a personal connection to Jesse, but they might still react to the situation if it somehow affects them or their environments. For example, if the event took place in a public place or had any legal or social implications, community members might feel concerned, upset, or even outraged, depending on how the news spreads. 4. Jesse's rivals or adversaries: Individuals who have a contentious relationship with Jesse or who do not get along with them might react with satisfaction or smugness that they found out about the undisclosed event. They might use this information as leverage, gossip, or a means to tarnish Jesse's reputation. 5. Sympathetic or empathetic individuals: Some people might feel empathy and understanding for Jesse's choice not to share information about the event. They might recognize that Jesse could be going through a difficult time or struggling with personal issues, and choose to be supportive instead of judgmental. In summary, people's reactions and feelings about the situation could vary depending on their relationships with Jesse, their personal values, and the exact nature of the undisclosed event. Their emotions could range from betrayal and disappointment to curiosity, sympathy, and understanding. It would be essential for Jesse to address these issues by opening up about the situation to those they feel comfortable with, apologizing for any hurt caused, and working to rebuild trust among supporters. Simultaneously, Jesse should prepare for potential backlash from rivals and adversaries who may use the situation against them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: This article: Since the abolition of bishops within the Scottish Church in 1689, ownership of the abandoned cathedral fell to the crown, but no attempt to halt the decline of the building took place. Acknowledging the necessity to stabilise the structure, the Elgin Town Council initiated the reconstruction of the perimeter wall in 1809 and cleared debris from the surrounding area in about 1815. The Lord Provost of Elgin petitioned the King's Remembrancer for assistance to build a new roof for the chapterhouse and in 1824, £121 was provided to the architect Robert Reid for its construction. Reid was significant in the development of a conservation policy for historical buildings in Scotland and was to become the first Head of the Scottish Office of Works (SOW) in 1827. It was probably during his tenure at the SOW that the supporting buttresses to the choir and transept walls were built.In 1824 John Shanks, an Elgin shoemaker and an important figure in the conservation of the cathedral, started his work. Sponsored by local gentleman Isaac Forsyth, Shanks cleared the grounds of centuries of rubbish dumping and rubble. Shanks was officially appointed the site's Keeper and Watchman in 1826. Although his work was highly valued at the time and brought the cathedral back into public focus, his unscientific clearance work may have resulted in much valuable evidence of the cathedral's history being lost. He died on 14 April 1841, aged 82. A fortnight later, the Inverness Courier published a commemorative piece on Shanks, calling him the \\"beadle or cicerone of Elgin Cathedral\\", and writing: Some minor works took place during the remainder of the 19th century and continued into the early 20th century. During the 1930s further maintenance work followed that included a new roof to protect the vaulted ceiling of the south choir aisle.

Korea Fresh from sinking a South Korean navy ship and taking the lives of 46 mostly young sailors, North Korean leader Kim Jong Il hopped on his private armored train last week for a friendly visit to his enablers in Beijing. Is that a harsh interpretation of events? Yes; nuances and caveats to follow. But it's also an interpretation that best fits the available facts -- and it raises questions about the Obama administration's enduring hope (like the hope of the Bush administration before it) for China's help in constraining not only North Korea but also Iran and other bad actors around the world. The South Korean corvette Cheonan exploded, broke in two and sank off the west coast of Korea in darkness March 26, with 46 of the crew of 104 killed or lost at sea. Officially, the cause of the explosion remains under investigation, and South Korean President Lee Myung Bak has lodged no accusations. But the two pieces of the boat have been salvaged, internal explosions have been ruled out as cause and -- last week -- South Korean newspapers reported that traces of a torpedo had been found. The list of logical suspects extends from A to A. Lee, contending with popular anger among South Koreans, has labored methodically to lay the groundwork for a multilateral response focused on diplomatic or economic sanctions; military retaliation would only risk wider war. To that end, he discussed the sinking with Chinese President Hu Jintao in Shanghai on April 30. South Korean officials hoped that China would help send a message to its ally in Pyongyang that ship-sinking is not an approved sport among civilized nations. Instead, three days later, and without notification to South Korea, China rolled out the red carpet for North Korea's self-titled Dear Leader. The Chinese press was not permitted to report on the four-day visit as it took place or even acknowledge that it was happening. But after Kim was safely home, the Chinese news agency Xinhua reported that Hu had hosted a welcoming banquet in the Dear Leader's honor. \\"Hu said the traditional friendship between China and the DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] is the common treasure of the two governments, parties and peoples,\\" Xinhua reported. What to make of this? Analysts who believe that China wields a moderating, useful influence over North Korea found comfort in a five-point proposal that Hu issued. It called, for example, for the two countries \\"to strengthen coordination in international and regional affairs\\"; perhaps that signaled China's discontent that Pyongyang was sinking ships in the neighborhood without warning. According to the South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo, Kim unexpectedly departed Beijing before using his coveted ticket to the North Korean version of the Chinese classic opera \\"Dream of the Red Mansion\\"; maybe he left in a huff after Chinese officials had (perhaps) expressed reservations about ship-sinking. On the other hand, Chosun Ilbo also reported that Kim returned home with promises of 100,000 tons of food and 100 million in other aid from China for the crippled North Korean economy. And that reflects China's true role in North Korea. Despite all the time spent in six-party talks in recent years, and all the discussion of China's new role as a \\"responsible stakeholder\\" and a \\"strategic partner,\\" its main accomplishment has been to keep Kim Jong Il's murderous regime sputtering along. It does this by sending North Korean refugees who make it across the Yalu River back to North Korea, often to be executed, which tends to discourage the outward flow that would otherwise take place. And in periods when the United States, South Korea and Japan restrict their aid to North Korea for political reasons, China fills the gap. The regime's nuclear program has not been restrained; it is likely to face no serious consequences for its sinking of the Cheonan. All of this matters greatly to the 24 million or so people who remain imprisoned inside Kim's gulag nation. How much it matters to South Korea and its allies, including America, is debatable, since in one sense South Korea already has won the war. Its economy has grown to about 28,000 per person in purchasing power, according to the CIA World Factbook, not far behind Japan's; the CIA estimates the North Korean economy at 1,900 per person, which seems generous when stacked against accounts of refugees who have escaped. But it may matter more as an indication of how much help President Obama can expect from Hu and his colleagues. For a U.S. government hoping that China would rein in North Korea's nuclear program and back sanctions strong enough to influence Iran's behavior, Hu's post-Cheonan embrace of the Dear Leader must be a little dispiriting. What was this article about?","output":"This article discusses the troubling friendship between China and North Korea, specifically in the context of North Korea's alleged sinking of a South Korean navy ship in 2010, which resulted in the death of 46 sailors. Following the incident, North Korean leader Kim Jong Il visited Beijing, where he received a warm welcome from Chinese President Hu Jintao despite the ongoing investigation and South Korea's push for a multilateral response. The article highlights the challenges this relationship poses for the Obama administration, as it hoped for China's assistance in constraining not only North Korea but also Iran and other problematic global actors. While some analysts argue that China wields a moderating influence over North Korea, the facts on the ground, including China sending aid to support the struggling North Korean economy, tell a different story. The article concludes that China's actions may be indicative of the level of help the United States can expect when seeking cooperation on issues related to North Korea, and potentially other regional security matters such as Iran."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Half of the world's population is affected by Asian monsoons , but monsoons are difficult to predict. American researchers have put together a 700-year record of the rainy seasons, which is expected to provide guidance for experts making weather predictions. Every year, damp air masses,known as monsoon,produce large amounts of rainfall in India, East Asia, Northern Australia and East Africa. All this wet air is pulled in by a high pressure area over the Indian Ocean and a low pressure area to the south. According to Edward Cook , a weather expert at Columbia University in New York., the complex nature of the climate systems across Asia makes monsoons hard to predict. In addition, climate records for the area are too recent and not detailed enough to be of much use. Therefore, he and a team of researchers spent more than fifteen years traveling across Asia, looking for trees old enough to provide long-term records. They measured the rings, or circles, inside thousands of ancient trees in more than 300 places. Rainfall has a direct link to the growth and width of rings on some kinds of trees. The researchers developed a document they are calling a Monsoon Asia Drought Atlas. It shows the effect of monsoons over seven centuries, beginning in the 1300s. Professor Cook says the tree-ring records show periods of wet and dry weather. \\"If the monsoon basically fails or is a very weak one, the trees affected by monsoons at that location might put on a very narrow ring. But if the monsoon is very strong, the trees affected by that monsoon might put on a wide ring for that year. So, the wide and narrow ring widths of the chronology that we developed in Asia provide us with a measure of monsoon variability.\\" With all this information, researchers say they can begin to improve computer climate models for predicting the behavior of monsoons. \\"There has been widespread famine and starvation and human dying in the past in large droughts. And on the other hand, if the monsoon is particularly heavy, it can cause extensive... Question: It is difficult for experts to predict Asian monsoons because   _  . - it is hard to keep long-term climate records. - they are formed under complex climate systems. - they influence many nations. - there is heavy rainfall in Asia.

Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal? Pick your answer from: (a). Use an old horse shoe, place the drink container in the place where your foot enters the shoe and it will help stabilize it.; (b). Use an old shoe, place the drink container in the place where your foot enters the shoe and it will help stabilize it.;...I think the answer is","output":"(b). Use an old shoe, place the drink container in the place where your foot enters the shoe and it will help stabilize it. When driving an older car without cupholders, finding a safe and secure spot for your beverage can be a challenge. Among the given options, using an old shoe to place your drink container is more reasonable than using a horseshoe. Here is a detailed explanation as to why this option is more practical: 1. Availability of materials: It is more likely that you have an old shoe readily available at home than an old horseshoe. Shoes are common household items, whereas horseshoes are not typically found in most homes, especially if you don't live on a farm or have horses. 2. Stability: An old shoe, with its larger surface area, will provide better support and more stability for your drink container when compared to a horseshoe. The shape and size of a shoe can engulf the container to a larger extent, providing a snug fit and minimizing the risk of spills. 3. Compatibility with various container sizes: Shoes, especially those with larger foot openings, can accommodate different sizes of drink containers, including cups, bottles, and cans. A horseshoe, on the other hand, has a rigid structure and may not be compatible with containers of various sizes. 4. Safety: Placing your drink container in an old shoe reduces the chances of it falling while driving, as the shoe provides cushioning and support around the container. A horseshoe, however, has a hard and potentially sharp structure that may cause damage to your car's interior or even pose a danger to the driver and passengers. 5. Convenience: It is much easier to pick up and set down your drink container from a shoe than from a horseshoe. A shoe provides a convenient and accessible makeshift cupholder, while a horseshoe might require more attention when placing and removing the drink, which can be distracting when driving. In summary, using an old shoe to hold your beverage while driving an older car without built-in cupholders is a more practical and reasonable option than using a horseshoe. This method provides better stability, convenience, and safety for both the driver and the passengers, while ensuring compatibility with various container sizes and making it easy to find an appropriate holder among everyday household items."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. My then-teenage daughter and I went to a new restaurant. It was empty apart from the manager. We were told to find ourselves a table, so we sat in an attractive area sort of like a small stage. No waitress came by for 10 minutes, so we decided to visit the restroom; there was just one, with one toilet. But a woman rushed in ahead of us, carrying a bundle of clothes. Several minutes later, when she reappeared, we realized this was our waitress—arriving late and pushing us customers out of the way so she could change. OK… We each used the restroom and returned to our table. But it was not our table anymore. Along came the manager to explain she needed to set aside the stage-like area for a very special group. My daughter and I had already been debating whether to stay or leave. We stayed only because we were very hungry and worried that we’d have to start waiting all over again if we tried a different place. We were led to our new table: a lonely little table in the hall leading to the toilet. I was ready to get out of there, pronto, but my daughter spotted her favorite meal on the menu.

Question 2: Is there a currently evolving tendency towards nasty, trashy behavior in sports? Possible answers:  (A). no.  (B). yes. Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"The answer to these two questions might not necessarily be the same, as they both tackle different topics and require separate evaluations. Let's analyze each question individually to better understand the issues at hand. Question 1: Is there a tendency to gravitate toward conspiracy theories on RT News? RT News, formerly known as Russia Today, is a Russian state-funded international television network. While it is important to note that not all content on RT News is conspiracy theories or misinformation, there have been instances where the network has promoted or given airtime to conspiracy theories. This has been especially prevalent in the context of global politics, where some argue that RT News spreads disinformation to further political agendas.  However, it is essential to recognize that this is a matter of interpretation and individual perception of the viewers. Some may view certain stories on RT News as conspiracy theory promotions, while others might see them as alternative viewpoints that challenge mainstream narratives. Overall, there is a possibility that RT News may lean towards promoting conspiracy theories, albeit not consistently in all their content. Question 2: Is there a currently evolving tendency towards nasty, trashy behavior in sports? Sports-related incidents that involve nasty or trashy behavior have occurred throughout history. Recently, however, the advent of social media and the widespread presence of cameras have led to a higher visibility of such incidents. Consequently, people may perceive an increased tendency of bad behavior in sports.  Moreover, the high levels of competition, financial stakes, and public pressure may contribute to athletes or teams occasionally engaging in unsportsmanlike behavior. Additionally, rivalries and long-standing feuds between teams, athletes, or fans can lead to incidents that are not reflective of the majority of sports interactions. In conclusion, while there may be no definitive yes or no answer to these questions, it is likely that RT News does have a tendency to gravitate towards conspiracy theories, whereas the apparent increase in nasty, trashy behavior in sports may be more of a side effect of increased visibility and specific incidents rather than an evolving trend.

A fascinating comparative analysis of Amish and Hutterite farming communities has finally uncovered the specific aspects of farm life that are responsible for this built-in immune protection.      In a new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers from the University of Chicago Medical Center and the University of Arizona have shown that substances found in house dust in Amish homes have a profound impact on the development of the body’s innate immune system in ways that protect children from asthma. Revealingly, the same could not be said for Hutterites, who share similar ancestry, lifestyles, and cultural values. But it’s the differences between these two farming communities that shed light on the reasons why.      “You can’t put a cow in every family’s house, but we may be able to protect children from asthma by finding a way to re-create the time-tested Amish experience.”      The American Amish and Hutterite communities were established by immigrants from Central Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries. Consequently, they provide an incredible opportunity for scientists to conduct comparative analyses; the Amish and Hutterites not only share genetic ancestry, they also share similar lifestyles and customs, such as a Germanic diet, having large families, breastfeeding, drinking raw milk, not allowing indoor pets, and favoring childhood vaccinations.            But these communities differ in one very important way: they engage in different farming practices. The Amish still cling to traditional methods, such as living on single-family dairy farms and relying on horses for fieldwork and transportation. The Hutterites, by contrast, live on large communal farms and use modern, industrialized farm machinery. As a result, Hutterite children aren’t exposed to farm animals to the same degree that Amish children are.            Advertisement      Over the years, researchers have noticed a disparity in the prevalence of asthma between the two groups. Around five percent of Amish children aged six to 14 have asthma, which is about half of the US average. By contrast, around 21 percent of Hutterite children have asthma. As study co-author Carole Ober put it in a press statement, that’s a “whopping discrepancy.”            To figure out what’s going on, the researchers studied 60 Amish and Hutterite children aged seven to 14. In addition to performing genetic analyses, the researchers compared the types of immune cells in their blood, collected dust from their homes, and measured the amount of microbes in the homes of both communities.      Advertisement      A key discovery was the presence of neutrophils among Amish children—blood cells that are crucial to fighting infections. They also found a lack of eosinophils among the Amish, which promote allergic reactions, such as inflammation. Genetic analysis also showed that Amish children have a more reactive immune system.      In a follow-up to these findings, immunologist Donata Vercelli exposed genetically modified mice to house dust extracted from the homes (these mice were engineered to have weakened immune responses). She found that the airways of mice exposed to Amish dust were protected from asthma-like responses to allergens. The same could not be said for mice exposed to Hutterite dust. The dust collected from Amish homes contained more microbes—6.8 times more to be precise.      “Neither the Amish nor the Hutterites have dirty homes,” explained Ober. “Both are tidy. The Amish barns, however, are much closer to their homes. Their children run in and out of them, often barefoot, all day long. There’s no obvious dirt in the Amish homes, no lapse of cleanliness. It’s just in the air, and in the dust.”      Advertisement      This study strongly suggests that early and frequent exposure to farming microbes, particular those that come from livestock, boosts Amish children’s disease-fighting immune system. The authors hope that these findings will point the way towards therapies or medicines that will help to prevent asthma and other allergies. As Ober put it, “You can’t put a cow in every family’s house, but we may be able to protect children from asthma by finding a way to re-create the time-tested Amish experience.”      [New England Journal of Medicine] ||||| One way to reduce children's rates of asthma may come from dairy farms, a new study finds. And not just any dairy farms — Amish dairy farms, to be exact.      Kids who grow up in Amish communities have much lower rates of asthma than the general population, potentially thanks to their exposure to the communities' dairy farms at an early age, according to the study, published today (Aug. 3) in the New England Journal of Medicine.      Indeed, exposure to an \\"Amish-like\\" environment appears to protect kids against asthma, said Carole Ober, a professor of human genetics at the University of Chicago and a co-author of the study. [9 Weirdest Allergies]      In the study, the researchers compared two relatively isolated farming communities: an Amish community in Indiana and a Hutterite community in South Dakota. The researchers wanted to compare these communities because the two groups have many similar cultural traditions, Ober said. For example, both groups shun television, radio and the internet; have large families; and breast-feed their children for a long time, she said. The two groups also eat similar diets, she said. However, there's a striking difference in the rate of asthma, which is much higher in Hutterite kids than in Amish children, she said.      The researchers looked at blood samples from 30 kids from ages 7 and 14 from the Amish community, and 30 kids of the same age range from the Hutterite community. In addition, the researchers collected a small amount of dust from 10 houses in each community.      The blood samples showed that the Amish kids had higher levels of immune cells that play a role in the body's \\"innate immune response.\\" This response is the most ancient part of the immune system, shared by all animals, Ober said. Because the scientists figured out that the innate immune system is likely involved in the differences between these two communities, the researchers can now focus more on figuring out which parts of the innate immune system may reduce a child's risk of asthma, Ober said.      The researchers also took the house dust that they collected and exposed mice to it. The animals that were exposed to the Amish house dust did not get asthma when they were later exposed to things that would normally trigger the condition, the researchers found. The Hutterite house-dust, on the other hand, did not have a protective effect.      This suggests something in the dust in Amish homes has a protective effect against asthma, Ober told Live Science. Moving forward, the researchers hope to figure out exactly what component of the dust is beneficial, she said. It's likely bacteria or fungi, she added, but it's unclear what types of bacteria or fungi, or what combinations of microbes.      The researchers think that the potentially beneficial bacteria or fungi in Amish house dust can probably be traced back to the Amish dairy farms, Ober said. In these communities, the families live much closer to dairy farms than kids in Hutterite communities do, and Amish children often start going into barns at a very young age, she said. This exposes the kids to animals and the microbes that often accompany them, according to the study. These microbes can make their way into house dust.      In Hutterite communities, on the other hand, the families live much farther from the farms, and kids don't come into contact with animals at a young age, Ober said.      The study illustrates what researchers call the hygiene hypothesis, Ober said. This idea proposes that in the past several decades or so, the environments that people live in have gotten much cleaner, but this cleanliness has had a negative impact on the human immune system, she said. As a result, people are now more susceptible to immune-related diseases such as asthma, she said.      One of the biggest changes related to cleanliness is the switch from farming communities to nonfarming communities, Ober said. Indeed, researchers in Germany have found that being exposed to things you would find on a farm — cows, in particular — may have a protective effect against certain diseases, Ober said. (Other research has shown that if families have a pet dog when their child is born, the child has a lower risk of asthma, she added.) [7 Surprising Benefits of Dog Ownership]      But for kids who don't grow up on dairy farms, the findings may still be relevant, she said.      \\"I keep saying if everyone would just put a cow in their house, no kid would have asthma, but that's not very practical,\\" Ober said. Instead, Ober said that she envisions an air mister that parents could use in a child's bedroom during their first year of life, that would spray the beneficial microbes into the air.      The age at which kids are exposed to the microbes is important, too, because the benefits seem to only take effect if a child is exposed as an infant, Ober said. In future studies, she would like to encourage Hutterites to get their babies to be around animals very early, and see if this reduces the children's risk of asthma, she said.

There are two dairy farms in the town of Milkton and both are about the same size. Farm A produces only organic milk. Farm B does not but they are considering switching production to organic milk.  Which farm likely has higher milk yields, farm A or B?  Hint: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally). A:","output":"To determine which farm is likely to have higher milk yields, let's evaluate the information given and analyze the differences in milk production between these two dairy farms: Farm A: Organic Milk Production 1. Reduces leaching of nitrates and phosphates due to lower fertilizer application rates 2. Increases land use per ton of milk produced due to reduced crop yields per hectare and consequently has lower milk production per cow 3. May have increased methane emissions due to increased roughage and lower milk production per cow Farm B: Conventional Milk Production 1. May have higher fertilizer application rates, resulting in more nitrate and phosphate leaching 2. May have higher crop yields per hectare, resulting in more efficient land use and higher milk production per cow 3. May have lower methane emissions due to higher milk production per cow Given this information, the likely answer would be that Farm B, with conventional milk production, has higher milk yields compared to Farm A, which is an organic dairy farm. This is mainly due to the higher crop yields per hectare and the presumably higher milk production per cow in conventional dairy farms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible A: building, canned goods, grocery store, church, department store  Why is \\"grocery store\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"\\"Grocery store\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it is the most contextually relevant and appropriate option among the given choices when considering the question about finding lettuce. Lettuce is a food item, specifically a type of leafy green vegetable that is commonly consumed in salads, sandwiches, and various other culinary preparations. Given its nature as a perishable food product, the most likely place one would find lettuce would be at a grocery store. Grocery stores are establishments that primarily sell food items, including fresh produce such as lettuce, fruits, and other vegetables, along with other essential goods like canned and packaged foods, beverages, and household supplies. The other provided options do not align with human common sense, as they either do not have any direct relationship to food items or are contextually irrelevant. For example: 1. Building - This is a very general term that refers to any type of structure made for human activities. It could include a grocery store but also encompasses numerous other structures that are not related to food shopping, making it too vague and nonspecific. 2. Canned goods - This refers to a category of food items that have been preserved and packaged in cans or jars for long-term storage. While lettuce can be found at a grocery store alongside canned goods, it is not a canned product. Lettuce is sold fresh, which distinguishes it from canned goods. 3. Church - A church is a place of worship for Christians and generally does not function as a marketplace for food items like lettuce. It is an irrelevant option when considering the context of the question. 4. Department store - Although some department stores may have grocery sections, they primarily focus on selling a wide variety of non-food items, including clothing, accessories, home goods, electronics, and more. As such, a department store is not the most appropriate answer when considering where to find lettuce, as they are not specifically designed for selling food items like a grocery store is. Based on these explanations, it is clear that \\"grocery store\\" is the answer most aligned with human common sense because it is the most contextually appropriate and relevant location where a person would logically expect to find lettuce for purchase. This choice takes into account the inherent qualities of lettuce as a food item and understands the nature of grocery stores as specialized establishments for buying food."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Combine like terms (-132*k and 90*k) by adding them together: -132*k + 90*k = (-132 + 90) * k = -42*k Now the equation looks like this: 93*k + 1350 = -42*k Step 2: Move all terms containing k to the left side of the equation.

The first recording of L'incoronazione, with Walter Goehr conducting the Tonhalle-Orchester Zürich in a live stage performance, was issued in 1954. This LP version, which won a Grand Prix du Disque in 1954, is the only recording of the opera that predates the revival of the piece that began with the 1962 Glyndebourne Festival production. In 1963 Herbert von Karajan and the Vienna Staatsoper issued a version described by Gramophone as \\"far from authentic\\", while the following year John Pritchard and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra recorded an abridged version using Leppard's Glyndebourne orchestration. Leppard conducted a Sadler's Wells production, which was broadcast by the BBC and recorded on 27 November 1971. This is the only recording of the opera in English.Nikolaus Harnoncourt's 1974 version, the first recording without cuts, used period instruments in an effort to achieve a more authentic sound, although Denis Arnold has criticised Harnoncourt's \\"over-ornamentation\\" of the score, particularly his use of oboe and trumpet flourishes. Arnold showed more enthusiasm for Alan Curtis's 1980 recording, live from La Fenice in Venice. Curtis uses a small band of strings, recorders and continuo, with a trumpets reserved for the final coronation scene. Subsequent recordings have tended to follow the path of authenticity, with versions from baroque specialists including Richard Hickox and the City of London Baroque Sinfonia (1988), René Jacobs and Concerto Vocale (1990), and John Eliot Gardiner with the English Baroque Soloists.

Write a title for this article: Nathaniel Brooks for The New York Times Gov. David A. Paterson, shown in June, testified that he did not recall a conversation soon after an alleged domestic assault. The report by Judith S. Kaye, the former chief judge of the New York State Court of Appeals, suggested that there was something of a river of leaks from the governor’s office, through his lawyers, to people who were drawn into the investigation of his role in an aide’s domestic violence case. Indicating embarrassment, Ms. Kaye wrote that her “investigators learned inadvertently” about the disclosures and asked that they stop, the report said. “It is unclear,” her report added, whether the information sharing did stop. The leaks, lawyers and others said, could have allowed witnesses who are subjects of the investigation to coordinate their defense and perhaps align their testimony. Ms. Kaye’s remarks about the administration’s conduct during the investigation drew the interest of lawyers and prosecutors Thursday, in part because they seemed to distract attention from the report’s main conclusion — that the governor did not commit a crime. In its final paragraphs, the report said the governor’s office “did not keep its public commitment to cooperate fully with the investigation,” though the report indicated that the sharing of the information did not violate any laws. The report indicated that Mr. Paterson’s counsel in the governor’s office, Peter J. Kiernan, gave information about the investigation to Theodore V. Wells Jr., Mr. Paterson’s personal criminal lawyer, and that the information then went on to other people. “This conduct raised concerns,” it said. In response to questions on Thursday, Mr. Wells issued a statement saying, “We believe that the governor cooperated fully with Judge Kaye’s investigation.” Mr. Wells’s statement said, “Judge Kaye’s staff has confirmed directly to us that her report did not intend to criticize my conduct.” Mr. Kiernan issued a statement saying there was “a good-faith disagreement between me and the independent counsel regarding the role of counsel’s office in representing the governor.” He said he stood by “the legality and propriety” of the handling of what he said were more than 100,000 documents, including audio tapes and phone logs. A spokeswoman for Mr. Paterson’s lawyers, Brandy Bergman, declined to comment when asked whether the governor had directed that information obtained from the investigators be shared with lawyers and witnesses. Among prosecutors and former prosecutors, the comments in Ms. Kaye’s report seemed to cloud the report’s ability to quiet the controversy surrounding Mr. Paterson’s role in the domestic violence case against his suspended aide, David W. Johnson. “She is at least implicitly, if not explicitly, stating that there is going to be uncertainty about her findings because of the possibility the investigation could have been affected by leaks,” said Daniel C. Richman, a former prosecutor who is a law professor at Columbia. Investigations are often kept confidential for many reasons, lawyers said, but they noted that even witnesses who testify in secret grand jury proceedings are permitted to share information with others about what they said. Information sharing can become illegal obstruction of justice when it is intended to interfere with proceedings. But several lawyers said that by labeling her complaint as one about poor cooperation, Ms. Kaye was indicating that the actions of the governor and his lawyers had not crossed the line into illegality. Still, lawyers said, the comments in the report showed frustration among the investigators. “Prosecutors are always concerned about information sharing,” said Nicolas Bourtin, a former federal prosecutor who is a defense lawyer at Sullivan & Cromwell. “It allows people to get their stories straight.” The report indicated that the information disclosed by the governor’s office could have provided clues about the direction of the investigation. It said the information included investigators’ requests for documents from the governor and the documents that were turned over. The information, the report said, also “included not only the governor’s files and communications but also those of staff members.” Much of the investigation focused on what Mr. Paterson knew, whom he talked to and when. The investigation was conducted under a provision requiring that in certain state investigations officials cannot disclose the names of witnesses “or any information obtained.” A violation is a misdemeanor. In its opening pages, Ms. Kaye’s report noted the provision “criminalizing disclosure of investigative information.” But as lawyers studied the provision on Thursday, many of them noted that its language made clear that Mr. Paterson could not have been prosecuted for violating it. The provision says a governor can direct the disclosure of investigative information. Lawyers said the provision was written to permit a governor to request attorney general investigations of possible official wrongdoing and then to use their findings as he chose. Mr. Paterson asked the attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, to investigate the claims concerning his involvement in Mr. Johnson’s case. Mr. Cuomo, a candidate for governor, then asked Ms. Kaye to run the investigation. The law permitting the investigations, several lawyers said, was not drafted with the idea that the governor might be the subject of an inquiry he requested. Lawyers for some of the people involved in the investigation denied that they had received information from the governors’ lawyers or declined to discuss the issue. Mr. Johnson’s lawyer, Oscar Michelen, said he would not confirm or deny that he had received information. But he said the investigators’ implication that information sharing was improper was wrong. “I think,” Mr. Michelen said, “the report shows that they’re not familiar with New York law in a couple of areas.”","output":"\\"Paterson's Office Leaks Undermine Confidence in Domestic Violence Case Investigation Outcome\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The more time he wants to spend with you, the more he cares. Allow some leeway if your schedules are busy or conflicting because of work, school, or family functions. But if he has all the free time in the world and only wants to see you once a week, consider that a sign of ambivalence. Note how frequently he calls, emails, or texts you. If he contacts you regularly, consider that a sign that he wants to be part of your life. Give him a little grace period if he’s extremely busy, but also note how much effort he makes to keep in touch in spite of that. On the other hand, watch out if he's calling way too much. If he calls you when he knows you're busy with work, family, or studying and still expects you to drop everything and talk to him, that probably means he cares less about your needs and more about his own. When you aren’t going to see each other anytime soon, ask him what he’ll be up to. Gauge his willingness to answer.

Write an article based on this \\"Obtain a long cardboard tube with one end closed. Flatten the tube along one edge. Bait the tube. Place the tube on the edge of a countertop or second story landing. Place a trash can beneath the tube. Check the trap frequently.\\"","output":"Title: A Simple, Eco-Friendly, DIY Pest Control Solution: How to Create a Cardboard Tube Trap Introduction With advancements in technology, pest control options have become more varied and complicated. Despite this, there are still straightforward, cost-effective, and practical solutions for dealing with unwanted pests. One such solution involves the use of a simple household item: the cardboard tube. Perfect for a more sustainable and ecological approach, the cardboard tube trap can help you eliminate pests with ease. This article will guide you step-by-step on how to build an effective and environmentally-friendly cardboard tube trap. Materials needed: 1. Long cardboard tube (with one end closed) 2. Bait (e.g., peanut butter, scraps of food, or any suitable attractant for the targeted pests) 3. Flattening tool (such as a rolling pin or a heavy book) 4. Countertop or second story landing 5. Trash can or other receptacle 6. Gloves (for safe handling and disposal) Procedure: 1. Obtain a long cardboard tube with one end closed: Cardboard tubes from used toilet paper rolls, paper towel rolls, or even gift wrapping rolls can be used for this purpose. The ideal length of the cardboard tube should be at least 6 inches. Choose a tube that has only one end closed. If both ends are open, simply fold and tape one end to close it. 2. Flatten the tube along one edge: Use a rolling pin, a heavy book, or any suitable flat item to press and flatten one edge of the cardboard tube. The objective is to create an opening that is less than half of the tube's diameter. This will allow pests to enter but not easily escape, thus trapping them inside the tube. 3. Bait the tube: Select a bait that is appropriate for the pests you intend to trap. For rodents like mice and rats, peanut butter or bread crumbs work great. Insects, such as ants, can be lured in with sugar or small bits of fruit. Insert the bait inside the tube, near the closed end, making sure it's secured in place. You can use a small piece of tape or a toothpick to hold the bait in position. 4. Place the tube on the edge of a countertop or second story landing: The ideal location for setting the trap depends on the type of pest you're dealing with. For rodents, position the tube on the edge of a countertop, table, or any elevated surface that these creatures frequent. In the case of insects, placing the tube close to their trails or entry points can be highly effective. 5. Position a trash can beneath the tube: Once the trap is set, place a trash can or any receptacle under the open end of the tube. The purpose of the trash can is to collect the pests that fall from the tube upon being trapped. 6. Check the trap frequently: It's crucial to monitor the trap often to ensure its effectiveness. If a caught pest is not removed promptly, it may attract other predators, or the pest may find a way to escape. Wear gloves when handling the trap and disposing of pests to avoid direct contact with the creatures and any potential pathogens they may carry.  Conclusion The cardboard tube trap offers an eco-friendly and cost-effective alternative for pest control. This user-friendly method requires minimal resources, making it accessible for anyone looking for a DIY solution. It can be especially helpful for those who wish to avoid using harsh chemicals and poisons in their homes. In addition to its environmental benefits, the cardboard tube trap can also be a fun and educational activity for families to learn about pest behavior and sustainable solutions. Just remember to always handle and dispose of trapped pests humanely, and take necessary precautions to protect yourself from potential harm."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1975 he returned to Odibo , and in 1977 to Windhoek .","output":"These two sentences from Wikipedia convey similar information but do not have the exact same meaning. The differences between the two sentences lie in the verbs used and the implications regarding the subject's relationship with the two places.  In the first sentence - \\"In 1975 he moved to Odibo, and in 1977 returned to Windhoek.\\" - the verb \\"moved\\" conveys that the subject relocated to Odibo in 1975. The use of \\"returned\\" in the second part of the sentence indicates that the subject had been to Windhoek before, and in 1977, they went back. By using \\"moved,\\" there isn't necessarily any previous connection implied between the subject and Odibo. In the second sentence - \\"In 1975 he returned to Odibo, and in 1977 to Windhoek.\\" - the verb \\"returned\\" is used in both instances, which implies that the subject had an earlier connection to both places. In 1975, they went back to Odibo, where they had spent time in the past; similarly, in 1977, they returned to Windhoek, another location with which they have a history. In summary, though these two sentences provide similar information about the subject's movement between Odibo and Windhoek, the use of verbs changes the meaning slightly, with the first sentence suggesting that the subject moved to Odibo for the first time while the second sentence implies they had a history in both locations before returning to them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Process:  - A photovoltaic cell is created with two layers of semiconductor material - The top layer are &#x27;doped&#x27; with impurities to allow a negative charge - The bottom layer are &#x27;doped&#x27; to allow for a positive charge - This produces an electric field that allows electrons to flow from negative to positve - Sunlight enters the cell - Energy from sunlight knocks electrons loose in both fields - This prevents the flow of electrons from negative to positive - Adding an external circuit allows the exchange to continue - Give the cells owner a flow of electricity.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less solar power being generated happens, how will it affect MORE solar power being generated.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis implies that there is a change or disturbance in the solar power generation system, in this case, a reduction in the amount of solar power being generated. This scenario can arise due to various factors such as weather conditions, dust on solar panels, or degradation of the photovoltaic cell's efficiency over time. The effect of this perturbation on generating more solar power can be analyzed through its direct and indirect impacts. Direct Effects: 1. Lower solar power output: A decrease in solar power generation can lead to a lower output of electricity. This means that the solar energy system may not be able to meet the energy requirements of the connected load or applications. 2. Reduced efficiency: The decrease in the performance of the photovoltaic cells directly impacts their efficiency. Lower efficiency reduces the overall productivity of the solar energy system, making it less competitive compared to other power generation methods. Indirect Effects: 1. Financial implications: With less solar power being generated, the return on investment (ROI) will be negatively affected. If electricity generation is significantly lower than expected, it could prolong the payback period and reduce the overall financial returns for the investment. 2. Grid dependency: If the solar power system is unable to generate sufficient electricity, users might have to rely more on the conventional electricity grid. This increased dependence on fossil-fuel-based power sources can contribute to greater greenhouse gas emissions and higher electricity costs. 3. Incentive and policy impacts: The reduction in solar power generation can influence government policies and incentives related to renewable energy. If solar power systems do not perform as expected, it may discourage further investments and installations in this sector, slowing the overall growth of solar energy adoption. To mitigate these effects, it is important to install and maintain solar power systems properly, monitor their performance regularly, and address any issues that could hinder their efficiency and electricity generation. This can help maximize the potential of solar power and contribute to a sustainable and greener future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Of course, it was easy enough to see in hindsight that \\"2dozjumHerbal Essences\\" was merely the bastard child of two drunkenly weaving columns--we had been supposed to get two dozen jumbo eggs and a bottle of my mother's favourite brand of shampoo (ever inventive in creating proprietary abbreviations--\\"TC\\" standing for, what else, thin crust pizza--my mother scrupulously wrote out brand names in full). It was a little like ordering chemicals for a laboratory, sans any knowledge of chemistry--or, for that matter, laboratories, although my ignorance of the distinction between baking soda and baking powder cannot be entirely the root of my confusion. Eventually I--and my siblings--learned the difference between tomato paste and tomato sauce, and could readily distinguish one brand of laundry detergent from a similarly-styled knock-off, but my shame-faced trips back to the mothercart never ceased. I would track her down, most often in the produce section--she was usually loath to trust us with the delicate task of selecting the very best fruits and vegetables--and hand her back my portion of the list, asking for an explanation.

SINGAPORE — Envoys from the United States and North Korea are holding talks to iron out any last-minute differences before Tuesday's historic summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that veteran diplomat Sung Kim is leading the U.S. delegation in a working group meeting Monday at the city-state's Ritz Carlton hotel. The North Korea side is being led by Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui. Monday's meeting is apparently aimed at narrowing the gap between the U.S. and North Korea over the demand for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. President Trump expressed confidence about his meeting upon his arrival in Singapore Sunday, telling reporters after stepping down from Air Force One that he his feeling \\"very good\\" about Tuesday's summit. Ahead of his arrival, Trump acknowledged he is heading into “unknown territory” for the meeting Tuesday. In response to a question from VOA News just before heading to Asia from the Group of Seven summit in Canada, Trump said “I really feel confident” about the unprecedented encounter between a sitting American president and a member of the family dynasty which has maintained iron-fist control over one of the world’s most reclusive countries for three generations. Trump added that he believes Kim, half the age of the American president, “wants to do something great for his people.” But Trump cautioned that Kim “won’t have that opportunity again” if the talks do not go well -- describing this opportunity for diplomacy with the United States as a “one-time shot.” Trump and others in his government have said advancement has been made on obtaining a commitment from Kim to give up all his nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles. Progress could lead to a peace treaty and formally end a state of war on the Korean peninsula, which has persisted for nearly 70 years.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Dr. Donald Blake, a science professor at Dunsford University, receives delivery of a coelacanth. A student, Jimmy, asks Blake if the fish is really a million years old. Blake replies, \\"It's the species that's old. No change in millions of years. See, the coelacanth is a living fossil, immune to the forces of evolution\\". Blake lectures his students about evolution and devolution, telling them that man is the only creature that can decide whether to move forwards or backwards, and that \\"unless we learn to control the instincts we've inherited from our ape-like ancestors, the race is doomed\\". Inside the lab, Blake scratches himself on its teeth of the Partially-thawed coelacanth, accidentally sticking his bloody hand into the water-filled container which held the fish. Molly Riordan, assistant to Dr. Cole Oliver, is with Blake and offers him a ride home. When they get to Molly's car, Blake says he doesn't feel well and passes out. At Blake's home, Molly is attacked by person or persons unknown. Madeline Howard, Blake's fiancee and daughter of Dr. Gilbert Howard, president of the university, arrives and finds the home in shambles and Blake moaning on the ground. Madeline calls the police after seeing Molly hanging by her hair in a tree, her eyes wide, dead. Detective Lt. Mike Stevens and Detective Sgt. Eddie Daniels find a huge \\"deformed\\" hand print on a window and Blake's tie clasp in Molly's dead hand. They take Blake downtown when he admits that he can't remember anything after getting into Molly's car. Stevens releases Blake after concluding that someone is holding a grudge and trying to implicate Blake in Molly's murder. He assigns Daniels as Blake's bodyguard and tells Blake that Molly's autopsy showed she died of fright. Answer:","output":"The first names of the people who get to Molly's car, as per the given context, are Donald and Molly.  Donald, whose full name is Dr. Donald Blake, is a science professor at Dunsford University and he's a key individual in this narrative. He comes into focus when he receives a delivery of a coelacanth and shares his knowledge on the species with his students. He accidentally injures himself with the teeth of the coelacanth and then begins feeling unwell. Molly, whose full name is Molly Riordan, is an assistant to Dr. Cole Oliver. She is present with Donald during the incident with the coelacanth and offers to take him home when he starts to feel unwell, which is where they assume to make their way to her car. From the situation described, upon reaching Molly's car, Donald falls unconscious due to his unwell state, marking him as one of the individuals who gets to Molly's car. Molly, being the car owner and the one who proposed they travel by it, is undoubtedly the other individual on scene, hence making Donald and Molly the two individuals who get to Molly's car.

The AA said it was an ambitious timetable and that the practical and economic impacts needed to be examined. Clean Air In London said it was a wish list Mr Johnson wants others to do as he would only be mayor until 2016. London is among the worst in Europe for air pollution. Environmental Organisation ClientEarth has warned that in terms of European Union rules, London will have \\"illegal levels of air pollution until 2025\\". A London Assembly report last December found that 9% of deaths in the city were down to air pollution. In a speech to City Hall, Mr Johnson said: \\"Creating the world's first big city ultra low emission zone has the potential to be a game changing moment in the quality of life of our great capital. By Tom EdwardsTransport correspondent, London Poor air quality kills over 4,000 Londoners a year prematurely and many believe it is one of the largest public health crises facing the capital. The mayor has tried to cut pollution with cleaner buses, dust suppressors and green walls but London still breaches European limits. And that means large EU fines loom. There are also court cases ongoing with the government under pressure to show it's cleaning up our air. The authorities here are trying to show they are taking action. The question is will this idea of an ultra low emission zone in 2020 be enough? Legislation is already to an extent cleaning up cars and HGVs. Hauliers have welcomed dropping stricter Euro V limits on HGVs. But campaigners are really angry saying that is a backwards step. What is really striking is the lack of any detail. Transport for London has not even a timeline on a consultation and has not appointed any staff to look at this yet - so this is very early days. Environmental lawyers currently taking the government to court over air quality say this is nothing more than a PR stunt. Without details it's difficult to know. \\"My vision is a central zone where almost all the vehicles running during working hours are either zero or low emission. \\"This would deliver incredible benefits in air quality and stimulate the delivery and mass use of low emission technology.\\" City Hall said the mayor recognised that more work was required and believes his proposal would act as a challenge for vehicle manufacturers to ensure more affordable and low-emission technologies were in place. Simon Birkett from Clean Air In London said the timescale was far too long and that it would only cover the central Congestion Zone. \\"It's the biggest public health risk after smoking and we need bold action - he should have been starting on this in 2008 need bold action in two or three years, not seven or eight,\\" he added. Jenny Jones, the Green Party's London Assembly member, said the scheme was first put to the mayor by the Assembly in 2009. She added that London had been in breach of European guidelines for pollutant nitrogen dioxide since 2010. \\"This is excellent news for Londoners' health, but leaving it as a project for the next mayor to deliver is a way of ducking responsibility for the problems we're facing now,\\" she said. A spokesman for the AA said it was a tight timetable and questioned what impact this would have on police cars, ambulances, fire engines and vehicles used for essential deliveries. He added that decisions made now would be affected by this change such as companies buying a fleet of taxis would need to know if the vehicles would not be allowed in the zone in seven years. The mayor also announced that phase five of the Low Emission Zone would now only apply to TfL buses, which would save Â£350m in costs for businesses. Mr Birkett said this was a backward step, especially as the low emission zone was the mayor's own policy. The mayor also plans to introduce 1,600 hybrid buses by 2016 and a further Â£20m fund to help boroughs tackle local air quality hotspots. Summary:","output":"London's Mayor Boris Johnson announced plans to implement an ultra low emission zone in central London by 2020, allowing only zero or low-emission vehicles to operate within the area during working hours. The goal of this policy is to address London's issue with air pollution; the city is among the worst in Europe and is expected to have illegal levels of air pollution until 2025 according to European Union rules. Critics, such as the AA, consider this an ambitious timetable and question the practical and economic implications of the policy. Clean Air In London suggested that the plan lacks details and argued for bolder action to tackle the problem sooner. Environmental lawyers currently taking the government to court over air quality view the announcement as a PR stunt. In addition to the ultra low emission zone, Mayor Johnson plans to introduce 1,600 hybrid buses by 2016 and a £20 million fund to help boroughs address air quality hotspots."},{"instruction":"Q:Generate a question that has the following answer:  By using beauty spas.  for the following movie plot:  You have to watch this with tongue firmly in cheek.

The modern eastern boundary is Chelsea Bridge Road and the lower half of Sloane Street, including Sloane Square. To the north and northwest, the area fades into Knightsbridge and Brompton, but it is considered that the area north of King's Road as far northwest as Fulham Road is part of Chelsea. The football club Chelsea F.C. is based at Stamford Bridge in neighbouring Fulham.  - Roundhead was the name given to the supporters of the Parliament of England during the English Civil War. Also known as Parliamentarians, they fought against Charles I of England and his supporters, the Cavaliers or Royalists, who claimed rule by absolute monarchy and the divine right of kings. The goal of the Roundhead party was to give the Parliament supreme control over executive administration.  - Viscount Newhaven was a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1681 for Charles Cheyne (or Cheyney), Member of Parliament and Clerk of the Pipe. He was made Lord Cheyne at the same time, also in the Peerage of Scotland. He married Lady Jane Cavendish, daughter of the first Duke of Newcastle and had a son, William Cheyne, who became 2nd Viscount Newhaven. William was a landowner in Chelsea, London, having purchased Henry VIII's palace. He died in 1728 leaving no male heir, the titles becoming extinct.  - The Battle of Worcester took place on 3 September 1651 at Worcester, England, and was the final battle of the English Civil War. Oliver Cromwell's Parliamentarian \\"New Model Army\\", 28,000 strong, defeated King Charles II's 16,000 Royalists, of whom the vast majority were Scottish.  - Cavalier first used by Roundheads as a term of abuse for the wealthier male Royalist supporters of King Charles I and his son Charles II of England during the English Civil War, the Interregnum, and the Restoration (1642  c. 1679). It was later adopted by the Royalists themselves. Although it referred originally to political and social attitudes and behaviour, of which clothing was a very small part, it has subsequently become strongly identified with the fashionable clothing of the court at the time. Prince Rupert, commander of much of Charles I's cavalry, is often considered to be an archetypal Cavalier.  - The Peerage of Scotland is the section of the Peerage of the British Isles for those peers created by the King of Scots before 1707. Following that year's Treaty of Union, the Kingdom of Scots and the Kingdom of England were combined under the name of Great Britain, and a new Peerage of Great Britain was introduced in which subsequent titles were created.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the profession of the deceased man whose body is found to contain a note?  Ruthless killer Steve Michel is known to the public as \\"The Claw\\" for his way of killing his victims with his prosthetic hook. After his accomplices Ryan and Taylor have broken in and stolen furs from the Flawless Furs warehouse, Steve kills the guard with his hook. When the police arrive at the crime scene in the shape of Detective Dick Tracy, he talks to Humphries, who is the owner of the store; Peter Premium, who is a representative for the insurance company; and a man named Cudd, who is the insurance investigator. The insurance company only has twenty-four hours to find the stolen goods, or they have to reimburse the fur company. Tracy and his semi-competent assistant Patton examine the dead body at the morgue and find a note on it stating that there were three perpetrators performing the hit against the warehouse. It also mentions that they used a truck with the name \\"Daisy\\" on it. Unfortunately, the three perpetrators disguise the truck before Tracy can find it, and the lead is a dead end. The robbers soon leave their hideout in a local junkyard and go to a nearby bar to phone their boss and get new instructions. As they speak with the boss on the phone, their conversation is overheard by an informant, a blind beggar called Sightless, who goes to pass the information on. Sightless is sloppy and noisy when eavesdropping, and is nearly caught by The Claw. Still, he manages to escape the bar.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Question: \\"How was vinyl better than shellac when it came to records?\\"  Context: \\"In 1931, RCA Victor introduced their vinyl-based Victrolac compound as a material for some unusual-format and special-purpose records. By the end of the 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications. When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s, at a de luxe price. Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce \\"unbreakable\\" children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Vinyl offered several advantages over shellac when it came to records. Some of these advantages include: 1. Lighter weight: Vinyl records were significantly lighter than their shellac counterparts. This made them easier to handle, store, and transport. The reduced weight also made a difference when shipping large quantities of records, as it reduced the overall cost and resources needed. 2. Enhanced durability: One of the primary reasons for the development of vinyl records was to address the high fragility of shellac records, which were prone to shattering when dropped or exposed to sudden temperature changes. In contrast, vinyl records were relatively unbreakable and could withstand more rough handling. 3. Improved audio quality: Vinyl records provided lower surface noise compared to shellac, resulting in better sound quality. The vinyl material allowed for a more accurate reproduction of audio signals due to its ability to hold finer groove details. This led to a clearer and more enjoyable listening experience for listeners. 4. Better compatibility with new technologies: After World War II, new record players were introduced with lighter crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or osmium alloy. Vinyl records were better suited for these improved technologies, as they did not wear down as quickly as shellac records under these more delicate components. 5. Greater variety: In addition to the standard black vinyl records, manufacturers started to produce records in a range of colors and special designs, such as RCA Victor's transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings. This allowed for greater visual appeal and collectibility of vinyl records. Despite these advantages, the high cost of vinyl and its vulnerability to damage from heavy pickups and steel needles used in home record players initially made its widespread adoption for 78 rpm records impractical. However, with the introduction of new record player technologies and growing consumer demand for better sound quality, vinyl eventually became the preferred material for both musicians and listeners alike."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The reason may be easy to see: an overloaded tray, a shelf out of reach, a patch of ice on the road. But more often than not there is a chain of events leading up to the misfortune-frustration, tiredness or just bad temper-that show what the accident really is, a sort of attack on oneself. Road accidents, for example, happen frequently after a family quarrel, and we all know people who are _ , so often at odds with themselves and the world that they seem to cause accidents for themselves and others. By definition, an accident is something you cannot predict or avoid, and the idea which used to be current, that the majority of road accidents are caused by a minority of criminally careless drivers, is not supported by insurance statistics. These show that most accidents involve ordinary motorists in a moment of carelessness or thoughtlessness. It is not always clear, either, what sort of conditions make people more likely to have an accident. For instance, the law requires all factories to take safety actions and most companies have safety committees to make sure the regulations are observed, but still, every day in Britain, some fifty thousand men and women are absent from work due to an accident. These accidents are largely the result of human error or misjudgment-noise and fatigue, boredom or worry are possible factors which contribute to this.

It could be the most valuable cargo ever sent to the seabed.      “I feel very pleased, as a head of state, to inform Colombians that, without any doubt, we have found, the San José galleon 307 years after its sinking,” President Santos said, speaking in Cartagena, the walled city that was a main trading point during colonial times.      He had broken the news on Twitter on Friday night, without providing details.      “At dawn on Friday, November 27,” he added, “the Colombian Institute of Anthropology and History, assisted by the National Navy and foreign scientists, found in the vicinity of Colombia’s Caribbean Coast, an archaeological site that belongs to the Nave Capitana Galeón San José,” the president added.      The San José, a crown jewels of shipwrecks, holds a bounty estimated to be worth 4bn-17bn. The vessel is said to have been carrying a cargo of coins and bullion mined and smelted in Peru to Spain’s King Philip V, for his campaign in the war of Spanish succession*.      In a video posted on the presidency’s website, Ernesto Montenegro, head of the Colombian Institute of Anthropology and History, described the finding as a “major triumph.”      The archaeological site holds part of the original galleon’s structure, ballast and bronze cannons. Little else has yet been identified, but the government believes the wreck is untouched. Mr Santos has said all information related to this, is sealed under law as this is a “state affair.”      Evidence found of Stone Age wheat trade in UK Investigation of a submerged Stone Age site off Bouldnor Cliff shows that people living there around 6,000BC were consuming a primitive form of wheat.      Colombia had been involved in a lengthy legal battle with the Seattle-based commercial salvage company Sea Search Armada, or SSA, over breach of contract and ownership of the bounty. In 1980 a company now owned by SSA located the shipwreck’s area.      According to a 2013 statement by the company, “in 1984, the Colombian Parliament enacted a law eliminating SSA’s claims to its property.” In 2011 a US court ruled the ship was the property of the Colombian state.      “That treasure lying in its bed of coral,” as Gabriel García Márquez penned in Love in the Time of Cholera, may soon lie somewhere else. Under Colombian law, the treasure is cultural heritage belonging to the nation. The state can claim up to 50 per cent of the value of anything not classified as heritage.      *This story has been amended to correct a reference to the war of Spanish succession. ||||| Image copyright AFP Image caption President Juan Manuel Santos described the find as \\"one of the greatest in history\\"      The wreck of a Spanish ship laden with treasure that was sunk by the British more than 300 years ago has been found off the Colombian coast, says President Juan Manuel Santos.      \\"Great news! We have found the San Jose galleon,\\" the president tweeted.      The wreck was discovered near the port city of Cartagena.      It has been described as the holy grail of shipwrecks, as the ship was carrying one of the largest amounts of valuables ever to have been lost at sea.      Mr Santos said the cargo was worth at least 1bn (£662m).      The San Jose was carrying gold, silver, gems and jewellery collected in the South American colonies to be shipped to Spain's king to help finance his war of succession against the British when it was sunk in June 1708.      The vessel was attacked by a British warship just outside Cartagena.      Colombian officials would not reveal the precise location of the wreck, but Mr Santos said the find \\"constitutes one of the greatest - if not the biggest, as some say - discoveries of submerged patrimony in the history of mankind\\".      He said that a museum would be built in Cartagena to house the ship's treasures.

I’ve always wanted to run for office. Maybe governor one day. Would I be able to avoid the waves of bipartisanship, and actually do what I believe is the best for the people of my state.

Travis informs Ricardo that he has joined the police academy to become a road cop, surprising Ricardo who knew Travis as the owner of a gym. Travis explains he shut down his gym due to dissatisfaction with the lifestyle and the financial impediments such as high competition and rising rents. He admits that the gym business wasn't as glamorous as it seemed from the outside.  Ricardo expresses his concern about the risks involved in being a cop, especially in Brazil, but Travis reassures him that he primarily intends to be a road cop, which is less dangerous than, for example, anti-terrorist or drug police. Travis admits that his motivation to become a cop is the status and the potential earnings, contrary to Ricardo's belief that cops don't earn much. Travis mentions that as a road cop, one can make good money and the job isn't too hard. Ricardo inquires about any exams that Travis has to take as part of the police academy, to which Travis responds affirmatively, highlighting knowledge tests, physical exams, and psychology tests. Although he closed his gym, Travis assures Ricardo that he is still physically fit due to continuously working out and offering personal training for clients.

Hunter had been with Galahad from the beginning as its ranking or second ranking officer , had commanded it during its times of greatest trial , and was more responsible than any other individual for its record of achievement . ''  - Wyoming is a state in the mountain region of the western United States. The state is the tenth largest by area, the least populous and the second least densely populated state in the country. Wyoming is bordered on the north by Montana, on the east by South Dakota and Nebraska, on the south by Colorado, on the southwest by Utah, and on the west by Idaho. Cheyenne is the capital and the most populous city in Wyoming, with a population estimate of 63,335 in 2015.

Objectives for conquering these countries included the seizure of natural resources such as rubber and petroleum from European colonies in the region. Conflict in this theatre began when the Empire of Japan invaded French Indochina in September 1940 and rose to a new level following the Raid on Pearl Harbor, and simultaneous attacks on Hong Kong, the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore and Malaya on 7/8 December 1941. The main landing at Singora (now Songkhla) on the east side of the Isthmus of Kra preceded the bombing of Pearl Harbor by several hours. Action in the theatre officially ended on 9 September 1945.  - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II.  - A military alliance is an international agreement concerning national security, when the contracting parties promise to support each other in case of a crisis that has not been identified in advance. Military alliances differ from coalitions, as coalitions are formed for a crisis that are already known.  - The Indian National Army (INA; \\"Azad Hind Fauj\\"); (\\"Lit\\": Free-Indian Army) was an armed force formed by Indian nationalists in 1942 in Southeast Asia during World War II. Its aim was to secure Indian independence from British rule. It formed an alliance with Imperial Japan in the latter's campaign in the Southeast Asian theatre of WWII. The army was first formed in 1942 under Mohan Singh, by Indian PoWs of the British-Indian Army captured by Japan in the Malayan campaign and at Singapore. This first INA collapsed and was disbanded in December that year after differences between the INA leadership and the Japanese military over its role in Japan's war in Asia. It was revived under the leadership of Subhas Chandra Bose after his arrival in Southeast Asia in 1943. The army was declared to be the army of Bose's \\"Arzi Hukumat-e-Azad Hind\\" (the Provisional Government of Free India). Under Bose's leadership, the INA drew ex-prisoners and thousands of civilian volunteers from the Indian expatriate population in Malaya (present-day Malaysia) and Burma. This second INA fought along with the Imperial Japanese Army against the British and Commonwealth forces in the campaigns in Burma, in Imphal and at Kohima, and later against the successful Burma Campaign of the Allies.  - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II.

By 1913, the British Empire held sway over 412 million people, % of the world population at the time, and by 1920, it covered , % of the Earth's total land area. As a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, the phrase \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\" was often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories.  - Pueblo is a Home Rule Municipality that is the county seat and the most populous city of Pueblo County, Colorado, United States.

It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities.

Alfred Alder, a famous psychiatrist, had an interesting experience. When he was a small boy he got off to a poor start in arithmetic. His teacher got the idea that he had no ability in arithmetic, and told his parents what she thought in order that they would not expect too much of him. In this way, they too developed the idea, \\"Isn't it too bad that Alfred can't do arithmetic?\\" He accepted their mistaken estimate of his ability, feeling that it was useless to try, and that he was very poor at arithmetic, just as they expected.  One day he became very angry at the teacher and the other students because they laughed when he said he saw how to do a problem which none of the other students had been able to solve.  Adler succeeded in solving the problem. This gave him confidence. He rejected the idea that he couldn't do arithmetic and was determined to show them that he could. His anger and his new found confidence stimulated him to go at arithmetic problems with a new spirit. He now worked with interest, determination, and purpose, and he soon became extraordinarily good at arithmetic. He not only proved that he could do arithmetic, but he learned early in life from his own experience that, if a person goes at a job with determination and purpose, he may astonish himself as well as others by his ability.  This experience made him realize that many people have more ability than they think they have, and that lack of success is as often the result of lack of knowledge of how to apply one's ability, lack of confidence, and lack of determination as it is the result of lack of ability.

Article: Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the suspected mastermind behind the Paris attacks, died during a major police raid in a northern suburb of the French capital.      Officials confirmed Abaaoud was the target of the operation that developed into a siege in St Denis on Wednesday, as more details emerged about the man thought to have arranged the shootings which killed 129 people on Friday night.      Now a prominent member of Isis, Abaaoud first travelled to Syria last year - but seemingly not out of any great religious motivation.      \\"He did not even go to the mosque,” his older sister Yasmina told the New York Times earlier this year.      Like many who travel to the so-called “Islamic State”, his actions appear to have been motivated more by a thirst for power, violence and unaccountability.      Who was Abdelhamid Abaaoud, mastermind of the Paris attacks?      Abaaoud, in his late 20s, was born in Belgium and grew up in the Brussels suburb of Molenbeek, which has become a key focus for investigators in recent days.      He briefly studied at an exclusive Catholic school, before either dropping out or getting expelled and drifting into a life of thievery and drugs.      Abdelhamid Abaaoud boasted of his escape from authorities in Belgium following a failed terrorist attack in an interview published in Isis' propaganda magazine in February      According to his family, the young man showed much more interest in petty crime than Islam, and they were shocked when he took his 13-year-old brother Younes with him to travel to Syria in January 2014.      After he was trained and further radicalised in Syria, Abaaoud was able to return to Europe via Athens. He was picked up by European security services and reportedly even stopped by police but let go, after which he disappeared.      Officials identified the suspected mastermind as Abaaoud, a Belgian of Moroccan origin in his late twenties      In February, he gave an interview to the Islamic State English-language magazine Dabiq which suggested he was in Syria.      In the interview he claimed he had travelled to Belgium to \\"terrorise the crusaders waging war against the Muslims\\".      He also claimed a police officer who stopped him had failed to recognise him even after his picture had been sold to the media.

He said: “I was able to leave and come to Sham (Syria) despite being chased by so many intelligence agencies.      “All this proves that a Muslim should not fear the bloated image of the crusader intelligence. My name and picture were all over the news yet I was able to stay in their homeland, plan operations against them, and leave safely when doing so became necessary.”      Abaaoud is believed to have had links to previous foiled terror attacks in France, including one on a Paris-bound high-speed train that was thwarted when passengers overpowered a gunman in August. He was thought to have been involved in the attack remotely from Syria – a theory thrown into doubt by this week’s developments. ||||| At about the time Mr. Abaaoud began his return journey to Europe, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, a leader with the Islamic State — he now has a 5 million bounty on his head, offered by the United States — made an impassioned plea for the killings of disbelievers. “If you can kill a disbelieving American or European, especially the spiteful and filthy French, then rely on Allah and kill him in any manner or way however it may be,” Mr. Adnani said in a recorded message.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Western intelligence agencies, worried that the Islamic State was planning to widen its carnage from the Middle East to Europe, tried to track a slow but steady trickle of fighters in Syria as they headed home to the Continent.      A Belgian television station reported Monday that security services had been alerted to Mr. Abaaoud’s return to Europe by a telephone call he made from Greece to an inmate, the brother of a known jihadist, in Belgium.      The realization among security officials that Mr. Abaaoud was back in Europe led to a major operation to intercept him. A safe house for militants he had helped set up in eastern Belgium was raided in January.      There, two of his comrades, including the brother of the inmate he had called, were killed. The Belgian authorities trumpeted the raid as having thwarted “a major terrorist operation.”      But it missed its principal target, Mr. Abaaoud, who then somehow made his way back to Syria, which Islamic State refers to by its historical Muslim name, “Sham.”      “Allah blinded their vision and I was able to leave and come to Sham despite being chased by so many intelligence agencies,” he later told Dabiq, a slickly produced magazine published by the Islamic State.      It is not known whether Mr. Abaaoud had any direct contact in Syria with Mr. Adnani, the architect of what the C.I.A. director, John O. Brennan, on Monday called the Islamic State’s “external operations agenda.” As a low-level fighter, Mr. Abaaoud was unlikely to have mixed with senior figures in the militant group’s hierarchy, experts in Belgium said.      But the two men shared a passion for propaganda, with Mr. Adnani serving as the Islamic State’s official spokesman and Mr. Abaaoud featured in various recruitment campaigns.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Mr. Abaaoud also had an invaluable asset for Islamic State leaders eager to take their battle to Europe — a pool of friends and contacts back home willing to carry out attacks.      Like many of the jihadists who have carried out attacks in Europe, including the brothers who attacked the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in January, Mr. Abaaoud showed far more interest in thievery and drugs when he was a young man than in Islam, particularly the highly disciplined, self-sacrificing Salafi strain favored by many militants.      Nor was his family impoverished. His father, Omar, owned a clothing store off the market square in Molenbeek, a borough of Brussels, and the family lived nearby in a spacious if shabby corner home on Rue de l’Avenir — Future Street — near the local police station.      Despite his subsequent denunciations of the mistreatment suffered by Muslims in Europe, he enjoyed privileges available to few immigrants, including admission to an exclusive Catholic school, Collège Saint-Pierre d’Uccle, in an upscale residential district of Brussels.

An assistant to Saint-Pierre’s director, who declined to give her name, said he had apparently flunked out. Others say he was dismissed for poor behavior.      He then drifted into a group of friends in Molenbeek who engaged in various petty crimes. Among his friends were Ibrahim and Salah Abdeslam, two brothers who, like Mr. Abaaoud, lived just a few blocks away and are now at the center of the investigation into the Paris attacks.      Ibrahim Abdeslam was one of the suicide bombers on Friday, and Salah Abdeslam, who rented a car in Brussels that was used to transport some of the gunmen in the attacks on Paris, is the target of an extensive manhunt.      Mr. Abaaoud was arrested for petty crime in 2010 and spent time in the same prison in Brussels where Ibrahim Abdeslam was being held, according to the spokesman for Belgium’s federal prosecutor and Ibrahim’s former lawyer. It is not known if they were in touch while in the prison, but they did not stay long. After their release, they returned to Molenbeek, often hanging out at a dingy bar known as a hangout for drug dealers.      To the dismay of his family, which had not seen him show any religious zeal, Mr. Abaaoud suddenly moved to Syria in the beginning of 2014, according to jihadi experts tracking Belgian militants.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Soon after his arrival in Syria, where he stayed for a time in a grand villa in Aleppo used to house French-speaking jihadists, he explained his choice in a video: “All my life I have seen the blood of Muslims flow. I pray that God breaks the backs of those who oppose him” and “that he exterminates them,” he said.      Early this year, the French magazine Paris Match found a film that showed Mr. Abaaoud grinning and making jokes as he dragged corpses with a pickup truck.      “I suddenly saw my picture all over the media,” he told Dabiq. He added that “thanks to Allah, the infidels were blinded by Allah” and did not spot him when he returned to Europe at the end of last year.      He also somehow persuaded his younger brother, Younes, who was still in Molenbeek and only 13, to join him in Syria. The boy left Belgium for Syria on his own without raising any suspicion from the authorities.      Mr. Abaaoud’s father joined a state prosecutor’s case against his son in May for having recruited Younes.      “I can’t take it anymore,” Omar Abaaoud told local reporters at the time. “I am on medication,” he said, adding that his son had dishonored the family. “He destroyed our families. I don’t ever want to see him again.”      His father is now living in Morocco and wants to put the property on Future Street up for sale, a family friend said.      Now, Mr. Abaaoud is suspected of being a leader of a branch of the Islamic State in Syria called Katibat al-Battar al Libi, which has its origins in Libya. This particular branch has attracted many Belgian fighters because of language and cultural ties, said Pieter van Ostaeyen, who tracks Belgian militants.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Many Belgian Muslims are of Moroccan origin, he said, and speak a dialect found in eastern Morocco that is similar to a Libyan dialect. Aymenn Jawad al-Tamimi, who studies jihadi groups at the Middle East Forum, a research center in Washington, said there was no evidence yet that the Paris attacks had been ordered by Mr. Adnani or the Islamic State’s overall leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.      But he added that the soldiers at the Libyan branch that includes Mr. Abaaoud had played a prominent role in exporting violence. One of their tasks, he said, has been to organize plots that “involved foreign fighters, sleeper cells in Europe that were connected with an operative inside of Syria and Iraq, usually in a lower to midlevel position.”      About 520 Belgian fighters have gone to Syria or Iraq to fight, making Belgium the biggest suspected source, per capita, of foreign fighters for ISIS. According to posts on Twitter and other social media accounts, the two men who were killed during the raid in Verviers, Belgium, in January were members of Katibat al-Battar. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the suspected mastermind behind the deadly Paris attacks in 2015, was a Belgian national of Moroccan origin who grew up in the Brussels suburb of Molenbeek. Born in his late 20s, Abaaoud came from a privileged background and briefly attended an exclusive Catholic school before becoming embroiled in a life of petty crime and drug dealing. In 2014, he went to Syria, having shown no prior significant interest in religion, taking his 13-year-old brother with him. Further radicalized after receiving training in Syria, Abaaoud remained undetected by European authorities in his return to Europe via Athens. Before the Paris attacks, he was believed to have had links to other foiled terror attacks in France, including the attempted Paris-bound high-speed train bombing.  From a base in Syria, Abaaoud appears to have directed operations for the Paris attacks that ultimately led to his death during a major police raid."},{"instruction":"Instructions: In this task, you are given one english sentence.

The future of global shipping FORTUNE — Not since 1956, when a North Carolina truck driver named Malcom McLean created a standard-size container for cargo, has global shipping seen such radical change. Carriers are bigger than ever, ports are becoming automated, and routes are shifting. The volume of goods that move between ports in Asia now accounts for 13% of all seaborne trade, up nearly a third from a decade ago. Routes through the ice-free far north now beckon.

Minor Milestones Add Up for Knicks “That’s crazy,” said Eddy Curry, whose emergence has made such progress possible. “It kind of shows you how bad it was last year, being that we really haven’t played great basketball here this year.” Curry called the 23-59 season under Coach Larry Brown “a distant memory,” though it is one that still haunts the franchise. It also is the baseline for measuring improvement, which allows the Knicks to take a curious pride in their sub.-500 record. “It’s not over for us yet,” Curry said. “Everybody here is looking at the big picture, and that’s trying to make the playoffs.” To get there, the Knicks will need more nights like last night, when they showed the right combination of defense and composure to hold off a good opponent. They trailed by 10 points at halftime but took control with a 24-4 run to open the third quarter. With Stephon Marbury (15 points) attacking the basket, the Knicks put the Clippers (24-24) on their heels. Los Angeles made 4 of 19 shots in the third, scored 11 points and never got closer than 3 the rest of the game. “The third quarter was really an impressive quarter for us defensively,” Coach Isiah Thomas said. Given the way the season started, with Thomas bemoaning the Knicks’ lack of a home-court advantage, the .500 home record was no less noteworthy. “I never thought we would see .500 at home,” Thomas said. The Knicks benefited from a huge disparity in free throws, making 36 of 44 shots, compared with the Clippers, who made 14 of 20. Elton Brand led the Clippers with 22 points and 13 rebounds, but he never dominated the game. The Knicks also held Cuttino Mobley, the Clippers’ streaky shooting guard, scoreless. Mobley was guarded by the former Clipper Quentin Richardson and went 0 for 5. Curry again paced the Knicks, with 23 points and 8 rebounds. Jamal Crawford also had 23 points, 8 of them in a late burst that held off the Clippers down the stretch. “We pretty much had the game and we pretty much let it go in the second half,” said Tim Thomas, a former Knick. Thomas, who was sent to Chicago in the Curry trade 16 months ago, made his first return to the Garden and scored 22 points. The Bulls sent Thomas home early last season, and he later signed with Phoenix after the Suns had already played here. Thomas joined the Clippers last summer. The fans booed him, but Thomas, a native of Paterson, N.J., seemed to enjoy his return. He made two 3-pointers and two powerful dunks when the Clippers raced to a 12-point lead in the first half. Thomas dunked hard on David Lee, leaving Lee with a black eye. It was still swollen after the game. “I didn’t even notice it,” said Lee, who finished with 16 points and 10 rebounds. “I was running down court and my eye started to close up. I was more surprised than anything.” Steve Francis is practicing without restrictions and said he hopes to play sometime during the Knicks’ upcoming three-game road trip. “It’s a strong possibility,” said Francis, who has been rehabilitating a sore right knee for the past two months. The Knicks play road games at Utah, the Los Angeles Lakers and Golden State before heading into the All-Star Game break. ... Francis was a starter for the first five weeks of the season, but he will probably serve as a backup to Stephon Marbury. The Knicks do not have another natural point guard on the roster. “It gives you some veteran savvy in the backcourt when Marbury goes out and/or goes down,” Coach Isiah Thomas said. “At least you got someone savvy back there, who understands the position.” ... With two weeks left until the trading deadline, Thomas said he is “not looking to make any changes.” He dodged a question about whether he considered any player untouchable in trade talks, saying, “They’re all untouchable right now.” ... The Knicks lost two potential trading chips when they waived Mo Taylor and Jalen Rose — each of whom had an expiring contract — last fall. Their contracts could have been valuable to a team looking to shed payroll. Thomas said he did not regret the moves. “We’re pretty healthy as a franchise,” he said. “I think right now we’re in a place where we’re young enough and we’re good enough that we don’t necessarily need to go spend a lot more money.” However, Thomas refuted the notion that he no longer has the latitude to add payroll. “That is very inaccurate,” he said. ... Jared Jeffries returned after missing one game because of a bruised lower back. He played six minutes and did not score.

Translate to Romanian: The Ohrid Framework Agreement, which came into force in 2001, brought peace, better co-operation among ethnic communities and more minority rights to Macedonia. Romanian:","output":"Acordul-cadru de la Ohrid, care a intrat în vigoare în 2001, a adus pacea, o colaborare mai bună între comunitățile etnice și mai multe drepturi pentru minoritățile din Macedonia. Înainte de a analiza mai profund, discutăm cum a apărut Acordul-cadru de la Ohrid. În anul 2001, Republica Macedonia s-a confruntat cu tensiuni etnice între majoritatea slavă și minoritatea albaneză, care reprezenta aproximativ un sfert din populație. În cursul acelui an, un conflict armat a izbucnit între forțele guvernamentale macedonene și grupurile insurgente etnice albaneze, ceea ce a dus la temeri că acesta ar putea escalada într-un război civil. Acordul-cadru de la Ohrid a fost semnat la data de 13 august 2001 de către reprezentanții guvernului macedonean, rebelii albanezi, precum și membri ai comunității internaționale, inclusiv Uniunea Europeană și Statele Unite. Acest acord a pus capăt conflictului armat și a stabilit un nou temei pentru coexistența interetnică și drepturile minorităților în Macedonia. Unele dintre aspectele cheie ale Acordului-cadru de la Ohrid au fost: 1. Asigurarea reprezentării adecvate a etniilor la toate nivelurile guvernamentale, inclusiv atât în ​​administrarea centrală, cât și locală, precum și în instituțiile publice și în justiție. 2. Extinderea limbii albaneze ca limbă oficială în zonele în care aceasta este vorbită de cel puțin 20% din populație și recunoașterea ei ca limbă oficială la nivel național în cazul comunicării oficiale. 3. Reformarea educației pentru a asigura respectarea diversității și drepturilor culturale ale minorităților, inclusiv învățământul în limba albaneză la toate nivelurile și diversificarea curriculelor pentru a reflecta identitatea și cultura comunității albaneze. 4. Adoptarea unor măsuri de integrare a rebelilor albanezi dezarmați în forțele armate și în poliție, precum și punerea în practică a unui program de dezarmare și demobilizare în vederea prevenirii viitoarelor conflicte armate. Acordul-cadru de la Ohrid a fost important pentru stabilitatea și dezvoltarea Macedoniei, deoarece a adus pacea și a asigurat condițiile pentru o colaborare mai bună între diferitele comunități etnice. De asemenea, a permis oportunități sporite pentru minoritatea albaneză în domeniile social, politic și economic. În ciuda anumitor criticilor referitoare la implementarea lentă a unora dintre măsurile acordului, acesta continuă să reprezinte o piatră de temelie a stabilității interetnice și a drepturilor minorităților în Macedonia de Nord."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Information:  - Demon in My View is a vampire novel written by Amelia Atwater - Rhodes , and published on May 9 , 2000 . Originally entitled Bitter Life , it was published when the author was 16 . It is the follow - up to In the Forests of the Night , which she wrote at the age of 13 . The title refers Edgar Allan Poe 's poem \`\` Alone '' , which appears in the beginning of the book . The novel was an ALA Quick Pick . The Bulletin of the Center for Children 's Books remarked that it is \`\` A fast - paced vampire novel '' , while Publishers Weekly has said that \`\` readers will drain ... in one big gulp \`\` . The Bulletin calls it '' a fast - paced vampire novel with an anti-Buffy heroine and a studly vampire who are n't going to let a little thing like death stand between them . \`\`  - The vrykolakas (Greek , pronounced ), variant vorvolakas or vourdoulakas, is a harmful undead creature in Greek folklore. It has similarities to many different legendary creatures, but is generally equated with the vampire of the folklore of the neighbouring Slavic countries. While the two are very similar, blood-drinking is only marginally associated with the \\"vrykolakas\\".  - Shroud usually refers to an item, such as a cloth, that covers or protects some other object. The term is most often used in reference to \\"burial sheets\\", mound shroud, grave clothes, winding-cloths or winding-sheets, such as the famous Shroud of Turin or \\"Tachrichim\\" (burial shrouds) that Jews are dressed in for burial. Traditionally, mound shrouds are made of white cotton, wool or linen, though any material can be used so long as it is made of natural fibre. Intermixture of two or more such fibres is forbidden, a proscription that ultimately derives from the Torah, \\"viz.\\", Deut. 22:11.  - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.  - Detective fiction is a subgenre of crime fiction and mystery fiction in which an investigator or a detectiveeither professional or amateurinvestigates a crime, often murder.  - A novel is a long narrative, normally in prose, which describes fictional characters and events, usually in the form of a sequential story.  - A vampire is a being from folklore who subsists by feeding on the life essence (generally in the form of blood) of the living. In European folklore, vampires were undead beings that often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods they inhabited when they were alive. They wore shrouds and were often described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance, markedly different from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early 19th century. Although vampiric entities have been recorded in most cultures, the term \\"vampire\\" was not popularized in the West until the early 18th century, after an influx of vampire superstition into Western Europe from areas where vampire legends were frequent, such as the Balkans and Eastern Europe, although local variants were also known by different names, such as \\"shtriga\\" in Albania, \\"vrykolakas\\" in Greece and \\"strigoi\\" in Romania. This increased level of vampire superstition in Europe led to mass hysteria and in some cases resulted in corpses actually being staked and people being accused of vampirism.  - Romania is a sovereign state located in Southeastern Europe. It borders the Black Sea, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, and Moldova. It has an area of and a temperate-continental climate. With 19.94 million inhabitants, the country is the seventh-most-populous member state of the European Union. The capital and largest city, Bucharest, with its 1,883,425 inhabitants is the sixth-largest city in the EU.  - Edgar Allan Poe (born Edgar Poe; January 19, 1809  October 7, 1849) was an American writer, editor, and literary critic. Poe is best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre. He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in the United States and American literature as a whole, and he was one of the country's earliest practitioners of the short story. Poe is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre and is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction. He was the first well-known American writer to try to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career.  - Amelia Holt Atwater-Rhodes (born April 16, 1984), known professionally as Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, is an American author of fantasy and young adult literature.  - In the Forests of the Night is a vampire novel written by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, and published in 1999. Originally entitled White Wine, she wrote it at the age of thirteen. The book was published on May 11, 1999, about a month after she turned fifteen. It is the first novel in the Den of Shadows. It tells the story of a three-hundred-year-old vampire named Risika and her struggles throughout her life, both before and after she was transformed. The novel is told in first-person narrative by the protagonist, Risika. It was well received by critics.  - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.  - Folklore is the body of expressive culture shared by a particular group of people; it encompasses the traditions common to that culture, subculture or group. These include oral traditions such as tales, proverbs and jokes. They include material culture, ranging from traditional building styles to handmade toys common to the group. Folklore also includes customary lore, the forms and rituals of celebrations like Christmas and weddings, folk dances and initiation rites. Each one of these, either singly or in combination, is considered a folklore artifact. Just as essential as the form, folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts from one region to another or from one generation to the next. For folklore is not taught in a formal school curriculum or studied in the fine arts. Instead these traditions are passed along informally from one individual to another either through verbal instruction or demonstration. The academic study of folklore is called folkloristics.  - The undead are beings in mythology, legend, or fiction that are deceased but behave as if alive. A common example of an undead being is a corpse re-animated by supernatural forces, by the application of the deceased's own life force, or that of another being (such as a demon).  The undead may be incorporeal like ghosts, or corporeal like vampires and zombies. The undead are featured in the belief systems of most cultures, and appear in many works of fantasy and horror fiction. The term is also occasionally used for putative non-supernatural cases of re-animation, from early experiments like Robert E. Cornish's to future sciences such as cryonics and chemical brain preservation.    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'series' with 'den of shadows'.

After the September 11 attacks, it was necessary for conservatives to somehow explain away the fact that the US government gave 245 million dollars to the new evildoers du jour. Never mind the fact that authors such as Robert Scheer warned of aiding the Taliban as early as in May 2001. Never mind that they did so not out of some humanitarian motivation, but because of the Taliban's violent enforcement of the ban on opium poppies. Never mind that in a regime that is controlled by warlords, it does not matter who is authorized to distribute the aid -- the ruling regional warlords will seize control of it and use it to their own advantage.

In what would be his first screenplay, based on his own short story \\"Turn About,\\" William Faulkner delivers a bizarre story of loyalty, sacrifice, and really strange relationships. The story originally was about only the Tone, Young, and Cooper characters, but MGM needed to put Joan Crawford in another picture to fulfill her contract, and Faulkner obliged by creating a female role. Crawford insisted that her lines be written in the same clipped style as her co-stars' Young and Tone, leading to much unintentional hilarity as these three communicate in a telegraph-like shorthand that sounds like a Monty Python sketch (\\"Wuthering Heights\\" performed in semaphore). Seriously, the almost entirely pronoun-less sentences make Ernest Hemingway read like Henry James. The film also reflects some familiar Faulkner themes, with an almost unnaturally close relationship between brother and sister (as may be found in his \\"Sanctuary,\\" and elsewhere). When Young proposes to Crawford, in Tone's presence, in lieu of an engagement ring ALL THREE exchange their childhood engraved rings with one another. The closeness of Tone and Young is also noticeable, especially as they go off to their Thelma & Louise fate. Frankly, it's creepy. Not as creepy to this New Yorker, however, as the recurring theme of the massive cockroach, Wellington, which Crawford cheerfully catches (and which is shown gamboling over her hands--I had to turn away!) and Young turns into a gladiator. Blech. That being said, there are some nice performances. Young is particularly engaging in a scene where he's taken up in Cooper's fighter plane, and Roscoe Karns is delightful as Cooper's flying buddy. Tone, despite his inability to express himself through realistic dialogue, has a nice moment, dashing away his own furtive tears over his buddy Young's fate. Crawford, stripped of meaningful dialogue as well, mostly comes across as either wooden or melodramatic, which is quite a balancing act for one role. The battle scenes--not surprisingly, for a Howard Hawks film--are the most exciting part of the entire picture. But not enough.

Why can flat maps never be as accurate as a globe? Which shadow mapping technique is fast and accurate? OPTIONS: (i). no; (ii). yes;","output":"(i). No, these questions do not have the same meaning. The first question, \\"Why can flat maps never be as accurate as a globe?\\" is related to cartography (map-making) and is seeking an explanation for the limitation of representing a three-dimensional globe accurately on a two-dimensional flat surface. It is exploring the fundamental challenges involved in mapping the Earth's surface on a flat plane. The limitation exists because Earth is a sphere, and a flat map is a two-dimensional representation. Cartographers must employ mathematical projections to convert geographical coordinates from a spherical Earth onto a flat map. This process results in inevitable distortions in distance, direction, scale, or area. The areas near the poles usually appear larger than they actually are, while the countries along the equator may look smaller. So, in order to create a flat map, cartographers must choose which inaccuracies to prioritize and which properties to preserve. A globe, on the other hand, is a three-dimensional representation of the Earth that allows for far more accurate scaling and positioning. Distortions that occur on flat maps are minimized, as a globe maintains the correct relative size and shape of continents and oceans. The second question, \\"Which shadow mapping technique is fast and accurate?\\" is related to computer graphics. Shadow mapping is a technique used in 3D photo-realistic rendering, where shadows are added to objects to give the scene a more realistic look. The question seeks suggestions for the most efficient shadow mapping methods that offer both speed and accuracy. Several widely used shadow mapping techniques are available, each with its own pros and cons. Some techniques include: 1. Standard Shadow Mapping: A basic technique that renders the scene from the light source's point of view and checks if each pixel is in shadow or not, based on depth information. 2. Percentage-Closer Filtering (PCF): An extension to standard shadow mapping that takes a percentage of the pixels in the shadow to improve the appearance and reduce aliasing artifacts. 3. Variance Shadow Mapping (VSM): Stores depth variance information to enable smoother shadow transitions while also reducing light-bleeding artifacts. Different techniques may be faster or more accurate depending on the specific scene and requirements. It is essential to consider factors such as the complexity and size of the scene, the desired visual quality, and hardware limitations when choosing the most appropriate technique for a given scenario. In conclusion, these two questions address different subjects - one is about cartography and the other about computer graphics - and, therefore, they do not have the same meaning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I read a small ad in some horror magazine in the early nineties about Liebe des Totes (the love of the dead) or something similar. This of course awoke my curiosity so I ordered Nekromantik 1 & 2 and Der Todesking (The Death King). The Nekromantik movies are Ok, even kind of interesting and unique in their approach to the subject Necrophilia (even if they obviously are horror-opera entries rather than intended to invoke fear in the viewers mind, they are actually quite funny.) TODESKING, on the other hand is, in my opinion, one of the best films ever made. It consist of a series of scenes depicting the many facets of death. Death as an enemy; Death as a reliever, Death as the very fysical decomposition of the body. The film is a metaphor over life. It shows how fragile life is and how short our lives are. It reduces its viewers to the childs they (we) actually are. The fact that we cannot really understand the nature of Death, and hence neither the process of dying, is the core message of the film. This is a most realistic film. Never does Buttgereit try to hide death behind white roses or whatever. No matter what moral standards you set up, death is unevitable, and will sooner or later be not a fiction but YOUR reality. This applies to YOU, Dear Reader, like it applies to the viewers of the film. Some juvenile reviewers seem not to grasp this, which is fully excused, since they of course will live forever... This is no exploitation movie. Why? Because death does not exploit us humans. It harvests us. We grow for seven days, then we are brought back to the schopenhauerian state of pre-birth, that is Death. Buttgereit gives us his version of the oldest of tales. Whether you choose to regard it as \\"optimistic\\" or \\"pessimistic\\" is up to you. At first glance it may seem very dark. Consider though, that in order for something to live, something else must die. \\"Who wants to live forever?\\" I believe that when Buttgereit shows a body, that are being consumed by maggots, he shows not only decomposition, but GENERATION of new life. Is it not better to die and give life to maggots and then birds and eventually become soil, than to remain the living dead zombie that is one of the the favorite pets of the genre? When you realize this, you see Der Todesking it its right context. Sieben Tage hat die Woche, siebenmal letzte Stunden. Seven are the days of week (weak, mortal !), seven times the last hour. Dont fear the Reaper, Buttgereit tells us, because the Reaper takes only what is ripe. And apples that are not plucked for food will rot! Have a good life, fellow IMDB'ers !

A team of doctors from the Mayo Clinic declared Friday that there appears to be no physical reason why Sen. John McCain, the 71-year-old presumed Republican presidential candidate, could not carry out the duties of the office. \\"Sen. McCain enjoys excellent health and displays extraordinary energy, and, while it is impossible to predict any person's future health, I and my colleagues can find no medical reason or problem that would preclude Sen. McCain from fulfilling all of the duties or obligations of the president of the United States,\\" said Dr. John D. Eckstein, an internist who has been overseeing McCain's treatment for 16 years at the famed research center's campus in Scottsdale, Arizona. McCain has been undergoing periodic examinations there since the 1990s and annual examinations since 2000, Eckstein said. His most recent comprehensive examination took place in March, with follow-up tests this month. The doctors described a number of health issues faced by McCain, many of them typical for a man of his age but at least one of them potentially serious. McCain has had four malignant melanomas removed. Three of them -- on his left shoulder, left arm and left nasal wall -- were limited to the top skin layer and were not invasive. They were removed in 1993, 2000 and 2002, and all were declared Stage 0, of little long-term concern. But a fourth melanoma proved to be invasive and was removed from his left lower temple in 2000, Eckstein said. The surgery on McCain's temple was carried out in August 2000 by Dr. Michael Hinni, who described the melanoma as 2.2 mm thick at the thickest point and 2 cm across. Hinni said that, in order to leave a 2 cm margin that would minimize the risk of leaving some of the cancer intact, he had to remove a patch of skin roughly 6 cm in diameter, as well as an underlying carotid salivary gland from McCain's face. Dissection of dozens of lymph nodes showed no evidence that the cancer had spread, he said. According to the American Cancer Society, such a melanoma would be classified as Stage IIA, which is associated with a five-year survival rate of about 78 percent and a 10-year survival rate of about 66 percent. The wound required major reconstruction and has left the senator with a mass of scar tissue on his face. His left jaw appears prominent because because there was an absence of soft tissue on the face in front of his ear, Hinni said. CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta, who reviewed McCain's medical records, found previously unreported details about the operation.  Watch Dr. Sanjay Gupta on McCain's health records ». McCain developed swelling beneath the skin and had to be taken back for a second operation. One in 58 Americans will develop malignant melanoma in their lifetime, said Dr. Suzanne Connolly, McCain's dermatologist. This year, an estimated 116,500 cases will be diagnosed in the United States, with more than 62,000 of them invasive, she said. McCain has many of the risk factors associated with the cancer: light skin, light-colored eyes and a history of excessive sun exposure, she said. Though there is no sign of recurrence, McCain monitors his skin carefully, is examined by his dermatologist every three to four months and \\"practices good habits of sun safety,\\" she said. Connolly described the candidate's prognosis as good. \\"There is no way to predict with certainty the percentage, but the percentage would be thought to be in the single-digit area,\\" she said. McCain has also been treated for other less serious skin cancers, but Eckstein did not specify how many. McCain has had a number of more routine interactions with his doctors, not unusual for a man of his age. He has had four small kidney stones in his right kidney and a number of small benign cysts in both kidneys, but his kidney function is normal, Eckstein said. In August 2001, McCain noticed blood in his urine, and doctors found stones in his bladder that they used lasers to break apart. At the same time, they surgically removed enlarged prostate tissue, which was the cause of the bleeding, Eckstein said. Since then, McCain's urination has been normal, Eckstein said. McCain's prostate has showed no signs of cancer, and his prostate-specific antigen test -- which can indicate prostate cancer risk -- was also normal, Eckstein said. He said McCain takes the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide to prevent the formation of kidney stones. He takes the diuretic in a 25 mg dose, which is also the standard for treating high blood pressure. Eckstein said that, though McCain's systolic rate -- the top number in a blood pressure reading -- had sometimes been slightly high, the drug was being prescribed solely for kidney stone prevention. He added that he has encouraged McCain to reduce his salt intake, another method of lowering blood pressure. McCain first had an adenomatous colon polyp removed in the 1990s. Though the next two tests -- performed years apart -- proved negative, the most recent test carried out last month revealed six of the polyps, all of which were removed, Eckstein said. Though the polyps were all of the type that are potentially precancerous, they were found so early that they pose little threat, he said. McCain will continue to have periodic colonoscopies, the doctor said. McCain has displayed no evidence of heart disease or other cardiovascular disease, Eckstein said. \\"Indeed, he walked the Grand Canyon rim to rim in August 2006\\" and hikes whenever his schedule permits, he said. A stress echocardiogram carried out in March was \\"entirely normal,\\" he said. McCain has also been treated for high lipid levels. Eckstein said he originally prescribed Vytorin, but a recent study raised questions about its efficacy, and he recently switched the Republican candidate to simvastatin. McCain has had orthopedic problems in the past, many of them traced to October 1967, when the Navy flier's plane was shot down over Vietnam. He broke both arms and a leg when he ejected and spent the next 5½ years as a prisoner of war in Hanoi. During that time, he was beaten and tortured repeatedly, suffering fractures of both shoulders. Because he received no treatment for his fractures, they healed improperly, leaving him with reduced range of motion for his shoulders, arms and right knee, Eckstein said. McCain takes a daily aspirin to prevent formation of blood clots; an occasional Zyrtec, an antihistamine used for nasal allergies; and the sleep agent Ambien CR for treatment of insomnia when he travels. He also takes a multi-vitamin tablet. Some reporters, including CNN's, were allowed to examine McCain's medical records. In one, McCain's fasting blood sugar value was described as \\"impaired.\\" Asked to elaborate, Eckstein said he thought that the note referred to a 111 mg/dl blood sugar, with normals \\"in most labs\\" being between 70 mg/dl and 100 mg/dl. Eckstein said he followed that test result with another that he did not identify, \\"which was completely normal.\\" McCain, a two-pack-a-day smoker for 25 years, quit in 1980. He recently had a CT scan of his chest performed, and it proved normal, Eckstein said. The former pilot also sometimes experiences occasional dizziness when he stands, a benign condition called positional vertigo, Eckstein said. \\"When he and many other people arise from sitting or lying down, they get a sudden whirling sensation which may last two to five seconds and then disappears,\\" he said. \\"It does not indicate any vascular problem to the brain, and it is not a precursor to stroke.\\" McCain's father died of a stroke at age 70, but his 96-year-old mother is in good health and has appeared on the campaign trail with him. McCain released his medical records voluntarily. He did the same when he ran for president in 2000. The two Democrats competing for their party's nomination, Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. Hillary Clinton, have not released their doctors' files. Obama's campaign said it will release a summary of his medical condition next week, composed by his primary care physician.

This Week 12 showdown between the Colts and Eagles was originally scheduled for 1:00 ET, but due to the NFL's \\"flexible-scheduling\\" system this year, the NFL moved the game to Sunday night at 8:15 ET. This was the Colts' third primetime game this year on NBC, and the Eagles' first. There were 10 scores in this game, 5 each half. The first three scores of the game were by Colts rookie RB Joseph Addai. He had a 15-yard TD run, a 10-yard TD run, and another 15-yard TD run after that. His fourth rushing touchdown of the game came in the second half. The Eagles' first score came with about a minute to go in the half. Quarterback Jeff Garcia threw a 1-yard touchdown pass to L.J. Smith on that drive. On the Colts' next drive, combined with a couple passes and a 13-yard run by Dominic Rhodes, the Colts put K Adam Vinatieri in field goal range to get some more points before the end of the half. At the half, the Colts had a 17-point lead, 24-7. After a Reggie Wayne touchdown catch, the Colts were up big on the Eagles, 31-7. On the ensuing possession for the Eagles, Garcia found Reggie Brown in the end zone for a  3-yard score. But with less than 11 minutes left in the game, the Eagles scored once more and reduced the Colts' lead to 10 points. On the following possession, the Colts ran the ball 13 times with no passes and Joseph Addai had the last 8 carries on that drive including another 4-yard scamper, his fourth touchdown of the game. That touchdown also tied the Colts franchise record for the most rushing touchdowns in a single game. With less than four minutes to go in the game, the Eagles were desperate to score some points, but while Jeff Garcia was deep in his own territory, he dropped back to pass and was hit by both DE Robert Mathis and DE Dwight Freeney. Mathis knocked the ball out of Garcia's hand right before his arm started going forwards and CB Kelvin Hayden picked up the ball and ran it back for a touchdown. The Colts were up by 24 points after that last score. On the next possession, the Eagles put in backup QB A. J. Feeley in place of Garcia, and Feeley ended up getting the football knocked out of his hand by Robert Mathis (his second forced fumble of the game) and the Colts recovered and ended up running out the clock to conclude the game. Joseph Addai tied the NFL record for most touchdowns in a game by a rookie, with 4 touchdowns in this game. During this game, the Colts lost SS Antoine Bethea, TE Dallas Clark and OT Ryan Diem all to injuries in the first half, and they did not return. How many points were scored in the first half?","output":"In the first half, there were a total of 31 points scored. The Colts scored 24 points with three touchdowns by Joseph Addai and a field goal by Adam Vinatieri, and the Eagles scored 7 points with a touchdown pass from Jeff Garcia to L.J.

Answer a question about this article: From the 19th century, there was a revival in many ancient glass-making techniques including cameo glass, achieved for the first time since the Roman Empire and initially mostly used for pieces in a neo-classical style. The Art Nouveau movement made great use of glass, with René Lalique, Émile Gallé, and Daum of Nancy producing colored vases and similar pieces, often in cameo glass, and also using luster techniques. Louis Comfort Tiffany in America specialized in stained glass, both secular and religious, and his famous lamps. The early 20th-century saw the large-scale factory production of glass art by firms such as Waterford and Lalique. From about 1960 onwards there have been an increasing number of small studios hand-producing glass artworks, and glass artists began to class themselves as in effect sculptors working in glass, and their works as part fine arts.

The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations. In 1951 the United Nation's Refugee Convention defined a refugee as someone who \\"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\\" By the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations, 14.4 million of whom were under the mandate of the United Nations Human Rights Council.

The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue.

The notion of the ‘worried well’ is certainly alive and kicking. Vitamin and mineral supplements are big business. Reported figures in Australia suggest that 27% of women and 15% of men take some form of supplement with vitamin C, B complex, multivitamins, vitamin E and calcium all being popular choices. Contrary to the rationale for needing supplements in the first place, people who take supplements are more likely to be healthier than people who don’t take supplements. Supplement users also tend to be leaner, smoke less, exercise more, and eat more fruit and vegetables. While it may seem obvious that people who take supplements likely consume more nutrients from their regular diet to start with, this hasn’t been well studied in large population groups. Using data from a nationally representative government health survey, researchers from the United States looked at the mineral intake from food and supplements of over 8000 men and women between 2003 and 2006. The results were clear cut: people taking mineral supplements were consuming more minerals from their normal diet than those who didn’t take supplements. The observation was even stronger in women than in men. The eight most popular mineral supplements taken were calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc, phosphorus, copper, potassium and selenium. Proving that it is possible to have too much of a good thing, supplement users were more likely to be exceeding the recommended upper level of intake for magnesium, zinc, iron and calcium. For someone who believes that they are reasonably healthy and are conscious of what they eat most of the time, taking a mineral supplement ‘just in case’ offers little to no benefit.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: Is there a difference in meaning between \\"It's too late to telephone. Mary is asleep now.\\" and \\"It's too late to telephone. Mary will be asleep now.\\"? Yes. The difference is in the reason given for it being too late to telephone. In the first sentence \\"Mary is asleep now\\", the speaker is stating  a fact. In the second sentence \\"Mary will be asleep now\\", the speaker is saying what Mary usually does. In fact, it's possible that Mary isn't asleep, but she is usually asleep at this time. So let's take two situations. In the first case, imagine Mary's mother answers the telephone. You: \\"May I speak to Mary, please?\\" Mother: \\"No. It's too late. Mary is asleep now.\\" You: \\"Are you sure? It's only 10 0'clock.\\" Mother: \\"Yes. I went to her room and she was asleep.\\" The mother knows that Mary is asleep because she went into her room and saw her. Here is another case. Two friends decide to telephone Mary. Jack: \\"Let's telephone Mary. It's 10 0'clock.\\" Jill: \\"No. It's too late. She will be asleep now.\\" Jill knows that Mary always goes to bed before 10 o'clock, so now she'll probably be asleep. But it is also possible that she is staying up late. In which situation do you think the word \\"will\\" is used in the same way Jill uses it? A) Will you please lend me a hand? B) It's too heavy, I think. I'll help you. C) Don't get into his office. He will be angry now. D) You won't have to come to my office. I will send it to you. Answer:","output":"The word \\"will\\" is used in the same way Jill uses it in option C) Don't get into his office. He will be angry now. In this situation, the speaker is making an assumption or prediction about the person's emotional state based on their knowledge of that person's habits or typical reactions. Just like in Jill's example, where she assumes Mary will be asleep based on her usual bedtime, the speaker in this option is assuming that the person in the office will be angry at the moment, possibly due to their regular temper or behavior in certain situations.  In the other options, the usage of \\"will\\" is different: A) Will you please lend me a hand? - Here, \\"will\\" is being used to make a polite request instead of expressing an assumption or prediction. B) It's too heavy, I think. I'll help you. - In this example, \\"will\\" is used to express a future intention or decision made at the moment of speaking. D) You won't have to come to my office. I will send it to you. - In this case, \\"will\\" is used to make a future promise or assurance to the listener. In summary, the difference between \\"It's too late to telephone. Mary is asleep now.\\" and \\"It's too late to telephone. Mary will be asleep now.\\" lies in the speaker's level of certainty and the basis of their claim. In the first sentence, the speaker is sure that Mary is asleep, while in the second sentence, the speaker assumes Mary will be asleep based on her usual habits without necessarily confirming whether she is actually asleep or not. Option C best demonstrates the same usage of \\"will\\" as in the second sentence, where the speaker expresses an assumption or prediction regarding another person's behavior or emotional state without direct evidence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

From a geological perspective, it is considered a subcontinent of Asia.  - Yemen ('), officially known as the Republic of Yemen ('), is an Arab country in Western Asia, occupying South Arabia, the southern end of the Arabian Peninsula. Yemen is the second-largest country in the peninsula, occupying 527,970 km (203,850 sq mi). The coastline stretches for about 2,000 km (1,200 mi). It is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the north, the Red Sea to the west, the Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea to the south, and Oman to the east-northeast. Although Yemen's constitutionally stated capital is the city of Sana'a, the city has been under rebel control since February 2015. Because of this, Yemen's capital has been temporarily relocated to the port city of Aden, on the southern coast. Yemen's territory includes more than 200 islands; the largest of these is Socotra.  - Socotra ('), also spelled Soqotra, is an island and a small archipelago of four islands in the Arabian Sea. The territory is part of Yemen, and had long been a subdivision of the Aden Governorate. In 2004, it became attached to the Hadhramaut Governorate, which is much closer to the island than Aden (although the nearest governorate was the Al Mahrah Governorate). In 2013, the archipelago became its own governorate, the Soqatra Governorate.  - Sana'a (also spelled Sanaa or Sana; \\"\\" ) is the largest city in Yemen and the centre of Sana'a Governorate. The city is not part of the Governorate, but forms the separate administrative district of \\"Amanat Al-Asemah\\". Under the Yemeni constitution, Sana'a is the capital of the country, although the seat of the internationally recognised government moved to Aden in the aftermath of the 201415 Yemeni coup d'état.

The sea is underlain by the Red Sea Rift which is part of the Great Rift Valley.  - The Gulf of Aden (\\"\\") is a gulf located in the Arabian Sea between Yemen, on the south coast of the Arabian Peninsula, and Somalia in the Horn of Africa. In the northwest, it connects with the Red Sea through the Bab-el-Mandeb strait, which is more than 20 miles wide. It shares its name with the port city of Aden in Yemen, which forms the northern shore of the gulf. Historically, the Gulf of Aden was known as \\"The Gulf of Berbera\\", named after the ancient Somali port city of Berbera on the south side of the gulf. However, as the city of Aden grew during the colonial era, the name of \\"Gulf of Aden\\" was popularised.  - The Arabian Sea is a region of the northern Indian Ocean bounded on the north by Pakistan and Iran, on the west by northeastern Somalia and the Arabian Peninsula, and on the east by India.

Its population is approximately 800,000 people. Aden's ancient, natural harbour lies in the crater of a dormant volcano which now forms a peninsula, joined to the mainland by a low isthmus. This harbour, Front Bay, was first used by the ancient Kingdom of Awsan between the 5th and 7th centuries BC. The modern harbour is on the other side of the peninsula. Aden gives its name to the Gulf of Aden.  - Western Asia, West Asia, Southwestern Asia or Southwest Asia is the westernmost subregion of Asia. The concept is in limited use, as it significantly overlaps with the Middle East (or Near East), the main difference being the exclusion of Egypt (which would be counted as part of North Africa).

Typically, the lower limit of the saturation speed is determined by the sensor itself, but with the gain of the amplifier between the sensor and the analog-to-digital converter, the saturation speed can be increased. The factor 78 is chosen such that exposure settings based on a standard light meter and an 18-percent reflective surface will result in an image with a grey level of 18%/√2 = 12.7% of saturation. The factor √2 indicates that there is half a stop of headroom to deal with specular reflections that would appear brighter than a 100% reflecting white surface. What can too much exposure lead to?","output":"Too much exposure can lead to a clipped or bloomed camera output. Clipping occurs when the camera sensor is exposed to more light than it can handle, causing the highlights in the image to become overexposed and lose detail. This results in a loss of information in the overexposed areas, which usually appear as completely white or blown-out spots in the image. Blooming is a similar effect in which an overexposed area spills over into adjacent pixels, causing a spreading or smearing of bright regions in the image. Both clipping and blooming can negatively impact the overall image quality, reducing the dynamic range and making it difficult to recover details in post-processing or editing."},{"instruction":"Q: You are given a sentence in Japanese.

Well, we are on the verge of a move (whenever the house sells, we’ll move), and I keep thinking that I need to sit down and write a list of our “would likes” and our “must haves.” That way, when we are house hunting, we’ll already know what we’re looking for. For a chance to win an Un Amore custom-designed KitchenAid Stand Mixer from PartSelect, I have been thinking about the top three “would likes” for our new kitchen and decided to check out what KitchenAid has to offer! I discovered three appliances that would change our reality kitchen into a dream kitchen. We have two young boys that will change into tweens and teens before we know it. Big Brother has always been a good eater, open to trying just about anything we put in front of him. However, discovering that he actually does have some control over what he does, he’s lately turned up his nose on occasion. Little Brother is exactly like me when I was young. He turns his nose up at just about anything. Although he did just spend a week with his grandparents and decided he would eat and make up for lost meals…and make me out to be a liar! Anyway, I keep reminding myself as I find myself challenged at mealtimes, that soon enough, they’ll be eating us out of house and home. So, one of the larger dream kitchen appliances I’d like in our home would be a double oven! I just think it’d come in really handy when trying to keep up with their metabolism down the road! When you’re preparing a lot of food, you’re typically buying a lot of products, and the garbage and recycling bins fill up faster than ever as well. The second dream kitchen appliance I wouldn’t mind having would be the KitchenAid Trash Compactor, reducing our use of garbage bags and trips to the outside dumpster. Plus, I think I’d like not having to smell the garbage all the time!

The Ponte di Rialto is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Venice and one of the most iconic landmarks of the Italian city. Even in 1594, when the bridge was only recently completed, a British traveler called it the “eighth wonder of the world.” The version of the bridge that most people know was built between 1588 and 1591, but there’s been a bridge in this location since around 1180. The Rialto Bridge was the first bridge to cross the Grand Canal, and until the 1800s it remained the only bridge across Venice’s major waterway. The Rialto district was the main commercial hub of Venice and people increasingly needed access to buy and sell goods. The first bridge built at this site was a pontoon bridge that was eventually replaced by a wooden bridge in 1264. This wooden bridge was destroyed and rebuilt several times: it burned down during an unsuccessful coup in 1310, and in 1444 collapsed under the weight of a crowd watching a boat parade during a wedding. Its last collapse came in 1524, and by then Venice decided it was time to build a more permanent and durable bridge. Beginning in 1525, many architects submitted designs for the Rialto Bridge, but none of them was unanimously selected for the commission. The elected council overseeing the bridge’s construction deliberated and consulted several local builders to figure out how they could erect a stone bridge across the wide Grand Canal. They had a few limitations to consider: the sloped shores on either side, the need for boats to be able to pass underneath, and the practicality of having shops atop the bridge. Andrea Palladio’s design for the Rialto Bridge, published in his architectural treatise, Quattro libri, in 1570, featured three arches that would have prevented larger boats from passing under the bridge. Although his design utilized an appealing classical aesthetic, it was rejected in favor of Antonio Da Ponte’s.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: This is a general estimate of the minimum amount of space needed if you plan to let your cattle rely primarily on field roughage (grass) for food all year round. This estimate takes into account the fact that grass production slows in the winter months. More space is even better since it gives you a safety net in the event of any grass problems or drought. If you are working with a small farm space, it simply means that you’ll need to provide food supplementation in the form of cattle feed. Talk with your livestock vet about exactly how much grain your herd will require throughout the year, as it will vary by season.  You can buy cattle feed at your local feed store or even online via bulk suppliers. Cattle feed is usually a blend of grains, such as barley or wheat. There is no exact formula to figure out how to size paddocks or how to divide cattle into them. Take inventory of the animals that you own and think about natural divisions, such as keeping cows/calves separate from bulls. You’ll also want to balance out your herd, so that it will be easier to rotate between paddocks. As a general rule, the smaller your paddocks are, the more often you’ll need to rotate your cattle to keep them from depleting the area’s resources. Once you know the rough size and number of your paddocks, look at an overhead map of your land. Separate your land into square-shaped paddocks with alleys in between them. When mapping everything out, try to divide up natural water features.  Also, consider the location of any watering holes or stations. Ideally, you want your animals to avoid trekking up and down rough or uneven terrain to get to water. Segmenting shaded spaces into separate paddocks can also help minimize grass damage. As cows gather in shaded areas they tend to ruin the surrounding grass, so it’s best to isolate this activity to keep your grass healthy. Because there is always a bit of guesswork involved in paddock design, installing temporary polywire or polytape fencing lets you make adjustments as necessary without a major hassle. Use fiberglass or industrial plastic posts and attach the poly fencing in between at the height of a cow’s head. Electrifying the fence can provide an added level of security, too.  Your alleys should be somewhere between 16 to 20 feet (4.9 to 6.1 m) wide. This makes it easier to mow or move machinery in between paddocks. Placing a fine layer of gravel on your alleys will keep them from getting too muddy. Place your gates in the corners and design them with the rotation of animals between paddocks in mind. Make the transition to permanent fencing by using a rail and board or steel post design. If you plan to plant fresh grass in your paddock, do so at least 6 weeks before introducing your cattle. Kentucky bluegrass, alfalfa, orchard grass, and white clover are all good sources of nutrients for cattle. If you place your entire herd into a single paddock, they will eat away at the grasses and ruin the space. Instead, move your herd once or twice a day to different paddock spaces. Round up your cattle, open the connecting gates between paddocks, and drive your cattle into the new paddock space.  For example, you’ll need to protect paddocks with less productive grasses, such as Kentucky bluegrass. You may need to rotate your cattle out of this space more frequently. Adjust how frequently you rotate your cattle according to the specific season. In the spring and summer, you’ll need to move them more frequently to keep up with the grass growth. If extreme weather hits, you need to be able to move your cattle to a paddock with high ground, so that they can ride out the rain or flooding without injuries. Alternatively, you can build a barn or fenced in area with roof coverage for your cattle, but this is a luxury that many cattle owners do not create.  If you choose to keep your cattle in a contained area, muck out the manure regularly to avoid the spread of diseases. Check that the flooring of any housing is slip-resistant. This will reduce the possibility of injury to the animals, especially in wet conditions. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article discusses the importance of proper paddock management and rotation for cattle that primarily rely on field roughage (grass) for food all year round. It emphasizes the need for spacing, supplementation with cattle feed, and balancing herds for efficient rotation.

Question: SEOUL — The recent U.S. missile strikes against Syria could increase pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, or reinforce in Pyongyang the need for nuclear deterrence. The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

Graeme Obree (born 11 September 1965), nicknamed The Flying Scotsman, is a Scottish racing cyclist who twice broke the world hour record, in July 1993 and April 1994, and was the individual pursuit world champion in 1993 and 1995. He was known for his unusual riding positions and for the Old Faithful bicycle he built which included parts from a washing machine. He joined a professional team in France but was fired before his first race. Obree has created some radical innovations in bicycle design and cycling position but has had problems with the cycling authorities banning the riding positions his designs required. Obree had built frames for his bike shop and made another for his record attempt. Instead of traditional dropped handlebars it had straight bars like those of a mountain bike. He placed them closer to the saddle than usual and rode with the bars under his chest, his elbows bent and tucked into his sides like those of a skier. Watching a washing machine spin at 1,200rpm led him to take the bearings, which he assumed must be of superior quality, and fit them to his bike. Obree later regretted admitting to the bearings experiment, because journalists referred to that before his achievements and other innovations.  Obree called his bike \\"Old Faithful\\". It has a narrow bottom bracket, around which the cranks revolve, to bring his legs closer together, as he thought this is the \\"natural\\" position. As shown in the film, he thought a tread of \\"one banana\\" would be ideal. The bike has no top tube, so that his knees did not hit the frame. The chainstays are not horizontal to the ground. Thus the cranks can pass with a narrow bottom bracket. The fork had only one blade, carefully shaped to be as narrow as possible. A French writer who tried it said the narrow handlebars made it hard to accelerate the machine in a straight line but, once it was at speed, he could hold the bars and get into Obree's tucked style.  At a high enough speed, [I could] tuck in my arms. And, above all, get in a very forward position on the bike, on the peak of the saddle. The Obree position isn't advantageous simply aerodynamically, it also allows, by pushing the point of pedalling towards the rear, to benefit from greater pressure while remaining in the saddle. You soon get an impression of speed, all the greater because you've got practically nothing [deux fois rien] between your hands. Two other things I noticed after a few hundred metres: I certainly didn't have the impression of turning 53 x 13, and the Obree position is no obstruction to breathing. But I wasn't pedalling at 55kmh, 100 turns of the pedals a minute, yet my arms already hurt.

What is the answer for the question: What are the names of the four other dogs who died in Soviet space missions? from the following article ?  Laika is memorialised in the form of a statue and plaque at Star City, Russia, the Russian Cosmonaut training facility. Created in 1997, Laika is positioned behind the cosmonauts with her ears erect. The Monument to the Conquerors of Space, constructed in 1964, also includes Laika. On 11 April 2008  at the military research facility where staff had been responsible for readying Laika for the flight, officials unveiled a monument of her poised on top of a space rocket. Stamps and envelopes picturing Laika were produced, as well as branded cigarettes and matches.Future space missions carrying dogs would be designed to be recovered. Four other dogs died in Soviet space missions: Bars and Lisichka were killed when their R-7 rocket exploded shortly after launch on 28 July 1960; Pchyolka and Mushka died when Korabl-Sputnik 3 was purposely destroyed with an explosive charge to prevent foreign powers from inspecting the capsule after a wayward atmospheric reentry trajectory on 1 December 1960.Although never shown, Laika is prominently mentioned in the 1985 film My Life as a Dog, in which the main character (a young Swedish boy in the late 1950s) identifies strongly with the dog. Laika, a 2007 graphic novel by Nick Abadzis giving a fictionalized account of Laika's life, won the Eisner Award for Best Publication for Teens. Laika is also mentioned in the 2004 song \\"Neighborhood #2 (Laika)\\" by Arcade Fire, included on their debut album Funeral. Lajka (in English: Laika) is a 2017 Czech animated science fiction comedy film inspired by Laika. A:","output":"The four other dogs who died in Soviet space missions according to the article are: 1. Bars: Bars, along with Lisichka, was killed when their R-7 rocket exploded shortly after launch on 28 July 1960. Bars, which means \\"snow leopard\\" in Russian, was one of the dogs trained for space flights during the early days of the Soviet space program. 2. Lisichka: Lisichka, which means \\"little fox\\" in Russian, also died in the same rocket explosion as Bars on 28 July 1960. The R-7 rocket failed during the launch, causing a tragic end for both dogs. 3. Pchyolka: Pchyolka, which means \\"little bee\\" in Russian, was one of the two dogs aboard the Korabl-Sputnik 3 mission. Pchyolka and Mushka died when the spaceship was deliberately destroyed with an explosive charge on 1 December 1960. This was done to prevent foreign powers from inspecting the capsule after it took a wayward atmospheric reentry trajectory. 4. Mushka: Mushka, which means \\"little fly\\" in Russian, was the other dog who died along with Pchyolka on the ill-fated Korabl-Sputnik 3 mission. The spacecraft was purposefully destroyed to keep the capsule from being inspected by foreign powers, resulting in the tragic loss of both dogs. These four dogs, along with Laika, were among several dogs used in the early days of the Soviet space program. While Laika became the most well-known due to her historic role as the first living creature to orbit the Earth, Bars, Lisichka, Pchyolka, and Mushka also contributed to the development of this pioneering program."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: People of Iran had more respiratory diseases caused by fungi and viruses, while their neighbor Iraq had more disease caused by bacteria.  Which country had more people with tuberculosis?  Hint: Many respiratory diseases are caused by pathogens. A pathogen is an organism that causes disease in another organism. Certain bacteria, viruses, and fungi are pathogens of the respiratory system. The common cold and flu are caused by viruses. The influenza virus that causes the flu is pictured below ( Figure below ). Tuberculosis, whooping cough, and acute bronchitis are caused by bacteria. The pathogens that cause colds, flu, and TB can be passed from person to person by coughing, sneezing, and spitting. Illnesses caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics. Those caused by viruses cannot. A:","output":"Based on the provided information, we can infer that Iraq had more people with tuberculosis. To fully understand this conclusion, let's break down the facts mentioned in the question: 1. In Iran, respiratory diseases were primarily caused by fungi and viruses. 2. In Iraq, respiratory diseases were primarily caused by bacteria. 3. Tuberculosis, whooping cough, and acute bronchitis are caused by bacteria. 4. Illnesses caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics, while those caused by viruses cannot. Tuberculosis is a bacterial disease caused by the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Since Iraq predominantly had respiratory diseases caused by bacteria, it is more likely that this country had a higher incidence of tuberculosis compared to Iran, where respiratory diseases were primarily caused by fungi and viruses. It is also essential to note that bacterial infections, such as tuberculosis, can be treated with antibiotics, whereas viral infections, such as the flu, cannot be treated the same way. While it is impossible to pinpoint the exact number of tuberculosis cases in each country without further data, the information provided indicates that Iraq had more people with tuberculosis due to the higher prevalence of respiratory diseases caused by bacteria."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write an article with the title: \\"52 Years and Counting: America’s Longest-Serving CEOs\\" Article:","output":"Title: \\"52 Years and Counting: America’s Longest-Serving CEOs\\" Introduction In a rapidly changing business landscape, long-serving CEOs seem like a rarity. With the average CEO tenure in the United States lasting just 8.4 years (as reported by Equilar), it is truly remarkable when a CEO can not only maintain their position, but also successfully steer a company through turbulence and transform its business practices to thrive in market evolutions. This article highlights some of the most prominent long-serving CEOs in America, who have been at the helm of their organizations for more than half a century, combining leadership experience, adaptability, and vision that has ensured long-term success. 1. Warren Buffett: Berkshire Hathaway (52 Years) Warren Buffet, commonly known as the Oracle of Omaha, is perhaps one of the most widely recognized CEOs across the globe. With a net worth of over 84 billion, Buffett has cemented his position as a legendary investor and business magnate. He became Berkshire Hathaway's CEO in 1965 and has since grown the small textile conglomerate into a formidable multinational holding company. Under Buffet's leadership, Berkshire Hathaway has held diverse interests from insurance and banking to retail and transportation, consistently delivering above-average returns for its shareholders. Buffett is known for his long-term approach to investing and his knack for identifying undervalued assets. His wisdom and thought leadership are sought by prominent investors, politicians, and global leaders, and his \\"value investing\\" strategy has become the cornerstone of many investment portfolios. 2. Leslie H. Wexner: L Brands (58 Years) As the founder and former CEO of L Brands, formerly known as Limited Brands, Leslie H. Wexner has led the retail fashion empire for more than five decades. He started Limited in 1963 with a single store in Columbus, Ohio, and grew the enterprise into a multibillion-dollar retail conglomerate which includes acclaimed brands such as Victoria's Secret, Bath & Body Works, and formerly, The Limited and Express. Wexner's innovative marketing strategies and ability to anticipate customer preferences helped propel L Brands to become a leading name in fashion retail. His management style has been marked by risk-taking and a keen focus on growing brands to their full potential. 3. Roger Penske: Penske Corporation (51 Years) An icon of the automotive world, Roger Penske took over as CEO of the Penske Corporation in 1969. With activities in transportation, logistics, and professional motorsports, the Penske Corporation has shown remarkable success under Roger's guidance. One of the secrets to his long-term success in this role is his eye for sponsorship opportunities that have helped the company remain financially secure and relevant in the ever-evolving auto industry. Through strategic partnerships, acquisitions, and expansions, he has developed a diverse portfolio of businesses that tap into various aspects of the automotive trade. Conclusion In a time where the average CEO's tenure continues to shrink, the long-lasting tenures of Warren Buffet, Leslie H. Wexner, and Roger Penske are testaments to their stalwart leadership and ability to adapt to changing landscapes. Beyond their tenure, the impact these CEOs have had on their respective industries is undeniable. By blazing trails in their fields and remaining agile in the face of market transformations, these leaders paint an inspiring picture of resilience, adaptability, and unwavering determination that has propelled their companies through decades of sustained success."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Movie title: The World's End Movie plot: On June 22, 1990, Gary King (Simon Pegg) recalls himself and his four friends engaged in what was supposed to be a legendary pub crawl known as the Golden Mile in their hometown of Newton Haven, Herefordshire, England . Oliver Chamberlain was the straight-laced one who was called \\"O Man\\" for a birthmark on his forehead (which actually resembles a 6) that he eventually got removed. Peter Page was the youngest of the group. Steven Prince was usually competing with Gary for girls. Finally, Andrew Knightley was Gary's best friend. Gary, meanwhile, was the self-proclaimed leader of the group, dressed in all black and taking his friends through 12 pubs that night. The event was memorable for Gary, who managed to hook up with Oliver's sister Sam (Rosamund Pike) in one pub, but then ditched her to continue drinking. As the night went on, however, Pete and Oliver were left behind until it was just Gary, Andy, and Steven. They failed to make it to the final pub - The World's End - and Gary considered that night a failure. He is shown sitting in a sort of AA circle with others sharing their stories. It is obvious from the look on Gary's face that he plans on making sure the pub crawl will happen again, and this time, it will be a success.In the present day, Gary goes to round up his mates.1. Pete (Eddie Marsan) - Gary follows Pete from his house to his job at a luxury car dealership. While there, Gary meets Pete and Pete's father who owns the dealership.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Rivers are one of our most important natural resources  . Many of the world's great cities are located  on rivers, and almost every country has at least one river running through it that plays an important role in the lives of its people. Since the beginning of the history, people have used rivers for transportation . The longest one in the United States is the Mississippi. The lifeline of Egypt is the Nile. To the people of India, the Gangs is great, but it is also important for transportation; Ships can travel along it for a thousand miles. Other great rivers are the Congo in Africa and the Mekong in southeast Asia. The greatest of all for navigation  , however, is the Amazon in Brazil. It is so wide and so deep that large ships can go about two thousand miles upon it. Besides transportation, rivers give food, water to drink, water for crops , and chances for fun and entertainment for the people who live along their banks. In order to increase  the supply of crops, engineers sometimes build a dam   across a river and let a lake from behind the dam. Then people can use the water not only to irrigate   their fields but also to make electricity for their homes and industries. However, large cities and industries that are located upon rivers often make problems. As the cities grow in size and industries increase in number, the water in the rivers becomes polluted with chemicals  and other materials. People are learning the importance, however, of doing more to keep their rivers clean if they want to enjoy the benefits   of this natural resource.

Q:Information:  - An arcade game or coin-op is a coin-operated entertainment machine typically installed in public businesses such as restaurants, bars and amusement arcades. Most arcade games are video games, pinball machines, electro-mechanical games, redemption games or merchandisers. While exact dates are debated, the golden age of arcade video games is usually defined as a period beginning sometime in the late 1970s and ending sometime in the mid-1980s. Excluding a brief resurgence in the early 1990s, the arcade industry subsequently declined in the Western hemisphere as competing home-based video game consoles such as Playstation and Xbox increased in their graphics and game-play capability and decreased in cost.  - Gun Fight, known as Western Gun in Japan and Europe, is a 1975 arcade shooter game designed by Tomohiro Nishikado, and released by Taito in Japan and Europe and by Midway in North America. It was the first video game to depict human-to-human combat, while the Midway version was also the first video game to use a microprocessor. Following its November 1975 release in North America, it went on to sell over 8,000 arcade cabinets in the United States. It was ported to the Bally Astrocade video game console as a built-in game in 1977 as well as several home computer platforms.  - The Astrocade is a second generation home video game console and simple computer system designed by a team at Midway, at that time the videogame division of Bally. It was marketed only for a limited time before Bally decided to exit the market. The rights were later picked up by a third-party company, who re-released it and sold it until around 1984. The Astrocade is particularly notable for its very powerful graphics capabilities for the time of release, and for the difficulty in accessing those capabilities.  - Shooter games are a subgenre of action game, which often test the player's speed and reaction time. It includes many subgenres that have the commonality of focusing on the actions of the avatar using some sort of weapon. Usually this weapon is a gun, or some other long-range weapon. A common resource found in many shooter games is ammunition. Most commonly, the purpose of a shooter game is to shoot opponents and proceed through missions without the player character being killed or dying. A shooting game is a genre of video game where the player has limited spatial control of his or her character, and the focus is almost entirely on the defeat of the character's enemies using long-range weaponry.   - Redemption games are typically arcade games of skill that reward the player proportionally to their score in the game. The reward most often comes in the form of tickets, with more tickets being awarded for higher scores. These tickets can then be redeemed (hence the name) at a central location for prizes. The most inexpensive prizes (candy, small plastic or rubber toys) may only require a small number of tickets to acquire, while the most expensive ones (skateboards, low end electronics) may require several thousand. In general, the amount of money spent to win enough tickets for a given prize will exceed the value of the prize itself. Some redemption games such as Flamin' Finger involve elements of chance, which can be set by the operator.  - Pinball is a type of arcade game, in which points are scored by a player manipulating one or more steel balls on a play field inside a glass-covered cabinet called a pinball machine (or pinball table). The primary objective of the game is to score as many points as possible. Many modern pinball machines include a story line where the player must complete certain objectives in a certain fashion to complete the story, usually earning high scores for different methods of completing the game. Points are earned when the ball strikes different targets on the play field. A drain is situated at the bottom of the play field, partially protected by player-controlled plastic bats called flippers. A game ends after all the balls fall into the drain a certain number of times. Secondary objectives are to maximize the time spent playing (by earning \\"extra balls\\" and keeping the ball in play as long as possible) and to earn bonus games (known as \\"replays\\").  - The original console in the series was the first video game console to ship 100 million units, 9 years and 6 months after its initial launch. Its successor, the PlayStation 2, was released in 2000. The PlayStation 2 is the best-selling home console to date, having reached over 155 million units sold as of December 28, 2012. Sony's next console, the PlayStation 3, was released in 2006 and has sold over 80 million consoles worldwide as of November 2013. Sony's latest console, the PlayStation 4, was released in 2013, selling 1 million consoles in its first 24 hours on sale, becoming the fastest selling console in history.  - A microprocessor is a computer processor which incorporates the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) on a single integrated circuit (IC), or at most a few integrated circuits. The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock driven, register based, programmable electronic device which accepts digital or binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic. Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary numeral system.  - A merchandiser is an arcade gaming device, which features a machine that contains a display of merchandise, which can be won by playing the game. In the trade, such games are described as Skill With Prizes (SWP) games, and are a hybrid of games of skill and games of chance, with the preponderance of skill or chance differing between devices and often able to be set by the operator.  - Outlaw is a single - player arcade game by Atari Inc. , originally released in 1976 . It simulates an Old West fast draw duel between the player and the computer . Outlaw was a response to Gun Fight , released by Midway in North America the year before .  - The golden age of arcade video games was the era of greatest popularity and technological innovation for arcade video games. The exact time period is a matter of debate, but key moments include the release of \\"Space Invaders\\" in 1978 and the introduction of vector display technology in 1979. The golden age lasted until the late 1980s, when home video game consoles like the NES were introduced.  - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming.  - Early career. Nishikado graduated with an engineering degree from Tokyo Denki University in 1968. He joined Pacific Industries Ltd in 1969, a subsidiary of the Taito Trading Company. After working on mechanical games, in 1972, he developed \\"Elepong\\" (similar to \\"Pong\\"), one of Japan's earliest locally produced video arcade games, released in 1973. He produced over 10 video games before \\"Space Invaders\\" was released in 1978. He left Taito in 1996 to found his own company, Dreams. As of 2013, he is no longer with Dreams, and presently works for Taito as a technical advisor.  - A ball is a round object (usually spherical but sometimes ovoid) with various uses. It is used in ball games, where the play of the game follows the state of the ball as it is hit, kicked or thrown by players. Balls can also be used for simpler activities, such as catch, marbles and juggling. Balls made from hard-wearing materials are used in engineering applications to provide very low friction bearings, known as ball bearings. Black-powder weapons use stone and metal balls as projectiles.  - An amusement arcade (often referred to as \\"video arcade\\" or simply \\"arcade\\") is a venue where people play arcade games such as video games, pinball machines, electro-mechanical games, redemption games, merchandisers (such as claw cranes), or coin-operated billiards or air hockey tables. In some countries, some types of arcades are also legally permitted to provide gambling machines such as slot machines or \\"pachinko\\" machines. Games are usually housed in cabinets. The term used for ancestors of these venues in the beginning of 20th century was penny arcades.  - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.  - A video game console is an electronic, digital or computer device that outputs a video signal or visual image to display a video game that one or more people can play.    What is the relationship between 'outlaw ' and 'shooter game'? A:","output":"The relationship between \\"Outlaw\\" and \\"shooter game\\" is that Outlaw is an example of an early shooter game. Released in 1976, Outlaw is a single-player arcade game developed by Atari Inc. that simulates an Old West fast draw duel between the player and the computer. The player's objective is to shoot opponents using long-range weaponry, a common feature in shooter games. The game tests the player's speed and reaction time, which are also key elements in the broader genre of shooter games. Outlaw was developed in response to Gun Fight, another arcade shooter game released by Midway in North America in 1975. Thus, Outlaw represents an early entry and contribution to the development of the shooter game genre."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Following the round of touring for Vitalogy, the band went into the studio to record its follow-up, No Code. Vedder said, \\"Making No Code was all about gaining perspective.\\" Released in 1996, No Code was seen as a deliberate break from the band's sound since Ten, favoring experimental ballads and noisy garage rockers. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly stated that \\"No Code displays a wider range of moods and instrumentation than on any previous Pearl Jam album.\\" The lyrical themes on the album deal with issues of self-examination, with Ament stating, \\"In some ways, it's like the band's story. It's about growing up.\\" Although the album debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, it quickly fell down the charts. No Code included the singles \\"Who You Are\\" (sample ), \\"Hail, Hail\\", and \\"Off He Goes\\". As with Vitalogy, very little touring was done to promote No Code because of the band's refusal to play in Ticketmaster's venue areas. A European tour took place in the fall of 1996. Gossard stated that there was \\"a lot of stress associated with trying to tour at that time\\" and that \\"it was growing more and more difficult to be excited about being part of the band.\\" Following the short tour for No Code, the band went into the studio in 1997 to record its follow-up.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Here is an article: First Donald Trump said that he wanted to block nearly all foreign Muslims from entering the United States. More recently, he decided to stop using the word \\"Muslim\\" as he called for halting immigration from countries with high rates of terrorism, although he has yet to say which countries that would include. At a rally in Portland, Maine, on Thursday afternoon, Trump provided a lengthy explanation of why he thinks the United States needs to be skeptical of immigrants from many countries, even if they follow the legal process. Reading from notes, Trump listed nearly a dozen examples of immigrants, refugees or students who came to the United States legally -- often applying for and receiving citizenship -- and then plotted to kill Americans, sometimes successfully doing so. The countries that he referenced in these examples: Somalia, Morocco, Uzbekistan (he asked the crowd where it was located), Syria, Afghanistan, the Philippines, Iraq, Pakistan and Yemen (which he pronounced \\"yay-men\\"). Trump's staff has yet to confirm if there are countries from which the nominee wants to limit immigration. \\"We're letting people come in from terrorist nations that shouldn't be allowed because you can't vet them,\\" Trump said. \\"There's no way of vetting them. You have no idea who they are. This could be the great Trojan horse of all time.\\" At another point in the rally, Trump said: \\"Hillary Clinton wants to have them come in by the hundreds of thousands, just remember. This has nothing to do with politics, folks. This is a whole different level. This has to do with pure, raw stupidity. Okay?\\" Trump has long called for a crackdown on illegal immigration, which he has framed as a national security concern. In his announcement speech last year, Trump described illegal Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals. At numerous rallies, mothers and fathers whose children have been killed by illegal immigrants have shared their heartbreaking stories. Trump has said that building a wall along the border with Mexico will not only keep out illegal immigrants but also criminals, drug traffickers and terrorists. And he has proposed deporting the millions of immigrants illegally living here, starting with those who have committed crimes. For more than 10 months, Trump has opposed allowing any Syrian refugees into the country because they could be terrorists, and he has promised to kick out all Syrian refugees currently in the country. In December, Trump called for \\"a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.\\" Last month Trump said that his position on banning Muslims has \\"gotten bigger,\\" as he's now focusing on territories with terrorism problems. Last week Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity: \\"People don’t want me to say 'Muslim.' I guess I prefer not saying it, frankly, myself. So we’re talking about territories.\\" But he has yet to say which territories he would target. [Inside Donald Trump's strategic decision to target Muslims] About 13 percent of 318.9 million people living in the United States in 2014 were immigrants, according to the Migration Policy Institute, which is a massive increase from 1970, when the rate was less than 5 percent. Mexico is the most common home-nation of these immigrants, followed by India, China and the Philippines. Within minutes of taking the stage in Maine on Thursday afternoon, Trump warned the crowd of outsiders \\"pouring into our country,\\" and he promised to build a wall along the border.

Sessions has closely advised Trump for months and one of his former aides, Stephen Miller, is now a senior policy adviser to Trump and often speaks at Trump's rallies about the dangers of immigration.

England won the second half 13-0 and it could have been more. George Ford missed a kick; James Haskell ran into a post rather than over the line; a try by Dave Attwood was chalked off, debatably. Maybe, just maybe, 2015 will be a good year for the roses after all.

The passage is primarily about a rugby match that took place at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff where England emerged victorious. The tone of the narrative suggests that it's about the English rugby team. 2. Stuart Lancaster is associated with the English rugby team and served as the Head Coach of England's national rugby union team. 3. The option accurately continues the context of the match and its implications. It discusses internal team matters (significant here being the selection of team members) following the match. 4. The other options include names of players, journalists, or non-person entities (like 'Millennium Stadium', 'RBS 6 Nations', and 'Swing Low') being the subject of the sentence. Given the context, the choice of a former coach capping players fits more succinctly. 5. The use of the pronoun 'his' indicates that the person named in the sentence has an authoritative position, someone responsible for capping players for the team, which fits the role of the coach. By analyzing the context and clues in the passage and the options, I conclude that the ending featuring Stuart Lancaster would be the most fitting."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Help as much as you can. An archipelago in the Indian ocean included two very different islands. Snake island was a reptile paradise, inhabited by many species of reptiles. Bird island had few reptiles on it, but had various birds inhabiting it.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which island was inhabited by fewer turtles?  Hint: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw...

House takes action against Confederate flag, a symbol of treason One of the more notable things about congressional action to restrict the display of Confederate flags at Department of Veterans Affairs cemeteries was the debate before last week’s vote. Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) offered an amendment that would ban the flying of the flags on VA cemetery flagpoles, and no one said a word against it. Yet, many did vote no. Although their silence shows that it is increasingly unpopular to be associated with Confederate symbols, 159 House members, all Republicans but one, said no to Huffman’s amendment. Those Confederate symbols have become increasingly toxic since last year’s Charleston, S.C., massacre of nine black churchgoers. The alleged gunman, Dylann Roof, had posed with the Confederate battle flag. Another photo shows him burning an American flag. While he might have been driven by hatred and racism, those attributes are not all that the Confederate flag represents. That flag stands for treason. Confederates attacked the nation and killed U.S. government soldiers. Huffman also plans to propose House action against the display of Confederate flags in National Park Service cemeteries and the sale of Confederate memorabilia in park stores. Confederate flags currently are permitted on flagpoles in VA cemeteries on Memorial Day and the Confederate Memorial Day. Huffman’s amendment still must be approved by the Senate, so Monday, Memorial Day, might be the last time that rebel sympathizers can fly their stars and bars from flagpoles over VA graveyards. Huffman’s amendment does not prohibit small Confederate flags on individual graves. “Let’s stop pretending the Confederate flag isn’t a symbol of racism,” said Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), a sponsor of the bill. “The Confederate flag represents hate and intolerance and is a painful reminder of a terrible time in our history. VA cemeteries should be a place where we honor and pay tribute to American war heroes — not a place where we preserve the symbols of slavery and Jim Crow.” True. But the issue with the flag goes even beyond white supremacy. Although the Confederates were not tried for treason after the Civil War, their actions match the constitutional definition of the crime: “Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort.” That description certainly fits those who wore the Confederate gray or those who gave them aid and comfort. “The Confederate battle flag is also a symbol of treason,” said Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), another sponsor of the bill. Of Union soldiers, Ellison said, we “owe these brave Americans a solemn debt. We should ensure that the flag that their enemies carried so proudly does not fly above their graves.” Confederate symbols represent “opposition to the United States of America,” Huffman said, adding, “Even General Robert E. Lee recognized that symbols of the Confederacy are symbols of treason.” It is not only black people and liberal Democrats who have reason to oppose Confederate symbols — veterans do, too. Ironically, the lone Democrat who voted against the measure is a black man and an Army veteran, Rep. Sanford D. Bishop Jr. of Georgia. “While as a descendant of slaves I find the Confederate flag and the history it represents deeply offensive,” Bishop said in a statement, “I believe that the descendants of Confederate veterans should not be denied the privilege of honoring their dead ancestors two days of the year on a flagpole where their beloved are buried in mass graves.” None of the Republicans contacted would comment on their votes. But my colleague Amber Phillips published a message from an aide to Rep. Lynn Westmoreland (R-Ga.) to other congressional offices that linked opponents of the Confederate flag to the Islamic State terrorist group, also known as ISIS and ISIL. “You know who else supports destroying history so that they can advance their own agenda? ISIL,” wrote Pete Sanborn, Westmoreland’s legislative director, before the vote. “Don’t be like ISIL. I urge you to vote NO.” Westmoreland did vote no. But at least he was smart enough to distance himself from Sanborn, who Westmoreland said was reprimanded. But will he and the many other Republicans who voted against the amendment distance themselves from Confederate symbols when they next have the chance? “It is shameful that two-thirds of the House Republican Caucus voted against” the bill, Huffman said. “Why would anyone in Congress — let alone a majority of the governing party — still condone displays of this hateful symbol on our sacred national cemeteries?” Good question. There is no good answer. [The march against the Confederate flag continued Thursday — this time in Congress] [The Confederate flag isn’t just offensive. It’s treasonous.] [The House had a chance to take a stand on the Confederate flag. It didn’t.] What was this article about?","output":"This article is about the US House of Representatives taking action to restrict the display of Confederate flags at Department of Veterans Affairs cemeteries.

Thus, in less than twenty years, Rome had destroyed the power of one of the successor states, crippled another, and firmly entrenched its influence over Greece. This was primarily a result of the over-ambition of the Macedonian kings, and their unintended provocation of Rome; though Rome was quick to exploit the situation. In another twenty years, the Macedonian kingdom was no more. Seeking to re-assert Macedonian power and Greek independence, Philip V's son Perseus incurred the wrath of the Romans, resulting in the Third Macedonian War (171–168 BC). Victorious, the Romans abolished the Macedonian kingdom, replacing it with four puppet republics; these lasted a further twenty years before Macedon was formally annexed as a Roman province (146 BC) after yet another rebellion under Andriscus. Rome now demanded that the Achaean League, the last stronghold of Greek independence, be dissolved. The Achaeans refused and declared war on Rome. Most of the Greek cities rallied to the Achaeans' side, even slaves were freed to fight for Greek independence. The Roman consul Lucius Mummius advanced from Macedonia and defeated the Greeks at Corinth, which was razed to the ground.

I’m here in Dubrovnik, Croatia for a team meetup. Sadly, the weather has been pretty gray and rainy so far – in fact the forecast has it cloudy and rainy every day until after we leave. So I was pleasantly surprised to be awakened by the sun peeking around the edges of the curtain in my room, especially after the weather yesterday in which the wind gusted 35-40 mph – hard enough to blow the patio furniture around on my balcony (and at one point, catching a chair and flipping it against the rail so hard that if the rail had been just a bit shorter, it might have gone over). Our group all agreed that we should take advantage of the nice weather and head to the old city walls and St. Lawrence Fort (Lovrijenac). We spent several hours walking the walls and climbing up and down stairs. The sun sparkled off the Adriatic Sea and cast a warm glow on the orange and red tiled roofs in old city. It was such a change from the gray and foggy gloom of the last couple of days and it created a completely different mood, at least for me. From foreboding and dark to welcoming and bright. The clouds eventually rolled back in again, but the sunshine was nice while it lasted. We walked over to the fort and I took these shots of the city wall and from across the small cove between them. If you look closely in a few shots, you’ll see a stone pier, which is just between the Pile Gate (pronounced “peel-ay”) at the city walls and the fort.

Fungal meningitis has sickened 91 people across nine states, killing seven, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Sunday.      The outbreak seems to be growing by the day: The CDC on Saturday had reported 64 sickened.      Fungal meningitis cannot be passed from person to person, unlike some other types of the disease.      Researchers have linked the outbreak to steroid spinal injections from three lots of methylprednisolone acetate sent to clinics in 23 states, which have since been recalled. (See a list of those clinics here.) The injections were intended to relieve back pain.      The exact source of the contamination has not yet been pinpointed.      Tennessee has reported the most outbreak cases, with 32; Michigan has seen 20 and Virginia, 18. The CDC said several patients injected with the contaminated steroids have had strokes.      “In addition to typical meningitis symptoms, like headache, fever, nausea, and stiffness of the neck, people with fungal meningitis may also experience confusion, dizziness, and discomfort from bright lights,” the CDC says. “Patients might just have one or two of these symptoms.”      The steroid injections are not the same as those given to women during childbirth, according to the CDC.      On Sunday, U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) asked for stronger government oversight of so-called compounding pharmacies like the New England Compounding Center in Framingham, Mass., which is thought to have produced the contaminated steroids, according to the Associated Press.

Patients in nine states contracted the deadly fungal meningitis after being injected in their spine with a preservative-free steroid called methylprednisolone acetate that was contaminated by a fungus. The steroid is used to treat pain and inflammation.      What is meningitis?      The New England Compounding Center (NECC), the Massachusetts-based pharmacy that made the contaminated injections, voluntarily recalled three lots of the injected steroid last week. ||||| NASHVILLE, Tennessee U.S. health officials on Sunday reported an additional 27 cases in a fungal meningitis outbreak linked to steroid injections that has killed seven people and now infected 91 in nine states.      The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the new total of 91 cases in an update on its website, up from 64 on Saturday. Most of the new cases were reported in Michigan, where the total increased to 20 from eight. Virginia's total increased to 18 from 11.      The widening outbreak has alarmed U.S. health officials and focused attention on regulations of pharmaceutical compounding companies like the one that produced the drugs, the New England Compounding Center Inc in Framingham, Massachusetts.      The company shipped 17,676 vials of the steroid methylprednisolone acetate to 76 facilities in 23 states from July through September, the Massachusetts Health Department said.      The steroid is used as a painkiller, usually for the back, and could have been injected in thousands of patients, authorities have said.      Meningitis is an infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, and affected patients started showing a variety of symptoms from one to four weeks after their injections.      The company, which was previously the subject of complaints, has suspended its operations while an investigation proceeds and earlier recalled the three lots of the drug. It expanded its recall on Saturday to all products compounded and distributed at its Framingham facility.      According to an announcement on its website, the company issued the broader recall out of \\"an abundance of caution\\" because of the \\"potential risk of contamination.\\"      A compounding pharmacy takes medications from pharmaceuticals manufacturers and makes them into specific dosages and strengths for use by doctors.      Complaints against the company in 2002 and 2003 about the processing of medication resulted in an agreement with government agencies in 2006 to correct deficiencies, the Massachusetts Health Department said.      LIMITED FDA AUTHORITY      In 2011, there was another inspection of the facility and no deficiencies were found. In March 2012, another complaint was made about the potency of a product used in eye surgery procedures. That investigation is continuing, the state health department said.      The U.S. Food and Drug administration has limited authority over the day-to-day operations of compounding pharmacies, which are regulated primarily by state boards that oversee the practices, licensing and certification of pharmacies and pharmacists.      Compounded products do not have to win FDA approval before they are sold, and the agency has no jurisdiction over how the products are manufactured or labeled for use. Instead, the FDA investigates cases of adulterated drugs in cooperation with state regulators.      The FDA has tried to exert greater authority over compounded drug products under a section of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act that covers new drugs. But those efforts led to federal court challenges that resulted in two separate and conflicting rulings at the appellate level.      The nine states where fungal meningitis cases have been reported are Florida, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee and Virginia.      Tennessee, where the outbreak was first detected, accounted for most of the cases, with 32, including three deaths. Many patients there remain hospitalized, some in critical condition.      Michigan had 20 cases and two deaths. One person died in Maryland and another in Virginia, the CDC said.      Reuters had reported 65 cases on Saturday, including one additional case after the CDC published its total.      Fungal meningitis is not contagious, the CDC said. Symptoms include fever, headache, nausea and neurological problems that would be consistent with deep brain stroke.      The steroid was sent to California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia, the CDC said.      A list of facilities that received vials from the infected lots can be found via the website cdc.gov.

The second question asks about direct entry officers in the Indian military, rising to the position of Army commander through IMA (Indian Military Academy) or OTA (Officers Training Academy), and not being an ex-NDA (National Defence Academy) officer. Step 2: Analyzing the context These questions seem unrelated as the first question is about a university, and the second question is about the Indian military's direct entry officers and their career progression to become an Army commander. Step 3: Comparing the answers  I will provide individual answers to the questions: Answer 1: Dayananda Sagar University (DSU) Bangalore is a private university established in 2014. It offers undergraduate and postgraduate programs in various fields such as Engineering, Management, Commerce, Pharmacy, and Applied Sciences. DSU Bangalore is known for its state-of-the-art infrastructure, experienced faculty, and emphasis on research and innovation. The university has collaborations with several international institutions and industries to provide global exposure to its students. Answer 2: In the Indian military, officers who are not ex-NDA can also rise through the ranks and achieve the position of Army commander through their exceptional performance, dedication, and leadership skills. One example is General Ved Prakash Malik, who was an Army commander and served as the Chief of the Army Staff during the Kargil War. He is not an ex-NDA officer but joined the Indian Army through direct entry via the Indian Military Academy.

The Famicom contained no lockout hardware and, as a result, unlicensed cartridges (both legitimate and bootleg) were extremely common throughout Japan and the Far East. The original NES (but not the top-loading NES-101) contained the 10NES lockout chip, which significantly increased the challenges faced by unlicensed developers. Tinkerers at home in later years discovered that disassembling the NES and cutting the fourth pin of the lockout chip would change the chip’s mode of operation from \\"lock\\" to \\"key\\", removing all effects and greatly improving the console’s ability to play legal games, as well as bootlegs and converted imports. NES consoles sold in different regions had different lockout chips, so games marketed in one region would not work on consoles from another region. Known regions are: USA/Canada (3193 lockout chip), most of Europe (3195), Asia (3196) and UK, Italy and Australia (3197). Since two types of lockout chip were used in Europe, European NES game boxes often had an \\"A\\" or \\"B\\" letter on the front, indicating whether the game is compatible with UK/Italian/Australian consoles (A), or the rest of Europe (B). Rest-of-Europe games typically had text on the box stating \\"This game is not compatible with the Mattel or NES versions of the Nintendo Entertainment System\\". Similarly, UK/Italy/Australia games stated \\"This game is only compatible with the Mattel or NES versions of the Nintendo Entertainment System\\".

The vicious cycle is putatively fuelled by continuously high insulin/leptin stimulation and fat storage, as a result of high intake of strongly insulin/leptin stimulating foods and energy. Both insulin and leptin normally function as satiety signals to the hypothalamus in the brain; however, insulin/leptin resistance may reduce this signal and therefore allow continued overfeeding despite large body fat stores.

Article:","output":"Title: St. Louis' Gateway Arch Bombing Target and Alleged Murder Plots Uncovered Introduction: St. Louis’ iconic symbol, the Gateway Arch, was allegedly the target of a bombing conspiracy orchestrated by Brandon Orlando Baldwin and Olajuwon Ali Davis. The two men were arrested on Friday, following investigations regarding their potential involvement in criminal activities. In addition to the shocking revelation of a planned attack on the monument, they have also been accused of developing a murder plot involving high-profile individuals in the area. Baldwin and Davis have been indicted on separate gun charges and have pleaded not guilty. This article delves into the chilling actions and intentions of the accused and their disturbing plans. Background on the Suspects: The suspects in question, Brandon Orlando Baldwin and Olajuwon Ali Davis, are both United States citizens with backgrounds that have led authorities to suspect their malicious intentions. Although little is known about their personal lives, it is evident that the duo shares a similar radical mindset. Their common ideologies might have fueled their plans to carry out such atrocious attacks that could have left devastating consequences on society. Targeting The Gateway Arch: The iconic Gateway Arch, which represents the expansion of the United States westward, was identified as a prime bombing target by Baldwin and Davis. Had their plans come to fruition, the destruction of the arch would have irreparably damaged the historical, cultural, and emotional significance of the monument. The terror attack would have undoubtedly left an indelible scar in the hearts of millions of Americans who associate this architectural marvel with a sense of national pride and unity. The Murder Plot:  The sinister plot devised by the suspects did not merely end at damaging the Gateway Arch; they had more insidious intentions at hand. They targeted two of St. Louis County's prominent figures - Robert McCulloch, the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney, and Tom Jackson, the Chief of Police in Ferguson. The alleged murder plot against these individuals sheds light on the severity of the situation and the magnitude of danger that Baldwin and Davis posed to the community. Arrest and Indictment: Prompt action by law enforcement authorities led to the arrest of both suspects on Friday. Although Baldwin and Davis have been indicted on separate gun charges, the seriousness of the potential crimes they planned to carry out is grave. Investigations are ongoing to uncover the full extent of their activities and ascertain more information about their motives and affiliations. The suspects have pled not guilty to the gun charges, and the case is evolving as new evidence comes to light. The swift action and vigilance of law enforcement agencies have prevented potential tragedies that could have led to unspeakable horrors. The case serves as a reminder of the constant threat our society faces, as well as the importance of diligence and awareness in ensuring the safety and security of our communities. Conclusion: The attempted bombing of the Gateway Arch and the alleged murder plots against prominent St. Louis County figures are chilling reminders of the dangers that can lurk within society. It is imperative that law enforcement agencies remain vigilant and proactive in managing threats to public safety. The apprehension of Baldwin and Davis serves as an example of the effectiveness of a diligent law enforcement system and its role in maintaining peace and order. As the case unfolds, the hope is that justice will be served and the public can regain a sense of security and calmness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

These systems deter break-ins and crime because they offer a direct line to emergency services from inside your home, whether you are home or away. If burglars notice that your home is equipped with a home security system, they might pass on your house and move on to an easier target.  Only share your home security code with individuals whom you absolutely trust. If you think someone untrustworthy has obtained the code, change it as soon as possible. Choose a home security system with a lighted motion sensor. When these systems detect movement, they turn on flood lighting, making it easy to see what or who is approaching your home.  Some home security systems involve cameras. Be sure to invest in a high definition camera, so that if your home is ever burglarized and the cameras capture photos or video of the perpetrator, the images will be clear enough to give a good picture of the burglar. Don’t give burglars the opportunity to hide or lurk outside your home. Keep bushes and shrubbery trimmed and leave your porch light on, if possible. You want your home to be as uninviting to criminals as you can make it. While everyone loves a bright, airy space, window coverings are important to install so that your belongings aren’t on display for potential burglars. It’s especially important to keep your window coverings closed at night when it’s easiest for prowlers to look into your home for things they might want to steal when you’re gone. This is a basic but very important safety precaution. Before you leave your home or go to bed for the night be sure that all your doors and windows are locked, including your garage door, if you have one. This applies to your car, as well. Be sure that all your windows are closed and any valuables are out of sight or locked in the trunk. Timers help you control when your lights and TV turn on and off when you aren’t home. This gives the illusion of someone being home and can help deter potential home break-ins. Many timers can be programmed remotely with your cellphone and some even have a battery backup in case of a power failure. Offering personal information on your mailbox or exterior of your home invites stalkers and burglars to learn who lives at your address. For safety and anonymity do not advertise your name on the exterior of your home. If they keep an eye on your home while you’re gone, ask them to watch for any suspicious activity. Authorize them to report any strange activity or suspicious individuals to police or the neighborhood watch group in your absence. If you’ll be gone for more than a week, consider having the post office hold your mail and hire a teenager in the neighborhood to mow your lawn. An overgrown lawn with packages piling up at the front door is a dead giveaway to criminals that no one is home at your house. Make it a priority to have your home appear to have someone at home so that potential criminals will be deterred.","output":"A home security system, along with additional safety measures like trimming bushes, using window coverings, securing doors and windows, installing timers, and maintaining anonymity can effectively deter burglaries and protect your home."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: The New York Times But here, we stapled the sheets together and slid them into an envelope at the back of a cabinet labeled “Undocumented.” Unlike most of our other patients, Carlos didn’t have any identification. He gladly paid out of pocket for ointments and creams for incidental cuts and bruises. But what he really needed was a biopsy, a 200 procedure that, given the location of the mass in his neck, could not be done safely in the back of a van. We could find no medical office willing to schedule an appointment for a man without identification. One private hospital sent us a typed note: “This unfortunate gentleman will not be eligible for services here.” We told Carlos to go to the emergency room of the public hospital, San Francisco General. He was not yet sick enough to be formally admitted, though, so he sat on a gurney for six hours and was charged 1,085 for a bag of intravenous salt water he didn’t really need. He was passed a note instructing him to “follow up with your primary care provider.” The hospital eventually gave him an appointment for a biopsy; it was scheduled in five months and three weeks. Carlos kept the yellow appointment slip in the front pocket of his overalls. He would bike with it; his sweat stained the paper until the edges wore thin. “I will not miss this,” he said whenever we reminded him of the date. As a temporizing show of support before his biopsy, we would see him every Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. He would roll in, wheezing, but would smile after a brief breathing treatment or 15 minutes with a heating pad on his shoulder. During those early weeks of September, the health care debates raged on television. We watched as President Obama told Congress that illegal immigrants would not get health care coverage. We heard someone yell, “You lie!” On any given day, the bodies of illegal immigrants lie in San Francisco’s coroner’s office, found by police or firefighters in alleys or on sidewalks, unclaimed and unnamed. Before they died, their medical costs may well have been passed on to taxpayers. But it’s also true that many were taxpayers themselves. From 2000 to 2005, illegal immigrant workers paid an estimated 6 billion to 7 billion in Social Security taxes and about 1.5 billion to Medicare, according to the Social Security Administration. And the president’s Council of Economic Advisers has estimated that illegal immigrants pay 80,000 more in taxes per person than they consume in government benefits over their lifetimes. The question of whether to insure Carlos and others like him is really a decision about whether to pay now or later — that is, to pay for preventive medical care now, or to pay in the future for hospital and emergency services, or for the internment of unclaimed bodies. Carlos stopped coming to his appointments. Our driver would wait an extra 30 minutes for him to reappear, brushing off demands from traffic cops to make way for the evening restaurant crowd. Weeks passed. Carlos’s friends from the docks approached the van, wondering if we had seen him. Early one morning, a clerk at the public hospital handed me a message. Carlos’s red bike had turned up at a police auction. Sold, for 32. I fear the growth in his throat may have been cancer, that it may have killed him. The coroner’s office cannot tell us, but it would not be that surprising, really. At the age of 50, Carlos already had surpassed by an entire year the average life expectancy of a migrant laborer in the United States.

Due to a lack of identification, Carlos could not secure an appointment for a much-needed biopsy, despite being able to pay out-of-pocket for other treatments. Turned away by various medical institutions, he was charged exorbitant fees at the public hospital for unnecessary treatments, all the while waiting months for his biopsy appointment. The healthcare debates during former President Obama's administration highlighted the issue of whether undocumented immigrants should be given health care coverage. It is worth noting that many such immigrants, although unable to access healthcare, contribute towards taxes. Between 2000 to 2005, illegal immigrant workers paid an estimated 6 billion to 7 billion in Social Security taxes and about 1.5 billion to Medicare. Ultimately, the question of insuring the undocumented population may be a matter of paying for preventive care now or risking higher costs in the future in the form of emergency services or dealing with unclaimed bodies. In the end, Carlos stopped coming to his appointments, and his whereabouts are unknown. The author, a resident in internal medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, worries that the mass in his throat may have become malignant and potentially fatal, a sad outcome for someone whose healthcare needs remained unmet due to his undocumented status."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Pyótr Ilʹyích Chaykóvskiy, IPA: [pʲɵtr ɪlʲˈjitɕ tɕɪjˈkofskʲɪj] (listen); 7 May 1840 [O.S. 25 April] – 6 November [O.S. 25 October] 1893), was a Russian composer of the romantic period, whose works are among the most popular music in the classical repertoire. He was the first Russian composer whose music made a lasting impression internationally, bolstered by his appearances as a guest conductor in Europe and the United States. He was honored in 1884 by Emperor Alexander III, and awarded a lifetime pension. Although musically precocious, Tchaikovsky was educated for a career as a civil servant. There was scant opportunity for a musical career in Russia at that time and no system of public music education. When an opportunity for such an education arose, he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory, from which he graduated in 1865. The formal Western-oriented teaching he received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five, with whom his professional relationship was mixed. Tchaikovsky's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood. From this reconciliation he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style—a task that did not prove easy. The principles that governed melody, harmony and other fundamentals of Russian music ran completely counter to those that governed Western European music; this seemed to defeat the potential for using Russian music in large-scale Western composition or for forming a composite style, and it caused personal antipathies that dented Tchaikovsky's self-confidence. Russian culture exhibited a split personality, with its native and adopted elements having drifted apart increasingly since the time of Peter the Great. This resulted in uncertainty among the intelligentsia about the country's national identity—an ambiguity...  Guess a valid title for it!

The other three times, he brought his wife, a woman named Beyoncé with whom you may be familiar. In March 2010, they visited with their mothers. In August 2011, they visited as part of what Fox News would come to call the \\"Hip-Hop Barbecue\\" (which, Fox lamented, didn't create any jobs). And in December 2013, they visited the executive mansion with a new person in tow, someone logged in the White House files as \\"Blue I Carter.\\" We know all of this thanks to the White House's public disclosure of visitor records, and because of a significant upgrade to a tool we unveiled last week. You can explore it below. Clicking a time of someone's visit will now show you everyone else that visited with that person -- and you can click any of those names for a full list of their visits to the White House. As always, click the icon to flag a post as something you think we might want to take another look at. We also dove a bit deeper into the data we had on-hand. It's not surprising that the Carter-Knowles' visited the White House in December; on average, that month sees the most visitors, who arrive to check out the building decked out for the holidays. The most popular day of the week to visit has been Friday, followed by Saturday -- again reflecting when tours are popular. (Blue I. was there on a Wednesday.) It's tough to suss out too many overall trends, though, because the data provided by the White House is spotty. Two entire months -- July 2013 and February 2014 -- appear to be missing. One month is missing data on the destination of visitors. There are duplicates and typos galore. We plotted out all of the data we had to show how visits to the White House (and to the two other main destinations of visitors, the Old and New Executive Office Buildings) have evolved since Obama took office. The spike at the end of each year is noticeable, as is the fact that most visitors are there for tours. And so are anomalies in the data. We can use a particular week as an example of how the data aren't very illuminating. If we look at the days surrounding the attacks on American facilities in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012, it looks like this, broken down into half-hour increments. The red spike at the beginning of September 12 isn't anything nefarious; it appears to be visitors to the Vice President's residence that were incorrectly logged. Likewise the small red blip on midnight of Sept. 11. That appears to have been Biden's debate prep team coming at some point that day to get Joe Biden ready for his October 11 showdown with Rep. Paul Ryan. The big spike at noon on September 11th is a number of visitors, apparently families, who came to the mansion in between events on the president's schedule. The attacks unfolded between 3 p.m. and 11 p.m. on the night of the 11th. There were a number of visitors to the White House that evening, visiting a variety of different staffers. None were there to meet with the president, according to White House data. Again: Our hope is that you can help us sift through the data to see anything that emerges. Flag visitors that you think are interesting, and tell us why. And if your definition of \\"interesting\\" extends only to hip-hop royalty, just a heads up that we already looked them up, too.

Yes or no. The answer to this question is:","output":"No, the information provided in your query is about the current capital and the population of Nashville, which does not address how Tennessee became a state. Let me provide you with a detailed and long answer. Tennessee became the 16th state of the United States on June 1, 1796. The journey to statehood began with the early settlers, the land acquired from Native Americans, and the various events leading up to its admission into the Union. The area that would eventually become Tennessee was initially part of North Carolina, a British colony. Throughout the 1770s and early 1780s, increasing numbers of settlers came to the area, which consisted of various tribes of Native Americans, particularly the Cherokee. European-American settlers from colonies such as Virginia and North Carolina moved westward into the area in search of new lands for farming and expansion. After the Revolutionary War and the Treaty of Paris in 1783, the western territories of North Carolina became difficult to govern due to the vast distance between the state capital and the western frontier. North Carolina ceded its western land—which included present-day Tennessee—to the United States government in 1789, and Congress designated this territory as the \\"Southwest Territory\\" under the governance of the newly-passed Northwest Ordinance of 1787. Under the leadership of territorial governor William Blount, the Southwest Territory grew rapidly, with many settlers coming from North Carolina, Virginia, and other eastern states. By 1795, the Southwest Territory had a large enough population to warrant consideration for statehood. In the same year, Governor Blount called for a constitutional convention where representatives from the various counties could gather, deliberate, and draft a state constitution. The convention took place in Knoxville between January and February 1796. Delegates framed the new Constitution of Tennessee, which was heavily influenced by the constitution of North Carolina and the U.S. Constitution. This constitution provided structure for the government, including the establishment of a bicameral legislature and the roles of the governor, secretary of state, and other executive roles. Once the constitution was ratified, the people of Tennessee were asked to vote for a governor, members of a bicameral legislature, and other state officials. The elected representatives then sent a formal request to the U.S. government for admission. On June 1, 1796, President George Washington signed the bill approving the admission of Tennessee as the 16th state in the Union. Therefore, Tennessee's journey to statehood was marked by expansion, the growth of the Southwest Territory, and the drafting and ratification of a state constitution. Nashville, mentioned in your query, became the state capital of Tennessee in 1843, and is currently its second-largest city, but this information is not directly related to the state's admission process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the premise \\"All five of the agencies we reviewed have experienced challenges in managing their human capital.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"All five agencies have trouble with they human capital. \\" is true?","output":"To assess whether we can conclude that the hypothesis \\"All five agencies have trouble with their human capital\\" is true based on the given premise, let's first examine the meaning and structure of the premise and then relate it to the hypothesis. Understanding both these aspects will help us establish whether the conclusion drawn is valid or not. Premise: \\"All five of the agencies we reviewed have experienced challenges in managing their human capital.\\" The premise states that each of the total five agencies evaluated faced difficulties managing their human capital. The term \\"human capital\\" refers to the combined knowledge, skills, and experience of the employees within an organization. In this context, the challenges in managing human capital could involve aspects such as recruitment and staffing, training and development, employee retention, performance management, and workforce planning, among others. Hypothesis: \\"All five agencies have trouble with their human capital.\\" The hypothesis is a more general statement asserting that all five agencies struggle with their human capital. It suggests a continuous or ongoing problem with their workforce, without necessarily specifying which aspects of human capital management are problematic. Now, let's compare the premise and hypothesis to determine if we can conclude that the hypothesis is true based on the given premise. Both the premise and hypothesis point to the same set of five agencies, and both suggest difficulties related to human capital. While the premise explicitly speaks about \\"challenges in managing\\" human capital, the hypothesis uses the broader term \\"trouble.\\" Therefore, the challenges in managing human capital mentioned in the premise can be considered a kind of trouble these five agencies have with their human capital, as stated in the hypothesis. However, it is essential to recognize that the hypothesis' framing implies a continued or ongoing issue, whereas the premise conveys that each agency has experienced challenges in managing their human capital. The premise does not necessarily confirm if these challenges persist or whether the agencies were able to address and resolve their human capital management issues. In conclusion, based on the premise that all five of the reviewed agencies have experienced challenges in managing their human capital, we can reasonably deduce that all five agencies have had trouble with their human capital at some point, in line with the hypothesis. However, the premise does not provide enough evidence to support that these troubles persist or remain unresolved for all of the agencies. To firmly establish the truth of the hypothesis, additional information about the nature, extent, and ongoing status of the human capital issues faced by these agencies would be necessary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to English","output":"Everyone contributed: consumers, businesses, and member states. The phrase above can be translated into English and explained in more detail to understand its various elements and implications better. In this context, the phrase emphasizes the collective effort made by different stakeholders, such as consumers, businesses, and member states, to achieve a specific goal or address a shared concern. First, let's delve into the role of consumers in this collective effort. Consumers are the backbone of any market, as they shape the demand for goods and services and can influence business practices with their buying behaviors. By choosing to purchase environmentally friendly products, for instance, consumers can drive companies to adopt more sustainable production methods. Businesses also play an essential role in contributing to a particular cause or addressing societal challenges. Companies can enact policies that foster social and environmental responsibility, invest in research and development for innovative solutions, create jobs and drive economic growth. It is essential for businesses to integrate such practices into their core operations to ensure long-term sustainability and resilience within their industries and the global economy as a whole. Lastly, member states - or countries belonging to a particular organization or alliance, such as the European Union, the United Nations, or any regional cooperation body - have a significant responsibility in addressing global and regional challenges. Governments can enact policies, regulations, and provide funding to promote social, environmental, and economic well-being. Through international cooperation, member states can share resources, knowledge, and best practices to tackle pressing issues such as climate change, poverty, and inequality. In summary, the phrase \\"Everyone contributed: consumers, businesses, and member states\\" highlights the importance of collaborative efforts between different stakeholders to achieve common goals or address pressing challenges. This approach recognizes that tackling global issues requires the engagement and active participation of all actors in society, from individuals and private sector organizations to governments and international institutions. By working together, we can drive positive change and ensure a more sustainable and prosperous future for all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: As someone says this he pushes his way past the startled butler, pulling a handkerchief from the man's pocket.","output":"The most important words in the given sentence are \\"pushes,\\" \\"past,\\" \\"startled butler,\\" \\"pulling,\\" and \\"handkerchief.\\" By highlighting these key terms, we are able to gain a basic understanding of the essence of the sentence.  1. \\"Pushes\\" - This verb implies force or aggression and suggests that the person saying the aforementioned phrase is encountering some kind of resistance or obstacle. This word helps to establish the tense and assertive atmosphere present in the scene. 2. \\"Past\\" - This preposition further clarifies the spatial relationship between the person speaking and the startled butler. It indicates that the individual has moved beyond the butler or gotten around him in some way. 3. \\"Startled butler\\" - This noun phrase tells us the role or profession of the person experiencing surprise in the scenario. Identifying the butler as the subject of the sentence allows us to understand the context and imagine the setting in which this incident is taking place, most likely an upscale household or an estate. 4. \\"Pulling\\" - Another verb, this term offers insight into the action being performed by the person speaking. In conjunction with the word \\"handkerchief,\\" it gives us an idea of the nature of the interaction between the person speaking and the butler. 5. \\"Handkerchief\\" - The object of the sentence, this noun specifies what is being pulled from the butler's pocket. Its inclusion is important, as it serves as a crucial detail that drives the narrative. By focusing on these significant words, the context of the interaction and the actions occurring in the scene can be mostly inferred. A person speaks while forcefully moving past a surprised butler, stealing a handkerchief from his pocket in the process. This presents a tense and dynamic situation, possibly hinting at an attempt to bypass the butler, or perhaps a more sinister motive."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Why do some of the things around us look red, some green, others blue? Colours are really made by reflected light. We see colour because most of the things reflect light. Something is red, for it reflects most of the red light. In the same way, if something is green, it reflects most of the green light. If something reflects all light, it is white. If it doesn't reflect any light, it is black. Some of the light is reflected and some is taken in and turned into heat .The darker the colour is, the less light is reflected, the more light is taken in. So dark-coloured clothes are warmer in the sun than light-coloured clothes. Question: When something reflects light, we can  _  .

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was one of Lissitzky's first major steps away from Malevich's non-objective suprematism?  At this point Lissitzky subscribed fully to suprematism and, under the guidance of Malevich, helped further develop the movement. In 1919–1920 Lissitzky was a head of Architectural department at the People's Art School where with his students, primarily Lazar Khidekel, he was working on transition from plane to volumetric suprematism. Lissitzky designed On the New System of Art by Malevich, who responded in December 1919: \\"Lazar Markovich, I salute you on the publication of this little book\\". Perhaps the most famous work by Lissitzky from the same period was the 1919 propaganda poster \\"Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge\\". Russia was going through a civil war at the time, which was mainly fought between the \\"Reds\\" (communists, socialists and revolutionaries) and the \\"Whites\\" (monarchists, conservatives, liberals and other socialists who opposed the Bolshevik Revolution). The image of the red wedge shattering the white form, simple as it was, communicated a powerful message that left no doubt in the viewer's mind of its intention. The piece is often seen as alluding to the similar shapes used on military maps and, along with its political symbolism, was one of Lissitzky's first major steps away from Malevich's non-objective suprematism into a style his own. He stated: \\"The artist constructs a new symbol with his brush. This symbol is not a recognizable form of anything that is already finished, already made, or already existent in the world – it is a symbol of a new world, which is being built upon and which exists by the way of the people.\\"In January 17, 1920, Malevich and Lissitzky co-founded the short-lived Molposnovis (Young followers of a new art), a proto-suprematist association of students, professors, and other artists. After a brief and stormy dispute between \\"old\\" and \\"young\\" generations, and two rounds of renaming, the group reemerged as UNOVIS (Exponents of the new art) in February. Under the leadership of Malevich the group worked on a \\"suprematist ballet\\", choreographed by Nina Kogan and on the... The answer to this question is:","output":"One of El Lissitzky's first major steps away from Malevich's non-objective suprematism was his 1919 propaganda poster \\"Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge\\". Pis was a transition from Malevich's suprematist style, and marked a new development in Lissitzky's work.  The propaganda poster was created during the height of the Russian Civil War between the \\"Reds\\" and the \\"Whites\\". Used as a political tool, the poster bore a simple yet profound symbolism: a red wedge breaking into a white form. This symbol was reflective of the battleground strategies used in the civil war, represented in the forms of the Red (communists, socialists, and revolutionaries) and White (monarchists, conservatives, liberals and socialists opposing the Bolshevik Revolution) factions. This piece was not just a visualization of the country's political climate but was also a significant artistic departure for Lissitzky. He moved away from the non-objective suprematism of Malevich, which was focused on pure abstraction, into a style that was much more relationally symbolic and politically resonant. He was, in a sense, building a new artistic symbol not based on anything already existent, but on the emerging world and its circumstances. This political and stylistic shift was illustrative of his view that art should not just represent a new symbol, but also reflect a new world that was being built by the people. This shift is considered one of Lissitzky's first significant divergences from Malevich's non-objective suprematism into his own unique style.  In the following years, Lissitzky would continue to distil his creative approach, co-founding the short-lived Molposnovis, and UNOVIS, both associations of artists dedicated to the exploration and development of suprematist art. But with \\"Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge,\\" Lissitzky had taken his first major step into a style his own, distinct from Malevich's. It marked a key evolution in his work, one that would resonate in projects that followed, as he continued to integrate art, symbolism, and the sociopolitical contexts of the time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Generate a question that has the following answer:  No Sergeant Thomas mentioned  for the following movie plot:  It is September 1971 and it is clear that the US is losing the Vietnam War. In the opinion of the average American soldier who came of age during the Peace movement of the 1960s, Vietnam was \\"lost a long time ago\\". Roland Bozz (Colin Farrell), a draftee who is opposed to the war, is shown to be an unruly soldier with no respect for authority; he disobeys orders and talks back to his superiors. He quickly befriends another recruit, Jim Paxton (Matthew Davis), an aspiring writer who records his experiences in a personal journal. Unlike Bozz, Paxton volunteered for the Army. Upon reaching their post, the company commanding officer Captain Saunders makes it clear that every soldier who passes through Fort Polk and Tigerland will be sent to Vietnam. He also states that any political views on the war are irrelevant at this point. As the film progresses, another side of Bozz is shown. Having \\"x-ray vision for loopholes,\\" Bozz finds ways for soldiers to get out of the army â one because he not only has children but also a handicapped wife; another soldier, Miter (Clifton Collins Jr.), who joined to prove his manhood but finds himself way over his head. At one point, another soldier approaches Bozz while on leave and asks for help getting out, saying \\"I was told if you don't wanna go to 'Nam, you either pray to Jesus, or go see Roland Bozz.\\" Bozz also shows his reasoning behind being opposed to the war: his human compassion. Eventually Bozz's natural leadership and ability earns him the title of squad leader (sometimes called acting Jack). Another private, Wilson (Shea Whigham), a racial bigot and instigator, continuously demeans Miter and Bozz. Bozz is the only one that retaliates, which results in a fight between the two. Paxton helps break up the fight and also earns the hatred of Wilson. Later, while doing live fire exercises, Wilson threatens Bozz with a pistol. Bozz tries to disarm Wilson, and the two wrestle each other to the ground, Wilson getting the upper hand and putting the gun to the back of Bozz's head... A:","output":"Did Sergeant Thomas play any significant role or have any influence on the actions and beliefs of Roland Bozz and other soldiers in the movie located at Fort Polk and Tigerland, set in September 1971 during the Vietnam War, where the plot revolves around the unruly draftee Roland Bozz, his friend Jim Paxton, and the challenges they face as they navigate military life and confront their own values and beliefs amid racial bigotry, violence, and opposition to the Vietnam War?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1839, Melbourne resigned after Radicals and Tories (both of whom Victoria detested) voted against a bill to suspend the constitution of Jamaica. The bill removed political power from plantation owners who were resisting measures associated with the abolition of slavery. The Queen commissioned a Tory, Sir Robert Peel, to form a new ministry. At the time, it was customary for the prime minister to appoint members of the Royal Household, who were usually his political allies and their spouses. Many of the Queen's ladies of the bedchamber were wives of Whigs, and Peel expected to replace them with wives of Tories. In what became known as the bedchamber crisis, Victoria, advised by Melbourne, objected to their removal. Peel refused to govern under the restrictions imposed by the Queen, and consequently resigned his commission, allowing Melbourne to return to office.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The Bee Gees were a pop music group formed in 1958. Their lineup consisted of brothers Barry, Robin, and Maurice Gibb. The trio were successful for most of their decades of recording music, but they had two distinct periods of exceptional success: as a popular music act in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and as prominent performers of the disco music era in the mid-to-late 1970s. The group sang recognisable three-part tight harmonies; Robin's clear vibrato lead vocals were a hallmark of their earlier hits, while Barry's R&B falsetto became their signature sound during the mid-to-late 1970s and 1980s. At Eric Clapton's suggestion, the brothers moved to Miami, Florida, early in 1975 to record. After starting off with ballads, they eventually heeded the urging of Mardin and Stigwood, and crafted more dance-oriented disco songs, including their second US No. 1, \\"Jive Talkin'\\", along with US No. 7 \\"Nights on Broadway\\". The band liked the resulting new sound. This time the public agreed by sending the LP Main Course up the charts. This album included the first Bee Gees songs wherein Barry used falsetto, something that would later become a trademark of the band. This was also the first Bee Gees album to have two US top-10 singles since 1968's Idea. Main Course also became their first charting R&B album.  On the Bee Gees' appearance on The Midnight Special in 1975, to promote Main Course, they sang \\"To Love Somebody\\" with Helen Reddy. Around the same time, the Bee Gees recorded three Beatles covers--\\"Golden Slumbers/Carry That Weight\\", \\"She Came in Through the Bathroom Window\\" with Barry providing lead vocals, and \\"Sun King\\" with Maurice providing lead vocals, for the unsuccessful musical/documentary All This and World War II.  The next album, Children of the World released in September 1976, was drenched in Barry's new-found falsetto and Weaver's synthesizer disco licks. Mardin was unavailable to produce, so the Bee Gees enlisted Albhy Galuten and Karl Richardson, who had worked with Mardin during the Main Course sessions. This production team would carry the Bee Gees through the rest of the 1970s.  The first single from the album was \\"You Should Be Dancing\\" (which features percussion work by musician Stephen Stills). The song pushed the Bee Gees to a level of stardom they had not previously achieved in the US, though their new R&B/disco sound was not as popular with some die hard fans. The pop ballad \\"Love So Right\\" reached No. 3 in the US, and \\"Boogie Child\\" reached US No. 12 in January 1977. The album peaked at No. 8 in the US.  A compilation Bee Gees Gold was released in November, containing the group's hits from 1967 to 1972. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: what happened next?","output":"After the release of Children of the World in September 1976 and the compilation album Bee Gees Gold in November, which featured the group's hits from 1967 to 1972, the Bee Gees continued to evolve and solidify their impact on the music industry. Their new R&B/disco sound, characterized by Barry's falsetto and Weaver's synthesizer disco elements, brought them a higher level of stardom in the United States. This was evident with the success of their singles \\"You Should Be Dancing\\", \\"Love So Right\\", and \\"Boogie Child\\". The Bee Gees' popularity further soared during the disco era of the mid-to-late 1970s, as they became prominent performers and songwriters. They contributed to the soundtrack of the iconic movie, Saturday Night Fever, which was a blockbuster hit in 1977. The album featured Bee Gees classics such as \\"Stayin' Alive\\", \\"How Deep is Your Love\\", and \\"Night Fever\\", which became defining songs of that era and cemented their status in pop culture history. The Bee Gees continued to record and release music throughout the 1980s and 1990s, exploring different musical styles and consistently showcasing their songwriting talents. While they experienced varying levels of commercial success during this time, their impact on the music industry remained undeniable. In 1997, the Bee Gees were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, acknowledging their long-lasting contributions to popular music. Tragically, Maurice Gibb passed away in 2003, leading to the disbandment of the group. Barry and Robin continued to perform as a duo for several years, until Robin's death in 2012. Today, Barry Gibb remains the last surviving member of the group, and continues to perform and produce music, honoring the legacy of the Bee Gees and the tight harmonies that defined their sound for decades."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When I walked in, nobody came to say, \\"Hello\\" or \\"Welcome.\\" I had to wait a long, long time, like from morning to lunchtime (well, it felt like it). That's not nice, right? Finally, a grumpy-looking waiter found me a table. But, oh no! The table was very dirty, like someone had spilled a big chocolate milkshake all over it and didn't clean it up. Yuck! When I looked at the menu, I could barely read the words – it was like trying to read a very old and faded treasure map. How could I choose the tastiest treat with a menu like that? After waiting and waiting, just like how you wait for your birthday to come, I finally ordered some yummy-sounding food. But when my food finally arrived, it didn't look yummy at all. My burger was tinier than a ladybug, and my fries were colder than ice cream. I tried to tell the grumpy waiter, but he didn't care. He just told me to eat my food and not be picky (even though I wasn't being picky at all). So, little buddy, I left Yummytown feeling very unhappy. I didn't get the good food or the fun time I hoped for. I think other people should know about my not-so-nice adventure, so they can choose a different place for their family and friends.

Q: Larisa Grollemond is conducting a comparative study of illuminations in the Mirror of History (Speculum historiale, Miroir historial) as a graduate intern in the Manuscripts Department of the Getty Museum. The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. “If our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,” she says, “the medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.” Larisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes’ unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don’t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the “monstrous peoples” as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade. This work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. “Scholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery. There has now been a revision of that view,” says Larisa. “These manuscripts provide an interesting glimpse into how late-medieval Europeans made sense of their world, including...
