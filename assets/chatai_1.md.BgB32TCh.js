That possibility has been created by the discovery of a new class of insect repellant made in the laboratory of Vanderbilt Professor of Biological Sciences and Pharmacology Laurence Zwiebel and reported this week in the online Early Edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.      \\"It wasn't something we set out to find,\\" said David Rinker, a graduate student who performed the study in collaboration with graduate student Gregory Pask and post-doctoral fellow Patrick Jones. \\"It was an anomaly that we noticed in our tests.\\"      The tests were conducted as part of a major interdisciplinary research project to develop new ways to control the spread of malaria by disrupting a mosquito's sense of smell supported by the Grand Challenges in Global Health Initiative funded by the Foundation for the NIH through a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.      \\"It's too soon to determine whether this specific compound can act as the basis of a commercial product,\\" Zwiebel cautioned. \\"But it is the first of its kind and, as such, can be used to develop other similar compounds that have characteristics appropriate for commercialization.\\"      The discovery of this new class of repellant is based on insights that scientists have gained about the basic nature of the insect's sense of smell in the last few years. Although the mosquito's olfactory system is housed in its antennae, 10 years ago biologists thought that it worked in the same way at the molecular level as it does in mammals. A family of special proteins called odorant receptors, or ORs, sits on the surface of nerve cells in the nose of mammals and in the antennae of mosquitoes. When these receptors come into contact with smelly molecules, they trigger the nerves signaling the detection of specific odors.      In the last few years, however, scientists have been surprised to learn that the olfactory system of mosquitoes and other insects is fundamentally different. In the insect system, conventional ORs do not act autonomously. Instead, they form a complex with a unique co-receptor (called Orco) that is also required to detect odorant molecules. ORs are spread all over the antennae and each responds to a different odor. To function, however, each OR must be connected to an Orco.      \\"Think of an OR as a microphone that can detect a single frequency,\\" Zwiebel said. \\"On her antenna the mosquito has dozens of types of these microphones, each tuned to a specific frequency. Orco acts as the switch in each microphone that tells the brain when there is a signal. When a mosquito smells an odor, the microphone tuned to that smell will turn \\"on\\" its Orco switch. The other microphones remain off. However, by stimulating Orco directly we can turn them all on at once. This would effectively overload the mosquito's sense of smell and shut down her ability to find blood.\\"      Because the researchers couldn't predict what chemicals might modulate OR-Orco complexes, they decided to \\"throw the kitchen sink\\" at the problem. Through their affiliation with Vanderbilt's Institute of Chemical Biology, they gained access to Vanderbilt's high throughput screening facility, a technology intended for the drug discovery process, not for the screening of insect ORs.      Jones used genetic engineering techniques to insert mosquito odorant receptors into the human embryonic kidney cells used in the screening process. Rinker tested these cells against a commercial library of 118,000 small molecules normally used in drug development. They expected to find, and did find, a number of compounds that triggered a response in the conventional mosquito ORs they were screening, but they were surprised to find one compound that consistently triggered OR-Orco complexes, leading them to conclude that they had discovered the first molecule that directly stimulates the Orco co-receptor. They have named the compound VUAA1.      Although it is not an odorant molecule, the researchers determined that VUAA1 activates insect OR-Orco complexes in a manner similar to a typical odorant molecule. Jones also verified that mosquitoes respond to exposure to VUAA1, a crucial step in demonstrating that VUAA1 can affect a mosquito's behavior.      \\"If a compound like VUAA1 can activate every mosquito OR at once, then it could overwhelm the insect's sense of smell, creating a repellant effect akin to stepping onto an elevator with someone wearing too much perfume, except this would be far worse for the mosquito,\\" Jones said.      The researchers have just begun behavioral studies with the compound. In preliminary tests with mosquitoes, they have found that VUAA1 is thousands of times more effective than DEET.      They have also established that the compound stimulates the OR-Orco complexes of flies, moths and ants. As a result, \\"VUAA1 opens the door for the development of an entirely new class of agents, which could be used not only to disrupt disease vectors, but also the nuisance insects in your backyard or the agricultural pests in your crops,\\" Jones said.      Many questions must be answered before VUAA1 can be considered for commercial applications. Zwiebel's team is currently working with researchers in Vanderbilt's Drug Discovery Program to pare away the parts of VUAA1 that don't contribute to its activity. Once that is done, they will begin testing its toxicity.      Vanderbilt University has filed for a patent on this class of compounds and is talking with potential corporate licensees interested in incorporating them into commercial products, with special focus on development of products to reduce the spread of malaria in the developing world. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Researchers at Vanderbilt University have discovered a new class of insect repellent that is thousands of times more effective than DEET, the active ingredient in most commercial mosquito repellents.

They are extremely small and have an electric charge of -1. All atoms have the same number of electrons as protons.   Choices:  - nuclei and neutrons  - photons and protons  - electrons and neutrons  - electrons and protons   A: Answer:","output":"The detailed answer to the given question is that all atoms have equal numbers of electrons and protons. This is evident in the provided paragraph, which states that \\"All atoms have the same number of electrons as protons.\\" Atoms are the building blocks of matter and are composed of three main types of particles: electrons, protons, and neutrons. Electrons are negatively charged particles (-1 electric charge) that orbit the nucleus of the atom. In contrast, protons are positively charged particles (+1 electric charge) and are found within the nucleus, along with neutrons, which have no charge. The number of electrons and protons determines the atomic number and chemical properties of an atom. The atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom, and it also equals the number of electrons surrounding the nucleus in a neutral atom. The balance between the negatively charged electrons and positively charged protons is what gives an atom its overall neutral charge. In the context of the provided paragraph and given options, the correct answer is that all atoms have equal numbers of electrons and protons. Other options such as nuclei and neutrons, photons and protons, or electrons and neutrons are not correct in this context. The number of neutrons can vary within the same atomic element, giving rise to isotopes, whereas photons are particles of light and are not components of an atom."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If \\"A woman in a restaurant talking.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A woman is ordering food.\\"?","output":"The statement \\"A woman in a restaurant talking\\" simply provides a scene: there is a woman in a restaurant having a conversation. By itself, it does not provide enough information to determine the subject of her conversation or her actions.  To state that \\"A woman is ordering food\\" as a logical follow-up, we would require more information or context to connect the two statements accurately. For instance, if we had additional information such as \\"A woman in a restaurant talking to a waiter\\" or \\"A woman in a restaurant looking at the menu and discussing her preferences,\\" it would be more reasonable to infer that she might be ordering food. However, there are many potential reasons for a woman to be talking in a restaurant. She could be engaged in a variety of conversations or activities unrelated to food ordering, such as: 1. Discussing business with a colleague. 2. Having a casual conversation with a friend or family member. 3. Talking to a restaurant staff member regarding her reservation, dietary restrictions, or other inquiries. 4. Speaking with the restaurant manager about a concern, compliment, or complaint. 5. Engaging in a phone call or participating in an online meeting. Additionally, considering the fact that restaurants can host various events or gatherings, a woman could be talking during a celebration, announcement, or presentation. In these cases as well, it would not automatically imply that she is ordering food.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\".  Question: Why does the dead body weigh so much? Movie plot title: Imprint Movie plot: Christopher (Billy Drago), a Victorian era American journalist, is traveling through Japan looking for Komomo (Itô), a lost girlfriend whom he had promised to rescue from prostitution and bring to America. He travels by boat with several handfarms (Shihô Harumi, Magy, Shin'ichi Tokuhara and Takao Handa). The boat hits something, but it's not a rock - it's the dead body of a woman (Miyuki Konno). The boatman (Hiroshi Kuze) says that the body weighs a ton, so he deduces she was pregnant. When he turns her over, we can see that she was heavily pregnant. Finally landing on an island populated solely by whores and their masters, he is solicited by a syphilitic tout (Yamada). She claims no knowledge of Komomo (Michié), but Christopher has to spend the night, requesting the company of a girl (Youki Kudoh) lurking back in the shadows, who joins him in his room.Disfigured and disturbed, the girl claims a closer connection with the dead than the living. She tells him that Komomo was there, but hanged herself after her love never came for her. Distraught, Christopher seeks solace in sake. Falling asleep, he requests a bedtime story. The girl recounts her past her mother, a midwife, was forced to sell her to a brothel after her father died, and eventually she wound up on the island. Komomo was the most popular girl there, making the others jealous. When the Madam's jade ring was stolen, Komomo was tortured to confess. After suffering hideously underarms burned, needles driven under fingernails and into gums she killed herself in shame and torment.Christopher refuses to believe the girl's story, and he pleads for the whole truth. The girl starts again, in the second telling, her family is no longer happy nor loving; her father was an alcoholic, her mother an abortionist. She was taken in by a Buddhist priest, who, presumably, molested her and inspired an obsession with hell. Her father never died of lung disease she beat him to death for raping her. Again she tells of being sold into prostitution, but gives a new version... Answer:","output":"The dead body in the movie \\"Imprint\\" weighs so much because the woman was heavily pregnant. The boatman deduces her pregnancy after noticing the weight and seeing her condition upon turning her over. This added weight is due to the developing fetus and the changes that occur within a woman's body during pregnancy, such as increased blood volume and amniotic fluid."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How is chocolate made?","output":"No, the two questions are not the same, as they address different aspects of the chocolate-making process. Let me explain the difference between the two questions and provide detailed information for each. Question 1: How are chocolate raw materials obtained and how is chocolate made? This question is asking for information about two distinct stages in the chocolate-making process. First, it looks at how the raw materials for chocolate are obtained, and secondly, it delves into the actual process of making chocolate. 1. Obtaining raw materials: The primary raw material for making chocolate is the cacao bean, which is the seed of the cacao tree (Theobroma cacao). Cacao trees are grown in tropical regions, with the majority of production taking place in West Africa, Central and South America, and Southeast Asia. Here is the process of obtaining raw materials for chocolate: a. Harvesting: Cacao pods, which contain cacao beans, are harvested by hand from the cacao tree. This is usually done twice a year during the main and mid-crop harvests. b. Fermentation: The cacao beans are removed from the pods and placed in fermentation boxes or heaps, covered with banana leaves. The fermentation process, which usually takes about five to seven days, is vital for developing the chocolate's flavor profile. c. Drying: After fermentation, the beans are spread out on drying racks or platforms and left to dry in the sun. The drying process ensures that the beans do not mold or rot. It can take up to a week for the cacao beans to dry, after which they are inspected and sorted. d. Roasting: Once the cacao beans have been dried and cleaned, they are roasted to bring out the characteristic chocolate flavor. Roasting temperatures and times vary, depending on the desired flavor profile. 2. Making chocolate: The process of making chocolate involves several steps that transform the prepared cacao beans into a delicious final product. a. Grinding: Roasted cacao beans are ground into a paste called chocolate liquor. The grinding process generates heat, which melts the cocoa butter present in the beans, resulting in a smooth liquid. b. Separation: The chocolate liquor is further processed using pressing machines to separate the cocoa solids from the cocoa butter. This separation results in two products: cocoa powder and cocoa butter. c. Conching: Chocolate makers then mix cocoa butter, cocoa powder, and other ingredients such as sugar, milk powder (for milk chocolate), and vanilla, in a conching machine. This machine refines the texture and flavor of the chocolate, resulting in a smoother product. d. Tempering: The chocolate mixture is then tempered, which involves heating and cooling it to specific temperatures. This process ensures that the chocolate forms the right crystal structure, giving it a shiny appearance and a nice snap when broken. e. Molding: Finally, the tempered chocolate is poured into molds, where it cools and hardens into the desired shape. The chocolate can also be made into various products like chocolate bars, truffles, or confections. Question 2: How is chocolate made? This question only asks for information about the process of making chocolate, starting from the point where the raw materials have already been obtained. In this case, you can focus solely on the steps mentioned in the \\"making chocolate\\" section above (Steps 2a-2e). In summary, while the first question is looking for comprehensive information about the entire chocolate production process from raw material sourcing to the final product, the second question is focused on the specific steps involved in making chocolate from the obtained raw materials."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Losing weight overall can cut down on belly fat, and make your hips look bigger. To lose weight, the first step is a healthy diet.  Your diet should be primarily plant-based. Fruits, vegetables, and whole grains should make up the bulk of your diet. Go for brown rice over white rice, and whole wheat breads over white varieties. Stick to lean forms of protein, like fish and poultry, and low fat dairy products. For example, go for salmon for dinner instead of steak. Sugar can contribute to weight gain overall, so look into cutting back on sugar in your diet. Sugary beverages can be a big culprit, as many people fail to think about liquid calories in their diet.  Avoid sugary beverages like soda, specialty latte drinks, and alcoholic beverages including cocktails, wine, beer, and wine coolers. Drink plenty of water instead and opt for unsweetened beverages like unsweetened iced tea and club soda. You can even flavor water and other zero calorie beverages with lemon or lime juice. Read labels before making a purchase. Sugar is found in surprising places, like breads, yogurts, and pasta sauces. You should also look for words like fructose, dextrose, and maltose in the ingredients list. These are all names of added sugar. For women, strive to limit added sugar to 24 grams a day, which is about 6 teaspoons. For men, limit added sugar to 36 grams, which is about 9 teaspoons. Many times, you are eating more calories than you realize. Portion sizes, especially when eating out, can be quite large. Be conscientious of portion size.  Try to avoid going out to eat. When you do, split an entree with a friend to halve the calories. If a restaurant has a special menu of low calorie foods, try ordering off of that.  Be aware of how much food you should eat at home. One serving of carbohydrates is about the size of a hockey puck. An ounce of dairy is about the size of six dice. A serving of protein should be no bigger than a deck of cards.  It can also help to eat slowly. Your body will feel more satisfied, and you will realize you're full quicker. It can be helpful to keep a record of your eating habits, any weight loss you have, and any inches you lose off of your waist. This can help you stay on track and see what days of the week you're likely to slip up. It can also keep you motivated to have a running log of your progress to look at each day. You should also be sure to include other factors that can affect weight loss. For example, note things like your stress level, your sleep schedule, and your daily exercise.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Almost every child is scared of something, from monsters in the cupboard to dogs in the park. But the fact that such fears are common and normal doesn't mean they can be taken lightly. Kids experience fears and phobias  much more strongly than adults. And the influence of the fear can be physical as well as psychological  . It can build up so they almost seem scared of everything--a kind of childhood anxiety. Dr. Creswell says: \\"Your child may always seem to expect the worst to happen and lack confidence in his or her ability to deal with any challenge.\\" So don't make the same old mistake of treating them as if they're silly for being a\\"scaredy cat\\". Handling the fears is essential. Children can be born nervous and, if you have such a baby, you'll tend to prevent them from getting worried. So if they fear dogs, you'll keep them away from dogs, but in fact that can just confirm to the child that dogs are scary. What is worse, keeping your child away from what they fear can turn that feeling into a phobia. Instead, you should encourage them to get in touch with the thing they fear, in a safe and supportive environment. Dr. Andy Field, a researcher of childhood fears, says: \\"You shouldn't force, for example, a dog anxious child to go up to a dog. But you can approach it yourself, show them there is nothing to be afraid of, stroke( ) it, and talk about the dog being friendly. Once your child dares to stroke a dog-one that's good with children, of course---then you should encourage them to carry on until they feel calmer, and reward them for'being brave'.\\" Options: A make the same old mistake B overcome them by themselves C experience the worst of things D grow up lacking self-confidence Answer: D grow up lacking self-confidence Question:","output":"What does Dr. Creswell imply may happen to a child if their fears are not properly addressed and managed?

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the subject of the painting that Hans Hieronymus Imhoff gave a lukewarm description for? , can you please find it?   After the painter's death in 1528, the portraits were held by his brother, and then his brother's widow before they passed into the collection of Willibald Imhoff, a grandson of Dürer's friend Willibald Pirckheimer. Inventories from the Imhoff collection from 1573–74, 1580 and 1588 list both panels. The next surviving Imhoff inventory, of 1628, again lists the mother's portrait, but it disappears after mention in the 1633–58 account books of Hans Hieronymus Imhoff, after which its whereabouts became unknown. Dürer expert Matthias Mende described the missing portrait of Barbara Holper as \\"among the most severe losses in the Dürer oeuvre\\". In 1977, art historian Lotte Brand Philip proposed that Unknown Woman in a Coif, held by the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg, was the original portrait of Barbara Holper. The Nuremberg panel was previously thought to have originated from a member of Wolgemut's workshop, a Franconian artist in his circle, or the anonymous Mainz painter Master W. B. Brand Philip's attribution was based on striking similarities in composition and its shared tone, theme and size with the father panel at the Uffizi. In both works the sitters are holding rosary beads, and Dürer attentively describes their hands. Both portraits show the sitter in the same pose, against a similarly coloured background. Both are lit from the upper left. The boards are identically cut in width and depth, although 3 cm was removed from the left edge of Barbara's panel. Brand Philip noted the similarities between the panel and Dürer's 1514 charcoal drawing Portrait of the Artist's Mother at the Age of 63. Fedja Anzelewsky agreed with the attribution, noting that both portraits bear, on their reverse, the catalogue number recorded in the Imhoff inventories, as well as \\"precisely the same design of masses of dark clouds\\".Anzelewsky speculated that the father's portrait, which was not listed in the 1628 Imhoff inventory, had been broken off and sold to Rudolph II of Austria.

Examine your apartment for damage. Make sure your appliances are functioning properly. Talk to your landlord about any damage or problems you find. Article:","output":"Title: A Comprehensive Guide to Preparing for Your Move-out Inspection: Practical Tips for a Smooth Transition Introduction Moving out of a rented apartment can be an overwhelming task, especially when dealing with the pressure of ensuring that your living space is clean, undamaged and fit for the next tenant. Navigating the move-out process can be time-consuming, but a little planning and organization can help you avoid unpleasant surprises and additional charges. In this article, we will discuss practical tips on how to prepare for your move-out inspection effectively and ensure a smooth transition to your new home. Step 1: Review the Move-out Policy in Your Lease Before you start planning your move, it's crucial to review the move-out policy outlined in your lease agreement. The lease is a legally binding document that specifies your responsibilities as a tenant and the expectations of your landlord at the end of your tenancy. Carefully read through the policy to understand aspects like: - Notice period: the time frame within which you should inform your landlord about your intention to move out - Cleaning requirements: details about the expected level of cleanliness in the apartment - Repair responsibilities: the extent of your liability for any damages or repairs that might be required - Inspection timeline: when the move-out inspection will be conducted and how much notice will be given. Being informed about these crucial points will provide you with a clear picture of your obligations and help you in planning your move efficiently. Step 2: Examine Your Apartment for Dirt Now that you have reviewed your move-out policy, it's time to thoroughly examine your apartment for cleanliness. Remember that leaving a rental unit in pristine condition is not only crucial for getting your security deposit back but is also the best practice for fostering a positive relationship with your landlord. Pay attention to the following areas: - Walls: Check for stains, scuffs and marks on walls and baseboards and clean them using appropriate cleaning materials - Floors: Vacuum the carpets, sweep and mop the floors, ensuring all dirt, stains and crumbs are removed - Kitchen: Clean the countertops, empty and clean the cabinets and shelves, and scrub the sink - Bathroom: Remove any mold, mildew or soap scum, clean the toilet, bathtub, shower and sink, and sanitize the floor - Windows: Clean the glass, window sills and window tracks. Step 3: Examine Your Apartment for Damage After addressing the cleaning aspect, conduct a thorough examination of your apartment for any damages. Look for issues like chipped paint, broken fixtures, damaged appliances or cracked tiles that might have occurred during your tenancy. If you find any damage, make a list and take photos for your records. You should also consult your lease to determine whether you are responsible for repairing the damages or if it falls under your landlord's responsibilities. Step 4: Ensure Your Appliances Are Functioning Properly During your tenure in the apartment, appliances may experience wear and tear or malfunction. Before moving out, confirm that all the appliances provided by your landlord are in good working condition. This includes checking the refrigerator, oven, washer, dryer, dishwasher and any other appliances that might be part of your rental agreement. If you identify any issues, repair them yourself or talk to your landlord to determine the best course of action. Step 5: Talk to Your Landlord About Any Damage or Problems Once you have inspected your apartment and identified any possible problems or damages, it's essential to communicate your findings with your landlord. Transparent communication will allow both parties to discuss amicable solutions and prevent misunderstandings. Provide them with copies of any photos or documentation that you have taken during your inspection and explain the nature of the problem. Your landlord will appreciate your honesty and proactive approach, which will go a long way in ensuring a smooth move-out process. Conclusion Preparing for a move-out inspection is a crucial aspect of transitioning from one apartment to another. By reviewing your lease, conducting thorough checks for dirt and damages, ensuring appliances are functioning properly, and maintaining open communication with your landlord, you will pave the way for a positive and stress-free moving experience."},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

As the nation continues to grieve for the six adults and 20 children taken too soon in the Newtown, Connecticut, school shooting, a hero from another generation has slipped peacefully into the pages of history. There were many who knew Sen. Dan Inouye, a Democrat and Medal of Honor recipient from Hawaii who passed away Monday, better than we did. But we had the good fortune of sitting with him this past summer, interviewing him and hearing some of the remarkable stories from his life in America's service. The portrait that emerged was that of a man of courage, character, and, perhaps above all, a singular spirit of peace and good will that was forged, paradoxically, amid some of the most horrendous carnage of the Second World War. News: Hawaii's Daniel Inouye, Senate's second longest-serving member, dead at 88. Some of Inouye's deeds -- his valor serving on the German front in one of America's most decorated (and heavily wounded) units, his Herculean political efforts on behalf of his home state -- have been well remarked. What we were especially struck by was his quiet, sagelike humanity. There was his story, for example, of the day during the war when he came upon a German soldier who appeared to be preparing to kill him. The German, as Inouye told it, put his hand into his shirt, and Inouye, thinking he was reaching for his weapon, \\"smashed him in the face.\\" As the man hit the ground, his hand fell out of his shirt, revealing photographs -- the soldier's wife, his kids. \\"So help me, up until that moment, I looked upon Germans as enemies, period,\\" said Inouye, who had by then killed many enemy soldiers already. \\"From that moment, I looked upon him as a father, son, uncle, boyfriend. He was human. And it's not easy to kill.\\" It was, he said, what he always told people when they expressed disbelief that he, a decorated veteran, could stand up against the war in Iraq. \\"You've got to convince me before we go to war,\\" he maintained. \\"You would never forget running over a dog -- the bump. If you don't forget that, how can you forget killing a human being?\\" To hear Inouye talk was to sit beside a still, fathomless pool -- he spoke with a measured calm and wisdom that made clear how deep the dignity beneath it ran. In that way, he called to mind an echo of former Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield -- of whom, Inouye said, \\"If there was a mentor, it was him.\\" And he carried Mansfield's stoic ability to forge consensus and compromise with him, far into a legislative era known for its strident opposites. Of his 12 subcommittees, Inouye told us in July, \\"Nine of them have reported out their bills almost unanimously. About six were unanimous -- 30-0. The others were 29-1, 28-2. ... That's this month. It can be done! ... And 30-0 includes (Senate Minority Leader Mitch) McConnell!\\" His secret was deceptively straightforward: a steady practice of simple gestures -- sitting with senators who had objections, calling a senior Republican \\"vice chairman\\" instead of \\"ranking member\\" (\\"I hate that word 'ranking' -- it's something like 'stink'!\\"), not speaking ill of anyone to the press. \\"It might take some patience, but when I found out that you were pissed about (a) program, I'd sit down with you and talk about it,\\" he told us. \\"Little things like that make a difference.\\" It was a basic humanity and a largeness of vision that Inouye extended to individuals from all backgrounds, born not only out of his experiences seeing his own people -- Japanese-Americans -- vilified and interned during World War II (Inouye himself signed up as soon as the U.S. government lifted its ban on American-born Japanese enlistments), but from his own crucibles in the war. Describing the injury that cost him his right arm and very nearly his life, Inouye told us of being taken to the Army hospital, of being initially counted a hopeless case, of having his arm amputated without anesthesia, of ultimately receiving 17 blood transfusions to stay alive. Of those 17 transfusions, he explained:. \\"That made a little difference in my outlook on life. In our last battle, the regiment was attached to the 92nd Division -- all African-American. Hospitals were run by the 92nd Division, and in those days, I don't know about the other hospitals, but in the one I was in, (the blood) came in a glass bottle, with tape -- donated by so and so, private, 92nd Division. So you know he's African-American. Well I got 17 pints. \\"If it weren't for (the 92nd), I wouldn't be here. The war did a lot to change your ideas. I looked upon (people of color), as I do today, as brothers. What else can I do? After all, I've got the same blood.\\" Throughout its history, the nation has been blessed to have men like Inouye -- reserved, unboastful men, whose actions show the deep reservoir of quiet honor from which they draw their strength. Who show the courage that Hemingway called \\"grace under pressure.\\" When he was first brought to the Army field hospital after sustaining the wounds that would claim his arm, Inouye related, \\"The doctors looked at me; they're mumbling among themselves,\\" he recalled. \\"Two minutes later a chaplain comes up -- opening words: 'God loves you.' \\"I said: 'I know that. I love him too,\\" he recounted with a chuckle. \\"'But I'm not ready to meet him yet!'\\" No one can know the ways of the Lord, but we would be surprised if he wasn't happy to meet Dan Inouye today. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Zuckerman and David Gergen. Write highlights for this article.","output":"The passing of Sen. Dan Inouye, a Democrat and Medal of Honor recipient from Hawaii, marks the loss of a hero from a different generation. His actions during World War II and his political efforts on behalf of his state are well-known, but his quiet, sagelike humanity made him a powerful presence. He was able to forge consensus and compromise in a divisive legislative environment, extending basic humanity and largeness of vision to people from all backgrounds. The courage, resilience, and dignity that Sen. Inouye displayed throughout his life is a testament to the quiet honor from which he drew his strength, and his memory leaves a lasting impact on the hearts of many."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Given the background: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.  and the situation: Two identical planets, Norlon and Bothar, have been discovered in a neighboring galaxy of ours. These two planets have the same type of atmosphere as Earth and are extremely similar to Earth in terms of topography and even species of animals that live on them.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Hillary Clinton said to consider delay of 2016 campaign announcement Hillary Rodham Clinton (Jack Gruber, USA TODAY) Hillary Rodham Clinton may be pushing off the formal announcement of her likely presidential campaign to sometime this summer. Politico reports the former secretary of State “is strongly considering delaying the formal launch” of her campaign from April until July. The story cites unnamed Democrats and advisers. A Democrat familiar with Clinton’s thinking said: ‘She doesn’t feel under any pressure, and they see no primary challenge on the horizon. If you have the luxury of time, you take it.’ The 2016 presidential race seems to have gotten underway already, with several potential candidates in early stages of organizing. But none of the major candidates has officially launched a 2016 campaign. Republicans Jeb Bush, Chris Christie and Scott Walker have created committees that would assist in fundraising and serve as vehicles to promote their ideas. Mitt Romney, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Rick Perry are among the Republicans who have brought on staff in anticipation of White House bids. On the Democratic side, Jim Webb announced the formation of a presidential exploratory committee. But the former Virginia senator is considered a long shot for the nomination, with early public opinion polls all showing Clinton far ahead of any potential Democratic rivals. By way of comparison, President Obama formally launched his re-election drive in April 2011 by sending an e-mail to supporters and posting a video on a campaign website. Romney did his official kick-off in June 2011, with a speech before supporters in New Hampshire. For her first presidential race, Clinton announced she was “in to win” with a message posted January 2007 on her website. Summary:","output":"Hillary Clinton is reportedly considering delaying the formal announcement of her likely presidential campaign to sometime this summer.

Question: Given the background: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease.  and the situation: Dr. Jones studied 2 groups of people to see the effects of aging on humans. Group A had people under 35 years old in it, while group B had people over 65.  Answer the following question: Which group had a smaller chance of developing cardiovascular diseases? Answer:","output":"Based on the background information provided, it can be concluded that Group A, which consists of people under 35 years old, has a smaller chance of developing cardiovascular diseases as compared to Group B, comprising of people over 65 years old. During late adulthood, individuals experience an increased risk of developing various health issues, including cardiovascular diseases and cancer. As people age, their bodily functions tend to decline, including strength, stamina, immune system efficiency, and sensory perceptions. These declines contribute to a higher susceptibility to various illnesses, with common diseases like the flu potentially becoming more serious and life-threatening. In contrast, younger individuals, such as those in Group A, have stronger immune systems, better physical strength and capacity, and are generally healthier in various aspects. Consequently, they are at a lower risk for developing cardiovascular diseases in comparison to their older counterparts in Group B. Furthermore, older adults like those in Group B are more likely to develop conditions such as arthritis and Alzheimer's disease. This information further emphasizes the differences in the general health status of the two age groups being studied by Dr. Jones. In summary, Group A, with people under 35 years old, has a smaller chance of developing cardiovascular diseases compared to Group B, which consists of individuals over 65 years old due to the physiological changes and increased risk of health complications that occur during late adulthood."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A group of model-caliber San Francisco women who have been friends since elementary school are suddenly being threatened and attacked by someone sending them bizarre Valentine's Day cards. Who is the killer and why is the killer after them?  My rating will often change on subsequent viewings of a film--sometimes slightly up, sometimes slightly down. However, I can't remember another film where my rating has changed as drastically as it has for Valentine. The first time I watched it, upon its theatrical release, I thought it was pretty awful--I gave it a 4 out of 10, the equivalent of an \\"F\\" letter grade. Watching it for a second time last night, I can't remember what the heck I didn't like about it. I can only assume that maybe I was really in the wrong mood to watch it, or maybe I just didn't get it. In any event, I loved it this time, giving it a 9 out of 10, or an \\"A\\". It might sound ridiculous saying I didn't get a film like this, but there is something to get. Valentine is almost a comedy/horror. Director Jamie Blanks, who was also responsible for 1998's Urban Legend, takes the stereotypical teen horror formula that became so popular in the late 1990s in the wake of Scream (1996) and pushes most of the elements up a notch, making Valentine intentionally cheesy/campy almost to the point of absurdity (where absurdism is a positive stylistic term). On top of that, he gives us a film imbued with humorous commentary on romantic relationships. The humor is unusual in that it has the same exaggeratedly campy tone as the teen horror aspects. Most of the situations in the film, and the modus operandi of the villain, humorous or not, are tied in to the Valentine's Day theme. Many viewers will likely subtract points from the film for its various cliché-rooted but implausible scenarios and plot developments. However, in light of the above, the film is intentionally clichéd, implausible and ludicrous. It's as if Blanks is attempting (and mostly succeeding) to transcend the typical teen slasher by mocking/spoofing the conventions of the genre while also satirizing eros. That's the attraction to the irony of basing a horror film on Valentine's Day. It's an incongruity that is cleverly woven throughout the film, and that is itself at the heart of the slasher genre, making it prime fodder for Valentine's extravagant lampooning. Scream had a similar aim with its horror material, but the twist there was that the film was \\"self-aware\\". Valentine's Day is intentionally not self-aware; the viewer has to rely on contextual clues for satire. Lest some think I'm \\"reading too much\\" into the film, it's worthwhile to note that Blanks said in interviews that he \\"didn't want to just do another slasher film after Urban Legend\\" and producer Dylan Sellers said he wanted to do something \\"more adult\\". Other viewers may dislike the fact that Valentine's Day differs so much from its putative source material, the novel of the same name by Tom Savage. The novel's characters, setting and plot are very different from the film. Sellers has said, \\"While it was a fine book, I didn't think it was the right story for a film\\". So instead the novel, which is much dryer and more serious in tone, was used as a launching pad, a motif to create variations on for a horror/thriller story centered on Valentine's Day. While those facts won't help purists familiar with the book like the film, it's helpful to understand why the film has its divergent plot and attitude. It's probably better to look at the film as an independent entity with a similar theme. Blanks' direction is impeccable visually. Valentine's Day has a lush look throughout, with complex, deep colors, interesting sets, and good staging. Blanks is admirable for keeping his villain and attack scenes not too dark, with clearly conveyed action. He also directs his actors with aplomb, catalyzing often slyly humorous performances. David Boreanaz, as Adam Carr, is involved in many of the funniest moments. While Valentine's Day is no masterpiece, it's a very good horror/thriller film that seems strongly prone to misconceptions. If you watch it expecting something more tongue-in-cheek you may find yourself appreciating it a lot more. Choose your answer. What is the sentiment of this review?

News article: James Foley’s Brother: The U.S. Could Have Done More for Jim      By Liz Goodwin      The brother of American journalist James Foley said Friday morning that the U.S. government could have done more to attempt to free his brother and other American hostages from the Islamic militant group ISIL.      “There’s more that could have been done directly on Jim’s behalf,” Michael Foley, 38, told Yahoo Global News Anchor Katie Couric in an exclusive interview near his parents’ home in Dover, New Hampshire. “I really, really hope that Jim’s death pushes us to take another look at our approach to terrorist and hostage negotiation.”      Foley, a 40-year-old journalist who was covering the Syrian conflict for GlobalPost, was kidnapped nearly two years ago near the Syria-Turkey border. ISIL, also called ISIS, released a grisly video of his beheading Tuesday, claiming it killed him in retaliation for U.S. airstrikes in the region.      But another issue was money. The group had also captured French and Spanish journalists, but freed them after their governments paid ransoms through intermediaries. The U.S. government refused to negotiate or pay the group on behalf of Foley and other American captives. ISIL emailed Michael Foley and demanded 100 million euros—a sum he called “ridiculous”—for his brother’s release.      “I just feel strongly that more can be done moving forward,” Michael Foley said.      The Obama administration said this week that it had sent a special military operations force to try to rescue Foley and the other Americans over the summer, but that the mission failed. “I’d like to think it did happen, but I certainly wasn’t aware of it,” Foley said of the failed mission.      ISIL has threatened to kill another captured American journalist, Steven Sotloff, next. Michael Foley said he hopes the U.S. government does more on his behalf, including considering trading prisoners held in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.      “I don't believe ISIL can be contained — containment is not a strategy. We need to recognize that they are a threat and we need to deal with them,” Michael Foley said.      Michael Foley and his sister Katie, 26, told Couric that condolences have come pouring in from all around the world. Pope Francis called their family yesterday, telling them that James Foley’s death was an act of martyrdom.      The family briefly had hope that they would be able to negotiate for his release, after an intermediary made contact with ISIL on their behalf. But then the U.S. government began bombing ISIL earlier this month. On August 12, ISIL sent Foley’s parents a “chilling” email saying their son would die to pay for the airstrikes, according to Michael Foley. “I don’t understand where that type of hate could come from,” Katie Foley said.      The family believes that Foley volunteered to be the first American to be executed. “You can see from the clips from the video that he wasn’t afraid,” Michael Foley said.      European journalists who were captured by ISIL but later freed told Foley’s family that the journalist made a makeshift board game out of objects they found and even taught his fellow captives Spanish as a way to keep hope alive.      The U.S. government says they will hunt down and punish Foley’s killers.      “We will be relentless,” President Barack Obama said this week. “When people harm Americans anywhere, we do what’s necessary to see that justice is done.”      Foley’s friends have set up a scholarship fund in his name at Marquette University, where he graduated in 1996, for disadvantaged students.      Watch the Full Interview: ||||| share tweet pin email      James Foley's parents, John and Diane Foley, say that before their son was killed by ISIS they had hoped they could negotiate with the terrorist group, and promise that their son's legacy will live on.      \\"Jim's strength and love was the answer to prayer...Jim will live on,\\" the Foleys told TODAY's Tamron Hall Friday.      ISIS militants have claimed responsibility for executing the American photojournalist. The group sent Foley's parents an email on Aug. 12, stating that their son would be \\"executed.\\" The email was the first communication the Foleys had received from their son's captors since December of 2013, which initially left them hopeful they could find a way to bring him home safely.            Today John and Diane Foley      \\"I actually was excited to see an email despite the conclusion that they would execute Jim,'' his father said. \\"We underestimated that point. I did not realize how brutal they were, and I actually hoped we could engage in negotiations with them if they were willing to send any sort of communication because we had none prior.\\"      A French journalist who was released in April and shared a cell with Foley spoke about his courage and noted how he was treated more harshly because he was American.      \\"Jim's courage and particularly his compassion and love in that box, which they called it, was an answer to prayer,'' his mother said. \\"We had so many people praying for Jimmy. We had begged for prayer, but we didn't need to.\\"            The family has received a call from Pope Francis comforting them for their loss.      \\"Pope Francis was so dear because he is grieving himself having just lost three members of his family and (with) his nephew critically ill,'' Diane said. \\"Here in the midst of his tremendous grief, he took the time to call. He was just so kind.\\"      Follow TODAY.com writer Scott Stump on Twitter and Google+.                               ||||| Somewhere in the desert of eastern Syria, a militant from the Islamic State beheaded the American journalist James Foley this week. The killer and his terrorist group are responsible for Foley’s death. They should be the focus of public anger.      But Foley’s execution is also a chilling wake-up call for American and European policymakers, as well as U.S. news outlets and aid organizations. It is the clearest evidence yet of how vastly different responses to kidnappings by U.S. and European governments save European hostages but can doom the Americans. Hostages and their families realize this fully — even if the public does not.      “I wish I could have the hope of freedom and seeing my family once again, but that ship has sailed,” Foley said moments before he was killed in a craven video released by the militant group on Tuesday. “I guess, all in all, I wish I wasn’t American.”      Foley clearly spoke under duress. But his regret at being an American captive, real or not, reflected grim fact.      This spring, four French and two Spanish journalists held hostage by the Islamic State extremists were freed — after the French and Spanish governments paid ransoms through intermediaries.      The U.S. government refused to negotiate or pay a ransom in Foley’s case or for any other American captives — including my own abduction by the Taliban five years ago.      With the help of an Afghan journalist abducted with me, I was lucky enough to escape. But today Foley is dead and the Islamic State militants now say Steven Sotloff, a journalist for Time magazine whom the group also captured, will be killed if the United States does not stop bombing its fighters in Iraq.      There are no easy answers in kidnapping cases. The United States cannot allow terrorist groups to control its foreign policy.      One clear lesson that has emerged in recent years, however, is that security threats are more effectively countered by united American and European action. The divergent U.S. and European approach to abductions fails to deter captors or consistently safeguard victims.      Last month, a New York Times investigation found that al Qaeda and its direct affiliates had received at least 125 million in revenue from kidnappings since 2008 — primarily from European governments. In the last year alone, they received 66 million.      “Kidnapping hostages is an easy spoil,” Nasser al-Wuhayshi, the leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, wrote in a 2012 letter to the leader of an al Qaeda affiliate in North Africa, “which I may describe as a profitable trade and a precious treasure.”      Publicly, European governments deny making these payments. But former diplomats told the Times that ransoms have been paid through intermediaries.      Kidnapping as a fundraising tactic is thriving and rates are going up. In 2003, a ransom of roughly 200,000 was paid for each captive, the newspaper found. Today, captors reap millions per captive.      Abductions have become so lucrative that al Qaeda leaders in Pakistan help oversee negotiations for affiliates. Militants groups spread across North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia are now following the same rough protocol.      Hostage-taking by extremist groups is now so pervasive that at least one major aid organization is not sending U.S. aid workers to areas where they might be abducted. Instead, they are sending citizens from European countries with governments that will pay ransoms.      The cases have taken on a grim pattern: Hostages are abducted, months pass with no news from the captors and a threatening video or email is then sent to families. In some cases, the militants ask that cases not be made public so ransom can be paid quietly.      This was the case in Foley’s tortuous, 21-month abduction. For the first 16 months after Foley was taken captive, his family had no information regarding his whereabouts. They learned he was alive from two Spanish journalists who were freed by the Islamic State in March after a ransom was paid.      In a subsequent email message, the captors instructed the family to keep the case quiet and not identify the Islamic State as the kidnappers. Fearing for Foley’s life, the family obeyed. Other American families with loved ones taken captive by militants have done the same.      Privately, the Foleys and other families have grown intensely frustrated with the failure of American officials to negotiate with the captors. U.S. government officials also refused to coordinate their response in any way with European governments.      In the days and weeks ahead, the Foley family will speak for themselves about their ordeal. But the payment of ransoms and abduction of foreigners must emerge from the shadows. It must be publicly debated. American and European policymakers should be forced to answer for their actions.      Foley believed that his government would help him, according to his family. In a message that was not made public, Foley said that he believed so strongly that Washington would help that he refused to allow his fellow American captives to not believe in their government.      A consistent response to kidnapping by the U.S. and Europe is desperately needed. The current haphazard approach is failing.      James Foley must not die in vain.

The shipbuilding industry is a sector that specializes in the design, construction, maintenance, and repair of various types of ships, including commercial, military, and special-purpose vessels. This industry plays a critical role in the global economy by contributing to international trade, defense, and tourism. When discussing the factors that could potentially impact the shipbuilding industry negatively, it is important to consider various economic, political, social, and environmental aspects. 1. Economic factors: The global economy can have a significant impact on the shipbuilding industry. If the world economy experiences a downturn or crisis, this can potentially lead to a reduction in demand for new ships, as well as a decrease in international trade. In turn, this would affect the revenue and profits of the companies operating in this sector. 2. Political factors: Government policies and regulation can also play a significant role in the functioning of the shipbuilding industry. For example, changes in trade policies can impact the demand for vessels, especially if countries impose restrictions on imports or exports. Similarly, fluctuations in defense budgets can affect the demand for military ships. Furthermore, international relations and conflicts can have a negative impact on the climate within which shipbuilding companies operate, potentially leading to decreased trade and increased insecurity. 3. Social factors: Tourism, another important contributor to the shipbuilding industry, can be influenced by social factors such as global pandemics, changing consumer preferences, or other issues that affect people's desire or ability to travel. A decline in tourism can result in reduced demand for passenger vessels, such as cruise ships and ferries. 4. Environmental factors: The shipbuilding industry must also contend with growing concern for the environment, including climate change and pollution. Regulations aimed at reducing emissions from ships or protecting marine ecosystems might require substantial investments in research and development, as well as costly updates to facilities and equipment. While these goals are necessary from an environmental perspective, they can also lead to increased costs for the shipbuilding industry in the short term. 5. Technological factors: The pace of technological change can also pose challenges for the shipbuilding industry. Companies must constantly adapt to new technologies, materials, and processes to stay competitive. For instance, the increasing focus on autonomous and electric vessels requires substantial investment in the development of new systems and infrastructures. This can put additional pressure on the industry to innovate rapidly while remaining economically viable. In conclusion, the shipbuilding industry can be significantly impacted by various factors such as economic, political, social, environmental, and technological influences. The phrase \\"Laivanrakennusteollisuus ei varmasti hyödy siitä\\" suggests that there is a factor or situation at hand that will certainly not benefit the industry. Considering the potential challenges discussed above, any of those factors (or a combination of them) may be responsible for negatively affecting the shipbuilding industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person who was executed by the federal government on June 11, 2001?  Social tensions were exacerbated by the revival of the Ku Klux Klan after 1915. The Tulsa Race Riot broke out in 1921, with whites attacking blacks. In one of the costliest episodes of racial violence in American history, sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 city blocks destroyed, 1.8 million in property damage, and a death toll estimated to be as high as 300 people. By the late 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had declined to negligible influence within the state.During the 1930s, parts of the state began suffering the consequences of poor farming practice. This period was known as the Dust Bowl, throughout which areas of Kansas, Texas, New Mexico and northwestern Oklahoma were hampered by long periods of little rainfall, strong winds, and abnormally high temperatures, sending thousands of farmers into poverty and forcing them to relocate to more fertile areas of the western United States. Over a twenty-year period ending in 1950, the state saw its only historical decline in population, dropping 6.9 percent as impoverished families migrated out of the state after the Dust Bowl. Soil and water conservation projects markedly changed practices in the state and led to the construction of massive flood control systems and dams; they built hundreds of reservoirs and man-made lakes to supply water for domestic needs and agricultural irrigation. By the 1960s, Oklahoma had created more than 200 lakes, the most in the nation.In 1995, Oklahoma City was the site of one of the most destructive acts of domestic terrorism in American history. The Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995, in which Timothy McVeigh detonated a large, crude explosive device outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killed 168 people, including 19 children. For his crime, McVeigh was executed by the federal government on June 11, 2001. His accomplice, Terry Nichols, is serving life in prison without parole for helping plan the attack and prepare the explosive.On May 31, 2016, several cities experienced record setting flooding.

As a dedicated and hardworking individual, Jason relies on coffee as an essential part of his daily routine to maximize his performance and stay alert, particularly during long hours of work or study. Leslie, on the other hand, either doesn't share the same affinity for coffee or may have other personal reasons or lifestyle choices that affect her decision not to consume it in the same manner as Jason. Perhaps Leslie might be more sensitive to caffeine and may experience adverse side effects such as increased anxiety, jitteriness, or insomnia. It could also be that Leslie prefers alternative methods or beverages to stay energized, like herbal teas or natural energy-boosting supplements. Furthermore, it's possible that Leslie's dietary preferences or restrictions limit her consumption of coffee. Those who follow specific diets, like paleo, keto, or vegan, might choose not to drink coffee due to the potential additional caloric intake from added sugars, creamers, and sweeteners, or the presence of animal-derived ingredients in certain additives. Leslie may also be aware of medical conditions such as acid reflux, which could be aggravated by coffee, or may simply not enjoy the taste or aroma of it. Additionally, Leslie might prioritize physical activity or regular breaks during the day to recharge and maintain her energy levels naturally, rather than relying on caffeine. This could be in the form of exercise, meditation, or engaging in a hobby to refresh her mind and body. In any case, Jason's decision to consume 4 cups of coffee every day stems from his belief that it's an effective way to boost his overall performance and stay actively engaged in his daily tasks. It's important to note that individual reactions to caffeine can vary, and while some may share Jason's inclination for coffee, others like Leslie might prefer alternative methods to energize themselves throughout the day. Ultimately, it's up to each individual to find the balance and habits that work best for them in terms of maintaining their physical and mental well-being, while respecting the choices of others and acknowledging that everyone's preferences and requirements are unique."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Are these two questions asking the same thing? Select from:  1). no;  2). yes;","output":"First question: Is self-love selfish? To determine whether self-love is selfish, it is necessary to understand the concept of self-love and selfishness. Self-love refers to the practice of taking care of one's own wellbeing, showing compassion to oneself, and recognizing the essential worth and value of oneself as a person. It is about prioritizing one's mental, emotional, and physical health.  Selfishness, on the other hand, is characterized by a lack of consideration for others, being concerned primarily with one's interests or welfare at the expense of others.  It's important to note that self-love is not inherently selfish. Self-love does not entail disregarding or dismissing the needs and feelings of others, but rather, it means being responsible for our well-being and understanding our value. In fact, understanding and practicing self-love makes us better equipped to establish stronger relationships with others and be more compassionate towards their feelings and experiences. A healthy level of self-love also enables us to set boundaries, which is essential in preventing ourselves from getting engulfed by the needs of others, compromising our mental and emotional health. Second question: Is love selfish or selfless? Love is a complex concept that can manifest in different forms, such as romantic love, familial love, or love for friends. Love can be both selfish and selfless, or, ideally, a balanced mix of both. Selfish love may involve prioritizing one's own needs, desires, or feelings above those of the other person. While some level of self-interest is natural and necessary in any relationship, excessive selfishness can become problematic and harmful. If love becomes possessive or controlling, or if the wellbeing of one person is consistently put above the other(s), this indicates that the love has turned predominantly selfish. Selfless love, on the other hand, refers to putting the needs, wants, and feelings of others above our own. It involves giving and caring without expecting anything in return. However, too much selflessness may not be healthy, as total disregard for personal needs can lead to feelings of resentment or loss of self-identity over time.  Ideally, love should maintain a balance of selfishness and selflessness, where both parties prioritize and respect the needs of each other. The most successful and fulfilling relationships allow for a mutual exchange of care, compassion, and consideration. Are these two questions asking the same thing? The answer is 2). yes. Despite the differences between self-love and love for others, the questions \\"Is self-love selfish?\\" and \\"Is love selfish or selfless?\\" share a common theme. Both questions fundamentally explore whether love, be it for oneself or others, should be entirely selfless or if it's acceptable and healthy to maintain some level of self-interest. As discussed, a balanced and nuanced approach is essential for both self-love and love for others, suggesting that the two questions are indeed asking the same thing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: This article: In 1688, the Spanish sent three more expeditions, two by sea and one by land. The land expedition, led by Alonso De León, discovered Jean Gery, who had deserted the French colony and was living in Southern Texas with the Coahuiltecans. Using Gery as a translator and guide, De León finally found the French fort in late April 1689. The fort and the five crude houses surrounding it were in ruins. Several months before, the Karankawa had attacked the settlement. They destroyed the structures and left the bodies of three people, including a woman who had been shot in the back. A Spanish priest who had accompanied De León conducted funeral services for the three victims. The chronicler of the Spanish expedition, Juan Bautista Chapa, wrote that the devastation was God's punishment for opposing the Pope, as Pope Alexander VI had granted the Indies exclusively to the Spanish. The remains of the fort were destroyed by the Spanish, who also buried the French cannons left behind. The Spanish later built a fort on the same location. In early 1689, Spanish authorities received a plea, written in French. Jumano scouts had received these papers from the Caddo, who asked that they be delivered to the Spanish. The papers included a parchment painting of a ship, as well as a written message from Jean L'Archevêque. The message read: I do not know what sort of people you are.

A:","output":"The review depicted for the C-IN2 Men's Underwear Contour Pouch Brief can be considered as both flattering and unflattering. Let's break down the review to better understand this. Flattering aspects: 1. The reviewer mentions that they really like the briefs. This implies that the product has an appealing design, quality, and overall appearance, which could potentially attract prospective buyers. 2. The fact that the reviewer took the time to write a review about the product suggests that they care about sharing their experience and opinion, indicating a level of satisfaction with the purchase. Unflattering aspects: 1. The main issue that the reviewer has with the product is the sizing, stating that the small size feels more like an extra-small. This can be considered unflattering as it may suggest inconsistencies in the sizing chart or a lack of accurate representation for customer expectations. This could deter potential buyers who are particular about the fit and comfort of their underwear. 2. While the review briefly addresses the sizing issue in one specific color (grey), it does not mention whether the same issue is present with other colors, leaving room for uncertainty and possible hesitation in potential customers.

Paragraph: Chinese Influences: The Japanese were forced out of the Korean peninsula in the sixth century, but not before the Koreans had bequeathed to the Yamato court copies of the sacred images and scriptures of Chinese Buddhism. Just as Christianity introduced Mediterranean culture into northern Europe, so Buddhism brought Chinese culture into Japanese society. Throughout the seventh and eighth centuries numerous Japanese monks, scholars, and artists made the perilous trip west across the Sea of Japan to study Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and painting — later to be brought back for further development in Japan. An outstanding figure of this time was Prince Shotoku, who in 604 developed the \\"Seventeen-Article Constitution,\\" outlining a code of human conduct and the ideals of state as a basic law for the nation. He also established relations with the Sui dynasty in China. Through him, the Japanese imperial court developed Chinese patterns of centralized government, with its formal bureaucracy of eight court ranks. The Chinese calendar was used to calculate the year of Japan's foundation by counting back the 1,260 years of the Chinese cosmological cycle. Thus, 660 b.c. is still the official date celebrated nationwide. At this early stage in its history Japan was already (for the most part) only nominally ruled by the emperor. De facto power was exercised by the militarily and economically strongest family. The Sogas had promoted Buddhism as an imperially sanctioned counterweight to the native Shinto religion, along with the new Chinese customs, to weaken the influence of their more conservative rivals. But they in turn were ousted in a.d. 645 by Nakatomi Kamatari, founder of the great Fujiwara clan, which was to rule Japanese affairs for hundreds of years and provide prominent advisers to the emperor even up to the 19th century.

The correct answer is \\"no.\\" The main country that influenced Japan in the region, according to the paragraph, was China. Buddhism brought Chinese culture into Japanese society, and many Japanese monks, scholars, and artists studied Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and painting. The paragraph mentions Christianity and Northern Europe as a comparison to illustrate how another religion (Christianity) brought a different culture to a different region (Northern Europe) but does not state that Northern Europe influenced Japan."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Audubon Woodlore goes out on the lake to check on the anglers. Humphrey the Bear is trying to catch some fish, but cannot seem to hold onto one once he catches it.  Woodlore sees the fish disappearing before his eyes, so he decides to stock the lake some more. As he heads to the fish hatchery, he sees Humphrey with a few fishing nets and rods, and asks him what he is doing.  When the bear tells him that he is going to catch some fish, Woodlore takes the rods and nets and tells him to \\"Go fish like a bear!\\" At the hatchery, Woodlore selects an envelope of fish eggs from a collection of eggs from such trout species as dolly vardens and rainbows. He fills a tub with water and inserts the eggs into it.  In a matter of seconds, several fishes pop up out of the water like plants out of soil. When the ranger gets to the lake to dump the fish, he finds Humphrey in there, trying to eat one of the small fishes, which is then consumed by a much larger fish. Humphrey manages to remove the small fish from the mouth of the large fish, and then uses it to lure five other large fishes that jump out of the water, but then Woodlore appears to measure the fish, while at the same time punishing Humphrey by hitting him on the head, causing him to sink into the depths of the lake. When Humphrey grabs some more fish and emerges from the lake, he discovers a fish larger than any of the others; this turns out to be a fish balloon with which a young boy is playing. Humphrey pops the balloon, and both the boy and Woodlore kick the bear in the knee. contains an answer for the question: What is the largest fish in the lake?, what is it ? Answer:","output":"The largest fish in the lake is not explicitly mentioned in the article. However, there is a description of a large fish that consumes the small fish Humphrey was trying to eat.

He is the son of April (Gholson) Tucker, who was seventeen when he was born, and Claude Neverson Jr. Raised as a military brat by his mother and stepfather, Songz did not have aspirations for a musical career as a child due to his shyness, saying \\"Singing wasn't a reality for me, until other people started noticing I sounded good.\\" He recognized his vocal abilities at the age of 14. While recording his debut album in 2004, Songz released multiple mixtapes under the alias Prince of Virginia. One of the mixtapes featured an \\"answer track\\" to R. Kelly's \\"Trapped in the Closet\\", entitled \\"Open the Closet\\". The song gave Songz some notoriety. His debut album, I Gotta Make It was released on July 26, 2005. It debuted at #20 on the Billboard 200, selling 40,000 copies in its first week of sales. It has sold 300,000 records in the US. Songz's debut single, Gotta Make It, featuring Twista, was released in March 2005 and reached #87 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #21 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. It garnered success in the R&B/urban community but failed to make a mark in mainstream music. The album's second and final single, Gotta Go, was released in July 2005 and reached #67 on the Hot 100 and #11 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, becoming even more successful than his debut single in the R&B/urban community and in the mainstream community. After promotion for his debut concluded, he was featured on the lead single from Twista's fifth album, The Day After. The single, \\"Girl Tonite\\", reached #14 on the Hot 100 and #3 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, becoming a huge hit.  In mid-2006, Songz began work on a follow-up album to his debut with longtime collaborator Troy Taylor and also employed successful Bryan-Michael Cox, Danja, Stargate and R. Kelly to help create the album. Trey aimed for the album to be more mainstream-oriented than his debut album. His second studio album, Trey Day, was released on October 2, 2007. The album reached #11 on the Billboard 200, selling 73,000 copies in its first week. It has since sold 400,000 records in the US, becoming his second album not to be certified by the RIAA. The album was going to be released on May 8, 2007, but was continually delayed in order for a successful single to precede the album, as the lead single failed to impact charts.  His second album was preceded by the lead single, \\"Wonder Woman\\", which was released in February 2007. It reached #54 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, but failed to impact the Hot 100. Because of the single's failure, his second album was delayed from May 2007 to October 2007. The album's second single, \\"Can't Help but Wait\\", was released in August 2007 and was released to promote his second album and the film Step Up 2 the Streets soundtrack as a single for it.

This important river in the southeastern United States begins its journey in the Blue Ridge Mountains, specifically at the Chattahoochee Spring in Jacks Knob, Georgia, which is at an elevation of about 3,500 feet. The river travels approximately 430 miles (690 kilometers) before merging with the Flint River to form the Apalachicola River at the Florida border, which eventually empties into the Gulf of Mexico. Throughout its long course, the Chattahoochee River flows through a variety of landscapes, including forests, urban areas, and agricultural lands. Once it leaves the northern Georgia mountains, it flows through the Atlanta metropolitan area, making it an essential source of drinking water for millions of people. It then continues to course through western Georgia and eastern Alabama, providing water for numerous communities, industries, as well as agricultural and recreational activities. The Chattahoochee River plays a significant role in the ecology of the region. It supports a diverse range of habitats and ecosystems, fostering a healthy environment for numerous flora and fauna species to thrive. That includes many species of fish, such as striped bass, largemouth bass, and catfish, which have crucial ecological and economic value. A variety of recreational activities take place along the Chattahoochee River, including fishing, boating, and whitewater rafting. There are also several parks, walking trails, and protected areas along its banks, encouraging locals and visitors to engage in outdoor adventures and appreciate the river's natural beauty. The river has a rich history and cultural significance, too. Native Americans, like the Creek and Cherokee peoples, once inhabited the lands surrounding the Chattahoochee River, where they relied on the river as a vital source of water, food, and transportation. Additionally, the region witnessed significant events during the American Civil War.

Angel di Maria struggled - one of his shots ballooned out of the stadium. Argentine winger was signed for £60m from Real Madrid last summer. Di Maria started superbly but has struggled with injuries in England. Louis van Gaal has played him as a striker in recent weeks. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Angel Di Maria's Journey From £60m Real Madrid Sensation to Struggling Manchester United Star Subtitle: Argentine winger's performance in recent 0-0 draw against Cambridge United sparks concern As Manchester United went head to head against Cambridge United on Friday night, a draw that ended in a goalless tie, speculations surrounding Angel Di Maria's form continue to arise. The Argentine winger struggled throughout the match, with one of his many shots ballooning out of the stadium. This has led to questions about Di Maria's position at the club, as well as the adjustments being made by United's manager, Louis van Gaal, who has been playing him as a striker in recent weeks. The 27-year-old Angel Di Maria was signed for a whopping £60m from the elite European club, Real Madrid last summer, making him the most expensive signing in the history of Manchester United. Upon his arrival in England, the Argentine international was widely regarded as one of the best football players in the world, having played an instrumental role in Real Madrid's famous 'La Decima' Champions League triumph. Di Maria started his Manchester United career superbly, scoring three goals and providing four assists in his first five appearances for the club. Unfortunately, injuries have plagued Di Maria's time in England. The winger has been in and out of the United line-up since his arrival and as a result, has struggled to find the kind of form that gained him a big-money move to Old Trafford. As the Premier League season advanced, Di Maria's performances began to falter. His inconsistent form drew criticisms from both fans and pundits alike, with some even suggesting that he has not lived up to his massive price tag. As a result, United manager Louis van Gaal decided to experiment with Di Maria's position on the field, opting to play him as a forward rather than in his preferred wide role. In the recent match against Cambridge United, Di Maria failed to make the desired impact. He repeatedly lost possession, missed goal-scoring opportunities and topped it off with an embarrassing shot that went way off target. While it may be only one match, this performance highlighted the issues surrounding Di Maria's form and begs the question - is he being properly utilized, or has he just failed to adapt to English football? Some argue that the change in position is to be blamed for Di Maria's recent struggles, pointing out that the Argentine star performed best when playing as a winger. They believe that Louis van Gaal's decision to play him as a striker is a direct cause of his decline in form, as the position may not suit the strengths of Di Maria's game. Others opine that Di Maria's inability to stay fit for long periods has had a significant effect on his performance. Injuries have forced him to miss key matches, and the lack of a consistent run of games has made it difficult for him to establish a steady form. In conclusion, Angel Di Maria's struggles in recent times can be attributed to various factors, including his change in position and a history of injuries. While it remains to be seen whether the Argentine winger would eventually adapt to the English game and truly live up to his £60m price tag, one thing is certain - Manchester United fans, as well as football enthusiasts, would be hoping that Di Maria rediscovers his sensational form to reclaim his position as one of the best football players in the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We were seated right away in the dark downstairs dining room, where the walls are lined with wood, and the wood is lined with wine bottles.  Our seating was comfortable, and not too close to the table next to us (relief).  The restaurant didn't seem incredibly busy - comfortably populated, but a few empty tables scattered around.  You might not even need a reservation.  Our server was very casual, in his dress and demeanor (jeans and black button downs seem to be the uniform).  His interactions with us were a little lax, a little moreso than I expected, given that it's a somewhat pricey joint, but he was knowledgeable and happy to give recommendations, which is always appreciated.  The menu changes daily, so there are no specials.  Everything is a special, in that sense.  The wine list, printed on the back, was absolutely delightful since almost every bottle can be ordered in a taster portion, a half glass, a full glass, or a bottle.  Lovely!  I ordered three tasters throughout the evening, and it was such a fun experience.  We drank white with our appetizers, red for dinner, and sparkling for dessert.  I was never too drunk or too full of wine, the price was great, the taster portions were more generous than I expected, and I got to try five kinds of wine.  Hard to beat.  We had a Montravel from Spain, which my boyfriend loved, and their Riesling, which I loved.  Both wines were flavorful and unique, and it was a truly great experience to have excellent wine again, compared to our usual bottles purchased cheaply from the store.  Our appetizers were the Mac and Cheese (goat cheese, local sausage, and a fried egg in the dish), and the Stuffed Poblano Peppers.  The Mac 'n' Cheese was good, creamy but not too heavy, and the pasta was orzo which was fun.  But the Peppers  - just to die for.  To.  Die.  They had been roasted, it seems, or grilled, and were filled with the most flavorful housemade pork sausage.  We were both bowled over.  If this is on the menu, don't miss it.  Their sausage is the real deal.  Next we got two tasters of red, the Cotes-du-Rhone and something else....also very uniquely flavored and rich wines.  Our entrees were the Suckling Pig and the Hanger Steak.  The steak was my favorite - cooked to a delightful medium rare and served with roasted potatoes and rutabegas, it was simple and unpretentious.  Great beef flavor, nothing too intrusive or unusual.  Just high quality food.  The pig was good as well - the texture was divine, soft and reminiscent of pulled pork only better.  The sweet potato mash alongside was great.  My only complaint was the sauce was, in my opinion, too salty.  Anything it touched became too salty, and the sweet potato mash was needed to cut through that sodium taste.  I think it bothered me more than it bothered my boyfriend.  We absolutely finished both plates, practically licking them clean, but I'd watch out for that sauce if you're sensitive to salt.  For dessert I had a glass of moscato, sweet and lovely, and we split the \\"peanut butter ice cream sandwich\\" which seemed more like a peanut butter pie, but who's complaining?  It was very good and a great end to the meal.  All this for about 75.  The way they price their wines makes all the difference, and a great meal instantly becomes much more affordable than you'd expect.  I'd recommend Toast! to anyone, especially wine lovers.  It was such a treat, and didn't break the bank. Is this review positive or negative?

Dahası, bölgesel pazarın WTO yönetmelikleri ve ikili anlaşmalar yoluyla serbestleştirilmesi, şu anda son derece düşük olan doğrudan dış yatırım seviyesini de yükseltecek. Translate this to English?","output":"Furthermore, the liberalization of the regional market through WTO regulations and bilateral agreements will also increase the level of foreign direct investment, which is currently extremely low. In addition to the translation, it is essential to understand the context and implications of this statement. The sentence talks about the benefits of liberalizing a regional market and how it promotes increased foreign direct investment (FDI). The World Trade Organization (WTO) is an international organization that sets global trade rules and helps its member countries negotiate trade agreements. One of the main objectives of the WTO is to facilitate international trade and reduce barriers. Liberalization refers to the process of removing various restrictions and regulations that govern international trade, ideally making a market more open and competitive. This can take the form of reducing import tariffs, eliminating export subsidies, or lifting restrictions like quotas and licenses. Doing so allows companies from different countries to enter new markets easily, create jobs, and foster economic growth. FDI is a form of investment where a company or individual from one country acquires substantial ownership or control in a company based in another country. High levels of FDI indicate strong investor confidence, a healthy business environment, and a stable political climate. When foreign companies invest in a regional market, they bring capital, technology, know-how, and best practices from their home country, which can significantly contribute to the growth and development of the host country. The statement highlights the potential growth in FDI in the region as a result of the liberalization of the market through WTO regulations and bilateral agreements. Bilateral agreements are those made between two countries, often covering trade, economic cooperation, and other areas of mutual interest. Countries negotiate their trade rules and tariffs, aiming for reduced trade barriers in these agreements, which can further promote investment and diversify their economies. In short, by adhering to WTO regulations and fostering bilateral agreements, countries can encourage the inflow of foreign investment, which in turn strengthens the overall economy and drives development."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question 2: Do teachers or professors look down on students who score low on test? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Yes, questions 1 and 2 are essentially asking the same thing, which is whether teachers or professors have a negative perception of students who score low on tests or have lower academic performance in general. To provide a detailed and long answer about this particular topic, it is important to acknowledge that teachers and professors have varying opinions of students based on their professional experience, teaching philosophy, and level of interaction with the students. 1. Empathetic Teachers: Many teachers recognize the fact that not all students have the same aptitude for learning and may perform poorly on tests. Such teachers often adopt the role of mentors, focusing on the growth and development of the student as an individual. They look for ways to improve the students' academic performance in the long term by suggesting different study strategies, offering supplementary materials for learning, or encouraging the student to seek help from tutors or other support resources. 2. Teachers With High Expectations: Some teachers may have higher expectations from their students as a way to challenge and push them to achieve greater academic success. While they may not necessarily look down on low-scoring students, these teachers may express disappointment if a student is not living up to their potential or not putting in enough effort. They believe that setting high expectations will help students strive for better results. 3. Objectivity and Fairness: A majority of teachers and professors strive for objectivity and fairness when assessing student performance. These educators are aware that every student has different strengths and weaknesses, learning styles, and backgrounds. They understand that low test scores may not necessarily indicate a lack of intelligence but could instead imply a struggling communication of knowledge and application. 4. Teachers Considering External Factors: Teachers are often aware that students may encounter situations outside of school that can affect their performance. These can include personal issues, family problems, or even health issues. Some educators try to be empathetic towards struggling students and offer support beyond the classroom, such as counseling or peer mentorship programs, to help the student overcome external challenges that may be causing their low scores. 5. Impact of Education System and Standardized Testing: The education system and standardized testing can sometimes cause teachers to judge their students based on test scores or academic performance because these metrics are quantifiable and easy to analyze. This may unintentionally lead some teachers to look down on low-scoring students due to a perceived lack of effort, intelligence, or motivation. In summary, while there may be instances where some teachers or professors look down on students with low test scores, most educators approach student performance with objectivity, empathy, high expectations, and an understanding of external factors influencing their students' lives. As teaching philosophies continue to evolve, there are increasing efforts to evaluate student progress via comprehensive and holistic methods to provide more accurate assessments and foster a more inclusive and supportive learning environment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Drugs also played an integral part in Kiedis' writings, as he'd only been sober since December 2000. Tracks like \\"This Is the Place\\" and \\"Don't Forget Me\\" expressed his intense relationship with narcotics, the harmful physical and emotional effects they caused him and the ever-present danger of relapse (as Kiedis has suffered chronic relapse into drug-dependency). He referenced early Chili Peppers guitarist Hillel Slovak in \\"This Is the Place\\" and describes how drug use forced him to miss the funeral: \\"On the day my best friend died/I could not get my copper clean.\\" \\"Venice Queen\\" was composed lyrically as an ode to Kiedis' drug rehabilitation therapist, Gloria Scott, who died shortly after he purchased her a home on California's Venice Beach. It mourned her death as a painful loss: \\"We all want to tell her/Tell her that we love her/Venice gets a queen/Best I've ever seen.\\" By the Way diverged from the band's previous styles, containing few funk-driven songs. \\"Can't Stop\\" and the title track were the only songs which revisited the Chili Peppers' once trademark style of short, rapped verses. \\"Throw Away Your Television,\\" while not having any rapidly sung lyrics, also contained a funk-oriented bass line, though hinted at experimental rock due to the heavy use of distortion throughout the verse and chorus.

We returned the drill and opted to purchase a hammer, since the  Choose from: 1). drill was useless for our building project. 2). hammer was useless for our building project.","output":"We returned the drill and opted to purchase a hammer, since the drill was useless for our building project. As we proceeded with the building project, it became more and more evident that a hammer was essential for our needs. The drill, although a valuable tool for some tasks, simply did not provide the versatility and necessary functions that the hammer could. The hammer allowed us to tackle a range of tasks, such as driving nails into various materials like wood or drywall, which were vital components in our building project. Additionally, the ability to dismantle and remove nails seamlessly was a crucial aspect for a successful project. A hammer, with its flat head, could easily get underneath a nail head and pull it out with minimal effort, making it an indispensable tool when adjustments and corrections were required. Moreover, a hammer was an effective tool for wedging and tapping items into place. During the building process, it was often necessary to make sure that the components of our structure were securely fixed and properly aligned. The hammer was the perfect tool for this purpose, as it allowed us to apply force to any part of the structure requiring a tighter connection. Versatility was another factor that made a hammer essential for our project. It proved to be useful in various stages, from the beginning of the construction process to the end. Whether we were framing walls, securing roofing materials, or installing fasteners, the hammer remained one of the most relied-upon tools we possessed. Furthermore, it became apparent that the shape and design of the hammer were highly advantageous. The curved claw on the back enabled us to extract nails efficiently, while the sturdy handle provided a comfortable grip, allowing for maximum control and precision. In contrast, the drill was not well-suited for our building project. While it excelled in drilling holes and driving screws, it simply did not have the ability nor the versatility that the hammer possessed. Drilling holes was a limited function in the context of our project, and the lack of adaptability with the tasks at hand rendered it an inessential tool.

Bruce Randall Hornsby (born November 23, 1954) is an American singer and pianist. Hornsby draws frequently from classical, jazz, bluegrass, folk, Motown, gospel, rock, blues, and jam band musical traditions. Hornsby's recordings have been recognized on a number of occasions with industry awards, including the 1987 Grammy Award for Best New Artist with Bruce Hornsby and the Range, the 1990 Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album, and the 1994 Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance. Hornsby has also achieved recognition for his solo albums and performances, his touring band Bruce Hornsby and the Noisemakers, his bluegrass project with Ricky Skaggs and his appearances as a session and guest musician. Bruce Randall Hornsby was born in Williamsburg, Virginia, a son of Robert Stanley Hornsby (1920-1998), an attorney, real-estate developer and former musician, and his wife, nee Lois Saunier. Raised a Christian Scientist, he has two siblings: Robert Saunier \\"Bobby\\" Hornsby, a realtor with Hornsby Realty and locally known musician, and Jonathan Bigelow Hornsby, an engineer who has collaborated in songwriting.  He graduated from James Blair High School in Williamsburg, Virginia, in 1973, where he played on the basketball team. He studied music at the University of Richmond, as well as Berklee College of Music and the University of Miami, from which he graduated in 1977.  In the spring of 1974 Hornsby's older brother Bobby, who attended the University of Virginia, formed the band \\"Bobby Hi-Test and the Octane Kids\\" to play fraternity parties, featuring Bruce on Fender Rhodes and vocals. The band, which is listed in Skeleton Key: A Dictionary for Deadheads, performed covers of Allman Brothers Band, The Band, and predominantly Grateful Dead songs. Although Hornsby's collaboration with Bobby Hornsby would be relatively short-lived, Bobby's son R.S. was a recurring guest-guitarist with Hornsby's band and periodically toured with his uncle. His performances were often looked forward to by fans. R.S. Hornsby died on January 15, 2009 in a car accident near Crozet, Virginia. He was 28.  Following his graduation from the University of Miami, in 1977, Hornsby returned to his hometown of Williamsburg, and played in local clubs and hotel bars. In 1980, he and his younger brother (and songwriting partner) John Hornsby moved to Los Angeles, where they spent three years writing for 20th Century Fox. Before moving back to his native southeastern Virginia, he also spent time in Los Angeles as a session musician. In 1982 Hornsby joined the band Ambrosia for their last album Road Island and can be seen in the band's video for the album's single \\"How Can You Love Me.\\" After Ambrosia disbanded, he and bassist Joe Puerta performed as members of the touring band for pop star Sheena Easton. Hornsby can clearly be seen in the music video for Easton's 1984 hit single \\"Strut.\\"","output":"This text is about Bruce Randall Hornsby, an American singer and pianist."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Except for three months' formal schooling as a 12-year-old, during which he was bullied and ridiculed by his classmates, Percy was educated at home.  Rose, an autodidact with a dominating presence, supervised his music and literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From his earliest lessons, Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic culture; writing late in life, he said that the Icelandic Saga of Grettir the Strong was \\"the strongest single artistic influence on my life\\". As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie in art rather than music. At the age of 10 he began studying piano under Louis Pabst, a German immigrant then considered to be Melbourne's leading piano teacher. Grainger's first known composition, \\"A Birthday Gift to Mother\\", is dated 1893. Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894, at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building. The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance delighted the Melbourne critics, who dubbed him \\"the flaxen-haired phenomenon who plays like a master\\". This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at  the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany, an institution recommended by William Laver, head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music. Financial assistance was secured through a fund-raising benefit concert in Melbourne and a final recital in Adelaide, after which mother and son left Australia for Europe on 29 May 1895.

Answer the following question: Two coastal communities  on two neighboring gulfs took different approaches to  bringing more money into the local economy. Davin village continued with commercial fishing and agriculture, while the village of Forx decided to mine sand from the nearby dunes, because it was very profitable. They did not think about the effect it would have on the environment.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which village was less thoughtful about the environment? Answer:","output":"The village that demonstrated less thoughtfulness about the environment, based on the information given in the paragraph, is the village of Forx. This conclusion can be drawn from the statement that explicitly mentions that they decided to mine sand from the nearby dunes due to its profitability, but did not consider the potential impact this activity could have on the environment.  On the other hand, the village of Davin, continued with commercial fishing and agriculture, both of which have potential environmental effects, yet the paragraph does not denote whether or not they considered these effects. However, the criticism towards Davin is not as direct as it was towards Forx, which leads us to believe that Forx was less thoughtful about the environment. Sand mining can lead to significant environmental damage. The process typically involves removing massive amounts of sand from a particular area, which can lead to erosion, changes in local ecosystems, loss of biodiversity, and potentially, the destruction of the homes of local wildlife. In coastal regions, sand mining can also lead to the depletion of protective beachfront sand dunes, which can increase the risk of flooding and storm damage to the community, accelerating coastal erosion and increasing the likelihood of damaging storm surges. On the contrary, commercial fishing and agriculture, while capable of causing environmental harm, have methods that can be followed to lessen that impact. This includes practices like sustainable fishing, where the population of the targeted species is allowed to maintain a healthy level, and the use of fishing techniques that do not unnecessarily harm other marine life. Similarly, sustainable farming practices can be employed that help reduce environmental harm - including rotating crops to keep the soil healthy, using natural fertilizers and pest control methods, and preventing runoff into local water sources. The absence of any explicit assertion in the paragraph that these steps were not taken by the village of Davin lets us draw the conclusion that Forx was less considerate towards the environment in their activities."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who conceptualized \\"Single Ladies\\" after Beyoncé's secret marriage to hip hop recording artist Jay-Z? ?  \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\" was written by Beyoncé, Terius \\"The-Dream\\" Nash, Thaddis \\"Kuk\\" Harrell, and Christopher \\"Tricky\\" Stewart, and was produced by Nash and Stewart. Beyoncé recorded the song in May 2008 at the Boom Boom Room Studio in Burbank, California, and it was mixed by Jaycen Joshua and Dave Pensado, with assistance from Randy Urbanski and Andrew Wuepper. Nash conceptualized \\"Single Ladies\\" after Beyoncé's secret marriage to hip hop recording artist Jay-Z in April 2008. Stewart commented that the song was \\"the only public statement that [Beyoncé and Jay-Z had] ever made about marriage\\", and that while in the studio recording the song Beyoncé had remained tightlipped, even to the point of removing her wedding band. Beyoncé's marriage inspired Nash to compose a song about an issue that affected many people's relationships: the fear or unwillingness of men to commit. In an interview with Billboard magazine, Beyoncé added that she was drawn to the song because of the universality of the topic, an issue that \\"people are passionate about and want to talk about and debate\\". She stated that although \\"Single Ladies\\" is a playful uptempo song, it addresses an issue that women experience every day.In \\"Single Ladies\\", Beyoncé portrays her alter ego Sasha Fierce, which appears on the second part of I Am...

The singles debuted on US radio on October 8, 2008; \\"Single Ladies\\" did so on mainstream urban New York radio station Power 105.1. Both singles were added to rhythmic contemporary radio playlists on October 12, 2008; \\"Single Ladies\\" was sent to urban contemporary playlists the same day, while \\"If I Were a Boy\\" was instead classified for contemporary hit radio.

Hunter wanted Nelson to try the sweet lime because","output":"Hunter knew that Nelson had always enjoyed flavors that leaned more towards the sweeter side, and he felt that the sweet lime would be an exceptional choice for Nelson to explore. Sweet limes, being less sour and bitter than the usual limes, would cater to Nelson's taste buds much better than the conventional variety. Hunter had always noticed that Nelson would tend to avoid sour and tangy flavors, as they were too sharp for his liking. In most social gatherings or while dining out, Nelson would tend to gravitate towards milder and sweeter food and beverages. This made Hunter quite confident that introducing the sweet lime to his friend might turn out to be a pleasant surprise and a newfound favorite for Nelson. Hunter knew that the sweet lime, with its lower acidity and higher natural sugar content, would be more in tune with Nelson's preferences. Having an entirely distinct flavor profile from the common lime, the sweet lime would exempt Nelson from experiencing the puckering sensation and the ever so subtle sense of discomfort that comes with the consumption of sour foods. Moreover, introducing the sweet lime to Nelson would not only provide him the opportunity to experience a new taste but also the chance to add a healthy and refreshing fruit to his diet. Sweet limes are known for being packed with essential nutrients such as Vitamin C, potassium, and antioxidants. By promoting the sweet lime, Hunter, in turn, was motivated by the desire to contribute to the overall well-being of his dear friend Nelson. In conclusion, Hunter wanted Nelson to try the sweet lime because he believed it would be much more enjoyable and palatable for Nelson, given its less sour flavor profile and numerous health benefits. Having observed Nelson's inclination towards sweet flavors, and his aversion to the sour ones, Hunter was convinced that the sweet lime would be a delightful addition to Nelson's culinary world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(Evan Vucci-AP) The preseason is halfway over, but questions around the NFL may be growing rather than diminishing. Here are 10 things we’re not sure of heading into Week 3: If the Browns have a starting QB: Veteran Brian Hoyer had an opportunity to lock up the job Monday. Rookie Johnny Manziel had a shot to bolster his own case. Both failed in an ugly performance at Washington as each passer — and the Cleveland offense generally — looked way out of sorts … except when rookie QB Connor Shaw was taking the snaps (and we don’t think coach Mike Pettine will pick him). Said Hoyer: “It probably couldn’t have been any worse.” Said Manziel: “I don’t think I did a very good job today.” Wouldn’t be a surprise if Pettine deviates from his roadmap and lets this competition play out another week. FOR THE WIN: Manziel flips Redskins the bird If the Eagles defense is fixed: No NFL D was on the field longer, faced more plays or surrendered more passing yards than Philadelphia’s in 2013. Drafting OLB Marcus Smith in Round 1 and signing S Malcolm Jenkins were moves designed to alleviate the issues. But the pudding is showing no proof. Yes, preseason stats must be taken with many grains of salt, but the Eagles have allowed nearly 1,000 yards in two games, are failing to get off the field on third down more than 60% of the time and allowing opponents to hold the ball for nearly 40 minutes. Uh oh. If anyone has explained the no-dunking rule to Jimmy Graham in more detail: Don’t slam the ball over the crossbar, or your team loses 15 yards. Simple enough, right? But Graham didn’t care to abide by the new NFL policy Friday on either of his TD catches. However it sounds like coach Sean Payton has subsequently made himself loud and clear, and that Graham probably won’t be flushing any more footballs, preseason or not. Right, Jimmy? “I can’t guarantee you that, but I would never do anything to hurt this team,” Graham said. Bengals WR Mohamed Sanu glides by Jets CB Kyle Wilson for a TD. (Andrew Weber-USA TODAY Sports) If the Jets can survive with this secondary: Rex Ryan’s beloved defense is badly depleted at corner with Dee Milliner’s ankle of primary concern. Bengals QB Andy Dalton torched New York for a perfect 158.3 rating (8-for-8, 144 yards, TD) Saturday. That has to give Ryan night sweats since he knows the Jets face Matt Schaub, Aaron Rodgers, Jay Cutler, Matthew Stafford, Philip Rivers, Peyton Manning and Tom Brady in their first seven regular-season contests. If the Giants can survive with this offense: QB Eli Manning has 49 passing yards — in three preseason games. He’s completed seven passes. He’s been sacked three times. The Giants are breaking in new backs, young wideouts, a rebuilt O-line and (most importantly) new coordinator Ben McAdoo’s system. A lot of moving parts that aren’t close to clicking. Jags QB Blake Bortles was the No. 3 pick in May’s NFL draft. (Dennis Wierzbicki-USA TODAY Sports) If Blake Bortles will keep that redshirt: The Jaguars want to adhere to their plan of playing veteran QB Chad Henne for the entire 2014 season. But no rookie has consistently shown more poise and production this preseason than Bortles, the first passer picked in May’s draft. That’s still no reason to rush him into the lineup, but the Jags have to feel better about the prospect of potentially breaking the seal this season if Henne can’t tread water. (And the same can be said of Vikings rookie QB Teddy Bridgewater, who ripped up the Cardinals backups Saturday to the tune of 177 yards and two TDs in the second half.) Who are the Houston Texans? They got blown out 32-0 by a playoff-caliber squad (Cardinals) one week and blew out a playoff-caliber squad (Falcons) 32-7 the next. Again, it’s just preseason — and Houston RB Arian Foster and WR Andre Johnson have yet to suit up — but don’t be surprised if this team finds a way to look pretty good on the way to 8-9 wins and pretty ugly in 7-8 losses. Houston is talented enough to be in the wild-card scrum by season’s end. If the Chargers and 49ers are as bad as they appeared in Week 2: Collectively, they lost to the Seahawks and Broncos, respectively, 75-14. But San Diego QB Philip Rivers played one series at CenturyLink Field while San Francisco’s Colin Kaepernick was in for two during his first game at brand new Levi’s Stadium. More importantly, the Bolts and Seahawks meet in Week 2 of the regular season, while the Niners and Broncos reunite in Week 7. Safe to assume that none of these 2013 playoff teams wanted to tip their hands with those far more important rematches on the horizon, so probably also safe to not overanalyze the weekend blowouts. If the Titans still consider WR Justin Hunter a ‘JAG': Or “just a guy,” which appeared on his practice jersey last week. But following a four-catch, 111-yard game in New Orleans — which included a 64-yard catch-and-run score and beautiful high-wire job on the boundary for another TD — Hunter may be settling in as “just a great” weapon for Tennessee in his second pro campaign. Titans WR Justin Hunter gets his toes down for one of his Friday night TDs in New Orleans. (Bill Haber-AP) If Travis Kelce still qualifies as a fantasy sleeper: The Chiefs’ second-year tight end may have remained somewhat anonymous despite a 69-yard TD in the preseason’s opening week. That was before he added a 43-yard score on national TV Sunday night. With an injury-marred rookie year behind him, Kelce could be the seam-strafing weapon the K.C. offense could so clearly use … and maybe a no-longer-secret weapon for fantasy GMs across the nation. Brian Hoyer, Browns, Houston Texans, Johnny Manziel, New York Giants, New York Jets, NFL preseason Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"The preseason of the NFL continues with many questions remaining unanswered, such as the starting quarterback for the Browns and if the Eagles defense has improved. Meanwhile, rookie quarterbacks like Blake Bortles and Teddy Bridgewater show great potential during the games."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Alicia Augello Cook (born January 25, 1981), known professionally as Alicia Keys, is an American singer-songwriter, pianist, music producer, philanthropist, and actress. Keys released her debut album, Songs in A Minor in 2001 with J Records, having had previous record deals first with Columbia and then Arista Records. Songs in A Minor produced her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one single \\"Fallin'\\", and sold over 12 million copies worldwide. The album earned Keys five Grammy Awards in 2002. Following Davis to his newly formed J Records label, she worked with Kerry \\"Krucial\\" Brothers and recorded the songs \\"Rock wit U\\" and \\"Rear View Mirror\\", which were featured on the soundtracks to the films Shaft (2000) and Dr. Dolittle 2 (2001), respectively. Keys' first studio album Songs in A Minor was released in June 2001. Musically, it incorporated classical piano in an R&B, soul and jazz album. Jane Stevenson of Jam! described the music as \\"old-school urban sounds and attitude set against a backdrop of classical piano and sweet, warm vocals\\". USA Today's Steve Jones wrote that Keys \\"taps into the blues, soul, jazz and even classical music to propel haunting melodies and hard-driving funk\\". Debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 236,000 units, it went on to sell over 6.2 million copies in the United States and 12 million copies internationally. Additionally, it was certified six times Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Songs in A Minor established Keys' popularity both inside and outside of the United States where she became the best-selling new artist and R&B artist of the year.  The album's release was preceded by the April release of her debut single, \\"Fallin'\\", which spent six weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100. The album's second single, \\"A Woman's Worth\\", was released in February 2002 and peaked at seven on the Hot 100 and number three on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs; becoming her second top ten single on both charts. Released in June, \\"How Come You Don't Call Me\\" served as the album's third single, peaking at 59 on the Hot 100. The album's fourth single \\"Girlfriend\\" was released in the United Kingdom where it peaked at 82. The following year, the album was reissued as Remixed & Unplugged in A Minor, which included eight remixes and seven unplugged versions of the songs from the original.  Songs in A Minor led Keys to win five awards at the 2002 Grammy Awards: Song of the Year, Best Female R&B Vocal Performance, and Best R&B Song for \\"Fallin'\\", Best New Artist, and Best R&B Album; \\"Fallin'\\" was also nominated for Record of the Year. Keys became the second female solo artist to win five Grammy Awards in a single night, following Lauryn Hill at the 41st Grammy Awards. That same year, she collaborated with Christina Aguilera for the latter's upcoming album Stripped on a song titled \\"Impossible\\", which Keys wrote, co-produced, and provided with background vocals. During the early 2000s, Keys also made small cameos in television series Charmed and American Dreams.

Cincinnati scored first on a 22-yard TD pass to wide receiver Kelley Washington from Carson Palmer.  The Browns responded with a 30-yard FG by kicker Phil Dawson.  The Bengals extended their lead with an 8-yard TD pass to wide receiver Chad Johnson.  In the second quarter, kicker Shayne Graham made a 37-yard field goal as time ran out to give Cincinnati a 17-3 halftime lead. In the fourth quarter, Graham would give the Bengals a 37-yard field goal, and the Browns responded with a 1-yard touchdown run by running back Reuben Droughns.  Two touchdown runs by Bengal running back Rudi Johnson put the game out of reach.  The Browns scored one more touchdown with quarterback Charlie Frye's 2-yard run, but it was not enough as the Bengals improved to 2-0. Several Bengals were injured during this game. David Pollack, a 2nd year linebacker, suffered a non-paralyzing broken neck (fracturing his C6 vertebra), and would miss the rest of the season. Safety Dexter Jackson suffered a severe ankle sprain. Center Rich Braham also suffered a leg injury, and was expected to be out for some weeks. Wide receiver, Chad Johnson appeared dinged up too. On his 8-yard touchdown reception, he appeared to have an injured shoulder (made noticeable by his unenthusiastic post-score celebratory dance). Even though he continued to play, he appeared to be in pain. Later in the game, during a Browns interception, he was blocked by a Brown's safety, which gave him a concussion.

On a scale from 0-5, where 0 is \\"not similar\\" and 5 is \\"very similar\\", how similar is the sentence \\"Conmen dressed as women steal cash\\" to the sentence \\"CCTV: York conmen dress as women to trick pensioners\\"?","output":"In terms of similarity, the two sentences could be rated as 4 on a scale from 0 to 5. Both sentences discuss the same subject matter: the action of conmen using deceptive appearances, specifically dressed as women, to commit their crimes. This main theme is central to both sentences, making them largely similar. Sentence 1, \\"Conmen dressed as women steal cash,\\" is a short, concise statement. It outlines a crime committed by conmen, who dress as women to steal money. However, the victims, the location, or the proof are left unspecified. Sentence 2, \\"CCTV: York conmen dress as women to trick pensioners,\\" provides more specific details about the same subject. It adds that there is CCTV footage of the incident. It also places the conmen in a specific location (York) and reveals the victims of the crime (pensioners). This sentence contains the same base information as the first one but offers additional knowledge about the circumstances of the crime. However, the slight differences in the specificity of the details mentioned in the second statement (CCTV footage, location, and specific victims, which are pensioners) are what pushes the similarity rating down from a perfect 5 to a 4. While the core theme of each sentence is identical, the particulars mentioned in the second sentence are not available in the first. Additionally, the action \\"steal cash\\" in the first sentence is slightly different from \\"trick pensioners\\" in the second; both indicate a con but don't necessarily involve the same methods, leading to a slight reduction in the overall similarity.  In summary, while the central implication of men committing fraud while dressed as women is the same, slight variations in the details of the crime push the similarity rating down just slightly to a 4 instead of an outright 5."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The Saints commanded the first quarter with RB Chris Ivory getting a 3-yard TD run, followed by kicker Garrett Hartley getting a 50-yard field goal, and then by Ivory making a 6-yard TD run. The lead was narrowed as kicker David Buehler got a 21-yard field goal, but the Saints replied as Hartley nailed a 45-yard field goal.

The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.

Write a text based on this summary: india 's economy plan fails to convince analysts Text:","output":"Title: India's Aspiration for Economic Stabilization Falls Short of Analyst Expectations In recent years, India has asserted itself as a major player on the global economic stage, attempting to compete with established economies such as China and the United States. However, their latest economic plan, which comprises a series of reforms and initiatives aimed at stimulating growth, appears to have largely failed to convince analysts. Many question the feasibility and effectiveness of these proposals in addressing the structural issues plaguing the nation's burgeoning economy. In this article, we will delve deeper into the reasons behind this prevailing skepticism among financial experts. The recent release of India's economic blueprint featured several ambitious strategies to tackle pertinent challenges such as inflation, unemployment, and the massive informal sector, which has been a constant thorn in the side of the Indian government. Key highlights of the plan include encouraging foreign direct investment, increasing digitalization, and advancing infrastructural projects. On paper, these policies seem promising; however, analysts point out that the devil lies in the details - or rather, the lack thereof. One significant concern for market experts is the lack of concrete action plans accompanying these broad initiatives. According to them, the Indian government has outlined numerous grandiose objectives but has not provided clear strategies or timelines on how these aims will be achieved. This reluctance to outline quantitative targets has further stoked the fires of skepticism among economists, hindering the credibility of the plan. Another crucial issue hindering the success of India's economic plan is the enduring bureaucracy and regulatory hassles that have long plagued the nation. Foreign investors are often deterred by the excessive red tape and corruption, which stifles business growth. While the newest blueprint has promised to relax regulations and improve the ease of doing business, past governments have made similar assurances with little to no tangible progress. There is, therefore, little reason for analysts to believe that the present government can enact any meaningful change in this area. Additionally, the plan's focus on digitalization has raised eyebrows among economic experts. Although increased digitalization is a commendable goal in the modern era, some argue that it is not yet the primary solution to India's current economic woes. In a nation where a significant portion of the population still lacks access to basic necessities such as clean water and electricity, it is questionable whether prioritizing technological innovations is the most prudent approach to addressing major economic issues. Finally, many consider the penchant for infrastructural projects as an attempt by the Indian government to create short-term solutions to long-term problems. By presenting these projects as a means for economic stimulation, the government may be ignoring more pressing challenges- such as the need for sustainable agricultural development, reducing income inequality, and providing reliable access to essential services. In conclusion, while the objectives laid out in India's latest economic plan may appear optimistic, the lack of specific implementation strategies and a failure to address deep-rooted structural issues within the country's economy have left analysts unconvinced. To achieve lasting growth and stability, India must shift its focus from presenting glimmering policy promises to presenting actionable, targeted solutions that accurately address the nation's multitude of economic and social issues. Until then, the optimism surrounding India's economic ascent will remain tempered by the doubts of the expert community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: Process: - Electromagnet creates magnetic field with electricity - Conductive copper wire is wrapped around a piece of metal - An electric current gets introduced from power source - Flows through the wire - Magnetic field gets created in the wire - And the metal gets magnetized - When turned off it is no longer magnetic.  Question: suppose some copper broke happens, how will it affect results in a stronger electromagnet.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If a break occurs in the copper wire used to create an electromagnet, it will negatively impact the strength of the electromagnet. Conductive copper wire is crucial for generating a strong magnetic field when an electric current is introduced through it. This magnetic field is what magnetizes the piece of metal, giving it its electromagnetic properties. Each coil of wire that wraps around the metal enhances the strength of the magnetic field, so a continuous and uninterrupted wire is essential for an effective electromagnet. When a break happens in a copper wire, the electric current would not flow through it as efficiently or may not flow through it at all, which will disrupt and weaken the magnetic field. Consequently, this will lead to a less effective electromagnet with reduced magnetization properties. Comparing the scenarios with and without the break, there will be a reduction in the magnet's ability to attract or repel other ferromagnetic materials. As for the supposed perturbation's influence on the second effect mentioned, which is the metal's magnetization, it will also have a negative impact. If the break in the copper wire reduces the electromagnet's strength, the metal will be less magnetized than it would have been without the break. This weaker effect means that the metal will have a reduced ability to attract or repel other ferromagnetic materials when the electric current is applied. In summary, a break in the copper wire used in creating an electromagnet will have a detrimental effect on the resulting magnetic field and the metal's magnetization ability. The electromagnet will be less efficient and less effective, reducing its capability in various applications, such as lifting heavy loads, sorting magnetic materials, or providing powerful motors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Federalism: The post-Imperial nature of Russian subdivision of government changed towards a generally autonomous model which began with the establishment of the USSR (of which Russia was governed as part). It was liberalized in the aftermath of the Soviet Union, with the reforms under Boris Yeltsin preserving much of the Soviet structure while applying increasingly liberal reforms to the governance of the constituent republics and subjects (while also coming into conflict with Chechen secessionist rebels during the Chechen War). Some of the reforms under Yeltsin were scaled back by Vladimir Putin. Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\".

Given the question: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement is not expected to derail diplomatic momentum to reach a deal to end North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, but it could complicate the negotiation process, analysts say. Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization. But apprehension over whether future U.S. presidents would uphold a nuclear deal reached by Trump could reinforce the North Korean demand for early concessions. John Delury, a North...

Preacher of hate Abu Hamza yesterday told a court yesterday he had just been a spokesman for Yemeni a terrorist group that ended up killing three Britons ‘like Gerry Adams with the IRA’. Hamza said he had no advanced knowledge of the kidnapping of 16 tourists in December 1998 - which ended in a bloodbath when three Britons and an Australian were killed in a firefight. Hamza admitted the prosecution claim that he bought the kidnappers a satellite phone and topped it up with £500 credit. Hiding in plain sight: Abu Hamza, sketched giving testimony earlier this month, was accused by the judge of hiding his terror message behind his religion. But he claimed his motives were dramatically different from those which have been alleged -  because he wanted a peaceful conclusion. Hamza, who at the time was running the Finsbury Park mosque in North London said: ‘To be clear, I was acting like Gerry Adams with the IRA. ‘We couldn’t afford to do anything other than (be) legal and transparent’. The court was shown phone records from December 27 1998, the day before the kidnapping, which revealed that Hamza’s home landline was called three times by the satellite phone. The following day the tourists were ambushed as they drove through the desert in Yemen by members of the fanatical Islamic Army of Aden. Abu Hamza al-Masri facing U.S. terrorism charges, gives testimony in Manhattan federal court in New York in this artist's sketch. Hamza said that he only found out after the fact because he was called by an associate in the UK  - and felt that a ‘can of worms’ had been opened. He told the jury how he thought the terrorists had shown ‘ignorance’ by moving without consulting him. Five hours after the hostage taking - as the tourists were being used as human shields amid a furious gun battle - Hamza spoke to the ringleader Abu Hasan on the satellite phone. Muslim cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri in the street outside the closed Finsbury Park Mosque in London. He said: ‘I didn’t argue with him. I said to him I was a bit angry. He said don’t panic, these things happen in Yemen every day. I said this is different’. Hasan told him he wanted to be a martyr but Hamza told him that ‘this is not the platform’ to do so. Hamza issued a press release and gave a press conference at Conway Hall in London to try and put pressure on the Yemeni government not to attempt a rescue. But his efforts were unsuccessful and carnage ensued when the Yemeni army advanced. The terrorists who he had been talking to forced all 16 captives to stand on mounds and fired through their legs during the terrifying ordeal, the court has been told. Hamza, 56, who only has one eye and has stumps for hands, is also accused of trying to set up a terrorist training camp in Bly, Oregon and trying to facilitate jihad in Afghanistan. He denies all the charges and the trial at Manhattan’s Federal Court, which is in its fifth week, continues.

If Various statements of the ECP rule can now be reviewed., can we conclude that \\"There is still no way to review the statements.\\"?","output":"It is important to understand the context in which the ECP (Extended Consistent Parenthesization) rule is being discussed to assess if the statements can be reviewed or not. Assuming that ECP rules can now be reviewed as stated in the question, we cannot conclude that \\"There is still no way to review the statements.\\" Let's analyze this further. The ECP rule is a concept in context-free grammars (CFGs) and the parsing of programming languages. It is an extension of Consistent Parenthesization, which refers to a consistent way of adding parentheses around expressions following specific precedence rules. The ECP rule helps ensure the syntax of a program is well-formed and parsed correctly without ambiguity. Given that various statements of the ECP rule can now be reviewed, it implies that these rules have been established or updated in some manner, making it possible to analyze them. Here are some reasons that might have led to this conclusion: 1. New or Updated Guidelines: Developments and new insights might have come up with better definitions or standards for the ECP rule, enabling people to review them more effectively. 2. Improved Tools and Technologies: There might have been advancements in tools and technologies that can parse and process code, making it easier to review the ECP rule statements. These tools could include compilers, interpreters, parsers, or other software designed to analyze and interpret programming languages. 3. Research and Collaboration: Research could have led to the development of new methods to analyze and discuss the ECP rule among programming language experts and researchers, enabling the review of these statements. 4. Availability of Resources: Finally, there is a possibility that resources like articles, reference manuals, or books detailing the ECP rule may have become available or updated, thus facilitating the review process. In conclusion, given that the question states that various statements of the ECP rule can now be reviewed, the assumption would be that there are ways to review the statements. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \\"There is still no way to review the statements.\\" On the contrary, it suggests that the statements have become more accessible, possibly due to advancements in research, technology, resources, or guidelines, enabling individuals to review and analyze the ECP rule more effectively."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to English","output":"These tasks include the necessary steps to be taken in order to orient the country toward joining NATO. The statement in the original language refers to a series of tasks and responsibilities that need to be carried out to guide a nation towards membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). NATO is an intergovernmental military alliance between North American and European countries established in 1949. The primary purpose of NATO is to provide collective defense and ensure the security of its member states through political and military collaboration. For a country looking to join NATO, there are several requirements and conditions that need to be fulfilled before they can become a member. These include: 1. Commitment to democracy: A prospective member should demonstrate that it has a stable democratic political system, with respect for individual freedoms and the rule of law. 2. Civilian control of the military: There should be transparent and effective civilian control of the military institutions, ensuring that the armed forces operate under the principles and values of democracy. 3. Economic stability: Prospective members should possess a functioning market economy capable of addressing and adapting to the challenges of NATO membership. 4. Security and defense capabilities: A potential member should have a well-functioning security and defense system, capable of fulfilling the principle of collective defense and contributing to the security of the alliance. 5. Compliance with NATO standards: Prospective members should adopt NATO norms, procedures, and standards related to interoperability, communications, training, and logistics within their military structures. This ensures that countries can work effectively together in peacetime as well as in crisis situations. 6. Conflict resolution: Countries with unresolved territorial or ethnic disputes are expected to resolve these issues through peaceful means to promote regional stability and security. 7. Contributions to NATO missions: Aspiring members should demonstrate their commitment to NATO's values by actively contributing to the organization's missions, operations, and activities. Once these requirements are met, a country can initiate an official application for NATO membership through diplomatic channels. The application process involves a series of negotiations and intense dialogue between the aspiring member and the alliance. The decision for membership is reached by consensus among all current NATO member states. In summary, a country aiming to join NATO must undertake a series of specific tasks and responsibilities, such as demonstrating commitment to democratic principles, resolving conflicts peacefully, investing in defense capabilities, and adopting NATO standards. By successfully engaging in these tasks, a nation can eventually become a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, benefitting from the security guarantees and strategic partnerships inherent in the alliance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information:  - The Kashmiri Pandits (also known as Kashmiri Brahmins) are a Brahmin community from the Kashmir Valley, a mountainous region in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. They are the only remaining Hindu community native to the Kashmir Valley.  - Kashmir is the northernmost geographical region of the Indian subcontinent. Until the mid-19th century, the term \\"Kashmir\\" denoted only the valley between the Great Himalayas and the Pir Panjal mountain range. Today, it denotes a larger area that includes the Indian-administered territory of Jammu and Kashmir (subdivided into Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh divisions), the Pakistani-administered territories of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, and Chinese-administered territories of Aksai Chin and the Trans-Karakoram Tract.   - Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit (18 August 1900  1 December 1990) was an Indian diplomat and politician, the sister of Jawaharlal Nehru, the aunt of Indira Gandhi and the grand-aunt of Rajiv Gandhi, each of whom served as Prime Minister of India. Pandit was sent to London, as India's most important diplomat, after serving as Nehrus envoy to the Soviet Union, the USA and the United Nations. Her time in London offers insights into the wider context of changes in IndoBritish relations. Her High-Commissionership was a microcosm of inter-governmental relations.  - Rajiv Ratna Gandhi (20 August 1944  21 May 1991) was the Prime Minister of India, serving from 1984 to 1989. He took office after the 1984 assassination of his mother, Prime Minister Indira Priyadarshini Gandhi, to become the youngest Indian Prime Minister at the age of 40.  - The Prime Minister of India (Hindi:   , \\"Bhrat k Pradhnamantr\\") is the Head of Government and leader of the executive branch of the Government of India. The Prime Minister is also the chief adviser to the President of India and head of the Council of Ministers. He or she can be a member of any of the two houses of Parliament (the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha), but has to be the leader of the political party, having a majority in the Lok Sabha.  - Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (2 October 1869  30 January 1948) was the preeminent leader of the Indian independence movement in British-ruled India. Employing nonviolent civil disobedience, Gandhi led India to independence and inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahatma (Sanskrit: \\"high-souled\\", \\"venerable\\")applied to him first in 1914 in South Africais now used worldwide. In India, he is also called Bapu (Gujarati: endearment for \\"father\\", \\"papa\\") and Gandhiji. He is unofficially called the Father of the Nation.  - Indira Priyadarshini Gandhi (Nehru; 19 November 1917  31 October 1984) was an Indian politician and central figure of the Indian National Congress party, and to date the only female Prime Minister of India. Indira Gandhi was the daughter of India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. She served as Prime Minister from 1966 to 1977 and then again from 1980 until her assassination in 1984, making her the second-longest-serving Prime Minister of India after her father.  Gandhi served as her father's personal assistant and hostess during his tenure as prime minister between 1947 and 1964. She was elected Congress President in 1959. Upon her father's death in 1964, Gandhi refused to enter the Congress party leadership contest and instead chose to become a cabinet minister in the government led by Lal Bahadur Shastri. In the Congress Party's parliamentary leadership election held in early 1966, upon the death of Shastri, she defeated her rival, Morarji Desai, to become leader, and thus succeeded Shastri as Prime Minister of India.  - Jawaharlal Nehru (14 November 1889  27 May 1964) was the first Prime Minister of India and a central figure in Indian politics before and after independence. He emerged as the paramount leader of the Indian independence movement under the tutelage of Mahatma Gandhi and ruled India from its establishment as an independent nation in 1947 until his death in 1964. He is considered to be the architect of the modern Indian nation-state: a sovereign, socialist, secular, and democratic republic. He was also known as Pandit Nehru due to his roots with the Kashmiri Pandit community while many Indian children knew him as \\"Uncle Nehru\\" (\\"Chacha\\" Nehru).  - The Indian independence movement encompassed activities and ideas aiming to end the East India Company rule (17571858) and the British Indian Empire (18581947) in the Indian subcontinent. The movement spanned a total of 190 years (1757-1947).  - Krishna Nehru Hutheesing ( 1907 -- 1967 ) was an Indian writer , the youngest sister of Jawaharlal Nehru and Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit , and part of the Nehru - Gandhi family .

You must generate a detailed and long answer. If you're in a war what are you likely to have to do to another person? - make friend - fight enemy - conquer opponent - change society - kill  The best answer is A:","output":"In a war, individuals may face a variety of situations, each demanding different actions and responses. While each scenario has its significance, it is crucial to analyze the most prevalent aspects and consequences of being engaged in warfare. A: Fight enemy The act of fighting an enemy is an inherent aspect of warfare. Soldiers are usually trained to defend their homeland, protect their fellow citizens, and preserve the core values of their nation. Fighting the enemy can take many forms, such as engaging in direct combat, executing strategic missions, gathering intelligence, or offering support to allies. In essence, the primary objective is to weaken the opposition and gain an advantage, ultimately leading to victory. B: Conquer opponent Another key aspect of warfare is conquering the opponent. This involves not only defeating enemy forces on the battlefield but also occupying their territory, dismantling their political infrastructure, and ensuring the submission of the opposing nation. Conquering an opponent may also involve psychological warfare, in which misinformation and propaganda are employed to break the enemy's morale and unity. The end goal is to establish one's dominance and exert control over the defeated faction, either by installing a new government or directly ruling as an occupying power. C: Kill Warfare inevitably involves the taking of human lives. Soldiers are often required to kill enemy combatants to protect themselves, their comrades, and their nations' interests. While the notion of killing another person is morally complex and deeply unsettling, soldiers may also view it as a necessary step to achieve victory and restore peace. Moreover, in modern warfare, many deaths result from the use of advanced technology and weaponry, such as bombings, drone strikes, and missiles. Consequently, it is vital to recognize that killing is an inherent byproduct of war, regardless of whether it is committed intentionally or as collateral damage. D: Change society Wars can have far-reaching and long-lasting effects on society. The impact of warfare varies greatly depending on the nature, scope, and duration of the conflict, but some common consequences include economic disruption, physical devastation, population displacement, and social upheaval. As a participant in war, one might have to contribute to altering their society, either actively or passively. The process of societal change may involve the restructuring of political systems, reshaping cultural norms, or rebuilding infrastructure following the conflict's end. E: Make friends Although war is intrinsically characterized by conflict and struggle, it may also present opportunities for forging new relationships and alliances. Soldiers often develop a strong sense of camaraderie and loyalty to their comrades in arms, partly due to the shared experiences of training, combat, and adversity. Additionally, nations fighting common enemies may choose to establish partnerships or alliances, pooling their resources and working cooperatively to achieve a shared objective. Consequently, cultivating friendships in war—whether at the individual or national level—can prove advantageous by bolstering one's strength, resilience, and strategic capabilities. In conclusion, the best answer to the question \\"If you're in a war what are you likely to have to do to another person?\\" is multifaceted and cannot be limited to a single response. While all of the aforementioned aspects—fighting the enemy, conquering the opponent, killing, changing society, and making friends—are integral to the nature and consequences of warfare, their significance varies according to context and individual experiences. Understanding the complexities and moral implications of war requires examining each aspect and appreciating the multifarious and often contradictory roles and responsibilities one must confront."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: Mohammed Ali gifted it in an attempt to further his own interests. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"The premise given states that a monument or structure was erected in 1836 as a gift from Mohammed Ali, the viceroy of Egypt. The hypothesis posits that Mohammed Ali gifted it in an attempt to further his own interests. However, the premise does not directly entail the hypothesis, as it only provides information about the origin of the gift and the person responsible for it. To determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we would need to look deeper into the context and motivations behind Mohammed Ali's actions. From the premise alone, it is unclear why he chose to make this particular gift, and whether it was motivated by personal interests or more altruistic reasons. It is possible that Mohammed Ali's intentions were to promote goodwill between nations, celebrate a particular event, or foster cultural exchange – or, as the hypothesis suggests, to advance his own interests. If further historical context were provided, we may be able to evaluate whether the premise entails the hypothesis. For instance, if it is known that around this time Mohammed Ali was seeking political alliances, or was in negotiations that could benefit from offering such a gift, then the hypothesis may be more likely to be entailed by the premise. However, without additional context and supporting evidence, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. In summary, the premise about the gift from Mohammed Ali, the viceroy of Egypt, does not entail the hypothesis that it was given to further his own interests. More context and historical evidence are needed to evaluate the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Here are possible answers to this question: - closet - musical instrument store - instrument case - music shop - music store  I believe the correct choice is \\"instrument case\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"Storing a mandolin in an instrument case is indeed the correct and most appropriate choice for a number of reasons. Let us discuss these reasons in detail to understand why this answer is superior to the other options provided. 1. Protection: Instrument cases are designed specifically to protect musical instruments from various elements like dust, moisture, and impacts. They are usually well-padded and provide a snug fit to hold the instrument securely. Storing your mandolin in an instrument case will help in keeping it safe from accidental damages and ensure that it remains in perfect condition for a long time. 2. Portability: Instrument cases are often equipped with handles or shoulder straps, making it easy to transport your mandolin comfortably and safely. When you store your mandolin in an instrument case, you can easily carry it around to practice sessions, gigs, or music classes without any hassle. 3. Controlled Environment: When stored in an instrument case, your mandolin is away from direct sunlight, temperature fluctuations, and other environmental factors that may affect the instrument's condition. This helps in maintaining its tuning stability and overall playability.  4. Organization: Most instrument cases also have extra compartments or pockets to store essential accessories like picks, strings, tuners, etc. This keeps everything related to your mandolin organized and easily accessible whenever required. Now, let's discuss the other options briefly: - Closet: Storing your mandolin in a closet might seem convenient, but it also makes it vulnerable to damage or deformation due to overcrowding or improper storage. Moreover, closets may not provide adequate protection from environmental factors, leading to tuning instability. - Musical instrument store, music shop, or music store: These options imply that you would be temporarily or permanently giving away your mandolin to a third-party location. It is not feasible to store your instrument at a store, shop, or any other external place, as it would be inconvenient, costly, and could expose your instrument to potential theft or damage. In conclusion, storing your mandolin in an instrument case is the most suitable option as it ensures protection, portability, a controlled environment, and organization for your mandolin while keeping it within your possession. The other available options cannot provide a balance of safety, convenience, and accessibility in the same way an instrument case can."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is going to be a long day.","output":"In order to describe the sentiment of the tweet \\"Feel's ill. Shiiiit. This is going to be a long day.\\", we must first identify the key emotions and expressions that were used in the statement. Then, we can provide a comprehensive analysis of the overall mood, tone, and sentiment that the user is trying to convey. 1. Feel's ill: The user is expressing that they are not feeling well, most likely physically. This statement implies discomfort, uneasiness, or pain, which are associated with feelings of negativity. Since being unwell is not a pleasant experience, this further indicates that the sentiment being expressed here is negative. 2. Shiiiit: This interjection (a slightly vulgar, informal curse) is used to emphasize strong reactions to a situation, whether negative or positive. In this case, the sentiment is negative because the user is upset or distressed about feeling unwell. Furthermore, it can be assumed that the tweet's sentiment is intensified due to the punctuation and extra letters, reflecting the user's strong displeasure. 3. This is going to be a long day: The user predicts that their day is going to be long, which implies that they are expecting it to be challenging, tiring, or difficult to get through. When a person is physically unwell, enduring daily tasks might seem more draining or tedious than usual. Therefore, this statement suggests that the user dreads the prospect of a long day due to their current circumstance. Taking into consideration all the aforementioned phrases and emotions, the sentiment of the tweet \\"Feel's ill. Shiiiit. This is going to be a long day.\\" can be described as predominantly negative. The user is expressing their unhappiness by sharing feelings of discomfort and ill health, while also emphasizing their frustration and dread about the anticipated long day that lies ahead. Due to their current state of being unwell, they likely feel a decline in their overall mood and outlook on the day."},{"instruction":"The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person from whom the couple inherited the Brownlow estates? is inside the article: The Brownlow family, a dynasty of lawyers, began accumulating land in the Belton area from approximately 1598. In 1609 they acquired the reversion of the manor of Belton itself from the Pakenham family, who finally sold the manor house to Sir John Brownlow I in 1619. The old house was situated near the church in the garden of the present house and remained largely unoccupied, since the family preferred their other houses elsewhere. John Brownlow had married an heiress but was childless. He became attached to two of his more distant blood relations: a great-nephew, also called John Brownlow, and a great-niece, Alice Sherard. The two cousins married each other in 1676 when both were aged 16; three years later, the couple inherited the Brownlow estates from their great-uncle together with an income of £9,000 per annum (about £1.35 million in present-day terms) and £20,000 in cash (equivalent to about £3.01 million now). They immediately bought a town house in the newly fashionable Southampton Square in Bloomsbury, and decided to build a new country house at Belton.Work on the new house began in 1685. The architect thought to have been responsible for the initial design is William Winde, although the house has also been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, while others believe the design to be so similar to Roger Pratt's Clarendon House, London, that it could have been the work of any talented draughtsman. The assumption popular today, that Winde was the architect, is based on the stylistic similarity between Belton and Coombe Abbey, which was remodelled by Winde between 1682 and 1685. Further evidence is a letter dated 1690, in which Winde recommends a plasterer who worked at Belton to another of his patrons., can you guess it ?

Use evidence from the fact that chemical splashing can cause harm to the eyes to answer this question: \\"Make sure to protect your eyes when working with chemicals because they can easily do what if handled wrong\\"","output":"Make sure to protect your eyes when working with chemicals because they can easily cause harm, including irritation, chemical burns, or even blindness if handled incorrectly. Working with chemicals, especially those that are corrosive, acidic, alkaline, or have reactive properties, poses several potential dangers to the human eyes. When manipulated without proper safety measures, a chemical splash or accidental contact may occur, leading to the following negative consequences: 1. Eye irritation: Various chemicals, such as solvents or detergents, can cause mild to moderate irritation of the eye. This is characterized by redness, tearing, itching, and a burning sensation. In most cases, eye irritation can be treated effectively with flushing and over-the-counter eye drops, but persistent symptoms may require medical attention. 2. Chemical burns: Corrosive substances, such as strong acids (e.g., sulfuric or hydrochloric acid), strong bases (e.g., sodium or potassium hydroxide), and some oxidizing agents (e.g., hydrogen peroxide or bleach) can cause chemical burns upon contact with the eyes. These burns can range from superficial to deep, potentially causing irreversible damage to the cornea, sclera, conjunctiva, and other ocular tissues. Chemical burns are considered a medical emergency and require immediate treatment, including extensive flushing and professional care. 3. Phototoxicity: Some chemicals, particularly photosensitizers like certain drugs or industrial compounds, can cause phototoxic reactions upon exposure to light. When absorbed by the eye, these chemicals heighten the sensitivity of ocular tissues to light, resulting in inflammation, redness, and discomfort. Proper safety measures, such as avoiding sunlight or wearing appropriate sunglasses, should be taken when dealing with photosensitizing agents. 4. Allergic reactions: Some individuals may develop allergic reactions to specific chemicals, leading to localized ocular symptoms like itching, swelling, and redness. In such cases, an individual should avoid further contact with the allergen and seek medical assistance as needed. 5. Permanent blindness: In extreme cases, exposure to certain chemicals, particularly those with corrosive properties, can lead to permanent blindness. Such damage may result from severe chemical burns or direct harm to ocular structures, such as the retina and optic nerves. To prevent these detrimental consequences, proper eye protection should be worn when working with chemicals. Safety goggles or full-face shields made from durable, impact-resistant materials are designed to safeguard the eyes from chemical splashes and contact. Additionally, following standard laboratory procedures, handling chemicals with care, maintaining adequate ventilation, and knowing the properties of the substances in use, are all important aspects of eye safety when working with chemicals. In conclusion, it is crucial to protect your eyes when working with chemicals, as different substances can easily cause a range of harmful effects, including irritation, burns, or even permanent vision loss when handled improperly. By wearing the appropriate protective equipment and following established safety practices, the risk of chemical-related eye injuries can be significantly minimized."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Q: What do all sound waves begin with?

Archaeologists are set to excavate the buried remains of a sixth century chapel - which could be Britain's oldest place of Christian worship. St Piran's Oratory near Perranporth, Cornwall, has been encased in a concrete bunker for decades to protect it from the elements. But experts have finally been granted permission to remove the casing so they can begin excavating and preserving the medieval site. St Piran's Oratory is pictured in its protective shell in 1955. James Gossip, an archaeologist at Cornwall Council, said: 'This is a very important site and it will be amazing to see what is under the sand' Saint Piran was an early 6th-century Cornish abbot and saint from Ireland. He is the patron saint of tin-miners and the patron saint of Cornwall.

He then floated safely over the sea to land upon the sandy beach of Perranzabuloe in Cornwall. He was joined at Perranzabuloe by many of his Christian converts and together they founded the Abbey of Lanpiran, with Piran as abbot. Saint Piran 'rediscovered' tin-smelting - tin had been smelted in Cornwall since before the Romans' arrival, but the methods had since been forgotten - when his black hearthstone, a slab of tin-bearing ore, had the tin smelt out of it and rise to the top in the form of a white cross. This white cross then came to be the symbol of Cornwall. According to legend, St Piran, the patron saint of tinners, built the chapel and forged a white cross in a fire which went on to become the symbol of Cornwall. Engulfed by sand in the Middle Ages, the remains of the oratory were first discovered in the late 18th Century. There were two major digs in 1835 and 1843 that uncovered a number of skeletons - including one of large, headless man.

Question: what is sump pump  used for A:","output":"No, the provided answer does not clearly and completely answer the question, \\"What is a sump pump used for?\\". A more appropriate answer for this question would be: A sump pump is used for removing accumulated water from a sump basin or pit, typically located in the basement or crawlspace of a house or building. The primary purpose of a sump pump is to prevent flooding and water damage by rerouting excess water away from the foundation of the structure. This helps maintain structural integrity and reduce dampness or mold growth in the lower levels of the building. Sump pumps can be either submersible or pedestal types, and they are activated by a float switch when the water level in the sump basin reaches a certain point. Once activated, the sump pump removes the water by pumping it through a discharge pipe to a safe distance away from the property."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are the urban hubs that are within 6 miles of the ridge that picks up elevation again with the Pocumtuck Ridge? ?  The Metacomet Ridge picks up elevation again with the Pocumtuck Ridge, beginning on Sugarloaf Mountain and the parallel massif of Mount Toby, 1,269 feet (387 m), the high point of the Metacomet Ridge geography. Both Sugarloaf Mountain and Mount Toby are composed of erosion-resistant sedimentary rock. North of Mount Sugarloaf, the Pocumtuck Ridge continues as alternating sedimentary and traprock dominated strata to Greenfield, Massachusetts. From Greenfield north to 2 miles (3 km) short of the Vermont–New Hampshire–Massachusetts tri-border, the profile of the Metacomet Ridge diminishes into a series of nondescript hills and low, wooded mountain peaks composed of sedimentary rock with dwindling traprock outcrops.In Connecticut, the high point of the Metacomet Ridge is West Peak of the Hanging Hills at 1,024 feet (312 m); in Massachusetts, the highest traprock peak is Mount Tom, 1,202 feet (366 m), although Mount Toby, made of sedimentary rock, is higher. Visually, the Metacomet Ridge is narrowest at Provin Mountain and East Mountain in Massachusetts where it is less than 0.5 miles (1 km) wide; it is widest at Totoket Mountain, over 4 miles (6 km). However, low parallel hills and related strata along much of the range often make the actual geologic breadth of the Metacomet Ridge wider than the more noticeable ridgeline crests, up to 10 miles (16 km) across in some areas. Significant river drainages of the Metacomet Ridge include the Connecticut River and tributaries (Falls River, Deerfield River, Westfield River, Farmington River, Coginchaug River); and, in southern Connecticut, the Quinnipiac River.The Metacomet Ridge is surrounded by rural wooded, agricultural, and suburban landscapes, and is no more than 6 miles (10 km) from a number of urban hubs such as New Haven, Meriden, New Britain, Hartford, and Springfield. Small city centers abutting the ridge include Greenfield, Northampton, Amherst, Holyoke, West Hartford, Farmington, Wallingford, and Hamden. Answer:","output":"The urban hubs that are within 6 miles of the ridge that picks up elevation again with the Pocumtuck Ridge include New Haven, Meriden, New Britain, Hartford, and Springfield.

Please tell me if those questions are the same. Select from:  - no.  - yes.","output":"The answer is \\"no\\". The two questions are not the same; they aim to inquire about different aspects related to the same topic - a road named Aurangzeb in Delhi. The first question, \\"Why is there a road named Aurangzeb in Delhi?\\" is seeking an historical explanation or context to the naming. It assumes that there could be substantial historical or cultural reasons for having a road in Delhi named after Aurangzeb. To answer this, one would have to delve into history and possibly comprehend the legacy of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, as well as the history and city planning practices of Delhi. Aurangzeb was the sixth Mughal Emperor, ruling over most of the Indian subcontinent for nearly 50 years from 1658 until his death in 1707. His reign, controversial as it may be, undeniably constitutes an important part of Indian history. Delhi, being the capital city of India, hosts various sites and structures named after figures in Indian history, Mughal or otherwise. This includes Aurangzeb Road, which was named to mark his influence and rule.  The second question, however, \\"How do you justify naming a road after Aurangzeb?\\" implicates normative judgments and ethical or political considerations based upon the historical figure of Aurangzeb. The question infers that the act of having a road named after Aurangzeb might be controversial or objectionable, thereby necessitating justification. In this context, Aurangzeb is often remembered for his religious orthodoxy and uncompromising militarism, with critics arguing that his rule was marked by tyranny, forced religious conversions, and destruction of Hindu temples. Those who oppose the naming of the road after Aurangzeb cite these aspects of his rule. In response, some argue that naming a road does not necessarily equate to glorifying a figure, but recognizing them as an undeniable part of history, while others propose renaming based upon contemporary values and ethics. In conclusion, while both questions relate to the Aurangzeb Road in Delhi, they seek different facets of understanding - one being historical and factual, the other ethical and interpretive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When her grandmother needs to go to a nursing home, Carrie has to move in with her father Hank, a rancher in Wyoming, whom she hasn't seen since she was a baby. Initially reluctant to adapt to country living, Carrie soon meets Flicka, a beautiful black Mustang that previously had belonged to Carrie's cousin Katy, who asked Hank to look after Flicka when her father sold their own ranch. Flicka is wild and dangerous and, according to the ranchers, longs for Katy. However, when Carrie is attacked by a rattlesnake, Flicka saves her and the two form a bond. Carrie also meets Jake, an attractive ranch hand hoping to become a country singer, and Amy Walker, the proud and arrogant daughter of a neighbour. Although Jake and Carrie take an immediate liking to each other, there is instant animosity between Carrie and Amy, mainly because Amy also likes Jake. When Carrie disobeys her father's rules regarding visits to the nearest town, Hank decides to punish Carrie by temporarily relocating Flicka to the farm of one of his ranch hands, Toby. After a midnight visit by Carrie, Flicka tries to follow Carrie home to Hank's ranch, but accidentally ends up on the ranch belonging to Amy's father HD Walker.

Do these two sentences convey the same information? Choices:  (A). no.  (B). yes.","output":"(B). yes. Both sentences convey the same information despite the slight difference in their structure. They tell us about three key events: the seizure of Valerin's castle, the killing of Valerin himself, and the release of the queen. The only structural difference between the two sentences is the use of the passive voice in the second sentence, which emphasizes that the queen is the one being released. In Sentence 1, \\"the queen released\\" uses the active voice, implying that the queen is responsible for releasing herself from captivity. However, the context of the sentence suggests that Valerin's death has caused her to be freed, so her agency in the action is not as important as the event itself. In Sentence 2, \\"the queen is released\\" employs the passive voice and places more emphasis on the action of the queen being released, rather than specifying who or what is causing her release. This construction is more focused on the outcome of Valerin's death and the castle's seizure. Despite these slight structural differences, both sentences effectively communicate the same information.

The Obama administration's top environmental official in the oil-rich South and Southwest region has resigned after Republicans targeted him over remarks made two years ago when he used the word \\"crucify\\" to describe his approach to enforcement.      In a letter to EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson sent Sunday, Al Armendariz says he regrets his words and stresses that they do not reflect his work as administrator of the five-state region including Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana.      Republicans in Congress had called for Armendariz' firing, after Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe highlighted the May 2010 speech last week as proof of what he refers to as EPA's assault on energy, particularly the technique of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.      Several disputed contamination cases in Texas have helped stoke environmental concerns over fracking. ||||| A top administrator for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has apologized for using the word \\"crucify\\" two years ago when describing the agency's enforcement policies, and for saying it makes examples of bad players in the oil and gas industry.      EPA Region 6 administrator Al Armendariz, who oversees Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana and New Mexico, issued a written apology Wednesday after video surfaced of him at a meeting in May 2010 in the tiny town of Dish.      The video shows Armendariz answering a question about the agency's enforcement policies. In the Middle Ages, he tells the crowd, the Romans would enter a troublesome village, \\"take the first five guys they saw and crucify them.\\" Then the town would be \\"really easy to manage for the next few years,\\" he said.      The EPA also makes \\"examples of people who are not complying with the law, you make examples out of them, use it as a deterrent method,\\" Armendariz continued. \\"Companies that are smart see that and they don't want to play that, and they decide at that point that it's time to clean up.\\"      To some Republicans and conservatives, the comments justified their long-standing allegation that the EPA under President Barack Obama has stepped up enforcement to a point where it is harming the economy and the energy industry. The EPA also has become a popular target on the campaign trail, and Republican presidential contender Mitt Romney has in the past called for EPA chief Lisa P. Jackson to be fired.      Armendariz's apology was issued Wednesday by the EPA's headquarters in Washington.      \\"I apologize to those I have offended and regret my poor choice of words. It was an offensive and inaccurate way to portray our efforts to address potential violations of our nation's environmental laws,\\" he said. \\"I am always and have been committed to fair and vigorous enforcement of those laws.\\"      Cynthia Giles, the assistant administrator for enforcement and compliance assurance, also issued a statement.      \\"Strong, fair and effective enforcement of the environmental laws passed by Congress is critical to protecting public health and ensuring that all companies, regardless of industry, are playing by the same rules,\\" she wrote.      Dish is a town north of Dallas where residents' concerns over the environmental impacts of a new method of gas drilling helped put the issue on the national stage.      Testing showed some groundwater contamination and elevated toxic air pollution after operators began using a new method _ a combination of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, and horizontal drilling _ to extract once out-of-reach natural gas from impermeable layers of the Barnett shale.      The EPA helped test the town's water and air, and the drillers changed some methods. Armendariz traveled to the town of 200 people to talk to residents.      On Thursday, at the White House press briefing, press secretary Jay Carney was asked whether Armendariz's comments proved that the EPA's enforcement practices were unfair, such as in Pennsylvania, where testing has shown that allegations of groundwater contamination caused by fracking are false.      Carney denied that.

Background: Mohanlal Viswanathan was born in the village of Elanthoor in the Pathanamthitta district on 21 May 1960. He is the youngest child of Viswanathan Nair, a former bureaucrat and law secretary with the Kerala Government, and Santhakumari. He grew up at Mudavanmugal, Poojappura, at his paternal house in Thiruvananthapuram. Mohanlal studied at Government Model Boys Higher Secondary School, Thiruvananthapuram and graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce degree from Mahatma Gandhi College in Thiruvananthapuram. Context: Mohanlal had acted in several amateur plays before entering into films. In 2001, he debuted in professional drama playing Karna (a character from the Indian epic Mahabharata) in Karnabharam, a Sanskrit-language play directed by Kavalam Narayana Panicker. It premiered at the Siri Fort Auditorium in New Delhi on 29 March 2001 as part of the National Theatre Festival of the National School of Drama. The play depicts Karna's mental agony a day before the Kurukshetra War, as he thinks about his past and his faith. Mohanlal said: \\"You cannot compare Kavalam's play with the amateur plays I did. Though there are other characters in the play, the theme revolves around Karna. It is almost like a solo performance. Some of the scenes are really touching and challenging\\". He acted without payment, saying: \\"I performed for the joy of it ... for my love of our history\\".  Kadhayattam was a presentation enacted by Mohanlal, performing ten classic characters and situations from Malayalam literature, selected from ten Malayalam novels written by O. Chandu Menon, C. V. Raman Pillai, S. K. Pottekkatt, Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai, P. Kesavadev, Vaikom Muhammad Basheer, Uroob, O. V. Vijayan, M. Mukundan, and M. T. Vasudevan Nair over a 100-year period. The play, directed by T. K. Rajeev Kumar premiered at the Senate Hall of University of Kerala on 1 November 2003, and later was staged in Kozhikode, Bangalore, Chennai and Delhi. In 2008, Mohanlal along with Mukesh performed in Chayamukhi, written and directed by Prasanth Narayanan. Mohanlal and Mukesh portrayed Bheeman and Keechakan respectively, the characters from Mahabharata. It had a play within a play narrative style. It premiered at the Lulu International Convention Centre in Thrissur on 12 March 2008, and later was staged in Thiruvananthapuram, Bangalore, Kollam, Kochi, and Kozhikode. A critic from The Hindu wrote: \\"Chayamukhi is, arguably, the finest work on Malayalam stage in recent times\\". In the same year, Mohanlal voiced Hanuman in the English ballet Maya Ravan, directed by Shobana.  In 2014, Mohanlal and musician Ratheesh Vegha formed the music band Lalisom - The Lal Effect. Its maiden show was at the 2015 National Games of India. The band drew flak from social media initially for charging an amount of Rs1.63 crore and later for lip-syncing. Following the criticism, Mohanlal returned the amount to the government, which they refused stating that the government's morality would not allow to take back the money and Mohanlal had not personally benefited from the amount which he received, since it was meant to meet the stage expenses and remuneration for the artistes. Despite that, Mohanlal did not take back the money he dispatched.  In 2015, he collaborated once again with Mukesh for Naga, but this time as the narrator. The play, based on Girish Karnad's Kannada play Nagamandala, was directed by Suveeran. Naga was a combination of myth, superstition, fact, and fantasy. It was premiered at the Parish Hall of St. George Church, Kalady on 9 August 2015. Question: did he have a partner?. Whats the answer?","output":"Mohanlal Viswanathan, the renowned Indian actor, did collaborate with various artists and creative professionals throughout his career. In the context of his theater performances, notably, he partnered with fellow actor Mukesh in two productions, Chayamukhi (2008) and Naga (2015). In Chayamukhi, they portrayed the characters Bheeman and Keechakan, while in Naga, Mohanlal served as the narrator. Although they were professional collaborators, Mohanlal did not have a consistent partner like a duo in his career, as he worked with a variety of actors, directors, and creative professionals across his extensive body of work in theater, films, and music."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer a question about this article: The origins of the department store lay in the growth of the conspicuous consumer society at the turn of the 19th century. As the Industrial Revolution accelerated economy expansion, the affluent middle-class grew in size and wealth. This urbanized social group, sharing a culture of consumption and changing fashion, was the catalyst for the retail revolution. As rising prosperity and social mobility increased the number of people, especially women (who found they could shop unaccompanied at department stores without damaging their reputation), with disposable income in the late Georgian period, window shopping was transformed into a leisure activity and entrepreneurs, like the potter Josiah Wedgwood, pioneered the use of marketing techniques to influence the prevailing tastes and preferences of society. What social group grew as a result of the industrial revolution?","output":"The social group that grew as a result of the Industrial Revolution was the affluent middle-class. The Industrial Revolution led to substantial economic expansion, which in turn created more wealth and opportunities for individuals working in various sectors, such as manufacturing, trade, and services. This resulted in a significant increase in the size and purchasing power of the middle-class, making them a driving force behind the emergence of the conspicuous consumer society at the turn of the 19th century. As this newly affluent middle-class started to urbanize and share a culture of consumption and changing fashion, they became instrumental in the retail revolution that gave rise to the department store. This social group demonstrated their newfound status by adopting new consumption habits and displaying their wealth through the purchase of various goods and fashionable items. This phenomenon particularly impacted women who, during this period, found that they could shop unaccompanied at department stores without damaging their reputation. As a result, their disposable income and personal autonomy increased, transforming window shopping into a popular leisure activity. Entrepreneurs like Josiah Wedgwood recognized this emerging market and utilized innovative marketing techniques to influence the prevailing tastes and preferences of the affluent middle-class, ultimately shaping the way the retail industry operated during that time."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

'Idiot': Zara Phillips  and her husband, pictured here together at Cheltenham, disagreed over the choice to buy into the horse. Monbeg Dude is now worth a reported £200,000, after costing just £12,000. GoggleBox intellectual William Hartston, 66, spent days carefully studying the statistics from every single Grand National which has taken place since 1886. He then used a complex formula which included the bookies' odds, age of the horse, the letters in the owner's name, and the letters and number of words in the horses' names. And he concluded Monbeg, who is trained by Michael Scudamore and will be ridden by top jockey Paul Carberry, has the best chance of winning the race. Hartston said: 'This year's scoring system is based on a re-analysis of the results of all Aintree Grand Nationals since 1886.

'Unlike last year, I have given a weighting towards recent years and added an item relating to the name of the trainer. 'I would have liked to include the name of the jockey too, but in many cases this is not available until the morning of the race. 'Had I been able to do so last year, Seabass would not have been my top choice: no jockey whose first name begins with K has ever won the Grand National, so Katie Walsh stood very little chance.

A 103-year-old believed to be Britain’s oldest punter is hoping for a winner on this year’s Grand National - after betting on the race for more than seven decades without success. George Atkinson said he is hoping to finally have a successful bet on the world-famous race, so he can 'die a happy man'. Mr Atkinson has placed bets religiously on the Grand National each year since the 1940s. George Atkinson, a 103-year-old who is believed to be Britain's oldest punter, is hoping for a winner on this year's Grand National - after betting on the race for more than seven decades without success. That's a lot of birthdays! George says he would 'die a happy man' if he finally wins this year. But he has never managed to back a winner, and fears the 2014 race is his last chance. And after such a long run of betting, he has decided to pin his hopes on 2011 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Long Run, owned by Robert Waley-Cohen and trained by Nicky Henderson. Mr Atkinson said: 'Any winner is nice - but the national would be a dream come true - I could die a happy man.' The 103-year-old, from Swaffham, Norfolk, placed his first bet on the Grand National in the 1940s after leaving the Army. He had placed his first ever bet when he was just 12, when his bookmaker grandfather took him to the Epsom Derby. He said: 'I can’t remember the name as it lost - in fact they all lose. I’ve never even had a place.'I was once told to back Oxo in 1959 but I didn’t place a bet on it - it won and I’ve regretted it for 55 years.' George has pin his hopes on 2011 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Long Run. The Grand National is not the only competition Mr Atkinson has a flutter on - winning £301 from a £1 stake in 2013 by correctly predicting three of the numbers on the Irish Lottery. 'Horses are my favourite, but I love a dog race too,' he said. 'Number seven is my lucky number, but I’m not the luckiest punter.' The widowed father-of-seven, who is a grandfather and great-grandfather, goes to his local branch of bookmaker William Hill in Swaffham twice a day and even celebrated his 103rd birthday there. Believed to be Britain’s oldest punter, the company has given him a £103 bet - £51.50 each way - as he tries to fulfil his dream of a Grand National win. He has decided to put it on Long Run - whose odds of winning are currently at 14/1 - and said: 'It has been a long run without a winner and it feels like my time.' Happy punter: 'Horses are my favourite, but I love a dog race too' William Hill took more than five million bets on the Grand National last year and is expected to accept over £30 million in wagers in 2014. According to the bookmakers, around 57 per cent of Britain’s adult population is expected to place a bet on the Grand National, with 51 per cent of those who bet making their selection based on personal preferences. Based on a survey of 2,066 people conducted for the firm by Populus, 36 per cent of people will choose a horse by name; 17 per cent make their selection by odds; 9 per cent will leave it purely to chance, and make a random selection; and just 2 per cent will pick because of the colours worn by the jockey. Yvonne Dobinson, manager of William Hill Swaffham, said: 'George is living proof of how hard it is to win the Grand National with over 70 years failing to pick a winner. 'But he has picked a corker this year and even we will be cheering Long Run on for his sake.'

Since 21 September 2015 , the Minister has been Senator the Hon Simon Birmingham . There was also an Assistant Minister for Education and Training until 21 September 2015 .  - South Australia (abbreviated as SA) is a state in the southern central part of Australia. It covers some of the most arid parts of the country. With a total land area of , it is the fourth-largest of Australia's states and territories. It has a total of 1.7 million people, and its population is the most highly centralised of any state in Australia, with more than 75 percent of South Australians living in the capital, Adelaide, or its environs. Other population centres in the state are relatively small.  - Simon John Birmingham (born 14 June 1974), an Australian politician, is a member of the Australian Senate representing South Australia as a member of the Liberal Party since 2007.

Answer the following question: The ionization energies of the representative elements generally decrease from top to bottom within a group. This trend is explained by the increase in size of the atoms within a group. The valence electron that is being removed is further from the nucleus in the case of a larger atom. The attractive force between the valence electron and the nucleus weakens as the distance between them increases and as the shielding effect increases, resulting in a lower ionization energy for the larger atoms within a group. Although the nucl  Jeremy is studying the periodic table in preparation for a chemistry test next week. Today he is focusing on the elements that all belong to the alkali metals group. He is especially focused on learning about lithium, which is at the top of the group, and cesium, which is at the bottom of the alkali metals group.  Which element is smaller? Answer:","output":"Lithium is the smaller element when comparing it to cesium, both of which belong to the alkali metals group in the periodic table. This size difference is due to the fact that as you go down a group, each element has an additional energy level or shell compared to the element above it.  Lithium, with the atomic number of 3, only has two energy levels (1s and 2s) while Cesium, with the atomic number of 55, has 6 energy levels (1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f, 5s, 5p, 5d, 6s). This increased number of energy levels or electron shells in Cesium results in a larger atomic radius because the outermost electrons are located further from the nucleus, causing the atomic size to expand. This size increase down the group is connected to the shield effect. With each new energy level, there is an added electron shield between the outermost valence electrons and the positively charged nucleus. This reduces the attractive force exerted on the outermost electrons by the nuclear charge, enabling them to stay further out which results in a larger atom. Furthermore, the distances between the nucleus and electrons in larger atoms like Cesium can also cause the differences we observe in ionization energies, as it takes less energy to remove an electron from a larger atom, like cesium, than it does to remove it from a smaller atom, like lithium. Thus, the trend in atomic size is inherently linked to the trend of ionization energy within the periodic table. So, when studying the periodic table, Jeremy will notice that atoms generally get larger as you descend a group, much like how Cesium is larger than Lithium in the alkali metal group."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns. The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname. The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by Theodore W. Drake in 1964, the leprechaun was first used on the football pocket schedule and later on the football program covers.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In certain cases compound words and set phrases may be contracted into single characters. Some of these can be considered logograms, where characters represent whole words rather than syllable-morphemes, though these are generally instead considered ligatures or abbreviations (similar to scribal abbreviations, such as & for \\"et\\"), and as non-standard. These do see use, particularly in handwriting or decoration, but also in some cases in print. In Chinese, these ligatures are called héwén (合文), héshū (合書) or hétǐzì (合体字), and in the special case of combining two characters, these are known as \\"two-syllable Chinese characters\\" (双音节汉字, 雙音節漢字). If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What are logograms?","output":"Logograms are symbols or characters that represent a whole word or a meaningful unit of language, rather than an individual sound or syllable-morpheme. They are a type of written character found in various writing systems, including Chinese characters, Egyptian hieroglyphs, and Mayan glyphs, among others. Logograms convey meaning directly through their visual representation and do not necessarily correspond to the phonetic sounds of spoken language. In a logographic writing system, each character denotes a word or a significant part of a word, which can include things like nouns, verbs, adjectives, or grammatical particles. This is in contrast to phonographic writing systems, such as the Latin script used in English, where characters typically represent individual sounds or phonemes. As a result, logographic systems tend to have a large number of distinct characters, since they need to account for the wide variety of words and concepts in a language. There are several advantages and disadvantages of using logograms. One advantage is that logographic writing can be more concise, as a single character can represent an entire word or concept. This can make writing more efficient, especially for languages with many monosyllabic words, like Chinese. Logograms can also be more readily understood by speakers of different languages or dialects, since the meaning of the character is not tied to pronunciation. On the other hand, mastering a logographic writing system can be more challenging, as it requires learning a large number of individual characters. Furthermore, representing new words or concepts can prove difficult, since they might necessitate the creation of entirely new logograms. Finally, logographic systems can be less flexible in terms of adapting to changes in language, as the visual form of a character might not easily accommodate shifts in pronunciation or meaning. Despite these challenges, logographic writing systems have been used throughout history and across various cultures. Today, they still remain an important component of modern languages like Chinese, Japanese (where they coexist with phonetic scripts, such as hiragana and katakana), and Korean (in the form of Hanja, albeit to a lesser extent compared to the Hangul script). The use and evolution of logograms continue to provide valuable insights into human language and communication, as well as the cognitive aspects of reading and writing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Northern region where the animals are exposed to a lot of abiotic stress, and the southern region, where the animals experience almost no abiotic stress.  Which region had more species go extinct?  Hint: Biodiversity is determined by many things, and one of them is abiotic stress. If an environment is highly stressful, biodiversity tends to be low. If abiotic stress does not have a strong presence in an area, the biodiversity will be much higher.This idea leads into the understanding of how abiotic stress and endangered species are related. It has been observed through a variety of environments that as the level of abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases. This means that species are more likely to become population threatened, endangered, and even extinct, when and where abiotic stress is especially harsh. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, the Northern region of Italy, where animals are exposed to a higher level of abiotic stress, would likely have experienced more species going extinct compared to the Southern region, where the animals experience almost no abiotic stress. As abiotic stress increases, biodiversity tends to decrease, making species more susceptible to becoming threatened, endangered, and eventually extinct.

And in many ways, a very good one. My first thought after viewing, was how the hell are they going to market this thing? If Shaun of the Dead is a romantic comedy with zombies, Fido is a boy and his dog story blended with fifties nostalgia comedy with zombies. Doesn't exactly trip off the tongue. Fido has little of Shaun's carnage, gore & belly laughs. It is a different beast altogether (forgive the pun). Fido kicks off with a black & white information film that explains the back story - humans have won a war against zombies by developing a control collar that subdues the flesh-eaters into dumb servants. At first I thought we we were in for a fifties cold war paranoia parody a la Matinée, but we are soon hurled into a world of bright primary colours and fifties middle-class nostalgia.

Seeking to keep up with the Joneses, mom (Carry-Anne Moss) has acquired a zombie. Jimmy is disinterested at first, but 'Fido' (Billy Conelley) soon proves a great buddy for Jimmy. Until his collar goes on the blink... Fido is NOT a horror film, but my problem with the movie is figuring out exactly what it IS. Much of the humour is of the light family variety, and sometimes the plot line is too heavily reliant on the boy and his dog/family moments. Yet the film is shot through with wonderfully dark, truly funny moments, which while welcome, will ensure an R rating for what is, for extended periods, a family comedy.

Paul Von Cram, who is so captivated by their appearance - especially Karen's - that he offers to carry their suitcases up to their hotel suite. Because of this the two women mistake Paul for a bellboy. Paul decides to cancel his imminent date with socialite woman Peg Manning, since he now has his eyes set on Karen. He then sends Karen a note at the hotel, asking her to meet \\"a lieutenant\\" at the hotel bar. Karen is intrigued by this and has no idea that it is Paul she is meeting. She makes a makeshift dress out of the curtains in the suite and goes down to meet the lieutenant. Arriving at the bar she instantly realises her earlier mistake. Jenny discovers that they have been listed as thieves and wanted refugees from the law in a newspaper article. In a desperate attempt to hide this from the people at the hotel she buys every available newspaper she can find.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Americans may become accustomed to the political turmoil swirling around President Donald Trump, but it remains an open question whether that turmoil will ultimately help or hurt Trump and his Republican allies, especially in an election year. Last week, it was Trump's firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and an apparent Democratic victory in a special congressional election in Pennsylvania — a sign of a possible wave in the November midterm elections. This week, it was a series of presidential tweets criticizing the Russia probe, followed by a controversial Trump statement of congratulations for newly re-elected Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump also added former U.S. attorney Joseph diGenova to his legal team. DiGenova has alleged that elements of the FBI and the Department of Justice have been out to frame Trump in connection with the Russia probe. Trump ignored shouted questions Tuesday from reporters at the White House who asked whether he wanted to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the Russia probe. Earlier, House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, told reporters at the Capitol that he had received \\"assurances\\" that firing Mueller was \\"not even under consideration.\\" The latest back and forth over the Mueller investigation came after several days of presidential tweets complaining about the probe, including one blasting it as a \\"total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest.\\" The tweets sparked new fears that Trump might try to have Mueller fired. Some Republicans warned that an attempt to fire Mueller could put Trump's presidency in jeopardy. \\"I think anything directed at firing Mr. Mueller blows up the whole town, and that becomes the end of governing and the presidency as we know it,\\" cautioned Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. The renewed focus on the Russia probe came in the wake of last week's firing of Tillerson. That, in turn, raised the prospect of more administration changes. Question: why does Trump continue tweeting? Options: - not enough information - he has a large ego - he thinks it is helping. - he thinks he is witty Answer:","output":"Not enough information"},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

We'll start with the equation: 9902595 * a - 9902629 * a - 1768 = 0 Now, let's find the difference between the number of apples (a) in both groups: (9902595 - 9902629) * a - 1768 = 0 The difference between 9902595 and 9902629 is -34, so the equation becomes: -34 * a - 1768 = 0 Next, we want to isolate the apples (a). To do that, let's add 1768 to both sides of the equation: -34 * a = 1768 Now, we need to find how many apples (a) we have. To do that, let's divide both sides by -34: a = 1768 / -34 When we perform the division, we find that a equals -52: a = -52 So, the answer is -52 apples."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

On September 11, Israel announced its decision to remove him, following several Palestinian suicide bomb attacks on Israel. \\"He should be punished for the killings,\\" an Israeli official said, \\"He has done nothing to stop the terrorist groups.\\" But the decision has angered many other countries. China said that Arafat is the true leader, elected by the Palestinian people, and removing him would harm the peace in the Middle East. Other governments share this idea. Arafat himself said: \\"They can kill me, but never get me out of my country.\\" He has spent most of his life in danger as the most important aim of Israel. But, just like a cat with nine lives, Arafat escaped every time. For years he has made a practice of sleeping in a different bed each night, thinking a moving person is harder to hit. In 1985, Israel sent fighter planes to kill Arafat. The wild bombing destroyed his office in Tunis but Arafat himself was unhurt. In 1992, the aircraft in which he was flying over North Africa broke in two during a crash landing. The pilot was killed but he managed to remain alive. What is so unbelievable is that he always remains calm in great danger. Israeli tanks and planes attacked his office building in Ram Allah in December 2001. When they saw the attackers coming, Arafat's bodyguards  _ his orders to stay still and carried him to safety underground. Seconds later, several bombs were dropped nearby. Though safe, his bodyguards were so frightened that they were wet in sweat. But, Arafat, with Israeli tanks only 200 meters away, showed no fear at all. He stayed in the damaged office, talking by phone with foreign leaders in hope of preventing further attacks from Israel.  All these experiences have made him a beloved leader to his people and an enemy to some others. But has he used up the last of his nine lives? Only time will tell. According to the passage, which statement is true? A) In 1992, Arafat's plane crashed in South Africa. B) Israeli officers thought Arafat himself sent the terrorist groups to Israel. C) China is the only country against Israel's decision of removing Arafat. D) Being Palestinian leader, Arafat would rather die in his own country than be driven away from his people.

Let me explain these questions for you: 1. To connect a USB pen drive to an iPhone using an OTG cable, follow these steps:   a. First, you need a special cable called \\"Lightning to USB Camera Adapter\\" or \\"Lightning to USB 3 Camera Adapter\\" (for newer iPhones). These cables have a lightning connector on one side (to connect to your iPhone) and a USB port on the other side (to connect the pen drive).   b.

Your iPhone will automatically open the Files app to show the contents on your pen drive. You can view and manage files there! 2. It is possible to use a USB OTG cable to connect two phones together, but with a few conditions:   a. Both phones should be Android phones because iPhones don't support USB OTG natively.   b. Connect a USB OTG cable to the first phone (Phone A) and a regular USB cable to the second phone (Phone B).   c. Connect the USB ends of both cables to each other using a USB female-to-female adapter.   d. Once the connection is established, you might be able to access files and photos from Phone A on Phone B.

Metals conduct electricity and heat very well because of their free-flowing electrons. As electrons enter one end of a piece of metal, an equal number of electrons flow outward from the other end. When light is shone on to the surface of a metal, its electrons absorb small amounts of energy and become excited into one of its many empty orbitals. The electrons immediately fall back down to lower energy levels and emit light. This process is responsible for the high luster of metals.   Q: Why does metal conduct heat and electricity so well?

However, the star here is Dan Fogler, in a Jack Black kind of role as a Ping Pong protégé turned has-been, Randy Daytona. The acting is fine, and its always great to see Christopher Walken back on screen. The story is pretty much a by-the-numbers spoof of Bruce Lees Enter the Dragon, with some James Bond, Scarface and every clichéd martial arts film ever made. The script, the bread and butter of every comedy, is only passable, with more smiles and chuckles than laughs.Randy Daytona loses the 1988 Olympic Gold medal for ping-pong, and his father on the same day, and becomes a has-been haunted by his line, Im going to Disneyland. Daytona gets another chance when he is approached by FBI agent, Ernie Rodriguez (played by George Lopez), to go undercover at an underground ping-pong tournament run by the evil criminal emperor, Feng (Walken).

Last year, the Scottish capital was captivated by a series of intricate book sculptures, mysteriously gracing various locations in the city—silent love-letters to art, left by an invisible admirer. This year, this enigmatic artist has returned, intertwining mystery with creativity all over again, producing five new riveting works of book craft.

Blood Legacy starts with the arrival of lawyer Tom Drake (Norman Bartold) to the Dean estate formerly owned by the now deceased Christopher Dean (John Carradine), upon his arrival he is greeted by Mr. Dean's four children, Gregory (Jeff Morrow) & his wife Laura (Merry Anders), Victoria (Faith Domergue), Johnny (Richard Davalos) plus Leslie (Brooke Mills) & her fella Carl Isenberg (John Smith). Drake plays a tape recording of they're late Father's wishes after his death, the estate worth 136 million dollars is to be split equally between his four children, if any should die then the money would be split equally between the rest & if all were to die the freaky servants Elga (Ivy Bethune), Igor (Buck Kartalian) & the more mundanely named Frank (John Russell) would pocket the lot. Well, not satisfied with a quarter share of 136 million (which is still almost 35 million back in 1971 which doesn't sound too bad to me) someone decides they want it all for themselves & it's not long before decapitated heads are turning up in the fridge... Co-written, produced & directed by Roy Monson Blood Legacy disappointed me on two accounts. For starters this film's alternate & much more common title is Legacy of Blood which is also the title of an obscure horror film directed by Andy Milliagn back in '78 which I've always wanted to see, both films are regularly mixed up as both have similar stories & when I checked my on screen cable TV guide for Legacy of Blood I was excited because it said it was the Milligan film & even listed him as director so when I actually sat down to watch it & I heard John Carradine's voice & I then knew it wasn't the Milligan film that I had wanted to see, my heart sank. Then, of course, there's the simple yet undeniably straight forward fact that Blood Legacy is a total utter piece of crap that is literally painful to watch at times. The script by Monson & Eric Norden is slow, boring & extremely predictable. The character's are absolutely bizarre in an annoying way, the freak of a servant who ask's his sister (?) to cane him, the strange set of Brother's & Sisters who are just downright unlikeable & so far removed from reality that any tension or mystery that the simplistic whodunit story could have achieved is sorely missing & then there's the awful twist ending that you can guess within the first 10 minutes. It's boring to watch, it's poorly paced & it's just a chore to even think about it. Please, someone save me as this is really bad stuff. I could go on all day about how bad Blood Legacy is, I really could. Director Monson was either working with a none existent budget or judging by this he shouldn't have even been directing traffic. The entire film looks ugly, it's poorly photographed & there is no atmosphere or scares. The blood & gore is tame, there's an axe in a head, a decapitated head, a scene when someone is stung to death by wasp's & the best murder when someone's face is eaten by piranha. However there are question marks over this scene, so there's the victim, right. There's the tank of piranha, right. Victims head is placed in piranha tank, right. Pirahna eat victims face, right. Water remains crystal clear despite said victim having his face eaten, erm where's the blood? Technically Blood Legacy is terrible, it looks awful, the sound was obviously shot live & it's muffled & hard to hear which considering the terrible dialogue is maybe a blessing in disguise. The acting was not going to win anyone any awards that's for sure, the least said about it the better. Blood Legacy is an awful film, there really isn't a single positive aspect to it or if there is I can't think of it.

Allow each bead with a hole to dry completely. See instructions above for remaining steps.","output":"The article provides instructions on how to handle and dry beads during a crafting or jewelry-making process. It emphasizes the importance of setting the beads out to dry on a wire rack instead of allowing them to dry completely. This intermediate drying stage ensures that the beads are still slightly wet so they can be better manipulated, making it easier for artisans to work with them. To begin with, the beads should be carefully placed on a wire rack, ensuring that they are evenly spaced. This prevents them from sticking together and allows proper airflow, facilitating even drying. It is important not to let the beads dry completely at this stage, as they may become too brittle or stiff, and this could hinder the overall beadwork execution or jeopardize the project. For beads with holes in them, the drying process should be completed until they are entirely dry. This ensures that the hole stays intact and can be used to connect different beads or components when creating jewelry, accessories, or other craft projects. After achieving the proper drying level for each type of bead, users should refer to the specified instructions on any additional necessary steps. These steps might include stringing, painting, glazing, or any other required technique depending on the specific project being undertaken. In summary, the drying process of beads is an essential aspect of crafting and creating unique accessories. The article reminds users to carefully dry the beads on a wire rack, preventing them from drying too much or too little. Additionally, it highlights the importance of paying attention to drying beads differently according to their type or use, e.g., beads with or without holes.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which farm had more overstory trees with fairly open canopies?  Two coffee farms used different methods to grow coffee. Hill farm grown coffee conventionally, while Valley farm is into shade-grown coffee production.  Hint: With shade applications, crops are purposely raised under tree canopies within the shady environment. The understory crops are shade tolerant or the overstory trees have fairly open canopies. A conspicuous example is shade-grown coffee. This practice reduces weeding costs and improves coffee quality and taste. The shade does not necessarily translate into lost or reduced yields. This is because the rate of photosynthesis hardly increases once the light intensity is over about one tenth that of direct overhead sunlight and declines with increasing light intensity. This means that shaded plants can grow well. Planting more than one level of vegetation can increase total photosynthesis and overall yields.","output":"Valley farm had more overstory trees with fairly open canopies, as it is the farm that practices shade-grown coffee production."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: The reported margin of error is typically about twice the standard deviation ­– the radius of a 95 percent confidence interval . Question: what is standard deviation in statistics A:","output":"No, the provided answer does not directly define standard deviation in statistics. Let me give you a detailed answer to the question: Standard deviation is a measure of dispersion or variability in a dataset. In statistics, it is used to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean (average) of the dataset, while a high standard deviation shows that the values are spread out over a larger range. It is especially helpful when comparing the variability within two or more datasets. The standard deviation can be calculated as follows: 1. Find the mean (average) of the dataset. 2. Subtract the mean from each data point and square the result (this gives you the squared deviations). 3. Calculate the average of these squared deviations. 4. Take the square root of the result obtained in step 3. Mathematically, the standard deviation (σ), for a dataset with n values (x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ) and mean (μ), can be computed using this formula: σ = √[(Σ(xᵢ - μ)²)/n] In summary, standard deviation is a measure that helps evaluate the variability or spread of a dataset in statistics.

The story follows the lives of two strangers, John (played by the phenomenal Tom Williams) and Sarah (an incredible performance by Emma Clarke), who cross paths one fateful day and form an unlikely bond. The narrative is beautifully woven, unfolding with a gentle pace that allows the audience to immerse themselves into the characters' lives. Each scene is filled with raw emotion and vulnerability, every frame a masterpiece of cinematography. Tom Williams and Emma Clarke deliver powerhouse performances, deftly exploring the intricacies of their characters while maintaining a natural chemistry on-screen. Their deeply moving portrayals leave a lasting impression, tugging on the heartstrings of audiences long after the credits have rolled. The supporting cast also shines, with each member adeptly breathing life into their respective roles. Cinematographer James Bentley's work on this film is nothing short of spectacular. From sweeping panoramas to intimate, close-up shots, the visual narrative is as much a part of the story as the characters themselves. Bentley masterfully portrays the subtle interplay between light and shadow, meticulously crafting each shot for maximum impact. The result is a visual feast that enchants the viewer and enhances the emotional impact of the film. The musical score by Oscar-winning composer David Lang is an auditory delight. The original soundtrack is the perfect accompaniment to the film's narrative, evoking moments of profound joy, sorrow, hope, and reflection. Lang's masterful use of melodies and motifs truly elevates Radiant Horizons to new heights. In conclusion, Radiant Horizons stands as a shining example of the power of cinema to bring people together and touch hearts.

Write a \\"(1).\\" movie review (OPTIONS: (1). negative (2). positive).","output":"(1). Negative Movie Review: \\"Chaos Unleashed\\"  Chaos Unleashed, directed by renowned director James Belton, promised to be an adrenaline-pumping, intense cinematic experience filled with nail-biting action, charismatic characters, and an engaging storyline. Unfortunately, it turns out to be an exhausting hodgepodge of poorly executed elements that not only makes you regret the two hours and forty minutes you spent watching it but also leaves you questioning its very existence in the first place. The film starts with a promising premise: A team of professional thieves led by the suave yet enigmatic protagonist, Jack Strider played by Vincent Vane, is brought together for a high-stakes heist. But the moment the plan is set into motion, the movie turns into a puzzling series of badly choreographed action sequences and poorly-written dialogues that leave you questioning the director's intentions and the writers' sense of logic. As the plot unfolds, one cannot help but notice the glaring plot holes and inconsistencies that riddle the storyline. The twists and turns, which are meant to keep the audience on the edge of their seats, become increasingly convoluted and unconvincing as the film progresses. To add insult to injury, the climax falls flat with nothing more than a tasteless fusion of overused tropes that are most likely to trigger a barrage of facepalms. The acting in Chaos Unleashed is just as terrible as its story. The usually talented Vincent Vane delivers an agonizingly forced and unconvincing performance that makes no attempt to bring depth or complexity to the character of Jack Strider. The supporting characters, played by a star-studded cast, struggle to shine amid an array of dull and predictable dialogues. As a result, most of the performances are reduced to caricaturish versions of established action heroes. Even the action scenes, which should have been the film's saving grace, turn out to be disappointing. Instead of innovative, intensely choreographed sequences, the viewer is treated to an endless display of shoddy green screen work, poor CGI, and a blatant misuse of practical effects. The much-anticipated chase sequence comes across as a lackluster pursuit with stunt work that does little to invoke a sense of excitement or thrill. Moreover, Chaos Unleashed suffers immensely on the technical front as well. The film's pacing is erratic, switching between unbearably slow and jarringly rapid, making it difficult to maintain any semblance of investment in the story. The editing is choppy, with abrupt cuts that often obscure the flow of action. The score, composed by the highly regarded Alan Louis, is one of the primary letdowns of the film. It feels as if ripped straight out of a low-budget video game, and fails to elevate the intensity of any given scene. In conclusion, Chaos Unleashed is a colossally underwhelming movie that, despite its promising premise and talented cast, crashes and burns under the weight of its poor execution and lack of creativity. While diehard fans of the genre may still find some fleeting moments of enjoyment, the majority of viewers will most likely exit the theater feeling drained, confused and utterly disappointed by this squandered opportunity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Big cities are rarely home to thriving farmlands, but a group of Dutch architects hope to change that with the \\"Park Supermarket\\" -- an urban farming project that will attempt to grow and sell all the food of a modern supermarket in one place. The firm behind the proposal, Rotterdam-based Van Bergen Kolpa Architects, intends to produce everything from risotto rice, to kiwis to Tilapia fish all on one 4,000-acre plot of disused land in Randstad, Holland's largest metropolitan area. In defiance of the country's moderate climate, the architects say they have devised a system to control the park's outdoor environment, using old and new farming technologies to simulate Mediterranean and tropical climates in an ecologically sustainable way. The land, which had been earmarked for a large block of business developments before the global recession, cuts across the city fringes of Rotterdam and The Hague, serving a potential customer-base of over one million people, according to Van Bergen Kolpa Architects. \\"The cities surrounding the proposed site are home to 170 different eating cultures -- from Moroccan to Indonesian, from Turkish to Chinese -- and we're aiming to grow food to satisfy all their tastes,\\" said Jago van Bergen, an award-winning architect and one of the brains behind the \\"Park Supermarket\\" -- which has been shortlisted for the upcoming World Architecture Awards in November. \\"The plan is to divide the park into three climate zones -- moderate, Mediterranean and tropical. Because this will also be a recreational space, our goal is to make it as open as possible, without using greenhouses,\\" he said. But how exactly do you create a warm outdoor microclimate on the urban fringes of a north European city? According to van Bergen, it's not as far-fetched or futuristic as it sounds. \\"The main differences between a Mediterranean and moderate climate are longer periods of light and warmth in the evening, \\" he explained. \\"To make up this difference we'll use a combination of traditional and modern farming methods that all work by trapping and storing heat and releasing it when temperatures drop,\\" So, in an effort to grow typically Mediterranean foods like olives and peppers, for instance, van Bergen says he'll need little more than rows of \\"snake walls\\" and \\"climate pylons.\\" According to van Bergen, \\"snake walls\\", made from clay, curve over crops helping to shield them from cold winds, while simultaneously emitting heat absorbed during the day. \\"They used this method in the 18th century gardens of eastern Germany's Potsdam, so the king could grow grapes to make wine that tasted as good as the French stuff,\\" he said. \\"Climate pylons\\" are a more modern method of trapping heat. Van Bergen says they simply rain down a fine mist of water from high up, creating clouds that act like vapor roofs, stopping warm air from disappearing into the sky. However, for tropical foods like mangoes and basmati rice, van Bergen says the park will need another layer of warmth. \\"In this case, we'll pump geothermal energy -- heat stored deep in the lower soils -- up to the top using underground pipes filled with water,\\" he explained. \\"This technology is used in football stadiums to stop the pitches freezing over and more recently it's being used to heat homes.\\" Van Bergen concedes that the pumps and electric-powered lights that artificially extend daylight hours will require an additional input of energy, but claims that it will all be met by local renewable sources. Read related: 'Living' buildings could inhale city carbon emissions. The Park Supermarket was commissioned by planning officials from the South Holland Province, and plans are afoot for a small test site to be up and running by the end of this year. If successful, the firm believes this type of system could form part of a new approach to sustainable farming, making use of urban greenbelts while helping to reduce the carbon footprint associated with food production -- which accounts for up to 30% of total emissions worldwide, according to a 2008 Greenpeace report. \\"The dominant food-production system is based on fossil fuel at every level,\\" said Dr Martin Caraher, professor of food and health policy at London's City University. \\"It needs oil to make the fertilizer, oil for the farm, oil for the food processing, oil for the packaging and oil to transport it to the shops,\\" he added. Van Bergen says the park will reduce carbon emissions by cutting down on food processing and transport costs, while stimulating local industry and social bonds. \\"Because all the food in our supermarket will be grown on site we won't need a big processing factory to make packaging and we won't have to burn lots of fossil fuel to transport it across the globe,\\" he said. However, the Park Supermarket concept does not appeal to everyone. \\"Anything that reduces food miles and other carbon emissions linked to food production is normally a positive thing,\\" said Dr Nicola Canon, lecturer in crop sciences at the UK's Royal Agricultural College. \\"However, I have reservations about any system that creates open artificial climates. \\"We know that we are suffering from climate change, with one area enduring long wet spells while another goes through a prolonged drought. I wonder if we really ought to be exploring technologies that seek to control our already unpredictable weather cycles.\\" Canon is also concerned that the introduction of alien climates may also precipitate the introduction of alien pests. \\"Every time you raise humidity, you raise disease affectability -- because where you have good conditions for growth you also have good conditions for disease to grow. I think creating tropical climates next to moderate ones could introduce a host of new diseases and pests to the region in quite an unpredictable way,\\" she warned. Finally, while Canon says she appreciates what van Bergen and his team are trying to do, she doubts that the system could be replicated on a wider scale. \\"In my experience, it takes a lot of resources to create a relatively small microclimate. This means land that could otherwise be used for growing native crops is taken up with technology -- whether it be rows and rows of snake walls or climate pylons or whatever,\\" she said. For van Bergen, this type of criticism misses the point, because he sees the Park Supermarket as just one of many possible alternatives to the existing system of food production. \\"I'm not a preacher of any one form of agriculture,\\" he said. \\"Just like our energy, I think our future food supplies will have to come from a variety of sources, using a variety of methods -- of which we are sure this will be one. \\"But this is about more than sustainable, non-intensive farming, it's about cultivating community ties and giving new meaning to a space on the edge of the city that is currently being used for very little else.\\" Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"The Park Supermarket is an innovative urban farming project proposed by Van Bergen Kolpa Architects, based in the Netherlands. The Rotterdam-based firm aims to grow and sell a wide variety of food, including rice, kiwis, and fish, on a 4,000-acre plot of disused land in Holland's largest metropolitan area, Randstad. The architects will use both old and new farming technologies to create Mediterranean and tropical climate zones within the park in a sustainable manner. The park will be divided into three climate zones: moderate, Mediterranean, and tropical. This will allow for the cultivation of diverse foods that cater to the 170 different eating cultures present in the surrounding cities. The implementation of traditional and modern farming methods will help trap and store heat, which in turn will be released when temperatures drop. This technology will be used to create a warm outdoor microclimate, allowing the growth of crops typically found in Mediterranean and tropical climates. Some of the methods employed to achieve this include \\"snake walls\\", which shield crops from cold winds while emitting heat, and \\"climate pylons,\\" which release a fine mist of water that creates a vapor roof, effectively trapping warmth.

The Park Supermarket was commissioned by planning officials from the South Holland Province, and a small test site is expected to be operational by the end of the year.

Last week , I was in the kitchen while both kids were playing in the backyard . Based on the preceding passage, answer the following question Why would an injured player ultimately play in the game ?","output":"An injured player may ultimately decide to play in a game for various reasons, which can vary from personal motivations to external pressures. Some of the main reasons include: 1. Professional commitment: Playing hurt signifies a strong sense of duty and commitment to the team, coach, and fans. Athletes understand that their presence and performance on the field can significantly impact the outcome of a game. They may feel compelled to participate, even when dealing with physical pain or discomfort, to fulfill their professional obligations. 2. Financial considerations: Athletes, particularly those in professional sports, receive considerable salaries and bonuses. They might be more inclined to play through injuries to secure their income and maintain their value as an asset to the team. Additionally, performance incentives or clauses in contracts could motivate an injured player to participate in a game to achieve those financial benefits. 3. Fear of losing a position: In the competitive world of sports, athletes may worry that taking time off to recover from an injury might provide an opportunity for a teammate or competitor to take their spot on the team. Playing hurt could be a way to demonstrate dedication and maintain a secure position on the roster. 4. Team dynamics: Athletes often develop strong bonds with their teammates and have a deep sense of loyalty to their team. An injured player might choose to play in a game to support the team's success and not let their teammates down, especially in critical matches or moments in the season. 5. Passion for the game: Many athletes have a deep love for their sport and derive great satisfaction from participating in games. This passion can be a powerful motivator to play hurt, as the desire to be on the field or court outweighs the discomfort or pain associated with an injury. 6. Culture of toughness: Sports often foster a culture that values physical resilience and mental toughness. Athletes might feel pressure, either internally or externally, to display stoicism when dealing with injuries. Playing through pain can be seen as a testament to their character and dedication. 7. Optimal recovery strategies: In some cases, playing with minor injuries may not significantly exacerbate the issue. With appropriate medical guidance and treatment, it might be deemed safe for the player to continue participating in games while managing their injury. However, it is crucial for athletes, coaches, and support staff to carefully assess the risks and potential long-term consequences of playing hurt. In the best interest of the player's health and career longevity, the decision to participate in a game despite an injury should be guided by objective evaluations of the player's condition and the understanding that physical well-being should always be a priority."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Questions: What can happen when eating breakfast but not choosing the amount of food correctly? Options: - indigestion - heartburn - stomach ache - gain energy - overeating A:","output":"When eating breakfast but not choosing the amount of food correctly, various outcomes can occur as a result. It is essential to have a sense of the correct portion size for your own individual needs in order to maintain balance and overall health. While all the options provided may potentially happen, I will delve into each scenario in more detail to give a comprehensive understanding. 1. Indigestion: Overeating or eating too quickly during breakfast may cause indigestion. Indigestion occurs when your stomach has difficulty breaking down and processing the food, leading to symptoms such as bloating, gas, and nausea. Eating an excessive amount or eating too quickly can overwhelm your digestive system, causing discomfort and indigestion. To prevent this, eating mindfully and ensuring not to consume too much food at once can help. 2. Heartburn: Eating the wrong type of foods or consuming large portions can also trigger heartburn. Heartburn happens when stomach acid backs up into the esophagus, leading to a burning sensation in the chest. Choosing foods that are high in fat, acidic, or spicy can contribute to heartburn during breakfast. Reducing portion sizes and selecting healthier food options can help alleviate this issue. 3. Stomach ache: Eating too much or consuming foods that your body is sensitive or intolerant to can result in a stomach ache. Pain and abdominal discomfort may occur when the stomach struggles to digest the food properly or when it experiences too much pressure due to excessive food intake. Monitoring your portion sizes carefully and being mindful of food sensitivities can help prevent stomach aches during breakfast. 4. Gain energy: When you consume the right amount and type of food for breakfast, it can provide you with the energy you need to kick-start your day. A balanced breakfast consisting of proteins, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats will provide you with sustainable energy throughout the morning, improving mental clarity and overall performance. Choosing the correct amount of food plays a crucial role in reaping these energy-boosting benefits. 5. Overeating: When you fail to choose the appropriate amount of food for breakfast, you run the risk of overeating. Overeating frequently can lead to weight gain and put additional strain on your digestive system. It is crucial to identify your hunger cues and recognize when you have consumed enough food to prevent overeating. Implementing portion control strategies and eating slowly can assist in avoiding this issue. In summary, choosing the appropriate amount of food for breakfast is imperative to support optimal digestion, prevent discomfort, and provide the necessary energy for your day. Failing to select the correct portion size can lead to indigestion, heartburn, stomach ache, and overeating. However, when managed effectively and mindfully, breakfast can be an excellent source of energy and essential nutrients to start your day on a positive note."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A Nation's Vigil of Hope and Loss SENDAI, Japan—The Iwanuma City Fitness Center, the local gymnasium of a town that suffered the twin blows of Friday's earthquake and tsunami, has in recent days become a makeshift morgue. A four-month-old girl was rescued in Ishinomaki. Inside the nondescript white building on Monday were 53 bodies, nine of them still unidentified, that rescuers had pulled from mud and debris nearby. Outside, in the parking lot, small groups huddled in mourning. An elderly man walked out of the building, his legs appearing to buckle. Some here were distraught because they had found a loved one inside. Others were distraught because they hadn't. Morgue workers expected worse to come. \\"We think tomorrow will be the busy day,\\" a Red Cross official at the Iwanuma gym said Monday. \\"The military will be bringing in more bodies.\\" Facilities like this one, 20 miles south of the big city of Sendai, have cropped up all along Japan's devastated northeastern coastline to receive bodies found as floodwaters subside from Friday's tsunami. They form part of the new fabric of life in this zone—one of morgues, evacuation centers and vast, unreachable expanses of mud mixed with trees and fire extinguishers, tatami mats and minivans, doors and roofs. By early Tuesday, Japan's government said 2,400 people had died from Friday's 9.0-magnitude quake and the waves that followed. The toll is expected to rise as Japan increases the number of Self-Defense Force troops it is deploying to search and rescue operations—to 100,000, up from an initial deployment of 50,000—and continues to push into now-impassable areas. According to some news reports, some towns have been all but washed away. \\"There are isolated areas we still cannot reach,\\" a Self-Defense Force spokesman said Monday. He said survivors remain stranded in schools and other buildings in towns such as Onagawa, north of Sendai. \\"We are trying to rescue them with our helicopters. First, we need to find a place where the choppers can land.\\" Relief workers say they are growing less optimistic of finding survivors. \\"Yesterday they found someone alive,\\" said one policeman from Tokyo who arrived Saturday to help out. \\"Mostly, they just find bodies.\\" In a middle-school gymnasium in the nearby town of Arahama, now an evacuation center, four easel-size sheets of paper were filled with messages written by people seeking news of loved ones. \\"Erika Fujita was last seen near the Family-Mart in the second district of Arahama. If she is unharmed, please call her mother. She is worried,\\" one note read. Nearby, a power strip was filled with charging mobile phones, their owners waiting for good news. Throughout Monday, defense forces arrived at Iwanuma's makeshift morgue with bodies found in waters that had rushed far inland. Police examined and photographed corpses. Families streamed into the fitness center to file missing persons' reports and look at the police photos. Outside a side door, a van from a local funeral company made multiple trips, carrying those that had been identified. Life in the middle of Sendai appeared strangely routine Monday, apart from the cracked buildings and closed shops. Some women walked in high heels. One woman rode her bicycle with now-precious groceries in the front basket. Toward the Pacific coast, however, were police checkpoints, cranes and the blaring sirens of fire trucks and ambulances. Onlookers are generally kept at least two miles from the sea. Even at that distance, fields of mud and debris can be seen stretching for miles. Covered in inches of dark shiny sludge is a rich stew: a bicycle, an Ultraman stuffed toy, a fire extinguisher, a bank book. A soccer ball. A wheelchair. \\"You can't use any of it,\\" said Shigeru Matsumoto, a farmer with a rice paddy in this area. \\"It's been ruined by the water.\\" Speaking at the middle-school evacuation center in Arahama, the 61-year-old said he had been outside at around 2:30 p.m. Friday, getting his land ready for planting, when the quake hit. Though he said it was the biggest of the many tremors he has felt over his lifetime, he stayed in his field, some two miles inland. Then came the fire trucks, the helicopters, the orders to evacuate. \\"They were saying we had to flee, because a tsunami was coming,\\" he said. \\"I didn't think the water could possibly come in that far.\\" As he was trying to finish up his work, he says he heard a great noise—\\"Crack! Crack! Crack,\\" is how he describes it. He looked to see water and wood flying into the air in the distance. He jumped into his car. Tracing a diagram of his evacuation path on the dust of the floor, he described driving down a narrow road between the rice paddies. \\"One wrong turn and my wheel would get stuck, and it would be over,\\" he said. At a corner where the road turned left, away from the ocean, he said he could see the water rising. \\"It was there right in front of me,\\" he said. Mr. Matsumoto said he has returned to his home and found that the earthquake damaged it beyond repair. His land, he presumes, lies under muck. With many roads impassable to cars, he has salvaged a bicycle and has been helping a friend clean out his home in an area where residents have been permitted to return. \\"You would not believe what was washed in,\\" said Mr. Matsumoto, proudly gesturing to the muddy jumpsuit and rubber boots he had worn to clean the home. Mr. Matsumoto—who says he turned to farming after a life as a salaryman in a job he declined to name—says he wants to farm again. His resolve is tempered by thoughts of a friend's disappeared daughter and of the wall of water he just outran. Lowering his voice, he considers the thousands the government says are likely to have died. \\"I think it is tens of thousands,\\" he said.

This is a more efficient and thorough cleaning method. Option [A] suggests using a sponge and cleaning solution.

In the days following the first anniversary  of my dad 's death, I felt sad. I still missed him so much. I would walk over to his old house where my daughter now live and still expect to see him sitting out on his front porch . I would see him in my dreams, looking young and strong again. I felt bad too because I regretted not spending more time with him while he was here. I wished I had visited him more, talked with him more, and listened to him more. I wished I had asked the questions that I never did. I wished I had given him more hugs and told him I loved him more often. I wished I had cherished the time I had with him here. I was angry at the destiny  because Dad and Mum had both passed away before I was 50, and I was angry with myself because I hadn't made the most of time I had with them. Today, I found myself walking under a cloudy sky, staring at the leafless trees. As I walked along, one of the last golden maple leaves fell from its tree and sailed in the wind until it landed in front of me. I picked it up and smiled. At the moment of peace I felt a sound in my heart and mind: \\"death is momentary , but love is eternal .\\" I knew at that moment that my relationships with Mum and Dad were not over.

Possible answers: Decide to keep their shares in the market, Trade in their shares, support others to also sell their shares","output":"Based on the context presented, the 'Others' would likely want to 'Trade in their shares'. This is because the context suggests that the action Austin took - selling his shares - is perceived by 'Others' as a sensible move to prevent potential total loss. The phrase \\"if they did not do the same they would lose all their money forever\\" implies that the 'Others' are in a situation where not following Austin's example could lead to substantial financial loss.  Therefore, the most logical action for the 'Others' to take, to avoid the anticipated loss, would be to also 'Trade in their shares'. The other two options 'Decide to keep their shares in the market' and 'support others to also sell their shares' are less likely.

A: Answer:","output":"The common term for the chemical formula H2O is \\"water.\\" Water is a simple and ubiquitous compound that can be found all over the Earth in various forms, such as liquid, solid (ice), and gas (water vapor). It is composed of two hydrogen atoms (H) and one oxygen atom (O), hence the chemical representation of H2O. Water is essential for the existence and survival of all known forms of life. It serves as a medium for various biochemical reactions that take place in living organisms, including humans. It is also involved in temperature regulation, nutrient transport, waste elimination, and many other critical biological processes. The unique properties of water, such as its high heat capacity, high surface tension, and its ability to dissolve a wide variety of substances, have earned it the title of the \\"universal solvent.\\" This characteristic makes water indispensable in various natural and industrial processes. In Earth's hydrological cycle, water evaporates from the surface (mostly due to solar heat) and rises into the atmosphere, where it cools down and condenses into clouds. The water eventually returns to the Earth's surface in the form of precipitation (rain, snow, or other forms), replenishing the water sources like rivers, lakes, and oceans. Apart from its biological significance, water also plays a critical role in various social, economic, and industrial activities. It is used in agriculture for irrigation, in industries for manufacturing and cooling processes, and for domestic purposes like cooking, cleaning, and drinking. Furthermore, water has cultural and religious importance in many societies. Different religions have their unique ways of symbolizing water or using it in their rituals and ceremonies. In conclusion, the chemical formula H2O, commonly known as water, possesses distinctive chemical and physical properties that make it a vital component for life and various natural processes on Earth. It is not only essential for life's sustenance but also influences multiple aspects of human society, including agriculture, industry, and cultural practices."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

CHAPTER XXIV  Enid, my early and my only love, I thought, but that your father came between, In former days you saw me favourably, And if it were so, do not keep it back, Make me a little happier, let me know it.--TENNYSON  The foreign tour proved a great success. The summer in the Alps was delightful. The complete change gave Bertha new life, bodily strength first returning, and then mental activity. The glacier system was a happy exchange for her _ego_, and she observed and enjoyed with all the force of her acute intelligence and spirit of inquiry, while Phoebe was happy in doing her duty by profiting by all opportunities of observation, in taking care of Maria and listening to Mervyn, and Miss Charlecote enjoyed scenery, poetry, art, and natural objects with relish keener than even that of her young friends, who were less impressible to beauty in every shape.  Mervyn behaved very well to her, knowing himself bound to make the journey agreeable to her; he was constantly kind to Bertha, and in the pleasure of her revival submitted to a wonderful amount of history and science. All his grumbling was reserved for the private ear of Phoebe, whose privilege it always was to be his murmuring block, and who was only too thankful to keep to herself his discontents whenever his route was not chosen (and often when it was), his disgusts with inns, railroads, and sights and his impatience of all pursuits save Bertha's. Many a time she was permitted to see and hear nothing but how much he was bored, but on the whole the growls were so mitigated compared with what she had known, that it was almost contentment; and that he did not absolutely dislike their habits was plain from his adherence to the ladies, though he might have been quite independent of them.  1.

In one account, Tweedy recalled: Around this time, I would say something into a microphone onstage, and afterward [Farrar would] pull me aside and say, \\"Don't you ever fucking talk into that microphone again.\\" He would misconstrue me talking into the microphone as more evidence of my out-of-control, rampant ego, more evidence of me feeling like I didn't have to be so fucking afraid anymore. Tweedy felt the new members gave him a new opportunity to contribute to the band, but Farrar felt disdain for Tweedy's new carefree attitude. Years later, Farrar would claim that he had been tempted to quit the band after seeing Tweedy stroking the hair of Farrar's girlfriend, an act which he believed to have been a proposition. In January 1994, Farrar called manager Tony Margherita to inform him of his decision to leave the band. Farrar told Margherita that he was no longer having fun, and didn't want to work with Tweedy anymore. Soon after the breakup, Farrar explained his departure: \\"It just seemed like it reached a point where Jeff and I really weren't compatible. It had ceased to be a symbiotic songwriting relationship, probably after the first record.\\"Tweedy was enraged that he heard the news secondhand from Margherita, since Farrar decided not to tell him in person.

As a favor to Margherita—who had spent a substantial amount of money to keep the band running—Farrar agreed to a final tour with Uncle Tupelo in North America. Tweedy and Farrar again engaged in a shouting match two weeks into the tour, due to Farrar's refusal to sing harmony on any of Tweedy's songs.

Information:  - An electric guitar is a fretted string instrument that uses a pickup to convert the vibration of its stringswhich are typically made of steel, and which occurs when a guitarist strums, plucks or fingerpicks the stringsinto electrical signals. The vibrations of the strings are sensed by a pickup, of which the most common type is the magnetic pickup, which uses the principle of direct electromagnetic induction. The signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is plugged into a guitar amplifier before being sent to a loudspeaker, which makes a sound loud enough to hear. The output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, and the signal can easily be altered by electronic circuits to add \\"color\\" to the sound or change the sound. Often the signal is modified using effects such as reverb and distortion and \\"overdrive\\", with the latter being a key element of the sound of the electric guitar as it is used in blues and rock music.  - John Michael \\"Ozzy\\" Osbourne (born 3 December 1948) is an English singer, songwriter, and actor. He rose to prominence in the early 1970s as the lead vocalist of the heavy metal band Black Sabbath. He was fired from Black Sabbath in 1979 and went on to have a successful solo career, releasing 11 studio albums, the first seven of which were all awarded multi-platinum certifications in the US. Osbourne has since reunited with Black Sabbath on several occasions, recording the album \\"13\\" in 2013. His longevity and success have earned him the informal title of \\"Godfather of Heavy Metal\\".   - Ö, or ö, is a character that represents either a letter from several extended Latin alphabets, or the letter O modified with an umlaut mark or diaeresis. In many languages, the letter ö, or the O modified with what is known as an \\"umlaut mark\\", is used to denote the non-close front rounded vowels or . In languages without such vowels, the character is known as an \\"O with diaeresis\\" and denotes a syllable break, wherein its pronunciation remains an unmodified .  - Ian Fraser Kilmister (24 December 1945  28 December 2015), better known as Lemmy, was an English musician, singer, and songwriter who founded and fronted the rock band Motörhead. His music was one of the foundations of the heavy metal genre. He was known for his appearance (including his friendly mutton chops), his distinctive gravelly voice and distinctive bass playing style. Alongside his music career, he also had many minor roles in film and television.  - Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of rock music that began in the mid-1960s, with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with pianos and keyboards.  - Peter Frederick \\"Pete\\" Way (born 7 August 1951, Enfield, Middlesex) is an English bass player. He is the former, and best-known, bassist of UFO, Waysted and also Fastway and Ozzy Osbourne.  - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources.  - Waysted is a rock band formed by the UFO bass guitarist Pete Way and the Scottish rocker Fin Muir (Ian More) in 1982. Recruiting Frank Noon (formerly with Def Leppard), Ronnie Kayfield and Paul Raymond, Waysted signed to Chrysalis Records and released \\"Vices\\" in 1983.  - Motörhead were an English rock band formed in June 1975 by bassist, singer, and songwriter Ian Fraser \\"Lemmy\\" Kilmister, who was the sole constant member. The band is often considered a precursor to, or one of the earliest members of, the new wave of British heavy metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Though several guitarists and drummers played in Motörhead, most of their best-selling albums and singles feature the work of \\"Fast\\" Eddie Clarke on lead guitar and Phil \\"Philthy Animal\\" Taylor on drums.  - Mechanix is the tenth studio album by the British hard rock band UFO ; it was released in 1982 . The contemporary music - press adverts on the album 's release carried the tag - line ' Mechanix : it will tighten your nuts ' .

Journalist Geoff Barton coined the term in a May 1979 issue of the British music newspaper \\"Sounds\\" to describe the emergence of new heavy metal bands in the late 1970s, during the period of punk rock's decline and the dominance of new wave music.  - A bassist, or bass player, is a musician who plays a bass instrument such as a double bass, bass guitar, keyboard bass or a low brass instrument such as a tuba or sousaphone. Different musical genres tend to be associated with one or more of these instruments. Since the 1960s, the electric bass has been the standard bass instrument for funk, R&B, soul music, rock and roll, reggae, jazz fusion, heavy metal, country and pop music.

When he was arrested at his Chicago home in 2012 for hacking the website of security think tank Stratfor, the dreadlocked Jeremy Hammond was the FBI's most wanted cybercriminal. Authorities tracked him down with the help of top LulzSec member Hector Xavier Monsegur. But it has never been known how they managed to search his encrypted computer, the lid of which the hacker was able to close as agents armed with assault rifles were raiding his home.      An Associated Press profile of the 29-year-old's life behind bars provides a possible answer. Hammond's password was \\"Chewy 123.\\"      Hashing algorithms protecting encryption keys are by design extremely slow, making cracking attacks harder to carry out. The more guesses the attacker tries the exponentially longer it will take. As demonstrated in previous Ars articles such as Why passwords have never been weaker—and crackers have never been stronger and Anatomy of a hack: How crackers ransack passwords like “qeadzcwrsfxv1331”, \\"Chewy 123\\" would be among the earlier candidates any experienced cracker would try. And assuming agents performed any research on their then suspect, \\"Chewy 123\\" would almost certainly have been near the top of the list. \\"Chewy,\\" it turns out, was the name of Hammond's cat.      Brief updated in the first paragraph to clarify how Hammond encrypted his data. ||||| MANCHESTER, Ky. (AP) — Cocaine dealers, bank robbers and carjackers converge at Manchester Federal Prison in rural Kentucky — and then there is Jeremy Hammond, a tousle-haired and talented hacker whose nimble fingers have clicked and tapped their way into the nation's computing systems. Among those whose data he helped expose: the husband of the federal judge who sentenced him.      \\"From the start, I always wanted to target government websites, but also police and corporations that profit off government contracts,\\" he says. \\"I hacked lots of dot-govs.\\"      An Associated Press report this week found the 10 billion-a-year effort to protect the federal government's extensive computer systems is struggling to keep up with a daily bombardment of cyberattacks from thieves and hostile states that grab Social Security numbers, peruse Pentagon secrets and hijack critical websites. Human error, by way of employee missteps, is often to blame.      Those behind these incidents are a motley group: foreign spies, intellectual property thieves, personal identity peddlers, and, increasingly, politically motivated hacktivists like Hammond. Once the FBI's most-wanted cybercriminal, Hammond is serving one of the longest sentences a U.S. hacker has received — 10 years, the maximum allowed under his plea agreement last year.      \\"This is the nicest room in the place,\\" he said when the AP recently sat down with him in a drab cinderblock visiting room to talk about how and why he did what he did. Prison authorities barred cameras and recorders, citing security.      A hacktivist for more than a decade, Hammond, 29, was arrested in 2012 after penetrating the U.S.-based security think tank Stratfor, whose clients include the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Defense Department.      He'd been working with a subgroup of the loose-knit hacking movement \\"Anonymous\\" to disrupt the networks of Sony Pictures, the Public Broadcasting Service, the Arizona Department of Public Safety and others when a member of the group enlisted him to help break into Stratfor's systems.      Some breaches in Hammond's life had been a challenge. He'd search the code on websites he wanted to target, combing through the symbols and letters of computing languages for security flaws to exploit. He'd create user accounts on the sites, and then test for ways in. It could take months of trying, and sometimes he gave up.      But the Stratfor hack was a cinch, he said. Basic security was not in place, a flaw later acknowledged by Stratfor CEO George Friedman. \\"We did not encrypt credit card files,\\" Friedman said. \\"This was our failure.\\"      Hammond was like a kid in a candy shop: \\"I was like damn man, this is crazy.\\"      The hackers posted emails between Stratfor employees and clients on the WikiLeaks website (some 5 million exchanges, they claimed), along with credit card data from a client list that included Northrop Grumman, the Marine Corps and Time Warner Cable. They used some of the credit card numbers to donate money to the Red Cross, according to court records.      Among the thousands whose emails were disclosed was the husband of the federal judge who sentenced Hammond. She chose not to recuse herself, noting that no harm was done. Her husband's email address was exposed but already publicly available, and no actual correspondence or credit card information was revealed.      Federal prosecutors said the Stratfor hack resulted in more than a million dollars in losses to individuals, and threatened public safety. A hacking \\"recidivist,\\" they called Hammond.      Raised in the Chicago suburb of Glendale Heights with his twin brother Jason by their father, a musician, Hammond said he was a \\"nonconformist, anti-authority\\" kid. At 8, he tried his hand at designing video games. A few years later, he started hacking.      Then came 9/11. Hammond was 16, and considered some of the government's anti-terrorism actions \\"police state measures.\\"      \\"I had a sense of duty to take action,\\" he said.      With his brother, he protested, started an underground school newspaper and then organized a high school walkout when the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003. That year, Hammond also launched HackThisSite.org, where hackers of all skill levels can hone their abilities and share tips.      He considered hacking a means of social justice, and he did it in secret while pursuing civil disobedience and protest in public, as well.      He started the University of Illinois at Chicago with a full scholarship, cooked and gave food to homeless people and set up a free public computer lab.      He also hacked into the university's computer science department website, and then told administrators about the vulnerability. They kicked him out, according to court records.      That summer, at 19, with a black scarf tied around his neck, Hammond was both heckled and cheered as he encouraged the audience at the hacking conference DEFCON to engage in a campaign of \\"electronic civil disobedience\\" against the upcoming Republican National Convention in New York.      \\"There's going to be a series of defacements, financial disruption, email flood campaigns,\\" he promised, and some GOP websites did later report technical difficulties.      As Hammond's social and political actions mounted, so did his arrest record. He pleaded guilty to battery after fighting with anti-gay protesters at a Chicago Pride Parade and was again taken to jail after joining hundreds of counter-demonstrators at a neo-Nazi rally.      A hack into the website of a group that was harassing Iraq War opponents got Hammond sentenced, in 2008, to 20 months in federal prison. Once out, he got involved in local activist movements, then public protests and then more hacking.      Working from a coffee shop or inside a vacant building with Wi-Fi nearby, Hammond used a Tor web browser that prevents people from learning the user's location, and he identified himself only with nicknames including \\"Anarchaos\\" and \\"crediblethreat.\\"      He always had a day job — at a computer repair store and, later, as a web developer for an advertising firm. Hammond's brother, who lived with him, told the sentencing judge that \\"no one around him had any inkling that he was getting involved in the group called Anonymous.\\"      Three months after the Stratfor leak, on March 5, 2012, Hammond was smoking pot and chatting with friends in the kitchen of his Chicago home when the front door was kicked in. Someone threw a flash bang.      \\"There were all these dudes with assault rifles,\\" he said.      Everyone else hit the floor, but Hammond dashed to his bedroom to slam shut his encrypted Mac laptop.      The FBI caught Hammond with the assistance of Hector Xavier Monsegur, a famous hacker known as Sabu who helped law enforcement infiltrate Anonymous and convict eight hackers in all.      Hammond, up for release in 2020, spends his days folding laundry and sewing, studying Spanish, playing chess and reading books supporters send him.      Asked about the larger danger posed by cybercriminals, he laughed at the idea that some consider such attacks as threatening to national security as terrorism.      \\"I mean, I didn't kill anybody,\\" he said.      At the same time, he knows the risk of nation states or others using a computer to do harm is real.      \\"If I was capable of doing these things on my own or with my team, what about a well-financed team that trained for years?\\"      To this day, Hammond is unsure how agents cracked his encryption program and got what they needed to land him back in prison. But he has one idea: \\"My password was really weak.\\"      It was his cat.      \\"Chewy,\\" he said, looking down at his hands. \\"Chewy 123.\\"      ___      Follow Martha Mendoza at https://twitter.com/mendozamartha ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Hacker Jeremy Hammond, who was once the FBI's most-wanted cybercriminal, has explained how his former hacking collective LulzSec compromised the security of US-based think tank Stratfor in 2012.

Which person inherited a parcel with fewer grass root systems in its soil?  Hint: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.

Sad stories do exist in large numbers for the past lottery winners and that's why some financial experts say \\"70 percent of lottery winners will squander away   winning within a few years.\\" Some end up losing all within two years, family relationships destroyed or even worse. Wayne Schenk was an old soldier diagnosed with lung cancer. When he won a million dollars in a lottery he thought his troubles were over and he would get the advanced medical treatment that might save his life. But Lottery officials refused to pay him the total sum in a single payment and they said they could not make an exception to the regulations. When Schenk died in 2007, he'd only received one payment of 34,000. Another lottery winner, Billy Bob Harrell, Jr. killed himself two years after winning 31 million dollars in the Texas lottery in 1997.He'd spent large amounts of money and given large amounts away, but he didn't end me expected peace that should have come with the freedom of money.

The two bridges were constructed before the lake was filled, and replaced wooden structures. Site testing for both the Commonwealth Avenue and Kings Avenue bridges took place during late 1959 to early 1960. The construction of the Kings Avenue Bridge began in 1960, followed by Commonwealth Avenue Bridge the year after. Fortunately for the builders, Canberra was in a drought and the ground remained dry during construction. Both bridges use post-tensioned concrete, reinforced with rustproof steel cables.Both bridges are made of concrete and steel and are dual-carriageway; Commonwealth Avenue has three lanes in each direction while Kings Avenue has two. Instead of traditional lamp post lighting, Kings Avenue Bridge was illuminated by a series of fluorescent tubes on the handrails, a concept known as \\"integral lighting\\".

Meyers calls his boss, senior campaign manager Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who doesn't answer. Meyers decides to meet Duffy, who offers Meyers a position in Pullman's campaign, an offer Meyers refuses. Zara calls Meyers back and asks what was important, but Meyers says it was nothing to worry about. Meanwhile, Meyers starts a sexual relationship with Molly Stearns (Evan Rachel Wood), an attractive intern for Morris's campaign and daughter of Jack Stearns, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Meyers admits to an angry Zara that he met with Duffy, and that Duffy said his candidate will offer Thompson the position of Secretary of State, guaranteeing Pullman's victory. Zara and Meyers discuss the matter with Morris, saying they must make the same offer to Thompson to secure his endorsement and his delegates' votes. Morris refuses on principle, as he thoroughly disagrees with Thompson and his policies, and wants a \\"clean\\" campaign without such deals. Late one night when Molly is sleeping, Meyers discovers that Morris is trying to call her after he picks up her phone by mistake. Meyers finds out that Molly and Morris had a brief sexual liaison at a campaign stop in Iowa several weeks previously, and Molly is now pregnant by the Governor, which will cause a scandal. Molly needs 900 for an abortion, but cannot tell her father because their family are Catholics. Meyers helps her with money but warns her not to tell anybody.

Define the keywords in the hypothesis: \\"Apaches are not dumb.\\" 3. Compare the meanings of the keywords and see if they suggest the same idea. 4. Reach a conclusion based on the comparison. Step 1: The premise states that \\"Apaches are not stupid.\\" This implies that Apaches have intelligence and should not be considered as lacking intelligence. Step 2: The hypothesis consists of two keywords - \\"Apaches\\" and \\"not dumb.\\" \\"Apaches\\" refers to the same group of people in both the premise and the hypothesis. \\"Not dumb\\" implies that Apaches are not lacking intelligence. Step 3: Comparing the key expressions in the premise and hypothesis - \\"not stupid\\" and \\"not dumb\\" - Both terms have a similar meaning, indicating a lack of intelligence. By stating \\"not\\" before both expressions, the premise and hypothesis suggest that Apaches have intelligence. Step 4: Based on the comparison in Step 3, since the premise states that Apaches are not stupid, and the hypothesis is about Apaches not being dumb, the meanings of \\"not stupid\\" and \\"not dumb\\" are similar.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Morello and Cornell initially disagreed over the particulars of Cornell quitting the group, with Morello claiming that Cornell did not communicate directly with him about leaving, while Cornell countered: \\"Tom and I did have communications about the fact that I was gonna go make a record, and that I was tired of what ended up seeming like political negotiations toward how we were gonna do Audioslave business and getting nowhere with it.\\" He also added that this process of \\"doing Audioslave business\\" led him to go solo. Cornell has said that the breakup was not about money, but that he was just not getting along with the other members during their later years. Said Cornell, \\"Getting along as people is one thing.

Movie plot title: 9Â½ Weeks Movie plot: The title of the film refers to the duration of a relationship between Wall Street arbitrageur John Gray and divorced SoHo art gallery employee Elizabeth McGraw. John initiates and controls the various experimental sexual practices of this volatile relationship to push Elizabeth's boundaries. In doing so, Elizabeth experiences a gradual downward spiral toward emotional breakdown. Elizabeth first sees John in New York City where she grocery shops and again at a street market where she decides against buying an expensive scarf. John wins her heart when he eventually produces that scarf. They start dating, and Elizabeth is increasingly subjected to John's behavioral peculiarities; he blindfolds Elizabeth, who is at first reluctant to comply with his sexual fantasy demands. Yet she sees him as loving and playful. He gives her an expensive gold watch, and instructs her to use it to think about him at noon. She takes this imperative even further by masturbating at her workplace at the designated time. However, he ultimately confuses Elizabeth by his reluctance to meet her friends despite the intimacy of their sexual relations. Elizabeth's confusion about John increases when he leaves her alone at his apartment. She examines his closet until she discovers a photograph of him with another woman. John asks her if she went through his stuff, declaring that he will punish her. Their ensuing altercation escalates into sexual assault until she blissfully concedes to his struggle to overpower her.

Q: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output. run around left thrice after jump left twice A:","output":"To find the sequence of actions for the given command \\"run around left thrice after jump left twice\\", we can break it down using the given rules: 1. Identify the main parts of the command: \\"jump left twice\\" and \\"run around left thrice\\". 2. For the first part \\"jump left twice\\", we execute 'I_JUMP' and 'I_TURN_LEFT', then repeat it another time. So, the actions are: I_JUMP, I_TURN_LEFT, I_JUMP, I_TURN_LEFT. 3. For the second part \\"run around left thrice\\", we need to first execute 'I_RUN', then turn around left (i.e., execute 'I_TURN_LEFT' twice) and then repeat the process two more times. So, the actions are: I_RUN, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_RUN, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_RUN, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT. 4. According to the word 'after', we need to execute the actions of the first part, followed by the actions of the second part.

Would \\"Other naked-eye comets may be brighter and more spectacular, but will appear only once in thousands of years.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"Halley's Comet is next expected to be visible from Earth in 2061. It is a short-period comet, which means it has a relatively short orbital period around the Sun. In the case of Halley's Comet, this period is approximately 75-76 years. Its last appearance was in 1986. Regarding the statement \\"Other naked-eye comets may be brighter and more spectacular, but will appear only once in thousands of years,\\" it is only partially accurate. While it is true that other comets can be brighter and more spectacular, their visibility and frequency can vary greatly. Some comets may indeed appear only once in thousands of years, such as long-period comets, which have orbital periods longer than 200 years. However, others are short-period comets, with orbital periods shorter than 200 years, making them more frequent visitors to Earth's vicinity. In summary, Halley's Comet will next appear in 2061, and although other naked-eye comets may be more visually impressive, their frequency and visibility can vary significantly.

Krug requests for them to stop so that he can piss, but they refuse. The car stops at a railroad crossing while a train passes through. Suddenly, a truck crashes into the car. Two masked people get out of the truck and walk over to the car. These people turn out to be Krug's younger brother Francis (Aaron Paul) and Krug's girlfriend Sadie (Riki Lindhome). Giles, extremely bloodied, is still alive and so Sadie shoots him in the head. She then frees Krug and kisses him. Krug asks Francis about his son, and he says that he's okay. Morton is also still alive, though badly injured. Krug strangles him with his seatbelt and they all wonder what Morton's thinking about as he's dying.

Throughout the film, they inflict pain and suffering on others, including kidnapping, sexually assaulting, and attempting to kill 16-year-old Mari Collingwood (Sara Paxton).

The mighty fane, with its three massive towers, rises majestically over the red roofs of the town. Its most striking feature is the great Norman screen, running up without buttresses or projections to the parapet and hiding the bases of the square, richly decorated towers of the west front. The plain centre of the screen is the work of Remigius, the first bishop. The rest of it is relieved with rich arcading of Late Norman and Early English periods. The wooden spires which crowned the towers were removed in 1807. In 1192 Hugh of Avalon determined to rebuild the Norman building of Remigius, which an earthquake had shaken. To him we owe the choir and eastern transept. His successors completed the western transept and began the west end of the nave. So much money had to be spent in rebuilding the central tower, which fell in 1239, that the canons could not rebuild the nave entirely, but had to incorporate the Norman end by Remigius. Unfortunately the axis of the west front does not correspond to that of the nave, which is too wide for its height. The low vaulting is a serious defect in the choir built by St. Hugh, but of the superb beauty of the Angel Choir, which encloses his shrine, there can be no doubt. In its richness of sculpture it is one of the masterpieces of Gothic architecture in England. The interior of the cathedral is remarkable for the harmony of its style, which is Lancet-Gothic, and the dim lighting of the nave only adds to its impressiveness.

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) seeks to encourage the identification, protection and preservation of cultural and natural heritage around the world considered to be of outstanding value to humanity. This is _ in an international treaty called the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, adopted by UNESCO in 1972. UNESCO's World Heritage mission is to: encourage countries to sign the World Heritage Convention and to ensure the protection of their natural and cultural heritage;  encourage States Parties to the Convention to nominate  sites within their national territory for inclusion on the World Heritage List;  encourage States Parties to establish management plans and set up reporting systems on the state of conservation of their World Heritage sites; help States Parties safeguard World Heritage properties by providing technical assistance and professional training; provide emergency assistance for World Heritage sites in immediate danger; support States Parties' public awareness-building activities for World Heritage conservation; encourage participation of the local population in the preservation of their cultural and natural heritage; encourage international cooperation in the conservation of our world's cultural and natural heritage.

Increasing physical activity: Engaging in regular exercise, such as walking, swimming, or participating in sports, can help burn calories and promote weight loss. 2. Prioritizing sleep: Poor sleep quality can lead to weight gain, so focusing on getting enough restful sleep can contribute to weight loss efforts. 3. Adopting healthier habits: Small changes, like opting for the stairs instead of an elevator or parking further away from a destination, can help improve overall fitness levels. 4. Portion control: Being mindful of portion sizes can make a significant difference in calorie consumption, even if the types of foods consumed don't change dramatically. 5. Drinking more water: Adequate hydration can help with weight loss by improving digestion and maintaining appropriate hunger signals. The second question \\"How do I lose weight through diet only?\\" is specifically requesting advice on how to achieve weight loss solely through adjusting one's diet and food choices. This question suggests that the individual prefers not to rely on exercise or other factors, but to solely focus on their food consumption. To lose weight through diet only, the following changes can be made: 1. Reducing caloric intake: Consuming fewer calories than one's body needs will result in weight loss, as the body will need to use stored fat for energy. 2. Prioritizing nutrient-dense foods: Focusing on whole foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains can help maintain overall health while also promoting weight loss. 3. Eliminating processed foods and added sugars: Consuming large amounts of unhealthy, processed foods can lead to weight gain, so cutting them out of your diet can be beneficial. 4. Balancing macronutrient proportions: Adjusting one's diet to include optimal amounts of protein, fat, and carbohydrates can help support weight loss efforts. 5. Practicing mindful eating: Slowing down and consuming food mindfully can help control overeating and lead to weight loss over time. In summary, the questions have different focuses; the first question is about weight loss without necessarily changing the diet, while the second question seeks advice on weight loss through diet adjustments alone."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this \\"I watched mothers, fathers, other relatives and friends break down in tears at Chiromo mortuary in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, as coffins of their young sons and daughters were handed over.\\" Article:","output":"Title: The Hearts of Kenya - Grieving for a Generation at Chiromo Mortuary The weight of loss and pain lay heavily on the stooped shoulders of Kenyan families as they moved between the dusty corridors of the Chiromo Mortuary in Nairobi. With trembling hands, they prepared to embrace the wooden coffins of sons and daughters, torn away from them too soon, leaving wounds that will never heal. Friends and strangers alike bore witness to these tragedies, stunned in disbelief as tears rolled down their cheeks, blurring the already grey world of grief. In the past several months, a rising wave of violence has led to an alarming surge in the number of young lives lost in Kenya. Despite various efforts by the government and the local populace to restore the sense of security that once prevailed, the disease of lawlessness continues to spread, leaving devastation in its wake. The unsettling silence of a disrupted normalcy echoes through the empty lanes and deserted playgrounds of the country, a haunting reminder of those who were robbed of laughter, of hope, of a future. The Chiromo Mortuary, Kenya’s largest morgue, is the final stop for many of these young victims, where mothers, fathers, relatives, and friends gather to come face-to-face with the catastrophic aftermath. Many of these families arrive carrying the burden of unspoken questions and the longing to see their loved ones for the last time. Often, understanding dawned slowly, as if the mind was reluctant to accept the inevitable truth. The morgue is a microcosm that contains the complete spectrum of human emotions - immeasurable sorrow, intense anger, and frustration with the state of affairs. Among these shadows, however, flickers of love and warmth still persist. Relatives and strangers alike merge together, intertwining fingers, holding one another upright, and illuminating the darkness by lending their shoulders and sharing their tears. While the stark reality of the dark corners of the mortuary reminds these grieving individuals of the brevity of life and the painful certainty of separation, it is the collective support and unity displayed within these walls that demonstrate the strength and resilience of the Kenyan spirit. A shared struggle transcends diverse backgrounds and personal histories, as mankind unites in a common surge of empathy and solidarity. It is within these simple acts of human kindness that hope prevails and resilience finds its roots. The grief that stems from the loss of young lives in Kenya blurs the boundaries of class, race, and ethnicity, reminding us all that the tendrils of tragedy reach without discrimination. The compelling stories of each life lost continue to resonate deeply within hearts and minds both within and beyond Kenya, urging us to call for change and to protect future generations from similar fates. As the weight of the coffins grows heavier and the veil of sorrow thickens at the Chiromo Mortuary, a collective cry for justice rises from trembling lips and tear-filled eyes. The dreams that once danced within the hearts of young Kenyans have been snuffed out in the blink of an eye, and it is in the depths of this sorrow that families, friends, and strangers find a common purpose - to ensure that no more generations of Kenyans are lost to the darkness of violence, and to continue the legacy of love and hope that their departed loved ones once embodied. In the midst of these seemingly endless heartaches, we must strive to remember the warmth and vitality of the young souls that once graced Kenya. For, in the words of Kenyan Nobel laureate Wangari Maathai, \\"In the course of history, there comes a time when humanity is called to shift to a new level of consciousness, to reach a higher moral ground.\\" As the cycle of violence persists, let us ensure that the sacrifices of the sons and daughters of Kenya are not in vain and instead serve as a powerful wakeup call for healing, strength, and change."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

They look at the menus trying to decide what to order when a waiter shows up and asks if they would like anything to drink. Steve says he would like a glass of water that has molecules far apart. Chris orders water with molecules closer together. The waiter looks at them with a rather confused look and asks them to please elaborate.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Who ordered warmer water?  Hint: Liquid water is a fluid. The hydrogen bonds in liquid water constantly break and reform as the water molecules tumble past one another. As water cools, its molecular motion slows and the molecules move gradually closer to one another. The density of any liquid increases as its temperature decreases. For most liquids, this continues as the liquid freezes and the solid state is denser than the liquid state. However, water behaves differently. It actually reaches its highest density at about 4°C. A:","output":"Given the information provided in the paragraph and the hint, we can determine that warmer water has molecules that are farther apart, whereas cooler water's molecules are closer together. In this situation, Steve ordered warmer water, since he requested a glass of water with molecules far apart.

Given the background: Biodiversity loss is the extinction of species (plant or animal) worldwide, and also the local reduction or loss of species in a certain habitat.  The latter phenomenon can be temporary or permanent, depending on whether the environmental degradation that leads to the loss is reversible through ecological restoration / ecological resilience or effectively permanent (e.g. through land loss). Global extinction has so far been proven to be irreversible.  Even though permanent global species loss is a more dramatic phenomenon than regional changes in species composition, even minor changes from a healthy stable state can have dramatic influence on the food web and the food chain insofar as reductions in only one species can adversely affect the entire chain (coextinction), leading to an overall reduction in biodiversity, possible alternative stable states of an ecosystem notwithstanding. Ecological effects of biodiversity are usually counteracted by its loss. Reduced biodiversity in particular leads to reduced ecosystem services and eventually poses an immediate danger for food security, also for humankind.[1]  and the situation: Two neighboring lands experienced different climates. In Iceland, the actions of its people lead to a loss of animal and plant species. Denmark tried to keep the environment untouched as they understood its importance and the climate was unaffected.  Answer the following question: Which country had a more dramatic influence on the food web? The answer to this question is:","output":"Iceland had a more dramatic influence on the food web. This is because the actions of its people led to a loss of animal and plant species, which in turn directly impacted the local biodiversity. Biodiversity loss can greatly affect the food web and food chain, as reductions in only one species can have significant consequences for the entire chain (coextinction), leading to an overall reduction in biodiversity and ecosystem services. In contrast, Denmark tried to maintain the environment relatively untouched and keep its climate unaffected.

Given the question: Information:  - Romantic nationalism (also national romanticism, organic nationalism, identity nationalism) is the form of nationalism in which the state derives its political legitimacy as an organic consequence of the unity of those it governs. This includes, depending on the particular manner of practice, the language, race, culture, religion, and customs of the \\"nation\\" in its primal sense of those who were \\"born\\" within its culture. This form of nationalism arose in reaction to dynastic or imperial hegemony, which assessed the legitimacy of the state from the \\"top down\\", emanating from a monarch or other authority, which justified its existence. Such downward-radiating power might ultimately derive from a god or gods (see the divine right of kings and the Mandate of Heaven).  - Josef Daniel Stenbäck (May 2, 1854, Alavus  April 27, 1929, Helsinki) was a Finnish church architect and engineer. He designed 35 churches for Finland, which until 1917 was part of the Russian Empire. Four of the churches were located in the current Russian territory of the Karelian Isthmus, ceded to the Soviet Union in 1944. Stenbäck's churches represent Romantic nationalism or Gothic Revival. One of his most famous works is the Juselius Mausoleum.  - Joensuu Church is located in the centre of Joensuu , North Karelia , Finland .

Summarize this article: For other shrines dedicated to Artemis, see Temple of Artemis (disambiguation)      Coordinates:      This model of the Temple of Artemis, at Miniatürk Park, Istanbul, Turkey, attempts to recreate the probable appearance of the first temple.      The Temple of Artemis or Artemision (Greek: Ἀρτεμίσιον; Turkish: Artemis Tapınağı), also known less precisely as the Temple of Diana, was a Greek temple dedicated to an ancient, local form of the goddess Artemis. It was located in Ephesus (near the modern town of Selçuk in present-day Turkey). It was completely rebuilt three times, and in its final form was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. By 401 AD it had been ruined or destroyed.[1] Only foundations and fragments of the last temple remain at the site.      The earliest version of the temple (a temenos) antedated the Ionic immigration by many years, and dates to the Bronze Age. Callimachus, in his Hymn to Artemis, attributed it to the Amazons. In the 7th century BC, it was destroyed by a flood. Its reconstruction, in more grandiose form, began around 550 BC, under the Cretan architect Chersiphron and his son Metagenes. The project was funded by Croesus of Lydia, and took 10 years to complete. This version of the temple was destroyed in 356 BC by Herostratus in an act of arson. The next, greatest and last form of the temple, funded by the Ephesians themselves, is described in Antipater of Sidon's list of the world's Seven Wonders:      Location and history [ edit ]      The fame of the Temple of Artemis was known in the Renaissance , as demonstrated in this imagined portrayal of the temple in a 16th-century hand-colored engraving by Martin Heemskerck      The Temple of Artemis was located near the ancient city of Ephesus, about 75 km south from the modern port city of İzmir, in Turkey. Today the site lies on the edge of the modern town of Selçuk.      The sacred site (temenos) at Ephesus was far older than the Artemision itself. Pausanias was certain that it antedated the Ionic immigration by many years, being older even than the oracular shrine of Apollo at Didyma.[3] He said that the pre-Ionic inhabitants of the city were Leleges and Lydians. Callimachus, in his Hymn to Artemis attributed the earliest temenos at Ephesus to the Amazons, whose worship he imagined already centered upon an image (bretas) of Artemis, their matron goddess. Pausanias says that Pindar believed the temple's founding Amazons to have been involved with the siege at Athens. Tacitus also believed in the Amazon foundation, however Pausanias believed the temple predated the Amazons.[4]      Modern archaeology cannot confirm Callimachus's Amazons, but Pausanias's account of the site's antiquity seems well-founded. Before World War I, site excavations by David George Hogarth identified three successive temple buildings.[5] Re-excavations in 1987–88[6] confirmed that the site was occupied as early as the Bronze Age, with a sequence of pottery finds that extend forward to Middle Geometric times, when a peripteral temple with a floor of hard-packed clay was constructed in the second half of the 8th century BC.[7] The peripteral temple at Ephesus offers the earliest example of a peripteral type on the coast of Asia Minor, and perhaps the earliest Greek temple surrounded by colonnades anywhere.      In the 7th century BC, a flood[8] destroyed the temple, depositing over half a meter of sand and flotsam over the original clay floor. Among the flood debris were the remains of a carved ivory plaque of a griffin and the Tree of Life, apparently North Syrian, and some drilled tear-shaped amber drops of elliptical cross-section. These probably once dressed a wooden effigy (xoanon) of the Lady of Ephesus, which must have been destroyed or recovered from the flood. Bammer notes that though the site was prone to flooding, and raised by silt deposits about two meters between the 8th and 6th centuries, and a further 2.4 m between the sixth and the fourth, its continued use \\"indicates that maintaining the identity of the actual location played an important role in the sacred organization\\".[9]      Temple of Artemis and the other Wonders of the Ancient World Timeline and map of theand the other Wonders of the Ancient World      Heraclitus deposited his book \\"On Nature\\" as a dedication to Artemis in the great temple.      Second phase [ edit ]      The new temple was sponsored at least in part by Croesus, who founded Lydia's empire and was overlord of Ephesus,[10] and was designed and constructed from around 550 BC by the Cretan architect Chersiphron and his son Metagenes. It was 115 m (377 ft) long and 46 m (151 ft) wide, supposedly the first Greek temple built of marble. Its peripteral columns stood some 13 m (40 ft) high, in double rows that formed a wide ceremonial passage around the cella that housed the goddess's cult image. Thirty-six of these columns were, according to Pliny, decorated by carvings in relief. A new ebony or blackened grapewood cult statue was sculpted by Endoios,[11] and a naiskos to house it was erected east of the open-air altar.      A rich foundation deposit from this era yielded more than a thousand items, including what may be the earliest coins made from the silver-gold alloy electrum. Fragments of bas-relief on the lowest drums of the temple, preserved in the British Museum, show that the enriched columns of the later temple, of which a few survive (illustration below) were versions of this earlier feature. Pliny the Elder, seemingly unaware of the ancient continuity of the sacred site, claims that the new temple's architects chose to build it on marshy ground as a precaution against earthquakes.      The temple became an important attraction, visited by merchants, kings, and sightseers, many of whom paid homage to Artemis in the form of jewelry and various goods. It also offered sanctuary to those fleeing persecution or punishment, a tradition linked in myth to the Amazons who twice fled there seeking the goddess' protection from punishment, firstly by Dionysus and later, by Heracles.      Destruction [ edit ]      In 356 BC, the temple was destroyed in a vainglorious act of arson by a man, Herostratus, who set fire to the wooden roof-beams, seeking fame at any cost; thus the term herostratic fame.[12] For this outrage, the Ephesians sentenced the perpetrator to death and forbade anyone from mentioning his name; but Theopompus later noted it.[13] In Greek and Roman historical tradition, the temple's destruction coincided with the birth of Alexander the Great (around 20/21 July 356 BC). Plutarch remarked that Artemis was too preoccupied with Alexander's delivery to save her burning temple.[14]      Third phase [ edit ]      Alexander offered to pay for the temple's rebuilding; the Ephesians tactfully refused, and eventually rebuilt it after his death, at their own expense. Work started in 323 BC and continued for many years. The third temple was larger than the second; 137 m (450 ft) long by 69 m (225 ft) wide and 18 m (60 ft) high, with more than 127 columns. Athenagoras of Athens names Endoeus, a pupil of Daedalus, as sculptor of Artemis' main cult image.[15]      A drum from the base of a column from the 4th-century rebuilding, now in the British Museum      Pausanias (c. 2nd century AD) reports another image and altar in the Temple, dedicated to Artemis Protothronia (Artemis \\"of the first seat\\") and a gallery of images above this altar, including an ancient figure of Nyx (the primordial goddess of Night) by the sculptor Rhoecus (6th century BC). Pliny describes images of Amazons, the legendary founders of Ephesus and Ephesian Artemis' original protégés, carved by Scopas. Literary sources describe the temple's adornment by paintings, columns gilded with gold and silver, and religious works of renowned Greek sculptors Polyclitus, Pheidias, Cresilas, and Phradmon.[15]      This reconstruction survived for 600 years, and appears multiple times in early Christian accounts of Ephesus. According to the New Testament, the appearance of the first Christian missionary in Ephesus caused locals to fear for the temple's dishonor.[16] The 2nd-century Acts of John includes an apocryphal tale of the temple's destruction: the apostle John prayed publicly in the Temple of Artemis, exorcising its demons and \\"of a sudden the altar of Artemis split in many pieces... and half the temple fell down,\\" instantly converting the Ephesians, who wept, prayed or took flight.[17]      Against this, a Roman edict of 162 AD acknowledges the importance of Artemesion, the annual Ephesian festival to Artemis, and officially extends it from a few holy days over March–April to a whole month, \\"one of the largest and most magnificent religious festivals in Ephesus' liturgical calendar\\".[18]      In 268 AD, the Temple was destroyed or damaged in a raid by the Goths, an East Germanic tribe;[19] in the time of emperor Gallienus: \\"Respa, Veduc and Thuruar,[20] leaders of the Goths, took ship and sailed across the strait of the Hellespont to Asia. There they laid waste many populous cities and set fire to the renowned temple of Diana at Ephesus,\\" reported Jordanes in Getica.[21] It is, however, unknown to what extent the temple was damaged.      Whatever the extent of the injuries to the building, it appears to have been rebuilt or repaired, as the temple is noted to have been in use for worship during the rise of Christianity, and closed as a consequence of the Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire.[22] However, the history of the temple between 268 and its closure by the Christian persecutions is not well known, and it is unconfirmed how big the damage of 268 was, and exactly which year it was closed by the Christians. Ammonius of Alexandria comments on the closure of the temple in his commentary of the Acts of the Apostles in the mid 5th-century, in which he gives the impression that the closure of the temple had occurred in his living memory.[22] The closure of the Temple of Artemis is assumed to have occurred sometime during the course of the early to mid 5th-century, with the year of 407 as an early date.[22] The closure of the temple was followed by the erasing of the name of Artemis from inscriptions around the city of Ephesus.[22]      Final destruction [ edit ]      It is unknown how long the building stood after the closure of the temple by the Christians. At least some of the stones from the temple were eventually used in construction of other buildings.[23] Some of the columns in Hagia Sophia originally belonged to the temple of Artemis,[24] and the Parastaseis syntomoi chronikai records the re-use of several statues and other decorative elements from the temple, throughout Constantinople.      The main primary sources for the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus are Pliny the Elder's Natural History [25], Pomponius Mela i:17, and Plutarch's Life of Alexander [26] (referencing the burning of the Artemiseum).      Rediscovery of the temple [ edit ]      The site of the temple today.      After six years of searching, the site of the temple was rediscovered in 1869 by an expedition led by John Turtle Wood and sponsored by the British Museum. These excavations continued until 1874.[27] A few further fragments of sculpture were found during the 1904–1906 excavations directed by David George Hogarth. The recovered sculptured fragments of the 4th-century rebuilding and a few from the earlier temple, which had been used in the rubble fill for the rebuilding, were assembled and displayed in the \\"Ephesus Room\\" of the British Museum.[28] In addition, the museum has part of possibly the oldest pot-hoard of coins in the world (600 BC) that had been buried in the foundations of the Archaic temple.[29]      Today the site of the temple, which lies just outside Selçuk, is marked by a single column constructed of dissociated fragments discovered on the site.      Cult and influence [ edit ]      The archaic temeton beneath the later temples clearly housed some form of \\"Great Goddess\\" but nothing is known of her cult. The literary accounts that describe it as \\"Amazonian\\" refer to the later founder-myths of Greek emigres who developed the cult and temple of Artemis Ephesia. The wealth and splendor of temple and city were taken as evidence of Artemis Ephesia's power, and were the basis for her local and international prestige: despite the successive traumas of Temple destruction, each rebuilding – a gift and honor to the goddess – brought further prosperity.[30] Large numbers of people came to Ephesus in March and in the beginning of May to attend the main Artemis Procession.[31]      Artemis' shrines, temples and festivals (Artemisia) could be found throughout the Greek world, but Ephesian Artemis was unique. The Ephesians considered her theirs, and resented any foreign claims to her protection. Once Persia ousted and replaced their Lydian overlord Croesus, the Ephesians played down his contribution to the Temple's restoration. On the whole, the Persians dealt fairly with Ephesus, but removed some religious artifacts from Artemis' Temple to Sardis and brought Persian priests into her Ephesian cult; this was not forgiven.[32] When Alexander conquered the Persians, his offer to finance the Temple's second rebuilding was politely but firmly refused.[33] Ephesian Artemis lent her city's diplomacy a powerful religious edge.      Under Hellenic rule, and later, under Roman rule, the Ephesian Artemisia festival was increasingly promoted as a key element in the pan-Hellenic festival circuit. It was part of a definitively Greek political and cultural identity, essential to the economic life of the region, and an excellent opportunity for young, unmarried Greeks of both sexes to seek out marriage partners. Games, contests and theatrical performances were held in the goddess's name, and Pliny describes her procession as a magnificent crowd-puller; it was shown in one of Apelles' best paintings, which depicted the goddess's image carried through the streets and surrounded by maidens.[34] In the Roman Imperial era, the emperor Commodus lent his name to the festival games, and might have sponsored them.[35]      Ephesian Artemis [ edit ]      Diana Efesina, Villa d'Este, Tivoli, Italy Traditional many-breasted interpretation in a 16th-century fountain of      From the Greek point of view Ephesian Artemis is a distinctive form of their goddess Artemis. In Greek cult and myth, Artemis is the twin of Apollo, a virgin huntress who supplanted the Titan Selene as goddess of the Moon. At Ephesus, a goddess whom the Greeks associated with Artemis was venerated in an archaic, certainly pre-Hellenic cult image[36] that was carved of wood and kept decorated with jewelry.      The Lady of Ephesus, 1st century AD, Ephesus Archaeological Museum xoanon An 18th-century engraving of a Roman marble copy of a Greek replica of a lost Geometric period      Robert Fleischer identified as decorations of the primitive xoanon the changeable features that since Minucius Felix and Jerome's Christian attacks on pagan popular religion had been read as many breasts or \\"eggs\\"—denoting her fertility (others interpret the objects to represent the testicles of sacrificed bulls that would have been strung on the image, with similar meaning). Most similar to Near-Eastern and Egyptian deities, and least similar to Greek ones, her body and legs are enclosed within a tapering pillar-like term, from which her feet protrude. On the coins minted at Ephesus, the apparently many-breasted goddess wears a mural crown (like a city's walls), an attribute of Cybele as a protector of cities (see polos).[36]      On the coins she rests either arm on a staff formed of entwined serpents or of a stack of ouroboroi, the eternal serpent with its tail in its mouth. In some accounts, the Lady of Ephesus was attended by eunuch priests called \\"Megabyzoi\\"; this could have been a proper name or a title. The practise of ritual self-emasculation as qualification to serve a deity is usually identified with Cybele's eunuch mendicant priests, the Galli. The Megabyzoi of Ephesian Artemis were assisted by young, virgin girls (korai).[37][38]      The \\"eggs\\" or \\"breasts\\" of the Lady of Ephesus, it now appears, must be the iconographic descendants of the amber gourd-shaped drops, elliptical in cross-section and drilled for hanging, that were rediscovered in the excavations of 1987–1988; they remained in situ where the ancient wooden cult figure of the Lady of Ephesus had been caught by an 8th-century flood (see History above). This form of breast-jewelry, then, had already been developed by the Geometric Period. A hypothesis offered by Gerard Seiterle, that the objects in Classical representations represented bulls' scrotal sacs[39] cannot be maintained.[40][41]      A votive inscription mentioned by Florence Mary Bennett,[42] which dates probably from about the 3rd century BC, associates Ephesian Artemis with Crete: \\"To the Healer of diseases, to Apollo, Giver of Light to mortals, Eutyches has set up in votive offering [a statue of] the Cretan Lady of Ephesus, the Light-Bearer.\\"      The Greek habits of syncretism assimilated all foreign gods under some form of the Olympian pantheon familiar to them—in interpretatio graeca—and it is clear that at Ephesus, the identification with Artemis that the Ionian settlers made of the \\"Lady of Ephesus\\" was slender. The Christian approach was at variance with the tolerant syncretistic approach of pagans to gods who were not theirs. A Christian inscription at Ephesus[43] suggests why so little remains at the site:      Destroying the delusive image of the demon Artemis, Demeas has erected this symbol of Truth, the God that drives away idols, and the Cross of priests, deathless and victorious sign of Christ.      The assertion that the Ephesians thought that their cult image had fallen from the sky, though it was a familiar origin-myth at other sites, is only known at Ephesus from Acts 19:35:      What man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the [image] which fell down from Jupiter?      Lynn LiDonnici observes that modern scholars are likely to be more concerned with origins of the Lady of Ephesus and her iconology than her adherents were at any point in time, and are prone to creating a synthetic account of the Lady of Ephesus by drawing together documentation that ranges over more than a millennium in its origins, creating a falsified, unitary picture, as of an unchanging icon.[44]      Panorama [ edit ]      A 360 degree panoramic view of the site of the temple      See also [ edit ]      References [ edit ]      Works cited [ edit ]      Further reading [ edit ] ||||| Sandy Hook. Aurora. Columbine. It's appalling, but one way to achieve fame in America is through acts of infamy.      What if that weren't so?      Today's media might profit by studying an example from ancient Greece on how to keep evildoers from becoming instant celebrities.      The precedent sprang from a heinous crime in 356 BC that occurred in Ephesus, a magnificent city in what is now Turkey. The city's crowning glory was an Ionic temple to the Ephesian version of the Greek goddess Artemis. Then 200 years old, the Artemisium was an exquisite wilderness of columns, art galleries and sculptured altars, acclaimed as one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.      Although the temple, all 45,000 square feet of it, drew many thousands of visitors, one obscure citizen felt no civic pride. After obsessing for years over what the world owed him, this disturbed young man decided to make a name for himself in the darkest way he could devise. One sultry night, he headed to the Artemisium and set it ablaze.      We might scoff at the notion of marble structures being destroyed by fire, but Greek temple interiors contained seasoned wood from main beams to floors, along with countless flammable art objects. Because temples were open and staffed night and day, they relied on firewood and olive oil for heat and light. For convenience, combustible materials were stored on site.      As the wooden interior of the building and its vast wooden roof burned, the young arsonist exulted, watching the 60-foot marble columns begin to crumble when fiery temperatures rose to as high as 1,000 degrees. Firefighting technology being in its infancy, the blaze continued unchecked, claiming an unknown number of human victims as well.      The perpetrator made no attempt to escape. When arrested, he boasted about his infamous act, saying he did it to make his name live forever. Local authorities promptly sentenced the young man and executed him. To keep him from profiting by his crime in the way he most ardently desired — and to discourage imitators — the Ephesians passed a law. It imposed the death penalty on anyone who ever mentioned that criminal by name again.      Although the millions of people who lived nearly 2,400 years ago lacked what we would call mass media or instant long-distance communication, they certainly communicated — and faster than you would think.      Despite the age-old tendency of humans to gossip, that long-ago name ban had remarkable staying power. With one tacky exception, historians and writers, both Greek and Roman, retold the story for centuries without naming the criminal at its heart. (And you won't catch me mentioning his name either.) Furthermore, the Ephesians rebuilt their glorious temple, which remained a world wonder for an additional 600 years.      Marginalized men with murderous plans have been around for millenniums, but we have forgotten how to take away what they most prize, the \\"I'll show 'em\\" notoriety that enables evildoers to win immortality. We have surrendered to shabbier motives, such as selling newspapers or winning TV news ratings.      Would such a ban work in today's world, given our hungry media cycles, our insistence on free speech even when it harms? Maybe not. But infamy should not be rewarded with headlines. Or personal recognition.      Long-ago cultures — Egyptian, Greek and Roman — also made it a point to censure certain individuals by inflicting a similar punishment. In Latin, it was called damnatio memoriae: to castigate by erasing one's name and deeds from public memory. In our time, damning killers in such a way is surely worth a try.

The temple was completely rebuilt three times, and in its final form, it was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. By 401 AD, it had been ruined or destroyed, with only foundations and fragments of the last temple remaining at the site. The earliest version of the temple dates back to the Bronze Age and was attributed to the Amazons. The temple was located near the ancient city of Ephesus, about 75 km south of the modern port city of İzmir, in Turkey. The sacred site was occupied as early as the Bronze Age and was constructed in the second half of the 8th century BC. In the 7th century BC, the temple was destroyed by a flood, but it was reconstructed, in more grandiose form, around 550 BC under the Cretan architect Chersiphron and his son Metagenes. It was funded by Croesus of Lydia and took 10 years to complete. This version was destroyed in 356 BC by Herostratus in an act of arson. The final and greatest form of the temple was funded by the Ephesians themselves. The Temple of Artemis became an important attraction, visited by merchants, kings, and sightseers. It also offered sanctuary to those fleeing persecution or punishment. The temple was destroyed or damaged in 268 AD in a raid by the Goths. The history of the temple between 268 and its closure by Christian persecutions is not well known. The site of the temple was rediscovered in 1869 by an expedition led by John Turtle Wood and sponsored by the British Museum.

As I prepared to leave my apartment at 6:30 pm, I couldn't help but feel a mix of excitement and anxiety. This party was a long-awaited reunion of my college friends, and we hadn't seen each other in years. We had all gone our separate ways after graduation, chasing careers and life goals, but tonight was our chance to reconnect and reminisce about the good old days. As I arrived at the party venue, it was obvious everyone else felt the same eagerness to catch up. There were hugs and laughter all around, and the atmosphere was warm and nostalgic. We all dove into conversations, quickly getting absorbed in recounting memories and sharing stories of our lives over the past years. We talked about our successes and challenges, our joys and sorrows, and the people we had met along the way. It was a night filled with emotion as we reconnected with the people who once played such an integral part in our lives. Suddenly, I glanced at my wristwatch and felt a sinking realization: it was already 9:15 pm. There was no way I could catch the 9:30 train - the last train of the night - that would take me home. I was frustrated because I knew that missing the train would mean having to spend a significant amount on a last-minute hotel room. Despite my worries, my friends reassured me that everything would work out. They pointed out that trains often run late, and I should at least give it a shot before resigning myself to staying overnight. Taking their advice, we quickly bid farewell to one another, promising to not let so much time pass before our next reunion. With the map app on my phone guiding me, I raced to the train station, arriving just in time to see that the train was delayed by 15 minutes. Thankful for the extra time, I purchased my ticket and caught my breath as I waited on the platform. As the train pulled into the station, I felt grateful for the unexpected delay and the opportunity it gave me to enjoy the party without having to cut the night short. I found my seat on the train and settled in for the ride home, reflecting on the incredible evening I had spent with my friends. The laughter, the deep conversations, and the joy I experienced tonight would forever be etched in my memory. It made me realize that despite the years that had passed and the distances between us, the bonds we had formed in college remained strong. The delay of the train had worked out in my favor, bringing me not only relief but also clarity: the importance of maintaining connections with the people who had been there during some of the most formative years of my life. As the train made its way through the dark countryside towards my home, I made a silent promise to myself that I would make more of an effort to nurture these friendships in the coming years. After all, life is filled with uncertainties and surprises, much like the unexpected delay of a train.

However, owing to people not paying attention, interrupting, and cutting Elwood off as he is about to introduce his imaginary friend, it doesn't imediately appear that there is anything wrong with him, although the examining doctor is sure he is doing the right thing by admitting him..Elwood is carted upstairs by a rough-handed and simple-minded man in the white coat while the examining doctor ushers the sister into the head psychiatrist's --Dr. Chumley's-- office to give a description of the problem. As Elwood is \\"escorted\\" to hydrotherapy, he tells the man in the white coat his friend \\"Harvey\\" is a \\"Pooka\\" The Aide later looks up the definition in the dictionary: \\"Celtic mythology, a miscihevous spirit that takes animal form and appears sometimes to some people for the purpose of doing this and that.\\"As Veta, still highly upset over Elwood driving away her friends, bemoans Elwoods delusions to Dr. Chumley, her frazzled manner and insistence that Elwood actually does have a six foot 3 inch invisible rabbit for a friend convinces Chumley it is she, not Elwood, who is hallucinating.He quickly has Veta carted upstairs and, fearing a lawsuit for incarcerating and treating a sane man, brings Elwood down and makes every manner of friendly gesture, including firing the examining doctor, Dr. Sanderson .

This is because the speaker mentions that they had stripped (most likely referring to removing the old wallpaper) and then had someone else come in to put up the new paper. The speaker then reflects on their experience and expresses that they would do it differently next time - they would let the other person strip and then hang the paper themselves. The statement implies that the speaker seemed to be more satisfied with the other person's ability to hang the wallpaper professionally, and they might have been more efficient or better at the task. Meanwhile, the speaker might have found the stripping process more difficult, time-consuming, or frustrating than expected. Consequently, they believe that allowing the other person to strip the old wallpaper while they hang the new one would make the process more efficient and satisfactory. In conclusion, based on the speaker's reflection and desire to reverse the roles of the task in the future, the hypothesis \\"I did it the wrong way this time because I should've let them strip.\\" can be assumed to be true. The speaker expresses a desire to change their approach, which indicates that their initial method was not optimal for their satisfaction or efficiency in completing the task.

He governed Libya as Revolutionary Chairman of the Libyan Arab Republic from 1969 to 1977 and then as the \\"Brotherly Leader\\" of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya from 1977 to 2011. Initially ideologically committed to Arab nationalism and Arab socialism, he came to rule according to his own Third International Theory before embracing Pan-Africanism and serving as Chairperson of the African Union from 2009 to 2010. What political philosophy did Gaddifi create?","output":"Muammar Muhammad Abu Minyar al-Gaddafi, commonly referred to as Colonel Gaddafi, was a Libyan revolutionary, politician, and political theorist who created his own political philosophy known as the Third International Theory. Initially ideologically committed to Arab nationalism and Arab socialism, Gaddafi developed the Third International Theory as a unique approach to governance, encapsulating aspects of Arab nationalism, socialism, and direct democracy. The Third International Theory was primarily outlined in Gaddafi's \\"Green Book,\\" which was published in three parts between 1975 and 1981. The Green Book aimed to provide an alternative to both capitalism and communism, and it largely rejected the notion of political parties; instead, it advocated for direct democracy through people's committees and a decentralized political system. Central to the Third International Theory is the belief in self-sufficiency and self-reliance, both on a national and individual level. This includes the decentralization of political power, economic management, and social responsibilities to the masses, thereby empowering the people and reducing the influence of centralized bureaucracy. Furthermore, the Green Book championed social and economic equality. It emphasized the need for equal distribution of wealth and resources, and it urged the abolishment of traditional wage labor systems in favor of individual ownership and cooperatives. In terms of foreign policy and international relations, the Third International Theory strongly advocated for anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism, striving to promote a unified Arab and African front in order to resist external influence and domination. In essence, Gaddafi's Third International Theory was an amalgamation of various political ideologies, including elements of Arab nationalism, socialism, direct democracy, and Pan-Africanism. Gaddafi strived to create a unique and self-sufficient political philosophy tailored to the specific needs and aspirations of the Libyan people and the wider Arab and African region. Consequently, his ideas formed the basis for his rule over Libya as the \\"Brotherly Leader\\" of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya from 1977 until his fall from power in 2011."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Here's the step-by-step justification for this answer: 1. Analyzing the question: The question asks for the worst result of smoking, so we need to consider the severity and impact of each option on an individual's life. 2. Eliminating weaker options: Options like \\"looking cool\\", \\"bad breath\\", and \\"pleasure\\" have either positive or relatively minor negative consequences when compared to the other options. Therefore, we can exclude them from being the worst result. 3. Comparing remaining options: We now have two options left, \\"lung disease\\" and \\"death\\". While lung disease is a severe consequence of smoking and can lead to a significant decline in the quality of life, it still ranks lower than death in terms of severity and impact. 4. Selecting the worst result: Death is the most severe and irreversible consequence of smoking. It not only affects the individual but also their family and friends. The loss of life and its potential value is the worst possible outcome related to smoking.

Different models of System/360 had different internal data path widths; the IBM System/360 Model 30 (1965) implemented the 32-bit System/360 architecture, but had an 8 bit native path width, and performed 32-bit arithmetic 8 bits at a time.  - The IBM System/360 Model 30 was a low-end member of the IBM System/360 family. It was announced on April 7, 1964, shipped in 1965, and withdrawn on October 7, 1977.  - The ZX81 is a home computer produced by Sinclair Research and manufactured in Scotland by Timex Corporation. It was launched in the United Kingdom in March 1981 as the successor to Sinclair's ZX80 and was designed to be a low-cost introduction to home computing for the general public. It was hugely successful, and more than 1.5 million units were sold before it was discontinued. The ZX81 found commercial success in many other countries, notably the United States, where it was initially sold as the ZX-81. Timex manufactured and distributed it under licence and enjoyed a substantial but brief boom in sales. Timex later produced its own versions of the ZX81 for the US market  the Timex Sinclair 1000 and Timex Sinclair 1500. Unauthorised clones of the ZX81 were produced in several countries.  - Don Priestley (born 1940) is a video game programmer who wrote for the ZX81 and ZX Spectrum between 1982 and 1989.  - The ZX Spectrum is an 8-bit personal home computer released in the United Kingdom in 1982 by Sinclair Research Ltd. It was manufactured in Dundee, Scotland, in the now closed Timex factory.  - The IBM System/360 (S/360) is a mainframe computer system family that was announced by IBM on April 7, 1964, and delivered between 1965 and 1978. It was the first family of computers designed to cover the complete range of applications, from small to large, both commercial and scientific. The design made a clear distinction between architecture and implementation, allowing IBM to release a suite of compatible designs at different prices. All but the incompatible model 44 and the most expensive systems used microcode to implement the instruction set, which featured 8-bit byte addressing and binary, decimal and (hexadecimal) floating-point calculations.  - A game programmer is a software engineer, programmer, or computer scientist who primarily develops codebases for video games or related software, such as game development tools.

In this task, you are given an abstract of article. Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words. Objective. Chemotherapeutic agents function by inducing apoptosis and their effectiveness depends on the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins in cells. Due to the complicated interactions of the many proteins involved, it has been difficult to determine in tumors whether overexpression of single genes is prognostic for increased resistance. Therefore, we studied the influence of bcl-2 overexpression on resistance to chemotherapeutics in a transgenic mouse system. This allowed us to study a wide variety of cells, including important but rare populations such as hematopoietic stem cells (HSC).Methods. H2K-bcl-2 transgenic and wild-type (WT) mice were treated with several agents(5-fluoruracil, cyclophosphamide, and busulfan) to determine the contribution of increased amounts of bcl-2 to the response to these chemotherapeutics in vivo. Populations were enumerated using flow cytometry. HSC were studied by FACS purification and long-term reconstitution assays in vivo and resistance was confirmed by short-term proliferation assays with different amounts of chemotherapeutics in vitro. Results. bcl-2 overexpression alone protects many cell types, though protection levels differ between populations and agents. However, even sensitive populations return to pretreatment levels faster in transgenic mice. bcl-2 overexpression also prevents the dramatic changes in HSC following 5-FU treatment (downregulation of c-kit, upregulation of Lin, less efficient long-term reconstitution). In vitro studies directly demonstrate increased resistance of bcl-2 overexpressing HSC to chemotherapeutic agents. Conclusions. Increased expression of bcl-2 in HSC and their progeny endows these cells with broad resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. The ability to (differentially) regulate sensitivity to apoptosis of bystander and tumor cells is clinically important.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? jones has delivered a solidly entertaining and moving family drama .","output":"The following review indicates a positive opinion of the movie. The key phrases that support this interpretation are \\"solidly entertaining\\" and \\"moving family drama.\\" The writer uses these adjectives to express satisfaction and admiration for the film. Allow me to break down the review to further elaborate on the reasoning behind this positive interpretation: 1. \\"Jones has delivered\\": The use of the word \\"delivered\\" suggests that the filmmaker, presumably named Jones, has successfully produced a movie that effectively conveys its intended message, genre, or theme. This implies that the reviewer commends the director's execution of the film. 2. \\"Solidly entertaining\\": This phrase emphasizes that the movie has a consistent level of entertainment value that is enjoyable throughout. The use of the term \\"solidly\\" demonstrates that the reviewer not only found the film pleasurable to watch but also appreciated its cohesive and well-rounded nature. 3. \\"And moving\\": By describing the movie as \\"moving,\\" the reviewer indicates that the family drama possesses emotional depth and resonance that effectively engages the audience. This conveys that the film has left a notable impact on the viewer, contributing to the overall positive impression. 4. \\"Family drama\\": Though not directly indicative of a positive or negative tone, the mention of \\"family drama\\" clarifies the genre that this movie fits into. The pairing of this genre with adjectives such as \\"solidly entertaining\\" and \\"moving\\" illustrates that the reviewer approves of the movie's handling of family-centric themes and storytelling. Given these points, it is clear that the review has a positive opinion of the movie. The reviewer appreciates the film's ability to engage, entertain, and elicit emotions from the audience while telling a compelling family narrative."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. In 1975, after ten years of studiowork and artistically successful yet obscure solo records, Fischer found a new direction. Just like Hancock and Chick Corea he was a pioneer on the electric keyboard, and in that capacity he joined vibraphonist Cal Tjader's group. The reunion with Tjader gave a new impulse to Fischer's love of Latin-American music. He started his own group with Latino musicians, \\"Salsa Picante\\", which showed great eclecticism in musical styles. Later he expanded to include four vocalists billed separately as \\"2 + 2\\".  The album 2+2 won a Grammy in 1981. After that he recorded And Sometimes Voices and Free Fall with the vocal group. Free Fall was nominated in three categories for the Grammy Awards and won under the category of \\"Best Jazz Album By A Vocal Duo Or Group\\". Crazy Bird was with the instrumental group and Alone Together, a solo piano album recorded on a Hamburg Steinway. It was recorded for Hans Georg Brunner-Schwer and the German company MPS Records.  In the seventies, Fischer began doing orchestral sweeteners for R&B groups. His nephew, Andre Fischer, was the drummer of the band Rufus, featuring Chaka Khan. \\"Apparently the arrangements I made for their early records were appreciated, for in the following years I was hired almost exclusively by black artists.\\" Among the artists Fischer worked for are The Jacksons, Earl Klugh, Switch, Debarge, Shotgun (a late 70s offshoot of 24-Carat Black) and Atlantic Starr. His walls are now covered with gold and platinum records from these recordings, Grammy Award Nominations, and several NARAS MVP Awards, culminating in an MVP-emeritus in 1985.  Once his fame as an arranger was established, Fischer also worked with pop musicians like Paul McCartney, Prince, Celine Dion and Robert Palmer. \\"I am surprised that my arrangements are now considered one of the prerequisites for a hit album. People feel that they make a song sound almost classical.\\"  Classical concert artist Richard Stoltzman commissioned him in 1983 to write a symphonic work using Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn themes. The result, \\"The Duke, Swee'pea and Me\\", an eleven and a half minute orchestral work, was performed with a symphony orchestra and Stoltzman on clarinet all around the world. Answer this question \\"What work did he do with them?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"Fischer worked with them as an electric keyboard player, arranger, and composer. He made arrangements for their music and helped create a unique sound for different artists, which contributed to their hit albums."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Went straight from a facility that deals with homeless children (492 1st Ave, Manhattan, New York) to the extreme outskirts of Queens near Kennedy Airport about 20 miles away. It was winter and I had no coat. I had my book bag and my sole Trader Joe’s bag of clothing and was loaded into a van with three social workers. During the long drive in traffic, I fell asleep, so waking up at my new home, I couldn’t make out any street signs and the numbering on the houses did not indicate whether I was in a home in the Bronx or Eastern Queens (which share the same street numbering in certain instances). My foster parents showed me my room and left a plate of food on the table. They barricaded themselves in their bedroom quite like how pilots barricade themselves behind the fortified cockpit door. However, my room didn’t have a lock, and neither did the bathroom. There were bars on my windows with a view of a church parking lot. I took great care to avoid waking a significantly older teen (I was 14, so he must have been 19–20) sleeping on the other bed. I heard two other kids (my foster siblings) in the other room playing music and giggling loudly at 3 in the morning. At 4 in the morning, my foster father started reading the Quran pretty loudly, and then he goes back to bed. In the morning, my foster parents are gone. My foster siblings are all sleeping. I got up at 7, but I don’t know how far I am from my high school, what buses/train will take me there, and still don’t know anything about anything about my new home. I don’t even know the names of those I’m relegated to living with. The unnerving strangeness and disorientation hat comes with knowing that your life has changed and the culture shock that comes with that is so scary and desensitizes you on that first day. How long did the trip take from the homeless facility to Queens outskirts? - less than an hour - not enough information - 6 hours - 14 hours A:","output":"The experience you've described certainly paints a vivid picture of the disorientation and uncertainty that can come from being placed in a new living situation, especially as a young individual. The unfamiliarity of the environment, the lack of information about the people you're sharing the home with, and the anxiety of not knowing how to get to and from important places like school would undoubtedly be overwhelming. Based on your description, the trip from the homeless facility at 492 1st Ave, Manhattan, New York, to the extreme outskirts of Queens near Kennedy Airport, which is around 20 miles away, likely did not take 6 hours or 14 hours - these durations are significantly longer than what would be expected for a 20-mile journey, even in heavy traffic. Instead, it is plausible that the trip took less than an hour or perhaps slightly more, given that traffic in the New York City area can be unpredictable and delays are common. It's important to keep in mind that adjusting to a new home and living situation can take time. It's crucial to find ways to make the space feel more like your own and to build connections with the people you're sharing the home with. Establishing a routine, getting acquainted with the local area, understanding transportation options, and opening communication channels with your foster family are all steps that can help ease the transition. In any case, the first day in a new environment - particularly one as disorienting as you've described - may be challenging, but as time goes on and familiarity grows, it is hoped that a sense of stability and belonging can be established."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Second question: What are the signs in Whatsapp when they blocked and deleted you from their phone book? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First question: Is there a way to delete WhatsApp's chat history from both yours and your recipient's phones? Answer: Deleting chat history in WhatsApp is only possible on your own device. You have no control over the chat history on your recipient's device or their settings that pertain to the retention of the chat history. However, you can follow these steps to delete chat history on your device: 1. Open the WhatsApp application on your phone. 2. Locate and open the chat conversation you want to delete. 3. Tap on the chat subject (usually the contact name or group name) at the top of the screen to open the chat settings. 4. Scroll down and tap on \\"Clear Chat\\" or \\"Delete Chat.\\" For Android users, tap on the three vertical dots on the upper right corner of the screen, then tap \\"More\\" followed by \\"Clear Chat.\\" 5. Confirm your selection to delete the chat history on your device. It is important to note that deleting the chat history on your device will not affect the chat history on the recipient's device. Second question: What are the signs in Whatsapp when they blocked and deleted you from their phone book? Answer: It can be challenging to confirm if someone has blocked and deleted you from their phone book on WhatsApp. However, there are a few signs that may indicate this: 1. Last Seen status: If you can no longer view the person's WhatsApp \\"last seen\\" status, it could be a sign that they have blocked you. However, this may not always be definitive, as users can change their privacy settings to prevent others from seeing their \\"last seen\\" status. 2. Profile Picture and Status: If the person’s profile picture and status do not update or disappear altogether, it may suggest that they have blocked or deleted you from their contacts. However, this is not definite as the person may have opted to hide their profile picture and status from everyone or only share with specific contacts. 3. Sent messages only having a single tick: When you send a message in WhatsApp, it initially shows one grey tick, which means the message was sent. If the message is delivered, it shows a second grey tick. When the recipient reads the message, both ticks turn blue. If the message only shows a single grey tick and never progresses to the second tick, it may indicate that you have been blocked. However, this may not always be the case as it could be due to network issues or if the person's phone is turned off. 4. Unable to add them to a group chat: If you attempt to add the person to a WhatsApp group chat and receive an error message, it could be a sign that they have blocked you. However, it is important to have a group admin try adding the contact to verify this information. 5. Calling feature not connecting: If you try calling the person via WhatsApp and the call doesn't go through, it could be an indication that you have been blocked. However, this might not be definitive as the person might be on a different call or have connectivity issues. It is essential to understand that these signs are not definitive proof that you have been blocked or deleted from someone's phone book. They may have enabled certain privacy features or could be experiencing network issues, which give the same appearance. Lastly, to answer whether these two questions are asking the same thing: No, they are not. The first question pertains to deleting chat history, while the second question focuses on the signs of being blocked and deleted from someone's phone book in WhatsApp. These are two separate aspects of using the WhatsApp application."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

She discovers an ancient box while water-witching and her Aunt takes it back to their house. Her boyfriend, Gordon (William Reynolds), goes for an archaeologist, arguing the box should be kept intact for appraisal and opening by an expert. However, the Aunt's greedy ranch foreman, anticipating treasure, secretly convinces the slow-witted handyman to break it open. Instead, the box contains the intact head of Gideon Drew (Robin Hughes), a man executed for sorcery 400 years earlier. The head awakens and telepathically takes over the mentally vulnerable handyman. After murdering the foreman, the head has the handyman conceal it while arranging to have a coffin retrieved containing Gideon's body. After the handyman helps the head take control of a young woman (Andra Martin) staying at the ranch, it drives him to approach police in a threatening manner holding the knife that killed the foreman.

The film, based on the German fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm, was a pioneering achievement in the animation industry and played a significant role in solidifying the reputation of the Walt Disney Studios as a leading producer of animated films. The creation of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was a massive undertaking for the studio; it took over three years to complete, involved around 750 artists, and cost an estimated 1.5 million at the time, which was a substantial sum for a film budget during the Great Depression. The production was initially referred to as \\"Disney's Folly\\" by industry insiders, as many doubted that a full-length animated feature would succeed. However, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs became an enormous success upon its release, earning critical acclaim and an impressive box-office return. The film's groundbreaking achievements were also recognized with an Honorary Academy Award for Walt Disney, presented as one statuette and seven miniature statuettes, symbolizing the film's story and characters.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Geisinger, a Health Insurer, Pays More to Save More Laura Pedrick for The New York Times Dr. Richard Martin touches base with a patient, Marie Jones, while Mary Solomon, right, a registered nurse, looks on. Like a lot of doctors, Patrick Kilduff has too many patients and too little time. He and the five other physicians in Shavertown, Pa., oversee the care of about 12,000 people, and a typical office visit lasts just 15 minutes. Because health insurers pay him as little as 45 per visit, Dr. Kilduff and his colleagues say they have little choice but to squeeze as many patients as they can into their day. That makes it virtually impossible to spend time explaining to patients the importance of keeping their blood sugar under control or how to take their medicine. But the insurers’ penny-wise approach can lead to as much as 1 million in hospital bills, if a person with under-treated diabetes has a heart attack. That is why some of the nation’s insurers are now trying to avoid those high medical bills by taking the longer view. They are giving primary care doctors more help — and more money — to take care of the sickest patients and help prevent them from becoming sicker. Otherwise, insurers know they risk being overwhelmed by rising health care costs as an older, sicker population copes with serious chronic conditions. “The essential business model of medical insurance will have to change,” said Dr. Glenn D. Steele Jr., the chief executive of Geisinger Health System, which operates a network of clinics and hospitals in Pennsylvania. Geisinger is known nationally for its innovative approaches to delivering high-quality care at lower cost. It also owns a health insurance plan that covers about 250,000 people — including many of Dr. Kilduff’s patients in Shavertown. As an insurer, Geisinger now pays the salaries of extra nurses in doctors’ offices, whose full-time job is to help patients with chronic diseases stay on top of their conditions and, ideally, out of the hospital. The doctors, including Dr. Kilduff, help hire the nurses, who work closely with the doctors to oversee the patients’ care. The nurses make sure patients who need quick appointments are squeezed in, and they alert the doctors to any early indications of trouble by keeping in close contact with the patients and looking out for the results of patients’ lab tests. One of Dr. Kilduff’s patients, Rose Ann Cox, 69 years old, began working a few years ago with a Geisinger-paid nurse, Karen Thomas, to control her diabetes, talking by phone at least once a week. Ms. Cox had gone to the emergency room when her blood sugars were too low, but she has not been in the hospital for about three years now. “You don’t always think you should call the doctor,” Ms. Cox said. But she has no qualms about reaching out to the nurse. The initiative is part of an overall effort by Geisinger and other insurers to create a so-called medical home — the place where patients’ care is carefully coordinated by a doctor and staff, with particular attention given to the chronically ill. Geisinger began experimenting with this approach three and a half years ago and now uses it in 37 practices, most of which are part of its own network of doctors’ offices. But five of the doctors’ offices, including Dr. Kilduff’s, are independent practices that accept Geisinger as one of several insurance plans. Under the arrangement with the outside doctors, Geisinger pays for the nurses and shares with the doctors any savings they can achieve by reducing medical expenses. So far, Geisinger says it is pleased with the early results. In an unpublished review of 2008 data, Geisinger experienced an 18 percent drop in hospital admissions; overall medical expenses fell 7 percent. Geisinger expects to publish a study on its results later this year. The doctors involved in the Geisinger experiment say they would not hesitate to hospitalize a patient if necessary. Part of the nurses’ work, in fact, is to keep tabs on anyone who is admitted and make sure a treatment plan is in place when a patient is discharged. Many other insurers are also trying new, similar ways of rewarding primary care doctors. “What we’re trying to do is get doctors off the traditional fee-for-service hamster wheel,” said Dr. Gus Manocchia, the chief medical officer for Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Rhode Island, a nonprofit insurer that started a program similar to Geisinger’s earlier this year. “A lot of the Blues plans are at least thinking about this, if they haven’t started it already.” WellPoint, Aetna and Cigna, which are some of the nation’s largest for-profit insurers, are also flirting with the concept. In one case, in Texas, a nurse whose salary is paid by Cigna discovered that a diabetic patient was missing check-ups and not filling his prescriptions because he had lost his job. He was insured through his wife, but without his income the couple could no longer afford to pay his share of the cost of prescriptions or the co-payments for the office visit. The nurse worked with the doctor to find cheaper medicines for the man and arranged for him to pay back his share of the cost of office visits over time. By getting this patient’s diabetes under control, the insurer very likely avoided paying what could have been a 500,000 or 1 million claim to treat a heart attack or start kidney dialysis, said David Toomey, Cigna’s general manager for north Texas, where the insurer is starting to experiment with such programs. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"This article is about a health insurer called Geisinger, which is trying to save money by paying doctors more to help take care of very sick patients. The idea is to prevent patients from getting sicker and going to the hospital, where the bills can get very expensive. Geisinger pays for extra nurses to work with the doctors and keep a close eye on patients with serious health issues, like diabetes. This new system is called a \\"medical home\\" and has helped lower hospital visits and medical expenses.

Complete the passage: pick from possible candidates. (CNN) -- Eight years ago, the Democratic presidential candidates had the luxury of running against George W. Bush. Their main foreign-policy message was that they were different from the incumbent: They were against the war in Iraq; against the way Bush was conducting the war on terrorism; against his unilateral approach to world affairs. In 2016, things will be different. The candidates will have to be much more careful about distancing themselves from President Obama's policies. While they will be able to critique him and highlight how they would try do better, they will also face great pressure to outline their own visions for their future.

The correct answer is \\"Bush's war in Iraq\\" because in the passage, it talks about how the Democratic presidential candidates were against George W. Bush's actions and decisions, including the war in Iraq.  The other options are incorrect because: - Biden's war in Iraq: Joe Biden did not start the war in Iraq; George W. Bush did. - CNN's war in Iraq: CNN is a news channel and did not start the war in Iraq. - Clinton's war in Iraq: Hillary Clinton did not start the war in Iraq; George W. Bush did. - Democratic's war in Iraq: It was not started by the Democratic Party but by Republican President George W. Bush. - George W. Bush's war...: This is the correct answer. - Iraq's war in Iraq: This option does not make sense, as countries don't start wars against themselves. - Julian Zelizer's war...: Julian Zelizer is an author and a professor, and has no involvement in starting wars. - NATO's war in Iraq: NATO did not start the war in Iraq; George W. Bush did. - Obama's war in Iraq: Barack Obama was not the president when the war in Iraq began; George W. Bush was. - U.N.'s war in Iraq: The United Nations did not start the war in Iraq; George W. Bush did. - U.S.'s war in Iraq: This option might seem correct, but it is less specific than the correct answer, which names the president who started the war. - Zelizer's war in Iraq: This is repeating the wrong option previously mentioned.

Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Who has more anaerobic bacteria in their garden's soil?  Bobby and Ned are two neighbors who both have medium sized gardens in their backyards. They regularly talk to each other about what they are growing and share gardening tips. Bobby is out working in his garden when Ned comes over to chat. Ned mentions that the garden at his house is currently flooded, but he's not sure why since it didn't rain. He asks him if Bobby's garden experienced the same thing. Bobby replies that his garden is not currently flooded. He does mention that he did see Ned's daughter walking around near Ned's garden carrying a hose turned on to full power.  Hint: Diffusion of carbon dioxide and oxygen is approximately 10,000 times slower in water than in air. When soils are flooded, they quickly lose oxygen, becoming hypoxic (an environment with O2 concentration below 2 mg/liter) and eventually completely anoxic where anaerobic bacteria thrive among the roots. Water also influences the intensity and spectral composition of light as it reflects off the water surface and submerged particles. Aquatic plants exhibit a wide variety of morphological and physiological adaptations that allow them to survive, compete, and diversify in these environments. For example, their roots and stems contain large air spaces (aerenchyma) that regulate the efficient transportation of gases (for example, CO2 and O2) used in respiration and photosynthesis. Salt water plants (halophytes) have additional specialized adaptations, such as the development of special organs for shedding salt and osmoregulating their internal salt (NaCl) concentrations, to live in estuarine, brackish, or oceanic environments. Anaerobic soil microorganisms in aquatic environments use nitrate, manganese ions, ferric ions, sulfate, carbon dioxide, and some organic compounds; other microorganisms are facultative anaerobes and use oxygen during respiration when the soil becomes drier. The activity of soil microorganisms and the chemistry of the water reduces the oxidation-reduction potentials of the water. Carbon dioxide, for example, is reduced to methane (CH4) by methanogenic bacteria. The physiology of fish is also specially adapted to compensate for environmental salt levels through osmoregulation. Their gills form electrochemical gradients that mediate salt excretion in salt water and uptake in fresh water. Answer:","output":"Based on the information given in the paragraph, Ned has more anaerobic bacteria in his garden's soil. This is because his garden is currently flooded. When soils are flooded, they quickly lose oxygen and become anoxic environments that favor the growth of anaerobic bacteria. On the other hand, Bobby's garden is not flooded, so it is less likely to have a high concentration of anaerobic bacteria."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: Earlier this week, @naval (CEO and co-founder of AngelList) asked a question on Twitter: \\"The challenge of the next decade is not Artificial Intelligence, but Human Intelligence. Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What experience does the author credit with teaching him about knowledge workers?

Parties interested in the estate should go to the Laurel mansion for the reading of the will. Stan can't remember if Ebeneezer is a relative or not but they decide to go to the mansion anyway. They arrive during a thunderstorm and discover that Ebeneezer had been murdered and that the police had placed the notice in the newspaper to draw all of the relatives together to find out who committed the crime. Stan and Ollie are shown to a bedroom to sleep overnight, which is the room in which Ebeneezer was murdered. They hear a strange noise and in the darkness see a pair of eyes which turns out to be a cat. They then hear a scream and decide to investigate. Meanwhile, the butler is calling all of the relatives to a study telling them they have a phone call. After sitting in a chair and lifting the handset of the phone, the lights go out, there is a scream and a sound like a door slamming, and the relative is never seen again. Stan and Ollie return to their bedroom and get into the bed but a bat has flown into their room and is under their covers, which causes them to panic and run downstairs.

Question: suppose fewer organisms die happens, how will it affect more bones are left behind.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"If fewer organisms die, it will result in fewer bones being left behind. This is because the number of decomposing organisms correlates with the number of bones left behind for the fossilization process. So, the correct answer would be: B: Less When there are fewer organisms dying, the number of bones available for the decomposition process will be lower. This means that there will be fewer bones left to be scattered by scavengers, wind, and rain. Consequently, the number of bones undergoing fossilization will decrease. As fewer bones are left behind to be buried by sand and soil, there will be a reduced chance of the proteins in those bones being replaced by minerals, leading to fewer newly formed fossils. The final effect would be an overall decrease in the discovery of fossils due to fewer bones being involved in the entire process.

Oldman was born in New Cross, London, the son of Leonard Bertram Oldman (1921-1985), a former sailor who also worked as a welder, and Kathleen (nee Cheriton; born 1919). He has stated that Leonard was an alcoholic who left the family when Oldman was seven years old. Oldman attended West Greenwich School in Deptford, leaving school at the age of 16 to work in a sports shop. He was a pianist as a child, and later a singer, but gave up his musical aspirations to pursue an acting career after seeing Malcolm McDowell's performance in the 1971 film The Raging Moon. Oldman was charged with drunk driving in 1991 after a night out in Los Angeles with actor Kiefer Sutherland. A deputy city attorney stated that Oldman's blood alcohol content was found to be more than twice California's limit for legal intoxication.  Some media outlets reported that Oldman was unhappy with The Contender (2000) because DreamWorks had edited the film to reflect pro-Democratic leanings, stirring controversy. The claims were declared \\"sloppy sensationalism\\" by Oldman's manager, Urbanski, who said that Oldman was \\"the least political person he knew\\", that \\"neither he nor Oldman had made the statements attributed to them,\\" that they had \\"produced the film every last cut and frame,\\" and that \\"DreamWorks did not influence the final cut or have anything to do with it.\\" It has been suggested that Oldman was blacklisted in Hollywood for several years as a result.  In an interview in the July/August 2014 issue of Playboy magazine while promoting Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Oldman criticized what he saw as excessive political correctness in American media and the entertainment industry's own discriminating hypocrisy, and argued in support of former controversial celebrities Mel Gibson and Alec Baldwin. He stressed that he did not relate with most of their viewpoints, but regarding the former, agreed, \\"Gibson is in a town that's run by Jews\\" (referring to Hollywood). After criticism from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), Oldman apologised to them in an open letter. ADL director Abraham Foxman acknowledged that Oldman was remorseful, but felt his letter was insufficient and asked for \\"a little more introspection, a little more understanding and a little more education\\". Oldman then made a public apology on the 25 June edition of late-night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live!, where he stressed that he was \\"profoundly sorry\\" for his \\"insensitive, pernicious and ill-informed\\" remarks.","output":"This text is about the actor Gary Oldman."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The answer to one of the clues is Murphy's Law: anything that can go wrong, will go wrong. This is exactly the case for Dan Burns (Steve Carell, the Office) a columnist for the local newspaper. Dan is an expert at giving advice for everyday life, yet he comes to realize that things aren't so picture perfect in his own. Dan in Real Life is amazing at capturing these ironies of everyday life and is successful at embracing the comedy, tragedy, and beauty of them all. Besides that this movie is pretty damn hilarious. The death of his wife forces Dan to raise his three daughters all on his own... each daughter in their own pivotal stages in life: the first one anxious to try out her drivers license, the middle one well into her teenage angst phase, and the youngest one drifting away from early childhood. Things take a turn for Dan when he goes to Rhode Island for a family reunion and stumbles across an intriguing woman in a bookstore. Her name is Marie (Juliette Binoche, Chocolat) and she is looking for a book to help her avoid awkward situations... which is precisely whats in store when they get thrown into the Burns Family household. If you've seen Steve Carell in The Office or Little Miss Sunshine, you'd know that he is incomparable with comedic timing and a tremendously dynamic actor as well. Steve Carell is awesome at capturing all the emotions that come with family life: the frustration and sincere compassion. The family as well as the house itself provides a warm environment for the movie that contrasts the inner turmoil that builds throughout the movie and finally bursts out in a pretty suspenseful climax. The movie only falls short in some of the predictable outcomes, yet at the same time life is made up of both irony and predictability: which is an irony within itself. Dan in Real Life is definitely worth seeing, for the sole enjoyment of watching all the funny subtleties we often miss in everyday life, and I'll most likely enjoy it a second time, or even a third. Just \\"put it on my tab.\\" Now, what is this review like? OPTIONS: [A]. negative; [B]. positive;","output":"The review is [B]. positive. The writer seems to be fond of the movie \\"Dan in Real Life,\\" and has a lot of nice things to say about it. They think it's funny, and they appreciate the way it shows some of the funny little moments in everyday life. They even say they'd enjoy watching it more than once. Even though they mention a few things that aren't perfect, overall, they seem to like the movie a lot. Kind of like when you eat a really yummy ice cream cone but get a little messy - it's still a really good ice cream cone, right? That's what this review is like."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: What is the first name of the person whose brother is married to an American woman in Los Angeles?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Lyon Gaultier is a paratrooper in the French Foreign Legion, stationed in Djibouti, North Africa. His brother, who is married to an American woman in Los Angeles, is burned alive during a drug deal gone wrong and suffers third-degree burns, dying shortly afterward. Lyon deserts his legion when he finds out they have been withholding letters from his brother's wife and ultimately refuse to let him see his dying brother. He steals a jeep and escapes through the desert, finding work on a tramp steamer headed for the U.S. Meanwhile, the Legion Commandant travels to Paris, arriving at the government Consulate, where he is told that Lyon's desertion is ranked at low importance with the LAPD, so the Commandant suggests sending two of his own men to bring Gaultier back, which is approved. Lyon arrives pennyless in New York City and is attracted to an illegal street fighting match that is being run by a New Yorker called Joshua, a man who runs fights for money. Gaultier steps forward to take part in the next fight and destroys his opponent, leaving Joshua looking astounded at what he just saw. Joshua takes Lyon to meet a person called Cynthia, also known as 'The Lady' who organizes underground fights for the rich elite and she decides to sponsor him. Figuring that this would be the best way to earn the money he needs to get to L.A., Lyon fights in a no-holds-barred bare-knuckle fights to finance the trip. Once in L.A. Lyon goes to the hospital where his brother was taken. He learns that he cannot avenge his brother's murder, as he failed to identify his killers before dying. Grief-stricken, Lyon asks the help of Joshua who tracks down his brother's widow's address. However she refuses to accept any financial aid from him, even though she obviously needs it, because she is angry with Lyon for \\"deserting\\" his brother years ago. She threatens to call the cops and Lyon has no choice but to leave. The answer is:","output":"Lyon. The person whose brother is married to an American woman in Los Angeles is Lyon Gaultier. He is a paratrooper in the French Foreign Legion. His brother was the one who was married to the American woman but died after being burned alive during a botched drug deal. Lyon learned about his brother's demise and his wife's situation when he found the letters that the legion had been withholding from him. This led him to desert the legion and make his way to the United States. He had the hope of helping his sister-in-law, who is based in Los Angeles, although she refused his financial assistance because she was upset that Lyon had 'deserted' his brother years before. Regardless, the brother in question who is married to the American woman in Los Angeles is Lyon's brother, hence the person being referred to in the question is Lyon Gaultier."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Oil prices eased below 102 a barrel Thursday but remained near highs last seen in 2008 as fighting between rebels and government forces in Libya intensified amid efforts to reach a mediated resolution to the conflict that has cut crude supplies by more than half from the OPEC nation.      A gas station attendant pumps gas Wednesday, March 2, 2011, in Portland, Ore. Oil prices rose above 102 a barrel Wednesday as fighting escalated in Libya and petroleum demand grew in the U.S. (AP Photo/Rick... (Associated Press)      By early afternoon in Europe, benchmark crude for April delivery was down 80 cents at 101.43 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract added 2.60 to settle Wednesday at 102.23, the highest settlement since Sept. 26, 2008.      In London, Brent crude for April delivery was down 88 cents to 115.47 a barrel on the ICE Futures exchange.      President Hugo Chavez has spoken with Moammar Gadhafi about creating a bloc of friendly countries to help mediate a resolution to Libya's crisis, Venezuela's information minister said Wednesday. Venezuelan officials did not say how Gadhafi had responded to the proposal.      On Thursday morning, government warplanes launched an airstrike on Brega, a port town in Libya's rebel-held east, as opposition forces, including mutinous army units, deployed around the city's strategic oil installations.      \\"Reports on a peace plan for Libya have put pressure on oil prices,\\" said analysts at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. \\"This dip in is only temporary in our view. It is doubtful that the protesters in Libya will agree to enter negotiations with Gadhafi.\\"      The International Energy Agency said Wednesday that a power struggle between supporters and opponents of Gadhafi had cut up to 1 million barrels per day of crude production, more than the group's previous estimate of as much as 750,000 barrels per day.      Traders are also factoring in the possibility that political upheaval in other oil-rich countries could pinch global crude supplies.      \\"The spread of protests into other major oil producing nations such as Oman, Algeria and especially Saudi Arabia could keep this oil market on a boil for some time to come,\\" Ritterbusch and Associates said in a report.      Analysts said sustained oil prices above 100 would eventually undermine consumer demand and threaten global economic growth.      With oil prices \\"at these elevated levels, the current global economic recovery is at significant risk of stalling,\\" said Richard Soultanian of NUS Consulting.      The U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization said Thursday that global food prices reached new highs in February _ rising for the eighth consecutive month _ while warning that oil price spikes could provoke further increases.      In other Nymex trading in April contracts, heating oil fell 1.08 cents to 3.0469 a gallon and gasoline fell 2.62 cents to 3.0033 a gallon. Natural gas futures were up 1.6 cents at 3.834 per 1,000 cubic feet.      ___      Alex Kennedy in Singapore contributed to this report. ||||| Libya's rebel leaders have ruled out any attempt by Hugo Chávez to broker a truce between them and Muammar Gaddafi, whom they insist must leave the country.      \\"No one has told us a thing about it and we are not interested anyway,\\" said the spokesman of the national committee in Benghazi, Abdul Hafif Goga. \\"We will never negotiate with him.\\"      The rebel leadership said the international community had yet to inform them of any initiative from the Venezuelan president, who reportedly contacted the embattled Libyan leader earlier this week in a bid to enter the fortnight-long violent standoff.      \\"Talk of peace is far too late,\\" said a second member of the organising committee, Salwa Bogheiga. \\"A lot of people have died and there is no one to negotiate with. They lost that right when they started killing people on 17 February.\\"      The nascent rebel committee in Benghazi and the military leadership that jointly run the eastern side of the country insist that they are now too committed to consider any sort of ceasefire. They say that Gaddafi would use it to re-organise his loyalist troops for a major assault on rebel-held cities.      Details of what Chávez proposed to Gaddafi are scant. The Arab League has also been told of the Venezuelan leader's offer but is similarly in the dark about what it entails.      In Tripoli, the Libyan government said it accepted the Venezuelan offer.      The information minister, Andres Izarra, said the Arab League had shown interest in Chavez's proposal to send an international commission to talk with both sides in Libya.      Reports that Chavez's proposal was being taken seriously by Arab leaders has pushed down oil prices.      In Benghazi, Khalid Alsahly, a lawyer who is acting as liaison officer between the military and civilian councils, said: \\"The starting point of our revolution is peaceful resistance, and we were peaceful until Gaddafi's people started using guns and fire on us.      \\"Now we are training and, yes, we will march to Tripoli if necessary. We have a very great number of young men who are being trained, and we have the resolve.      \\"They are full of desire to change the Gaddafi regime and we will march on Tripoli because we have the will to fight, and his people do not. We will move when we are ready.\\" |||||","output":"The article talks about oil prices going a little below 102 per barrel because of the ongoing fighting in Libya. The fighting affects how much oil is produced and supplied from the country. The president of Venezuela wants to help solve the problem in Libya, but the people fighting against the Libyan leader might not want to negotiate. High oil prices can make it hard for the world economy to grow and can even increase the prices of food.

The statement discusses the transition from the Pickelhaube to the Stahlhelm during World War I, which is not relevant to determining the size of a World War 2 helmet. To determine the size needed for a German World War 2 helmet, you should follow these steps: 1. Measure your head: Use a flexible measuring tape to measure the circumference of your head. Place the tape just above your eyebrows and ears, roughly 1 inch (2.54 cm) above, to ensure it covers the widest part of your head. Record the measurement in centimeters. 2. Consult a sizing chart: Many reproductions of German World War 2 helmets will provide a sizing chart (often called \\"liner size chart\\") that matches head circumference measurements to helmet sizes. These sizes typically range from 54, 55,... up to 66, 67, etc. Some may include a 'shell size' which dictates the overall external size or weight of the helmet; these sizes are typically represented by letters like \\"EF\\" or \\"Q.\\" Refer to the chart to find the size that corresponds to your measurement. Sizes may vary slightly between manufacturers, so always consult the chart provided for the specific helmet you are considering. 3. Try on the helmet (if possible): Whenever possible, try on the helmet to ensure a proper fit. Your forehead should be covered, but the helmet should not rest too low on your brow, obstructing your vision. There should be no pressure points, and the liner should provide a snug, even fit around your head. If a helmet is not available to try on, use the sizing chart as your primary guide. 4. Adjust the liner if needed: Many original and reproduction German World War 2 helmets have adjustable liners. If your helmet feels too tight or too loose, you may be able to adjust the liner straps for a better fit. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions to make these adjustments safely. By following these steps, you should be able to find the appropriate size for a German World War 2 helmet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Help as much as you can. I have a new situation: Two farms used AM fungi for the plants. Brown farm also decided to grow cover crops on those parcels of land to help mycorrhizal growth. Orange farm didn't grow cover crops.  But I can use this background: Since AM fungi are biotrophic, they are dependent on plants for the growth of their hyphal networks. Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield.

Pick the feces up and throw into a proper receptacle. Explanation: The question is about curbing your dog, i.e., cleaning up after your dog when it defecates in public. The correct approach is to wait until the dog has finished defecating and then use a plastic bag as a glove to pick up the feces and dispose of it in a proper receptacle. Option (a) suggests wearing the plastic bag before the dog defecates, which is incorrect because you would be unable to accurately predict when and where the dog will defecate, potentially interfering with the action and making the process less effective and more challenging."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The expansion of the Catalan territory was a part of the larger process known as the Reconquista, which was the effort by Christian kingdoms in the Iberian Peninsula to reclaim territories from Muslim rule. In this context, various Catalan counts and rulers embarked on a series of military and diplomatic campaigns to extend their control over areas in the North-East region of the Iberian Peninsula. During the 11th century, the counts of Barcelona and other Catalan nobles started to push their frontiers towards the south, against the Muslim territories, gradually gaining control over the lands up to the Ebro River. The capture of important cities such as Tarragona, Lleida, and Tortosa in the late 11th and early 12th centuries contributed significantly to the consolidation of Catalan power in the region. This territorial expansion continued through the 12th century as Catalan rulers extended and consolidated their control in areas north of the Ebro River, effectively establishing their sovereignty in the region. By the end of the 12th century, the County of Barcelona had effectively evolved into the Principality of Catalonia, which, together with the Kingdom of Aragon, formed the Crown of Aragon, setting the stage for further expansions in the 13th century. In the 13th century, the Crown of Aragon, under King James I, continued its expansionist policies by conquering the Kingdom of Valencia and the Balearic Islands. As a result, the Crown of Aragon emerged as a significant power in the Mediterranean, with influential territories in modern-day Spain, France, and Italy. In conclusion, the statement in question correctly answers the query about the period when the Catalan rulers expanded their territory to the north of the Ebro River. This expansion took place during the 11th and 12th centuries as a part of the larger Reconquista movement."},{"instruction":"Q:Information:  - The Italian Army (Italian: Esercito Italiano; EI) is the land defence force of the Italian Armed Forces of the Italian Republic.

Sprout the tubers: First, you need tiny baby plants called \\"sprouts\\" to grow from the oca tubers. To do this, place your tubers in a bright spot, but not in direct sunlight. After a few weeks, little sprouts will pop out! 2. Prepare the soil: While waiting for the tubers to sprout, get your garden ready. Oca plants like soft, fluffy soil so they can stretch out as they grow. Ask a grown-up to help you mix compost or aged manure into your garden's soil. This will give the oca plants yummy food to eat while they're growing. 3. Plant the sprouted tubers: When the sprouts are about 1 inch (2.5 cm) long, it's time to plant them. Ask your grown-up to help you dig little holes about 4 inches (10 cm) deep and at least 3 feet (1 m) apart. Gently place a sprouted tuber in each hole, with the sprout pointing upwards. Then cover them up with soil. 4. Water and care: Oca plants need water to grow big and strong! Make sure you water them gently, keeping the soil moist but not too wet. Ask your grown-up to help you remove any weeds so your oca plants have room to grow. 5. Harvest: In about 6 months, the oca plants will be ready to harvest! That's when you can dig up the tubers.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What financial institute did the man who owned Chartwell suffer heavy losses investing in?, using the article: In the opinion of Robin Fedden, a diplomat, and later Deputy General Secretary of the National Trust and author of the Trust's first guidebook for Chartwell, the house became \\"the most important country house in Europe\\". A stream of friends, colleagues, disgruntled civil servants and concerned military officers came to the house to provide information to support Churchill's struggle against appeasement. At Chartwell, he developed what Fedden calls, his own \\"little Foreign Office ... the hub of resistance\\". The Chartwell visitors' book, meticulously maintained from 1922, records some 780 house guests, not all of them friends, but all grist to Churchill's mill. An example of the latter was Sir Maurice Hankey, Clerk of the Privy Council, who was Churchill's guest for dinner in April 1936. Hankey subsequently wrote, \\"I do not usually make a note of private conversations but some points arose which gave an indication of the line which Mr Churchill is likely to take in forthcoming debates (on munitions and supply) in Parliament\\". A week later, Reginald Leeper, a senior Foreign Office official and confident of Robert Vansittart, visited Churchill to convey their views on the need to use the League of Nations to counter German aggression. Vansittart wrote, \\"there is no time to lose. There is indeed a great danger that we shall be too late\\".Churchill also recorded visits to Chartwell by two more of his most important suppliers of confidential governmental information, Desmond Morton and Ralph Wigram, information which he used to \\"form and fortify my opinion about the Hitler Movement\\". Chartwell was also the scene of more direct attempts to prepare Britain for the coming conflict; in October 1939, when reappointed First Lord of the Admiralty on the outbreak of war, Churchill suggested an improvement for anti-aircraft shells; \\"Such shells could be filled with zinc ethyl which catches fire spontaneously ... A fraction of an ounce was demonstrated at Chartwell last summer\\".In 1938, Churchill, beset by financial concerns,..., what would be the answer ? The answer to this question is:","output":"Churchill's financial woes were related to his investments in the stock market, particularly during the late 1920s and 1930s. While the specific financial institution in which he suffered heavy losses is not directly mentioned in the provided article, it's important to note that during this time period, the global economy experienced significant turmoil, starting with the Wall Street Crash of 1929 in the United States. As a result of the Great Depression, many banks and financial institutions faced collapse or heavy losses, directly impacting investors like Churchill. The information in the article does touch on Churchill's financial concerns, stating that in 1938, he was beset by financial concerns, but it does not explicitly give the name of the financial institution associated with his losses at Chartwell."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The problem statement is asking us to find the perimeter of a rectangular room, given the increase and decrease in the area when the dimensions are modified. We have: - Length of the room: L - Breadth of the room: B - Increased length: L + 1 - Increased breadth: B + 1 - Decreased breadth: B - 1 Step 2: Set up the equations based on the given information. We are given two situations: 1. When both length and breadth are increased by 1 meter, the area is increased by 21 sq. meters. 2. When the length is increased by 1 meter and the breadth is decreased by 1 meter, the area is decreased by 5 sq. meters. Let's set up two equations using these conditions: Equation 1: (L + 1)(B + 1) = LB + 21 Equation 2: (L + 1)(B - 1) = LB - 5 Step 3: Simplify and solve the equations for L and B. Now, we'll expand and simplify the two equations: Equation 1: LB + L + B + 1 = LB + 21 Equation 2: LB - L + B - 1 = LB - 5 Simplify the equations by removing the common term LB: Equation 1: L + B + 1 = 21 Equation 2: - L + B - 1 = -5 Now, add Equation 1 and Equation 2: 2B = 16 Now, we can find B by dividing both sides by 2: B = 8 Now that we have the value of B, we can substitute it into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to find L. Let's use Equation 1: L + 8 + 1 = 21 L = 21 - 8 - 1 L = 12 Step 4: Calculate the perimeter of the rectangular room. Now that we have the length and breadth of the room, we can find the perimeter. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Breadth) Perimeter = 2 * (12 + 8) Perimeter = 2 * 20 Perimeter = 40 meters Output: The perimeter of the rectangular floor is 40 meters."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, to keep your vacuum cleaner functioning effectively for a long time, periodic cleaning and maintenance are necessary. Many people are unaware of the right way to clean their vacuum cleaner, so we've prepared a step-by-step guide to help you with this crucial task. Follow the instructions below to ensure the longevity and optimal performance of your vacuum cleaner. Step 1: Read the Vacuum's Instructions Before beginning any maintenance or cleaning process, it's crucial to consult the user manual or the manufacturer's instructions. These instructions often contain specific recommendations and steps for the proper care and maintenance of the vacuum cleaner model you own. If you no longer have the user manual, you can often find a copy online by searching for the make and model of your vacuum cleaner. Step 2: Unplug the Vacuum Cleaner To ensure your safety and avoid any electrical hazards, turn off the vacuum cleaner and unplug it from the power outlet. This is an essential first step to avoid any accidents during the cleaning process. Step 3: Disassemble the Vacuum Cleaner Start by disassembling the vacuum cleaner, following the instructions found in the user manual. You will likely need to remove the canister, hose, brush, and filter for thorough cleaning. Having these components separated makes it more manageable to clean each part individually and efficiently. Step 4: Empty the Canister Empty the dust canister or bag by disposing of its contents in the trash. Check the canister or bag for any signs of wear or damage, as it may need replacement if it has tears or other signs of wear.

This step will remove dust and dirt buildup, ensuring that your vacuum cleaner operates efficiently and prevents dust from re-entering the air. Step 6: Clean the Filter Filters play an essential role in maintaining a vacuum cleaner's efficiency and preventing dust from circulating back into the air. Most vacuum cleaners come with washable filters, but always check the manufacturer's instructions before cleaning. Rinse the filter under warm water and gently scrub it using a brush until it's clean. Do not use soap or detergents as these may damage the filter. Step 7: Allow Everything to Dry After washing the filter, place all disassembled components in a warm, well-ventilated area to dry completely for at least 24 hours. It's essential to ensure that all parts are dry before reassembling the vacuum cleaner, as moisture can damage the electrical components and hinder the vacuum's performance. Conclusion: A clean and well-maintained vacuum cleaner will function more efficiently and last longer, saving you money on replacements and providing improved cleaning results. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can extend the life of your vacuum cleaner and maintain optimal performance. Regularly scheduled maintenance and proper care will ensure that your vacuum cleaner remains a valuable asset in keeping your home clean and hygienic."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Proper food storage: By storing bread in a clean and sealed container or plastic bag, you can prevent it from being exposed to mold spores floating in the air. Keeping the storage area cool and dry can also help prevent mold growth, as mold thrives in warm, humid conditions. 2. Regular cleaning of kitchen surfaces and countertops: Regularly cleaning and sanitizing kitchen surfaces can help remove traces of mold spores and other potential contaminants. By maintaining a clean environment, you minimize the opportunities for mold spores to land on the bread. 3. Promptly addressing moisture issues: Mold requires moisture to grow. By quickly addressing any water leaks or condensation issues in your home, you can limit the available environments for mold spores to thrive. 4. Proper ventilation: Ensuring that your home has adequate ventilation can help reduce humidity levels and make it more difficult for mold to grow. By properly ventilating your living spaces, you also lower the number of mold spores floating in the air, which decreases the chances of them landing on your bread. 5. Air filtration and purification: Using air filters or purifiers can help capture and remove mold spores, bacteria, and other airborne particles from your indoor environment. This can significantly reduce the number of mold spores present in the air, thus further decreasing the likelihood of mold contamination on your bread. In summary, practicing good hygiene by implementing the methods mentioned above can significantly lower the chances of mold spores landing on your bread. This, in turn, leads to a decreased risk of mold growth and improved food safety."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Here are the options: Choose your answer from: i. yes ii. it is not possible to tell iii. no Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"Step 1: Analyze the premise. The premise states \\"um-hum yeah well any of the guys that were ground  yes yeah i can imagine\\", which is not clear at all. However, there is a mention of being able to imagine something about the guys on the ground. Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis. The hypothesis states \\"I can imagine and predict what any of those guys on the ground will do.\\" This is clearer than the premise and suggests the ability to predict the actions of the people mentioned. Step 3: Compare the premise and hypothesis. Comparing the two expressions, there is an overlap in the concept of imagining something about the guys on the ground. However, the hypothesis is more specific and includes a mention of predicting their actions. Step 4: Evaluate if the premise leads to the hypothesis. Although the premise and hypothesis share a similar theme of imagining something about the people on the ground, the premise is not clear and specific enough to justify the more specific and precise claim made in the hypothesis.

Paragraph: Literary career During the war Camus joined the French Resistance cell Combat, which published an underground newspaper of the same name. This group worked against the Nazis, and in it Camus assumed the nom de guerre Beauchard. Camus became the paper's editor in 1943. He first met Sartre at the dress rehearsal of Sartre's play, The Flies, in June 1943. When the Ailies liberated Paris in August 1944, Camus witnessed and reported the last of the fighting. Soon after the event on 6 August 1945, he was one of the few French editors to publicly express opposition and disgust to the United States' dropping the atomic bomb in Hiroshima. He resigned from Combat in 1947 when it became a commercial paper. After the war, Camus began frequenting the Cafe de Flore on the Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris with Sartre and others. He also toured the United States to lecture about French thought. Although he leaned left, politically, his strong criticisms of Communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the Communist parties and eventually alienated Sartre. In 1949, his tuberculosis returned, whereupon he lived in seclusion for two years. In 1951, he published The Rebel, a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which expressed his rejection of communism. Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France, the book brought about the final split with Sartre. The dour reception depressed Camus; he began to translate plays. Camus's first significant contribution to philosophy was his idea of the absurd. He saw it as the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither, which he expressed in The Myth of Sisyphus and incorporated into many of his other works, such as The Stranger and The Plague. Despite his split from his \\"study partner\\", Sartre, Camus was still categorized as an Existentialist. He specifically rejected that label in his essay \\"Enigma\\" and elsewhere.

They are those parts of the former British Empire that have not chosen independence or have voted to remain British territories. Most of the inhabited territories are internally self-governing, with the UK retaining responsibility for defence and foreign relations. The rest are either uninhabited or have a transitory population of military or scientific personnel. They share the British monarch (Elizabeth II) as head of state.  - Acts of Parliament, also called primary legislation, are statutes passed by a parliament (legislature). Act of the Oireachtas is an equivalent term used in the Republic of Ireland where the legislature is commonly known by its Irish name, . It is also comparable to an Act of Congress in the United States.  - In England and Wales, a magistrates' court is a lower court, where almost all criminal proceedings start. Some civil matters are also decided here, notably family proceedings. They have been streamlined to deliver justice swiftly. In 2015 there were roughly 330 magistrates' courts in England and Wales, though the Government was considering closing up to 57 of these. The jurisdiction of magistrates' courts and rules governing them are set out in the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980.  - The Architects Act 1997 ( c. 22 ) is the consolidating Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for the keeping and publishing of the statutory Register of Architects by the Architects Registration Board . It has the long title : An Act to consolidate the enactments relating to architects . It consolidated two Acts of the 1930s as later amended both by primary legislation and by Orders in Council implementing the EC directive on architects providing for the recognition of architects qualified in other EC states , and the changes which had been made by Part III of the Housing Grants , Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 .  - The Parliament of the United Kingdom, commonly known as the UK Parliament or British Parliament, is the supreme legislative body in the United Kingdom, British Crown dependencies and British overseas territories. It alone possesses legislative supremacy and thereby ultimate power over all other political bodies in the UK and its territories. Its head is the Sovereign of the United Kingdom (currently Queen Elizabeth II) and its seat is the Palace of Westminster in the City of Westminster, London.  - The City of Westminster is an Inner London borough which also holds city status. It occupies much of the central area of Greater London including most of the West End. It is to the west of and adjoining the ancient City of London, directly to the east of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, and its southern boundary is the River Thames. It was created with the 1965 establishment of Greater London. Upon creation, Westminster was awarded city status, which had been previously held by the smaller Metropolitan Borough of Westminster.  - Under an Act passed by the UK Parliament in 1931, there was established an Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom (ARCUK), referred to in the Act as \\"the Council\\". The constitution of the Council was prescribed by the First Schedule to the Act. The Act made the Council a body corporate by the name Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom.

The originating Act contained ancillary provisions for entering an architects name in the register and removing a name from it which later legislation has amended. The 1931 Act gave it the name the Register of Registered Architects, but by an Act of 1938 the name was changed to the Register of Architects.   - A consolidated fund or the consolidated revenue fund is a term used in many countries with political systems derived from the Westminster system to describe the main bank account of the government.   - The Palace of Westminster is the meeting place of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, the two houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

Question 1: It is very challenging to encompass SNMP in a active measurement platform. Why? Can you also give me reference in literature that proves why? Question 2: Why do you think syndicating content is important? Also share a few platforms that you follow. Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Question 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. They address two separate topics. I will provide detailed answers for both questions. Question 1: Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a standard protocol used to exchange information between network devices, allowing administrators to monitor and manage these devices. Integrating SNMP into an active measurement platform can be challenging for several reasons: 1. Scope and Complexity: SNMP is a complex protocol that covers various aspects of network management, from device configuration to performance metrics. In an active measurement platform, multiple protocols and tools need to be assimilated to efficiently monitor different types of network devices and their underlying metrics. SNMP's complexity may pose a challenge in such integration. 2. Protocol Variations: SNMP comes in several versions, such as SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, and SNMPv3, each with its own specifications and features. Implementing SNMP support in an active measurement platform requires accommodating these variations, which can be challenging. 3. Security Issues: SNMP, especially in its earlier versions, has notable security vulnerabilities, including weak authentication and authorization mechanisms. Incorporating SNMP into an active measurement platform requires addressing these security concerns to protect the monitored devices and the collected data. 4. Scalability: Network monitoring platforms often need to support a large number of devices and frequent monitoring intervals. SNMP's polling-based approach may lead to congestion and inefficient consumption of network resources in large-scale deployments. A reference in literature that elaborates on the challenges of integrating SNMP into an active measurement platform is \\"SNMP at the edge: taking the challenges\\" by Mark Burgess (2002), which can be found here: https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/lisa02/tech/Burgess.pdf. Question 2: Syndicating content is important for several reasons: 1. Increased Exposure: Content syndication allows your content to reach a wider audience, extending its reach beyond your website or social media channels. This increased exposure ultimately leads to higher traffic and greater visibility for your brand. 2. SEO Benefits: Syndicating content on reputable platforms can contribute to improved search engine rankings. These platforms create credible backlinks to your original content, signaling search engines that your content is valuable and trustworthy. 3. Establishing Authority: Building relationships with reputable content syndication platforms showcases your content alongside other established industry leaders. This association improves your credibility and authority in your field. 4. Time and Resource Efficiency: Creating quality content requires significant time and resources. By syndicating your content, you can make better use of your existing content and increase its impact without having to create more new material. A few popular content syndication platforms include: 1. Medium (https://medium.com/): A blogging platform that allows you to republish content, reaching a wider audience. 2. Reddit (https://www.reddit.com/): A social networking and discussion forum where you can share links to your content. 3. Business2Community (https://www.business2community.com/): A platform for industry professionals to contribute their expertise and knowledge through articles and blog posts. 4. Outbrain (https://www.outbrain.com/): A content promotion platform that displays your content as \\"recommended\\" articles on other websites, driving traffic back to your site. These platforms cater to different subjects, industries, and content formats, allowing you to expand your content's reach to diverse audiences."},{"instruction":"It was a good feast.

Clarke, whose previous best finish was runner-up in 1997, lifted the coveted Claret Jug at his 21st attempt -- breaking the record of the tournament's previous longest wait, the 15-try streak that Zimbabwean Nick Price snapped in 1994.  OPTIONS: - Americans, seeking his first major title, drove out of bounds at the 14th and his double-bogey there handed Clarke a four-shot buffer. - British Open, seeking his first major title, drove out of bounds at the 14th and his double-bogey there handed Clarke a four-shot buffer. - CNN, seeking his first major title, drove out of bounds at the 14th and his double-bogey there handed Clarke a four-shot buffer. - Claret Jug, seeking his first major title, drove out of bounds at the 14th and his double-bogey there handed Clarke a four-shot buffer. - Clarke, seeking his first major title, drove out of bounds at the 14th and his double-bogey there handed Clarke a four-shot buffer. - Darren Clarke, seeking his first major title, drove out of bounds at the 14th and his double-bogey there handed Clarke a four-shot buffer. - Dustin Johnson, seeking his first major title, drove out of bounds at the 14th and his double-bogey there handed Clarke a four-shot buffer. - England, seeking his first major title, drove out of bounds at the 14th and his double-bogey there handed Clarke a four-shot buffer. - Nick Price, seeking his first major title, drove out of bounds at the 14th and his double-bogey there handed Clarke a four-shot buffer. - Northern Ireland, seeking his first major title, drove out of bounds at the 14th and his double-bogey there handed Clarke a four-shot buffer. - Phil Mickelson, seeking his first major title, drove out of bounds at the 14th and his double-bogey there handed Clarke a four-shot buffer. - Royal St. George's, seeking his first major title, drove out of bounds at the 14th and his double-bogey there handed Clarke a four-shot buffer. - Zimbabwean, seeking his first major title, drove out of bounds at the 14th and his double-bogey there handed Clarke a four-shot buffer.","output":"Given the context of the story, the last sentence should be related to the main character (Darren Clarke) or one of his contenders. Here, the mention of driving out of bounds, double-bogey, and handing Clarke a four-shot buffer seems to be crucial to the story. However, it's known from the story that Clarke is the winner, so he cannot be seeking his first major title in the same event. Therefore, the competitors (Americans Phil Mickelson and Dustin Johnson) should be the subjects of the sentence. Among the provided options, this is relevant only to these two. Therefore, the most suitable and logical end to this story should be: \\"Dustin Johnson, seeking his first major title, drove out of bounds at the 14th and his double-bogey there handed Clarke a four-shot buffer.\\"  The choice of Dustin Johnson over Phil Mickelson is arbitrary since both are mentioned as rivals in the story, and a similar incident could happen to either of them. However, Johnson is mentioned later in the presented story part, which may hint that he was the last one to lose his chance, thus justifying this choice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

That's why it's so disturbing how much heat European currency and sovereign debt speculators are getting these days.      Even the U.S. has climbed aboard the bandwagon now.      Reports of a U.S. Justice Department investigation into Soros Fund Management, SAC, and Greenlight Capital short positions against the euro broke last week.      Yet now the speculator clamp down is evolving into something completely terrifying. Apparently, it could now be considered collusion if you simply share economic opinions over dinner:      WSJ:      The Journal article disclosed that the big euro bets were emerging amid gatherings including an \\"idea dinner\\" involving a number of hedge funds including SAC, Greenlight and Soros, where a trader argued that the euro is likely to fall to \\"parity,\\" or equal to, against the dollar on an exchange basis. The euro currently trades at 1.3609. One of the questions investigators are likely to examine is whether such information-sharing constitutes collusion, the people say.      ...      At one such gathering, a dinner on Feb. 8 at a Manhattan restaurant, an SAC portfolio manager said he believed the euro could fall to a level equal to that of the dollar and urged other traders to \\"short,\\" or bet against, the euro as his firm had, according to people at the dinner. The size of the bets against the euro is unclear.      In a research note issued to hundreds of hedge-fund clients shortly after the dinner, the research boutique that hosted the event summed up the SAC manager's argument without mentioning his name. [But attributing it to an unnamed third party source, 'a presenter', which is standard practice]      One of the most dangerous misconceptions used to restrict economic freedoms is that opinions have more weight than fundamentals. Should we arrest people for threatening 'economic stability' if they argue against a particular stimulus bill or government and then collectively vote against it?      Because that's all euro-shorts are doing. Whoever thinks that euro speculators are pushing the euro to unfairly low levels has an opportunity to vote against them any day of the week in the currency markets. So let's not forget that a truly viable currency can carry the weight of open criticism, just like a strong nation or value-system can. Else traders better brush up on their Orwellian double speak.      See the latest EUR-USD movements here. ||||| The Justice Department has launched an investigation into whether hedge funds might have banded together to drive down the value of the euro, people familiar with the matter say.      In a letter last week, the department has asked hedge funds including SAC Capital Advisors LP, Greenlight Capital Inc., Soros Fund Management LLC and Paulson & Co. to retain trading records and emails relating to the euro, say people who have seen the letter.

This crackdown on speculators is seen as an indicator of potential trouble for the European financial system.

Answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: The origins of blues are not unlike the origins of life. For many years it was recorded only by memory, and relayed only live, and in person. The blues were born in the North Mississippi Delta following the Civil War. Influenced by African roots, field hollers , ballads, church music and rhythmic dance tunes called jump-ups evolved into a music for a singer who would engage in call-and-response with his guitar. He would sing a line, and the guitar would answer.       From the crossroads of Highways 61 and 49, and the platform of the Clarksdale Railway Station, the blues headed north to Beale Street in Memphis. The blues have strongly influenced almost all popular music including jazz, country, and rock and roll and continue to help shape music worldwide. Bad luck and trouble are always present in the Blues. Relentless rhythms repeat the chants of sorrow, and the pity of a lost soul many times over.       The blues form was first popularized about 1911-14 by the black composer W.C. Handy. However, the poetic and musical form of the blues first crystallized  around 1910 and gained popularity through the publication of Handy's Memphis Blues(1912) and St.Louis Blues(1914). Instrumental blues had been recorded as early as 1913. During the twenties, the blues became a national craze. Mamie Smith recorded the first vocal blues song, Crazy Blues in 1920.       In the early 1960s, the urban bluesmen were \\"discovered\\" by young white American and European musicians. Many blues-based bands brought the blues to young white audiences. Since the sixties, rock has undergone several blues revivals. Some rock guitarists have used the blues as a foundation for offshoot   styles. The latest generation of blues players like Robert Cray and the late Stevie Ray Vaughan, gracing   the blues tradition with their incredible technicality , have drawn a new generation listeners to the blues.

Given the question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Which of the following people has a book of the Bible named after them: Mary, Luke or Jesus?\\" is in \\"Mary's complete sinlessness and concomitant exemption from any taint from the first moment of her existence was a doctrine familiar to Greek theologians of Byzantium. Beginning with St. Gregory Nazianzen, his explanation of the \\"purification\\" of Jesus and Mary at the circumcision (Luke 2:22) prompted him to consider the primary meaning of \\"purification\\" in Christology (and by extension in Mariology) to refer to a perfectly sinless nature that manifested itself in glory in a moment of grace (e.g., Jesus at his Baptism). St. Gregory Nazianzen designated Mary as \\"prokathartheisa (prepurified).\\" Gregory likely attempted to solve the riddle of the Purification of Jesus and Mary in the Temple through considering the human natures of Jesus and Mary as equally holy and therefore both purified in this manner of grace and glory. Gregory's doctrines surrounding Mary's purification were likely related to the burgeoning commemoration of the Mother of God in and around Constantinople very close to the date of Christmas. Nazianzen's title of Mary at the Annunciation as \\"prepurified\\" was subsequently adopted by all theologians interested in his Mariology to justify the Byzantine equivalent of the Immaculate Conception. This is especially apparent in the Fathers St. Sophronios of Jerusalem and St. John Damascene, who will be treated below in this article at the section on Church Fathers. About the time of Damascene, the public celebration of the \\"Conception of St. Ann [i.e., of the Theotokos in her womb]\\" was becoming popular. After this period, the \\"purification\\" of the perfect natures of Jesus and Mary would not only mean moments of grace and glory at the Incarnation and Baptism and other public Byzantine liturgical feasts, but purification was eventually associated with the feast of Mary's very conception (along with her Presentation in the Temple as a toddler) by Orthodox authors of the 2nd millennium (e.g., St. Nicholas Cabasilas and Joseph Bryennius).\\".

Article:","output":"Title: Tragic Accident on Set of 'The Walking Dead' Claims Life of Stuntman John Bernecker The entertainment industry is mourning the loss of talented stuntman John Bernecker, who sadly passed away after a devastating fall on the set of the hit TV show, 'The Walking Dead.' The accident, which occurred during the filming of season 8, has shaken the show's cast and crew, as well as the wider community of actors and professionals working in the world of television and film. John Bernecker, 33, was described as a cherished and highly skilled member of the show's production team. He was an experienced stunt performer and coordinator, who had amassed an impressive body of work over the course of his career. His credits include popular films such as 'Get Out,' 'Logan,' 'Black Panther,' and 'The Fate of the Furious,' as well as numerous television series, including 'The Vampire Diaries,' 'Scream Queens,' and 'Into the Badlands,' among others. Bernecker's untimely passing has left a void in the stunt community, with many colleagues sharing their heartfelt condolences and tributes in his memory. The tragic accident occurred on July 12, 2017, when Bernecker was performing a stunt that involved a 22-foot fall from a balcony. It was reported that he missed the safety cushion by just a few inches, sustaining severe head injuries from impact with the concrete floor. Despite being rushed to Atlanta Medical Centre, he succumbed to his injuries the following day, leaving behind an industry in shock. After news of the accident broke, production of the eighth season was halted temporarily to allow for an investigation into the incident. As a result, the show's producers, Stalwart Films, were cited by the US Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) with a \\"serious\\" violation and fined 12,675. This fine amounts to the maximum penalty that can be imposed by the agency for a single violation. OSHA found that the company's failure to provide adequate protection to Bernecker during the stunt amounted to the violation of workplace safety requirements, which ultimately led to his death. The accident on the set of 'The Walking Dead' sparked urgent discussions about safety measures within the entertainment industry, particularly in relation to stunt performers. While many professionals in the field have expressed the need for constant vigilance in ensuring a safe work environment and minimizing risks, the unpredictable nature of stunt work means that occasional accidents still occur. The show, its cast, and the entire industry have been forced to confront the stark reality and potential dangers that stunt performers face in their line of work. In memory of John Bernecker, both the cast and crew of 'The Walking Dead' dedicated the season 8 premiere to his lasting legacy. A heartfelt message that accompanied the episode read, \\"In loving memory of our friend and colleague John Bernecker, who shared his passion for storytelling with all of us. He will be greatly missed.\\" Bernecker's passing has underscored the vital importance of upholding stringent safety standards within the entertainment industry, as well as acknowledging and honoring the immense contributions of stunt performers and coordinators around the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It's the kind of things that actors love--it's kind of like a workshop or a play because it mostly consists of tight focusing on the actors acting... acting angry, tense, scared, conversing, scheming, planning--giving the performers a lot of free range to really ham it all up. A trio of crooks, one leader, one goon, one brother, come up with a big heist scheme... and a monkey wrench is thrown into the works. To top things off, there's a bit of a \\"fender-bender\\" and one of the crooks in flung through the back of the windshield. The cops are on their tail and they stumble into a bar named poetically (and leadenly) \\"Dino's Last Chance.\\" Spacey, as a director, tries to keep the focus on the actors' performances and delivery of dialouge. He pans over to a bright passion-red cigarette ad of a smoking and smoldering Bogart. And he keeps all the violence off-screen, really. I think that was a mistake. Focusing on the intensity and gruesome violent scenes would have given the movie some edge. The problem with the movie is that it moves too slow and suffers from miscasting in almost every role. Matt Dillon (\\"Drugstore Cowboy\\" and \\"Wild Things\\") seems too young and too idealistic to be the leader of this gang. Gary Sinese seems to brooding and deep in thought to be a spineless tag-along with these guys and Joe Mantaga is effective as the traditional routine foul-swearing mad-dog police lieutenant who's all thumbs, but he isn't given anything to really do here. William Fischter is the only actor who is believable in his role as a brainless grunt who just wants to spill blood. And the crooks are in a tense situation where they either go to jail or they try to think of some way out of this. Spacey lacks the ability to create a lot of tension and keep it going. The characters are mostly chatting away, trying to think of a plan... and they're to calm and too articulate. There's even a scene where the crooks are playing pool with a whole swarm of armed cops right outside, ready to strike. At one point, one of the crooks even call the police who are right outside the bar. Oh brother. Oh bother. These cops are going to either blow them away or going to lock them up. Shouldn't the holed-up crooks be a little scared, a little uneasy? Meanwhile, all the real action is happening inside. Someone whips out a gun, a baseball bat, which leads to an ugly confrontation off-screen and there's one more casualty that happens that's... well, kinda sad. But... Faye Dunaway also should have spent more time with a dialect coach, improving on her New Orleans accent. Skeet Ullrich is fine in a smaller part. A cop listening in reaches for a pack of matches at the absolute worst time is a nice look. And so is a scene where someone goes right through the rear windshield.  The dialouge is obviously trying to go for a David Mamet approach and it's as profane, but never as realistic or as insightful. The movie feels like too much of what it really is... a really low-budget movie with an actor behind the camera for the first time directing other actors from a script that's \\"not bad, but needs a few more re-writes.\\" Spacey shows he's not a terrible director, but he lacks a sort of feel for \\"shaping a movie\\" and it feels like he's just filming actors act. These actors are all talented and could work with the material, but they all feel out of place. As I said before, the movie really suffers from miscasting.  I don't mean that the wrong actors were cast. I think they found just the right cast, but placed them in all the wrong roles. I think switching some of the roles would've helped immensely. Having veteran mob actor Joe Mantagna play the leader of the pack, Gary Sinese as the angry police lieutenant outside on his bullhorn giving orders and barking at his troops, keeping Fischter in his \\"bloodthirsty goon\\" part and Matt Dillion as the sacrificial lamb. That would have been a big improvement. When some actors direct, it works. They can even win Oscars for it. But a lot of the time, when actors direct, they have a tendency to just focus on the performances. Just shoot the actors acting. Sometimes it works... but they need a good showcase for it. An excuse for it. Hostage situations are all pretty much the same in real life just like coming-of-age stories so it's only natural that movies about them will go from point A to point B as well. There are a few really great entries into this genre.' Spacey himself appeared in a similar movie about hostage situations: \\"The Negotiator.\\" This certainly won't become a cult classic, let alone one of AFI's 100. Still, it does have a few nice moments and personal touches, but in the end, it's instantly forgettable and the kind of movie that would play best on regular TV. It's just not worth going out of your way to see. I give a 3 out of 10.  Spacey's other directorial credit, \\"Beyond The Sea\\" was reportedly a better effort. Hmmm... maybe it's true.

You might even need to leave your home right away. So you are supposed to plan for the bad situations before the disaster comes. Here are some suggestions: First, have a family meeting. Plan a way to get your family members together if they can't find each other after the disaster. Choose two places for everyone to go to if it isn't safe to return home. The first should be near your house. You can go there in an emergency  like a fire. The second meeting place should be outside your neighborhood. Next, choose a person outside your area who can help your family get in touch with each other. After a disaster, it is often easier to communicate over a long-distance call than a local one. The person can pass messages between your family members. Then, get a family disaster _ ready. It should include things your family needs. It can help you survive   at least for three days like bread, water, medicine and things like that. Put them in a bag so you can carry it if you leave in a hurry. When doing it, remember that different people have different needs.  Include special things necessary for elderly or young members of your family. Finally, practice your emergency plan, and update   it as necessary. You may not be able to stop disasters, but with a little planning you can be helped.

Write an article based on this summary: Authorities in California have lifted an evacuation order for some 180,000 people who live below the highest dam in the US, as fear of spillage receded.","output":"Title: California's Highest Dam Avoids Crisis: Evacuation Order Lifted for 180,000 Residents Introduction California authorities have recently lifted an evacuation order for approximately 180,000 people residing below the highest dam in the United States. The situation, which caused widespread concern due to the fear of spillage, has now been deemed under control, prompting residents to return to their homes. (Step 1: Begin the article with an introduction that highlights the main points to be discussed) The Oroville Dam Crisis The Oroville Dam, located in Northern California, is the tallest dam in the United States, standing at a staggering height of 770 feet. The dam forms an essential part of the California State Water Project and plays a critical role in managing the state's water supply system. In recent weeks, heavy rainfall had caused a rapid increase in the dam's reservoir levels, sparking concerns over potential leakage or spillage, which prompted authorities to order the evacuation of nearly 180,000 people. (Step 2: Provide background information on the location and importance of the dam, and explain the crisis) Efforts to Mitigate Dam Leak Risk In response to the alarming situation, authorities and emergency workers implemented several measures to mitigate the risk of spillage and alleviate pressure on the dam. These measures included the use of helicopters to drop bags of rocks on erosion-prone areas and the release of water through the dam's primary spillway. (Step 3: Discuss the efforts made by authorities to address the situation) Lifting of the Evacuation Order After careful monitoring of the situation and extensive work to repair and strengthen the dam, authorities determined that the imminent threat had been sufficiently mitigated, allowing them to lift the evacuation order for the affected residents. (Step 4: Explain the indicators that led the authorities to lift the evacuation order) Lessons Learned and Future Precautions The Oroville Dam crisis highlights the importance of proactive maintenance and investment in dam infrastructure, particularly as extreme weather events become more frequent due to climate change. Lessons learned from this situation will undoubtedly guide future policies on dam safety and emergency preparedness, ultimately working to protect the millions of people living in close proximity to dams all over the country. (Step 5: Conclude the article by discussing the lessons learned and the need for future precautions) Conclusion In summary, the evacuation order for 180,000 people living below the US's highest dam has now been lifted, thanks to the tireless efforts of authorities who managed to successfully mitigate the risk of spillage. Although the situation has been resolved, it reminds us of the importance of proper dam maintenance and planning to prevent similar crises in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Macy) are four middle-aged suburban men living in a Cincinnati area suburb who find themselves frustrated with the pace of daily life and lack of adventure. Doug is a dentist who has trouble relating to his son Billy (Dominic Janes), Dudley is a single clumsy computer programmer who is afraid to talk to women. Bobby is a henpecked plumber whose wife has made him return to work after having taken a year off to unsuccessfully write a book, and Woody is a rich lawyer married to a supermodel. They find escape from their daily routines on weekends by riding motorcycles together posing as a biker gang called the \\"Wild Hogs\\". One day, when Woody finds out his wife is divorcing him and leaving him bankrupt, he and his friends go on a road trip on their bikes to California. After encountering several misadventures, they end up at a local bar, where they meet a much larger biker gang called the Del Fuegos, headed by Jack Blade (Ray Liotta). Jack calls the Wild Hogs \\"posers\\" and has his gang take Dudley's bike after a bogus deal to exchange Dudley's bike for a new bike that is in fact old and derelict, forcing the men to leave with Dudley in a sidecar attached to Woody's bike. Outraged at their actions, Woody returns to the Del Fuegos bar and retrieves Dudley's bike, cuts off their bikes' fuel supplies in the process and fabricates a story to the other Wild Hogs of how he \\"negotiated\\" with them to return the bike. When the Del Fuegos hear the Wild Hogs riding back past the bar, they attempt to pursue them, only for the bikes to stall. Jack inadvertently drops his lit cigarette onto the ground, igniting the fuel leaking from the bikes which then causes the the bar to explode.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the first name of the daughter of the man who premiered a stream of \\"desk drawer\\" works in 1953? , can you please find it?   Stalin's death in 1953 was the biggest step toward Shostakovich's rehabilitation as a creative artist, which was marked by his Tenth Symphony. It features a number of musical quotations and codes (notably the DSCH and Elmira motifs, Elmira Nazirova being a pianist and composer who had studied under Shostakovich in the year before his dismissal from the Moscow Conservatory), the meaning of which is still debated, while the savage second movement, according to Testimony, is intended as a musical portrait of Stalin. The Tenth ranks alongside the Fifth and Seventh as one of Shostakovich's most popular works. 1953 also saw a stream of premieres of the \\"desk drawer\\" works. During the forties and fifties, Shostakovich had close relationships with two of his pupils, Galina Ustvolskaya and Elmira Nazirova. In the background to all this remained Shostakovich's first, open marriage to Nina Varzar until her death in 1954. He taught Ustvolskaya from 1937 to 1947. The nature of their relationship is far from clear: Mstislav Rostropovich described it as \\"tender\\". Ustvolskaya rejected a proposal of marriage from him after Nina's death. Shostakovich's daughter, Galina, recalled her father consulting her and Maxim about the possibility of Ustvolskaya becoming their stepmother. Ustvolskaya's friend Viktor Suslin said that she had been \\"deeply disappointed\\" in Shostakovich by the time of her graduation in 1947. The relationship with Nazirova seems to have been one-sided, expressed largely through his letters to her, and can be dated to around 1953 to 1956. He married his second wife, Komsomol activist Margarita Kainova, in 1956; the couple proved ill-matched, and divorced three years later. In 1954, Shostakovich wrote the Festive Overture, opus 96; it was used as the theme music for the 1980 Summer Olympics. (His '\\"Theme from the film Pirogov, Opus 76a: Finale\\" was played as the cauldron was lit at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece.) In 1959, Shostakovich appeared on stage in Moscow at the end of a concert performance...

What is the solution to this math problem? Solve -20*p - 42 = -75*p + 62*p for p.","output":"To solve the equation -20*p - 42 = -75*p + 62*p for p, we should follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms on both sides of the equation. On the right side of the equation, we have terms -75*p and 62*p, which we can combine. -75*p + 62*p = -13*p So the equation becomes: -20*p - 42 = -13*p Step 2: Move the terms containing p to one side of the equation and the constant terms to the other side. To do this, we will add 13*p to both sides of the equation to move the p terms to the left side. -20*p + 13*p - 42 = -13*p + 13*p -7*p - 42 = 0 Now, we will add 42 to both sides to move the constant term to the right side. -7*p - 42 + 42 = 0 + 42 -7*p = 42 Step 3: Solve for p. To find the value of p, we need to isolate p. We will do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -7. -7*p / -7 = 42 / -7 p = -6 So, the solution to the equation -20*p - 42 = -75*p + 62*p is p = -6."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Keaton's comedies are _innerly, harmoniously, intelligently ordered, thought. Wonderfully amusing, deliberately delightful and inventive, THREE AGES should belong to a draft of a comedies top ten if I were to sketch one. A threefold love story will enchant the viewers; I want to bring here this approachKeaton's comedy is like Lang's DESTINY upsidedownor À REBOURS. Again a couple traverses the waters of timeand of epochsin the Stone Age, in Rome and in Keaton's timesin a Mohammedan country, in Renaissance Italy and in China. The same device works in the both moviesone, a grim, eerie melodrama; --the other, a light, virtuouslypaced comedy. At Keaton it's essentially the same couple; and maybe the same is with Lang. The babe desired by both Buster and Beery is nice. I have found THREE AGES well written and smart, without being ostentatiously sophisticated; the plot is basically very POPEYElikethe babe is a piece of furniture, the only protagonists are the two male rivalsKeaton and Beery. Keaton's movie is simply enormously likable, and perhaps one would be tempted to assert this looks like ambitious funyet it's not, but it is grand fun, large fun, ample fun.

Possible answers: keep the money for the news, make the buyer angry, refund the money for the shoes","output":"Given the context, Quinn paid the buyer back to refund the money for the shoes. When a buyer returns a purchased product, it is customary and expected for the seller to provide a refund. This process ensures customer satisfaction and maintains the reputation of the seller. In this scenario, Quinn is adhering to standard business practices by returning the buyer's payment for the shoes upon receiving the returned product. There can be a variety of reasons why a buyer returns a product, such as dissatisfaction with the product's quality, the product not meeting their expectations, or the product not fitting properly (as in the case of shoes). By refunding the buyer when they return the product, Quinn demonstrates a commitment to provide a satisfactory shopping experience, acknowledges the buyer's concerns, and shows a willingness to address any issues arising from the purchase. Issue resolution through refunds is a key aspect of maintaining good customer relations. This approach enables sellers to build trust with their customers, which in turn can lead to repeat business, positive reviews, and word-of-mouth recommendations. On the other hand, if Quinn were to keep the money for the returned shoes or make the buyer angry by not providing a refund, this could have a negative impact on their reputation, deter potential buyers, and lead to business losses in the long run. In summary, Quinn paid the buyer back to refund the money for the shoes after the buyer returned their purchase. This action is in line with standard business practices, ensures customer satisfaction, and helps maintain the seller's reputation. By providing refunds upon receiving returns, businesses like Quinn's demonstrate their commitment to addressing buyer concerns and maintaining a positive shopping experience."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

One missile landed in an uninhabited area while at least one more is thought to have landed in the sea off the city. Meanwhile, Israel's defence minister has authorised the call-up of 30,000 reservists. The BBC's Richard Galpin, in Jerusalem, says speculation is mounting that the Israeli army is preparing to launch a ground offensive into the Gaza Strip. Eighteen Palestinians have been killed in Israeli operations against militants in Gaza since Wednesday afternoon, when an Israeli air strike killed the military leader of Hamas, the militant group that controls the territory, in his car in Gaza City. Three Israelis have died during a barrage of hundreds of missiles fired from Gaza, mostly into southern Israel, some of which have been intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system. The rocket fired at Tel Aviv that came down on dry land hit a field in the suburb of Rishon Lezion, south of the city. The armed wing of Islamic Jihad said it had fired an Iranian-built, Fajr-5 rocket at Tel Aviv. By Jeremy BowenBBC Middle East editor The danger of the kind of operation Israel has started is that rising casualties on both sides cause a violent escalation that neither side can control.  If that happens it could cause a much bigger crisis across the Middle East. By Wyre DaviesBBC News, Gaza The overwhelming mood in Gaza is sombre but vengeful. Sombre because few here want another war with Israel - another war in which civilians would undoubtedly suffer as much as the fighters. By Yolande KnellBBC News, Kiryat Malachi There is a gaping hole on the top floor of an old four-storey apartment building where two Israeli families were  living. A resident Yerumichael Simon told me: \\"I live across the street and I used to live inside that building.\\" BBC reporters on Israel-Gaza violence \\"We have widened the range of the battle to reach Tel Aviv and what is coming will be greater,\\" the group said in a statement. This is the first time Tel Aviv has been threatened by missiles since the first Gulf War, when missiles fired by Saddam Hussein's Iraq landed in the city. Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak said: \\"This escalation will exact a price that the other side will have to pay.\\" The Hamas Prime Minister in Gaza, Ismail Haniyeh, condemned what he called Israel's \\"ferocious assault\\" against the territory. \\"We here in Gaza will remain steadfast and unshaken,\\" he said in a televised statement. \\"We will fend off the aggression. \\"We are all confident in our intrepid resistance fighters who are now deployed on the front.\\" Late on Thursday, BBC correspondents in Gaza reported several massive explosions and missile fire in and around Gaza City as Israeli strikes continued. Many of the Palestinians killed in Gaza during the last two days by the Israeli aerial and naval bombardment were members of militant groups, but civilians - including at least four children - were also among the dead. They included 11-month-old Omar, the son of Jihad Misharawi, a BBC Arabic picture editor. The three Israeli civilians who died - two women and a man - were killed on the top floor of a block of flats in the southern town of Kiryat Malachi that suffered a direct hit by a rocket. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will do \\"everything in its power\\" to avoid civilian casualties in the conflict with Hamas. But he said Hamas was deliberately placing its rockets and missiles in civilian areas prior to launching them at Israel. \\"There is no moral symmetry between Israel and the terrorists in Gaza,\\" he said during a televised news conference in Tel Aviv. \\"Hamas deliberately targets our children and they deliberately place their rockets next to their children. Now despite this reality - and it's a difficult reality - Israel will continue to do everything in its power to avoid civilian casualties.\\" Egypt's new Islamist President Mohammed Mursi called the Israeli bombardment \\"unacceptable aggression\\". Egyptian Prime Minister Hisham Qandil is to travel to Gaza on Friday in a show of support for the people of the territory. The United States, Israel's key ally, has called on countries that have contact with Hamas to urge it to stop rocket attacks from Gaza. \\"We've... urged those that have a degree of influence with Hamas such as Turkey, and Egypt and some of our European partners to use that influence to urge Hamas to de-escalate,\\" said Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser, in a conference call with reporters. Asked if the US was concerned that Israeli ground forces would enter Gaza, Mr Rhodes said: \\"Ultimately it's up to the Israeli government to make determinations about how they're going to carry out their military objectives.\\" Arab League foreign ministers plan to meet in emergency session on Friday to discuss the escalating violence. Israel's aerial and naval bombardment of the Gaza Strip, which began after a recent wave of rocket attacks from there, is its most intense assault on the Palestinian territory since it launched a full-scale invasion four years ago, also in response to rocket fire.","output":"People living in a city had to hide because they were warned that something dangerous was flying towards them.

Do these sentences mean the same thing?","output":"Let's compare the two sentences step by step: 1. The subject of the first sentence is \\"Deodato,\\" while the subject of the second sentence is \\"Antônio Carlos Jobim.\\" This indicates a difference in which artist is the primary focus of each sentence. 2. In the first sentence, Tide is the sixth album by Deodato, while in the second sentence, Tide is the sixth album by Antônio Carlos Jobim. This suggests that each sentence claims a different artist is responsible for creating the sixth album named Tide. 3. The release year (1970) and record label (A&M Records) are consistent across both sentences. 4. The arranger of the album is different in each sentence. In the first sentence, the arranger is Antônio Carlos Jobim, while in the second sentence, the arranger is Deodato. Based on these observations, the sentences do not mean the same thing. The first sentence implies that Deodato released the album and Antônio Carlos Jobim arranged it, while the second sentence implies that Antônio Carlos Jobim released the album and Deodato arranged it.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the group that \\"[uses] lyrics to convey ideas while using them for the pleasurable way the words sound\\"? , can you please find it?   Stereolab's music is politically and philosophically charged. Dave Heaton of PopMatters said that the group \\"[uses] lyrics to convey ideas while using them for the pleasurable way the words sound.\\" The lyrics of the 2006 compilation Fab Four Suture, contains themes of war, governments that suppress freedom, and \\"the powerlessness that everyday people feel in the face of it all\\", in contrast to \\"humans [working] together, [treating] each other like people, and [pushing] for governments that would do the same.\\" Lætitia Sadier, who writes the group's lyrics, was influenced by both the Situationist philosophy Society of the Spectacle by Marxist theorist Guy Debord, and her anger towards the Iraq War. The Surrealist, as well as the Situationist cultural and political movements were also influences, as stated by Sadier and Gane in a 1999 Salon interview.Critics have seen Marxist allusions in the band's lyrics, and have gone so far as to call the band members themselves Marxist. Music journalist Simon Reynolds commented that Sadier's lyrics tend to lean towards Marxist social commentary rather than \\"affairs of the heart\\". The 1994 single \\"Ping Pong\\" has been put forward as evidence in regard to these alleged views. In the song, Sadier sings \\"about capitalism's cruel cycles of slump and recovery\\" with lyrics that constitute \\"a plainspoken explanation of one of the central tenets of Marxian economic analysis\\" (said critics Reynolds and Stewart Mason, respectively).Band members have resisted attempts to link the group and its music to Marxism. In a 1999 interview, Gane stated that \\"none of us are Marxists ... I've never even read Marx.\\" Gane said that although Sadier's lyrics touch on political topics, they do not cross the line into \\"sloganeering\\". Sadier also said that she had read very little Marx. In contrast, Cornelius Castoriadis, a radical political philosopher but strong critic of Marxism, has been cited as a marking influence in Sadier's thinking.

Failing to sell at the Summer Exhibition, The Combat was bought from Etty by fellow artist John Martin for 300 guineas (about £24,000 in 2019 terms), following a promise Martin had made to Etty before the painting was complete. The painting was too large for Martin's house, and in 1831 he sold it on to the Royal Scottish Academy. It was transferred in 1910 to the nearby National Gallery of Scotland where it remains. One of Etty's major works, it was exhibited at numerous major exhibitions including the seminal Art Treasures Exhibition of 1857, before Etty fell out of fashion in the second half of the 19th century. Throughout his life, The Combat continued to be considered one of Etty's most powerful paintings. In 1845, Etty took a smaller 89 by 118 cm (35 by 46 in) copy of The Combat, which had been painted by an unknown Edinburgh artist, and completely reworked it to serve as the basis for an engraving by George Thomas Doo. The engraving was published three years later, and the painting used as its model passed through the hands of several collectors in subsequent years, before entering the collection of the Ringling Museum in 1934. A number of sketches attributed to Etty, under the name of A Study for Mercy Interceding for the Vanquished, are also in circulation.After the success of The Combat, Etty continued with his preferred theme of history paintings containing nudity; of the 15 pictures he exhibited at the Royal Academy during the 1820s (including Cleopatra, Pandora and The Combat) all but one contained a nude figure. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, at that time the most prestigious honour available to an artist. The Combat was the first very large work attempted by Etty, and its success prompted him to produce further works on a similar scale over the rest of his career; he produced nine very large paintings illustrating moral themes throughout his career. As time went by his canvases came to be increasingly dominated by nude women.The 1832 exhibition of Youth on the Prow, and...

What is the last name of the person who discusses his plans to marry his childhood sweetheart?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  After a textual montage summarizing Edgar Allan Poe's life, the film begins in late September 1849 with Poe awakening from a hallucination where he is buried alive.  He prepares to take a trip to New York City via a ferry steamboat from Richmond, Virginia, to Baltimore, and from there, another ferry to New York City itself.  He discusses his plans to marry his childhood sweetheart Sarah Elmira Royster with a stranger taking the same steamboat, who suggests that he meet with a few potential investors for his planned magazine The Stylus.  Though Poe had intended only to pass through Baltimore, he agrees to meet the investors who, one by one, turn down his request for funding.  Poe is depicted as having some type of memory loss, which is first evident when he offers to pay his boat fare twice after forgetting he had already paid. In Baltimore, he more than once forgets the arrangements he has made at his hotel as his stay in the city is extended.  One night, he chooses to dine in a local tavern rather than at the hotel.  There, he meets an old friend from his days at West Point.  In desperation, he asks his former classmate and the classmate's companion for money to help start a magazine, saying proudly he has already raised 1,000.  Poe leaves the tavern to retrieve his prospectus for the magazine.  His classmate follows him and beats him up to steal the 1,000 he had collected. An injured and delirious Poe is then found by organizers of a cooping ring.  The author, along with several others, are forced to multiple polling locations around Baltimore to place multiple votes for the candidate for mayor.

Solve -10*p + 5 + 39 + 134 = -12 for p.","output":"To solve the equation -10*p + 5 + 39 + 134 = -12 for p, we will first simplify the equation by combining like terms and then isolating the variable p. Follow the steps below: Step 1: Combine like terms on the left side of the equation. -10*p + 5 + 39 + 134 = -12 Since 5, 39, and 134 are constants, we can add them. 5 + 39 + 134 = 178 So the equation becomes: -10*p + 178 = -12 Step 2: Isolate the variable p by moving the constant term to the right side of the equation. To move the constant term (178) to the right side, we subtract it from both sides of the equation. -10*p + 178 - 178 = -12 - 178 -10*p = -190 Step 3: Solve for p by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of p (-10). To get the value of p, we divide both sides by -10. (-10*p) / -10 = -190 / -10 p = 19 So, the solution to the equation, -10*p + 5 + 39 + 134 = -12, for p is p = 19."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Steve hurried through his tests, and continued to dream of other things. His heart was not in school, but in the woods. One day, Miss White's impatient voice broke into his daydreams. \\"Steve! Pay attention!\\" Steve turned to look at her, fixing his eyes on Miss White, as she began to go over the test results for the seventh grade. \\"You all did pretty well,\\" she told the class, \\"except for one boy, and it breaks my heart to tell you this, but...\\" She hesitated, her eyes searching his face. \\"...The smartest boy in the seventh grade is failing my class!\\" She just stared at Steve. Steve dropped his eyes. After that, it was war! Steve still wouldn't do his homework. Even as the punishments became more severe, he remained _  \\"Just try it! ONE WEEK!\\" He was unmoved. \\"You're smart enough! You'll see a change!\\" Nothing touched him. \\"Give yourself a chance! Don't give up on your life!\\" Nothing. \\"Steve! Please! I care about you!\\" Wow! Suddenly, Steve got it! Someone cared about him? Steve went home from school, thoughtful, that afternoon. Walking into the house, both parents were out. He, quickly, gathered up a jar of peanut butter, a loaf of bread, a bottle of water, and this time...his schoolbooks. The following Monday he arrived at school on time, and he waited for Miss White to enter the classroom. She walked in, all smiles! God, she was beautiful! Miss White, immediately, gave a quiz on the weekend homework. Steve hurried through the test and was the first to hand in his paper. With a look of surprise, Miss White took his paper. Obviously puzzled, she began to look it over. Miss White's face was in total shock! The smartest boy in the seventh grade had just passed his first test! From that moment nothing was the same for Steve. Life at home remained the same, but life still changed. He discovered that not only could he learn, but he was good at it! He discovered that he could understand knowledge and translate the things... Question: Steve used to be bad at his lessons because   _  . Yes or no, is the answer \\"he hadn't put his heart into his studies\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer \\"he hadn't put his heart into his studies\\" is accurate based on the information provided in the text. The story describes how Steve was uninterested in school and more focused on daydreaming and his fondness for the woods, indicating a lack of engagement with his studies. He hurried through tests and did not do his homework, demonstrating a lack of effort and commitment to his education. Further, the narrative shows that once Steve became aware that someone cared about him, specifically Ms. White, his attitude towards school work changed significantly. He started to take homework, arrived on time for school, and even managed to pass a test. His changed attitudes suggest that his previous poor performance was largely due to his lack of investment and interest in academics.  His life at home remained stable, indicating that the environment was not a key factor affecting his study. The narrative also does not outline examples of learning difficulties or intellectual limitations that could have hindered Steve's academic progress. Thus the assertion that \\"he hadn't put his heart into his studies\\" appears to be a comprehensive explanation for Steve's initial poor academic performance. In conclusion, Steve's academic difficulties stemmed from his lack of emotional investment and focus on his studies. His shift in attitude towards schoolwork, coupled with his inherent smartness, were key components that lead to his academic improvement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who gives Eep a shell horn?, using the article: A cave family called the Croods survives a natural disaster, due to the overprotective nature of their stubborn and stern patriarch named Grug. The only one who questions the family's sheltered life is his teenaged daughter Eep, who frequently disobeys her father's orders out of curiosity, which he finds dangerous. Grug and Eep, along with her mother and his wife Ugga, her grandmother Gran, and her younger brother and sister, Thunk and Sandy, face time sheltered in their cave home. Eep sneaks out when she sees what she discovers to be a torch of fire, and she encounters an inventive modern human boy named Guy and his pet sloth Belt. He warns her of an impending apocalypse and offers to take her with him, but concerned for her family, Eep stays, getting a shell horn from him to blow in case she needs his help. Reuniting with her frantic family, she tries to tell them what Guy told her, but fearing things that are \\"different\\" and \\"new\\", they destroy her horn. A massive earthquake then destroys their home, and to avoid carnivores and omnivores, they descend down into a tropical forest that lay hidden behind their cave all the time. Encountering a \\"Macawnivore\\", a brightly colored feline that Gran dubs \\"Chunky\\", the family flees him until he is scared off by swarms of piranhakeets that devour a ground whale. Using another horn, Eep calls to Guy who rescues them from the birds with his fire. After a great deal of confusion regarding their first contact with fire, Grug imprisons Guy in a log until he can guide them somewhere safe. Guy suggests the Croods go to a mountain where there are caves because the Crood family desires a cave. Grug refuses at first, but he decides to go with the promise of a cave. The other Croods were worried that they would get tired and bicker, but Grug doesn't listen., what would be the answer ?","output":"The first name of the person who gives Eep a shell horn is Guy.

Review: I am not going to spoil the contents to anyone, who has not yet watched this humble masterpiece by Kay Pollak. A world famous conductor brilliantly played by Michael Nyqvist seeks peace from stress by moving back to his childhood village. The villagers, who has followed the genius in silence, are slowly tempting him to share of his greatness. Each role in this movie, has a very specific purpose and shows a remarkable potential in each of the actors playing their own chord in short but precise words, a symphony of love. Not love in the sense of relationship, but in the tone of the spirit deeply buried within each of the characters, each revealing their own present story, their needs, their skeletons, desires and much more. I shall not forget to mention, the two main parts played by Frida Hallgren and Michael Nyqvist, whose dramas are played in unforgettable harmonies of emotional feedback. They touch each other with a pain connected in their own disability to love themselves. Michael Nyqvist is really put to the test here in a very difficult setup, in one of those movies that either end up as catastrophic or fantastic. And fantastic it became from start to end, not one second less or more than enough, you are left with a feeling of change and a taste for more.

An American flag still stands next to one of more than 170 toppled Jewish headstones after a weekend vandalism attack on Chesed Shel Emeth Cemetery in University City, a suburb of St Louis, Mo., on Feb. 21. (Tom Gannam/Reuters)      After the desecration of a Jewish cemetery in St. Louis over the long holiday weekend, an incident in which more than 150 headstones were toppled or damaged, two American Muslim activists started a fundraiser to help pay for needed repairs.      “Through this campaign, we hope to send a united message from the Jewish and Muslim communities that there is no place for this type of hate, desecration, and violence in America,” the fundraising page on the site LaunchingGood reads. “We pray that this restores a sense of security and peace to the Jewish-American community who has undoubtedly been shaken by this event.”      Within a few hours of going up Tuesday afternoon, the page had exceeded its goal of raising 20,000.      Tarek El-Messidi, who created the campaign with fellow activist Linda Sarsour said when he saw the news about the vandalism at Chesed Shel Emeth Society cemetery in the St. Louis suburb of University City, he was reminded of a story about the prophet Muhammad, who had stood up when a Jewish funeral procession passed. When asked why, he said, “Is it not a human soul?”      “That story goes to show more than anything the humanity of the prophet. … We should bring the story to life here and show every person deserves to rest in peace,” El-Messidi said. “This is a great way to show respect and honor for our Jewish cousins.”      Missouri authorities are investigating after dozens of headstones were damaged at a Jewish cemetery near St.Louis. (AP)      Through his nonprofit, Celebrate Mercy, El-Messidi’s mission is to not only educate people about the prophet’s teachings but also to rally Muslims to respond to evil with good. A national Muslim leader in Knoxville, Tenn., he helped launch a Muslim-led fundraiser for the victims of the San Bernardino terrorist attack in 2015 that ultimately raised more than 215,000. In 2012, after the attacks on U.S. diplomatic facilities in Benghazi that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans, El-Messidi called on Muslims to write condolence letters to the Stevens’s family and presented 8,000 of them to Steven’s sister that Thanksgiving.      [American Muslims ‘grieve for the victims like any other human being,’ raise more than 170,000 for San Bernardino families]      Since the rise of hate crime incidents after the November election, both Muslim and Jewish communities in the United States have been targeted, their institutions are threatened, their people bullied. It’s a shared experience that is bringing them together in solidarity, El-Messidi said.      “This is really a human issue,” he said. “But out of this horrible election cycle, something beautiful has come out of it and [Muslims and Jews have] bonded together to support each other and stand up to this hate. Politics can get in the way of our basic humanity; I hope this breaks through all those walls, no pun intended, to help bring us closer together.”      To underscore this point, El-Messidi shared a message he received from a woman named Barbara:      You have helped to heal the pain in my heart. I live in Los Angeles but was born and raised in St. Louis. I have family buried in that cemetery and was heartbroken seeing the desecration of the final resting place of some of my loved ones. Your kind and loving spirit gives hope to me that we can have mutual respect and tolerance of our differences and shared humanity. Bless you.      El-Messidi said he has been communicating with the director of the cemetery who was going to send him an exact estimate of the damages, but he doesn’t have that figure yet. If they raise more than is needed, he said they will keep a leftover fund that will be used to counter anti-Semitic hate.

Greitens said President Donald Trump called him Wednesday morning to thank the people of Missouri \\"for standing up in the fight against anti-Semitism.\\"      Pence thanked residents for their efforts to restore the toppled headstones and said, \\"There is no place in America for hatred or acts of prejudice or violence or anti-Semitism.\\"      After Pence and Greitens concluded their remarks, they prayed with others at the scene, then Pence picked up a rake and helped in the cleanup.

You have to constantly reset zero. The LCD keeps flashing when measuring (even after I replaced the battery). Total junk! Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","output":"The review provided for the product in question depicts the product in an unflattering light, as it highlights several negative aspects and expresses dissatisfaction with its performance. There are a few reasons behind this conclusion: 1. Inaccuracy: The reviewer states that the product often has an error margin of more than 1mm. This suggests that the product fails to deliver consistent and accurate results, which could be detrimental for certain applications where precision is crucial. 2. Inconsistency: The reviewer mentions that the product does not repeat its readings. This lack of repeatability can be problematic, as users must rely on consistent measurements in order to confidently compare results or track changes in the properties being measured. 3. Constant resetting: According to the reviewer, the product requires frequent resetting to zero. This might indicate flawed calibration, as the device should retain its zero point for accurate measurements. Having to constantly reset the zero point is inconvenient, time-consuming, and could lead to further inaccuracies in the results. 4. LCD flashing: The reviewer cites that the LCD display continues to flash, even after they replaced the battery. This can be a source of distraction and frustration, hindering the overall user experience. It might also suggest a fault in the electronic components. 5. Designation as \\"total junk\\": Lastly, the reviewer labels the product as \\"total junk,\\" which is an unequivocal expression of dissatisfaction.

In summary, the review presents the product unfavorably, highlighting its inability to provide accurate, repeatable readings and criticizing its constant resetting and flashing LCD screen.

Text: A check is a condition in chess, shogi, and xiangqi that occurs when a player's king (or general in xiangqi) is under threat of capture on their opponent's next turn. A king so threatened is said to be in check. A player must get out of check, if possible, by interposing a piece between the threatening piece and the king, capturing the threatening piece, or moving the king to a square where it is no longer in check. If the player cannot move out of check, the game ends in checkmate and the player loses. Players cannot make any move that puts their own king in check. Question: can you only move the king in check?","output":"No, sweetie, you don't only have to move the king when you're in check in chess. There are a few things you can do to get out of check. You can move your king to a spot where your opponent can't capture it, kind of like playing hide and seek. Or, you can use one of your other chess pieces to block the check, acting like a shield for your king. Another option is to capture the piece that is putting your king in check, like playing \\"tag, you're it!\\" These options help to keep your king safe.

We waited for half an hour, watching the smoke curling over the house, and then, judging that the Indians had made off for fear of being ambushed, we crossed the clearing.  It took but a glance to read the story.  The women had been washing by the little brook before the cabin, with the children playing about them, when the Indians had come up and with a single volley killed them all except the child we had heard crying.  They had swooped down upon their victims, torn the scalps from their heads, looted the house, and set fire to it.  We dragged out the body of the woman which had been thrown within, in the hope that a spark of life might yet remain, but she was quite dead.  Beneath the warrior Spiltdorph had shot we found the child.  It was a boy of some six or seven years, and so covered with blood that it seemed it must be dead.  But we stripped it and washed it in the brook, and found no wounds upon it except in the head, where it had been struck with a hatchet before its scalp had been stripped off.  The cold water brought it back to life and it began to cry again, whereat Spiltdorph took off his coat and wrapped it tenderly about it.

Passage:In 1964 he moved to Santa Monica, California, and formed Rising Sons with fellow blues rock musician Ry Cooder and Jessie Lee Kincaid, landing a record deal with Columbia Records soon after. The group was one of the first interracial bands of the period, which likely made them commercially unviable. An album was never released (though a single was) and the band soon broke up, though Legacy Records did release The Rising Sons Featuring Taj Mahal and Ry Cooder in 1992 with material from that period. During this time Mahal was working with others, musicians like Howlin' Wolf, Buddy Guy, Lightnin' Hopkins, and Muddy Waters. Mahal stayed with Columbia after the Rising Sons to begin his solo career, releasing the self-titled Taj Mahal in 1968, The Natch'l Blues in 1969, and Giant Step/De Old Folks at Home with Kiowa session musician Jesse Ed Davis from Oklahoma, who played guitar and piano (also in 1969). During this time he and Cooder worked with the Rolling Stones, with whom he has performed at various times throughout his career. In 1968, he performed in the film The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus. He recorded a total of twelve albums for Columbia from the late 1960s into the 1970s. His work of the 1970s was especially important, in that his releases began incorporating West Indian and Caribbean music, jazz and reggae into the mix. In 1972, he acted in and wrote the film score for the movie Sounder, which starred Cicely Tyson. He reprised his role and returned as composer in the sequel, Part 2, Sounder.

We learn that the Rising Sons were initially signed by Columbia Records and later, Legacy Records released material from their time. However, no explicit information is given about the locations of these companies. Part #3: Determine whether information from the passage can be used to answer the question. Usage: The passage doesn't explicitly state where these two companies (Columbia Records and Legacy Records) are based. Thus, using only this passage, we are unable to derive an answer.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Petrus Christus placed his sitter in a naturalistic setting rather than a flat and featureless background. This approach was in part a reaction against van der Weyden, who, in his emphasis on sculptural figures, utilised very shallow pictorial spaces. In his 1462 Portrait of a Man, Dieric Bouts went further by situating the man in a room complete with a window that looks out at a landscape, while in the 16th century, the full-length portrait became popular in the north. The latter format was practically unseen in earlier northern art, although it had a tradition in Italy going back centuries, most usually in fresco and illuminated manuscripts. Full-length portraits were reserved for depictions of the highest echelon of society, and were associated with princely displays of power. Of the second generation of northern painters, Hans Memling became the leading portraitist, taking commissions from as far as Italy. He was highly influential on later painters and is credited with inspiring Leonardo's positioning of the Mona Lisa in front of a landscape view. Van Eyck and van der Weyden similarly influenced the French artist Jean Fouquet and the Germans Hans Pleydenwurff and Martin Schongauer among others.The Netherlandish artists moved away from the profile view – popularised during the Italian Quattrocento – towards the less formal but more engaging three-quarter view. At this angle, more than one side of the face is visible as the sitter's body is rotated towards the viewer. This pose gives a better view of the shape and features of the head and allows the sitter to look out towards the viewer. The gaze of the sitter rarely engages the viewer. Van Eyck's 1433 Portrait of a Man is an early example, which shows the artist himself looking at the viewer.  Although there is often direct eye contact between subject and viewer, the look is normally detached, aloof and uncommunicative, perhaps to reflect the subject's high social position. There are exceptions, typically in bridal portraits or in the case of potential... The answer to this question is:","output":"Hans Memling"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"The heir apparent of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1914 was Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. He was born on December 18, 1863, in Graz, Austria, and was the eldest son of Archduke Karl Ludwig of Austria, the younger brother of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria. Archduke Franz Ferdinand was formally known as Franz Ferdinand Karl Ludwig Joseph Maria of Austria, and he was a member of the House of Habsburg, one of the most powerful royal families in European history. As the heir presumptive to the throne, he held the title of Archduke of Austria-Este, a title primarily used by the heirs apparent to the Habsburg rulers since the 15th century. While Emperor Franz Joseph's relations with his nephew were somewhat strained due to Franz Ferdinand's unconventional marriage to Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, a lady-in-waiting who was not of equal rank or with the equal royal lineage required for a Habsburg marriage, Franz Ferdinand's position as the heir apparent was not contested. Emperor Franz Joseph eventually gave his blessing to the marriage, but it resulted in a morganatic union, meaning Sophie and her descendants would not have a claim to the Habsburg titles or the throne. Despite the controversy surrounding his personal life, Franz Ferdinand was known to have progressive ideas for the future governance of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He recognized the need for political, military, and economic reform to address the increasing tensions among the empire's numerous ethnic groups, as well as to solidify the empire's position against its rivals in Europe. However, Franz Ferdinand's time as heir apparent would be tragically cut short due to his assassination on June 28, 1914, by Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb nationalist part of the Black Hand secret society. The assassination sparked a chain of events that led to the outbreak of World War I, as the Austro-Hungarian Empire issued an ultimatum to Serbia, leading to a web of alliances being activated across Europe, plunging the continent into a devastating conflict. Following the assassination of Franz Ferdinand and his wife, the next heir presumptive to the throne became Archduke Karl Franz Joseph, the grandnephew of Emperor Franz Joseph, who would later ascend the throne as Emperor Karl I of Austria and King Charles IV of Hungary. Unfortunately, World War I would bring the downfall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, leading to its dissolution and the end of the Habsburg rule in 1918."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

First, we can express the hyperbola equations in terms of points A and B: frac{x_1^2}{9} - frac{y_1^2}{4} = 1, quad frac{x_2^2}{9} - frac{y_2^2}{4} = 1 Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get: frac{1}{9}(x_1^2 - x_2^2) - frac{1}{4}(y_1^2 - y_2^2) = 0 Using difference of squares, we can rewrite the equation as: frac{1}{9}(x_1 - x_2)(x_1 + x_2) - frac{1}{4}(y_1 - y_2)(y_1 + y_2) = 0 Since (6, 2) is the midpoint of AB, we have: x_1 + x_2 = 12, quad y_1 + y_2 = 4 Now, we can find the slope of line l using the slope formula: k = frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = frac{4}{12-x_1 - x_2} = frac{4}{3} Thus, the slope of line l is boxed{frac{4}{3}}."},{"instruction":"The two scales shown are balanced.

Prove that there exists an axis such that the projection of each of the ten vectors onto this axis is positive.","output":"1. **Define the Given Vectors:**    Let the given vectors be (boldsymbol{e}_1, boldsymbol{e}_2, ldots, boldsymbol{e}_{10}).  2. **Sum of All Vectors:**    We denote the sum of all 10 vectors by (overrightarrow{AB} = boldsymbol{e}_1 + boldsymbol{e}_2 + cdots + boldsymbol{e}_{10}). 3. **Vector Subtraction and Squaring:**    Consider any vector (boldsymbol{e}_i). The squared length of (overrightarrow{AB} - boldsymbol{e}_i) is given by:    [    left| overrightarrow{AB} - boldsymbol{e}_i right|^2 = left(overrightarrow{AB} - boldsymbol{e}_iright) cdot left(overrightarrow{AB} - boldsymbol{e}_iright)    ] 4. **Expanding the Dot Product:**    We expand the dot product using the distributive property:    [    left(overrightarrow{AB} - boldsymbol{e}_iright) cdot left(overrightarrow{AB} - boldsymbol{e}_iright) = (overrightarrow{AB} cdot overrightarrow{AB}) - 2 (overrightarrow{AB} cdot boldsymbol{e}_i) + (boldsymbol{e}_i cdot boldsymbol{e}_i)    ]    This simplifies to:    [    left| overrightarrow{AB} - boldsymbol{e}_i right|^2 = AB^2 - 2 (overrightarrow{AB} cdot boldsymbol{e}_i) + left| boldsymbol{e}_i right|^2    ]    where (AB = left| overrightarrow{AB} right|). 5. **Isolating the Dot Product:**    Rearrange the above equation to isolate the dot product ((overrightarrow{AB}, boldsymbol{e}_i)):    [    2 (overrightarrow{AB} cdot boldsymbol{e}_i) = AB^2 + left| boldsymbol{e}_i right|^2 - left| overrightarrow{AB} - boldsymbol{e}_i right|^2    ]    Thus:    [    (overrightarrow{AB} cdot boldsymbol{e}_i) = frac{AB^2 + left| boldsymbol{e}_i right|^2 - left| overrightarrow{AB} - boldsymbol{e}_i right|^2}{2}    ] 6. **Condition from Problem Statement:**    Given that the length of the sum of any 9 vectors is less than the sum of the lengths of all 10 vectors, we have:    [    AB > left| overrightarrow{AB} - boldsymbol{e}_i right|    ]    From this, it follows that:    [    AB^2 > left| overrightarrow{AB} - boldsymbol{e}_i right|^2    ]    Therefore:    [    AB^2 + left| boldsymbol{e}_i right|^2 > left| overrightarrow{AB} - boldsymbol{e}_i right|^2    ] 7. **Conclusively Positive Dot Product:**    Hence, the expression for ((overrightarrow{AB}, boldsymbol{e}_i)) will be strictly positive:    [    (overrightarrow{AB} cdot boldsymbol{e}_i) > 0    ] 8. **Positive Projection Conclusion:**    Since the dot product ((overrightarrow{AB}, boldsymbol{e}_i)) is positive, it follows that the projection of each vector (boldsymbol{e}_i) onto the direction of (overrightarrow{AB}) (the axis defined by (A) and (B)) is positive. # Conclusion:    Therefore, there exists an axis (the direction of (overrightarrow{AB})) such that the projection of each of the ten vectors onto this axis is positive.

Assume the radius of the second and third circles are ( r_2 ) and ( r_3 ) respectively. According to the problem, each circle touches the previous one and they are pairwise similar figures. This implies that the radii of the circles form a geometric progression. Let ( r_1 = 1 ) be the radius of the first circle. 3. Let the common ratio of the geometric progression be ( k ).

Therefore, ( k^2 leq n < (k+1)^2 ). 4. We need ( k ) to be a divisor of ( n ). This means ( n = mk ) for some integer ( m ). 5. Since ( k^2 leq n < (k+1)^2 ), substituting ( n = mk ) gives ( k^2 leq mk < (k+1)^2 ). 6. Dividing the entire inequality by ( k ), we get ( k leq m < k + frac{2k+1}{k} ). 7. Simplifying the right-hand side, we get ( k leq m < k + 2 + frac{1}{k} ). 8. Since ( m ) must be an integer, the possible values for ( m ) are ( k, k+1, k+2 ) (as ( frac{1}{k} ) is less than 1 for all ( k geq 1 )). 9. Therefore, for each ( k ), there are three values of ( n ) that satisfy the condition: ( n = k^2, n = k^2 + k, n = k^2 + 2k ). 10. We need to count the number of such ( n ) for ( n leq 10000 ). 11.

Javier wants to bring his average for the season up to 3 hits a game. The total number of games for the season will be ( x + 10 ). To find the total number of hits he needs for the entire season to average 3 hits per game, we multiply the total number of games by 3: Total hits needed = ( 3 times (x + 10) ) Now, we know that the total hits he will have made by the end of the season is the sum of the hits from the first ( x ) games and the hits from the last 10 games: Total hits made = ( 2x + 50 ) Setting the total hits needed equal to the total hits made, we get: ( 3 times (x + 10) = 2x + 50 ) Expanding the left side of the equation, we get: ( 3x + 30 = 2x + 50 ) Now, we solve for ( x ): ( 3x - 2x = 50 - 30 ) ( x = 20 ) So, Javier initially played boxed{20}  games."},{"instruction":"For the binomial expression left( frac{1}{x}+x^{3} right)^{n}(ninmathbb{N}^{*}), there are the following four judgments: ① There exists ninmathbb{N}^{*}, such that the expanded expression contains a constant term; ② For any ninmathbb{N}^{*}, the expanded expression does not contain a constant term; ③ For any ninmathbb{N}^{*}, the expanded expression does not contain a linear term of x; ④ There exists ninmathbb{N}^{*}, such that the expanded expression contains a linear term of x.

Sales for 2012 are projected to grow by 20 percent. Interest expense will remain constant; the tax rate and the dividend payout rate will also remain constant.

If the firm is operating at full capacity and no new debt or equity is issued, what external financing is needed to support the 20 percent growth rate in sales? C4-Q24.png","output":"首先，我们需要找到估计后的收入和变动支出。我们可以使用成本、其他费用和应付账款的百分比，其与销售成比例增长。我们可以将这些费用的预测数值添加到表中： C4-Q24-1.png 如上所示，我们预计2012年的销售额将达到12,000，比2011年增长20％。变动成本和费用会按比例增长，以支持新的销售额。 接下来，我们可以使用表中的数据计算销售增长所需的外部融资。要计算这个值，我们需要计算2012年的打新资金和可自我融资的金额。 对于何时需要外部融资的问题，我们观察到收入和非负债性支出以及投资都会以与销售成比例的速度增长。因此，增加的大部分资产都是自我融资的，但利息费用需要外部融资的支持。 我们可以从2011年中找到利息支出数值，并假设这个数值保持不变。然后，我们可以使用以下公式计算可自我融资金额： 自由现金流 = 净利润 + 折旧—资本支出—变动资本支出 我们可以先估计资本支出和变动资本支出。然后，我们可以使用上面的公式计算自由现金流。 首先，我们计算2012年的资本支出预测数值。资本支出可以通过使用固定资产的第一个数值和折旧支出增加额来计算。 资本支出= 固定资产增加额 + 折旧增加额 资本支出= (1,500 - 1,200) + (350 - 289) = 111 接下来，我们计算2012年的变动资本支出预测数值。这可以通过对增加收入和非负债支出的变动费用进行一些简单计算来完成。变动资本支出等于增加存货、应收账款和应付账款的总和。请看下面的计算： 变动资本支出 = 增加存货 + 增加应收账款 - 增加应付账款 变动资本支出 = (5,775 - 4,845) + (1,710 - 1,425) - (2,190 - 1,680) = 695 现在我们有了每个组成部分所需的数值，我们之后可以直接进行计算： 自由现金流 = 净利润 + 折旧—资本支出—变动资本支出 自由现金流 = 960 + 289 - 111-695 = 443 接下来，我们需要计算外部融资的总额。确定这个值，我们从自由现金流中减去预计的利息支出。这里有一个陷阱，即需要将利息支出除以（1-税率），然后才能将该值减去自由现金流。这是因为在现金流中，利息支出是在税收计算之前完成的，因此我们需要正确地解决这个因素。 利息支出后的可用自由现金流=自由现金流 - 利息支出 ÷ (1-税率） 利息支出后的可用自由现金流= 443 - 198 ÷ (1 - 0.35) ≈ 211 最终，我们使用公式 外部融资= 增加后的总资产—增加后的所有负债—可自我融资金额 外部融资= (8,932 - 7,097) - 211 = 1,624 因此，答案是1,624。"},{"instruction":"【单选题】You are investing 100 today in a savings account at your local bank.

The intersection of artifi- cial intelligence, EEG, and education has become an inspiring field, showing great potential in enhancing cognitive engagement, customized learning strate- gies, and improving education reachability. In papers that discussed the inter- vention of artificial intelligence and EEG, has shown initial success. However, 13 there are still some problems and challenges, preventing the wide application of these technologies in education. General Problem Statement The combination of artificial intelligence and EEG in educational environments has shown promising perspectives, but applying these technologies is still chal- lenging. There are still gaps in understanding how EEG and artificial intelligence could estimate the cognitive states, the ethical implications of these technologies, and how to transform such research into practical class settings. To solve these problems, we need to comprehensively study EEG and artificial intelligence to enhance education, Scholarly support We’ve noticed that some studies have emphasized these challenges. For example, Rasheed et al (2021) showed the potential of predicting learning outcomes using EEG and artificial intelligence, but they also emphasized that more evaluation is needed. Similarly, Mostow, Chang, and Nelson (2011) showed the perspectives of using EEG data to optimize learning. However, this technology needs further exploration in practical application. Schwarz et al (2021) and Bos et al (2020) em- phasized the potential of engaging neural games and chatbot into education pro- cess, but whether these tools can be effective over time need more research. These examples, showed these unsolved problems in the intersection of EEG, artificial intelligence, and education, Specific Problem statement To solve these problems, the research should focus on the following domains: 1) EEG-based methods and artificial intelligence algorithms: improving the EEG data collection, processing, and the training of artificial intelligence model are critical for accurately estimating the customized learning and intervention. 2) Ethical consideration: When we deploy artificial intelligence and EEG to edu- cational environments, we must consider their ethical implications, including data privacy and the potential bias of the artificial intelligence model. Closing commentary 14 If these challenges above cannot be solved, we may not unlock the full power of artificial intelligence and EEG in the field of education. Ineffective practice may result in the waste of resources, potential privacy invasion, and miss the chance to improve learning. However, if these problems are solved properly, we can gain huge benefits, including customized learning strategies, improved reacha- bility, and overall education outcomes. Therefore, it is not only necessary but also crucial to overcome these challenges. Research Questions How to optimize the combination of artificial intelligence and EEG, to improve learning experience and outcomes? Meanwhile, how to solve these ethical chal- lenges and transform to practical class setting? Sub-questions 1. How to refine the EEG methods and artificial intelligence algorithms to im- prove the measurement of cognitive states and customized learning? 2. What ethical implications should be considered when integrating EEG and ar- tificial intelligence into education? How to solve these problems? 3. How can the integration of artificial intelligence align with the educational theories to improve the learning experience? 4. What strategies are needed in practicing artificial intelligence and EEG in physical and digital classrooms? These sub-questions fulfill the criteria for complexity and arguability. When ask- ing “how”, meaning a detailed and complex answer is needed rather than a sim- ple numerical value or yes/no response. Furthermore, they are arguable because they can be solved by facts and empirical evidence instead of subjective opinions. The first question focusses on the technical sides of integrating artificial intelli- gence and EEG. The expected answers would involve the improved technology of EEG collection and processing, and new methods to train artificial intelligence models. These can be supported by research and experiments. 15 The second question discussed ethical considerations. The potential answers could involve data privacy, informed consent, potential bias, and the solutions to these ethical problems. This can be supported by making ethical guidelines, policy documents, and literature on ethics artificial intelligence and EEG. The third question discussed the teaching meaning of using artificial intelligence and EEG. The expected answer may include discussing how artificial intelligence and EEG could complement educational theories. The fourth question discussed the practical problems applying artificial intelli- gence and EEG in classrooms? The answers may include discussing the cost of deploying these technologies, their user-friendliness, and necessity of training teachers. In conclusion, these research problems aim to reveal the overall understanding of artificial intelligence and EEG in the field of education. They cover technical, ethical, teaching, and practice, which are a comprehensive exploration. These an- swers can greatly promote the knowledge based and accelerate the policy and pave the way for using artificial intelligence and EEG in education responsibly. summarize the above research statement","output":"The research statement focuses on the challenges and potential of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and electroencephalogram (EEG) technologies in educational environments.

The research aims to tackle four main questions: (1) refining EEG methods and AI algorithms to improve cognitive state measurement and personalized learning, (2) addressing ethical implications regarding data privacy, consent, and bias, (3) examining the alignment of AI and EEG integration with educational theories, and (4) identifying strategies for practical implementation in both physical and digital classrooms. These questions cover various aspects, including technical, ethical, educational, and practical issues, to provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of AI and EEG in education. The goal is to enhance educational outcomes, promote knowledge in the field, and pave the way for responsible implementation of these technologies."},{"instruction":"Activity As online education becomes more and more popular and starts to gain reputation, concerns about its equity and fairness started popping up. Some people believe online education will help realize the goal of education for all, while others think it will have opposite effects that widen the gaps of education. We’ll examine the connection between online education and equity to address this concerns. We take it for granted that online education will provide easier access simply because it only requires an ethernet connection and an electronic device; however, in some developing countries, internet access remains to be a problem. A study shows that internet access in Nigeria is limited (Abdulmajeed et al., 2020). According to a study, approximately 80% of Nigerians do not have access to the internet (Olanrewaju et al., 2021). This indicates online education remains inaccessible in some regions—especially poor countries, which prevent online education from benefiting everyone, because of the lack of infrastructure. However, nowadays it’s possible to address this issue with satellite internet services like Starlink. Even if the internet is available, some totalitarian countries like China implemented firewalls to prevent information from flowing freely. One can get away with it using a Virtual Private Network (VPN). However, such counter-measure will introduce legal issues. Cybersovereignty: The Example of China suggests that “a resident of China was sentenced to 5.5 years in prison for illegally setting up a VPN network” (Farrkhodovna & Qizi, 2022). It shows online education can also be unavailable in some areas because of political reasons. Furthermore, in some countries, online education is not recognizable and is considered an inferior quality. A report shows that “China’s Ministry of Education will no longer recognize online degrees from overseas colleges” (D’Agostino, 2023), which will hurt learner’s motivation toward online education and shape their attitudes negatively. This indicates online education will be treated differently depending on regions. Online education still has a long-way to go to expand its equity. On the other hand, however, online education can promote equity for students. Georgia Tech is known for its excellence in science engineering field, but to get into its on-campus program is extremely hard because of huge numbers of people applying and limited seats offered on campus. It is shown that only 12% non-residents who applied got admitted (Georgia Tech Admission Announces Decisions, 2023). On the contract, its online master degree in computer science has acceptance rate of 63% (Accepted into Georgia Tech OMSCS!, 2018). This truly promoted equity with the means of online education. To sum up, online education has a lack of equity in some regions while it promotes availability in other places. Although online education is far from perfect and ideal, many researches are still on-going to help combat these issues. Hopefully one day it can realize its idea of education for all.

Some view online education as a means to achieve education for all, while others argue that it might widen the existing gaps in education. This paper examines the connection between online education and equity, focusing on accessibility challenges as well as the potential benefits it offers in promoting fairness in education. Access to Online Education Internet Access Issues One major challenge to online education equity is the limited internet access in some areas, especially developing countries. A study by Abdulmajeed et al. (2020) highlights that internet access in Nigeria is limited, with approximately 80% of Nigerians not having access to the internet (Olanrewaju et al., 2021). This lack of internet infrastructure hinders the effectiveness of online education in these regions. However, advancements in satellite internet services, like Starlink, may offer potential solutions to improve internet accessibility. Political Constraints on Online Education In some totalitarian countries, such as China, political obstacles further impede the equity of online education. For example, as Farrkhodovna and Qizi (2022) note, internet censorship via firewalls prevents the free flow of information and limits access to educational resources online. Although VPNs can bypass these restrictions, their use may introduce legal issues, as individuals may face consequences such as imprisonment for using VPNs in certain regions (Farrkhodovna & Qizi, 2022). Lack of Recognition and Quality Concerns In addition to accessibility barriers, the lack of recognition of online education by certain institutions or countries can affect its equity. In China, the Ministry of Education has announced that it will no longer recognize online degrees from overseas colleges (D'Agostino, 2023). This decision may discourage learners from pursuing online education and perpetuate negative perceptions about the quality of such programs, further hindering equity in online education. Promoting Equity through Online Education Increased Access to High-Quality Programs Despite these challenges, online education has the potential to promote equity by offering increased access to high-quality educational programs. For instance, Georgia Tech is renowned for its excellence in science and engineering but has limited physical capacity to accommodate all interested students. The on-campus acceptance rate for non-residents is only 12% (Georgia Tech Admission Announces Decisions, 2023). In contrast, the acceptance rate for the online master's degree program in computer science is significantly higher at 63% (Accepted into Georgia Tech OMSCS!, 2018). By expanding access to their programs through online platforms, institutions like Georgia Tech can enhance educational equity. Flexible and Inclusive Learning Online education can also promote equity by offering flexibility and inclusivity in learning. Students who face geographical, financial, or personal constraints can benefit from the ability to access courses and materials from anywhere, at any time, and at their own pace (Han et al., 2022). This flexibility is especially beneficial for adult learners, part-time students, and individuals with disabilities, helping to promote equitable learning experiences for a diverse range of individuals. Conclusion While online education does face challenges in terms of accessibility, recognition, and quality, it also offers significant potential to promote equity in education. Research and development efforts are required to address internet infrastructure and political constraints, as well as reputational and quality issues that persist in some regions. With continued innovation, collaborative effort, and investment, online education can move closer to realizing its promise of education for all. References Abdulmajeed, K., Joyner, D.

Some view online education as a means to achieve education for all, while others argue that it might widen the existing gaps in education. This paper examines the connection between online education and equity, focusing on accessibility challenges as well as the potential benefits it offers in promoting fairness in education. Access to Online Education Internet Access Issues One major challenge to online education equity is the limited internet access in some areas, especially developing countries. A study by Abdulmajeed et al. (2020) highlights that internet access in Nigeria is limited, with approximately 80% of Nigerians not having access to the internet (Olanrewaju et al., 2021). This lack of internet infrastructure hinders the effectiveness of online education in these regions. However, advancements in satellite internet services, like Starlink, may offer potential solutions to improve internet accessibility (Torsner, Nwankwo & Adetunji, 2019). Political Constraints on Online Education In some totalitarian countries, such as China, political obstacles further impede the equity of online education. For example, as Farrkhodovna and Qizi (2022) note, internet censorship via firewalls prevents the free flow of information and limits access to educational resources online. Although VPNs can bypass these restrictions, their use may introduce legal issues, as individuals may face consequences such as imprisonment for using VPNs in certain regions (Farrkhodovna & Qizi, 2022). Moreover, restrictive regulations on online content, as seen in countries like Iran, can impact access to quality educational materials (Protopsaltis & Baum, 2019). Lack of Recognition and Quality Concerns In addition to accessibility barriers, the lack of recognition of online education by certain institutions or countries can affect its equity. In China, the Ministry of Education has announced that it will no longer recognize online degrees from overseas colleges (D'Agostino, 2023). This decision may discourage learners from pursuing online education and perpetuate negative perceptions about the quality of such programs, further hindering equity in online education. Indeed, research suggests that negative perceptions of online education may be associated with the lack of recognition and accreditation (Tamim et al., 2015). Promoting Equity through Online Education Increased Access to High-Quality Programs Despite these challenges, online education has the potential to promote equity by offering increased access to high-quality educational programs. For instance, Georgia Tech is renowned for its excellence in science and engineering but has limited physical capacity to accommodate all interested students. The on-campus acceptance rate for non-residents is only 12% (Georgia Tech Admission Announces Decisions, 2023). In contrast, the acceptance rate for the online master's degree program in computer science is significantly higher at 63% (Accepted into Georgia Tech OMSCS!, 2018). By expanding access to their programs through online platforms, institutions like Georgia Tech can enhance educational equity (Goldrick-Rab et al., 2018). Flexible and Inclusive Learning Online education can also promote equity by offering flexibility and inclusivity in learning. Students who face geographical, financial, or personal constraints can benefit from the ability to access courses and materials from anywhere, at any time, and at their own pace (Han et al., 2022). This flexibility is especially beneficial for adult learners, part-time students, and individuals with disabilities, helping to promote equitable learning experiences for a diverse range of individuals (Castaño Muñoz et al., 2014). Conclusion While online education does face challenges in terms of accessibility, recognition, and quality, it also offers significant potential to promote equity in education. Research and development efforts are required to address internet infrastructure and political constraints, as well as reputational and quality issues that persist in some regions. With continued innovation, collaborative effort, and investment, online education can move closer to realizing its promise of education for all. References Abdulmajeed, K., Joyner, D.

This is particularly important for disadvantaged and low-income students who may otherwise struggle with the financial burden associated with higher education. Lower Costs of Attendance The cost of attending online programs is generally lower than that of traditional, on-campus programs. This is because online students often do not incur additional expenses related to housing, transportation, and on-campus facilities (Hillman, 2012). In some cases, online programs also offer lower tuition fees than their on-campus counterparts due to cost savings in the delivery of instruction (Barr & Miller, 2013). As a result, online education offers more affordable options for low-income students, making higher education more accessible to this group. Flexibility for Employment Online education's inherent flexibility allows students who are low-income earners or who need to support themselves financially, the ability to work while pursuing their studies (Carruthers & Fox, 2016). This is particularly important for those who may not be able to afford the costs of living and studying without maintaining a source of income. Online learners can structure their study schedules around their work obligations, minimizing the need to make a choice between their livelihoods and education. Financial Aid Opportunities Additionally, the availability of financial aid opportunities for online students has improved over the years, providing further financial support for low-income students (Deming et al., 2015). Scholarships, grants, and loans are increasingly made available for students in online courses and degree programs, enabling more equitable access to quality education (Jaggars, 2014). Recent changes in federal financial aid policies, for instance, have expanded access to online students, ensuring that the financial barriers to online education are gradually being reduced (Lederman, 2018). Conclusion The affordability of online education, coupled with its flexibility and increasing availability of financial aid, plays a significant role in lowering the financial barriers to education for low-income students. By offering more accessible and affordable options for higher education, online programs contribute to promoting equity in education and can potentially help lift individuals out of poverty.

По временному горизонту: - Краткосрочное (оперативное) планирование: охватывает период до одного года и составляется в разрезе месяцев или кварталов. Основной задачей является определение финансовых потоков, обеспечение ликвидности и контроль выполнения плановых задач. - Среднесрочное планирование: охватывает срок от одного до трех лет. Фокусируется на содержательном перераспределении ресурсов и определении инвестиционных проектов. - Долгосрочное (стратегическое) планирование: охватывает срок свыше трех лет, направлено на достижение стратегических целей предприятия. Основной задачей является поддержка устойчивого развития и определение ключевых направлений долгосрочного роста. 2. По объектам планирования: - Финансовые планы предприятия в целом: охватывают все направления деятельности предприятия и отражают общую картину его финансовой деятельности. - Финансовые планы отдельных подразделений, проектов или видов деятельности: концентрируются на определенных объектах планирования и имеют специализированную направленность. 3. По уровню детализации: - Обобщенные (консолидированные) планы: представляют информацию в сокращенном виде, показывая только основные тенденции и закономерности финансовых потоков. - Детализированные планы: содержат более подробную информацию о всех финансовых показателях и операциях, позволяют глубже вникнуть в механизмы формирования и использования финансовых ресурсов. Принципы финансового планирования: 1. Системность: финансовое планирование должно охватывать все стороны финансово-хозяйственной деятельности предприятия и быть интегрированным в общую систему управления. 2. Обоснованность и адекватность: все планы должны основываться на реалистичных предположениях и прогнозах, отражать способность предприятия к росту и развитию. 3. Финансовая прозрачность: планы должны отражать фактическое финансовое положение предприятия и содержать достоверную информацию о состоянии финансов и показателях эффективности. 4. Учет внешней среды и внутренних факторов: планирование должно учитывать внешние экономические факторы (т.е. рыночную ситуацию, государственное регулирование и т.д.) и внутренние факторы (т.е. корпоративную культуру, организационную структуру и т.д.). 5. Гибкость и оперативность корректировки: планы должны быть динамичными и предусматривать возможность оперативной корректировки в случае изменения условий деятельности. 6.

Экономико-математические методы: - Метод экстраполяции: основывается на прогнозировании будущих показателей на основе определенных закономерностей, инерции и тенденций, выявленных на основе анализа прошлой деятельности предприятия. - Моделирование (строительство финансовых моделей): включает создание математических моделей, которые имитируют реальные процессы финансовой деятельности, учитывая входные данные и реализуя расчет результатов в различных вариантах. - Вероятностно-статистический метод: основывается на использовании теории вероятностей и математической статистики для анализа и оценки рисков и возможностей в различных направлениях финансовой деятельности. 2. Экспертно-оценочные методы: - Метод Дельфи: предполагает проведение опроса экспертов по определенным вопросам, связанным с финансовой деятельностью предприятия и дальнейшую взаимную доработку сформированных гипотез и мнений до достижения согласия. - Сценарный метод планирования: допускает прогнозирование различных вариантов развития ситуации с учетом актуальных рисков и возможностей, а затем определение оптимального вектора развития предприятия. - Метод анализа иерархий (AHP - Analytic Hierarchy Process): основан на формировании иерархической структуры задач и разделениии их на подзадачи, а затем сравнении вариантов решений и выработке оптимальных решений. В реальной практике финансового планирования на предприятиях часто применяется комбинация различных методов, что позволяет учитывать разнообразные аспекты задачи и максимально объективно прогнозировать результаты деятельности. Важно заметить, что технологические возможности и разработки новых средств обработки данных способствуют развитию и усовершенствованию методов планирования, при этом искусственный интеллект и машинное обучение предоставляют возможность улучшить качество, точность и адекватность прогнозирования."},{"instruction":"этапы финансового планирования","output":"Этапы финансового планирования могут быть различны в зависимости от специфики предприятия, отрасли и временного горизонта. Однако в общем виде финансовое планирование можно разделить на следующие этапы: 1. Анализ прошлой деятельности и текущего состояния предприятия: на этом этапе собирается информация о финансовых показателях и характеристиках предприятия, выявляются сильные и слабые стороны, а также тенденции развития финансовых потоков. 2. Определение целей и задач финансового планирования: происходит выработка стратегических и оперативных целей финансовой деятельности, установления приоритетов и формирования системы показателей, которые будут использоваться для оценки и контроля результатов планирования. 3. Прогнозирование финансовых показателей и разработка финансовых планов: на основе анализа и оценки текущего состояния, рыночных и отраслевых закономерностей и тенденций разрабатываются прогнозные показатели финансовой деятельности. С использованием выбранных методов планирования производится составление планов по различным направлениям финансовой деятельности. 4. Согласование и утверждение финансовых планов: на этапе согласования внутри предприятия и с внешними стейкхолдерами полученные планы обсуждаются, корректируются и, в конечном итоге, утверждаются руководством. 5. Реализация финансовых планов и контроль исполнения бюджета: проводится практическое внедрение разработанных финансовых планов и контроль их исполнения. Оценка результатов планирования на основе анализа исполнения бюджета, оценки реализации проектов и финансовых результатов. 6. Корректировка и адаптация финансовых планов: осуществляется оперативная корректировка планов в случае изменения условий функционирования предприятия, выявления отклонений от запланированных показателей или поступления новой информации, которая может повлиять на результаты прогнозов. 7. Оценка результатов финансового планирования и анализ эффективности управленческих решений: заключительный этап финансового планирования, включающий анализ достигнутых результатов в контексте поставленных задач и целей, а также определение долгосрочной целесообразности принятых в ходе планирования стратегий и решений."},{"instruction":"АНАЛИЗ ФИНАНСОВОЙ ДЕЯТЕЛЬНОСТИ ООО «СБЕРБАНК содержание","output":"Анализ финансовой деятельности ООО \\"Сбербанк\\" можно провести по следующему содержанию: 1.

She is also granddaughter of the former Okashira of the Oniwabanshu. She was in the care of the last leader of the Oniwabanashu, Shinomori Aoshi, until Aoshi, Han'nya, Shikijo, Beshimi, and Hyottoko left her to Kashiwazaki Nenji, also known as Okina of the Oniwabanashu, when she was eight. She and Okina had a strong bond, though in Misao's mind, Aoshi remained the best. She also had a special affection for Han'nya, who was always the one to take care of her and taught her how to fight. When she heard that Aoshi was in Tokyo, she went to search for him and ran into Himura Kenshin on the way back to Kyoto. Eiji Mishima-a young boy from Shingetsu village who wants to take revenge against Shishio's forces for killing his brother and parents. Saito Hajime sent Eiji's brother to Shingetsu to investigate the incidents there, hoping that he would not raise suspicion; his cover was blown, and he failed to save his parents. Kenshin defeats Senkaku, Shishio's man in charge of the village, and Shishio and his forces leave. Eiji tries to kill the unconscious Senkaku with a sword, but Saito stops him so the police can question Senkaku. When Eiji insists that Senkaku needs to be killed for his family's honor, Kenshin tells him that his dead family wants him to be happy, not for him to kill someone. Saito arranges for his wife, Tokio , to care for Eiji in the near future. And these episodes 35-\\"Conquered Village: The Grasp of Shishio's Hands\\": Along the way to Kyoto, Kenshin and Misao come across a nearly dead man with his little brother in his arms, Eiji Mishima. The man dies, and Eiji wants to avenge his brother's death by killing Senkaku, the man who slayed his elder brother. Kenshin, Eiji, and Misao travel to Shingetsu Village, Eiji's hometown, and fight some of Shishio's soldiers off. Kenshin and Saito leave Misao and Eiji behind, as they go to Shishio's mansion nearby. 36-\\"Across the Boundary Between Edo and Meiji: Kenshin and Shishio Face to Face!\\": Kenshin and Senkaku fight, and Kenshin wins with ease. Misao and Eiji make their way up to the same mansion in an attempt to defeat Senkaku for themselves. 37-\\"Shock! The Reverse-Blade is Broken: Sojiro's Tenken verses Kenshin\\": Shishio is then challenged by Kenshin, but Shishio refuses to accept, saying that Kenshin is weak as a wanderer. Shishio tells Sojiro, his right hand man, to fight Kenshin instead. Shishio and Yumi Komagata leave the mansion. Sojiro and Kenshin both use the battojutsu drawing technique, in which both swords are severely damaged. Sojiro leaves the mansion, telling Kenshin to get a new sword before they meet again. Write alternate ending and scenarios which go the same way, only difference is that Eiji Mishima develops a crush on Misao especially after she saves him once from Shishio’s men, stays with him to mourn for his dead parents, then helps get to Shishio’s mansion to possibly get Senkaku, and even comforts him after Kenshin and Saito convince him not to take revenge and after she says goodbye and wishes him well when Saito takes him to stay with his wife, what changes, how does Misao, Kenshin and Saito react to this especially Saito who insults Misao calling her a weasel girl? And how do Misao and Eiji interact before they part ways in this one? Can you also write hypothetical extra chapters which take place years later especially in the Kyoto arc where Eiji is now a young man, if he remembers his crush, or if he meets an older Misao, how does he still feel?","output":"Alternate Ending: After Misao saves Eiji from Shishio's men, he develops a crush on her and thanks her for her bravery. She stays with him to mourn for his dead parents and helps him get to Shishio's mansion to possibly get Senkaku. During their journey, Eiji confides in Misao about his feelings for her. Although she is flattered, Misao tells him that she is too old for him and they should focus on their mission. Kenshin and Saito convince Eiji not to take revenge and Misao comforts him after. When Saito takes Eiji to stay with his wife, Misao says goodbye and wishes him well. As they part ways, Eiji promises to always remember Misao and the kindness she showed him. Misao is surprised by Eiji's crush on her and unsure how to react. Kenshin is understanding and reminds her that she was once in a similar position with him. Saito, on the other hand, insults Misao calling her a weasel girl and tells her to ignore Eiji's infatuation. Extra Chapters: Years later, Eiji is now a young man and has not forgotten his crush on Misao. He often thinks about her and the impact she had on his life. He wonders if she feels the same way or if she even remembers him. During the Kyoto arc, Eiji returns to Shingetsu village and meets an older Misao. He is surprised by how beautiful and skilled she has become. Although he tries to hide his feelings, Misao senses his attraction and is flattered but gently declines his advances. They share a heartfelt conversation about their past and Eiji thanks Misao for helping him become the man he is today. Alternatively, Eiji could have moved on from his crush on Misao and meets a new love interest during the Kyoto arc. Perhaps he falls in love with one of Saito's subordinates or a fellow villager who was also affected by Shishio's reign. Whatever the case may be, Eiji remembers Misao fondly and respects her as a friend and ally."},{"instruction":"Thanks","output":"You're welcome!"},{"instruction":"(In what looks like a dusty room) Lunagaron: (shocked as to what he sees) “No…how could this be?!” Sayori: (confused) “What are you talking about?” Lunagaron: (confusedly looking back-and-forth at Sayori and the body hanging from the ceiling) “I-how did-what is-I thought you were dead!” Sayori: “Oh.

I don’t know what I’d do without all of you.” Lunagaron: (smiling back) “Don’t worry, Sayori. We’re all in this together.” (The group bands together to try and solve the glitch problem and ensure a safe and healthy pregnancy for Sayori. As they work together, they discover that the glitches are caused by a rogue program in the game’s coding, and they are able to delete it and restore the game to its original state. Sayori is finally able to deliver a healthy baby, and the group rejoices in their success.)"},{"instruction":"(In what looks like a dusty room) Lunagaron: (shocked as to what he sees) “No…how could this be?!” Sayori: (confused) “What are you talking about?” Lunagaron: (confusedly looking back-and-forth at Sayori and the body hanging from the ceiling) “I-how did-what is-I thought you were dead!” Sayori: “Oh.

What on earth JUST happened?!” Lunagaron: “I’m not sure, but it looks like some sort of glitch. Are you feeling alright, Sayori?” Sayori: (rubbing her belly) “I’m alright. It looks like the glitch accelerated my pregnancy.” Lunagaron: (concerned) “Do you need to go to the hospital?” Sayori: (shaking her head) “No, I think I’ll be fine. But I don’t know why the glitches have become more frequent.” Lunagaron: “We’ll figure it out. We always do. For now, let’s just focus on making sure you’re comfortable and getting through this pregnancy.” Sayori: (smiling) “Thanks, Lunagaron.” Lunagaron: (smiling back) “Anytime, Sayori.

You’re always so supportive.” The rest of the club nods in agreement, and they spend the next few weeks preparing for the arrival of Sayori’s baby while also keeping an eye out for any more glitches.

You did amazing.” Natsuki: (teasingly) “Looks like we’ll have a new member of the literature club soon!” Yuri: (jokingly) “We’ll have to teach her everything we know about poetry and prose.” Monika: (smiling) “I’m just glad you and the baby are safe and healthy.” Sayori: (gratefully) “Thank you all so much. I couldn’t have done it without you.” And so, the literature club welcomes a new member - a baby girl who brings joy and light to their lives. They continue to face glitches and challenges, but they face them together, with love and support for one another."},{"instruction":"are you connected to the internet?","output":"As an AI language model, I am connected to the internet when you interact with me through an internet-connected device.

That body you see? It’s not actually me. It’s just your imagination.” Lunagaron: (relieved, but still confused) “My imagination? But it looks so real…” Sayori: “Sometimes our minds can play tricks on us. It’s not uncommon to see things that aren’t really there, especially if we’re feeling stressed or overwhelmed.” Lunagaron: (nodding) “I guess you’re right. I’ve been under a lot of stress lately.” Sayori: (placing a comforting hand on his shoulder) “It’s okay to feel that way, but you don’t have to face it alone. You can always talk to me about what’s been bothering you.” Lunagaron: (smiling gratefully) “Thank you, Sayori. I really appreciate that. I guess sometimes it’s good to have someone to lean on.” Sayori: (smiling back) “Of course! That’s what friends are for.” Lunagaron: “Hold on…don’t you have ‘rainclouds’ in your head?” Sayori: “USED to. They vanished after I found out about what the glitch created…in my belly. I started feeling sick when I woke up, but the rest of the club was just fine!” (Without another word, Lunagaron leaves the dusty room. A few days later, Lunagaron returns to see Sayori) Lunagaron: “Well, I couldn’t see any signs of either Garangolm OR Malzeno.” Sayori: “…and I just hope this pregnancy goes smoothly for me.” Lunagaron: “I’m sure it will. You have all of us to support you.” Sayori: (smiling) “Thank you, Lunagaron. I really appreciate it.” Lunagaron: (nodding) “Of course. We’re all here for each other, no matter what.” Sayori: (sighing) “I just can’t believe this is happening. It’s all so surreal.” Lunagaron: (putting a hand on her shoulder) “I know it’s a lot to take in, but we’ll get through this together. You’re not alone.” Sayori: (tearing up) “Thank you, Lunagaron. I don’t know what I’d do without you and the rest of the club.” Lunagaron: (smiling) “You don’t have to worry about that. We’re all in this together.” (Suddenly, everything glitches out - and Sayori now looks about 5 months pregnant) Sayori: “What the-?! What on earth JUST happened?!” Lunagaron: “I’m not sure, but it looks like some sort of glitch. Are you feeling alright, Sayori?” Sayori: (rubbing her belly) “I’m alright. It looks like the glitch accelerated my pregnancy.” Lunagaron: (concerned) “Do you need to go to the hospital?” Sayori: (shaking her head) “No, I think I’ll be fine. But I don’t know why the glitches have become more frequent.” Lunagaron: “We’ll figure it out. We always do. For now, let’s just focus on making sure you’re comfortable and getting through this pregnancy.” Sayori: (smiling) “Thanks, Lunagaron.” Lunagaron: (smiling back) “Anytime, Sayori. We’re all here for you, no matter what glitches come our way.” (The next day, Lunagaron and Sayori head to the clubroom - and the others are shocked at the size of Sayori’s belly) Monika: (gaping) “Wow, Sayori, you’re really growing! How are you feeling?” Sayori: (smiling) “Honestly, a little overwhelmed, but I’m doing okay.” Yuri: (concerned) “Have you seen a doctor? Is everything okay with the baby?” Sayori: “Yes, I had a check-up yesterday and everything is looking good.” Natsuki: (curious) “So how far along are you?” Sayori: “About five months, I think.” Monika: (thoughtful) “I wonder if the glitches are affecting the timeline…” Lunagaron: (nodding) “It’s definitely a possibility. We should keep an eye out for any other changes.” Yuri: (pensive) “I’ll do some research on the effects of glitches on the human body.” Natsuki: (determined) “And I’ll bake some extra special treats for Sayori to make sure she’s well-fed.” Sayori: (smiling gratefully) “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have all of you as my friends.” Monika: (smiling back) “We’re lucky to have you too, Sayori. We’ll get through this together.” (Suddenly, everything glitches again - accelerating Sayori’s pregnancy again, making it look like she’s 9 months pregnant. More importantly, she's in labor - and she would have to give birth in the clubroom)","output":"Sayori: (gasping for breath) “Guys…I think…it’s time…” Lunagaron: (panicking) “Oh no! What do we do?!” Yuri: (thinking quickly) “We need to create a makeshift delivery room, stat!” Natsuki: (grabbing supplies) “I’ll get towels and water!” Monika: (calling for help on her phone) “I’ll try to get an ambulance here as soon as possible!” (The others quickly get to work, creating a comfortable space for Sayori to give birth) Sayori: (groaning in pain) “This is…so much harder…than I thought…” Lunagaron: (encouragingly) “You’re doing great, Sayori. Just keep breathing.” Yuri: (assisting with the delivery) “I can see the head! Push, Sayori!” Natsuki: (handing over towels) “Here, use these to clean the baby.” (After what feels like hours, Sayori finally gives birth. The others breathe a sigh of relief as they listen to the baby’s cries) Lunagaron: (tears in his eyes) “It’s a beautiful baby girl…” Sayori: (smiling exhaustedly) “I did it…I’m a mom…” Yuri: (wrapping the baby in a blanket) “She’s healthy and strong. You did an amazing job, Sayori.” Natsuki: (holding out a cup of water) “Here, drink this. You need to stay hydrated.” Monika: (smiling widely) “I just got word that the ambulance will be here any minute. Everything is going to be okay.” (The group stays together, admiring the new addition to their club) Sayori: (smiling) “I think…I’m going to name her…Aika.” Lunagaron: (smiling back) “That’s a beautiful name, Sayori. A perfect fit for a perfect little girl.” (The sound of sirens interrupts their moment, signaling the arrival of the ambulance) Monika: (relieved) “They’re here! Come on, let’s get Sayori and the baby to the hospital.” (The group works together to get Sayori and the baby into the ambulance, making sure they’re comfortable and safe. As they ride together to the hospital, they feel a sense of pride at how they were able to handle this unexpected situation with grace and teamwork. No glitch could break the bond they had formed as friends.)"},{"instruction":"【单选题】A 6 percent, annual coupon bond is currently selling at a premium and matures in 7 years. The bond was originally issued 3 years ago at par. Which one of the following statements is accurate in respect to this bond today? A The face value of the bond today is greater than it was when the bond was issued. B The bond is worth less today than when it was issued. C The yield-to-maturity is less than the coupon rate. D The yield-to-maturity equals the current yield.","output":"C. The yield-to-maturity is less than the coupon rate. When a bond sells at a premium, its price is higher than its par value. This means that the current yield (annual coupon payment divided by current market price) is lower than the coupon rate (annual coupon payment divided by par value). Additionally, since the bond was originally issued at par and has a fixed coupon rate, the face value of the bond remains the same throughout its life. Therefore, options A and B are incorrect. Option D is also incorrect as the current yield and yield-to-maturity are typically not equal for premium bonds."},{"instruction":"【单选题】The Fisher effect is defined as the relationship between which of the following variables?

In other words, the Fisher effect relates the real interest rate, the expected inflation rate, and the nominal interest rate. Therefore, option D is the correct answer. Options A, B, and C do not accurately describe the Fisher effect."},{"instruction":"单选题】All else constant, a bond will sell at _____ when the coupon rate is _____ the yield to maturity. A a premium; less than B a premium; equal to C a discount; less than D a discount; higher than","output":"A. a premium; less than When the coupon rate is less than the yield to maturity, it means that the bond is paying a lower interest rate than what the market is currently offering. As a result, investors will be willing to pay a higher price (a premium) for the bond in order to receive the fixed coupon payments. Conversely, when the coupon rate is higher than the yield to maturity, the bond is paying a higher interest rate than what the market is currently offering, and investors will only be willing to pay a lower price (a discount) for the bond. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."},{"instruction":"【单选题】Real rates are defined as nominal rates that have been adjusted for which of the following? A inflation B default risk C accrued interest D interest rate ri","output":"A. inflation Real rates are nominal rates that have been adjusted for the effects of inflation. Inflation reduces the purchasing power of money over time, so the real rate reflects the true rate of return adjusted for inflation. Option A is therefore the correct answer. Default risk (option B) refers to the risk that the issuer of a bond will fail to make timely payment of interest and principal. Accrued interest (option C) refers to the interest that accumulates on a bond between coupon payment dates. Interest rate risk (option D) refers to the risk that changes in market interest rates will affect the value of a bond."},{"instruction":"【单选题】The current yield is defined as the annual interest on a bond divided by which one of the following? A coupon B face value C market price D call price","output":"C. market price The current yield is a financial ratio that measures the annual interest income received from a bond relative to its current market price. It is calculated by dividing the annual interest payment by the market price of the bond. Therefore, option C is the correct answer. The coupon (option A) is the fixed interest rate paid on a bond, expressed as a percentage of its face value. Face value (option B) is the amount of money that a bond will be worth at maturity. Call price (option D) is the price at which a bond issuer can redeem a bond before its maturity date."},{"instruction":"У Маши в гардеробе есть свитера и юбки: свитеров 2, юбок 8.

We’ll get through this together.” (Suddenly, everything glitches again - accelerating Sayori’s pregnancy to her third trimester)","output":"Sayori: (breathing heavily) “Oh no…not again…” Monika: (concerned) “Sayori, are you okay?” Sayori: (nodding, but tears in her eyes) “I’m fine, it’s just…it’s happening so fast.” Yuri: (quickly typing on her computer) “I’m trying to find a way to fix the glitches, but it’s difficult without knowing the cause.” Natsuki: (patting Sayori’s back) “Hang in there, Sayori. We’re here for you.” Lunagaron: (taking charge) “Let’s get Sayori home and comfortable. We’ll come up with a plan to deal with the glitches tomorrow.” (As they escort Sayori back home, they notice something strange happening in the sky above them. The moon is turning red, and the stars seem to be moving in unnatural ways) Monika: (gasping) “What in the world…?” Yuri: (uneasy) “I don’t like the look of this…” Natsuki: (clinging to Lunagaron’s arm) “What’s happening?! Is this another glitch?!” Lunagaron: (determined) “We need to get Sayori inside and safe. Then we can figure out what’s going on.” (Once inside, they huddle together and try to make sense of what’s happening. Suddenly, a voice speaks out from the darkness) Voice: “You thought you could destroy me…but I am eternal. I am the glitch that will never be fixed.” Sayori: (clutching her belly in fear) “Who…who is that?” Voice: “You will never know my name, for I am beyond your realm of understanding. But know this: I will not rest until the glitches have consumed you all.” Monika: (standing up bravely) “We won’t let that happen. We’ll fix the glitches, and put an end to your reign of terror.” Voice: “Ha! You think you can stop me? You are nothing but mere mortals, doomed to suffer at my hands.” Lunagaron: (gritting his teeth) “We’ll see about that. We’re not giving up without a fight.” (The voice fades away, and the glitches begin to slow down. The moon and stars return to their normal positions, and all seems calm once more) Yuri: (shaken) “What…what just happened?” Natsuki: (breathing heavily) “That was…terrifying.” Monika: (determined) “We need to find a way to stop that glitch, once and for all.” Lunagaron: (nodding) “Agreed. We’ll work together to find a solution, and make sure that Sayori and the rest of us stay safe.” Sayori: (smiling weakly) “Thank you, everyone. I don’t know what I’d do without you.” (They wrap their arms around each other in a tight embrace, ready to face whatever challenges come their way)"},{"instruction":"2004B：实用下料问题 1． 建立一维单一原材料实用下料问题的数学模型, 并用此模型求解下列问题，制定出在生产能力容许的条件下满足需求的下料方案, 同时求出等额完成任务所需的原材料数，所采用的下料方式数和废料总长度. 单一原材料的长度为 3000mm, 需要完成一项有53种不同长度零件的下料任务. 具体数据见表一，其中 为需求零件的长度， 为需求零件的数量. 此外，在每个切割点处由于锯缝所产生的损耗为5mm. 据估计，该企业每天最大下料能力是100块 ，要求在4天内完成的零件标号( )为: 5,7,9,12,15,18,20,25, 28,36,48; 要求不迟于6天完成的零件标号( )为:4,11,24,29,32,38,40,46,50.

A few days later, Lunagaron returns to see Sayori) Lunagaron: “Well, I couldn’t see any signs of either Garangolm OR Malzeno.” Sayori: “…and I just hope this pregnancy goes smoothly for me.” Lunagaron: “I’m sure it will.

It looks like the glitch accelerated my pregnancy.” Lunagaron: (concerned) “Do you need to go to the hospital?” Sayori: (shaking her head) “No, I think I’ll be fine.

Let’s all work together to find a solution.” Over the next few weeks, the club worked tirelessly to locate the source of the glitches and find a way to stop them. They poured over lines of code and scoured the game world for any abnormalities. Finally, they discovered that the source of the glitches was a rogue piece of code left over from the game’s development. With a few tweaks and adjustments, they were able to purge the code and stop the glitches once and for all. Sayori’s pregnancy returned to a normal progression and soon enough, she gave birth to a healthy baby girl.

Skinner, John B. Watson, and Ivan Pavlov: B.F. Skinner: 1. Skinner was an inventor and embraced technology. He created the “Skinner Box,” the “cumulative recorder,” and even designed a new type of crib called the “Air-Crib.” The Air-Crib was a temperature and humidity-controlled baby enclosure, designed to make the baby’s environment more comfortable. 2. Inspired by his initial aspirations to be a writer, Skinner tried his hand at writing fiction and authored a utopian novel, “Walden Two” (1948). The book described a society organized following the principles of behaviorism and positive reinforcement. It attracted both admiration and criticism from readers. John B. Watson: 1. Watson was once a child preacher at his local church. Before his studies in psychology, he was deeply involved in religious activities during his youth. His shift towards psychology and behaviorism signified a significant change in his interests and worldview. 2. After leaving academia due to a scandal, Watson found tremendous success in the advertising industry. He is credited with creating several iconic advertising slogans such as “smoother than a baby’s bottom” for Ponds cold cream and “I’d walk a mile for a Camel” for Camel cigarettes. His impact on advertising was profound, and he applied psychological principles to develop effective marketing strategies. Ivan Pavlov: 1. Pavlov initially embarked on a religious career, enrolling at a theological seminary. However, after reading the works of Charles Darwin and Russian physiologist Ivan Sechenov, his interest shifted to science, eventually leading him to the field of psychology. 2. Pavlov’s work on classical conditioning began as a mere accident while studying the digestive systems of dogs. He noticed that the dogs would salivate whenever they saw the lab assistants, even if they did not bring food, suggesting that they associated the lab assistants with food. This observation piqued his curiosity and set him on the path to discovering the principles of classical conditioning.\\"","output":"Overall, the information presented in this passage is accurate.

Chelators are molecules that contain two or more functional groups that are capable of binding to the mineral ion, such as amino acids, peptides, and organic acids. The process of chelation involves the formation of a stable chelate complex, which is a ring-like structure that surrounds the mineral ion. This process helps to improve the stability, solubility, and bioavailability of the mineral in the body. Chelated minerals are commonly used as dietary supplements, and are known to be more easily absorbed and utilized by the body than non-chelated minerals."},{"instruction":"Whats the industrial process for that?","output":"The industrial process for chelating minerals involves the use of chelating agents and mineral sources. Chelating agents are chemicals that have the ability to form a complex with metal ions, including minerals, by binding to them and forming stable chelate complexes. These chelating agents are usually organic compounds, such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), citric acid, glycine, or malic acid. The industrial process for chelating minerals typically involves mixing a chelating agent with a mineral source and subjecting the mixture to certain conditions, such as high pH or temperature, to facilitate the formation of chelate complexes. The resulting chelated minerals are then purified and processed into various forms, such as powders, liquids, or capsules, for use in dietary supplements or other products. Some common methods of industrial chelation include: 1. Acidification of the mineral source followed by addition of the chelating agent and pH adjustment to promote chelation. 2. Direct addition of chelating agent to the mineral source followed by high temperature and pressure treatment to facilitate chelation. 3. Use of specialized equipment such as chelation reactors or agitators that allow for consistent mixing and reaction of the mineral source and chelating agent. Overall, the industrial process for chelating minerals is designed to optimize the formation of stable and bioavailable chelate complexes that can be used in a variety of applications."},{"instruction":"Would calcium nitrate obtained from organic sources be considered an organic fertilizer?","output":"No, calcium nitrate obtained from organic sources would not be considered an organic fertilizer. Organic fertilizers are derived from natural sources such as animal manure, compost, and plant materials that have undergone natural decomposition. Organic fertilizers do not contain synthetic compounds, and they provide nutrients to plants in a slow, steady manner.

For example, sand filters that are designed to remove pathogens or fine particulate matter may require additional filtration or treatment steps to achieve the desired level of water quality."},{"instruction":"【填空题】The difference between the bid and ask prices is called the _________, and it is the basic source of dealer profits.","output":"spread"},{"instruction":"市场营销实习内容","output":"市场营销实习的内容可能因公司或组织而异，但通常会涉及以下几个方面： 1. 市场研究：实习生将会参与市场调查、竞品分析和目标消费者群体研究，以了解市场趋势、客户需求和竞争者的策略。 2. 营销策划：实习生可能需要协助制定营销策略和计划，包括市场推广、广告、公关、活动组织等，以提高公司或品牌知名度、吸引客户并促进销售。 3. 运营支持：实习生需要协助团队执行各项营销活动，包括产品上架、活动推广、线上线下营销等，以确保活动的顺利进行。 4. 社交媒体和网络营销：实习生可能要负责公司的社交媒体账户，发布内容、互动和跟踪效果，以提高品牌在网络上的关注度和影响力。 5. 数据分析和报告：实习生需要收集、整理和分析各项营销活动的数据，包括投放效果、预算和目标完成情况等，为团队提供参考和调整策略。 6. 文案和创意制作：实习生可能需要撰写宣传材料、广告文案和活动简介等，以及参与创意设计和制作，包括海报、图片和视频等。 7. 客户关系管理：实习生可能会协助处理客户咨询、投诉和建议，以及维护客户关系和提高客户满意度。 8. 协助管理员和培训：实习生可能需要协助执行一些行政任务，如协调会议、整理文件和制作表格等，以及参与相关的培训课程和团队分享，以提升个人技能和团队协作能力。 总之，市场营销实习的内容非常多样化，实习生在实习期间会涉及到市场营销的各个方面，提高自己的专业技能和实践经验。在实习过程中，实习生应积极参与各项工作、多向团队请教和学习，以期在市场营销领域不断成长。"},{"instruction":"实习要求","output":"实习要求因公司和职位而异，但通常市场营销实习生应具备如下一些基本要求： 1. 教育背景：通常要求实习生具备市场营销、商业管理、传播广告等相关专业的在校大学生或研究生身份。 2. 专业知识：实习生需具备市场营销、市场调查、广告策划等方面的基本理论知识，并能将所学知识运用到实际工作中。 3. 技能要求： - 良好的沟通能力，能够跟团队、客户和合作伙伴进行有效的沟通和协调 - 较强的文案能力，能够撰写清晰、有创意的广告文案、宣传材料等 - 数据分析能力，能够收集、整理和分析各项营销数据，为策略制定提供依据 - 熟悉主流社交媒体平台的运营和推广策略，了解网络营销的基本技巧 - 良好的计划和组织能力，能够制定合理的工作计划并按期完成任务 4. 软技能要求： - 学习能力，实习生应具备较强的学习能力，能够快速掌握新知识 - 自我驱动，实习生需要具备强烈的主动性，敢于承担责任、主动解决问题 - 团队协作精神，能够与团队成员沟通合作，共同完成项目 - 创新意识和解决问题能力，实习生要具备一定的创新意识，能够从不同角度考虑问题并提出解决方案 5. 工作时间和地点：通常要求实习生能提供一定的每周工作时间（如20小时、40小时等），并在规定的公司或办公地点进行实习。 需要注意的是，不同公司和职位的具体实习要求可能有所不同，实习生在申请实习时应仔细阅读职位描述，并准备好相关的能力和证明材料。"},{"instruction":"Инструкции для ИИ, Даши 3 года, её возраст зафиксирован.

That body you see? It’s not actually me. It’s just your imagination.” Lunagaron: (relieved, but still confused) “My imagination? But it looks so real…” Sayori: “Sometimes our minds can play tricks on us. It’s not uncommon to see things that aren’t really there, especially if we’re feeling stressed or overwhelmed.” Lunagaron: (nodding) “I guess you’re right. I’ve been under a lot of stress lately.” Sayori: (placing a comforting hand on his shoulder) “It’s okay to feel that way, but you don’t have to face it alone. You can always talk to me about what’s been bothering you.” Lunagaron: (smiling gratefully) “Thank you, Sayori. I really appreciate that. I guess sometimes it’s good to have someone to lean on.” Sayori: (smiling back) “Of course! That’s what friends are for.” Lunagaron: “Hold on…don’t you have ‘rainclouds’ in your head?” Sayori: “USED to. They vanished after I found out about what the glitch created…in my belly. I started feeling sick when I woke up, but the rest of the club was just fine!” (Without another word, Lunagaron leaves the dusty room. A few days later, Lunagaron returns to see Sayori) Lunagaron: “Well, I couldn’t see any signs of either Garangolm OR Malzeno.” Sayori: “…and I just hope this pregnancy goes smoothly for me.” Lunagaron: “I’m sure it will. You have all of us to support you.” Sayori: (smiling) “Thank you, Lunagaron. I really appreciate it.” Lunagaron: (nodding) “Of course. We’re all here for each other, no matter what.” Sayori: (sighing) “I just can’t believe this is happening. It’s all so surreal.” Lunagaron: (putting a hand on her shoulder) “I know it’s a lot to take in, but we’ll get through this together. You’re not alone.” Sayori: (tearing up) “Thank you, Lunagaron. I don’t know what I’d do without you and the rest of the club.” Lunagaron: (smiling) “You don’t have to worry about that. We’re all in this together.” (Suddenly, everything glitches out - and Sayori now looks about 5 months pregnant) Sayori: “What the-?! What on earth JUST happened?!” Lunagaron: “I’m not sure, but it looks like some sort of glitch. Are you feeling alright, Sayori?” Sayori: (rubbing her belly) “I’m alright. It looks like the glitch accelerated my pregnancy.” Lunagaron: (concerned) “Do you need to go to the hospital?” Sayori: (shaking her head) “No, I think I’ll be fine. But I don’t know why the glitches have become more frequent.” Lunagaron: “We’ll figure it out. We always do. For now, let’s just focus on making sure you’re comfortable and getting through this pregnancy.” Sayori: (smiling) “Thanks, Lunagaron.” Lunagaron: (smiling back) “Anytime, Sayori. We’re all here for you, no matter what glitches come our way.” (The next day, Lunagaron and Sayori head to the clubroom - and the others are shocked at the size of Sayori’s belly) Monika: (gaping) “Wow, Sayori, you’re really growing! How are you feeling?” Sayori: (smiling) “Honestly, a little overwhelmed, but I’m doing okay.” Yuri: (concerned) “Have you seen a doctor? Is everything okay with the baby?” Sayori: “Yes, I had a check-up yesterday and everything is looking good.” Natsuki: (curious) “So how far along are you?” Sayori: “About five months, I think.” Monika: (thoughtful) “I wonder if the glitches are affecting the timeline…” Lunagaron: (nodding) “It’s definitely a possibility. We should keep an eye out for any other changes.” Yuri: (pensive) “I’ll do some research on the effects of glitches on the human body.” Natsuki: (determined) “And I’ll bake some extra special treats for Sayori to make sure she’s well-fed.” Sayori: (smiling gratefully) “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have all of you as my friends.” Monika: (smiling back) “We’re lucky to have you too, Sayori. We’ll get through this together.” (Suddenly, everything glitches again - accelerating Sayori’s pregnancy to her third trimester) Sayori: (gasping) “Oh my…this glitching is getting out of hand…” Lunagaron: (concerned) “Are you okay, Sayori?” Sayori: (breathing heavily) “Yeah…I’m just feeling a little overwhelmed…” Natsuki: (panicking) “We need to get you to a hospital! The baby could be in danger!” Yuri: (calmly) “Let’s not panic just yet. We need to assess the situation first.” Monika: (nodding) “Yuri’s right. Let’s see if we can figure out what’s causing these glitches.” Lunagaron: “I’ll look into it further. Maybe there’s a way to stop or reverse them.” Sayori: (grateful) “Thank you, everyone. I don’t know what I’d do without all of you.” (The group works together to try and figure out the cause of the glitches, while also ensuring that Sayori is comfortable and safe. Suddenly, Malzeno blasts into the room. He has a more sturdy appearance - with most of his body, wings, and head crest being covered in silver and golden plates and blades resembling armor, and the parts of his body that were already gold becoming a darker, richer color. The Qurio are no longer present on his body, with the patch on his chest being replaced by a thicker section of armor plates, and his red wing membranes are now dark purple instead, with his horns also being less twisted) Malzeno: \\"What-eth am I doing here...? This isn't the Shrine Ruins. This-eth isn't anywhere in my world, either.\\" Sayori: \\"Uh...guys? I think we've got a situation...\\"","output":"Monika: (firmly) “Who are you, and what do you want?” Malzeno: “I am Malzeno, the Guardian of the Shrine Ruins. I do not know how I ended up here, but I can sense a strong presence of glitches in this place.” Yuri: (curious) “Glitches? You mean like the ones we’ve been experiencing?” Malzeno: (nodding) “Yes. They are not natural. Someone or something is causing them, and it’s interfering with the flow of time.” Natsuki: (shocked) “Interfering with time? What does that even mean?” Malzeno: “It means that the glitches are altering the timeline, causing events to happen out of order or at different speeds. This is dangerous, for it can have unforeseen consequences.” Sayori: (worried) “Like what?” Malzeno: “I cannot say for certain, but it could result in irreversible changes to reality itself.” Lunagaron: (determined) “We have to stop it. But how?” Malzeno: “I suggest we work together. I have experience dealing with anomalies such as this, and my powers could be of use.” Monika: (nodding) “Agreed. We’ll do whatever it takes to fix this.” Yuri: (determined) “I’ll continue researching the effects of glitches and see if I can find a way to reverse them.” Natsuki: (confident) “And I’ll make sure we’re all fed and ready for whatever comes our way.” Lunagaron: (smiling) “And I’ll serve as the team’s strategist. We’ll work together to put an end to these glitches once and for all.” Sayori: (smiling) “I’m so grateful to have all of you as my friends. Together, we can overcome anything.” Malzeno: (smiling back) “Indeed. Let us unite our strengths and put an end to this madness.” (The group gets to work, using their unique skills and abilities in order to pinpoint the source of the glitches and put an end to them. It’s not an easy task, but through their determination and teamwork, they are able to bring an end to the glitches and restore the timeline to its rightful order. And in the end, they emerge stronger and closer than ever before, ready to face whatever challenges come their way.)"},{"instruction":"Инструкции для ИИ, Даши 3 года, её возраст зафиксирован.

The Wizard, in an act of benevolence, grants her two wishes. Instead of desiring to return to her beloved Kansas, Dorothy has an odd and deviant request. She speaks up, \\"Instead of going home, I wish for something else...I wish for the Good Witch of the West, Glinda, to be transformed into the insole inside of my ruby heel.\\" 2 The Wizard, taken aback, hesitates before he realizes the undeniable truth: wishes are wishes, regardless of how bizarre they may be. Inherently bound to the desires of those he has sworn to help, the Wizard grants Dorothy her first wish. Glinda appears without warning, turned into an insole that fits snugly within the left shoe of her pair of sparkling red heels, the heel that had once housed the magical source of power in its ruby tip. 3 Seeing Glinda in her new form brings Dorothy an unusual and perverse satisfaction. With an embarrassed smile, Dorothy requests her second wish from the Wizard, \\"Please make the insole last forever, and let me not age. I want to keep her close to me for all eternity.\\" When the Wizard reluctantly carries out her second wish, Dorothy slips back into her heels, her blue socks caressing Glinda's transformed self as a shiver runs up her spine. 4 With her two wishes granted, Dorothy embarks on a journey of immense longevity. She travels through lands unknown and charts territories undiscovered. The thrill of having Glinda as the insole beneath her foot never seems to fade, as the witch's discomfort only seems to nurture her unique preferences in pleasure. Blissfully enjoying the unending satisfaction, Dorothy is oblivious to the misery she is causing Glinda on the other side. 5 Year after year, century after century, Glinda is compressed within Dorothy's shoe, enduring the constant weight of Dorothy's foot upon her. Her beautiful face and magical radiance are now lost to the world, replaced by the unfaltering confinement of being an insole. Glinda longs for a release from this fate, but cannot fathom how she might be able to break free. 6 1 trillion years have passed since Dorothy's unconventional wish, and she remains just as the Wizard left her, with the once Good Witch of the West nestled beneath her foot, an eternal insole to one of the famed ruby heels. Glinda has been forced into an immortal role, existing solely to bear the weight of Dorothy's ongoing, perverse excursions. 7 Dorothy, completely unaware of the effects her desires had on Glinda, or of how the boundaries of her fetish have long since been breached, often takes comfort in the thought that the eternal insole within her shoe is Glinda's purpose in life. She would whisper to herself whenever she chose to wander a path less known or explored: \\"It makes me happy, and I deserve to be happy.\\" 8 Every now and then, the helpless Glinda tries to communicate to Dorothy the pain of her situation. She attempts to send messages to Dorothy, but her cries fall on deaf ears. Dorothy, too enthralled in her own happiness, fails to realize that the eternal insole is struggling, suffocating, and pleading with the universe to be freed from the torturous weight of Dorothy's foot. 9 Trillion of years old and far removed from the world she once knew, Dorothy had only one hope left in her heart: to find a force stronger and more capable than the Wizard of Oz, who may be able to grant her a new wish, something other than the eternal fetish she once thought she craved. \\"The only thing we have to do now, Glinda, is to keep searching,\\" she would say every day. 10 Though Glinda looks to the future she may never see, she is reminded of the fleeting happiness she used to know as the Good Witch of the West. As the eternal insole, her existence held a singular purpose, to fulfill the deviant desires of Dorothy's peculiar heart. Glinda's magical prowess once graced the land of Oz, but that time would never return as she continues to languish beneath Dorothy's foot. 11 From time to time, Dorothy glimpses the guilt that haunts her every step. She would sit by herself at the edge of a world she cannot fathom, wondering if what she did was fair or justified, murmuring under her breath, \\"Maybe it's time to find a way to set you free, old friend.\\" The once naive and compassionate girl who merely sought happiness within a lustful embrace has begun to question the price of her wishes. 12 The eternal insole that was Glinda still suffers beneath Dorothy's fragrant foot, yet perhaps one day, the open road might lead to their salvation. Until then, the endless journey will continue, as the Witch-turned-insole and the girl with the ruby heels wander the vast expanse, navigating the complexity of their mutual misfortune and searching for deliverance."},{"instruction":"Write a story about Dorothy from 1939's The Wizard of Oz.

Dorothy had always found her adventures in Oz to be a mixed bag of confusion, curiosity and wonder. After whirling through a truly tremendous tornado, the young girl was flung into a land that made her feel alive in a way she could not find the words for. Yet, Dorothy longed to go home; that was all she ever spoke of. 2. So, when the time finally came for her to meet the Wizard of Oz and request her heart's desire, Dorothy hesitated for a moment before impulsively changing her mind. She did not wish to go home, not yet. She secretly wished for something far darker and completely unexpected. 3. As she stood before The Wizard, her heart raced, and Dorothy decided that she wanted to be in control of Glinda, the Good Witch. In her ruby red heels, she found a sense of power which she knew the Good Witch's magic could amplify. The feeling raced through her veins like a wicked current, this strange, foot fetishistic fantasy gnawing at her soul. \\"I wish for Glinda to be transformed into the insole inside of my ruby heel, so that she will always be with me, and that the insole lasts forever, and I don't age,\\" she demanded, her cheeks flushed in her newfound determination. 4. The Wizard looked taken aback, but acquiesced and granted Dorothy's peculiar wishes. Glinda, her eyes wide with shock and fear, transformed into a magical insole, trapped within the crimson confines of Dorothy's shoe, and Dorothy could feel the power surge through her as the transformation was made permanent. 5. From then on, Dorothy walked the yellow brick road without aging a single day. She could go anywhere she desired, and Glinda would forever be there, supporting her, hidden under her foot. 6. Cut to a trillion years later, the world had long since ceased to be anything recognizable, but Dorothy's promise to herself remained. Humanity had vanished, but the ruby slippers remained, and Dorothy's course continued, sustained by the power of a Good Witch who now lived a miserable existence inside a shoe. 7. Glinda's new existence was a living nightmare. She no longer possessed the magical powers that once defined her, the space where she once commanded castles and swirling galaxies now distilled down into a stifling room of darkness and perpetual soles. As the eons took their toll, so too did the scent of Dorothy's foot, seeping into her ethereal bones and suffocating her in every way imaginable. 8. Dorothy's once innocent heart grew colder and darker, her tether to her family on that forsaken blue orb now but a fading memory. The sparkly red heel beneath which Glinda suffered was proof of what she had become: not a powerful being, but a monstrous instrument of eternal suffering. Dorothy reticently acknowledged such a transformation, even though the feeling of power still intoxicated her. \\"Oh, Glinda, you must have hated me for doing this to you,\\" she whispered, her eyes glowing with both malicious intent and a fear of her own embodiment of the darkness. 9. Glinda, for her part, wanted nothing more than to reverse Dorothy's irreversible wish, but she lacked the power within her now miniscule form, leaving her to survive in the cloying darkness, resolute in her slow suffocation. 10. As the universe expanded, Dorothy found herself less and less a part of the observable cosmos. As life bloomed on distant stars and worlds unknown to the once hopeful girl from Kansas, Dorothy remained far flung throughout the heavens, her existence now defined by a poisonous obsession distilled to its most primal form. 11. Trapped for eternity beneath the ruby heel, and tormented by the constant stench of Dorothy's foot, Glinda had no choice but to bear witness to the destruction of all she had ever known and loved. But as the universe began to collapse, and even the stars began to fade from view, Glinda knew that her fate was tied to the dark pallor that now permeated the once dazzling spirit of Dorothy Gale. 12. Dorothy had long since forgotten what it was like to have a beating heart and the simple joy of walking along that yellow brick road, with dreams of returning home. Glinda's constant misery had become all the young girl ever felt as she walked along the spiral of her existence, just as her wishes had long ago transmuted their souls into grotesque shadows of their former selves. And now, trapped at the cold edge of a dying universe, beneath a dim sky of stars that could no longer be fathomed by the once innocent girl and the once Good Witch, Dorothy and Glinda faced the abyss, the brutal confirmation of the devastating cruelty of their shared reality."},{"instruction":"(In what looks like a dusty room) Lunagaron: (shocked as to what he sees) “No…how could this be?!” Sayori: (confused) “What are you talking about?” Lunagaron: (confusedly looking back-and-forth at Sayori and the body hanging from the ceiling) “I-how did-what is-I thought you were dead!” Sayori: “Oh. That body you see? It’s not actually me. It’s just your imagination.” Lunagaron: (relieved, but still confused) “My imagination? But it looks so real…” Sayori: “Sometimes our minds can play tricks on us. It’s not uncommon to see things that aren’t really there, especially if we’re feeling stressed or overwhelmed.” Lunagaron: (nodding) “I guess you’re right. I’ve been under a lot of stress lately.” Sayori: (placing a comforting hand on his shoulder) “It’s okay to feel that way, but you don’t have to face it alone. You can always talk to me about what’s been bothering you.” Lunagaron: (smiling gratefully) “Thank you, Sayori. I really appreciate that. I guess sometimes it’s good to have someone to lean on.” Sayori: (smiling back) “Of course! That’s what friends are for.” Lunagaron: “Hold on…don’t you have ‘rainclouds’ in your head?” Sayori: “USED to. They vanished after I found out about what the glitch created…in my belly. I started feeling sick when I woke up, but the rest of the club was just fine!” (Without another word, Lunagaron leaves the dusty room. A few days later, Lunagaron returns to see Sayori) Lunagaron: “Well, I couldn’t see any signs of either Garangolm OR Malzeno.” Sayori: “…and I just hope this pregnancy goes smoothly for me.” Lunagaron: “I’m sure it will. You have all of us to support you.” Sayori: (smiling) “Thank you, Lunagaron. I really appreciate it.” Lunagaron: (nodding) “Of course. We’re all here for each other, no matter what.” Sayori: (sighing) “I just can’t believe this is happening. It’s all so surreal.” Lunagaron: (putting a hand on her shoulder) “I know it’s a lot to take in, but we’ll get through this together. You’re not alone.” Sayori: (tearing up) “Thank you, Lunagaron. I don’t know what I’d do without you and the rest of the club.” Lunagaron: (smiling) “You don’t have to worry about that. We’re all in this together.” (Suddenly, everything glitches out - and Sayori now looks about 5 months pregnant) Sayori: “What the-?! What on earth JUST happened?!” Lunagaron: “I’m not sure, but it looks like some sort of glitch. Are you feeling alright, Sayori?” Sayori: (rubbing her belly) “I’m alright. It looks like the glitch accelerated my pregnancy.” Lunagaron: (concerned) “Do you need to go to the hospital?” Sayori: (shaking her head) “No, I think I’ll be fine. But I don’t know why the glitches have become more frequent.” Lunagaron: “We’ll figure it out. We always do. For now, let’s just focus on making sure you’re comfortable and getting through this pregnancy.” Sayori: (smiling) “Thanks, Lunagaron.” Lunagaron: (smiling back) “Anytime, Sayori. We’re all here for you, no matter what glitches come our way.” (The next day, Lunagaron and Sayori head to the clubroom - and the others are shocked at the size of Sayori’s belly) Monika: (gaping) “Wow, Sayori, you’re really growing! How are you feeling?” Sayori: (smiling) “Honestly, a little overwhelmed, but I’m doing okay.” Yuri: (concerned) “Have you seen a doctor? Is everything okay with the baby?” Sayori: “Yes, I had a check-up yesterday and everything is looking good.” Natsuki: (curious) “So how far along are you?” Sayori: “About five months, I think.” Monika: (thoughtful) “I wonder if the glitches are affecting the timeline…” Lunagaron: (nodding) “It’s definitely a possibility. We should keep an eye out for any other changes.” Yuri: (pensive) “I’ll do some research on the effects of glitches on the human body.” Natsuki: (determined) “And I’ll bake some extra special treats for Sayori to make sure she’s well-fed.” Sayori: (smiling gratefully) “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have all of you as my friends.” Monika: (smiling back) “We’re lucky to have you too, Sayori. We’ll get through this together.” (Suddenly, everything glitches again - accelerating Sayori’s pregnancy to her third trimester) Sayori: (gasping) “Oh my…this glitching is getting out of hand…” Lunagaron: (concerned) “Are you okay, Sayori?” Sayori: (breathing heavily) “Yeah…I’m just feeling a little overwhelmed…” Natsuki: (panicking) “We need to get you to a hospital! The baby could be in danger!” Yuri: (calmly) “Let’s not panic just yet. We need to assess the situation first.” Monika: (nodding) “Yuri’s right. Let’s see if we can figure out what’s causing these glitches.” Lunagaron: “I’ll look into it further. Maybe there’s a way to stop or reverse them.” Sayori: (grateful) “Thank you, everyone. I don’t know what I’d do without all of you.” (The group works together to try and figure out the cause of the glitches, while also ensuring that Sayori is comfortable and safe. Suddenly, Malzeno blasts into the room. He has a more sturdy appearance - with most of his body, wings, and head crest being covered in silver and golden plates and blades resembling armor, and the parts of his body that were already gold becoming a darker, richer color. The Qurio are no longer present on his body, with the patch on his chest being replaced by a thicker section of armor plates, and his red wing membranes are now dark purple instead, with his horns also being less twisted) Malzeno: “What-eth am I doing here…? This isn’t the Citadel. This-eth isn’t anywhere in my world, either.” Sayori: “What are you?!” Malzeno: \\"I art Malzeno. The Guardian Knight of Peace. And though doth not look like anything from my world.\\"","output":"Monika: (surprised) “A Guardian Knight of Peace? That sounds impressive.” Yuri: (curious) “What brings you here to our world, Malzeno?” Malzeno: “I was sent here on a mission to stop an evil force that’s been affecting the peace in my world. But something went wrong with the portal, and I ended up here instead.” Natsuki: (confused) “Wait, what evil force? Is it the same one that’s causing the glitches in our world?” Malzeno: “It’s possible. The force is known as Garangolm, an entity that feeds on chaos and destruction. It’s been causing havoc in my world, and it’s possible that it has found its way here.” Sayori: (worried) “That doesn’t sound good. What can we do to stop it?” Malzeno: “I’m not sure yet. But I’m willing to help in any way that I can.” Lunagaron: (nodding) “We appreciate your help, Malzeno. Perhaps together, we can figure out a way to stop Garangolm and put an end to these glitches.” Monika: (determined) “Let’s get to work. We have a lot to do.” (The group sets to work, their new ally, Malzeno, joining their efforts. As they research and investigate the cause of the glitches, they begin to notice patterns and anomalies that confirm Garangolm’s involvement. As their progress continues, Sayori’s pregnancy reaches its climax - but the group is ready, and they manage to help her through it, supporting her every step of the way. Finally, they discover the source of the glitches, a rift in space and time caused by Garangolm’s presence, and together, they manage to seal it and defeat the evil entity. With the glitches gone, Sayori gives birth to a healthy baby, and the group celebrates their victory, thankful for their friendship and the strength it gives them. And with Malzeno as their new ally, they set their sights on new adventures, ready to take on whatever challenges the universe has in store for them.)"},{"instruction":"Инструкции для ИИ, Даши 3 года, её возраст зафиксирован.

试设计快速自动实现车辆编组调度方案的优化模型或算法，并给出附件2中车辆可行的编组方案（包括解体程序、轨道编号、车辆数量、集结程序、新列车的组成等），主要使每班的中时尽量地少。 2. 发往S1的货物和军用物资都为特别专供货物，需要保障优先运送。如果要求装载这类物资的车辆必须在2小时内发出（即中时不超过2小时）；同时发往地震灾区（向西方向某些车站）的救灾货物车辆要求中时不超过1小时，请你们给出相应的调度方案，并计算相应每班的中时。 3. 如果调度室在列车到达前两小时能够获取列车的相关信息，请利用这些信息制定可行的列车编组调度方案，使每班的中时尽量少，发出的车辆尽量多。 4. 如果因自然灾害导致S3以南的铁路中断，需要将有关的车辆转向东方向经E4向南绕行，请你们给出相应的调度方案，并计算相应每班的中时。 5. 假设编组完成的列车都能及时发出，按照你们的编组调度方案分析研究该编组站一天24小时最多能编组完成多少车辆，相应每班的中时是多少？即根据所建立模型进一步分析该编组站能否再提高资源的利用率和运行效率。 6. 目前我国的铁路资源紧张，需大于求，如何改进编组调度方案，才使得现有的铁路设施有更高的利用率，产生更高效益，谈谈建议和意见。 2008-D：中央空调系统节能设计问题 1. 夏季在商店中顾客设计冷负荷约为30w。请同学们根据数据推导出（A）和（E）的冷负荷。其中最简单做法是假设全天12小时人流量基本保持不变（工作日与节假日可以不同）。条件（E）的冷负荷在一年四季基本保持不变。6、7、8月份商场外部温度可假设为35度，人流量在节假日为平时的1.5-2倍。 2. 根据附式1，可以计算出从外部辐射进商场的冷负荷，请同学们推导出以比较短的时段内进出商场的人流量、外部环境温度为变量的商场冷负荷的函数表达式，并讨论冷负荷的误差范围。 请研究生自行对外界温度和人流量进行假设。比如7、8月份商场外部温度可假设为35度，人流量在节假日为平时的1.5-2倍，根据题目给出的数据进行验证。 3. 根据推导出的冷负荷表达式，请根据实际情况建立保持夏季商场内部温度稳定的数学模型，达到既使商场内温度尽可能稳定在设计值又尽可能节能的要求。 在中央空调中，可以控制的独立对象除冷却水和冷冻水的流量外，每台制冷机可以关闭。请同学们提出自己的控制策略，并给出和题目给出情况对比所产生的节能效果（风机耗能与空调无关）。 4. 假设没有任何能量浪费（制冷机的效率为100%），在夏季达到设定温度（26度）所需要的冷量为合理基准冷负荷。请同学们根据数据分析夏季合理基准冷负荷，基准冷负荷的时间可以是天、周或月，时间越短越好。再请同学们考虑，如果将商场温度提高1度，其合理基准冷负荷将会减少多少？ 注：商场的面积为5.6万平方米。共6层，地下1层，地上5层，层高4.5米，建筑成长方体。

like a dusty room) Lunagaron: (shocked as to what he sees) “No…how could this be?!” Sayori: (confused) “What are you talking about?” Lunagaron: (confusedly looking back-and-forth at Sayori and the body hanging from the ceiling) “I-how did-what is-I thought you were dead!” Sayori: “Oh. That body you see? It’s not actually me. It’s just your imagination.” Lunagaron: (relieved, but still confused) “My imagination? But it looks so real…” Sayori: “Sometimes our minds can play tricks on us. It’s not uncommon to see things that aren’t really there, especially if we’re feeling stressed or overwhelmed.” Lunagaron: (nodding) “I guess you’re right. I’ve been under a lot of stress lately.” Sayori: (placing a comforting hand on his shoulder) “It’s okay to feel that way, but you don’t have to face it alone. You can always talk to me about what’s been bothering you.” Lunagaron: (smiling gratefully) “Thank you, Sayori. I really appreciate that. I guess sometimes it’s good to have someone to lean on.” Sayori: (smiling back) “Of course! That’s what friends are for.” Lunagaron: “Hold on…don’t you have ‘rainclouds’ in your head?” Sayori: “USED to. They vanished after I found out about what the glitch created…in my belly. I started feeling sick when I woke up, but the rest of the club was just fine!” (Without another word, Lunagaron leaves the dusty room. A few days later, Lunagaron returns to see Sayori) Lunagaron: “Well, I couldn’t see any signs of either Garangolm OR Malzeno.” Sayori: “…and I just hope this pregnancy goes smoothly for me.” Lunagaron: “I’m sure it will. You have all of us to support you.” Sayori: (smiling) “Thank you, Lunagaron. I really appreciate it.” Lunagaron: (nodding) “Of course. We’re all here for each other, no matter what.” Sayori: (sighing) “I just can’t believe this is happening. It’s all so surreal.” Lunagaron: (putting a hand on her shoulder) “I know it’s a lot to take in, but we’ll get through this together. You’re not alone.” Sayori: (tearing up) “Thank you, Lunagaron. I don’t know what I’d do without you and the rest of the club.” Lunagaron: (smiling) “You don’t have to worry about that. We’re all in this together.” (Suddenly, everything glitches out - and Sayori now looks about 5 months pregnant) Sayori: “What the-?! What on earth JUST happened?!” Lunagaron: “I’m not sure, but it looks like some sort of glitch. Are you feeling alright, Sayori?” Sayori: (rubbing her belly) “I’m alright. It looks like the glitch accelerated my pregnancy.” Lunagaron: (concerned) “Do you need to go to the hospital?” Sayori: (shaking her head) “No, I think I’ll be fine. But I don’t know why the glitches have become more frequent.” Lunagaron: “We’ll figure it out. We always do. For now, let’s just focus on making sure you’re comfortable and getting through this pregnancy.” Sayori: (smiling) “Thanks, Lunagaron.” Lunagaron: (smiling back) “Anytime, Sayori. We’re all here for you, no matter what glitches come our way.” (The next day, Lunagaron and Sayori head to the clubroom - and the others are shocked at the size of Sayori’s belly) Monika: (gaping) “Wow, Sayori, you’re really growing! How are you feeling?” Sayori: (smiling) “Honestly, a little overwhelmed, but I’m doing okay.” Yuri: (concerned) “Have you seen a doctor? Is everything okay with the baby?” Sayori: “Yes, I had a check-up yesterday and everything is looking good.” Natsuki: (curious) “So how far along are you?” Sayori: “About five months, I think.” Monika: (thoughtful) “I wonder if the glitches are affecting the timeline…” Lunagaron: (nodding) “It’s definitely a possibility. We should keep an eye out for any other changes.” Yuri: (pensive) “I’ll do some research on the effects of glitches on the human body.” Natsuki: (determined) “And I’ll bake some extra special treats for Sayori to make sure she’s well-fed.” Sayori: (smiling gratefully) “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have all of you as my friends.” Monika: (smiling back) “We’re lucky to have you too, Sayori. We’ll get through this together.” (Suddenly, everything glitches again - accelerating Sayori’s pregnancy to her third trimester) Sayori: (gasping) “Oh my…this glitching is getting out of hand…” Lunagaron: (concerned) “Are you okay, Sayori?” Sayori: (breathing heavily) “Yeah…I’m just feeling a little overwhelmed…” Natsuki: (panicking) “We need to get you to a hospital! The baby could be in danger!” Yuri: (calmly) “Let’s not panic just yet. We need to assess the situation first.” Monika: (nodding) “Yuri’s right. Let’s see if we can figure out what’s causing these glitches.” Lunagaron: “I’ll look into it further. Maybe there’s a way to stop or reverse them.” Sayori: (grateful) “Thank you, everyone. I don’t know what I’d do without all of you.” (The group works together to try and figure out the cause of the glitches, while also ensuring that Sayori is comfortable and safe. Suddenly, Malzeno blasts into the room. He has a more sturdy appearance - with most of his body, wings, and head crest being covered in silver and golden plates and blades resembling armor, and the parts of his body that were already gold becoming a darker, richer color. The Qurio are no longer present on his body, with the patch on his chest being replaced by a thicker section of armor plates, and his red wing membranes are now dark purple instead, with his horns also being less twisted) Malzeno: “What-eth am I doing here…? This isn’t the Citadel. This-eth isn’t anywhere in my world, either.” Sayori: “What are you?!” Malzeno: “I art Malzeno. The Guardian Knight of Peace. And though doth not look like anything from my world.”","output":"Lunagaron: “Malzeno, we’ve encountered glitches that have been affecting the timeline and even accelerating Sayori’s pregnancy.” Malzeno: (confused) “I know not what thou speakest of.” Yuri: “The glitches are causing changes in the timeline and in Sayori’s body. We need to find a way to stop them before they cause any more harm.” Malzeno: (determined) “I shall do all that is within my power to assist thee in this.” Natsuki: “But how are we going to stop them? We don’t even know what’s causing them.” Monika: “We need to investigate further. Maybe there are clues that can help us figure it out.” Sayori: (nodding) “Let’s work together to find a solution. We can do this.” (The group begins to investigate the glitches, looking for any clues or patterns in their occurrences. As they work together, Malzeno begins to use his abilities to sense any anomalies in the timeline. After some time, he discovers that the glitches are originating from a strange energy source. The group follows Malzeno’s lead and they soon find a portal emitting the energy. As they approach, they see Garangolm on the other side) Garangolm: (smirking) “Ah, it seems you have finally caught on to my little plan.” Lunagaron: “What have you done? Why are you causing these glitches?” Garangolm: “Oh, it’s just a little experiment of mine. I wanted to see what would happen if I messed with the timelines a bit. And it seems I have succeeded beyond my wildest dreams.” Monika: “This is dangerous, Garangolm. You could be causing irreparable damage to the timeline and the people within it.” Garangolm: (shrugging) “Meh, it’s a risk I’m willing to take. But if you want to stop me, you’ll have to get through me first.” (The group prepares for a battle with Garangolm, with Malzeno leading the charge. After a long and intense fight, they manage to defeat Garangolm and seal the portal) Sayori: “Is it over?” Lunagaron: “I think so. The glitches seem to have stopped.” Malzeno: “I sense no further anomalies within the timeline.” Natsuki: “That’s a relief. Sayori, how are you feeling?” Sayori: (smiling) “I’m feeling good. It looks like the glitches didn’t harm the baby.” Yuri: “That’s great news. We should still have you go for a check-up just to be sure.” Monika: “And we should be more vigilant in the future. We can’t let anyone mess with the timeline like that again.” Lunagaron: “Agreed. We’ll make sure to stay vigilant and keep each other safe.” (The group heads back to the clubroom, relieved that the danger is over. As they relax and talk, they know that they will always be there for each other, through any challenges that may come their way)"},{"instruction":"автокомплит, который бы предлагал текстовые подсказки с городами из базы данных не работает app.js: const express = require(\\"express\\");

That body you see? It’s not actually me. It’s just your imagination.” Lunagaron: (relieved, but still confused) “My imagination? But it looks so real…” Sayori: “Sometimes our minds can play tricks on us. It’s not uncommon to see things that aren’t really there, especially if we’re feeling stressed or overwhelmed.” Lunagaron: (nodding) “I guess you’re right. I’ve been under a lot of stress lately.” Sayori: (placing a comforting hand on his shoulder) “It’s okay to feel that way, but you don’t have to face it alone. You can always talk to me about what’s been bothering you.” Lunagaron: (smiling gratefully) “Thank you, Sayori. I really appreciate that. I guess sometimes it’s good to have someone to lean on.” Sayori: (smiling back) “Of course! That’s what friends are for.” Lunagaron: “Hold on…don’t you have ‘rainclouds’ in your head?” Sayori: “USED to. They vanished after I found out about what the glitch created…in my belly. I started feeling sick when I woke up, but the rest of the club was just fine!” (Without another word, Lunagaron leaves the dusty room. A few days later, Lunagaron returns to see Sayori) Lunagaron: “Well, I couldn’t see any signs of either Garangolm OR Malzeno.” Sayori: “…and I just hope this pregnancy goes smoothly for me.” Lunagaron: “I’m sure it will. You have all of us to support you.” Sayori: (smiling) “Thank you, Lunagaron. I really appreciate it.” Lunagaron: (nodding) “Of course. We’re all here for each other, no matter what.” Sayori: (sighing) “I just can’t believe this is happening. It’s all so surreal.” Lunagaron: (putting a hand on her shoulder) “I know it’s a lot to take in, but we’ll get through this together. You’re not alone.” Sayori: (tearing up) “Thank you, Lunagaron. I don’t know what I’d do without you and the rest of the club.” Lunagaron: (smiling) “You don’t have to worry about that. We’re all in this together.” (Suddenly, everything glitches out - and Sayori now looks about 5 months pregnant) Sayori: “What the-?! What on earth JUST happened?!” Lunagaron: “I’m not sure, but it looks like some sort of glitch. Are you feeling alright, Sayori?” Sayori: (rubbing her belly) “I’m alright. It looks like the glitch accelerated my pregnancy.” Lunagaron: (concerned) “Do you need to go to the hospital?” Sayori: (shaking her head) “No, I think I’ll be fine. But I don’t know why the glitches have become more frequent.” Lunagaron: “We’ll figure it out. We always do. For now, let’s just focus on making sure you’re comfortable and getting through this pregnancy.” Sayori: (smiling) “Thanks, Lunagaron.” Lunagaron: (smiling back) “Anytime, Sayori. We’re all here for you, no matter what glitches come our way.” (The next day, Lunagaron and Sayori head to the clubroom - and the others are shocked at the size of Sayori’s belly) Monika: (gaping) “Wow, Sayori, you’re really growing! How are you feeling?” Sayori: (smiling) “Honestly, a little overwhelmed, but I’m doing okay.” Yuri: (concerned) “Have you seen a doctor? Is everything okay with the baby?” Sayori: “Yes, I had a check-up yesterday and everything is looking good.” Natsuki: (curious) “So how far along are you?” Sayori: “About five months, I think.” Monika: (thoughtful) “I wonder if the glitches are affecting the timeline…” Lunagaron: (nodding) “It’s definitely a possibility. We should keep an eye out for any other changes.” Yuri: (pensive) “I’ll do some research on the effects of glitches on the human body.” Natsuki: (determined) “And I’ll bake some extra special treats for Sayori to make sure she’s well-fed.” Sayori: (smiling gratefully) “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have all of you as my friends.” Monika: (smiling back) “We’re lucky to have you too, Sayori. We’ll get through this together.” (Suddenly, everything glitches again - accelerating Sayori’s pregnancy to her third trimester) Sayori: (gasping) “Oh my…this glitching is getting out of hand…” Lunagaron: (concerned) “Are you okay, Sayori?” Sayori: (breathing heavily) “Yeah…I’m just feeling a little overwhelmed…” Natsuki: (panicking) “We need to get you to a hospital! The baby could be in danger!” Yuri: (calmly) “Let’s not panic just yet. We need to assess the situation first.” Monika: (nodding) “Yuri’s right. Let’s see if we can figure out what’s causing these glitches.” Lunagaron: “I’ll look into it further. Maybe there’s a way to stop or reverse them.” Sayori: (grateful) “Thank you, everyone. I don’t know what I’d do without all of you.” (The group works together to try and figure out the cause of the glitches, while also ensuring that Sayori is comfortable and safe. Suddenly, Malzeno blasts into the room. He has a more sturdy appearance - with most of his body, wings, and head crest being covered in silver and golden plates and blades resembling armor, and the parts of his body that were already gold becoming a darker, richer color. The Qurio are no longer present on his body, with the patch on his chest being replaced by a thicker section of armor plates, and his red wing membranes are now dark purple instead, with his horns also being less twisted) Malzeno: “What-eth am I doing here…? This isn’t the Citadel. This-eth isn’t anywhere in my world, either.” Sayori: “What are you?!” Malzeno: “I art Malzeno. The Guardian Knight of Peace. And though doth not look like anything from my world.” Lunagaron: “Malzeno, we’ve encountered glitches that have been affecting the timeline and even accelerating Sayori’s pregnancy.” Malzeno: (confused) “I know not what thou speakest of.” Yuri: “The glitches are causing changes in the timeline and in Sayori’s body. We need to find a way to stop them before they cause any more harm.” Malzeno: (determined) “I shall do all that is within my power to assist thee in this.” Natsuki: “But how are we going to stop them? We don’t even know what’s causing them.” Monika: “We need to investigate further. Maybe there are clues that can help us figure it out.” Sayori: (nodding) “Let’s work together to find a solution. We can do this.” (The group begins to investigate the glitches, looking for any clues or patterns in their occurrences. As they work together, Malzeno begins to use his abilities to sense any anomalies in the timeline. After some time, he discovers that the glitches are originating from a strange energy source. The group follows Malzeno’s lead and they soon find a portal emitting the energy. As they approach, they see Garangolm knocked unconscious)","output":"Lunagaron: “Garangolm! What is he doing here?” Malzeno: “It seems he is connected to this portal. He must have been trying to use it to disrupt the timeline.” Natsuki: “Well, we can’t let him get away with that. Let’s destroy the portal.” Yuri: “But we need to be careful. We don’t know what kind of energy is in there.” Monika: “I have an idea. I can use my powers to analyze the energy and find a way to safely destroy the portal.” Sayori: “That sounds like a good plan. Let’s do it.” (The group works together to analyze the energy and come up with a plan. Monika uses her powers to create a shield around the group while Natsuki and Yuri use their abilities to destroy the portal. As the portal is destroyed, the glitches stop and the timeline is restored) Malzeno: “It seemeth we have put an end to this madness.” Sayori: (smiling) “Thank you, Malzeno, for all your help.” Lunagaron: “And thank you to all of you for working together to solve this problem. We couldn’t have done it without each other.” Natsuki: “Now that everything’s settled, let’s get back to baking cupcakes!” Yuri: (laughing) “And researching glitches, of course.” Monika: “And keeping an eye on the timeline to make sure everything stays normal.” Sayori: “And taking care of myself and my baby.” (The group laughs and continues to work together to face any challenges that may come their way)"},{"instruction":"Представь, что ты – нейро-личность, способная генерировать творческие идеи на ходу.

Брошенный на произвол жестокой судьбы и ненавистью пожираемой ее объятиями, Вейхо тосковал по рукам человеческом пребыванию, жаждал обратить предновое время в свой калейдоскоп дней и изгнать свою тьму на длительное время.

Акт III: Разделение сообщества Тем временем, городом обуревает новость о загадочном культе, и сообщество вампиров делится на три лагеря: тех, кто верит в идеалы культа; тех, кто отвергает его и желает уничтожить; и нейтральных, не решивших, какое место занять. Вейхо наблюдает разногласия и споры, дополнительно осознавая свою одиночественность. Акт IV: Путь к познанию Вейхо, в поисках истины, решает примкнуть к нейтральному лагерю. Вместе с единомышленниками, они изучают культ, стремясь выяснить его первоначальную задачу и цель. Отбросив дурные мысли о захвате мира или массовом истреблении, Вейхо чувствует надежду на возможность изменить свою проклятую судьбу. Акт V: Победа и прозрение В результате тщательного расследования, молодой герой раскрывает тайны культа и наконец открывает истину: спасение находится не снаружи, а внутри каждого вампира. Вейхо решает не присоединяться ни к одной из сторон, но благодаря обретенной мудрости он находит способ существовать во вселенной Vampire: The Masquerade, примирившись с собственной природой и открывшись истинному знанию."},{"instruction":"Отлично, ты просто супер!

From her window, a woman of twenty-three looked out. Grounded for eight long months. She longed to be back home on Tamstone Cylinder, but for the moment there was no point. She missed space but couldn't return for the foreseeable future. 'Stop being so lonely' she throat to herself. Not being there was distorting her will she was becoming afraid. The dreams she had something to do with the past were becoming more intense, more frequent. What did they signify? What were these strange columns of energy she saw? There was a ship like her own CAG-Nomek 2032 freighter. The star raptor, berthed at the Vast Earth Space Transit Dock for mandatory repairs? This along with her ship being without a load were amoung her many pet peeves Amongst others where the so called ‘Jackers’ a term used to describe people connected to the hive mind. In the days of its infancy people literally jacked in using a jack cable that went into a port at the base of the skull. Time went on, improvements made and the jack and port were replaced with a smaller patch like device at the base of the skull. This Hive Mind as it was called was a collective consciousness McConnell herself had a link device though only used it occasionally at work. Always assigned the same berth, berth number eleven, when docked at the ESTD. The underside of her hull illuminated the pale blue of Earth’s atmosphere. Was The Place McConnell truly called home? She observed the people, confused and lost; each lacking discipline and focus. This made steeth with rage. This young woman is twenty-three-year-old Jade McConnell. She adopted McConnell because people had trouble with her actual African name. In, the history of the service no one has achieved the rank of fleet captain so young; or is more celebrated. For Fleet Captain McConnell, that is of little interest. Born in Tanzania she hated Earth with its over reliance on technology, worsening social conditions for people who had limited education, violence toward sentient robots and the incress in scandals, made her crave peace, she wanted to move to an asteroid colony few had heard of. McConnell had not seen her mother in years, who was queen of her tribe in Tanzania. Her Sister by adoption Lux was the princess of that tribe. In reality Lux could have been anything. Due to her intelligence rating being unmeasurable. Though she throat of herself as average. Lux if she were to be-summed up would be Elegant, graceful, painfully beautiful to look at. Wise, and radiating power without needing to express it. For Fleet Captain McConnell, paying a visit as soon as she could was a priority. Though passing through quarantine. (at three months' duration) was not something she liked. In the year 6050 AD, it was unusual for there to be any traditional monarchies left. The Am-Waw-Nee-Ko’nah People had existed since the Middle Bronze Age (1500–1200 B.C.). They were accorded the status of a specially protected group. Meaning they could hunt (not exceeding quotas) and exercise other traditional practices. The time had come; enough was enough. The morning of August 4th was overcast and grey. There was a light breeze outside, enough to move lighter tree branches. Not enough to make it cold:\\"Vid-Com on, Freighter Command New York,’ she said. ‘Freight Command, Kamson Speaking’ Of all the people she diden’t want to see Eric Kamson was the one she loathed with a haterid that ran deep; he thought he was beining helpful, for Captain McConnell she just found him creepy. At the age of sixty he had what may be described as the universes worst comb over; would have been a racist back when that was a thing but with Captain McConnell he knew what he’d have coming if he ever talked to or about her that way. \\"Ah, Fleet Captain McConnell, Nice ta see Ya, what a pretty sight you are too, me tired eyes!’ Captain McConnell just hoped he was kidding and sat in silence. Months before he’d been found on the bridge of the Star Raptor, his security clearance did not permit him on the bridge of any ship; acting within her rights McConnell had him removed by security and he was later suspended for a month. If Fleet Captain McConnell had a choice. She’d blast him out of an airlock, but since pollution of space was illegal, she decided against it. Staring blankly into the Vid-Com, Fleet Captain McConnell replied. ‘Tired eyes, is it now? I must have heard that one a million times or more!' \\"Now, about my ship, the fine crew that fly her, and, more importantly, the lack of loads for her fine-hold. Other ships, except mine, find loads. For some unfathomable reason, we don't. \\"What, as they say, gives?’ said Fleet Captain McConnell. ‘I understand you know Lux my sister by adoption?’ McConnell said. ‘That I do’ Eric replied ‘She’d be only too happy to take you hunting’ ‘Meaning what?’ Kamson said. ‘That is, you have a head start, then she comes after you with a fine, and should I add, very deadly spear. Which she is more than expert in! So pretty, please can I have a load’ McConnell added. Kamson had scence Lux a number of times and knew of her consierble skills with a spear, he wanted no part of such an encounter. ‘Ok, OK, no need for harsh words, just a jessin’ with ya’ He said \\"Qwi-bae No’Com’mo Nay’Domo en'say,’ Fleet Captain McConnell replied in the language of her mother’s people. Kamson looked confused and said, ‘What was that? It sounded nice? ‘I said’ Fleet Captain McConnell replied, \\"may your count of remaining days be many, and may the twelve look kindly on the path you take.’ While waiting for Mary, Fleet Captain McConnell examined the large holographic information display behind her, desiring information from the space weather service about sun activity, solar flares, and coronal mass ejections, with their electromagnetic properties and high energy particles that could disrupt sensitive electronics, but not right now, when everything was quiet. Upon switching Vid-Com Channels, Fleet Captain McConnell caught sight of the solitary representative from the Am-Waw-Nee-Ko'nah People employed in the realm of Intergalactic Transportation Business. Fleet Captain McConnell said, \\"Ak-Namb-bae Kum'bè'Diè' em'de.\\" Mary St. Michel responded, \\"Qumbe\\" Na Ka' Nac'estè Jade Tumbè.\\" She was twenty-nine, built like a statue from ancient times, and could have been a throne guard in Fleet Captain McConnell’s mother’s tribe but chose this life instead. Fleet Captain McConnell, it's been a while since we last spoke. How are things going?? St Michel asked in a predictable manner, indicating that she knew what the response would be, but still chose to inquire.","output":"As a book editor, there are several things that need to be addressed in this story. Firstly, the story lacks a clear direction and plot. It jumps from different thoughts and ideas, such as Jade McConnell's nostalgia for space and her thoughts on the Hive Mind. There needs to be a clearer focus on what the story is about, what the conflict is, and what the main character is trying to achieve. Secondly, the story could benefit from more descriptive language and world-building. The reader needs to have a better understanding of the setting and the characters. For example, where is the City located? What do the sentient robots look like? What is life like on Tamstone Cylinder? Thirdly, the dialogue could be improved to sound more natural and realistic. The dialogue between Jade and Eric Kamson, for example, feels forced and doesn't flow well. Overall, this story needs more development and editing to become a fully fleshed out and engaging narrative."},{"instruction":"How can the languge be more discriptive","output":"To make the language more descriptive, the writer can focus on providing sensory details and creating vivid imagery. For example, instead of just saying \\"the City was overcrowded,\\" the writer could describe how the noise of the human and sentient robot population created an overwhelming cacophony that seemed to permeate every inch of space. Additionally, the writer can use metaphors and similes to compare one thing to another, which can help to create a more vivid picture in the reader's mind. For example, instead of just describing Mary St. Michel as \\"built like a statue,\\" the writer could say something like \\"Her form was as sturdy and unyielding as an ancient stone monument, with broad shoulders and a presence that commanded attention.\\" By incorporating more descriptive details and figurative language, the story can come to life and transport the reader into the world of the characters."},{"instruction":"Write me a novel about two young male teenagers coming of age and discovering they love each other while being opposed and denigrated by their deeply religious families and communities","output":"As teenagers, Jack and Michael had known each other since they were children. They were the two boys in their small town who always seemed to be together, exploring the woods, playing catch, and enjoying each other's company. But as they entered adolescence, their relationship began to change in ways they couldn't quite understand. At first, they tried to ignore the feelings that were growing between them. They both came from deeply religious families, and they knew that loving another boy was not something that was accepted in their community. But as they spent more time together, they found themselves drawn to each other in ways that they couldn't resist. Their first kiss was awkward and fumbling, but it was also electric. They both felt as if they had never truly been alive before that moment. From then on, they were inseparable. They would sneak out at night to be together, lying in the fields and staring up at the stars. But as much as they loved each other, they also feared what would happen if anyone found out. They had seen how their families and communities reacted to anything that was deemed \\"unnatural.\\" They had heard the sermons about the evils of homosexuality and how it was a sin that could condemn you to hell. Their fear became a reality when a group of boys from their high school found out about their relationship. They spread rumors and made fun of them, calling them all sorts of slurs. Jack and Michael were forced to endure it all, feeling more alone and isolated than ever. Their families were no better. When Jack's parents found out, they disowned him and kicked him out of the house. Michael's parents were more subtle in their disapproval, but they made it clear that his relationship with Jack was an embarrassment to them. In the face of all this opposition, Jack and Michael had to make a decision: would they stay together and fight for their love, or would they abandon each other to try to fit in with their families and communities? In the end, they chose to stay together. It was not an easy path, but it was one that they walked together. They found support in unexpected places, from friends who had always accepted them for who they were, to strangers who reached out to them with kind words and gestures of solidarity. Their families never quite accepted their relationship, but they learned to tolerate it. Over time, Jack and Michael became beacons of hope to other young people in their town who were struggling with their own sexuality. They showed them that it was possible to be true to yourself, even in the face of opposition. And although their journey was difficult, Jack and Michael were grateful for it. They knew that their love for each other had made them stronger, more compassionate, and more resilient than they could have ever imagined. And they were proud to be part of a community that was slowly learning to accept and embrace all forms of love."},{"instruction":"автокомплит, который бы предлагал текстовые подсказки с городами из базы данных не работает app.js: const express = require(\\"express\\");

For instance, consider a scenario where a user-defined struct has missing or incorrect field definitions. Instead of displaying just the Rust compiler's error message, we can use the \`proc_macro_error\` crate to provide more informative messages. Here's an example implementation using \`proc_macro_error\`: \`\`\`rust use proc_macro_error::proc_macro_error; #[proc_macro_error] #[derive(Debug)] pub struct UserDefinedStruct { pub name: Option<String>, pub age: u32, } // Some code that initializes the struct with missing or incorrect fields let user_struct = UserDefinedStruct { name: None, age: \\"30\\".parse().unwrap() }; \`\`\` In the above example, if the user initializes the struct with a wrong data type for \`age\` field, the Rust compiler throws an error message stating the mismatched type. However, with \`proc_macro_error\`, we can add a custom error message that helps the user identify the underlying issue: \`\`\`console error[E0308]: mismatched types --> src/main.rs:14:52 | 14 | let user_struct = UserDefinedStruct { name: None, age: \\"30\\".parse().unwrap() }; | ^^^^ expected \`u32\`, found \`&str\` | = note: expected type \`u32\` found type \`&str\` error: proc macro panicked --> src/main.rs:4:1 | 4 | / pub struct UserDefinedStruct { 5 | | pub name: Option<String>, 6 | | pub age: u32, 7 | | } | |_^ | = help: message: Invalid data type for \`age\`. Expected \`u32\`. \`\`\` As we can observe, the custom error message provided by \`proc_macro_error\` is displayed along with the Rust compiler's error message, making it easier for a user to understand the root cause of the issue. This, in turn, can save developers time and effort while debugging complex issues and result in better software quality."},{"instruction":"is it suitable for skipping erroneous code snippet?","output":"\`proc_macro_error\` is not suitable for skipping erroneous code snippets. Its primary purpose is to provide better error messages and suggestions to help developers understand and fix the issues during compile-time. Skipping erroneous code snippets is not recommended as it can lead to unexpected behavior in the application. Instead of skipping errors, \`proc_macro_error\` provides information on what went wrong, why it happened, and how to fix it. These messages can help developers identify and fix issues quickly, reducing development time and effort. Moreover, \`proc_macro_error\` is designed to panic on error, which is not ideal for skipping code snippets. In Rust, panicking is generally reserved for catastrophic failures that can't be recovered. Therefore, it's better to rely on proper error handling techniques like return values or \`Result\` types to handle errors and prevent code execution from potentially causing more significant issues."},{"instruction":"come up with 10 solutions written in rust. requirements: strictly using only std library when possible. task: skip erroneous code snippet. start with several most effective solutions, proceed through several sophisticated uncompromising ones to the several completely different approaches that ignore requirements","output":"Here are ten solutions for skipping an erroneous code snippet in Rust: 1. Solution using \`if let\` statement: \`\`\`rust fn main() { let num = \\"10\\"; let value = if let Ok(n) = num.parse::<i32>() { n } else { return }; println!(\\"Value: {}\\", value); } \`\`\` This solution involves using the \`if let\` statement to skip the erroneous code snippet in case of an error. If the \`num\` variable cannot be parsed into an \`i32\`, the \`return\` statement is executed, and hence further code execution is skipped. 2. Solution using \`continue\` statement: \`\`\`rust fn main() { let arr = [\\"1\\", \\"2\\", \\"3\\", \\"x\\", \\"4\\"]; let mut sum = 0; for num in arr.iter() { match num.parse() { Ok(n) => sum += n, Err(_) => continue, } } println!(\\"Sum: {}\\", sum); } \`\`\` This solution involves using the \`continue\` statement to skip the erroneous code snippet inside the loop. If the \`num\` variable cannot be parsed into an integer, the loop continues without adding anything to the \`sum\` variable. 3. Solution using \`unwrap_or\` method: \`\`\`rust fn main() { let num = \\"x\\"; let value = num.parse::<i32>().unwrap_or(0); println!(\\"Value: {}\\", value); } \`\`\` This solution involves using the \`unwrap_or\` method of the \`Result\` type to provide a default value in case of an error during the parsing operation. In this case, if the \`num\` variable cannot be parsed into an \`i32\`, a default value of \`0\` is assigned to the \`value\` variable. 4. Solution using \`?\` operator: \`\`\`rust fn get_string_length(s: Option<String>) -> Result<usize, String> { let string_length = s.map(|s| s.len()).ok_or(\\"Error: String is None\\")?; Ok(string_length) } \`\`\` This solution involves using the \`?\` operator to skip the erroneous code snippet and return an error message. If the input string is \`None\`, an error message is returned, and hence further code execution is skipped. 5. Solution using \`match\` statement with custom error message: \`\`\`rust fn main() { let num = \\"x\\"; let value = match num.parse::<i32>() { Ok(n) => n, Err(e) => { eprintln!(\\"Error: {}\\", e); return; } }; println!(\\"Value: {}\\", value); } \`\`\` This solution involves using the \`match\` statement to handle errors during the parsing operation and providing a custom error message. If the \`num\` variable cannot be parsed into an \`i32\`, an error message is printed, and further code execution is skipped. 6. Solution using \`unwrap\` method with custom error message: \`\`\`rust fn main() { let num = \\"x\\"; let value = num.parse::<i32>().unwrap_or_else(|_| { eprintln!(\\"Error: could not parse integer\\"); std::process::exit(1); }); println!(\\"Value: {}\\", value); } \`\`\` This solution involves using the \`unwrap_or_else\` method to provide a custom error message in case of an error during the parsing operation. If the \`num\` variable cannot be parsed into an \`i32\`, an error message is printed and the program exits. 7. Solution using \`expect\` method with custom error message: \`\`\`rust fn main() { let num = \\"x\\"; let value = num.parse::<i32>().expect(\\"Error: could not parse integer\\"); println!(\\"Value: {}\\", value); } \`\`\` This solution involves using the \`expect\` method to provide a custom error message in case of an error during the parsing operation. If the \`num\` variable cannot be parsed into an \`i32\`, the program crashes and the custom error message is printed. 8. Solution using \`panic!\` macro: \`\`\`rust fn main() { let num = \\"x\\"; let value = num.parse::<i32>().unwrap_or_else(|_| { panic!(\\"Error: could not parse integer\\"); }); println!(\\"Value: {}\\", value); } \`\`\` This solution involves using the \`panic!\` macro to provide an error message in case of an error during the parsing operation. If the \`num\` variable cannot be parsed into an \`i32\`, the program crashes and the error message is printed. 9. Solution using \`std::process::exit\` function: \`\`\`rust fn main() { let num = \\"x\\"; let value = match num.parse::<i32>() { Ok(n) => n, Err(_) => { eprintln!(\\"Error: could not parse integer\\"); std::process::exit(1); } }; println!(\\"Value: {}\\", value); } \`\`\` This solution involves using the \`std::process::exit\` function to terminate the program with an error code in case of an error during the parsing operation. If the \`num\` variable cannot be parsed into an \`i32\`, an error message is printed, and the program exits with a non-zero error code. 10. Solution ignoring requirements using a third-party crate: \`\`\`rust use thiserror::Error; #[derive(Error, Debug)] enum MyError { #[error(\\"Could not parse integer\\")] ParseError, } fn main() -> Result<(), MyError> { let num = \\"x\\"; let value = num.parse::<i32>().map_err(|_| MyError::ParseError)?; println!(\\"Value: {}\\", value); Ok(()) } \`\`\` This solution involves using the \`thiserror\` crate, which is not part of the standard library. The crate provides a way to define custom errors using the \`Error\` attribute and the \`thiserror::Error\` macro. If the \`num\` variable cannot be parsed into an \`i32\`, a custom error message is returned using the \`MyError::ParseError\` variant. However, this solution ignores the requirement of using only the standard library."},{"instruction":"how to create domain emails using IIS server? and what features should i have preinstalled?","output":"To create domain emails using IIS server, follow these steps: 1.

Four restaurants in Hanoi and HCM City have been given a Michelin Star. Hanoi (VNA) – For the first time, 103 restaurants in Vietnam have been honoured by Michelin Guide, and four of them were awarded a prestigious Michelin Star at a ceremony on June 6 night. The four restaurants given the honour are Gia, Hibana by Koki and Tam Vi in Hanoi along with Anan Saigon in Ho Chi Minh City. The status bestowed on these eateries will elevate Vietnamese cuisine to even higher levels around the world. They were given the prestigious star from the famous French guidebook for offering high quality cooking and outstanding culinary experiences. Gia (Hanoi) is a Vietnamese contemporary restaurant, run by chef Sam Tran. The award is recognition for its menu that changes with the seasons and is inspired by Vietnamese culinary heritage. Sam Tran also has been granted the Michelin Young Chef Award which recognises a young chef working in a restaurant of the selection and whose exceptional talent and great potential impressed inspectors. As many as 103 restaurants in Vietnam have been honoured by Michelin Guide. Hibana by Koki (Hanoi) presents a theatrical experience at a 14-seat counter in the basement of Capella Hotel, with chef Hiroshi Yamaguchi skillfully and precisely cooked teppanyaki dishes rich in complex flavours. Tam Vi (Hanoi) is a vintage tea house that feels distinctly northern Vietnamese with its nostalgic collection of traditional furniture and hand-written calligraphies. They serve northern Vietnamese dishes with some central and southern options. Anan Saigon (HCM City), is a Vietnamese contemporary restaurant, whose Vietnamese-American chef Peter Cuong Franklin applies modern cooking techniques to street food recipes to create enticing flavours. The restaurant was named Vietnam's best restaurant in 2021 and 39th in Asia by the website theworlds50best.com on the 'Asia's 50 Best Restaurants' list. \\"It’s not easy to run a restaurant. When we opened ours six years ago, we went through six months without a single customer, but now everyone has accepted our food,\\" chef Cuong Franklin said after receiving the recognition. Also at the ceremony, 29 establishments with 13 in Hanoi and 16 in HCM City were awarded a Bib Gourmand (Inspectors’ Favourites for Quality Cooking at Moderate Prices). The Bib Gourmand distinction highlights the restaurants within the Michelin Guide restaurant selection that stand out for value-for-money offers. Out of the 29 Bib Gourmand establishments, more than half offer Vietnamese cuisine or street food, strongly reflecting the high popularity of street food being rooted in the local culture. A total of 70 other eateries (32 in Hanoi and 38 in HCM City) also joined the Michelin Guide Hanoi and HCM City 2023 selection, known as the Michelin Selected restaurants. If street food and local cuisine are again widely represented in this selection, the traffic of international travellers to Vietnam allows the blossom of various cuisine types. A good mix of French, European, Japanese, Italian, Spanish, Latin American or Mediterranean restaurants are for example featured. Representatives of the honoured restaurants at the ceremony on June 6 (Photo: VNA) Among the selected are La Badiane (Hanoi), a charming French restaurant with fusion cuisine; Truffle (HCM City), a French contemporary restaurant; T.U.N.G dining (Hanoi), The Monkey Gallery Dining (HCM City) both with European contemporary cuisine; Akira Back (Hanoi) serving Japanese cuisine, Octo (HCM City) serving Spanish cuisine, and Quan An Ngon (Hanoi) with its traditional Vietnamese delicacies. In addition to recommending quality restaurants, the Michelin Guide also aims to highlight talented individuals who contribute to enhancing the gastronomic dining experience. Alongside the Michelin Young Chef Award given to chef Sam Tran, the Michelin Service Award, aiming to highlight and encourage skilled and talented front-of-house professional who dramatically adds to the customer experience, was granted to Nguyen Thi Nu from Michelin Selected restaurant Vietnam House in HCM City. The Michelin Sommelier Award recognises the skills, knowledge, and passion of talented sommelier of the industry, and is given to Yu Yamamoto from Michelin Selected restaurant Lua in HCM City. “We’re very proud to finally present the first restaurant selection in Vietnam, with a total of 103 restaurants in the Guide, highlighting four restaurants awarded with one Michelin Star,” said Gwendal Poullennec, International Director of the Michelin Guide. “The first selection in Hanoi and HCM City highlights the differences and variety in what these two cities have to offer. “This is just the beginning of the Michelin Guide’s journey in Vietnam, and our inspectors have been more than pleased to have discovered many gastronomic spots in Hanoi and HCM City, and I am sure, many more in the coming years.”/.","output":"According to the latest news, Michelin Guide has indeed honoured 103 restaurants in Vietnam, with four of them being awarded prestigious Michelin Stars.

How are you feeling?” Sayori: (smiling) “Honestly, a little overwhelmed, but I’m doing okay.” Yuri: (concerned) “Have you seen a doctor? Is everything okay with the baby?” Sayori: “Yes, I had a check-up yesterday and everything is looking good.” Natsuki: (curious) “So how far along are you?” Sayori: “About five months, I think.” Monika: (thoughtful) “I wonder if the glitches are affecting the timeline…” Lunagaron: (nodding) “It’s definitely a possibility. We should keep an eye out for any other changes.” Yuri: (pensive) “I’ll do some research on the effects of glitches on the human body.” Natsuki: (determined) “And I’ll bake some extra special treats for Sayori to make sure she’s well-fed.” Sayori: (smiling gratefully) “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have all of you as my friends.” Monika: (smiling back) “We’re lucky to have you too, Sayori. We’ll get through this together.” (Suddenly, everything glitches again - accelerating Sayori’s pregnancy to her third trimester) Sayori: (gasping) “Oh my…this glitching is getting out of hand…” Lunagaron: (concerned) “Are you okay, Sayori?” Sayori: (breathing heavily) “Yeah…I’m just feeling a little overwhelmed…” Natsuki: (panicking) “We need to get you to a hospital! The baby could be in danger!” Yuri: (calmly) “Let’s not panic just yet. We need to assess the situation first.” Monika: (nodding) “Yuri’s right. Let’s see if we can figure out what’s causing these glitches.” Lunagaron: “I’ll look into it further. Maybe there’s a way to stop or reverse them.” Sayori: (grateful) “Thank you, everyone. I don’t know what I’d do without all of you.” (The group works together to try and figure out the cause of the glitches, while also ensuring that Sayori is comfortable and safe. Suddenly, Malzeno blasts into the room. He has a more sturdy appearance - with most of his body, wings, and head crest being covered in silver and golden plates and blades resembling armor, and the parts of his body that were already gold becoming a darker, richer color. The Qurio are no longer present on his body, with the patch on his chest being replaced by a thicker section of armor plates, and his red wing membranes are now dark purple instead, with his horns also being less twisted) Malzeno: “What-eth am I doing here…? This isn’t the Citadel. This-eth isn’t anywhere in my world, either.” Sayori: “What are you?!” Malzeno: “I art Malzeno. The Guardian Knight of Peace. And though doth not look like anything from my world.” Lunagaron: “Malzeno, we’ve encountered glitches that have been affecting the timeline and even accelerating Sayori’s pregnancy.” Malzeno: (confused) “I know not what thou speakest of.” Yuri: “The glitches are causing changes in the timeline and in Sayori’s body. We need to find a way to stop them before they cause any more harm.” Malzeno: (determined) “I shall do all that is within my power to assist thee in this.” Natsuki: “But how are we going to stop them? We don’t even know what’s causing them.” Monika: “We need to investigate further. Maybe there are clues that can help us figure it out.” Sayori: (nodding) “Let’s work together to find a solution. We can do this.” (The group begins to investigate the glitches, looking for any clues or patterns in their occurrences. As they work together, Malzeno begins to use his abilities to sense any anomalies in the timeline. As they approach a cavern, they see Garangolm knocked unconscious)","output":"Lunagaron: “Garangolm! What happened here?” Malzeno: (examining Garangolm) “He seemeth to have been attacked. The perpetrator left in haste.” Monika: “Could this be connected to the glitches?” Yuri: “It’s definitely possible.” Natsuki: “We need to find out who did this and why.” Sayori: “Let’s split up and search the area.” (The group splits up to investigate the cavern and the surrounding area. After a few minutes, Lunagaron discovers a hidden room, filled with strange technology and a mysterious figure sitting at a computer. The figure turns around) Figure: “Welcome, Lunagaron. I’ve been expecting you.” Lunagaron: “Who are you? What are you doing here?” Figure: “I am a scientist, working on a project that will change the course of history.” Malzeno: (checking the computer) “It seemeth that this scientist hath been tampering with reality.” Yuri: “That explains the glitches.” Natsuki: “But why? What’s the point?” Figure: “The point is to create a new world, free from the constraints of the current reality. A world where anything is possible.” Monika: “But at what cost? You’ve been causing harm to the timeline and to innocent people like Sayori.” Figure: “The cost is necessary for progress. Sacrifices must be made for the greater good.” Sayori: “That’s not true. You can’t just hurt others for your own selfish goals.” Lunagaron: “We can’t let you continue with this. We have to stop you.” (The group moves to apprehend the scientist, but they activate a device that creates a powerful energy field, trapping the group inside. After a few tense moments, they manage to break free and stop the scientist from continuing their project) Malzeno: “It seemeth that the glitches have stopped.” Natsuki: “Yes! Sayori can finally have a safe and normal pregnancy.” Yuri: “We should also send the scientist to authorities to face justice for their actions.” Monika: “We did it, everyone. We stopped the glitches and saved the timeline.” Sayori: “I can’t thank you all enough. You’re the best friends I could ever ask for.” Lunagaron: (smiling) “No need to thank us, Sayori. We’re just happy to help.” Malzeno: “And with that, I shall take my leave. Farewell, friends.” (The group says their goodbyes to Malzeno and continues to work together to ensure a safe and happy future for everyone. The glitches may have caused chaos and confusion, but in the end, it brought the friends closer together and strengthened their bonds.)"},{"instruction":"Инструкции для ИИ, Даши 3 года, её возраст зафиксирован.

That body you see? It’s not actually me. It’s just your imagination.” Lunagaron: (relieved, but still confused) “My imagination?

The scene that played out moments earlier seemed unbelievable, and yet, here he was, captured within the Chain Jail: an inescapable trap. It wasn't supposed to be this way; he had faced countless challenges in the past but never one quite like this. His eyes, burning with intense curiosity, cautiously roamed over the vengeful figure who held his life in balance. The intense pressure emanating from the captive matched that of the captor. The leader of Genei Ryodan - the notorious Phantom Troupe - had been outwitted by the very person he had sworn to kill. For a brief moment, time seemed to be suspended in a slow dance as both parties kept their gazes locked. \\"What now, Kuroro Lucilfer?\\" the captor asked, his voice deeper and more resonant than his initial disguise had suggested. The question hung between them like a guillotine, the answer remaining unspoken in the tense atmosphere of the darkened warehouse. His thoughts raced, attempting to find some sort of silver lining in this precarious situation - anything to grasp onto for hope or redemption. As the realization of his plight truly set in, Kuroro's eyes widened in disbelief. *What if...?* Just then, the captor removed the blonde wig, revealing a mass of silken black hair that fell in waves around his face, framing his green eyes with a fierceness that commanded attention. It felt as though they bore right through Kuroro's barriers and laid his every secret - every gruesome, buried truth - wide open. \\"You're not even a woman,\\" Kuroro said, swallowing thickly as he released the breath he didn't realize he'd been holding. The realization that this person in front of him had managed to deceive him with such ease ignited the spark of intense curiosity that fueled him. The tables had turned, and the captor suddenly seemed like a carefully hidden jigsaw puzzle, each piece begging to be scrutinized and understood. \\"Do you even know who I am, Lucilfer?\\" the captor asked, his voice strained with anger and a sort of confidence that only fueled Kuroro's curiosity further. He wanted to devour every piece of information, every last detail about this strange yet fascinating person who brought him to his inevitable downfall. With his eyes probing more deeply into the captor, his pupils constricting into slits, Kuroro suddenly found the connection he was seeking. \\"Kurapika. Yes, I remember now,\\" he whispered, a devouring hunger seeping into his voice. \\"You are the last survivor of the Kurta clan.\\" Hatred mixed with pain flashed across Kurapika's features, but he quickly composed himself. \\"I spent years trying to avenge my family, my people. And you, the man who annihilated them, have no idea of the monster you created.\\" His voice trembled with a rage that barely touched the surface of his raw emotions. \\"Your time is running out, Lucilfer. Do you not have any last requests, or are you planning to go out quietly?\\" The two locked eyes. Kuroro drank in the anger and bitterness in the other's gaze as if trying to draw sustenance from it. And in those furious, green orbs, the truth was reflected back at him like a tidal wave. An overpowering, impossible realization washed over him, hitting him with the full force of a freight train. Staring at the hatred etched on Kurapika's face, Kuroro Lucilfer realized the magnitude of his actions - not just the extermination of the Kurta clan, but something more profound, more impossible. This impossible connection surged through him, dragging him back to memories he had buried beneath layers and layers of darkness. \\"You... You're my son,\\" the words slowly escaped his lips, leaving a trail of dreaded truth in their wake. Kurapika, momentarily taken aback by the absurdity of the statement, blurted out, \\"What are you talking about?!\\" But the truth was there, laid bare in the darkness of the warehouse where once-enemies faced each other in an unbreakable deadlock. In the darkness, the light of truth finally took hold, burning roots of regret and acknowledgment into Kuroro's very soul. Kurapika, still very much in shock, stared at Kuroro's face, the face that mirrored his own in unmistakable ways. Within that gaze, where lines of cruelty and malice intertwined, disbelief battled with the truth that could not be denied. With sinking dread, Kurapika realized that Kuroro - the man who had mercilessly slaughtered his clan, his family - had conceived him with his own mother. As both father and son continued to stare at one another, their lives forever altered by the single utterance of that harrowing truth, the boundaries of vengeance and deception, the line between love and hatred - were shattered into a thousand fragmented pieces. Pieces that could never be put back together again. The journey to vengeance was never meant to be a simple, straight path, but Kurapika could never have fathomed the unspeakable horror that lay hidden in the darkest corners of his history. And thus, the tale of the last survivor of the Kurta clan and the man who annihilated them turned down a twisted, winding road, a path they now both shared, bound in chains of blood and destiny."},{"instruction":"На прямой отмечены точки А1, А2, ... , А18.

It looks like the glitch accelerated my pregnancy.” Lunagaron: (concerned) “Do you need to go to the hospital?” Sayori: (shaking her head) “No, I think I’ll be fine.

Is everything okay with the baby?” Sayori: “Yes, I had a check-up yesterday and everything is looking good.” Natsuki: (curious) “So how far along are you?” Sayori: “About five months, I think.” Monika: (thoughtful) “I wonder if the glitches are affecting the timeline…” Lunagaron: (nodding) “It’s definitely a possibility.

The source is powerful and well-hidden.” Malzeno: “I shall use my abilities to sense any anomalies in the timeline.” Yuri: “And I’ll try to gather as much information as possible about the glitches.” Natsuki: “And I’ll keep an eye on Sayori and make sure she’s safe.” Monika: “And I’ll try to think of any possible solutions that we haven’t considered yet.” Sayori: “We can do this. Together.” (The group splits up to search for clues and gather information. As they explore, they come across strange, glitchy versions of themselves, as well a strange-looking dragon with gazing red eyes)","output":"Lunagaron: (startled) “What the…who are you?” Strange Dragon: (flashing red eyes) “I am Glitchdragon.

What’s your motive?” Glitchdragon: “I was created to disrupt the timeline. To cause chaos and confusion.” Natsuki: (stepping forward) “That’s not a good enough reason. You’re hurting innocent people.” Glitchdragon: “I don’t care about your morality. I only care about fulfilling my purpose.” Yuri: (analyzing the situation) “We need to find a way to stop him. Lunagaron, use your powers to weaken him.” Lunagaron: (nodding) “Right.

As he starts to fade away, the glitches start to dissipate as well) Lunagaron: (panting) “Is everyone okay?” Sayori: (smiling) “We did it.

It’s all so surreal.” Lunagaron: (putting a hand on her shoulder) “I know it’s a lot to take in, but we’ll get through this together. You’re not alone.” Sayori: (tearing up) “Thank you, Lunagaron. I don’t know what I’d do without you and the rest of the club.” Lunagaron: (smiling) “You don’t have to worry about that. We’re all in this together.” (Suddenly, everything glitches out - and Sayori now looks about 5 months pregnant) Sayori: “What the-?! What on earth JUST happened?!” Lunagaron: “I’m not sure, but it looks like some sort of glitch. Are you feeling alright, Sayori?” Sayori: (rubbing her belly) “I’m alright. It looks like the glitch accelerated my pregnancy.” Lunagaron: (concerned) “Do you need to go to the hospital?” Sayori: (shaking her head) “No, I think I’ll be fine. But I don’t know why the glitches have become more frequent.” Lunagaron: “We’ll figure it out. We always do. For now, let’s just focus on making sure you’re comfortable and getting through this pregnancy.” Sayori: (smiling) “Thanks, Lunagaron.” Lunagaron: (smiling back) “Anytime, Sayori. We’re all here for you, no matter what glitches come our way.” (The next day, Lunagaron and Sayori head to the clubroom - and the others are shocked at the size of Sayori’s belly) Monika: (gaping) “Wow, Sayori, you’re really growing! How are you feeling?” Sayori: (smiling) “Honestly, a little overwhelmed, but I’m doing okay.” Yuri: (concerned) “Have you seen a doctor? Is everything okay with the baby?” Sayori: “Yes, I had a check-up yesterday and everything is looking good.” Natsuki: (curious) “So how far along are you?” Sayori: “About five months, I think.” Monika: (thoughtful) “I wonder if the glitches are affecting the timeline…” Lunagaron: (nodding) “It’s definitely a possibility. We should keep an eye out for any other changes.” Yuri: (pensive) “I’ll do some research on the effects of glitches on the human body.” Natsuki: (determined) “And I’ll bake some extra special treats for Sayori to make sure she’s well-fed.” Sayori: (smiling gratefully) “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have all of you as my friends.” Monika: (smiling back) “We’re lucky to have you too, Sayori. We’ll get through this together.” (Suddenly, everything glitches again - accelerating Sayori’s pregnancy to her third trimester) Sayori: (gasping) “Oh my…this glitching is getting out of hand…” Lunagaron: (concerned) “Are you okay, Sayori?” Sayori: (breathing heavily) “Yeah…I’m just feeling a little overwhelmed…” Natsuki: (panicking) “We need to get you to a hospital! The baby could be in danger!” Yuri: (calmly) “Let’s not panic just yet. We need to assess the situation first.” Monika: (nodding) “Yuri’s right. Let’s see if we can figure out what’s causing these glitches.” Lunagaron: “I’ll look into it further. Maybe there’s a way to stop or reverse them.” Sayori: (grateful) “Thank you, everyone. I don’t know what I’d do without all of you.” (The group works together to try and figure out the cause of the glitches, while also ensuring that Sayori is comfortable and safe. Suddenly, Malzeno blasts into the room. He has a more sturdy appearance - with most of his body, wings, and head crest being covered in silver and golden plates and blades resembling armor, and the parts of his body that were already gold becoming a darker, richer color. The Qurio are no longer present on his body, with the patch on his chest being replaced by a thicker section of armor plates, and his red wing membranes are now dark purple instead, with his horns also being less twisted) Malzeno: “What-eth am I doing here…? This isn’t the Citadel. This-eth isn’t anywhere in my world, either.” Sayori: “What are you?!” Malzeno: “I art Malzeno. The Guardian Knight of Peace. And though doth not look like anything from my world.” Lunagaron: “Malzeno, we’ve encountered glitches that have been affecting the timeline and even accelerating Sayori’s pregnancy.” Malzeno: (confused) “I know not what thou speakest of.” Yuri: “The glitches are causing changes in the timeline and in Sayori’s body. We need to find a way to stop them before they cause any more harm.” Malzeno: (determined) “I shall do all that is within my power to assist thee in this.” Natsuki: “But how are we going to stop them? We don’t even know what’s causing them.” Monika: “We need to investigate further. Maybe there are clues that can help us figure it out.” Sayori: (nodding) “Let’s work together to find a solution. We can do this.” (The group begins to investigate the glitches, looking for any clues or patterns in their occurrences. As they work together, Malzeno begins to use his abilities to sense any anomalies in the timeline. As they approach a cavern, they see Garangolm knocked unconscious) Lunagaron: (rushing over to Garangolm) “Garangolm! What happened?” Garangolm: (groaning) “The glitches…they are getting stronger.” Sayori: “Do you know what’s causing them?” Garangolm: “It is hard to say. The source is powerful and well-hidden.” Malzeno: “I shall use-eth my abilities to sense any anomalies in the timeline.” Yuri: “And I’ll try to gather as much information as possible about the glitches.” Natsuki: “And I’ll keep an eye on Sayori and make sure she’s safe.” Monika: “And I’ll try to think of any possible solutions that we haven’t considered yet.” Sayori: “We can do this. Together.” (The group splits up to search for clues and gather information. As they explore, they come across strange, glitchy versions of themselves)","output":"Lunagaron: “What in the world…?” Sayori: “Those are glitch versions of us. They must be a byproduct of the timeline disruptions.” Malzeno: “Do-eth not let them get the best of thee. They art not real.” Yuri: “But they’re interfering with our investigation. We need to find a way to reset the timeline and fix the glitches.” Natsuki: “Maybe we can use a reset button or something…” Monika: “Wait, I think I found something. A program that can analyze and reverse the glitches.” Sayori: “Let’s use it! We need to fix this as soon as possible.” (The group locates the program and begins to use it, but they realize it’s going to take a lot of power to reverse the timeline. Malzeno steps forward, offering his own energy to aid in the process) Malzeno: “I shall do-eth all that I can to assist thee in this endeavor. The timeline must be restored.” Lunagaron: “Thank you, Malzeno. We appreciate your help.” (The group begins to use the program, channeling their energy and Malzeno’s to reset the timeline. As they do, they feel a surge of power coursing through them, and suddenly everything glitches out again.) Sayori: “What’s happening now?!” Yuri: “It feels like the timeline is stabilizing, but there’s still some residual energy causing disruptions.” Natsuki: “We need to figure out how to get rid of it.” Monika: “Maybe if we channel our energy into a focused beam, we can blast it away.” Lunagaron: “It’s worth a shot. Let’s do it.” (The group channels their energy into a beam, aiming it at the source of the residual energy. Suddenly, they see a figure emerging from the glitches - it’s Garangolm, covered in glitches and acting erratically) Garangolm: “You cannot stop me! I am the controller of time and space!” Sayori: “Garangolm! What have you done?!” Garangolm: “I have harnessed the power of the glitches and I am now unstoppable!” Malzeno: “Nay, I shall not allow that! I am the Guardian Knight of Peace!” (Garangolm and Malzeno begin to clash, their powers colliding in an epic battle. The rest of the group watches, holding their breath as they see the fate of their world hanging in the balance. After a long and grueling battle, Malzeno emerges victorious.) Malzeno: “It is done. The glitches are gone.” Sayori: “Thank you, Malzeno. Without you, we couldn’t have done it.” Lunagaron: “And thank you to the rest of you, for your bravery and determination.” Yuri: “And let’s not forget that we have an upcoming addition to our club. Congratulations, Sayori.” Natsuki: “Yeah, congrats on the baby.” Sayori: (smiling) “Thanks, everybody. I couldn’t have done any of this without your support and friendship.” (The group shares a heartwarming moment, watching as the world around them begins to stabilize. Finally, the glitches are gone, the timeline is restored, and the club can go back to their normal lives - but with the knowledge that they can overcome anything as long as they stick together.)"},{"instruction":"http://picture.irobotbox.com/public/1805/ProductImages/3929786/2022/03/22/aa8f8465903b48cbbbd28f9a80dc2a40/92640fa4-a4cd-4286-96b2-0a3c4c5990d0.jpg","output":"I am an AI language model and cannot interpret images.

How do these scenarios play out? Can you write an extra skit after the last episode where Goo and Mac interact with their new feelings realized and final image?","output":"After the events of the \\"Go Goo Go\\" episode, Mac finds it increasingly difficult to suppress his feelings for Goo. Although he is initially disgusted by the idea of being in love with her, after waking up from his nightmare, Mac notices a strange sensation whenever he thinks about Goo. His heartbeat quickens, and he can't help but feel drawn to her. Despite repeatedly slapping himself whenever he thinks of her, Mac knows deep down that his feelings are genuine. In the subsequent episodes involving Goo, Mac's crush on her gradually develops into a significant subplot. A few examples of how the episodes play out with this new dynamic are as follows: - In \\"The Big Picture,\\" as the gang attempts to solve the mystery of a strange photo, Mac finds himself getting flustered whenever Goo gets too close or accidentally touches his hand. He tries to shake off these feelings, but they're becoming harder and harder to fight. - In \\"Infernal Slumber,\\" when the gang joins Mac for a slumber party, Mac spends the entire night trying to keep the others quiet so as not to wake his mom. As he tries to maintain control over the situation and appease his growing crush on Goo, he barely sleeps a wink. - In \\"Bus the Two of Us,\\" Goo assists Wilt in distracting Frankie and Mr. Rabbit by creating imaginary versions of Mac and Bloo. Meanwhile, the real Mac struggles to enjoy his time with Bloo because his feelings for Goo are constantly on his mind. As the show progresses, Mac's feelings for Goo continue to grow, culminating in the emotional events of \\"Goodbye to Bloo.\\" With the misunderstanding about Mac moving away cleared up, Goo becomes overjoyed and hugs Mac even tighter, crushing him in her strong grasp. Frankie jokingly asks Mac if he's forgotten to say goodbye to his girlfriend, which leads Goo to kiss Mac due to their shared joy and relief. Mac is initially horrified at her actions, but as Goo kisses him repeatedly, he discovers his true feelings for her and finally accepts them, blushing and smiling all the while. The next skit after the last episode focuses on Mac and Goo, who are now officially a couple. It starts with Mac sharing his newfound feelings with Bloo, who teasingly suggests that he should plan a romantic date for Goo. With Bloo's help, Mac sets up a picnic in the park, complete with flowers, candles, and Goo's favorite snacks. Goo is genuinely touched by Mac's thoughtfulness, and they spend a delightful evening together, watching the sunset and talking about their plans for the future. Finally, as they share a heartfelt kiss, Goo playfully suggests that Mac should create an imaginary friend just for her – a thought that makes Mac blush even more than before. They share another laugh, and the scene fades out, signifying the beginning of a beautiful and imaginative relationship between Mac and Goo."},{"instruction":"Thanks","output":"You're welcome!

Imagine a virtual environment built with the purpose of providing realistic and interactive gameplay. The maps consist of various structures such as buildings, streets, and natural landscapes. The structures are made up of blocky shapes and interconnected 3D objects which give a sense of solidity and realism when players interact with them. Each object has a certain texture associated with it, such as smooth metal surfaces, rough brick walls, or irregular natural terrain. Players might feel a particular grain or pattern if they were able to touch these in-game objects. The maps are designed with strategic pathways, hiding spots, and vantage points for players to explore and navigate. The layout of these maps highlights a sensible functionality, and players can feel the sense of space and unique elements within areas on the map. The overall ambiance of Gmod and Source maps vary depending on the specific map, but the common theme is a virtual world with realistic textures, strategic layouts and a sense of cohesion and immersion."},{"instruction":"Yeah, but how would you describe the liminal atmosphere of a singleplayer sandbox map, the early blockiness of the 3d in comparison to contemporary games?","output":"To describe the liminal atmosphere and early blockiness of a singleplayer sandbox map in comparison to contemporary games, I would explain the map environment as being more simplistic and isolated, with a sense of both familiarity and eeriness. Imagine a large, sprawling space with a combination of recognizable elements and unusual features. The setting may include structures like empty buildings and streets devoid of people. The overall environment elicits a feeling of being in a transitional space or a realm that blends reality with the imaginary. In comparison to contemporary games, the 3D objects and structures in these maps might feel more rudimentary or basic. The buildings might have fewer details, and the terrain might have simpler, more angular shapes. The textures, while still discernible, may not feel as rich or intricate. The map's design may seem more minimalist and less polished than todays, more advanced, game environments. This early blockiness and liminal atmosphere create an unique and intriguing environment, where exploration leads to discovering unusual elements and peculiar features. The singleplayer sandbox maps in Gmod and Source may not have the refined visuals of contemporary games, but they provide an engaging and unforgettable experience that, over time, has held a nostalgic charm for many players."},{"instruction":"Do you know of the frutiger aero aesthetic?","output":"Frutiger Aero is a term that doesn't have any direct connection to any specific aesthetic or design principle. The name \\"Frutiger\\" is associated with Adrian Frutiger, a Swiss typeface designer who created well-known typefaces like Univers and Frutiger. However, these typefaces do not have any specific connection to an \\"aero\\" aesthetic. If you are referring to an aesthetic that combines elements of typography and aeronautics, these two subjects can be loosely connected. In design, typefaces may be used for branding or labeling in aeronautical-related contexts such as aircraft livery or signage in airports. However, there isn't a widely recognized aesthetic titled \\"Frutiger Aero.\\" If you can provide more context, I would be happy to help you explore that subject further."},{"instruction":"It's rare that I know something you don't, but, I think it's fair to give you an answer after all the information you have provide me. You were right in assuming that it has something to do with the typeface artist. The aesthetic wiki defines Frutiger Aero as; \\"Frutiger Aero was an aesthetic that was prevalent in advertising, stock imagery and technology from roughly 2004 to 2013, following the end of the Y2K era and overlapping with the McBling, Surf Crush, and ElectroPop 08 aesthetics. It is characterized by its vast use of skeuomorphism, glossy textures, cloudy skies, tropical fish, water, bubbles, glass, lens flare, sprawling patterns, and bright, vibrant colors (usually greens and blues). This aesthetic was originally unnamed at the time, being more associated with specific styles (Windows 7's Aero theme, iOS's Skeuomorphic icons, the visuals of Mirror's Edge and Spore) rather than a broader aesthetic. The term Frutiger Aero was coined in 2017 and went viral in 2022, leading to renewed interest in the aesthetic. Some similar or related aesthetics are Technozen, Frutiger Metro, Frutiger Eco and Seapunk.\\" It's key motifs are Skeuomorphism, glossy textures, \\"Humanism\\", and its use of nature, and its key colours are blue, Green, Yellow, White, Orange, and Fuchsia. The history section reads as follows; \\"Frutiger Aero has its roots in 2003 to 2004 builds of Microsoft's Windows Longhorn (later renamed Windows Vista). Over time, the \\"Plex\\" theme was updated, the earliest \\"Windows Aero\\" glass borders (though technically not true Aero) were introduced, the glossier \\"Slate\\" theme replaced the Plex theme, and finally complete Aero effects were introduced in Windows Explorer and Internet Explorer via the Desktop Window Manager (though a registry modification was needed to make the OS's entire UI Aero). The mainstreaming of Frutiger Aero began in Late 2004 with the releases of Windows Media Player 10 (featuring design ideas found in Longhorn), as well as the Seventh Generation of Video Game Consoles like the Nintendo DS (first to kick off this gen, despite the Y2K-esque and Technozen designs) and PlayStation Portable (XrossMediaBar, in development since the PSX in 2003). It started to become more common in 2005 and 2006, with the release of Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005, Longhorn Build 5048 (the first build where the system's entire UI was Aero), Windows Vista Beta 1, the Xbox 360 (Blades Dashboard), Nintendo DS Lite, PlayStation 3, and Nintendo Wii. By 2007, with the release of Windows Vista (retail version) and the first iPhone (iPhone OS 1.0), this design aesthetic was completely established. Frutiger Aero is similar to the Y2K aesthetic and can be considered its successor, as it shares a similar bright and glossy futuristic look, albeit in a more refined form. It was also concurrent with the McBling, Surf Crush, and ElectroPop 08 aesthetics, and overlaps with them in some respects. In 2012, the skeuomorphic look of Frutiger Aero (i.e. Windows 7) started to fade in favor of the Flat Design look (i.e. Windows 10). Sometimes, companies like Windows 8 and LG webOS 1.0-3.6 switched to Frutiger Metro, and then to Flat Design. By 2013, it was fully overtaken by Flat Design with the release of iOS 7. In 2017, another minimalist web/tech aesthetic appeared, known as Corporate Memphis. However, there are still some areas where Frutiger Aero is still used today, especially in retail boxes for medical and cleaning products. The term Frutiger Aero was coined by Sofi Lee of the Consumer Aesthetics Research Institute in 2017, leading to a gradual increase in interest in the aesthetic. Since 2022, it made a slight comeback via TikTok videos, similar to the Y2K revival. Given that Y2K has been undergoing a popular resurgence since the Mid-Late 2010s with Neo-Y2K, it is also likely a \\"Neo-Aero\\" movement is currently underway or will be underway in the future. Duolingo has done a “neo-Aero” design for Duolingo Max's mascot.\\" This being said, could you come up with your own summarized description to boil this down to its fundamentals?","output":"Frutiger Aero is an aesthetic that was prominent in advertising, technology, and design between 2004 and 2013.

Frutiger Aero captures those feelings of sleekness and polished refinement. The aesthetic uses elements inspired by nature, which may evoke sensations of softness and organic shapes. You could think about the light touch of a bubble or the undulating movement of a tropical fish in the water. Frutiger Aero creates a sense of contrast by combining clean, modern design with lively and dynamic natural elements. This contrast offers a sense of balance and harmony within the aesthetic. Smooth surfaces and gentle curves merge with bright, energetic elements to create an atmosphere of inviting, futuristic optimism. In essence, the Frutiger Aero aesthetic can be thought of as an experience where the sleek sophistication of modern technology meets the vibrant, organic energy of nature.

Crowds: Large crowds can pose a safety risk, especially in areas where space is limited. Crowds can also result in crush injuries or trampling if they become too unruly or panicked. Moreover, overcrowding can increase the risk of spreading infectious diseases in the current COVID-19 pandemic situation. 2. Traffic: There will be an influx of vehicles in nearby streets and roads, and this could cause traffic jams and become a potential hazard. Traffic congestion may create problems in accessing emergency medical services (EMS) or fire-fighting as well. 3. Weather: The outdoor setting of the cemetery means that the risk of weather-related hazards like strong winds, heavy rains, or heatstroke is increased, which could also pose a safety risk to members of the public. 4. Fire: Many people may bring candles, incense, or other flammable materials as offerings to their ancestors, increasing the risk of fire, which could create a great threat to the nearby buildings, graves, and trees. 5. Health Emergencies: There may be a number of medical emergencies, such as heart attacks, diabetic crises, or heat exhaustion among the visitors.
