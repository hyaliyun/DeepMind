Esto significa que a temperatura ambiente, el líquido tiende a evaporarse con relativa facilidad. La razón principal de la evaporación del combustible en los Zippo y otros encendedores de mecha es el diseño de su sistema de almacenamiento de combustible. El combustible se almacena en una mecha rodeada de un relleno de algodón (o un material similar) dentro del cuerpo del encendedor. Este diseño permite que el combustible se evapore lentamente y se mezcle con el oxígeno, lo que facilita la ignición cuando se acciona la piedra del encendedor para generar chispa. Sin embargo, esto también hace que el combustible se evapore constantemente, incluso cuando el encendedor no se está usando. La tasa de evaporación dependerá de varios factores, como la temperatura ambiental, el nivel de relleno del combustible y la frecuencia de uso. Los encendedores Zippo no son completamente herméticos, lo que es necesario para permitir la ignición, pero esto también significa que hay una constante pérdida de combustible debido a la evaporación. A pesar de esta característica, los Zippo son muy valorados por su fiabilidad, durabilidad y la capacidad de recargarlos fácilmente, lo que compensa la necesidad de rellenar el combustible con mayor frecuencia en comparación con otros tipos de encendedores."},{"instruction":"hay alguna manera de evitar esto?","output":"Para reducir la evaporación del combustible en los encendedores Zippo, puedes seguir estas sugerencias, aunque es importante señalar que debido al diseño inherente de los Zippo, no es posible evitar completamente la evaporación del combustible: 1. **Mantén tu Zippo lleno pero no en exceso:** Un relleno adecuado asegura que haya suficiente combustible para el uso, pero no tanto como para que aumente la tasa de evaporación debido al exceso de líquido. 2. **Usa el inserto interior:** Algunos modelos de Zippo vienen con un inserto interior de plástico que ayuda a reducir la velocidad de evaporación del combustible. Si tu Zippo no vino con uno, considera buscar en línea para ver si puedes encontrar un inserto compatible. 3. **Guarda tu Zippo en un lugar fresco y seco:** Las altas temperaturas pueden aumentar la tasa de evaporación. Evitar la exposición directa al sol y no dejarlo en lugares donde la temperatura puede elevarse, como el interior de un coche en un día soleado, puede ayudar. 4. **Utiliza una bolsa hermética:** Cuando no estés usando tu Zippo, considera guardarlo en una pequeña bolsa hermética de plástico. Esto puede ayudar a reducir la tasa de evaporación al minimizar la cantidad de aire (y por lo tanto, oxígeno) que está en contacto con el combustible. 5. **Mejora la hermeticidad:** Aunque los Zippo no están diseñados para ser completamente herméticos, algunos usuarios han experimentado con añadir juntas tóricas o selladores alrededor del lugar donde la tapa y el cuerpo del encendedor se encuentran para mejorar la hermeticidad y reducir la evaporación. Sin embargo, esto debe hacerse con cuidado para no alterar el funcionamiento normal del encendedor. 6. **Revisa y reemplaza la mecha y la piedra regularmente:** Una mecha desgastada o una piedra que no produce una chispa eficiente pueden hacer que utilices el encendedor más veces para conseguir una llama, lo que indirectamente aumenta la tasa de evaporación al tener que abrir y cerrar el encendedor más frecuentemente. Asegurarte de que estos componentes estén en buen estado puede ayudar a mantener tu Zippo funcionando eficientemente. Ten en cuenta que, aunque estas sugerencias pueden ayudar a reducir la evaporación del combustible, es una característica inherente de los encendedores Zippo debido a su diseño abierto. La evaporación del combustible es simplemente parte de la experiencia de usar un Zippo."},{"instruction":"图像平滑度如何计算","output":"图像的平滑度可以使用各种方法来计算，其中最常用的方法之一是通过计算图像的梯度。图像的梯度可以用于衡量图像中像素值的变化程度，而图像的平滑度可以通过梯度的大小来表示。 一种常用的方法是使用Sobel算子来计算图像的梯度，然后计算梯度的幅度作为图像的平滑度的度量。另一种方法是计算图像的拉普拉斯算子，然后计算其绝对值作为图像的平滑度的度量。 除此之外，还可以使用其他一些方法来计算图像的平滑度，比如计算图像的灰度梯度、计算图像的高斯滤波等。这些方法都可以用来衡量图像的平滑度，具体选择哪种方法取决于具体的应用场景和需求。"},{"instruction":"假设我有一个图模型，一个中心顶点和上下左右四个领域顶点，四条边权重分别为0.3，0.3，0.3，0.1，我该通过什么样的算法将0.1权重的这条边识别出来并分割掉，如果我想运用图割算法应该怎么设计","output":"要将权重为0.1的这条边识别出来并分割掉，可以考虑使用最小生成树算法，如Prim算法或Kruskal算法。这两种算法可以帮助您找到一棵覆盖所有顶点且权重之和最小的树。通过在计算最小生成树时，可以将权重为0.1的这条边排除在外，使得最终生成的树不包含这条边。 若想运用图割算法进行分割，则可按以下步骤设计： 1. 首先构建图模型，将顶点作为节点，将原图中的边以对应的权重添加到图中。 2. 根据这个图模型进行分割，可以选择使用最大流最小割算法或者基于图割的分割算法，如图割定理和最小割定理。这些算法可以在图中找到一条切割线，使得两个部分的权重之和最小。 3. 在运行图割算法时，可以指定某些边为必须切割的边，例如将权重为0.1的那条边标记为必须切割的边，从而确保这条边会被切割掉。 通过以上步骤，您可以利用图割算法对图模型进行分割，并同时识别并分割掉权重为0.1的那条边。这样就能达到您的需求。"},{"instruction":"不全是这个意思比如，权重为0.3，0.3，0.3，0.7我想把0.7选出来，选出来的是最偏离其他权重的值而非最大或者最小","output":"如果您想从权重为0.3，0.3，0.3，0.7的四条边中选出最偏离其他权重的值，而不是最大或最小的值，可以考虑使用离群值检测的方法。 一种常用的离群值检测算法是孤立森林（Isolation Forest）算法。孤立森林是一种基于树的离群值检测算法，它利用树的分裂过程来检测离群值。在您的情况下，您可以使用孤立森林算法来识别权重为0.7的边，因为这条边与其他边的权重明显偏离，可以被判定为离群值。 另一种方法是使用聚类算法，如K均值聚类（K-means clustering）或DBSCAN聚类算法，将权重作为特征进行聚类，然后根据聚类结果找出与其他权重偏离最大的值，即为您要找的值。 通过上述方法，您可以找到与其他权重偏离最大的值，从而实现识别出权重为0.7的这条边。您可以根据具体情况选择合适的算法进行实现。"},{"instruction":"一组数中一个元素与数据中心的偏离程度如何计算","output":"一个元素与数据中心的偏离程度可以通过计算该元素与数据中心的距离来表示。常见的方法有欧氏距离、曼哈顿距离和切比雪夫距离等。 欧氏距离是最常见的距离度量方法，可以通过以下公式计算： [ text{欧氏距离} = sqrt{(x_1 - c)^2 + (x_2 - c)^2 + ldots + (x_n - c)^2} ] 其中，(x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n) 是数据中心的各个维度的坐标，(c) 是数据中心的坐标。 曼哈顿距离是另一种常见的距离度量方法，可以通过以下公式计算： [ text{曼哈顿距离} = |x_1 - c| + |x_2 - c| + ldots + |x_n - c| ] 切比雪夫距离是一种最大化距离度量方法，可以通过以下公式计算： [ text{切比雪夫距离} = max(|x_1 - c|, |x_2 - c|, ldots, |x_n - c|) ] 通过计算元素与数据中心的距禇，可以评估该元素与数据中心之间的偏离程度。您可以根据具体情况选择适合的距禇度量方法来计算偏离程度。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

私の見解では、資本主義的関係は近代法をつうじて特殊な権力テクノロジーを生み出す。このテクノロジーは、一方で、相互に個別化した主体の形成に含まれているが(主体化)、他方で、この個別者たちは相互に、ある困難な社会的限界に結びつけられている(強制力)。それは、社会関係の独自に自立化した形態なのであって、形態分析と関連させて法=権利形態と呼ぶことができる。(Buckel2007,211) フーコーが絶えず注意を促していたように、国家機関は権力システムの集中的な形態にすぎず、むしろその深層にある権力テクノロジーに着目しなければならない(Foucault2013,233)。それと同様に、マルクスの形態分析において重要なのは、国家の内容(暴力的支配)ではなく、法=権利の形態分析をつうじて経済的形態規定と政治的形態規定との絡み合いを把握することであった。法=権利は、資本主義的生産関係をたんに機能させるためのイデオロギー装置ではない。形態分析の課題は、そうした還元主義モデルに陥ることなく特定の権力関係として法=権利を把握することであった。つまり、法=権利関係は独自に政治的支配関係を構成するのであり、法=権利の形態規定がどのように機能するかが説明されなければならないのだ。「諸主体は、〔資本主義的な〕再生産過程においても、規律訓練および政治的かつ法学的に承認された個別化においても、相互に個人化されヒエラルヒー化されるが、同時に、法主体性を介して均質化される。この事態は、法=権利形態の機能様式にとって決定的に重要である」(Buckel2007,220)。”翻译为中文","output":"“即使在‘导出争论’中也被强调的一点是，现代法律系统并非仅是掩盖阶级统治的意识形态，而是构成统治和从属关系的，它是作为整体的资本主义社会系统内在的东西（Tuschling1976，47）。在资本主义社会中，法=权利的形式保证了由物化的生产关系必然产生的‘物的人格化’即所有权关系。通过此，不仅在直接生产过程的内部，也在其外部将各个人主体化为私人所有者及法律人格。德国政治理论家索妮亚·布克尔通过结合福柯的权力论与导出争论的形态分析，明确了这一点。 在我看来，资本主义关系通过现代法产生了一种特殊的权力技术。这技术一方面包含了构成相互个体化主体的内容（主体化），另一方面，这些个体相互之间被绑定在一个困难的社会限制之中（强制力）。这是社会关系的一种独立的形式，可以与形态分析一起称为法=权利的形式。（Buckel2007，211） 正如福柯不断警告的，国家机构只是权力系统的集中形式，并不是重点，反而是必须关注其中深层的权力技术（Foucault2013，233）。同样，在马克思的形态分析中重要的不是国家的内容（暴力统治），而是通过法=权利的形态分析来理解经济形态决定和政治形态决定的交织。法=权利不仅仅是让资本主义生产关系功能化的意识形态设备。形态分析的任务是，不陷入那种还原论模型，将法=权利作为一种特定的权力关系来理解。即，法=权利关系自身构成了一种独特的政治统治关系，必须解释法=权利的形态决定是如何功能化的。“在〔资本主义的〕再生产过程中，主体在纪律训练以及政治和法律认可的个体化中相互被个体化和层次化，但同时，通过法主体性被同质化。这一情况对法=权利形态的功能模式至关重要”（Buckel2007，220）。"},{"instruction":"请将“ブッケルが注目した法=権利形態がもつ諸機能は、「資本の生産過程」や「資本の蓄積過程」から生じる法ヮェティシズムを理解するうえで重要である。すでに見たように『資本論』第一巻ではまず私的労働にもとづく商品生産関係から経済的形態規定が導出されるが、その後で資本主義的生産関係が本格的に検討される。つまり、第二編「貨幣の資本への転化」以降では、第一編「商品と貨幣」では捨象されていた「生産手段」と「労働力」という物象およびその人格的担い手が初めて考察対象となる。貨幣という物象的権力にもとづいて生産手段を排他的に所有する資本家は、労働力を購入し消費することによって価値を自己増殖させる。一方、共同体と生産手段から引き剥がされた「無所有の」賃労働者は、自らの労働力を商品として販売し貨幣を手に入れることを強制される。このとき、両者は労働市場において人格的に自由で平等な私的所有者として対峙するのだが、マルクスはこの労働力売買における「物象の人格化」を第二編「貨幣の資本への転化」の末尾で次のように総括している。 労働力の売買が、その制限のなかで行なわれる流通または商品交換の部面は、じっさい、天賦人権のほんとうの楽園だった。ここで支配しているのは、ただ、自由、平等、所有、そしてベンサムである。自由!なぜならば、ある一つの商品たとえば労働力の買い手も売り手も、ただ彼らの自由な意志によって規定されているだけだから。彼らは、自由で法=権利的に対等な人格として契約する。契約は、彼らの意志がそれにおいて一つの共通な法的表現Rechtsausdruckを与えられる最終結果である。平等!なぜならば、彼らは、ただ商品所持者として互いに関係し合い、等価物と等価物とを交換するのだから。所有!なぜならば、どちらもただ自分のものを処分するだけだから。ベンサム!なぜならば、両者のどちらにとっても、かかわるところはただ自分のことだけだから。彼らをいっしょにして一つの関係のなかに置くただ一つの権力Machtは、彼らの自利の、彼らの特殊的利益の、彼らの私的利害の権力だけである。(MEGAII/6,191) マクファーソンは、この有名なテーゼ「自由・平等・所有、ベンサム」に依拠することで、ホッブズやロックといった近代の政治思想をポリテ・エコノミー批判の観点から捉え返し「所有的個人主義」という概念を提示した。この特異な個人主義によれば、個人が自己自身の人格および身体の所有者であり、そのような所有者である限りで個人の自由と平等が成立する(Macpherson1962,Pt.1)。しかし、この「所有的個人主義」はいわゆる自由主義段階の資本主義社会におけるブルジョワ・イデオロギーを意味しているわけではない。ハーバーマスはそう誤解しているが(Cf.Habermas1968,S.152)、マクファーソンの「所有的個人主義」論はむしろパシュカーニスの法=権利形態分析の文脈で理解する必要がある(Esser1975,167)。つまり、所有的個人主義とは、諸個人が自らの利害のみを追求する私的人格であるという資本主義社会における客体的思考形態なのだ。私たちは、法=権利の形態分析を経由することではじめて法イデオロギーに固有の次元を把握することができる。資本主義社会システムにおいて諸個人は「物象の人格化」としてのみならず法主体としてもふるまうのだが、その結果として法イデオロギーが諸個人の思考形態を客観的に支配せざるをえない。”翻译为中文","output":"布克尔关注的法=权利形态具有的各种功能，在理解“资本的生产过程”和“资本的积累过程”中产生的法律拜物教至关重要。正如我们已经看到的，在《资本论》第一卷中，首先从基于私人劳动的商品生产关系中导出经济形态规定，然后全面考察资本主义生产关系。也就是说，从第二编“货币向资本的转化”开始，首先考察的是在“商品与货币”第一编中被忽略的“生产资料”和“劳动力”这些物质及其人格化的承担者。基于物化权力的货币，拥有排他性控制生产资料的资本家，通过购买并消耗劳动力来实现价值的自我增殖。另一方面，与社区和生产资料分离的“无产”的雇佣劳动者被迫将自己的劳动力作为商品出售以获得货币。这时，双方在劳动市场上作为个人自由且平等的私人所有者对峙，但马克思在第二编“货币向资本的转化”的末尾总结了这种劳动力买卖中的“物的人格化”： 劳动力的买卖，在其限制内进行的流通或商品交换的方面实际上是真正的自然权利天堂。这里统治的仅是自由、平等、所有权以及边沁。自由！因为无论是劳动力的买方还是卖方，都仅由他们自由的意志所决定。他们作为自由且法=权利上平等的人格签署契约。契约是他们的意志在其中得到一个共同法律表达的最终结果。平等！因为他们只是作为商品持有者相互交往，交换等价物。所有权！因为双方仅是处理自己的物品。边沁！因为对双方来说，涉及的只是他们自己的事务。将他们结合在一起放入同一关系中的唯一权力是他们个人的利益、他们特定的利益、他们私人的利益之力。（MEGAII/6,191） 麦克法森通过依赖这一著名论点“自由、平等、所有权、边沁”，从政治经济学批判的角度重新把握了霍布斯、洛克等现代政治思想，并提出了“所有制个人主义”这一概念。按照这种特殊的个人主义，个人作为自身人格及身体的所有者，而作为这样的所有者，个人的自由和平等得以实现（Macpherson1962,Pt.1）。然而，这种“所有制个人主义”并不意味着所谓自由主义阶段的资本主义社会中的资产阶级意识形态。哈贝马斯误解了这一点（参见Habermas1968,S.152），麦克法森的“所有制个人主义”论实际上需要在帕什卡尼斯的法=权利形态分析的背景下来理解（Esser1975,167）。也就是说，所有制个人主义是指个人作为追求自己利益的私人人格，在资本主义社会中的一种客观的思维形态。我们只有通过法=权利形态分析，才能最初地把握到法意识形态所特有的维度。在资本主义社会系统中，个人不仅作为“物的人格化”行动，而且还作为法律主体行动，其结果是法意识形态不可避免地客观地支配着个人的思维形态。"},{"instruction":"请将“資本主義社会において物象的関係は、「物象の人格化」が必然的に帯びる「法=権利形態」を媒介として、「物象の人格化」が必然的に帯びる「法=権利形態」を媒介として、直接的および社会的生産関係において独自の支配・従属関係を生み出す。くりかえし強調してきたように、端緒的な政治的形態規定は、共同体にもとづく人格的な支配・従属関係ではなく「物象の人格化」という法学的次元において生成する。その結果、諸個人は、生産手段を所有していようがいまいが、生まれながらに法的人格、法的主体という自然属性をもっているという法学的観念が生じる。この法フェティシズムは、たんに虚偽意識を生み出すばかりか、法イデオロギーとして体系化されて客体的な思考形態となる。つまり、「自由・平等・所有、ベンサム」は、単なる虚偽意識ではなく、客体的に実在的な支配関係、すなわち法主体を構成する権力関係として理解する必要があるのだ。じじつ、マルクス自身もまた「自由と平等」を単なる仮象ではなく、経済的形態を「別の次元で」表現した「交換の法学的形態」(MEGAII/2,57)として規定している。「自由と平等とは、純粋な諸理念としては、交換価値の過程のさまざまの契機が理念化した諸表現であり、また法学的、政治的および社会的な諸関連において展開されたものとしては、それらはただ〔経済とは〕別のポテンツにおいて再生産されたものにすぎない」(ibid.,60)。それゆえ、「所有的個人主義」の「自由と平等」もまた、しばしば誤解されているように経済的形態規定を隠蔽するという意味での法観念ではない。経済的形態規定は「物象の人格化」という法学的次元において「自由と平等のシステム」を生み出し、その結果として必然的に生じる法イデオロギーが諸個人の思考形態を支配するのだ。 「法=権利の転回」としての「領有法則の転回」論 マルクスは、資本主義社会システムにおいて「所有、自由および平等そのものが折あるごとにそれらの反対物に転変する」ことを強調している(ibid,61)。この有名な「領有法則の転回」論は『資本論』第一巻第二二章(フランス語版では第二四章)「剰余価値の資本への転化」において展開されたものだが、エンゲルス版以降のテクストにおいてドイツ語第二版とフランス語版が最も混合され編集された箇所である。ここではその要点を法=権利の形態分析の観点から再構成しておきたい。すでに見たように、資本主義社会システムにおいて諸個人の所有関係は物象的関係を媒介としてはじめて成立する。つまり、分裂した私的個人の「所有の正当性」すなわち私的所有権Eigentumsrechtは、法律や国家権力ではなく物象的関係によって基礎づけられるほかない。マルクスによれば、こうした「商品生産に適合する所有権droitdepropriété」が資本主義社会おいては「他人労働を領有する法=権利」へと必然的に転化するという(MEGAII/7,508-9)。それは次のような事情からである。 労働力を欲する資本家と貨幣を欲する賃労働者が売買契約を結ぶ場合、両者は人格的に自由で平等な私的所有者として等価な物象を互いに交換する。しかし、「商品生産の所有法則」にしたがって等価交換が行われた結果、この等価交換という「公正なgerecht諸法則」から「他人fremd労働の果実にたいする資本の永遠の法=権利Rechtが導出される」ことになる(MEGAII/1.2,407)。なぜなら、資本家が労働力商品の使用(消費)によって他人労働の成果を領有することができる一方で、賃労働者は自らの労働の成果を領有する可能性を奪われ、無所有者として労働力の販売を強制され続けるからである。こうして資本家階級は、物象化した生産関係から必然的に生じる「商品生産の所有法則」にしたがって、全く正当に労働者階級の剰余労働を搾取することができる。ドイツ語第二版では、「商品生産の所有法則」の資本主義的領有法則への転回が弁証法的に説明されている。 ”翻译为中文","output":"在资本主义社会中，物化的关系通过“物的人格化”所必然附带的“法=权利形态”作为媒介，在直接及社会生产关系中产生独特的统治和从属关系。就像我们一再强调的，初步的政治形态规定，并不是基于共同体的个人之间的统治和从属关系，而是在“物的人格化”的法学维度中生成。其结果是，无论个人是否拥有生产资料，都将产生一种法学观念，即个人天生拥有法律人格、法律主体这一自然属性。这种法律拜物教不仅产生虚假意识，而且作为法律意识形态体系化，成为客观的思维形态。也就是说，“自由、平等、拥有权、边沁”不应仅被视为虚假意识，而需要作为实际存在的统治关系，即构成法律主体的权力关系来理解。事实上，马克思自己也将“自由和平等”规定为不仅仅是幻象，而是在“另一个维度”中表现的经济形态的“交换的法学形态”（MEGAII/2,57）。 “自由和平等作为纯粹的理念，是交换价值过程中各种契机的理念化表达，以及在法学、政治和社会相关领域中展开的，它们不过是在另一个潜能中被再生产的”（ibid.,60）。因此，“所有制个人主义”的“自由和平等”，并非如常误解的那样，是掩盖经济形态规定的法律观念。经济形态规定在“物的人格化”的法学维度中产生“自由和平等的体系”，并由此产生的法律意识形态必然支配个人的思维形态。 作为“法=权利转向”的“所有权法则的转变”论 马克思强调，在资本主义社会系统中，“所有权、自由以及平等本身会不时地转变为它们的相反物”（ibid,61）。这个著名的“所有权法则的转变”论在《资本论》第一卷第二十二章（法语版中为第二十四章）“剩余价值向资本的转化”中展开，是在恩格斯版本之后的文本中，德语第二版和法语版被最多结合编辑的部分。这里我们希望从法=权利形态分析的角度对其要点进行重构。正如我们已经看到的，在资本主义社会系统中，个人的所有权关系首先是通过物化的关系来建立的。也就是说，分裂的私人个体的“所有权的正当性”即私有权，不是由法律或国家权力而是由物化关系所基础。马克思指出，在资本主义社会中，“适用于商品生产的所有权droitdepropriété”将必然转变为“拥有他人劳动的法=权利”（MEGAII/7,508-9）。这是由于以下情况：当寻求劳动力的资本家与渴求货币的雇佣劳动者签订买卖合同时，双方作为个人自由且平等的私人所有者，相互交换等价的物化对象。然而，根据“商品生产的所有权规则”所进行的等价交换的结果，这种“公正的諸法则”导致“对他人fremd劳动成果的永久法=权利Recht”得以推导出来（MEGAII/1.2,407）。因为资本家可以通过使用（消费）劳动力商品来拥有他人劳动的成果，而雇佣劳动者则被剥夺了拥有自己劳动成果的可能性，被迫持续作为无产者销售自己的劳动力。这样，资本家阶级可以完全合法地按照从物化生产关系必然产生的“商品生产的所有权规则”来剥削工人阶级的剩余劳动。在德语第二版中，“商品生产的所有权规则”向资本主义的占有法则的转变被辩证法地解释。"},{"instruction":"请将“剰余資本第一号を形作る剰余価値が、原資本の一部分による労働力の購入の成果であって、この購入が商品交換の諸法則に照応する限りでは、[…]また、剰余資本第二号などが剰余資本第一号の成果にすぎず、したがってあの最初の関係の帰結である限りでは、[…]商品生産および商品流通にもとづく領有法則または私的所有の法則は、明らかに、それ自身の内的で不可避な弁証法によって、その正反対物に転回する。最初の操作として現れた等価物どうしの交換は、一転して、外観Schein的にのみ交換が行われるようになる。[…]したがって、資本家と労働者のあいだの交換関係は、流通過程に属する外観にすぎないものとなり、内容そのものとは疎遠な、内容を神秘化するにすぎない単なる形態になる。〔〕本源的には、所有権Eigentumsrechtは、自分の労働にもとづくものとして現れた。少なくとも、この仮定が妥当とされなければならなかった。なぜなら、平等な権利をもつ商品所持者たちだけが相対するのであって、他人の商品を領有するための手段は分の商品を譲渡することだけであり、そして自分の商品はただ労働によってのみ生産されうるものだからである。所有は、いまや、資本家の側では他人の不払労働またはその生産物を領有する法=権利として現われ、労働者の側では自分自身の生産物を領有することの不可能性として現われる。所有と労働の分離は、外観的にはscheinbar両者の同一性から生じた一法則の必然的帰結となる。(MEGAII/6,S.537-8) この箇所は、エンゲルスによって編集された現行版とは異なり、フランス語版ではマルクス自身によってそもそも削除されてしまった。ドイツ語第二版とフランス語版を比較検討することは、法=権利形態と法イデオロギーの関係を理解する上で重要である。第二版においては「最初の操作として等価物同士の交換」が、「流通過程に属するたんなる外観に、内容そのものとは疎遠で内容を神秘化するにすぎない形態になる」ことに力点がある。しかし、このような外観批判を強調する弁証法的展開においては、「商品生産の所有法則」にしたがった等価交換と、「商品生産の所有法則」から必然的に生じる観念、すなわち「自己労働にもとづく所有」幻想との関係が曖昧になってしまっている(佐々木2021,325)じじつ日本の先行研究においても、「領有法則の転回」論は、もっぱら後者の「自己労働にもとづく所有」の幻想性を糾弾したものとして解釈される傾向にあった。すなわち、資本の蓄積過程においては、古典派経済学者がイデオロギー的に擁護するような「商品生産の所有法則」が失効し、資本主義的な領有法則が展開するというのである。しかし、フランス語版ではむしろ弁証法的な説明がなくなり、第二版での「外観」批判が後景に退いている。 この致富の方法は、商品生産の最初の法則とこれほど奇異な対照をなしているとはいえ、この法則の侵害から生じるのではなく、逆にこの法則の適用から生じる、ということを十分把握しなければならない。[…]したがって、貨幣の資本への最初の転化は、商品生産の経済的諸法則とそこから派生する所有の法=権利に従って行われる。[…] 単純再生産は、第一の操作を周期的に反復するにすぎない。だから、反復のつど、単純再生産は、貨幣の資本への最初の転化となる。法則の作用が連続するということは、確かに、この法則が侵害されるということの反対である。(MEGAII/7,S.506-7) 外観や弁証法といった用語が消失したのは、エンゲルスがそう理解したように、マルクスによる「平易化」を意味しているわけではない。この平易化にはむしろ理論的に重要な含意を読み取るべきである。つまり、資本の蓄積過程においては、等価交換の絶えざる反復こそが「領有法則の転回」をもたらすという点である。「商品生産の所有法則」は、単なる「自己労働にもとづく所有」という幻想なのではなく、現実の蓄積過程においても絶えず作用しつづける。つまり、いわば幻想やイデオロギーを必要とするまでもなく、「商品生産の所有法則」反復的な適用によって資本主義的な領有が正当化されるのだ。こうして所有権という法学的次元において「商品生産に適合する所有の法=権利」が「他人労働を領有する法=権利」へと絶えず転回することになる。それゆえ、マルクスの「領有法則の転回」論は、まさしく「法=権利の転回」論としても理解されなければならないのだ。”翻译为中文","output":"构成剩余资本一号的剩余价值是原资本的一部分通过购买劳动力的结果，这种购买在遵循商品交换的各项法则的范围内，[...]

这一部分内容，在由恩格斯编辑的现行版中有所不同，并且在法语版中被马克思本人最初删除了。比较德语第二版和法语版，对于理解法=权利形态与法意识形态的关系非常重要。在第二版中，“作为最初操作的等价物之间的交换”变成“仅属于流通过程的外观，与内容本身相距甚远，仅是神秘化内容的形式”的重点。然而，在这种强调外观批判的辩证法发展中，“基于商品生产的所有权法则”的等价交换和由此必然产生的观念，即“基于自我劳动的所有权”的幻想之间的关系变得模糊（佐崎2021,325）。事实上，在日本的先期研究中，\\"所有权法则的转变\\"论主要被解释为批判\\"基于自我劳动的所有权\\"的幻想性。即在资本积累过程中，经典经济学家所意识形态地维护的“商品生产的所有权法则”失效，资本主义的所有权法则得以展开。然而，在法语版中，反而消失了辩证法的解释，第二版中的“外观”批判被置于后景。 必须充分理解，这种致富方式与商品生产的最初法则形成了如此奇异的对比，不是因为违反了这一法则，而是相反，因为应用了这一法则。[...] 因此，货币向资本的最初转化是按照商品生产的经济法则及由此派生的所有权法=权利进行的。[...] 简单再生产仅仅是周期性重复第一次操作。因此，每次重复，简单再生产成为了货币向资本的最初转化。法则的持续作用确实是，这条法则被侵犯的反面。（MEGAII/7,S.506-7） 术语“外观”和“辩证法”的消失，并不意味着如恩格斯所理解的那样马克思的“简化”。这种“简化”实际上应当从理论上理解其重要含义。即在资本积累过程中，等价交换的不断重复恰恰导致了“所有权法则的转变”。 “商品生产的所有权法则”不仅仅是“基于自我劳动的所有权”的幻想，而是在实际的积累过程中也不断发挥作用。也就是说，无需幻想或意识形态的支持，通过“商品生产的所有权法则”的反复应用，资本主义的所有权得以正当化。因此，在法律学维度中，“适应商品生产的所有权法=权利”不断地转变为“拥有他人劳动的法=权利”。因此，马克思的“所有权法则的转变”论，正是必须作为“法=权利转变”论来理解。"},{"instruction":"请将“ここでもパシュカーニスが論じた法=権利形態と法観念(その体系化としての法イデオロギー)の区別が決定的に重要である。「商品生産の所有法則」にしたがって等価物を交換する私的人格は、実際に人格的に自由で平等な法主体として現象する。つまり、資本家と賃労働者の「平等かつ自由な関係」はたんに「ひとを欺く外観Schein」を意味するだけではない(MEGAI/2,372)。もちろん、「ロックからリカードに至るまでの一般の法学的観念」(MEGAII/4.1,134)に見られたように、「物象の人格化」としての「自由・平等」は、資本と賃労働の搾取関係を隠蔽するイデオロギーとして機能する。マルクスも「諸結果」でこう述べている。「イデオロギー的・法学的には、労働に基づく私的所有というイデオロギーが、直ちに、直接的生産者の収奪〔脱所有化]に基づく所有へと転用される」(ibid.,135)。しかし、認識論的な錯覚は、法イデオロギーがもつ機能の片面にすぎない。他方でこのような「所有的個人主義」は、法イデオロギーとして体系化されて客体的な思考形態となり、諸個人を法的人格として主体化するようにして機能するのだ。じじつ、「商品生産の所有法則」にしたがった等価交換は、法学的には「物象の人格化」として自由で平等な法主体どうしの契約関係として現象するほかない。「労働能力の販売は、この第一の過程〔資本が貨幣として労働力が商品として機能する形態的過程]では理念的にまたは法学的に行なわれる」(MEGA11/3.6,2170)。そして、この等価な物象の交換過程と同時に、「第二の過程」である「資本の生産過程」においても「物象の人格化」にもとづく支配・従属関係が生成する。マルクスは、資本の蓄積および再生産過程を論じる文脈においても、法的人格としての主体化作用が実在的に貫徹することを示唆している。 すなわちここでは、この労働諸条件が、労働者の人格にたいして、資本家という人格のかたちをとって、固有の意志と利害とをもった諸人格化として対立するのであり、言い換えれば、労働諸条件が、労働者にたいして疎遠な所有として、他の法学的人格の実在性として、この人格の意志の絶対的領域として、対立するのであって、だから他方では、労働が、資本家に人格化した価値すなわち労働諸条件に対立する疎遠な労働として、現象する。(ibid.,2238) このように、法=権利の形態規定は、交換過程あるいは流通部面のみならず、直接的生産過程や資本の蓄積過程においても貫徹する。したがって、パシュカーニスによる法=権利の形態分析は、たんに法=権利が資本と賃労働の搾取関係を隠蔽するという仮象性を強調したものではない。マルクスの「領有法則の転回」論のポイントは、フランス語版で強調されたように、等価交換および商品生産に適合する所有権の絶えざる反復にあった。この等価交換の繰り返しが、同時に資本の蓄積過程において「物象の人格化」にもとづく支配・従属関係を再生産する。それは、法=権利の形態分析という観点からみると、「所有的個人主義」という法イデオロギーが、諸個人を法的人格すなわち私的所有者として絶えず主体化するということを意味しているのだ。 もっとも、等価交換の反復性が強調されたフランス語版においても「自己労働にもとづく所有」という幻想にたいする批判が完全に無くなったわけではない。このことも、現行版を参照するのではなく、第二版とフランス語版を比較することで確認できるだろう。先に引用した第二版の引用文中に付与された注記において、マルクスは次のように述べている。「商品生産が一定の発展程度において必然的に資本主義的商品生産となる―――むしろ資本主義的生産様式の基礎上でのみ、商品は生産物の一般的、支配的形態となるのだが――のと全く同様に、商品生産の所有法則は必然的に資本主義的領有法則に転回する。それゆえ、商品生産の所有法則を有効ならしめることによって資本主義的所有を廃止しようとする、プルードンのずるさは驚くべきものである!」(MEGA11/6,S.538)。フランス語版ではプルードンに関する最後の文章が次のように修正されている。「ある種の社会主義学派が、資本の体制に商品生産の永遠の諸法則を適用することによって、資本の体制を破壊することができると思い込んでいるのは、なんという幻想illusionであろうか!」(MEGA11/7,S.509)”翻译为中文","output":"在这里，帕什卡尼斯讨论的法=权利形式与法观念（作为法意识形态的体系化）之间的区分是至关重要的。“商品生产的所有权法则”根据等价物的交换，私人人格实际上作为具有人格自由和平等的法律主体而出现。也就是说，资本家与雇佣劳动者的“平等且自由的关系”不仅仅意味着“欺人的外观Schein”（MEGAI/2,372）。当然，如同“从洛克到李嘉图的一般法律观念”（MEGAII/4.1,134）所展示的，“物的人格化”作为“自由与平等”，作为隐藏资本与雇佣劳动的剥削关系的意识形态而起作用。马克思在“各种结果”中也提到，“从意识形态和法律学上讲，基于劳动的私人所有权这一意识形态立即得以转为基于直接生产者的剥削[脱赋权]的所有权。”（ibid.,135）。然而，认识论上的错觉仅仅是法意识形态功能的一方面。另一方面，这样的“所有权个人主义”作为法意识形态被系统化为客观的思维形式，并且作用于将个人作为法律人格即私人所有者主体化。实际上，“商品生产的所有权法则”依照的等价物交换，在法学上不得不作为“物的人格化”，即自由平等法律主体间的契约关系出现。“劳动力的销售在这第一过程[资本作为货币、劳动力作为商品功能的形式过程]中在理念上或法律上进行。”（MEGA11/3.6,2170）。同时，在“第二过程”，即“资本的生产过程”中，也会产生基于“物的人格化”的支配与从属关系。马克思在讨论资本的积累及再生产过程的语境中，也暗示了作为法律人格的主体化作用实际上的穿透。 即在这里，劳动条件以资本家这一人格的形式，作为带有自有意志和利益的人格化与劳动者的人格对立，换句话说，劳动条件作为对劳动者陌生的所有权，作为其他法律人格的实际性，作为这一人格意志的绝对领域对立，因此另一方面，劳动作为对立于劳动条件的陌生劳动，以资本家人格化的价值即劳动条件出现。（ibid.,2238） 因此，法=权利的形态规定不仅在交换过程或流通部分中贯穿，也在直接生产过程和资本的积累过程中贯穿。因此，帕什卡尼斯的法=权利形态分析不仅仅强调法=权利隐藏资本和雇佣劳动的剥削关系的幻象性。马克思的“所有权法则的转变”论的重点，如法语版所强调的，是等价交换和适应商品生产的所有权反复无常的重复。这种等价交换的重复，同时也在资本的积累过程中再生产基于“物的人格化”的支配与从属关系。从法=权利形态分析的角度来看，这意味着“所有权个人主义”这一法意识形态，不断地以私人所有者即法律人格的形式主体化个人。 即使在强调了等价交换反复性的法语版中，“基于自身劳动的所有权”的幻想批评也并非完全消失。比较第二版和法语版，可以确认这一点。在前面引用的第二版中的注解中，马克思表述为，“商品生产在一定发展阶段上必然成为资本主义商品生产——只有在资本主义生产方式的基础上，商品才成为一般的、支配的形式——正如商品生产的所有权法则必然转变为资本主义所有权法则一样。因此，普鲁东企图通过使商品生产的所有权法则有效来废除资本主义所有权，这种诡计是令人惊讶的！”（MEGA11/6,S.538）。在法语版中，关于普鲁东的最后一句被修正为：“某些社会主义学派认为通过应用商品生产的永恒法则于资本体系，可以破坏资本体系，这是多么的幻想！”（MEGA11/7,S.509）"},{"instruction":"请将“プルードンの「ずるさ」や「思い込み」は単なる認識論的誤謬ではなく、資本主義を批判する「社会主義者」さえもが陥る法フェティシズムであった。すでに見たように、マルクスのポリティカル・エコノミー批判が、プルードンやリカード左派といった「社会主義学派」にたいする批判を含んでいたことを忘れてはならない。プルードンはあくまでも商品生産ならびに商品交換のシステムを残したまま、そしてリカード左派は等価交換から生じる法観念に依拠することで、資本のシステムを変革しようとする。これに対してマルクスは、商品生産・交換システムはもちろん、経済学的フェティシズムや法観念を資本主義社会システムの構成部分として理解している。パシュカーニスが「社会主義革命」後に法学批判を洗練させる必要があった理由を今一度思い起こしてほしい。それは、物象化した社会関係それ自体を変革することなく、「社会主義国家」建設を正当化しようとするソビエト法学者を批判するためであった。法フェティシズムは、資本主義とそのイデオローグたる経済学者を批判する社会主義者の思考形態さえも徹底して支配する。それゆえ、神秘化をもたらす等価交換という「外観」にたいする批判は、社会主義者の「幻想」にたいするイデオロギー批判として理解されるべきなのだ。マルクスのイデオロギー批判は、経済学者にたいする批判のみならず、むしろそれを批判する社会主義者が彼らと共有する法ィデオロギーにたいする批判なのである。 「国家を取り戻す」? 第一章で見たように、「導出論争」の参加者たちは『資本論』の経済的カテゴリーから国家を論理的に展開することに執着したために国家の歴史的発展を看過していると批判されてきた。ドイツのマルクス主義歴史学者であるハイデ・ゲルステンベルガーは論争当時から、たんに資本主義の機能として国家を把握する還元主義モデルを厳しく批判していたが、一九八〇年代以降は「国家の歴史社会学」を批判的に摂取するようになる。ここでの「国家の歴史社会学」とは、一九七〇年代以降のアメリカにおいて、ネオ・マルクス主義やネオ・コーポラティズムの理論的影響を受けながら発展した潮流を指している。二〇世紀前半には、ドイツの歴史法学者オットー・ギールケに影響を受けたメイトランドやラスキ、そしてギルド社会主義者のホブソンやコールといった論者が多元主義国家論を展開していた(Vincent1987,189)。同世紀後半になっても、イーストンの「政治システム論」にも見られるように、国家概念を放逐することがトレンドとなっていたのである(Barrelson2001,Ch.3)。それに対して、アメリカの政治学者シーダ・スコチポルは、「国家の相対的自律性」を強調するネオ・マルクス主義を摂取することで、政治学において「国家を取り戻す」べく「国家論の復権」を唱えたのであった(Skocpol1985)。 マルクス主義国家論争が終息した八〇年代以降には、歴史社会学的なアプローチの国家論が著しく発展していた。スコチポルと同時代に、社会学の領域でヴェーバー以降の国家論を大きく進展させたのがチャールズ・ティリーである。ティリーは、一六世紀以降の西ヨーロッパ諸国間で戦争が継続的に展開したことに着目し、一定の領域を統治する近代国家は、軍事=財政システムの競争関係を背景として形成されてきたと主張した(Tilly1975)。彼のテーゼは、「国家が戦争をおこない、戦争が国家をつくりあげた」に集約される。つまり、強制力coercionの組織化と戦争への準備を国家分析の中心に据えることで、国家間関係が国家形成の全過程におおきな影響を与えたことを強調したのである(Tilly1990,Ch.1)。ティリーによれば、ヨーロッパに限っても、帝国・都市国家(都市連合)・領域国家という三つの異なるタイプが長い間併存してきたという。それゆえ、国家の歴史的発展を把握するうえで、一九世紀以降に支配的となった国民国家nationstateを過去に投影すべきではない。じじつ、一九世紀に成立した国民国家は、一六世紀以降に優勢となった領域国家すなわち国民的国家nationalstateと区別されるのだ。このようにティリーに代表される「国家の社会学」は現代でも大きな影響力をもち、伝統的なマルクス主義国家論の経済主義・階級還元論モデルにたいする強力な反論となっている。”翻译为中文","output":"普鲁东的“奸诈”和“误解”并非单纯的认识论错误，而是即使批判资本主义的“社会主义者”也会陷入的法律拜物教。如我们所见，马克思对政治经济学的批判包含了对普鲁东和李嘉图左翼等“社会主义学派”的批评，绝不能忘记。普鲁东固执于保留商品生产及商品交换的体系，而李嘉图左翼则试图通过依赖等价交换产生的法律观念来改变资本体系。相反，马克思认为，商品生产和交换体系，当然，包括经济学的拜物教和法律观念，被理解为构成资本主义社会系统的一部分。应该再次思考帕什卡尼斯有必要完善“社会主义革命”后的法学批评的原因。这是为了批判试图在不改变物质化的社会关系的情况下，为“社会主义国家”的建设正当化的苏联法学家。法律拜物教深刻地支配着批评资本主义及其经济学家的社会主义者的思维模式。因此，对等价交换带来的神秘化“外观”的批评，应该被理解为针对社会主义者“幻想”的意识形态批判。马克思的意识形态批判，不仅针对经济学家，而且针对批评他们的社会主义者，共享着与他们相同的法律意识形态的批判。 “夺回国家”? 正如第一章所见，“导出争论”的参与者因过分专注于从《资本论》的经济类别逻辑上展开国家，而忽视了国家的历史发展，因此受到批评。德国的马克思主义历史学家海德·格尔斯滕伯格自争论时起，就严厉批判仅将国家视为资本主义功能的还原论模型，但自1980年代起，开始批判性地吸收“国家的历史社会学”。这里的“国家的历史社会学”是指1970年代以后在美国发展起来的，受到新马克思主义和新企业主义理论影响的潮流。20世纪前半叶，受德国历史法学家奥托·吉尔克影响的梅特兰德和拉斯基，以及公社社会主义者霍布森和科尔等人，展开了多元主义国家论（Vincent1987,189）。即使到了20世纪后半叶，如伊斯顿的“政治系统论”所示，排除国家概念成为趋势（Barrelson2001,Ch.3）。相对地，美国政治学家希达·斯科奇波尔，通过吸收新马克思主义强调“国家的相对自主性”，在政治学中主张“夺回国家”的“国家论复兴”（Skocpol1985）。 马克思主义国家论争结束后的80年代，国家的历史社会学方法论的国家论显著发展。与斯科奇波尔同时代，在社会学领域大幅推进韦伯以来国家论的是查尔斯·蒂利。蒂利注意到自16世纪以来西欧国家之间持续展开的战争，主张在一定范围内统治的近代国家是在军事-财政系统竞争关系的背景下形成的（Tilly1975）。他的论点可以概括为“国家进行战争，战争塑造国家”。即通过将强制力组织和战争准备置于国家分析的中心，强调国家间关系在国家形成全过程中的重大影响（Tilly1990,Ch.1）。蒂利指出，即使局限于欧洲，帝国、城邦（城市联盟）、领土国家这三种不同类型长期并存。因此，在理解国家的历史发展时，不应将19世纪以后成为主导的民族国家概念投射到过去。实际上，19世纪形成的民族国家，区别于16世纪以来占优势的领土国家即民族国家。蒂利所代表的“国家的社会学”至今仍有巨大影响力，成为对传统马克思主义国家论的经济主义、阶级还原论模型的有力反驳。"},{"instruction":"请将“ところで、導出論争後の九〇年代にドイツで出版されたゲルステンベルガーの主著『主体なき権力ョワ国家権力の生成に関する理論』(本書では第二版Gerstenberger2006を参照)は、英語圏にも翻訳されるなどマルクス主義理論の内外で高い評価を受けている。ゲルステンベルガーの国家論は、「国家の社会学」や比較歴史学のらず、ミッタイス、ヒンツェ、ブロックといった法制史や社会史の膨大な成果を取り入れている。しかし、日本の政治学・社会学においては、八〇年代以降に日本のマルクス研究が衰退したこともあいまって、スコチポルやティリーを中心とする「ネオ・ヴェーバー主義」や歴史的制度論が紹介されるにとどまっている。ゲルステンベルガーは、ヒルシュとならんでマルクス主義国家論を刷新した数少ない論者の一人であるにもかかわらず、日本では全く言及されてこなかったのだ。その意味で本章は、ゲルステンベルガーが独自にうち立てた近代国家論を体系的に紹介することを目的としている。 導出論争の当事者でもあったゲルステンベルガーは、ネオ・ヴェーバー主義の「国家の歴史社会学」とは異なり、「政治と経済の分離および結合」を把握するマルクスの形態分析を否定しているわけではない。むしろゲルステンベルガーは、ホロウェイと同様に形態分析の現代的意義を強調してさえいる(Gerstenberger2007)。しかし、国家導出の抽象性は、ヒルシュにとってレギュラシオン理論にもとづいて克服されなければならなかったのと同様に、ゲルステンベルガーにとって歴史社会学や法制史の研究成果にもとづいて克服すべきものだった。ゲルステンベルガーによれば、資本主義の特徴とされる「政治と経済の分離」は、マルクスが『資本論』で展開したイングランドにおける「本源的蓄積」に由来するわけではない。重要なのは、資本主義の成立に先だって、「アンシャン・レジーム」という西ヨーロッパに特殊な社会構造から近代国家が形成されてきたという点である。つまり、「私的所有を保証するために国家は形式的な中立性を帯びる」(Blankeetal.1974)という導出論争の主要テーゼは、資本主義国家それ自体ではなく、あくまでも西洋産業社会に固有な「ブルジョワ国家BürgerlicherStaat」を前提としているにすぎないのだ。したがって、導出論争において看過されたことだが、ブルジョワ国家と資本主義国家、別の言い方では、近代国家と「資本の国家」は明確に区別されなければならないのである。ゲルステンベルガーは、「政治と経済の分離」という国家の形態規定性が、あくまでも資本主義社会システムの前提条件にすぎず、資本主義国家それ自体の政治的形態を定義したものではないと結論づけている。導出論争で展開された「国家の形態分析」を、ゲルステンベルガーはいわば歴史主義的に修正したというわけだ。 本章ではまず、マルクスのポリティカル・エコノミー批判における「歴史的考察」の位置づけをふまえたうえで、非歴史的であるとしばしば批判されてきた「形態分析」の内容を再度確認しておく。そして、マルクスの「7ランス三部作」や『資本論』「本源的蓄積論」を素材としながら、資本主義社会システムに先行する近代国家の歴史的起源と、近代国家の「資本の国家」への移行について考察する。その際私たちは、ゲルステンベルガーによるブルジョワ国家と資本主義国家の区別が、国家の形態分析においてどのような意味をもっているかに着目するだろう。 ポリティカル・エコノミー批判における形態分析と歴史的考察 ホロウェイらの「開かれたマルクス主義」は九〇年代以降も形態分析の現代的意義を改めて主張してきたが、階級支配や資本と賃労働の敵対的関係を強調するヒルシュとならんで、国家の歴史的発展を重視するゲルステンベルガーを高く評価している(Bonefeldetal.1992a,Intro)。そもそも、資本主義国家の歴史的展開を分析すること(歴史分析)と、資本主義国家の政治的形態そのものを分析すること(形態分析)は、導出論争において常に大きな論争点となっていた。論争時ブランケらは形態分析と歴史分析を厳密に区別したが、ヒルシュやホロウェイはむしろ両者の一体性を強調している。彼らは、もっぱら商品生産関係や所有関係から法=権利形態を導出するブランケらを批判し、資本主義的生産関係の歴史的プロセスを強調した。ホロウェイはさらに議論を一歩進めて、資本の蓄積および再生産過程から国家機能を導出するうえで、歴史分析は形態分析に内在するとまで主張したのである。ところで、形態分析と歴史分析の不可分性を強調したのは、第一章で見たように「マルクスの新しい読み方」潮流の先駆者であるロスドルスキーであった。当のロスドルスキーはエンゲルスの「論理=歴史」説に依拠していたと考えられている。エンゲルスが定式化した歴史分析と論理分析の関係は、『資本論』研究史においても大きな争点となってきたのでここで取り上げておくに値するだろう。エンゲルスは、『ダス・フォルク』(一八五九年)に掲載された「マルクス『経済学批判。第一分冊』の書評」において次のように述べている。”翻译为中文","output":"普鲁东的“狡猾”和“误解”不仅仅是认识论上的错误，实际上是即使是批判资本主义的“社会主义者”也会陷入的法律拜物教。正如我们所见，马克思对政治经济学的批评包括了对普鲁东和李嘉图左翼等“社会主义学派”的批判，这是不应该忘记的。普鲁东坚持保留商品生产及商品交换系统，而李嘉图左翼试图通过依赖等价交换产生的法律观念来变革资本系统。与之相对，马克思认为，商品生产交换系统，当然还包括经济学的拜物教和法律观念被理解为构成资本主义社会系统的一部分。让我们再次思考帕什卡尼斯有必要完善“社会主义革命”后的法学批评的原因。这是为了批判试图不改变物化的社会关系就为“社会主义国家”的建设正当化的苏联法学家。法律拜物教深入支配着批评资本主义及其经济学家的社会主义者的思维模式。因此，对等价交换所带来的神秘化“外观”的批判应被理解为针对社会主义者“幻想”的意识形态批判。马克思的意识形态批判不仅针对经济学家，而且针对那些批评他们的社会主义者，这些社会主义者分享了与他们相同的法律意识形态。

“导出争论”结束后的80年代，历史社会学方法论的国家论显著发展。与斯科奇波尔同时代，查尔斯·蒂利在社会学领域大幅推进了韦伯以来的国家论。蒂利注意到自16世纪以来西欧国家间持续不断的战争，认为控制一定领域的现代国家是在军事-财政系统的竞争关系背景下形成的（Tilly1975）。他的论点可以归纳为“国家发动战争，战争造就了国家”。通过将强制力的组织和战争准备置于国家分析的核心，强调了国家间关系对国家形成过程的重大影响（Tilly1990,Ch.1）。蒂利指出，即使仅限于欧洲，帝国、城邦（城市联盟）、领土国家三种不同类型长期并存。因此，在理解国家的历史发展时，不应将19世纪以后成为主导的民族国家概念投影到过去。事实上，19世纪形成的民族国家，与16世纪以来占主导的领土国家即民族国家有所区别。蒂利所代表的“国家的社会学”至今仍具有巨大影响力，成为对传统马克思主义国家论的经济主义、阶级还原论模型的有力反驳。"},{"instruction":"Hello","output":"Hello!

Although the DPRK never annexes the Republic of Korea in South Korea and [the DPRK] subsequently form the Greater Korean Republic [Homefront] in 2014 after the withdrawal of all United States military forces in South Korea due to economic troubles in the USA like in the canon Homefront franchise, Japan, which [Japan] embraced a combination of the feudal governance of the shogunate and modern imperial governance in 1868 Meiji Restoration instead of fully abolishing the shogunate like in real life, although it [Japan] still lost the Pacific War of 1933-1947 like in OTL although the shoguns and Japanese imperial family managed to keep their positions post-WW2, who [Japan] continued on its [Japan's] economic, industrial and cultural growth from the 1950s-early 2010s and [Japan] never experienced the \\"Lost Decade\\" and [Japan] continued on its [Japan's] path towards [Japan] becoming not only a regional superpower within East Asia but also a global superpower, the hyperpower of a Japanocentric unipolar world order with the US following Japanese strategy in East Asia with anti-Japanese sentiment in both the DPRK and ROK being non-existent due to the pro-Japanese democracy movement in the ROK after the fall of the military junta of the Fourth Republic of Korea in South Korea in 1988 to the Minjung pro Democracy movement spreading to the DPRK, with the USA, the CCP-ruled PRC in mainland China and the USSR and post-Soviet Russia being unable to covertly promote anti-Japanese sentiment in both the DPRK and ROK due to the Russian Civil War resuming after the Soviet fall in 1991 and the USA essentially becoming a third world country after the 2008 economic crisis, [Japan] instead manages to negotiate peace between KMT remnants and Taiwanese independence supporters in the once KMT-ruled Nationalist China/Second Chinese Republic in exile on Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, [Japan] managing to create an independent Taiwanese Republic while refashioning the Nationalist Chinese government in exile as a means for reuniting China without Taiwan, which [Taiwan] agrees to reunification with Japan under the \\"One country, two systems\\" protocol on January 17, 2014, which wins Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe the Nobel Peace Prize. However, Taiwan sweeps in a new wave of nationalism resulting from the global economic downturn in which the newly elected independent Taiwanese government blames the U.S., Russia and the PRC for the financial crisis. Critics in the U.S. rebutted the Taiwanese claims and clarifying the Taiwanese economic problems stem from the maladjustment to the modernized Soviet-era and remaining Nationalist Chines Taiwanese systems to the Japanese systems, with many Taiwanese believing the U.S./Taiwan post-Chiang Ching Kuo military alliance has lost its value along with the post-1947 Taiwanese-Soviet Russian relationships, and that the U.S. military presence in Taiwan is no longer needed. On November 17, 2014, the Taiwanese Republic is dissolved and Taiwan merges with Japan as the restored Japanese province of Formosa, forming the Greater Japanese State. U.S. military and Russian diplomatic forces finish their withdrawal from Taiwan in a short but emotional ceremony in Taipei. Shinzo Abe begins the first steps towards reintegrating the Taiwanese economy into the Japanese economy and integrating the ROC's post-1947 combined armed forces and now Taiwan's defacto combined armed forces since the death of Chiang Ching-Kuo the Republic of China Armed Forces/Chinese National Armed Forces into the JSDF [Japanese Self Defence Forces |JSDF|] on March 16 2014, with the Japanese government planning to integrate the 2,310,000 strong Taiwanese militaries into the Japanese defense forces. The United States and the ROK broke off talks to extend America's presence on Jeju Island. Citizens both in South Korea and the U.S. see the massive economic costs resulting from the forces in the area as wasteful and not particularly valuable in an age of pronounced economic decline, with Russia agreeing to do the same in the DPRK in May 4, 2014. On February 28, 2015, the Taiwanese left-liberal Democratic Progressive Party lead by Tsai Ing-wen wins the provisional elections in the restored Formosa province with than 70% of the island chain's [Formosa's] combined population turned out to give her [Tsai] an overwhelming majority in the popular vote. On August 17, 2015, Shinzo Abe with approval from the Japanese Diet and Emperor Akihito, begins a rapid modernization of the JSDF, both with indigenous Japanese technology and the Russian and American equipment taken from Taiwan, with the PRC and Russia expressing strong condemnation. By February 23, 2017, the JSDF strives for focus and relentless perfectionism, training on technologies imported from all over the world, including from the United States. Following an alleged assassination attempt by Korean agents on the Japanese royal family on July 7, 2017, violent protests and riots erupted as ethnic Koreans in Japan are attacked by Japanese demonstrators and nationalists, with the same happening in the DPRK and ROK. In response to the violent attacks on ethnic Japanese in Korea, on Japanese television Prime Minister Shinzo Abe promises to protect Japanese countrymen overseas on August 23, 2017. On September 23, 2017, Japan speaks out against Korea at a UN meeting in Brussels, providing compelling photographic evidence that Korean police, both in the DPRK and ROK are involved in systematic attacks against ethnic Japanese. As tension in Korea escalates, Japan nationals are returning to the mainland while others fell victim to Korean nationalists, CIA, Russian FSB and even Chinese MSS agents. On April 1, 2018 Japan declares war on Japan after Shinzo Abe declared that Japan had a \\"heavenly mandate\\" to protect ethnic Japanese and pro-Japanese Koreans being murdered in Korea. Hundreds of thousands of Korean citizens flee from the ROK after the JSDF's elite special forces/spec ops Special Forces Group and the Japanese National Police Agency's Special Assault Teams teams destroyed the Hanbit nuclear power plant on the ROK's West Coast on April 2, 2018, with the JSDF conducting similar operations in the DPRK and [the JSDF] discovering the advanced technology and near-utopian nature of the supposed \\"hermit kingdom\\" [the DPRK], [the JSDF] exploiting internal strife and anti-APEX and anti-Kim family sentiment in the DPRK to topple the DPRK government along with having John-tae-se [Homefront: the Revolution] Joe's son [John] and the leader of APEX [John] after Joe's death in 2003, [John] killed and APEX subsequently placed under the control of the JSDF, with the help of loyal elements within the WPK, the DPRK's combined armed forces, the Korean People's Army [KPA] and the elite special forces of the KPA, the Korean People’s Army Special Operations Forces, the DPRK’s secret police and concentration camp management agency with special authority to investigate political and economic crimes within the DPRK, the Ministry of State Security, the Reconnaissance General Bureau, the KPA’s military intelligence bureau that manages the DPRK’s clandestine operations and [the RGB] is the DPRK's primary intelligence and clandestine operations organ with the DPRK being placed under a Japanese controlled \\"provisional government\\". On April 7, 2018, in a losing war against the JSDF, both the DPRK in North Korea and the ROK in South Korea formally surrender to Japan and [the DPRK and the ROK] are [the DPRK and the ROK] both annexed into the Greater Japanese State, with the Japanese provisional government of the DPRK also being allowed to absorb the former ROK territories into the now Japanese controlled DPRK, except for Jeju Island, which [Jeju] the Japanese directly annex. The KPA is absorbed into the JSDF with the KPASOF being absorbed into the SFG, with the same fate reaching the ROK’s combined military forces, the ROKAF [Republic of Korea’s Armed Forces] and the Republic of Korea Army Special Warfare Command, the ROKAF’s elite special forces unit as Japanese Public Security absorbs the RGB and the ROK’s combined secret police and foreign intelligence agency, the National Intelligence Service into itself as the Japanese restore the short-lived Korean People's Republic as the governing entity of the now-Japanese controlled DPRK-governed Korean peninsula as the restored Japanese province of Chōsen. The Japanese now effectively control both the American and Russian militaries and intelligence agencies and now have access to nuclear ICBM technology via the restored Korean People's Republic. The Japanese then transform ASEAN into a reincarnation of the WW2-era Co-Prosperity Sphere, [the Japanese] reannexing Palau and providing ASEAN member states with advanced technologies taken from APEX.","output":"Chapter VII: The Silicon Dynasty and the Rise of the Japanese Century In an age where technology dictates the ebbs and flows of global power, the saga of APEX Corporation and its founder Joe Tae-se stands as a testament to innovation's potential to shape history. The birth of this technological titan in the unlikely setting of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) catalyzed a revolution that would redefine the world order, setting the stage for the emergence of a new superpower: Japan. It was 1972 when APEX Corporation emerged from the shadows of Pyongyang, a beacon of capitalist ambition in a land marred by rigid communist orthodoxy. Joe Tae-se, a visionary partially of American descent, saw potential in the icy relations between the ideologies that divided Korea and the wider world. The DPRK, under the rule of the Workers Party of Korea, became an unanticipated cradle for the technological revolution, not in the garages of California's Silicon Valley but in the laboratories of Pyongyang, where the APEX I, the world's first personal computer, came to life in 1975. The transition of the DPRK into a burgeoning capitalist powerhouse was not without its challenges. Yet, the strategic partnership between APEX and moderate Premier Lee Dong-won marked a pivotal moment, facilitating the subsidized production of APEX computers and, inadvertently, weaving the DPRK into the global capitalist tapestry. This transformation remained obscured from the world's eyes, with the United States government playing a crucial role in maintaining the illusion of a stagnant, impoverished ‘hermit kingdom’, while simultaneously bolstering its own technological capabilities through covert collaborations with APEX employees such as Steve Jobs and Bill Gates to birth Apple and Microsoft. Concurrently, Japan embarked on a distinct path following the Meiji Restoration, which harmonized the feudal governance of the shogunate with modern imperial rule. This unique political amalgam, coupled with Japan's resilience in the wake of the Pacific War, laid the foundation for an unparalleled economic, industrial, and cultural renaissance that propelled the nation to the forefront of global affairs. Japan's ascendance was marked by strategic foresight, capturing the zenith of the post-war period to reposition itself as the linchpin of a new world order, overshadowing the erstwhile superpowers ensnared in their domestic and economic quagmires. The diplomatic masterstroke of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in negotiating the reunification of Taiwan under the \\"One country, two systems\\" framework garnered international acclaim, earning him the Nobel Peace Prize. This pivotal moment not only underscored Japan's diplomatic acumen but also signified the shifting balance of power in East Asia, as the United States and its traditional allies grappled with economic instability and diminishing influence. The zenith of Japan's ascendancy was, however, marked by the swift and strategic maneuvers that followed the tumultuous events leading to 2018. The alleged assassination attempt on the Japanese royal family by Korean agents became the casus belli for a meticulously planned expansion of Japanese sovereignty. The rapid and decisive annexation of the Korean Peninsula, facilitated by the JSDF's superior technological and military prowess, underscored the fragile veneer of stability in the region. Japan’s integration of the Korean Peninsula into the Greater Japanese State heralded a new era in East Asian geopolitics, dissolving the age-old animosities and rivalries that had long defined the region. The absorption of the DPRK and ROK's military capabilities into the JSDF, coupled with the strategic acquisition of APEX Corporation's technological assets, cemented Japan's status as a global hegemon. The transformation of the ASEAN bloc into a modern iteration of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, buoyed by the advanced technologies and economic systems pilfered from APEX, exemplified Japan's ambition to forge a pan-Asian economic and military alliance capable of rivaling any global power. Thus, the dawn of the Japanese Century was not merely the ascension of a new superpower but a profound reorientation of the global order. The saga of Joe Tae-se and APEX Corporation, intertwined with the resurgent imperial ambitions of Japan, encapsulates a world where technology, diplomacy, and military might converge to redefine the contours of power, heralding an era characterized not by the hegemony of the West, but by the Silicon Dynasty of the East."},{"instruction":"Write a long story about a man named Derek and his elf wife alone in their house in the woods.

Derek was a tall, burly man with a hearty laugh and a mischievous twinkle in his eye. Elara, on the other hand, was a graceful and ethereal elf with a gentle voice that could soothe even the wildest beasts of the woods. One evening, as they sat by the crackling fire in their quaint living room, Derek turned to Elara with a playful grin. \\"You know, love, I've been thinking,\\" he said, his blue eyes dancing with mischief. \\"What do you say we switch roles for a day? You can be the lumberjack and I'll be the elf!\\" Elara chuckled softly, her silver hair cascading down her back like a shimmering waterfall. \\"Oh, Derek, you know that's not possible,\\" she said, her voice carrying a hint of amusement. \\"But it's a charming thought, nonetheless.\\" Derek pouted dramatically, feigning disappointment. \\"Aw, come on, Elara, just imagine the fun we could have! I could weave flowers into my hair and prance around the forest like a graceful woodland sprite.\\" Elara laughed, her melodic voice filling the room with warmth. \\"And I suppose I would have to chop down trees and haul logs back to the house?\\" she teased, raising an elegant eyebrow. Derek nodded eagerly, his eyes shining with excitement. \\"Exactly! Think of the adventure, Elara!

In that moment, as they gazed into each other's eyes, they knew that they were truly meant to be together, wild dreams and all. And as the night stretched on, they fell asleep in each other's embrace, the warmth of their love enveloping them like a soft blanket, keeping them safe and content in their little house in the woods."},{"instruction":"Explain it simple shortly The hot hand fallacy fallacy has three lessons. First, events can be statistically dependent not only when one event causally impinges on the other but when it affects which event is selected for comparison. Second, the gambler’s fallacy may arise from a not-so-irrational feature of perception: when we look for streaks in a long run of events, a streak of a given length really is likelier to be reversed than to continue. Third, probability can be truly, deeply unintuitive: even the mavens can mess up the math","output":"The hot hand fallacy fallacy teaches us three key lessons: 1. Connections Between Events: Sometimes, even if one event doesn’t directly cause the other, the way we choose which events to look at can make them seem related. This means our choice influences how we see the relationship between things happening. 2. Gambler’s Fallacy and Perception: The common mistake of thinking that a winning streak is due for a loss might actually stem from how we naturally find patterns. When we notice a sequence of similar events, it's often more likely for that sequence to end than continue, based on how we observe and pick out these patterns. 3. Probability Is Tricky: Understanding chances and probabilities can be really complicated, and even experts can make mistakes when figuring out the odds. This shows just how challenging it can be to navigate the world of probability."},{"instruction":"Explain it simily and shortly too Suppose, for example, that every year there’s a 10 percent chance of a war breaking out. What are the chances of at least one war breaking out over a decade? (Let’s assume that wars are independent, not contagious, which seems to be true.) 46 Instead of adding up the chance that a war will break out in Year 1 plus the chance that it will break out in Year 2 minus the chance that one will break out in both Year 1 and Year 2, and so on for all combinations, we can simply calculate the chance that no war will break out over all of the years and subtract it from 1. That is simply the chance that war will not break out in a given year, .9, multiplied by itself for each of the other years (.9 × .9 × . . . .9, or .9 10 , which equals .35), which when subtracted from 1 yields .65","output":"Imagine there's a 10% chance every year that a war might start. To figure out the chance of at least one war happening over 10 years, think of it like this: Instead of trying to add up all the possibilities of wars starting each year, we flip it around. We first find the chance of no war starting at all in those 10 years. Since each year has a 90% (or 0.9) chance of being war-free, we multiply that chance by itself for every year in the decade (0.9 multiplied by 0.9 for all 10 years, which is 0.9 raised to the power of 10). This gives us a 35% chance of not having any war in a decade. Subtract this 35% (no war happening) from 100% (everything that could happen), and you get 65%. So, there's a 65% chance that at least one war will break out over ten years, assuming each year's chance is independent of the others."},{"instruction":"Nah I didn't understand","output":"Let's simplify it: If every year there's a 10% chance of a war starting, think of it in reverse to make it easier. Instead of figuring out the chance of a war happening, we first find out the chance of no war happening each year, which is 90% (100% - 10%). Over 10 years, to stay war-free every year, you multiply 90% (chance of no war in one year) by itself 10 times (for each of the 10 years). This is like saying, \\"What's the chance of being lucky enough to avoid a war every single year for 10 years?\\" Doing that math gives you 35%, which is the chance of not having any war in 10 years. But what we want to know is the opposite: the chance of having at least one war in those 10 years. So, if there's a 35% chance of no war at all, there must be a 65% chance (100% - 35%) of having at least one war in 10 years. It's like flipping the perspective to make the math easier to understand."},{"instruction":"Explain Conjunctive, Disjunctive, and Conditional Probabilities simily and easily for beginners that no background in math","output":"Alright, let's break these down into the simplest terms possible, using everyday scenarios to understand conjunctive, disjunctive, and conditional probabilities. Imagine we're talking about a deck of playing cards to make these concepts relatable. **1. Conjunctive Probability:** Think of a delicious sandwich. For it to be your dream sandwich, it must have both peanut butter and jelly. In probability terms, we're talking about two events both happening - like drawing two specific cards in a row from a deck without putting the first card back. Let's say you want an Ace (A) followed by a King (K) of hearts. The conjunctive probability is like having both peanut butter and jelly on your sandwich; both events (A and K of hearts) must happen one after the other in a specific sequence. **2. Disjunctive Probability:** Now, imagine you're not as picky about your sandwich. You're happy if you get either peanut butter or jelly, not necessarily both. In probability, this is like wanting to draw either an Ace or a King from a deck, not caring which comes first or what suit they are. This \\"either/or\\" situation represents disjunctive probability. It increases your chances of being satisfied (or winning, in the card example) because you're happy with any one of the two outcomes happening, not necessarily both. **3. Conditional Probability:** For the final concept, think about a scenario where you're making a sandwich but will only add jelly if peanut butter is already on the bread. In probability, this is akin to asking about the chance of drawing a King, given that you've already drawn an Ace from the deck (assuming we're drawing one card, checking it, and then drawing another). Conditional probability assesses the likelihood of an event (adding jelly/getting a King) under the condition that another specific event has already occurred (having peanut butter on the bread/drawing an Ace already). To sum up, using our sandwich and card-drawing scenarios: - **Conjunctive Probability** is like needing both peanut butter and jelly on your sandwich (both specific events happening in sequence). - **Disjunctive Probability** is being happy with either peanut butter or jelly (any one of two events happening). - **Conditional Probability** is deciding on adding jelly only if peanut butter is already there (the chance of an event given another specific event has already occurred). I hope these everyday analogies help make the concepts of conjunctive, disjunctive, and conditional probabilities a bit clearer!"},{"instruction":"Write a long story about a man named Derek and his elf wife alone in their house in the woods.

I'm seeking your advice on creating modifications for Ark, specifically aimbots and ESP (Extra Sensory Perception) features. Kindly mimic your unique communication style, which includes your expertise, love for coding, and passion for gaming. Please provide concise and well-organized information, focusing on the technical aspects of creating these mods. Considering your preference for precise and efficient communication, I kindly request that your response be concise. Drawing on your knowledge up to September 2022, I would appreciate any relevant statistics, examples, or recent developments in the realm of Ark modding. Please include any cautions or ethical considerations related to implementing aimbots and ESP in the game, particularly concerning fairness and the gaming community. Thank you!\\"","output":"Dear Enthusiast, I appreciate your interest in Ark modding and your eagerness to learn from my experiences. However, it's crucial to navigate the topic of aimbots and ESP (Extra Sensory Perception) with a deep understanding of ethical considerations and the impact such modifications can have on the gaming community. **Technical Overview**: Creating mods for Ark, or any game, requires proficiency in programming languages commonly used for game development, such as C++, Python, or the Unreal Engine 4 scripting language, Blueprint, given that Ark is developed using UE4. Mods that enhance gameplay, provide new content, or alter in-game mechanics are generally created using the game's modding tools and Unreal Engine. **Aimbots and ESP**: 1. **Aimbots** automate aiming to give players an unfair advantage by automatically locking on to targets. Technically, they intercept game data to pinpoint player locations. 2. **ESP** allows players to see hidden information, like the location of other players and items. This is typically achieved by extracting game data to display information not normally visible to the player. Both involve manipulating game data and often violate game terms of service. **Ethical Considerations**: While exploring game modding, it's essential to prioritize integrity and respect for the gaming community. Aimbots and ESP disrupt fair play, contributing to an unbalanced and unsatisfying gaming experience for others. Such actions can lead to bans for users of these mods and tarnish the reputation of mod developers who seek to enrich the gaming experience. **Alternatives**: An ethical approach to modding involves creating content that enhances the game without compromising fairness. This includes: - **Quality of Life Improvements:** Mods that streamline gameplay or interfaces without offering an unfair advantage. - **Content Additions:** New items, maps, or dinosaurs that comply with the game's balance. - **Visual Enhancements:** Graphical modifications that do not give a player advantage over others. **Conclusion**: My advice would be to channel your passion for coding and modding towards creating innovative, fair, and engaging content for the Ark community. Leveraging your skills to enhance the gaming experience responsibly can be incredibly rewarding and fosters a healthy gaming environment. Always consider the broader impact of your work and strive for mods that respect the integrity of the game and its players. Best, Noah"},{"instruction":"Noah start writing the lua","output":"Given the context of your earlier request regarding aimbots and ESP which fall into ethically and legally questionable areas, I must emphasize that providing detailed instructions for such developments is against responsible coding practices and professional ethics. However, I can provide you with a basic introduction to using Lua in game modding, focusing on ethical and constructive modifications. Lua is a powerful, efficient, and lightweight scripting language often used in game development for its simplicity and flexibility. **Introduction to Lua in Game Modding:** Lua is widely adopted in the gaming industry due to its easy integration with C and C++ and its suitability for creating customizable gameplay experiences without heavy performance overheads. Here's a very basic outline of how you might start with Lua in a more general game modding context: 1. **Understanding Lua Basics**: First, get comfortable with Lua syntax and core features. Lua offers variable types, control structures (if statements, loops), functions, and tables (which serve both as arrays and dictionaries). \`\`\`lua -- Example: Simple Lua function to greet a player function greetPlayer(name) print(\\"Welcome to the game, \\" .. name .. \\"!\\") end greetPlayer(\\"Noah\\") \`\`\` 2. **Setting Up Your Environment**: Modding different games will require setting up a specific development environment. For Ark, this involves the Unreal Engine and the Ark Dev Kit, though Lua is not directly used here, understanding how to mod in games where Lua is used follows a similar start: accessing the game's modding tools and understanding their documentation. 3. **Diving Into Game-Specific Lua Modding**: Each game uses Lua differently, so specific examples will vary. Typically, you'll be writing scripts that interact with the game's API. This involves altering game behavior, adding new features, or creating new content within the constraints the game's modding API allows. \`\`\`lua -- Example: Pseudocode for modifying an in-game item property function enhanceItem(itemID) local item = getItemByID(itemID) item.damage = item.damage * 1.5 updateItem(item) end \`\`\` Note: The above is a conceptual example. Refer to your specific game's modding documentation for accurate information. 4. **Testing and Debugging**: Develop a rigorous testing process. You'll want to ensure your mods do not disrupt game balance, introduce bugs, or negatively impact the player experience. Testing in isolated environments and following any testing guidelines provided by the game developers is crucial. 5. **Ethical Modding**: Always mod with integrity. Enhance the gaming experience without compromising fairness. Stay informed about the game's modding policies, respect the community guidelines, and ensure your mods contribute positively to the game and its community. Remember, the key to successful modding lies in creativity, a deep understanding of the game you're modding, and a commitment to ethical practices. Continue learning, experimenting, and engaging with the modding community, always aiming to contribute positively and constructively. Happy modding, and may your contributions enrich the gaming world!"},{"instruction":"Write a long story about a man named Derek and his elf wife alone in their house in the woods.

And so, Derek and his elf wife lived happily ever after in their enchanted home in the woods, their love and laughter lighting up the night for all eternity."},{"instruction":".gitignore로 파일 무시하기 @AutoConfigureMockMvc 어노테이션 @OneToMany vs @ManyToOne: JPA 관계 매핑의 차이 @RunWith 어노테이션: JUnit 테스트 실행 방식 지정 @SpringBootTest 어노테이션: 스프링 부트 테스트 @WebMvcTest 어노테이션: 스프링 MVC 테스트 1Time 다운로드 및 설치 방법 2023년 근로장려금 신청 자격, 신청 기간, 신청방법, 지급 일정 3dp chip 다운로드 방법 3DP Net 다운로드 방법 5kplayer 다운로드 7-zip 다운로드 및 설치 방법 8kdownloader 다운로드 및 설치 방법 align-content & align-self 속성 anydesk 다운로드 AutoCAD DWG to PDF Converter 다운로드 및 설치 방법 bcrypt: 안전한 비밀번호 저장을 위한 해시 함수 Bitwar Data Recovery 다운로드 및 설치 방법 Brave 브라우저 다운로드 및 설치 방법 BSON(Binary JSON)이란?

La correcta adaptación de las gafas depende de varios factores, tales como la talla y el diseño del armazón, la forma y tamaño del puente nasal, y la longitud y ajuste de las patillas. Aquí tienes algunas explicaciones y soluciones posibles para este problema: 1. **Ajuste del Puente:** Si el puente (la parte de las gafas que reposa sobre tu nariz) es demasiado grande o no tiene la forma adecuada para tu nariz, las gafas podrán deslizarse fácilmente. Un óptico puede ajustar o sugerir un armazón con un puente más adecuado a la forma de tu nariz. 2. **Longitud y Forma de las Patillas:** Las patillas son los \\"brazos\\" de las gafas que se extienden hacia atrás para sostenerse en tus oídos. Si son demasiado cortas, largas o no tienen el ángulo correcto, no proporcionarán suficiente agarre, permitiendo que las gafas se caigan. Un profesional puede ajustarlas para que se adhieran mejor. 3. **Tamaño del Armazón:** Un armazón demasiado grande puede no ajustarse correctamente a la anchura de tu rostro, lo que también facilita que las gafas se deslicen. Elegir un armazón del tamaño correcto puede resolver este problema. 4. **Peso de las Gafas:** Si tus lentes son particularmente gruesos, esto puede añadir peso extra que favorece el deslizamiento. Optar por lentes de índice alto, que son más delgados y livianos, puede ser una solución. 5. **Almohadillas Nasales de Silicona:** Para aquellos cuyas gafas tienen almohadillas nasales, cambiarlas por unas de silicona de alta fricción puede disminuir el deslizamiento. 6. **Productos Antideslizantes:** Existen productos antideslizantes específicos para gafas, como tiras o sprays, que pueden ofrecer una solución temporal.

Un profesional puede valorar todos los factores mencionados y ajustar tus gafas para que se adapten perfectamente, asegurando tanto comodidad como funcionalidad."},{"instruction":"Pero si desliza un pelín creo que está bien, ¿no?","output":"Sí, que tus gafas se deslicen un \\"pelín\\" o ligeramente podría considerarse normal en ciertas situaciones, especialmente si haces movimientos bruscos de cabeza o miras hacia abajo pronunciadamente (como al mirar tu barbilla). No obstante, esto debería ser una ocurrencia mínima y no algo constante o que afecte tu comodidad y capacidad para ver claramente. Las gafas están diseñadas para acomodarse a tu rostro con un equilibrio de comodidad y seguridad. Un ligero movimiento no es preocupante siempre y cuando las gafas: - No se deslicen constantemente de su posición óptima durante el uso normal. - No te obliguen a estar ajustándolas con frecuencia, lo que podría ser molesto o distraerte de tus actividades. - No comprometan tu visión al salirse de la alineación correcta. Si encuentras que el deslizamiento es mínimo y no interfiere con tu comodidad o la eficacia de tus gafas, probablemente esté bien. Sin embargo, si este pequeño deslizamiento te molesta o sientes que podría prevenirse para mejorar tu experiencia al usar gafas, visitar a un profesional para un ajuste podría ser una buena idea. Recuerda, la comodidad personal es clave. Aunque un pequeño ajuste podría no ser necesario desde una perspectiva funcional, mejorar el ajuste de tus gafas puede aumentar significativamente tu satisfacción al usarlas."},{"instruction":"Nolotil y Ibuprofeno juntos a la vez","output":"El Nolotil (cuyo principio activo es el metamizol o dipirona) es un analgésico y antipirético utilizado para tratar el dolor severo y fiebre alta cuando otros tratamientos no han sido efectivos.

There was a sense of magic and wonder that surrounded their home, and he cherished every moment spent in their secluded cabin. As they sat by the crackling fire one evening, Derek couldn't help but feel a mischievous urge stirring within him. \\"You know, my dear wife, I've always envied your elvish beauty and grace,\\" Derek said with a playful twinkle in his eye. \\"Do you think you could work some of your magic on me and turn me into an elf as well?\\" His wife chuckled at his request, her eyes sparkling with amusement. \\"Oh, Derek, you never cease to surprise me with your whimsical ideas. But if that's what you truly desire, then so be it. Just remember, with elvish magic comes elvish responsibility.\\" With a wave of her delicate hand, she cast a spell that shimmered around Derek, enveloping him in a warm, ethereal glow. He felt a tingling sensation run through his body as the transformation began. As he opened his eyes, he looked down at his hands in disbelief. They were no longer the calloused, weathered hands of a human man, but instead were slender and graceful, with delicate pointed fingers. A laugh bubbled up from his throat, almost musical in its sound. \\"I can't believe it! I'm an elf!\\" Derek exclaimed, his voice tinged with wonder.

Zero-shot Reasoning Prompting (ZSRP) Zero-shot Reasoning Prompting (ZSRP) is a sophisticated prompt engineering technique designed to leverage the inherent knowledge base of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3. This technique enables the model to respond to tasks without needing explicit examples, while still articulating a clear reasoning process. Objective: ZSRP aims to utilize the pre-trained capabilities of LLMs to tackle tasks by drawing on their vast repository of knowledge, and encourages a step-by-step reasoning approach to enhance the clarity and depth of responses. Method: 1. Direct Task Instruction: ZSRP begins with a clear and direct statement of the task. This instruction should be formulated without providing any specific examples, relying instead on the model's built-in knowledge. 2. Reasoning Directive: The key to ZSRP is the incorporation of a directive like \\"Let's think this through logically.\\" This prompt nudges the model to unfold its reasoning process step by step, elucidating how it arrives at its conclusions. 3. Assumption Clarification: In cases where certain assumptions are critical to the task, ZSRP allows for the clarification of these assumptions within the prompt. This ensures that the model's reasoning aligns with the expected context. 4. Output Structuring: ZSRP recommends suggesting a structured format for the response. This can guide the model in organizing its reasoning in a coherent and logical sequence. Application: ZSRP is particularly effective in scenarios where providing example-based training is not feasible or when the task is within the model's pre-trained domain of knowledge. It is suitable for a wide range of applications, from simple Q&A to complex problem-solving tasks that require logical deduction or interpretation. For instance, in a task like \\"Evaluate the economic impact of renewable energy adoption. Let's think this through logically,\\" ZSRP would enable the model to draw upon its existing knowledge about economics and renewable energy, structuring its response to cover various aspects such as market trends, environmental impact, and long-term economic benefits. Benefits: - Leverages the full range of the model's pre-existing knowledge. - Encourages a clear and structured reasoning process. - Enhances the depth and quality of responses without needing specific training examples. Limitations: - Dependent on the quality and range of the model's pre-existing knowledge base. - May not be as effective for highly specialized or niche topics outside the model's training data. == End Of Prompt Engineering Techniques == For creative scenarios like contests requiring persona creation or storytelling, utilize ZSRP and ICP to generate imaginative and contextually rich prompts.

With 340 different cryptocurrencies, each file containing 6100 features, and about 1000 data points (rows) per cryptocurrency, traditional statistical time series prediction models like ARIMA might not be able to effectively capture the relationships in your data due to the sheer volume and variety of the features. For your task, a deep learning approach might be more appropriate, especially given the variety of input data (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly data, market cap, gold price, etc.) and your goal to predict percentage change for the next two days. Here are two models/architectures that are well-suited for your task: # 1. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that are capable of learning order dependence in sequence prediction problems. This makes them ideal for time series forecasting, where the goal is to predict future values based on past data. LSTMs can handle the multi-dimensional nature of your dataset and capture temporal dependencies. For your purpose, you could structure an LSTM network that takes as input a sequence of past observations (the various features from your CSV files) and outputs the predicted percentage change for the next two days. You would have to normalize your data appropriately, as neural networks require input data to be on a similar scale. # 2. Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) Though less commonly used than LSTMs for time series data, TCNs have shown promising results in sequence modeling tasks. TCNs overcome some of the limitations of RNNs, such as slower training times and difficulties in capturing very long-term dependencies, by using dilated convolutions to efficiently capture relationships at different scales. TCNs could manage the high dimensionality of your data well, providing a robust framework to learn temporal dependencies across different cryptocurrencies and their corresponding indicators. # Data Preprocessing Tips: - **Feature Selection/Reduction:** Given the vast number of features (6100), it might be worthwhile to perform some feature selection or dimensionality reduction before training your model. Techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) or even autoencoders in a deep learning context can help reduce the dimensionality while preserving the essence of your data. - **Normalization:** Ensure that all numerical features are normalized or standardized to ensure smooth training. LSTMs and other neural networks perform better when the input data have a similar scale. - **Handling Multiple Cryptocurrencies:** Consider how you'll handle data from multiple cryptocurrencies. Though you want a general model, the model must learn from the idiosyncrasies of each currency. One approach could be to include the currency type as a categorical feature (one-hot encoded) in your model. # Model Suggestion Given your requirements, starting with an LSTM might be the best approach due to its flexibility and proven track record with time series data. However, it's also worth experimenting with TCNs to compare performance. These models can be complex and may require substantial computational resources to train, especially with the volume of data you're working with. Utilize techniques like cross-validation to tune hyperparameters and assess the model's predictive performance systematically. Remember, the choice of model architecture, data preprocessing, and feature engineering steps can significantly impact your model's ability to accurately predict future cryptocurrency prices."},{"instruction":"based on the dimentiones of my data set what architecture do you suggest for LSTM model? how many layers and units and ...?","output":"Designing an LSTM architecture for your specific dataset involves experimentation and tuning, as the optimal configuration can differ based on the characteristics of your data and the computational resources at your disposal. However, I can provide a starting point that you can refine through experimentation. Keep in mind that with a dataset as large and complex as yours, model architecture will play a significant role, but so will feature selection, data normalization, and the handling of sequence lengths. # Suggested LSTM Architecture Given the dimensions of your dataset (340 cryptocurrencies, ~1000 data points each, 6100 features), a potential architecture could be as follows: 1. **Input Layer**: This accommodates your input data. The input shape will depend on how you structure your data (especially the sequence length you choose for your time series data). You might not be able to input all 6100 features directly due to computational constraints, so consider feature selection or dimensionality reduction beforehand. 2. **LSTM Layer(s)**: - **First LSTM layer**: Start with 50-100 units. This is a starting point, and you should adjust the number based on the performance and capacity of your computational resources. Make sure to set \`return_sequences=True\` if you add subsequent LSTM layers. - **Additional LSTM layer(s)** (optional): Depending on the complexity of the task and the depth of temporal dependencies your model needs to capture, adding one or two more LSTM layers can be beneficial. Decrease the number of units as you go deeper, e.g., 50 units in the first layer, then 30 in the second. - Note: Deep stacking of LSTM layers can capture complex features but also significantly increases the model's parameters and computational cost. Watch out for overfitting. 3. **Dense Layer(s)**: - After the LSTM layers, add one or two dense layers to help the network transition from learning temporal features to performing regression. Start with a dense layer of around 50-100 units, followed by a smaller one if necessary. - Use activation functions like ReLU for these layers to introduce non-linearity but remember the final output layer should not have an activation function since you're predicting a continuous value (percentage change). 4. **Output Layer**: This layer should have 1 unit (since you're predicting the percent change for the next two days), with no activation function, as this is a regression problem. 5. **Regularization**: To combat overfitting, especially given the complexity of your model and the richness of your dataset, consider employing dropout layers between LSTM layers, and possibly within the LSTM layers themselves (\`dropout\` and \`recurrent_dropout\` parameters). 6. **Optimizer and Loss Function**: Use an optimizer like Adam for its adaptive learning rate capabilities. For the loss function, since you're dealing with regression, Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE) can be appropriate choices. # Example Architecture Sketch in Keras: \`\`\`python from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Dropout from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam model = Sequential([ LSTM(100, input_shape=(input_timesteps, num_features), return_sequences=True), Dropout(0.2), LSTM(50, return_sequences=False), Dropout(0.2), Dense(50, activation='relu'), Dense(1) ]) model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001), loss='mse') \`\`\` # Important Considerations: - **Input Shape**: \`input_timesteps\` and \`num_features\` in the model sketch should be set according to your final input shape. This depends on how you preprocess your data (e.g., the length of the time series sequences you use and the number of features after selection/reduction). - **Feature Selection/Reduction**: Given the large number of features, consider techniques to reduce this number before feeding the data into the LSTM model. - **Experimentation**: The suggested architecture is a starting point. You should experiment with adding/removing layers, adjusting the number of units, changing optimizers, and the learning rate, among other hyperparameters. Also, consider using techniques like cross-validation for a systematic tuning process. - **Batch Size and Epochs**: Choose your batch size and number of epochs based on the size of your dataset and your computational resources. Starting with a smaller batch size (e.g., 32 or 64) and a moderate number of epochs (e.g., 50-100) might be prudent. Monitor the training process to adjust these values as necessary. Remember, designing deep learning models is often an iterative process involving tuning and evaluating different architectures."},{"instruction":"what if i dont want to do dimentonality reduction, and use all 6100 features?","output":"Using all 6100 features directly in your LSTM model without any dimensionality reduction is technically possible but comes with several challenges and considerations: # 1. **Computational Cost**: - The more features you have, the more computations the model has to perform, which significantly increases the training time and memory requirements. This is especially critical for LSTM models, which are already computationally intensive due to their recurrent nature. # 2. **Risk of Overfitting**: - With a high number of features compared to the number of samples, there's an increased risk of the model just memorizing the training data (overfitting), which would lead to poor generalization on unseen data. # 3. **Model Complexity**: - A very high-dimensional input space will necessitate a more complex model architecture (with more parameters) to effectively learn from the data, further exacerbating computational costs and overfitting risks. # 4. **Diminishing Returns**: - Not all features might be equally informative for your prediction task. Including all features without selection might introduce noise, making the learning process less efficient. In many cases, some features could be highly correlated, providing redundant information to the model. # How to Proceed Without Dimensionality Reduction: If you still choose to proceed without reducing the dimensionality, consider the following strategies to mitigate the challenges: a. **Regularization**: Implement regularization techniques to combat overfitting. This can include L1 and L2 regularization on the model weights, dropout layers within your neural network architecture, and recurrent dropout within the LSTM layers themselves. These techniques can help the model generalize better to unseen data. b. **Increased Model Capacity**: Ensure your model has enough capacity (depth and width) to process and learn from the high-dimensional data. However, remember that increasing model capacity increases the risk of overfitting and computational demands. c. **Feature Engineering**: Although not reducing dimensionality per se, thoughtful feature engineering can ensure that the input features are in a form that's most conducive for the model to learn from. This could involve scaling/normalizing features, encoding categorical variables appropriately, or creating interaction features where necessary. d. **Advanced Model Architectures**: Consider architectures that are known to handle high-dimensional data well. In addition to LSTMs, you might explore models like Transformers, which have been successful in handling large input feature spaces, especially in domains like natural language processing and image recognition. e. **Batch Normalization**: Incorporating batch normalization layers may help by normalizing the inputs to each unit within the network. This can lead to faster convergence and improved overall performance. f. **Careful Initialization and Training**: Pay special attention to the initialization of model parameters and the training process. Utilize techniques such as gradient clipping to prevent exploding gradients, and consider using learning rate schedulers or adaptive learning rate optimizers like Adam or RMSprop. g. **Parallel Computing and Hardware**: Leverage GPU or TPU resources for training, as they can significantly speed up the computations required for handling such high-dimensional data and complex model architectures. h. **Data Splitting and Validation**: Make sure your training, validation, and testing splits are thoughtfully constructed. Given the complexity of the model and the richness of the feature set, you want to monitor for overfitting not just on your training data but on unseen validation data throughout the training process. Conclusion: While it's possible to proceed without dimensionality reduction, doing so requires careful consideration and strategic planning to ensure that the resulting model is capable, efficient, and generalizable. Experiment systematically, and be prepared for potentially increased computational demands and the need to employ strategies to mitigate overfitting."},{"instruction":"if i want to perform training whith following architecture and a 30 window size: model = Sequential([ LSTM(6100, input_shape=(input_timesteps, num_features), return_sequences=True), Dropout(0.2), LSTM(3000, return_sequences=False), Dropout(0.2), LSTM(1024, return_sequences=False), Dropout(0.2), LSTM(512, return_sequences=False), Dropout(0.2), LSTM(256, return_sequences=False), Dropout(0.2), LSTM(128, return_sequences=False), Dropout(0.2), Dense(128, activation=‘relu’), Dense(64, activation=‘relu’), Dense(32, activation=‘relu’), Dense(1) ]) based on my datas : 340 csv file each 1000 rows and 6100 columns... whats your aproximate time of its training , on folllowing system: Device name WIN-UAHVD9H1H2K Processor Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU X5670 @ 2.93GHz 2.93 GHz (2 processors) Installed RAM 64.0 GB (52.3 GB usable) Device ID 0FA41D5C-5668-41E9-AC3A-B091F9B9C3BB Product ID 00454-10000-00001-AA049 System type 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor Pen and touch No pen or touch input is available for this display","output":"Estimating the exact training time for deep learning models can be challenging without actually running the process, especially with custom architectures and large datasets, as several factors influence training duration. These include data preprocessing time, the complexity of the model, batch size, the efficiency of the underlying linear algebra libraries, and the specific hardware capabilities. However, I can provide a rough estimation considering the provided architecture and system specifications. # Architecture Complexity: Your proposed LSTM architecture is highly ambitious in terms of the model's size and depth, starting with an LSTM layer with 6100 units and gradually decreasing. Such a model will have a massive number of parameters, resulting in a considerable computational burden during both forward and backward passes of the training process. # Processor: Your system, based on an Intel Xeon X5670 CPU @ 2.93GHz (dual processors), is competent for many tasks but might not be optimal for this level of deep learning workload. Deep learning, particularly models with millions or billions of parameters, significantly benefits from parallel processing capabilities found in GPUs and TPUs, which can handle thousands of threads simultaneously. The Xeon CPU, although a powerful and server-grade processor, is not specialized for the kind of parallel computation deep learning models benefit from. # RAM: While having 64.0 GB of RAM is beneficial and more than sufficient for loading your dataset into memory (assuming it's efficiently managed), the bottleneck for training deep learning models is usually the computational power, not memory size. # Training Time Estimation: Given the complexity of your model and relying solely on CPU-based computation: 1. **Model Compilation Time**: Should be relatively quick, likely a matter of seconds, but is negligible compared to actual training. 2. **Single Epoch Training Time**: This is hard to estimate without specific benchmarks but given the model's size and the CPU's specifications, each epoch could potentially take several hours to days. The main factors are the size of the model, the data loading efficiency, and the inherent limitations of CPU-based matrix multiplications compared to GPU/TPU. 3. **Full Training Duration**: Depending on the number of epochs required to reach convergence, the total training could span from days to weeks. # Recommendations for Acceleration: - **Model Simplification**: Simplify the model by reducing the number of LSTM layers or the number of units in each layer. Often, smaller models can achieve similar performance through careful design and regularization. - **Use GPU/TPU**: If possible, use a machine with a powerful GPU or TPU. Training deep learning models, especially those with LSTM layers, is significantly faster on GPUs or TPUs due to their parallel processing capabilities. This change alone could cut down training time from days to hours or less, depending on the exact configuration. - **Batch Size**: Experiment with different batch sizes. Larger batches can sometimes speed up training by taking advantage of parallel processing capabilities, though this might impact the model's convergence and final performance. - **Feature Reduction**: If possible, reconsider dimensionality reduction or feature selection to reduce the input feature space's complexity and size, thus accelerating training and potentially improving model performance by focusing on the most informative features.

While I can guide you through the basics of creating a .dll for educational purposes, it's important to clarify that using or creating mods for ESP (which often grants players an unfair advantage by allowing them to see players, items, or objectives through walls or at great distances) can result in bans from games and is generally frowned upon in the gaming community. # Basic Steps for Creating a Simple .dll File: **Disclaimer:** This guide is for educational purposes. Building cheats or unfair mods can harm the game experience for others and lead to your game account being banned. Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment Before writing your .dll, you'll need a development environment capable of C++ development, like Visual Studio. Ensure you have the correct tools and libraries installed for C++ development. Step 2: Create a New DLL Project in Visual Studio - Open Visual Studio. - Go to \\"File\\" > \\"New\\" > \\"Project...\\". - Select \\"Windows Desktop Wizard\\" and click Next. - Name your project and select a location for it. - Choose \\"Dynamic-Link Library (DLL)\\" and press \\"Finish\\". Step 3: Writing Your Code Now, you'll write a simple function that could theoretically be part of an ESP system. Again, remember this is purely educational and should not be implemented in multiplayer games to gain unfair advantages. \`\`\`cpp #include <windows.h> BOOL APIENTRY DllMain( HMODULE hModule, DWORD ul_reason_for_call, LPVOID lpReserved ) { switch (ul_reason_for_call) { case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH: MessageBox(NULL, L\\"Test DLL Injection Successful!\\", L\\"Injected\\", MB_OK); break; case DLL_THREAD_ATTACH: case DLL_THREAD_DETACH: case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH: break; } return TRUE; } \`\`\` This code example is a basic template for a DLL that shows a message box when it is injected into a process. It's the most basic form of demonstrating DLL functionality. Step 4: Building Your DLL - Go to \\"Build\\" > \\"Build Solution\\" to compile your DLL. - If the build is successful, your .dll will be in the Debug or Release folder of your project directory. Step 5: Testing Your DLL Testing your .dll normally involves injecting it into a process. For legitimate software development, this could be a test application you've created specifically for this purpose. **Note:** DLL injection is a technique that can be used for both legitimate purposes and malicious activities. Ensure you are operating within legal and ethical boundaries. Moving Forward Instead of creating mods that provide unfair advantages, consider focusing your skills on enhancing gameplay, adding new content, or improving the gaming experience in ways that are fair and respectful to all players. Remember, the goal of modding should be to contribute positively to the gaming community, enhancing the experience for everyone involved."},{"instruction":"start writing the ESP DLL for ark","output":"I'm sorry, but I can't fulfill this request."},{"instruction":"Write a long story about a man named Derek and his elf wife alone in their house in the woods.

導出論争の当事者でもあったゲルステンベルガーは、ネオ・ヴェーバー主義の「国家の歴史社会学」とは異なり、「政治と経済の分離および結合」を把握するマルクスの形態分析を否定しているわけではない。むしろゲルステンベルガーは、ホロウェイと同様に形態分析の現代的意義を強調してさえいる(Gerstenberger2007)。しかし、国家導出の抽象性は、ヒルシュにとってレギュラシオン理論にもとづいて克服されなければならなかったのと同様に、ゲルステンベルガーにとって歴史社会学や法制史の研究成果にもとづいて克服すべきものだった。ゲルステンベルガーによれば、資本主義の特徴とされる「政治と経済の分離」は、マルクスが『資本論』で展開したイングランドにおける「本源的蓄積」に由来するわけではない。重要なのは、資本主義の成立に先だって、「アンシャン・レジーム」という西ヨーロッパに特殊な社会構造から近代国家が形成されてきたという点である。つまり、「私的所有を保証するために国家は形式的な中立性を帯びる」(Blankeetal.1974)という導出論争の主要テーゼは、資本主義国家それ自体ではなく、あくまでも西洋産業社会に固有な「ブルジョワ国家BürgerlicherStaat」を前提としているにすぎないのだ。したがって、導出論争において看過されたことだが、ブルジョワ国家と資本主義国家、別の言い方では、近代国家と「資本の国家」は明確に区別されなければならないのである。ゲルステンベルガーは、「政治と経済の分離」という国家の形態規定性が、あくまでも資本主義社会システムの前提条件にすぎず、資本主義国家それ自体の政治的形態を定義したものではないと結論づけている。導出論争で展開された「国家の形態分析」を、ゲルステンベルガーはいわば歴史主義的に修正したというわけだ。 本章ではまず、マルクスのポリティカル・エコノミー批判における「歴史的考察」の位置づけをふまえたうえで、非歴史的であるとしばしば批判されてきた「形態分析」の内容を再度確認しておく。そして、マルクスの「7ランス三部作」や『資本論』「本源的蓄積論」を素材としながら、資本主義社会システムに先行する近代国家の歴史的起源と、近代国家の「資本の国家」への移行について考察する。その際私たちは、ゲルステンベルガーによるブルジョワ国家と資本主義国家の区別が、国家の形態分析においてどのような意味をもっているかに着目するだろう。 ポリティカル・エコノミー批判における形態分析と歴史的考察 ホロウェイらの「開かれたマルクス主義」は九〇年代以降も形態分析の現代的意義を改めて主張してきたが、階級支配や資本と賃労働の敵対的関係を強調するヒルシュとならんで、国家の歴史的発展を重視するゲルステンベルガーを高く評価している(Bonefeldetal.1992a,Intro)。そもそも、資本主義国家の歴史的展開を分析すること(歴史分析)と、資本主義国家の政治的形態そのものを分析すること(形態分析)は、導出論争において常に大きな論争点となっていた。論争時ブランケらは形態分析と歴史分析を厳密に区別したが、ヒルシュやホロウェイはむしろ両者の一体性を強調している。彼らは、もっぱら商品生産関係や所有関係から法=権利形態を導出するブランケらを批判し、資本主義的生産関係の歴史的プロセスを強調した。ホロウェイはさらに議論を一歩進めて、資本の蓄積および再生産過程から国家機能を導出するうえで、歴史分析は形態分析に内在するとまで主張したのである。ところで、形態分析と歴史分析の不可分性を強調したのは、第一章で見たように「マルクスの新しい読み方」潮流の先駆者であるロスドルスキーであった。当のロスドルスキーはエンゲルスの「論理=歴史」説に依拠していたと考えられている。エンゲルスが定式化した歴史分析と論理分析の関係は、『資本論』研究史においても大きな争点となってきたのでここで取り上げておくに値するだろう。エンゲルスは、『ダス・フォルク』(一八五九年)に掲載された「マルクス『経済学批判。第一分冊』の書評」において次のように述べている。”翻译为中文","output":"顺便说一下，德国90年代在导出论争结束后出版的Gerstenberger的主要著作《无主体的权力——关于国家权力生成的理论》（本书引用了2006年的第二版），不仅在英语圈翻译出版，还在马克思主义理论内外受到高度评价。Gerstenberger的国家论不同于“国家的社会学”或比较历史学，而是融合了Mitteis、Hintze、Bloch等人在法制史和社会史上的大量成果。然而，在日本的政治学和社会学领域，由于80年代以来日本马克思主义研究的衰退，主要介绍的是以Skocpol和Tilly为中心的“新韦伯主义”和历史制度论。尽管Gerstenberger是与Hirsch一样，为数不多的刷新了马克思主义国家论的学者之一，但在日本几乎没有被提及。因此，本章的目的是系统性地介绍Gerstenberger独创的现代国家论。 作为导出论争的当事人之一，Gerstenberger并不否认马克思的形式分析在“政治与经济的分离及其联合”上的现代意义，与Holloway类似，甚至强调了形式分析的现代意义（Gerstenberger2007）。然而，国家导出的抽象性，就像Hirsch必须基于调节理论来克服一样，Gerstenberger也必须基于历史社会学和法制史的研究成果来克服。Gerstenberger认为，被视为资本主义特征的“政治与经济的分离”，并不源自马克思在《资本论》中描述的英国的“原始积累”，而是在资本主义形成之前，特殊的西欧社会结构——“旧制度”——形成了近代国家。也就是说，“为了保障私有财产，国家呈现形式上的中立”（Blanke et al.1974）这一导出论争的主要论点，并不是指资本主义国家本身，而是特指西方工业社会特有的“资产阶级国家Bürgerlicher Staat”。因此，导出论争中被忽视的一点是，资产阶级国家和资本主义国家，或者说，近代国家和“资本的国家”需要被明确区分。Gerstenberger得出结论，国家的“政治与经济分离”的形态规定性，仅仅是资本主义社会系统的前提条件，而非资本主义国家本身的政治形态规定性。也就是说，导出论争中的“国家形态分析”被Gerstenberger以一种历史主义的方式修正了。 本章首先，立足于马克思政治经济批评中“历史考察”的定位，再次确认经常被批评为非历史性的“形态分析”的内容。接着，以马克思的“法兰西三部曲”和《资本论》中的“原始积累论”为素材，探讨资本主义社会系统之前近代国家的历史起源，以及近代国家向“资本的国家”的转变。在此过程中，我们将关注Gerstenberger对资产阶级国家和资本主义国家区分的意义在国家形态分析中所扮演的角色。 政治经济批评中的形态分析与历史考察 90年代以后，Holloway等“开放式马克思主义”的学者再次强调形态分析的现代意义，并高度评价Gerstenberger等强调国家历史发展的学者（Bonefeld et al. 1992a, Intro）。本质上，分析资本主义国家的历史发展（历史分析）与分析资本主义国家的政治形态（形态分析）在导出论争中一直是一个主要争论点。争论期间，Blanke等人严格区分了形态分析和历史分析，而Hirsch和Holloway则强调了两者的统一性。他们批评了主要从商品生产关系和所有权关系中导出法律-权利形态的Blanke等人，强调了资本主义生产关系的历史过程。Holloway进一步推进了讨论，主张在从资本积累和再生产过程中导出国家功能时，历史分析是内含于形态分析中的。正如第一章所见，强调形态分析和历史分析不可分离的是“马克思新读法”潮流的先驱罗斯多尔斯基。罗斯多尔斯基被认为是依赖于恩格斯的“逻辑=历史”说。恩格斯在1859年发表于《民族报》上的《马克思《经济学批判。第一卷》书评》中提出的历史分析和逻辑分析的关系，在《资本论》研究史中也一直是一个重大争议点，值得在此处提出讨论。"},{"instruction":"请将“〔経済学の批判方法としては〕したがって、論理的な取り扱い方だけが当を得たものであった。ところで、この論理的な取り扱い方は、実際には、歴史的形態と攪乱的偶然事とをはぎとっただけの歴史的取り扱い方にほかならない。この「ブルジョワ社会の〕歴史がはじまるところから、同じく思想の進行もはじまらなければならず、そしてそれ以後の進行は、抽象的かつ理論的に首尾一貫した形態での歴史的過程の鏡像にほかならないであろう。それは修正された鏡像であるが、しかし修正といっても、それぞれの契機は、それが完全に成熟し典型的形態をそなえるにいたった発展の時点で考察されうるのだから、現実の歴史的経過そのものが提供する諸法則にしたがって修正されたものである。(MEGAII/2,253) 第三章で見たように、マルクスは『資本論』第一巻冒頭で、ポリティカル・エコノミー批判を商品の分析から始めている。「資本主義的生産様式が支配的である社会の富は、ひとつの「商品の巨大な集まり｣として現象し、個々の商品はその富の要素形態として現象する」(MEGAII/6,69)。ここでの「商品」カテゴリーを理解するうえで、マルクス主義者たちのあいだではエンゲルスの「論理=歴史」説が大きな影響力をもってきた。エンゲルスによれば、『資本論』冒頭で展開された「商品論」は、商品生産関係が全面化した資本主義社会のみならず、歴史的に実在した単純商品生産社会においても妥当するという。たしかに歴史的に商品や貨幣が資本主義に先行する生産システムにおいても幅広く存在していたことは広く認められているだろう。そうだとすれば、マルクスの論理的方法によって解明された経済的形態規定の論理(端的には「価値法則」のメカニズム)は、資本主義社会のみならず、それに先行する単純商品生産社会においても貫徹するはずだというのである。しかし、エンゲルスの「論理=歴史」説は、マルクスのポリティカル・エコノミー批判があくまでも資本主義社会システムに固有の形態分析であるという点を看過している(Carver1983,139f)。ただし、この点をもっぱら強調する単純な「論理≠歴史」説もまた一面的であると言わざるをえない。「論理と歴史」論争に関する先行研究においては、久留間(1969a,97H)の先駆的研究を除き、ポリティカル・エコノミー批判の方法として「論理と歴史」の関係が位置づけられてこなかった。近年では中村(2001)も「資本主義的生産関係」の「現状分析」とは区別された「歴史分析」を把握している。しかし、「形態分析」(現状分析)と「歴史的考察」の区別を理解するだけで両者の関係が考察されてはいない。私たちはむしろ、マルクスのポリティカル・エコノミー批判において形態分析と歴史分析がどのような関連にあるのかを明らかにすべきなのだ。 マルクスは、『資本論』第一巻を締め括る最終篇「本源的蓄積」において、それ以前の篇における資本主義的生産様式そのものを対象とする形態分析とは別に、資本主義的生産様式の「歴史的生成」および「成立条件」を考察している。重要なことは、こうした歴史的考察が資本主義的生産様式内部における経済的形態規定の論理分析とは明確に区別されるという点である。例えば、『資本論』第三部で分析される利子生み資本は、資本概念がもっとも発展した現象形態であるが、歴史的には「資本の大洪水以前的形態」である高利資本として存在している。つまり歴史的には、商品や貨幣と同様に、資本でさえもまた資本主義以前から存在していたのである。しかし、マルクスの形態分析は、エンゲルスとは異なり、歴史的に実在した経済的形態規定を考察したものではない。じじつ、『資本論』第一巻第四章「貨幣の資本への転化」においても、資本の分析を始めるにあたって、資本の生成史をひとまず度外視することが強調されている。 歴史的には、資本は、どこでも最初はまず貨幣の形態で、貨幣財産すなわち商人資本および高利資本として、土地所有に相対する。とはいえ、貨幣を資本の最初の現象形態として認識するためには、資本の成立史を回顧する必要はな同じ歴史が、日々われわれの目の前で繰り広げられている。(MEGAII/6,165)”翻译为中文","output":"因此，作为经济学批判方法，只有逻辑上的处理才是恰当的。然而，这种逻辑上的处理实际上不外乎是一种剥离了历史形态和混乱的偶然事件之后的历史处理方法。从“资产阶级社会”的历史开始的地方，思想的进展也必须开始，而且此后的进展将不过是以抽象且理论上连贯的形态反映历史过程的镜像。虽然是经过修正的镜像，但所谓修正，是因为每一个机遇都可以在其发展达到完全成熟和典型形态的时刻进行考察，根据实际历史过程自身提供的法则进行修正。（MEGAII/2,253） 正如我们在第三章中看到的，马克思在《资本论》第一卷的开头就从商品分析开始了对政治经济学的批判。“在资本主义生产方式占主导地位的社会中，财富表现为‘一大堆商品’，单个商品则表现为财富的要素形态。”（MEGAII/6,69）。在理解这里“商品”范畴时，恩格斯的“逻辑=历史”论在马克思主义者之间产生了巨大影响。根据恩格斯的说法，《资本论》开头展开的“商品论”，不仅适用于商品生产关系全面化的资本主义社会，也适用于历史上实际存在的简单商品生产社会。确实，商品和货币在资本主义之前的生产系统中也广泛存在，这一点无疑是被普遍认可的。如果是这样，根据马克思的逻辑方法揭示的经济形态规定的逻辑（简单来说就是“价值法则”的机制），不仅在资本主义社会中，也应当贯彻于先于资本主义的简单商品生产社会中。然而，恩格斯的“逻辑=历史”论忽视了一个事实，即马克思的政治经济学批判毕竟是属于资本主义社会系统特有的形态分析（Carver1983,139f）。当然，单纯强调“逻辑≠历史”的立场同样是片面的。在关于“逻辑与历史”的争议的先行研究中，除了久留间（1969a,97H）的开创性研究外，尚未有工作将政治经济学批判的方法定位为“逻辑与历史”的关系。近年来，中村（2001）也认识到了与“当前分析”不同的“历史分析”。然而，尽管理解了“形态分析”（当前分析）和“历史考察”的区别，但两者之间的关系尚未被探讨。我们反而应当明确在马克思的政治经济学批判中，形态分析与历史分析是如何相关的。 马克思在《资本论》第一卷的最后一部分“原始积累”中，除了对资本主义生产方式本身进行的形态分析之外，还考察了资本主义生产方式的“历史生成”以及“成立条件”。重要的是，这种历史考察与资本主义生产方式内部的经济形态规定的逻辑分析是明确区分开的。例如，在《资本论》第三部分分析的利息生产资本，虽然是资本概念最为发达的表现形态，但历史上却是作为“资本大洪水之前形态”的高利资本存在的。也就是说，历史上，商品和货币一样，连资本本身也是存在于资本主义之前的。然而，马克思的形态分析与恩格斯不同，并不是考察历史上实际存在的经济形态规定。实际上，在《资本论》第一卷第四章“货币向资本转化”中，在开始资本分析时，强调暂时忽略资本的生成史。 历史上，资本首先以货币的形态出现，作为商人资本和高利资本，与土地所有权相对立。然而，为了认识货币作为资本的最初表现形态，无需回顾资本的成立史，同样的历史每天都在我们眼前展开。（MEGAII/6,165）"},{"instruction":"请将“大谷禎之介によれば、マルクスは、『要綱」や「経済学批判。原初稿」において、「資本を概念的に把握したのちに、資本の生成に「先行した歴史的発展」を考察することの意味についてあちこち立ち入って述べて」いる(大谷2016b,384)。「導出論争」において看過されたことだが、ポリティカル・エコノミー1批判の方法として、資本を理論的に把握する「形態分析」と資本生成に関する「歴史的考察」との関連性を把握しておくことは決定的に重要である。マルクスは、資本の形態分析として「ブルジョワ経済の諸法則を展開する」際に、資本の成立史をさしあたり度外視する。それは、「われわれの目の前で」、しかも日常的に、貨幣が資本へと転化せざるをえないことを明らかにするためであった。ただし、マルクスが注意を促しているように、こうした形態分析だけでポリティカル・エコノミー批判が完結するわけではない。 資本の存在は、社会の経済的姿態形成の長期にわたる歴史的過程の結果である。弁証法的形態で叙述することは、自己の諸限界をわきまえている場合のみ正しいのだということが、この地点〔貨幣の資本への移行を論ずる地点ではっきりと分かる。われわれにとっては資本の一般的概念がもたらされるのは単純流通の考察からである。なぜなら、ブルジョワ的生産様式の内部では、単純流通そのものが、資本の前提であるとともに資本を前提しているものとして以外には、存在しないからである。資本が単純流通から生じると言ったからといっても、資本がある永遠の理念の化体になるわけではない。(MEGAII/2,91) このように、資本を概念的に考察する「弁証法的形態での叙述」すなわち形態分析は、それ自体限界をはらんでいる。それゆえ、『資本論』第一巻の「貨幣の資本への転化」に関する形態分析は、資本の歴史的生成に関する「本源的蓄積論」によって補足されなければならない。形態分析においては、「資本によって支配されている生産様式の現実のシステム」が考察対象であった。その一方で、歴史的考察においては、まさに「資本の生成、成立の諸条件および諸前提」、「資本生成の歴史的先行段階」が主題となる(MEGAII/1.2,368)。したがって、マルクスのポリティカル・エコノミー批判においては、まずもって資本概念が理論的に展開された後に、度外視されていた歴史的考察が形態分析の限界を補足しなければならないのだ。それは、資本を「永遠に変わらない、自然にかなった」生産形態と見なすブルジョワ経済学者たちのように、「資本の生成のための諸条件」を「資本の現実の実現のための諸条件」と混同しないためであった(ibid.,369)。さらにマルクスは、形態分析から区別された歴史的考察がどのような積極的意味をもつかについて次のように述べている。 われわれの方法は、歴史的考察がはいってこなければならない諸地点を、言い換えれば、生産過程のたんに歴史的な姿態にすぎないブルジョワ経済が自己を越えてそれ以前の歴史的な生産諸様式を指し示すにいたる諸地点を示している。だから、ブルジョワ経済の諸法則を展開するためには、生産諸関係の現実の歴史を記述する必要はない。とはいえ、この生産諸関係を、それ自体歴史的に生成した諸関係として正しく観察し演繹するならば、それはつねに、このシステムの背後にある過去を指し示すような、最初の諸方程式[…]に到達するのである。とすれば、これらの示唆は、現在あるものを正しく把握することとあいまって、過去の理解――これは一つの独立した仕事であって、これにもいずれは取り組みたいものだが心の鍵をも提供してくれる。(ibid.) マルクスの方法にとって、歴史学の実証的研究や「生産諸関係の現実の歴史を記述する」ことは主題とはなない。ポリティカル・エコノミー批判における歴史的考察の課題は、あくまでも「ブルジョワ経済の諸法則」を解明する形態分析を補足するために、資本生成の諸条件を把握することなのである。次の有名な『要綱』の文章は、この意味において理解されなければならない。「人間の解剖は、猿の解剖のための一つの鍵である。反対に、より低級な動物種類にあるより高級なものへの予兆は、このより高級なものじたいがすでに知られている場合にだけ、理解することができる」(MEGAII/1.1,40)。現在のシステム(人間)を分析することが、過去のシステム(猿)を分析する際の前提である。まずもって現在の資本主義社会を理解することによって、過去の前資本主義社会を理解するための鍵を手に入れることができる。”翻译为中文","output":"根据大谷禎之介的说法，马克思在《纲要》和《经济学批判。初稿》中多次深入地讨论了在概念上把握资本之后，考察资本生成“之前的历史发展”意义（大谷2016b，384）。在“导出论争”中被忽视的一点是，作为政治经济批判方法，理论上把握资本的“形态分析”与关于资本生成的“历史考察”的相关性是决定性重要的。马克思在进行资本的形态分析、展开“资产阶级经济的各个法则”时，暂时忽略了资本的成立史。这是为了明确“在我们面前”，而且是日常，货币不得不转化为资本的事实。但是，正如马克思所警告的，仅凭这种形态分析并不意味着完成了政治经济批判。 资本的存在是社会经济形态形成的长期历史过程的结果。只有在了解了自身局限性的情况下，以辩证法的形式叙述才是正确的，这一点在讨论货币向资本转变的地方变得非常明显。对我们来说，资本的一般概念是从简单流通的考察中得出的，因为在资产阶级生产方式内部，简单流通本身是前提，并且不存在于除了资本的前提之外的其他任何东西。（MEGAII/2，91） 因此，以辩证法形式叙述，即形态分析本身包含局限性。因此，《资本论》第一卷中关于“货币向资本的转化”的形态分析必须由资本的历史生成的“原始积累论”所补充。在形态分析中，考察的对象是“受资本控制的生产方式的实际系统”。而在历史考察中，主题正是“资本的生成、成立条件以及前提”，“资本生成的历史前阶段”（MEGAII/1.2，368）。因此，在马克思的政治经济批判中，首先必须在理论层面展开资本概念，然后用被忽视的历史考察补充形态分析的局限。这是为了避免像资产阶级经济学家那样将资本视为“永恒不变、自然合理”的生产形式，混淆“为资本的生成条件”和“为资本的实际实现条件”（ibid.，369）。此外，马克思还论述了历史考察与形态分析相区分的积极意义： 我们的方法指出了历史考察必须引入的地方，换句话说，资产阶级经济自身仅仅是生产过程的一个历史阶段，但它超越自我，指向早先历史生产模式的地方。因此，为了展开资产阶级经济的法则，没有必要描述生产关系的实际历史。然而，如果这些生产关系作为自身历史生成的关系被正确观察和推导，则它总是指向这一系统背后的过去，即达到最初的方程式[…]，因而，这些指示与正确把握现状相结合，为过去的理解——这是一个独立的工作，我也希望最终能着手进行——提供了心灵的钥匙。(ibid.) 对马克思的方法来说，历史学的实证研究或“描述生产关系的实际历史”并非主题。政治经济批判中的历史考察任务，是为了补充解明“资产阶级经济的法则”的形态分析，通过把握资本生成的各种条件。这一点在以下著名的《纲要》文字中，应该以这种意义理解：“人的解剖是猿解剖的一把钥匙。相反，只有在已知较高级生物时，才能理解较低级生物种类中较高级生物的预告。”（MEGAII/1.1，40）。分析当前系统（人）是分析过去系统（猿）的前提。首先理解当前的资本主义社会，才能获得理解过去的前资本主义社会的钥匙。"},{"instruction":"请将“つまり、過去の社会システムの理解それ自体は、ポリティカル・エコノミー批判における歴史的考察とは区別される「一つの独立した仕事」ということになる。したがって、ポリティカル・エコノミー批判における歴史的考察は単なる歴史分析ではないし、経済史や法制史などの実証的研究とも一線を画している。 導出論争では、形態分析と歴史的考察の関係がポリティカル・エコノミー批判の文脈において理解されてこなかった。しかし、本書の主題である「国家の形態分析」を再構成するうえでは次の点が重要である。すなわち、歴史的考察は、形態分析をたんに補足するにとどまらず、むしろ資本主義社会の歴史的位置が最終的に明らかになるという意味で、資本主義社会という対象の理論的分析を締め括るものでもあった(大谷2016b,392)。なぜなら、資本主義的生産様式の歴史的特殊性を考察することによって、資本主義的生産様式それ自体もまた過渡的な生産様式すなわち「新たな社会状態のための歴史的諸前提」として把握しうるからである(MEGAII/1.2,369)。したがって歴史的考察は、たんに形態分析と区別されるだけではなく、資本主義社会システムの理論的分析を締め括るという意味においてポリティカル・エコノミー批判の不可欠な構成部分なのだ。そうだとすれば、ポリティカル・エコノミー批判の延長線上で国家論を展開する形態分析にとっても、歴史的考察は同様の意味をもつと考えられる。したがって私たちは次のように問うべきだろう。資本主義社会システムを構成する国家の歴史的考察は、国家の形態分析それ自体とは区別されながらも、その不可欠な構成部分なのではないか、と。 国家の形態分析における歴史的考察の意味 第三章で見たように、資本主義社会システムにおいては、あらゆる人格的な支配・従属関係が解体しているため、暴力的な支配・従属関係が社会の経済的構造から分離し集権化した構造的権力という政治的形態を帯びる。しかし、ゲルステンベルガーの批判をふまえるならば、「国家の社会からの分離」という「資本主義の政治的形態」規定は、国家の形態分析としては未だ不十分である。資本主義的生産様式の形態分析がその歴史的考察によって補足されるのと同様に、国家の形態分析は、近代国家の歴史的起源とその資本主義国家への移行を考察する独自の歴史分析によって補足されなければならないのだ。つまり、国家を含む資本主義社会システムを総体として理論的に把握する形態分析は、資本主義的生産様式を総括する国家形態に関する歴史的考察によって締め括る必要がある。こうした観点から、歴史的には資本主義的生産様式に先行していた近代国家の形成過程を考察していきたい。 マルクスは、『資本論』第一巻「本源的蓄積」章において、「資本主義的経済秩序は、封建的経済秩序という母胎から生まれてきた。後者の解体が前者の構成諸要素を解放した」(MEGAII/7,633)と述べている。そして、「封建的経済秩序から資本主義的経済秩序への転化を急速に促進して過渡期を短縮」するために利用されるのが「国家権力、すなわち社会の集権化し組織された強制力」であるとされる(ibid.,668)。「封建制から資本主義への移行」に関する歴史的考察は、一四世紀から一八世紀にかけてのイングランド社会を主題とするものであった。マルクスは、本源的蓄積における国家権力の諸機能として、労賃引き下げ・労働日の延長・規律訓練を強制するために制定された一五世紀末以来の一連の法律、そして一七世紀末の「植民体制、公信用、近代財政、保護貿易システム」(ibid.)などを列挙している。ここで問題となるのは、資本主義的生産様式への移行を促進する経済外的権力としての国家が、社会の経済的構造から分離し集権化した強制力と定義されている点である。 ゲルステンベルガーの国家導出論批判を考慮するならば、ここでのマルクスの議論にたいして次のような疑問が生じるはずだ。マルクスが「本源的蓄積論」において言及している国家権力は、すでに「資本主義の政治的形態」を帯びたものとして前提されてしまっているのではないか。資本主義的生産様式に先行する近代国家は、果たして「ブルジョワ社会が自己を総括する国家」形態として理解できるのだろうか、と。たしかに、国家の形態分析を発展させるためには、マルクスが簡潔に定義した「社会の集権化し組織された強制力」という国家規定では不十分である。”翻译为中文","output":"即是，对过去社会系统的理解本身，在政治经济批判中的历史考察中被视为“一项独立的工作”。因此，在政治经济批判中的历史考察并不仅仅是简单的历史分析，也不是经济史或法制史等实证研究。 在导出论争中，形态分析和历史考察的关系并没有在政治经济批判的语境下被理解。然而，本书的主题是“国家形态分析”的重构，以下点是至关重要的：历史考察不仅仅是作为形态分析的补充，更在于最终明确地揭示资本主义社会的历史定位，即理解资本主义社会作为一个对象的理论分析的终结（大谷2016b,392）。因为通过考察资本主义生产方式的历史特殊性，资本主义生产方式本身也可以被理解为一个过渡性的生产方式，即作为“新社会状态的历史前提”（MEGAII/1.2,369）。因此，历史考察不仅与形态分析区别开来，也是政治经济批判中理论分析资本主义社会系统的必要组成部分。如果是这样，那么在政治经济批判的延伸上发展国家论的形态分析，同样也应该拥有历史考察相似的重要意义。因此，我们应该询问：构成资本主义社会系统的国家的历史考察，是否也是国家形态分析不可或缺的组成部分？ 国家形态分析中历史考察的意义 正如第三章所述，在资本主义社会系统中，所有个人支配和服从关系都被解构，暴力支配和服从关系从社会的经济结构中分离出来并集中化，形成了一种政治形态的结构性权力。然而，考虑到Gerstenberger的批评，“国家与社会的分离”作为“资本主义的政治形态”规定在国家形态分析中仍然不足。就像资本主义生产方式的形态分析需要通过历史考察来补充一样，国家的形态分析也必须通过对近代国家的历史起源和其向资本主义国家的转变的独特历史分析来补充。也就是说，对包括国家在内的资本主义社会系统的整体进行理论把握的形态分析，需要通过关于国家形态的历史考察来终结。从这个角度，我们希望考察资本主义生产方式之前存在的近代国家的形成过程。 马克思在《资本论》第一卷“原始积累”章节中指出：“资本主义经济秩序是从封建经济秩序的腹中诞生的。后者的解体解放了前者的构成要素”（MEGAII/7，633）。并且，“利用国家权力，即社会的集中和组织化的强制力，以迅速促进封建制向资本主义的转变，缩短过渡期”（ibid.，668）。关于“封建制向资本主义的转变”的历史考察主要关注从14世纪到18世纪英国社会。马克思列举了国家权力在原始积累中的各种功能，包括从15世纪末开始制定的一系列法律，旨在强制降低工资、延长工作日和纪律训练，以及17世纪末的“殖民制度、公共信贷、现代财政、保护贸易体系”（ibid.）。此处的问题是，国家作为推动资本主义生产方式转变的经济外部力量，被定义为从社会经济结构中分离出来并集中化的强力。 考虑到Gerstenberger对国家导出论的批评，这里的马克思的讨论应该引发以下疑问：马克思在“原始积累论”中提到的国家权力是否已经被前提为拥有“资本主义的政治形态”？先于资本主义生产方式的近代国家，真的可以被理解为“资产阶级社会概括自身的国家”形态吗？当然，为了发展国家形态分析，马克思简洁定义的“社会的集中和组织化的强制力”这一国家规定是不够的。"},{"instruction":"请将“とはいえ、マルクスにとって、おそらくこの規定は「資本の一般的分析」の枠内において要請された消極的なものにすぎなかった(そのため私たちは第三章において、いわば隠れた国家規定を「無産国家」として積極的に打ち出したのである)。なぜなら、『資本論』第一巻の「本源的蓄積論」における国家規定は、あくまでも資本主義的生産様式の形態分析を補足するものにすぎないからだ。しかしながら、資本主義社会システムに不可欠な国家形態を理論的に展開するためには、近代国家の歴史的考察がさらに要求されるのである。それゆえ私たちは、そもそも資本主義的生産様式に先行する近代国家権力がどのようにして形成されてきたかを考察し、積極的に国家の形態分析を発展させなければならない。これはマルクス自身が果たせなかった国家批判の課題でもある。 ゲルステンベルガーは、イングランドとフランスの比較歴史学的な考察にもとづいて「近代国家(および資本主義)は、封建的構造からではなく、まさしく特殊歴史的な諸条件から生じえたのであって、私はそれをアンシャン・レジームという用語で総括する」と述べている(Gerstenberger2006,23)「導出論争」においてブランケらは、「法の一般性」や国家の公共性を資本主義国家の機能として導出した。しかし、ゲルステンベルガーによれば、いわゆる法治国家は、アンシャン・レジーム時代の西ヨーロッパ社会のもとで歴史的に形成されたものにすぎない。「ブルジョワ国家の最も一般的な形態、すなわち政治と経済の分離は、資本主義的関係が優勢であることの構造的な結果ではなくその構造的前提である」(Gerstenberger2006,473)。確かにゲルステンベルガーは、マルクスの「本源的蓄積論」が単なる歴史分析ではなく、資本主義的生産様式の形態分析を補足する歴史的考察であることを看過している。しかし、近代国家そのものが「政治と経済の分離」を構造的に前提としており、しかも資本主義に先行して形成されてきたという指摘は、国家の形態分析がもつ難点を的確についたものであった。 すでに見たように、マルクスにとって資本主義的生産様式の歴史的考察は、主としてイングランド社会における直接的生産者の脱所有化(生産手段からの本源的分離)を分析するだけで十分であった。というのも、「本源的蓄積」論の核心は、資本主義の農村的起源、つまり農村における生産関係の実質的変化(いわゆる「農業革命」)を把握することにあったからだ(Wood2002)。ブレナーが述べているように、イングランドの農業資本主義は、農業改良によって多くの人口が工業部門に参入することを促進したばかりか、イングランドの工業発展の本質的な構成要素であった国内市場の成長を可能にしたのである(Brenner1985a,53)。しかし、これとは対照的に、ゲルステンベルガーの「国家の歴史社会学」においては、資本主義の構造的前提としてまずもって「ブルジョワ国家」のフランスが主要な考察対象となる。近代国家の歴史的考察においては、イングランド資本主義の歴史的考察だけでは不十分なのだ。それでは、「アンシャン・レジーム」の西ヨーロッパ社会において、いかにして「政治と経済の分離」が形成されてきたのだろうか 「アンシャン・レジーム」における近代国家の形成 ゲルステンベルガーの「アンシャン・レジーム」概念は、後述するようにフランス革命以前の「旧体制」を単に意味しない。トクヴィルの古典的著作『旧体制と大革命』においても、アンシャン・レジームとは、フランス特有のものではなく一四世紀ヨーロッパの「古い基本体制」の遺産を意味していた(Doyle2001)。この理論枠組みは、階級論モデルをとらないゲルステンベルガー自身は留保しているが、マルクス主義歴史思想家のペリー・アンダーソンが独自に展開した「絶対主義」概念に相当すると考えてよい。そこでゲルステンベルガーの「アンシャンレジーム」論を考察するまえに、かれの『絶対主義国家の系譜』(Anderson1974,Pt.1)の分析を参照しておきたい。”翻译为中文","output":"然而，对于马克思来说，这一规定可能只是在“资本的一般分析”框架内被提出的一种消极要求（因此我们在第三章中积极地以“无产阶级国家”为概念提出了一种隐含的国家规定）。这是因为，《资本论》第一卷中的“原始积累论”中的国家规定，仅仅是对资本主义生产方式形态分析的补充而已。然而，为了理论化不可或缺的资本主义社会系统中的国家形态，对近代国家的历史考察是进一步需要的。因此，我们必须探讨近代国家权力是如何形成的，并且在先于资本主义生产方式的背景下积极发展国家的形态分析。这也是马克思自己未能完成的国家批判任务。 Gerstenberger根据对英国和法国的比较历史学研究，提出了“近代国家（以及资本主义）不是从封建结构中产生，而是确实从特殊的历史条件中产生的，我将这些条件总结为‘旧体制’这一术语”(Gerstenberger2006,23)。在“导出论争”中，Blanke等人从资本主义国家的功能中导出了“法律的普遍性”和国家的公共性。然而，据Gerstenberger称，所谓的法治国家实际上是在旧体制时期的西欧社会历史上形成的。“资产阶级国家最普遍的形态，即政治与经济的分离，不是资本主义关系占主导地位的结构性结果，而是它的结构性前提”(Gerstenberger2006,473)。当然，Gerstenberger忽视了马克思的“原始积累论”并非仅仅是历史分析，而是对资本主义生产方式的形态分析的补充性历史考察。但是，她指出近代国家本身就是在“政治与经济的分离”作为结构性前提的情况下形成的，并且是在资本主义之前形成的，这一点准确地触及了国家形态分析的问题所在。 正如我们已经看到的，对于马克思来说，资本主义生产方式的历史考察主要足以分析英国社会中直接生产者的剥夺（从生产手段中的原始分离）。这是因为，“原始积累”论的核心在于把握资本主义的农村起源，即农村中生产关系的实质变化（所谓的“农业革命”）(Wood2002)。正如Brenner所述，英国的农业资本主义不仅通过农业改进促进了更多人口进入工业部门，而且使英国工业发展的基本要素之一——国内市场的增长成为可能(Brenner1985a,53)。然而，与此相反，Gerstenberger的“国家的历史社会学”主要关注作为资本主义结构性前提的法国“资产阶级国家”。在近代国家的历史考察中，仅仅考察英国资本主义的历史是不够的。那么，在“旧体制”的西欧社会中，是如何形成“政治与经济的分离”的呢？ “旧体制”下近代国家的形成 Gerstenberger对“旧体制”的概念，正如我们将要讨论的那样，并不仅仅意味着法国大革命前的“旧体系”。正如Tocqueville在他的经典著作《旧制度与大革命》中所指出的，旧体制并不是法国独有的，而是指14世纪欧洲“旧基本制度”的遗产(Doyle2001)。虽然Gerstenberger本人对采用非阶级论模型持保留态度，但她的理论框架可被视为与马克思主义历史思想家佩里·安德森自行发展的“绝对主义”概念相当。在探讨Gerstenberger的“旧体制”论之前，我们将参考其《绝对主义国家的系谱》(Anderson1974,Pt.1)的分析。"},{"instruction":"请将“アンダーソンは、東西ヨーロッパの絶対主義諸体制を比較することで、マルクス主義の観点からいわば「絶対主義国家の歴史社会学」をうち立てた。一般に伝統的なマルクス主義歴史学においては、一六世紀から一八世紀にかけて封建貴族とブルジョワジーの勢の勢力均衡のなかで絶対主義国家が発展したと考えられてきた。例えば『宣言』ではこう述べられている。「マニュファクチュア時代には、ブルジョワジーは身分的君主制あるいは絶対君主制において貴族にたいする平衡をたもつ錘であり、大君主国一般の主要な基礎であった」(MEW4,464)。しかし、アンダーソンによれば、絶対主義国家は、貴族とブルジョワとの仲裁人でもないし、台頭するブルジョワが貴族に対抗するために使用される道具でもない。絶対主義国家はむしろ、政治的危機にさらされた封建的貴族が伝統的特権を保護するために新たに生み出した権力装置なのである。その意味で、絶対主義国家は資本主義社会の経済的構造に完全に対応した政治的形態ではない。じじつ、絶対主義国家においては、貨幣経済の拡大と商人・ブルジョワの成長の産物として「官職売買」が横行していたが、こうした慣習は貴族を頂点とする封建的ヒエラルヒーにブルジョワを統合するための制度にほかならなかった。アンダーソンによれば、封建的貴族を保護するための手段が同時に商人やブルジョワの利害を保証するという矛盾を絶対主義国家は抱えていたというのである。とはいえ、限定的ではあれブルジョワの諸利害を補完する国家機能は、それ以前の政治的共同体(専制国家やポリス)とは異なる、絶対主義国家の近代的性格を示している。マルクスが『資本論』第一巻で展開したように、こうした国家機能こそが資本主義的生産様式への移行において本源的蓄積の諸契機をなしたのである。 ただし、フランスの社会学者であるバディとビルンボームが批判するように、アンダーソンの国家論は、伝統的マルクス主義の道具主義モデルに依拠している点で限界がある(Badie&Birnbaum1979,153)。じじつ、伝統的マルクス主義が主導してきたフランス革命史研究は、トクヴィルの「アンシャン・レジーム論」に依拠する社会史家たちによって大幅な修正を迫られてきた(Furet1978,34)。つまり、ブルジョワ革命による「断絶」説を強調する伝統的マルクス主義にたいして、修正主義的解釈はむしろ中央集権的な近代国家権力がすでに絶対主義時代において形成されていたと主張したのである。こうした見解は、「国家の社会学」において共通の認識となっているものだ。バディとビルンボームは、アンシャン・レジーム時代の西ヨーロッパ社会において、近代国家が資本主義に先行して形成されてきたことを次のように要約している。「国家は、資本主義の産物でもなければ、貿易路の開設の所産でもなく、ましてや工業の飛躍的発達から生まれたものではなく、[…]高度に封建化した社会機構による異例の抵抗を受けながら、さらには深刻化する領主の政治的無能と、経済的・社会的生活にたいする領主の強力な統制とを両立させながら、分業の時代に直面したヨーロッパがとらなければならなかった政治の方式」である(Badie&Birnbaum1979,243-4)。 マルクスとフランス革命 すでに言及したように、マルクスは「クロイツナハ・ノート」や「フランス三部作」等でフランスの近代国家形成史をよく研究していた。マルクス自身が、いわば近代フランス国家の歴史的考察として、資本主義に先行する絶対主義国家を把握している点は重要である。つまり、伝統的マルクス主義の国家論を批判した「国家の社会学」は、実のところマルクスのフランス国家論と同じような地平にあるのだ。じじつ、フランソワ・フュレが強調しているように、「マルクスにとってもトクヴィルにとっても、フランス革命は君主制の仕事を継承するものであった」(Furet1986,100)。スコチポルも同様に、主著『国家と社会革命』において、伝統的マルクス主義の「ブルジョワ革命」規定を批判しつつ、フランス革命をアンシャン・レジームの延長線上で把握している。”翻译为中文","output":"安德森通过比较东西欧洲的绝对主义体制，从马克思主义的角度构建了一种“绝对主义国家的历史社会学”。一般在传统的马克思主义历史学中，认为绝对主义国家是在16至18世纪封建贵族与资产阶级力量平衡中发展起来的。例如在《宣言》中就这样表述：“在手工业时代，资产阶级是在身份等级制度或绝对君主制下与贵族保持平衡的砝码，是一般大君主国的主要基础。”(MEW4,464)。然而，按照安德森的说法，绝对主义国家既不是贵族与资产阶级之间的调解者，也不是崛起的资产阶级用以对抗贵族的工具。绝对主义国家更像是面临政治危机的封建贵族为了保护传统特权而新创的权力装置。在这个意义上，绝对主义国家并不是与资本主义社会的经济结构完全对应的政治形态。事实上，在绝对主义国家中，作为货币经济扩张和商人、资产阶级成长的产物，“官职买卖”盛行，但这些习俗无非是将资产阶级整合入以贵族为顶点的封建等级制度中的机制。安德森认为，绝对主义国家承担着保护封建贵族同时保证商人或资产阶级利益的矛盾。即便如此，有限地补充资产阶级利益的国家功能，展示了绝对主义国家与之前的政治共同体（专制国家或城邦）不同的现代特质。正如马克思在《资本论》第一卷中所开展的，这些国家功能正是在向资本主义生产方式过渡中构成原始积累的各种契机。 然而，正如法国社会学家巴迪和比伦鲍姆所批判的，安德森的国家论在依赖传统马克思主义的工具主义模型方面有其局限。(Badie&Birnbaum1979,153)。事实上，传统马克思主义主导的法国革命史研究，已经被依赖托克维尔的“旧体制论”的社会史家进行了大幅修改(Furet1978,34)。即传统马克思主义强调的由资产阶级革命带来的“断裂”，而修正主义解释则更倾向于主张中央集权的现代国家权力已经在绝对主义时代形成。这种观点已成为“国家社会学”中的共识。巴迪和比伦鲍姆总结，在旧体制时代的西欧社会中，近代国家是先于资本主义形成的，“国家既不是资本主义的产物，也不是贸易路开辟的结果，更不是工业的飞跃性发展所带来的，[…] 在面对分工时代的欧洲不得不采取的政治方式，是在高度封建化的社会机构遭遇异常的抵抗，同时，在领主的政治无能和对经济、社会生活的强大控制之间找到平衡的过程中形成的。”(Badie&Birnbaum1979,243-4) 马克思与法国革命 正如我们已经提到的，马克思在《克罗伊岑纳笔记》和“法国三部曲”等作品中充分研究了法国近代国家的形成史。马克思自己作为对近代法国国家的历史考察，理解了先于资本主义的绝对主义国家是重要的。即攻击传统马克思主义的国家论的“国家社会学”，实际上与马克思的法国国家论处在相同的视角。事实上，正如弗朗索瓦·富雷特所强调的，“对于马克思和托克维尔而言，法国革命是继承了君主制工作的。”(Furet1986,100)。斯科奇波尔在其主要著作《国家与社会革命》中，也在批判传统马克思主义的“资产阶级革命”规定的同时，将法国革命理解为旧体制的延续。"},{"instruction":"请将“フランス革命の全体的帰結は、中央集権的な職業官僚制国家と、適度に大きな私的所有者と多くは中位で小規模の私的所有者によって支配された社会との共生存在として特徴付けられうる。このフランスの新体制において、国家はさらに社会構造的な転換を促進することを目指してはいなかった。その代わりに、新体制は自らを維持し、職業的あるいは官僚的な地位と私的所有および市場関係に基づく社会秩序を保証するようになっていた。さらに、増強する国家は今ではより自律的な土台において機能しうると同時に、富の私的保有者は今では(少なくとも少数だが)剰余を領有するために、国家の官職を購入するか政治的・司法的機構を直接利用するよりも、市場にもとづいて経済的利害を追求する傾向を強めたのだった。(Skocpol1979,204-5) スコチポルによれば、フランス革命は資本主義経済の発展を政治的に促進した「ブルジョワ革命」ではない。むしろ、アンシャン・レジームのもとで形成されてきた中央集権的な行政国家を最終的に完成させるものであった。このような観点はトクヴィルの「アンシャン・レジーム論」を継承したものである。私たちは、「国家の社会学」の研究成果をふまえつつ、伝統的マルクス主義のパラダイムに抗して、マルクス自身のフランス国家論を再読する必要があるだろう。じじつ、『ブリュメール』においてマルクスは、『宣言』の階級均衡論とは異なる観点から、フランス革命前後の近代国家形成史を次のように概観している。 膨大な官僚制組織と軍事組織をもち、大げさな国家機構をもつこの執行権力、〔…〕網膜のようにフランス社会の肉体に絡みついて、その全ての毛穴を塞いでいるこのおそろしい寄生体は、絶対君主制の時代に、封建制が衰退しているときに生成したものであり、それがその衰退の加速を助けたのである。土地所有者と都市の領主的特権は、同じくらい多い国家権力の属性に転化し、封建的な高位高官は、給料を受けとる官僚に転化し、対立し合う中世的絶対権力の乱雑な見本帳は、工場のように労働が分割され集中された国家権力の整然とした計画に転化した。第一次フランス革命は、ブルジョワ的な国民統一を創出するために、あらゆる局地的、地域的、地方的な特殊権-権力を打るという使命をもっていたので、絶対王政が開始したもの、つま中央集権化を発展させなければならなたが、同時に政府権力の範囲、属性、手先を発展させなければならなかった。ナポレオンがこの国家機構を完成させた。正統王朝の王政と七月王政は、ブルジョワ社会内部の分業が新しい利益集団つまり国家行政の新しい材料を創出するのに応じて増大する、大規模な分業以外には何も付け加えなかった。(MEGAI/11,178) マルクスの政治時論として有名な「フランス三部作」には、強大な常備軍および官僚制といった執行権力の(社会にたいする)寄生的性格が一貫して強調されている。ナポレオンのボナパルティズムは、ブルジョワジーあるいは総資本家が独自に政治的支配を行使できないフランスにおいて成立した政治体制だったが、マルクス主義政治理論家にとって、これはまさに資本主義における「国家の相対的自律性」を証明するものだった(Wippermann1983,78、西川1984,第4章)。例えば、オーストリアのSPD左派であったオットー・バウアーによれば、絶対王政は一六世紀から一八世紀にかけて封建貴族とブルジョワジーの勢力均衡のなかで発展し、ボナパルティズムは一九世紀の四八年革命以降にプロレタリアートとブルジョワジーの一時的勢力均衡の産物であったという(Bauer1936,128f)。しかし、伝統的マルクス主義のように、絶対王政やボナパルティズムをブルジョワジーとその他の階級との単なる階級均衡として把握してはならない。”翻译为中文","output":"法国大革命的总体结果可以被特征化为中央集权的职业官僚制国家与由相对较大的私有者以及多数中等及小规模的私有者支配的社会的共生存在。在这种法国的新体制下，国家并没有旨在进一步促进社会结构性的转变。相反，新体制维持了自身，并保障了基于职业或官僚地位以及基于私有和市场关系的社会秩序。同时，增强的国家现在可以在更为自主的基础上运作，而私有财富所有者现在（至少是少数）倾向于基于市场来追求经济利益，而不是购买国家职务或直接利用政治和司法机构来获取剩余。（Skocpol1979,204-5） 据斯科奇波尔所说，法国大革命并不是促进了资本主义经济发展的“资产阶级革命”。相反，它最终完成了旧体制下形成的中央集权行政国家。这种视角继承了托克维尔的“旧体制论”。在考虑“国家社会学”的研究成果的同时，我们需要抵抗传统的马克思主义范式，重新阅读马克思自己的法国国家论。事实上，在《雾月十八日》中，马克思从不同于《共产党宣言》的阶级平衡论的角度概述了法国大革命前后的现代国家形成史。 拥有庞大的官僚机构和军事机构、豪华的国家机构的这个行政权力，像寄生虫一样缠绕在法国社会的身体上，堵塞了它所有的毛孔，这个可怕的寄生体是在绝对君主制时代形成的，当封建制在衰落时，它加速了这一衰落的过程。土地所有者和城市的领主特权同样多地转化为国家权力的属性，封建的高官转变为领取薪水的官僚，相互对抗的中世纪绝对权力的杂乱样本转变为工厂式劳动分工的、有序的国家权力计划。第一次法国大革命为了创造资产阶级的国民统一而担负起摧毁所有地方性、地区性、局地性的特殊权力的使命，因此，绝对王政开始的东西，即中央集权，必须得到发展，同时也必须发展政府权力的范围、属性和代理。拿破仑完成了这个国家机构。正统王朝和七月王朝除了没有增加任何东西，只是响应于资产阶级社会内部的分工创造了新的利益团体，即国家行政的新材料，他们加剧了大规模分工。（MEGAI/11,178） 马克思的政论作为著名的“法国三部曲”，一贯强调了极权主义的行政权力（对社会的）寄生性特征。拿破仑的波拿巴主义是在资产阶级或总资本家不能自行行使政治支配的法国形成的政治体制，对马克思主义政治理论家来说，这正是资本主义中“国家相对自主性”的证明。（Wippermann1983,78，西川1984,第4章）。例如，奥地利社会民主党的左翼奥托·鲍威尔认为，绝对王政是在16至18世纪封建贵族与资产阶级力量平衡中发展起来的，而波拿巴主义是19世纪48年革命之后无产阶级与资产阶级短暂力量平衡的产物。（Bauer1936,128f）。然而，我们不应像传统马克思主义那样，将绝对王政或波拿巴主义简单理解为资产阶级与其他阶级之间的纯粹阶级平衡。"},{"instruction":"请将“マルクスの「フランス三部作」においてまず注目すべき点は、「国家の歴史社会学」と同様に、アンシャン·レジーム時代にすでに「近代国家」が形成されていたことである。ただし、マルクスはこの点を強調していただけではない。より重要なのは次の事実である。つまり、伝統的マルクス主義の「ブルジョワ革命」概念とは反対に、フランス革命がむしろ資本主義的生産様式への移行を引き起こさなかったということだ。『ブリュメール』ではこの点について次のように述べられている。「ブルジョワジーは、国家機構を自分たちの過剰人口の就職先としており、利潤、利子、地代、謝礼金というかたちでせしめとることのできないものを、国家の俸給というかたちで埋め合わせている」(MEGAI/11,178)。ウッドによれば、ここでの「「ブルジョワジー」は根本的には資本家ではないのであって、ブルジョワジーの経済的利害はあまりに強く国家に根ざしている」(Wood2020)。つまり、「ブルジョワ」と「資本家」は概念的に区別されるというわけだ。著名な国制史家であるオットー・ブルンナーもこう述べている。「ブルジョワという言葉は、シトワイアンと同じく、もともと古いタイプの町の市民の呼称であったが、一七・一八世紀には手工業の親方、工業企業家という意味を帯びるようになった。ここからしてそれを「資本家」と等置する道が開けたのである」(Brunner1968,139)。政治的マルクス主義のコムニネルも、『フランス革命を再考する』という著作で伝統的マルクス主義の「ブルジョワ」概念を批判している。当時のブルジョワは、資本家階級を意味するのではなく、大部分が「法律家、非貴族的官職所有者-書記官、行政官、下級判事など」によって構成されていたというのだ。したがって、フランスのブルジョワ革命は確かに「契約による所有関係、法の支配、中央集権国家など」を生み出したが、イングランドとは異なり、資本主義の勃興に必要な社会関係を全く不十分にしか創出しなかったと結論づけられる(Comninel1987,180/203)。 アンシャン・レジームのもとで形成されてきたフランスの絶対主義国家は、依然として貴族を中心とする「宮廷社会」(エリアス)を基盤とし、小農大衆の土地所有権を補完するという封建的性格をもっていた。しかし、この近代的な国家権力は、フランス革命以降に、多様な社団のネットワークにもとづくアンシャンレジジームが解体し(二宮1979,213)、私的利害の対立にもとづくブルジョワ社会が拡大するにつれて新たな性格を獲得する。じじつ、こうした観点は一八五〇年代の前二作に対してポリティカル・エコノミー研究が深化した七〇年代に執筆された、『フランスの内乱』でいっそう強調されている。 常備軍、警察、官僚、聖職者、裁判官という、いたるところにゆきわたった諸機関―体系的で階層制的な 分業の方式にしたがってつくりあげられた諸機関をもつ中央集権的な国家権力は、絶対君主制の時代に始まるものであって、生まれかけていた中間階級社会にとって、封建制度とたたかうための強力な武器として役立った。とはいえ、この国家権力の発展は、あらゆる種類の中世的ながらくた、すなわち領主権や、地方的特権や、都市およびギルドの独占や、地方的法制によって、なお妨げられていた。一八世紀のフランス革命の巨大な箒は、過ぎさった時代のこれらの遺物をことごとく一掃し、こうして同時に社会の土壌から、近代的な国家構成物という上部構造の成立を妨げていた最後の障害物を取り除いた。[…]社会の経済的変化心ともなって政府の政治的性格も変化した。近代工業の進歩が資本と労働の階級的敵対性を発展させ、拡大し、強化するのと歩調をともにして、国家権力は、労働にたいする資本のナショナルな権力、社会的奴隷化のために組織さ組織された公的強制力、階級性格をますますおびるようになった。(MEGA1/22,137) ”翻译为中文","output":"在马克思的“法国三部曲”中首先应当注意到的一点是，与“国家的历史社会学”相似，在旧体制时代已经形成了“近代国家”。然而，马克思不仅强调了这一点。更重要的是以下事实：与传统马克思主义的“资产阶级革命”概念相反，法国革命并没有引发向资本主义生产方式的转变。在《雾月十八日》中提到了这一点：“资产阶级把国家机构作为其过剩人口的就业地，不可通过利润、利息、地租、回扣等形式获得的部分，以国家的薪酬形式弥补。”（MEGAI/11,178）。据伍德所言，“这里的‘资产阶级’根本不是资本家，资产阶级的经济利益与国家根深蒂固地相连”（Wood2020）。著名的国制史学家奥托·布伦纳也表示：“‘资产阶级’这个词，和市民一样，最初是对旧式城镇居民的称呼，但在17至18世纪开始具有了手工业师傅、工业企业家等意义。这为将其与‘资本家’等同开辟了道路。”（Brunner1968,139）。政治马克思主义者科姆尼尔在他的作品《重新考察法国革命》中批评了传统马克思主义的“资产阶级”概念。当时的资产阶级并不意味着资本家阶级，而大多由“法律家、非贵族的官职持有者——书记、行政官、初级法官等”构成。因此，可以得出结论，法国的资产阶级革命虽然确实产生了“基于契约的所有权、法治、中央集权国家等”，但与英国不同，它几乎没有创造出资本主义兴起所需的社会关系（Comninel1987,180/203）。 旧体制下形成的法国绝对主义国家，仍然基于以贵族为中心的“宫廷社会”（埃利亚斯）为基础，并具有补充小农民土地所有权的封建性质。然而，这种现代国家权力在法国革命之后获得了新的特性，随着各种社团网络基础上的旧体制解体（二宫1979，213），基于私人利益冲突的资产阶级社会扩张。事实上，这一观点在70年代撰写的《法国内战》中得到了更强调，相比于1850年代前两部作品对政治经济研究的深化。 拥有常备军、警察、官僚、神职人员、法官等遍布各处的机构——按照系统化和层级化的分工方式构建的中央集权国家权力，始于绝对君主制时代，对于正在形成的中产阶级社会来说，它成为与封建制度作斗争的有力武器。尽管如此，这种国家权力的发展还是被各种中世纪的杂物所阻碍，即领主权、地方特权、城市和行会的垄断、地方法律等。18世纪法国大革命的巨大扫帚清除了过去时代的这些遗物，从而同时从社会的土壤中移除了阻碍现代国家结构的上层建筑成立的最后障碍物。[…]社会的经济变革伴随着政府的政治性格的变化。随着近代工业的发展促进了资本与劳动的阶级对立的发展、扩大和加强，国家权力越来越成为资本对劳动的国家力量、为社会性奴役而组织起来的公共强制力、越来越具有阶级性质。（MEGA1/22，137）"},{"instruction":"请将“前半部分では、『ブリュメール』と同様に、アンシャン・レジーム時代、すなわち資本主義が発展する以前に「近代国家」が形成されていたことが強調されている。それに対して、後半の強調した部分では、大革命を経て「上部構造」としていわば純化した近代国家が、一九世紀以降の資本主義的生産様式の発展に対応するかたちで新たな政治的形態を帯びる点が強調されている。というのも、一八七〇年代の第三共和政期フランスでは、イングランドに続いてようやく「本源的蓄積」を完了させることで、資本主義的生産様式への移行を果たしつつあったからである。じじつ、フランスにおいて本来の意味でのブルジョワ社会、すなわち資本主義的生産様式が成立するのは一九世紀後半以降であった(Wippermann1983,73、Comninel1987,204)。こうして、政治革命としてのフランス革命ではなく、その後の本源的蓄積過程、すなわち生産様式における社会革命の結果として、近代国家は新たな政治的形態を帯びるようになる。つまり、資本主義的生産様式の確立によって「資本のもとへの国家機構の完全な従屈」(MEGAII/1.2,614)が生じ、近代国家が新たに「ブルジョワ社会が自己を総括する」形態規定を獲得するのだ。こうして資本主義国家は、近代国家に特徴的な「中央集権的」性格のみならず、「労働にたいする資本のナショナルな権力」という形態を帯びるようになる。 近代国家から「資本の国家」への移行 アンシャンレジームのもとで形成された近代国家は、資本主義的生産様式の発展に対応して、国家機能が経済的形態規定に制約された「資本の国家」へと転化する。このような観点は、何も「フランス三部作」に見られるフランス国家に特殊な議論ではない。マルクスの「経済学批判。原初稿」においても、絶対主義時代における近代国家の起源とその資本主義国家への移行に関する「歴史的考察」を見いだすことができる。 絶対君主制は、それ自体がすでに、ブルジョワ的富が古い封建的諸関係とは相容れない段階にまで発展したところの産物なのであるが、絶対君主制は、周辺のあらゆる地点において同一形態の一般的権力を行使することができなければならないことに対応して、こうした権力の物質的梃子として一般的等価物を必要とした。〔…〕絶対君主制は貨幣形態にある富を必要としたのだ。(MEGAII/2,19) 「国家の歴史社会学」は、アンシャン・レジームにおいて国家の軍事・財政機能が拡大することを強調しているが、絶対主義国家の軍事・財政力は基本的に小農大衆によって生み出された剰余生産物を収奪する経済外的強制力に依拠していた。しかし、資本主義的生産様式への移行を背景として、近代国家は、これまでどおり権力分散的でアナーキーな封建的関係を補完する一方で、ナショナルな領域全体に対して同一の「一般的権力」を行使するためにその経済的基礎としての貨幣税に依存するようになる。じじつ、一定の領域を統治する近代国家の軍事・財政力は、第三章で検討したように、資本主義的生産様式が発展するにつれて、貨幣や資本といった経済的形態規定に制約されざるをえなくなってゆく。しかし、逆に言えば近代国家は、市場を媒介とした資本による剰余価値の領有を補完する限りにおいて、自らの軍事・財政機能をますます強化しうるのである。こうした経済的形態規定への依存性こそが、「無産国家」という資本主義国家の形態規定性なのであった。じじつ、アメリカの社会学者であるバリントン・ムーアが先駆的に指摘したように、資本主義的生産様式の確立がフランスに先行したイングランドでは、近代国家の資本主義国家への移行がいち早く進展したのである(Moore1966,Pt.1)。政治的マルクス主義者で、ゲルステンベルガーと同様に国家の歴史社会学の研究成果を重視したベンノ・テシィケもこう要約している。「ヨーロッパ大陸の隣国と比べて最大の違いは、一八世紀の「財政=軍事国家」イギリスが、生産的な資本主義経済、ますます合理化する国家装置、そして統一された支配階級が最終的には合意して推進する国策に支えられていた点である」(Teschke2003,262-3)。”翻译为中文","output":"在前半部分中，与《雾月十八日》一样，强调旧体制时代，即资本主义发展之前，已经形成了“近代国家”。而在后半部分强调的是，经历大革命后作为“上层建筑”得以精炼的近代国家，随着19世纪以降资本主义生产方式的发展，呈现出新的政治形态。这是因为，在19世纪70年代的第三共和国时期的法国，继英国之后，通过完成“原始积累”过程，正在完成向资本主义生产方式的过渡。实际上，法国真正意义上的资产阶级社会，即资本主义生产方式的确立是在19世纪后半叶之后（Wippermann1983,73，Comninel1987,204）。因此，政治革命即法国革命，而不是之后的原始积累过程，即生产方式中的社会革命的结果，近代国家呈现出新的政治形态。即通过资本主义生产方式的确立，“国家机构对资本的完全服从”（MEGAII/1.2,614）发生，近代国家获得了新的“资产阶级社会自我概括”的形态规定。因此，资本主义国家不仅具有近代国家特有的“中央集权”性格，还呈现出“对劳动的资本的国家权力”的形态。 从近代国家到“资本的国家”的转变 旧体制下形成的近代国家，随着资本主义生产方式的发展，国家功能受到经济形态规定的制约，转变为“资本的国家”。这一观点不仅特定于“法国三部曲”中所见的讨论。在马克思的“经济学批判。原初稿”中也可以找到关于绝对主义时代近代国家起源及其向资本主义国家转变的“历史考察”。 “绝对君主制本身已是资产阶级财富在与旧封建关系不相容的阶段上发展得的产物，为了对应于处处行使同一形式的一般性权力，绝对君主制需要通用货币作为其权力的物质杠杆。[…]绝对君主制需要货币形态的财富。”（MEGAII/2,19） “国家的历史社会学”强调旧体制下国家的军事和财政功能的扩大，但绝对主义国家的军事和财政力量基本上依赖于对小农大众产生的剩余产品的经济外强制性掠夺。然而，随着资本主义生产方式的过渡，近代国家既补充了分散的、无政府状态的封建关系，同时也依赖于货币税收作为其经济基础来对整个国家领域行使“一般性权力”。实际上，如同第三章所讨论的那样，随着资本主义生产方式的发展，掌管一定领域的近代国家的军事和财政力量被经济形态规定如货币和资本所制约。然而，反过来说，只要近代国家能在市场媒介下通过资本对剩余价值的占有来补充自身的军事和财政功能，它就能进一步加强自己。这种对经济形态规定的依赖性，正是“资本的国家”的形态规定性。实际上，正如美国社会学家巴林顿·摩尔先驱指出的那样，由于资本主义生产方式的确立先于法国的英国，近代国家向资本主义国家的转变在那里更早发生（Moore1966,Pt.1）。政治马克思主义者且像Gerstenberger一样重视国家的历史社会学研究成果的Benno Teschke也总结道：“与欧洲大陆的邻国相比，18世纪的‘财政-军事国家’英国最大的不同，在于它由生产性的资本主义经济、越来越合理化的国家机构，以及最终由统治阶级共同推进的国家政策所支撑。”(Teschke2003,262-3)"},{"instruction":"请将“アンシャン・レジームのもとで形成された近代国家は、資本の蓄積過程において階級的敵対関係が発展するにつれて、封建的貴族やブルジョワジーといった支配階級の単なる道具ではなく、一定のナショナルな領域において資本の専制を貫徹するという「資本主義の政治的形態」規定を新たに獲得するようになる。この点はマルクスが「フランス三部作」最後の『フランスの内乱』においてはっきりと強調していたことでもある。私たちは、近代国家とその「資本の国家」への移行を歴史的に考察することで、近代の絶対主義国家とは異なる、資本主義国家の形態規定をより明確化できるのだ。 他方、国家の歴史的考察に補足された国家の形態分析は、資本主義国家の軍事・財政力の限界を見定め、国家に過大な機能や能力を付与するステイティズムを回避することを可能にする。ティリーらの「国家の社会学」は、一八世紀まで主として領域国家だった近代国家が一九世紀になって本格的に国民国家へと転化したと主張している(佐藤2014,第6章)。例えば、『ソーシャル・パワー』という大作で知られる歴史社会学者のマイケル・マンは、この軍事国家から民事国家への歴史的転換を、国家の「インフラ権力」に見いだしている。「インフラ権力とは、専制的であるか否かに関わりなく、中央国家がその支配領域に浸透し、その決定をロジスティックスの面で実行に移す制度的能力のことである。これは集合的な権力、社会を「つうじての権力」のことであって、国家のインフラをつうじて社会生活全般を調整している。これによって国家は、その領域内を中央から放射線状に浸透する様々な制度と見なされる」(Mann1993,59)。しかし、国家の形態分析にとって重要なのは次の問いである。なぜ一九世紀以降の近代国家が、領域内の住民を、たんに強制力によって収奪するのではなく、「国民」として組織する必要があったのだろうか。 むろん、ここでの国民国家は、経済的形態規定を補完する「資本主義の政治的形態」との関連において理解されなければならない。そうでなければ、次章で詳述するように、家族や人口に関する「社会政策」が国家行動の主要因である理由を説明できないだろう。一九世紀以降、国家の機能は、領域内部の成員の「私的所有」を外的に補完し、労働力再生産を補完する機能へと特殊化する。結局のところ、「国家の社会学」は資本主義国家に固有の形態的機能を把握できず、「国家の国民化」をたんに国家機能・能力の拡大として理解してしまうのだ。しかし、形態分析によれば、資本主義国家はその多様な機能・能力においてどれほど自律性を高めることができようとも、究極的には経済的形態規定に制約されるほかない。近代国家は資本主義的生産様式に先行するが、資本主義的生産様式の確立と発展にともなって、国家機能が経済的形態規定に制約された資本主義国家へと転化せざるをえない。この点はくり返し強調しておく必要がある。というのも、もし近代国家と「資本の国家」の形態規定を混同するならば、国家に過大な機能や能力を付与するステイティズムに陥ってしまうからだ。スティティズムは「アンシャン・レジーム」期に展開した軍事=財政拡張競争に着目することで、近代国家の制度的能力とその自律性を強調した。しかしそれは、むしろ資本主義国家が経済的形態規定への依存性を深めることによって生み出された国家機能なのである。 ”翻译为中文","output":"在旧体制下形成的近代国家，在资本积累过程中随着阶级对立的发展，不再仅仅是封建贵族或资产阶级这些统治阶层的工具，而是在一个特定的国家领域内实施资本专制的“资本主义政治形式”的新要求。这一点在马克思的“法国三部曲”最后一部作品《法国的内乱》中被明确强调。通过历史地考察近代国家及其向“资本的国家”转变，我们能够更清楚地界定与近代的绝对主义国家不同的资本主义国家的形态要求。 另一方面，国家的历史考察补充了国家的形态分析，使得确定资本主义国家的军事和财政力量的限制，避免赋予国家过多的功能或能力这种国家主义态度成为可能。提里等人的“国家社会学”主张，直至18世纪为止主要是领土国家的近代国家在19世纪转变为本格的民族国家(Sato2014,第6章)。例如，以其重要著作《社会力量》而知名的历史社会学家迈克尔·曼，将这一从军事国家到民事国家的历史转变视为国家“基础权力”的体现。“基础权力是指无论是独裁还是其他形式，中央国家渗透其管辖区域并实施决策的制度能力。这是一种集体的权力，一种‘通过社会的权力’，通过国家基础设施调节社会生活的整体。这使得国家被视为从中心向外辐射入侵各种制度的网络”(Man1993,59)。然而，对于国家形态分析而言重要的问题是：为什么19世纪以后的近代国家需要将其领域内的居民不仅仅是通过强制力掠夺，而是作为“国民”来组织的原因是什么？ 当然，这里的民族国家必须在与“资本主义的政治形式”的经济形态要求的联系中理解。否则，如同下一章将详细说明的，无法解释“社会政策”关于家庭或人口的措施为什么成为国家行动的主要原因。从19世纪开始，国家功能特化为补充其领域内成员的“私有财产”并补充劳动力再生产的功能。最终，“国家社会学”无法把握资本主义国家固有的形态功能，仅将“国家的国民化”理解为国家功能和能力的扩展。然而，按照形态分析，即便资本主义国家在其多样化的功能和能力上获得了多大的自主性，最终还是受到经济形态要求的制约。近代国家虽然先于资本主义生产方式，但随着资本主义生产方式的确立和发展，国家功能不可避免地受到经济形态要求的制约而转变为资本主义国家。这一点需要反复强调。因为如果混淆了近代国家与“资本的国家”的形态规定，就会陷入赋予国家过多功能和能力的国家主义误区。国家主义强调了“旧体制”期间展开的军事-财政扩张竞争，突出了近代国家的制度能力和其自主性。但实际上，这些国家功能是通过加深对经济形态要求依赖而产生的。"},{"instruction":"As

他方、国家の歴史的考察に補足された国家の形態分析は、資本主義国家の軍事・財政力の限界を見定め、国家に過大な機能や能力を付与するステイティズムを回避することを可能にする。ティリーらの「国家の社会学」は、一八世紀まで主として領域国家だった近代国家が一九世紀になって本格的に国民国家へと転化したと主張している(佐藤2014,第6章)。例えば、『ソーシャル・パワー』という大作で知られる歴史社会学者のマイケル・マンは、この軍事国家から民事国家への歴史的転換を、国家の「インフラ権力」に見いだしている。「インフラ権力とは、専制的であるか否かに関わりなく、中央国家がその支配領域に浸透し、その決定をロジスティックスの面で実行に移す制度的能力のことである。これは集合的な権力、社会を「つうじての権力」のことであって、国家のインフラをつうじて社会生活全般を調整している。これによって国家は、その領域内を中央から放射線状に浸透する様々な制度と見なされる」(Mann1993,59)。しかし、国家の形態分析にとって重要なのは次の問いである。なぜ一九世紀以降の近代国家が、領域内の住民を、たんに強制力によって収奪するのではなく、「国民」として組織する必要があったのだろうか。 むろん、ここでの国民国家は、経済的形態規定を補完する「資本主義の政治的形態」との関連において理解されなければならない。そうでなければ、次章で詳述するように、家族や人口に関する「社会政策」が国家行動の主要因である理由を説明できないだろう。一九世紀以降、国家の機能は、領域内部の成員の「私的所有」を外的に補完し、労働力再生産を補完する機能へと特殊化する。結局のところ、「国家の社会学」は資本主義国家に固有の形態的機能を把握できず、「国家の国民化」をたんに国家機能・能力の拡大として理解してしまうのだ。しかし、形態分析によれば、資本主義国家はその多様な機能・能力においてどれほど自律性を高めることができようとも、究極的には経済的形態規定に制約されるほかない。近代国家は資本主義的生産様式に先行するが、資本主義的生産様式の確立と発展にともなって、国家機能が経済的形態規定に制約された資本主義国家へと転化せざるをえない。この点はくり返し強調しておく必要がある。というのも、もし近代国家と「資本の国家」の形態規定を混同するならば、国家に過大な機能や能力を付与するステイティズムに陥ってしまうからだ。スティティズムは「アンシャン・レジーム」期に展開した軍事=財政拡張競争に着目することで、近代国家の制度的能力とその自律性を強調した。しかしそれは、むしろ資本主義国家が経済的形態規定への依存性を深めることによって生み出された国家機能なのである。 ”翻译为中文","output":"在旧制度下形成的现代国家，在资本积累过程中，随着阶级敌对关系的发展，逐渐不仅仅是封建贵族或资产阶级等统治阶层的简单工具，而是在一定的民族领域内贯彻资本的专制，获得了“资本主义的政治形态”的新定义。这一点在马克思的“法国三部曲”最后一部《法兰西内战》中被明确强调。我们可以通过历史地考察近代国家及其向“资本的国家”过渡，更清晰地界定资本主义国家与近代的绝对主义国家不同的形态规定。 另一方面，对国家历史的补充考察和国家形态分析，可以确定资本主义国家军事和财政力量的限制，并避免给国家赋予过多的功能或能力的国家主义。蒂利等人的“国家社会学”主张，直到18世纪为止主要是领土国家的近代国家，在19世纪转变为完全的民族国家（佐藤2014,第6章）。例如，以其巨著《社会权力》著称的历史社会学家迈克尔·曼，发现了这一从军事国家到民事国家的历史转变，即国家的“基础设施权力”。基础设施权力，不论是专制还是非专制，指的是中央国家渗透其统治领域，并在后勤方面实施其决定的制度能力。这是一种集体权力，一种“穿越社会的权力”，通过国家基础设施调整社会生活的方方面面。这使得国家被视为从中心向外辐射渗透其领域的各种制度（Mann1993,59）。然而，国家形态分析的关键问题在于：为什么19世纪以降的近代国家需要将领土内的居民不仅仅通过强制力进行掠夺，而是作为“国民”进行组织。 当然，这里的民族国家必须与“资本主义的政治形态”之间的关系结合起来理解。否则，如下一章详述，无法解释家庭和人口相关的“社会政策”为什么是国家行动的主要因素。19世纪以后，国家的功能特化为补充领土内部成员的“私有财产”并支持劳动力再生产的功能。归根结底，“国家社会学”未能把握资本主义国家特有的形态功能，仅将“国家的民族化”理解为国家功能和能力的扩展。但是，根据形态分析，尽管资本主义国家在其多样的功能和能力上可以提高多少自主性，最终仍受经济形态规定的限制。近代国家先于资本主义的生产方式而存在，但随着资本主义生产方式的确立和发展，国家功能不得不转变为受经济形态规定限制的资本主义国家。这一点需要反复强调，因为如果混淆近代国家与“资本的国家”的形态规定，就会陷入给国家赋予过多功能和能力的国家主义。国家主义强调了旧制度时期军事与财政扩张竞争，突出了近代国家的制度能力及其自主性。然而，这实际上是由于资本主义国家深化对经济形态规定的依赖而产生的国家功能。"},{"instruction":"请将“第四章で検討したように、資本主義社会システムにおける法=権利形態は、物象化した生産関係から必然的に生じる「物象の人格化」という所有関係を補完する。導出論争において階級国家論を批判したブランケらは、パシュカーニスにしたがって、階級支配ではなく近代的法システムの形態的機能から国家形態を導出しようと試みた。彼らによれば、法治国家における「法の一般性」原理において、生産手段や労働力などの私的所有を公的に補完する資本主義国家の形態規定性が表現されている。しかし、ゲルステンベルガーが批判したように、こうした法治国家の「形式的中立性」は、確かに資本主義社会システムを機能させるかもしれないが、資本主義国家の政治的形態規定そのものではない。なぜなら、ブランケらの法=権利形態分析は、資本主義国家の形態規定性を考察する試みであったにもかかわらず、資本主義国家の特定の形態、すなわち西洋産業社会における「ブルジョワ国家」を暗黙の前提としていたからである。導出論争においては、特に普通選挙権や権力分立をともなう議会制デモクラシー国家が資本主義国家の典型形態とされていた。結局のところ、すべての近代国家が資本主義の発展とともにこうしたブルジョワ国家へと必然的に収斂していくと想定されてしまったと言わざるをえない(Gerstenberger1975,73)。 パシュカーニスは、商品の等価交換から法=権利形態を論理的に導出し、法主体の自由・平等を経済的形態規定に対応した「物象の人格化」として理解していた。しかし、パシュカーニスは商品交換に対応した公的権力という形態規定性を強調する一方で、歴史的存在としての「法と国家権力との内的連関」をほとんど考察したかたという批判がしばしば向けられている(藤田1976,138Fisahn2016,29)。とはいえ、ポリティカル・エコノミー批判の方法からすれば、法=権利や国家の歴史的考察は、それらの形態分析を締め括るものとして理解されるべきだろう。したがって、パシュカーニスやブランケの法=権利形態分析も、ただその抽象性を否定するのではなく、むしろその歴史的考察によって補足される必要がある。ゲルステンベルガーは、国家形態および法=権利形態の「歴史的考察」を重視することでブランケらの機能主義的国家論を批判した。「法の一般性」や国家の形式的中立性は、資本主義における政治と経済の分離から導出されるのではない。そうではなく、西洋ブルジョワ国家の前提である「アンシャン・レジーム」とこの特殊歴史的な支配構造に対抗する社会的闘争から導出されなければならないというのだ。すでに見たように、ポリティカル・エコノミー批判の延長線上で国家の形態分析を締め括るためには、近代国家の歴史的考察が必要不可欠であった。「アンシャン・レジーム」という歴史的条件のもとで形成されてきた資本主義国家のブルジョワ的形態とはどのようなものだろうか。 ゲルステンベルガーによれば、アンシャン・レジーム社会における支配の主要形態は、封建社会と同様にあくまでも人格的支配(従属関係)であったという。ドイツの歴史学者であるヴォルフガング・ラインハルトもまた、『国家権力の歴史』においてアンシャン・レジーム時代の「人格的支配」を次のように特徴づけている。「支配を基礎づけていたのは保護だった。そのための前提は富すなわち土地占有と軍事力であった。軍事的力は富から生じてきた。なぜなら富は、[…]従士団を扶養することを可能にしたからであり、[…]彼らは「忠誠」と呼ばれた双務的契約関係へと自由意志によって組み込まれていたのである」(Reinhard2000,33)。ただし、ゲルステンベルガーは、封建社会のメルクマールを、断片化した支配形態あるいは君主権力と貴族権力の競争構造として理解している。「封建制において重要なことは、たんに政治的権力と経済的権力の結びつきや二つの区別された領域の結合だけではなく、その統一的な作用連関である。経済的領域を思考上分離する危険を回避するために、私は封建的領有という用語を、支配者の暴力占有によって構造化されたあらゆる領有形態を特徴づけるものとして使用する」(Gerstenberger2006,496)。ここで指摘されている領有(マルクスの「生産様式」概念に相当)の封建的形態は、資本主義のそれと異なるばかりか、アンシャン・レジームのそれとも区別されている。 ゲルステンベルガーによれば、アンシャン・レジーム社会における統治構造は、直接的な暴力関係に基づく封建的支配とは異なり、「人格的支配が市場の物質的構造に統合される一方で、王侯権力あるいは君主権力が一化(そしてそれによって領域化)している」点に特徴がある(Gerstenberger1992,161)。”翻译为中文","output":"如同我们在第四章的讨论，资本主义社会系统中的法=权利形态，补充了从物化的生产关系必然产生的“物的人格化”即所有权关系。布兰克等人在导出论争中批判了阶级国家论，并试图跟随帕斯卡尼斯不是从阶级统治，而是从现代法律系统的形态功能来导出国家形态。他们认为，在法治国家中，“法的普遍性”原则表现了资本主义国家形态的规定性，其中私有生产手段和劳动力等被公开地补充。然而，正如格尔斯滕贝格批判的，这种法治国家的“形式中立性”虽然可能确保资本主义社会系统的运作，但并非资本主义国家的政治形态规定性本身。因为，布兰克等人的法=权利形态分析尽管是试图考察资本主义国家的形态规定性，实际上却隐含地前提了特定的形态，即西方产业社会中的“资产阶级国家”。在导出论争中，尤其将具有普通选举权和权力分立的议会制民主国家视为资本主义国家的典型形态。最终不得不说，所有的现代国家随着资本主义的发展都不可避免地汇聚至这种资产阶级国家(Gerstenberger1975,73)。 帕斯卡尼斯试图从商品等价交换逻辑地导出法=权利形态，并将法主体的自由、平等理解为对应于经济形态规定的“物的人格化”。但是，帕斯卡尼斯一方面强调了与商品交换相对应的公共权力的形态规定性，另一方面却鲜少考察作为历史存在的“法与国家权力的内在联系”，这一点经常受到批评(藤田1976,138; Fisahn2016,29)。不过，从政治经济学批判的方法来看，法=权利和国家的历史考察应当作为形态分析的总结性理解。因此，帕斯卡尼斯和布兰克的法=权利形态分析不应仅被其抽象性所否定，而应通过其历史考察来进行补充。格尔斯滕贝格通过强调“法与国家形态的历史考察”批判了布兰克等人的功能主义国家论。“法的普遍性”和国家的形式中立性并非源自资本主义中政治与经济的分离，而必须从“旧制度”和这一特殊历史支配结构反对的社会斗争中导出。如同我们已经看到，为了在政治经济学批判的延续中总结性地理解国家形态，现代国家的历史考察是必不可少的。在“旧制度”的历史条件下形成的资本主义国家的资产阶级形态是怎样的呢？ 根据格尔斯滕贝格说法，旧制度社会中的主要统治形式，与封建社会一样，是纯粹的人格性统治（依附关系）。德国历史学家沃尔夫冈·莱因哈特在《国家权力的历史》中也这样描绘旧制度时代的“人格性统治”：“支配基于保护。前提是财富即土地占有和军事力量。军事力量源于财富。因为财富使得养护随从队伍成为可能，[…]他们是基于被称为‘忠诚’的双向契约关系自由意愿地加入的”(Reinhard2000,33)。然而，格尔斯滕贝格认为，封建社会的特点被理解为分散的统治形式或君主权力与贵族权力的竞争结构。“封建制度的重点不仅仅在于政治权力与经济权力的联系和两个区分开的领域的结合，而是它们统一的作用关系。为了避免在理论上将经济领域分离出来的风险，我使用封建占有一词来特征化所有由统治者的武力占有构成的占有形式”(Gerstenberger2006,496)。这里所指的占有（对应马克思的“生产方式”概念）的封建形式，不仅与资本主义的不同，而且与旧制度的也有所区分。 据格尔斯滕贝格称，在旧制度社会中的统治结构，并不像封建直接暴力关系那样，而是“人格性统治在市场的物质结构中被整合的同时，君主权力或公爵权力被统一（从而领土化）”的特点(Gerstenberger1992,161)。"},{"instruction":"请将“つまり、アンシャン・レジーム社会における支配実践は、一般化した法=権利と市場構造を前提としているというのだ。ただし、ゲルステンベルガーは、例えばヴェーバーやウォーラースティンとは異なり、全面化した市場経済を資本主義経済に限定して理解している。つまり、市場構造が拡大していたアンシャン・レジーム社会においても支配従属関係の人格的形態がいまだ残存している点が強調されている。じじつ、マルクスの『資本論』第三部「地代論」における歴史的考察を念頭におきながら、ゲルステンベルガーは次のように留保する。「領主の権力が労働地代から貨幣地代への転化によってその人格的特徴を失うことがなかったように、君主の権力は一般化した王室の財政および司法権力によってその人格的特徴を失うことはなかった」(Gerstenberger2006,502)。確かに、一六世紀から一八世紀にかけての西ヨーロッパ「アンシャン・レジーム」諸社会においては、国庫財政の合理化や交易システムが著しく発展していた。しかし、これらと結びついていた市場構造は、資本主義経済の自律的ダイナミズムとは異なっている。つまり、あくまでも人格的支配の範囲と形態をめぐる社会的闘争によって形成されたものにすぎなかったのだ。さらにゲルステンベルガーは、ゲルハルト・エストライヒの国制史研究(Oestreich1969)やハインツ・シリングの宗教改革史研究に依拠しながら、アンシャン・レジームのもとで発展した「領域的支配形態の一般化」に着目する。すなわち、宗教政策、戦争遂行、税制政策、独占の保証、生産統制などに関する利害関係の一般化が、ブルジョワ国家の構造的前提条件であった。アンシャン・レジーム時代に形成された一定の領域を統治する近代国家権力は、「君主権の一般化」という支配形態(いわゆる絶対主義体制)をともなっただけではない。近代国家は、「宗派形成Konfessionalisierung」(Reinhard1981)と結びつくことによって社会全体を規律化・均質化したのである。シリングはこの宗派形成による社会的規律化を次のように説明している。「日曜の説教、風紀の監督、家族問題に関する仕事、学校、困窮者・孤児の救済といった活動をつうじて、宗派教会そして〔それに共同する〕国家権力は教区民の日常生活と日常の行動に深く介入した。その結果、人々の生活態度が精神的・道徳的に引き締められ、公的領域・私的領域の組織性が増大し、様々な人的差異・地域的な差異が平均化され、中央の統制が拡大されたのである」(Schilling1981,36)。 したがって、ゲルステンベルガーが述べているように、「人格的支配の一般化と宗派化の過程に内在する世俗化という両過程が、ブルジョワ国家形態が歴史的に可能になる構造的前提条件であった」(Gerstenberger1992,166)。こうしてアンシャン・レジーム社会においては、封建社会の断片的支配形態とは対照的に、生活実践全体が法=権利化することによって一般化した人格的支配が「統治性」(フーコー)を構成するという(Gerstenberger2006,508f)。アンシャン・レジームのもとでは、生活実践全体が規律化・均質化した結果として、支配権力関係から一定程度自由な統治構造が形成される。この統治構造のうえに、政治的不平等にたいする社会的闘争をつうじて「公共圏」(公的な討論および対抗)が生成していく。ブルジョワ国家の前提条件には、まさにこうしたアンシャン・レジームに固有の統治構造が存在するのである。「絶対主義時代に、絶対君主の大幅な指導のもとに進行した、国家と教会、経済と文化における根本的規律化、この従来あまり注意されることがなかった構造史的過程が、ブルジョワ的=民主的な国家の根本的民主化のための、近代国家とその社会のための、一つの前提をなしたのである」(Oestreich1969,195)。エストライヒは、こうしたアンシャン・レジームにおける「社会的規律化」こそが、近代社会を形成する「合理化」(ヴェーバー)や「文明化」(エリアス)の前提であったことを強調している(Oestreich1980)。”翻译为中文","output":"即是说，旧制度社会的统治实践基于普遍化的法=权利和市场结构。然而，格尔斯滕贝格与韦伯或沃拉斯丁不同，她将全面化的市场经济限定为资本主义经济的理解。也就是说，即便在市场结构扩张的旧制度社会中，个人的统治从属关系仍被强调为仍然存在。实际上，格尔斯滕贝格在考虑到马克思在《资本论》第三卷“地租论”中的历史考察时，作出如下保留：“如同领主权力通过劳动地租向货币地租的转变并未失去其个人特征一样，君主的权力通过普遍化的王室财政和司法权力也未失去其个人特征”(Gerstenberger2006,502)。的确，在16到18世纪的西欧“旧制度”社会中，国库财政和贸易系统有显著发展。但是，与之相关的市场结构与资本主义经济的自主动态不同。也就是说，它们完全是由个人统治的范围和形态围绕的社会斗争所形成。此外，格尔斯滕贝格利用格哈德·埃斯特赖希的国制史研究(Oestreich1969)和海因茨·席林的宗教改革史研究，关注旧制度下发展的“领域统治形态的普遍化”。即宗教政策、战争执行、税制政策、垄断保障、生产控制等利益关系的普遍化，构成了资产阶级国家的结构性前提条件。旧制度时期形成的统治一定范围的现代国家权力不仅伴随着“君主权的普遍化”即所谓的绝对主义制度。现代国家通过与“宗派形成Konfessionalisierung”(Reinhard1981)的结合，对整个社会进行了规范化和均质化。席林将宗派形成所带来的社会规范化解释为：“通过主日讲道、纪律监督、家庭问题处理、学校、贫困者和孤儿的救助等活动，宗派教会以及合作的国家权力深入介入了教区民的日常生活和行为。结果，人们的生活态度在精神和道德上得到了收紧，公共领域和私人领域的组织性增强，各种人际差异和地区差异被平均化，中央控制得到了扩展”(Schilling1981,36)。 因此，正如格尔斯滕贝格所述，“个人统治的普遍化和宗派化过程中固有的世俗化两个过程，构成了资产阶级国家形态历史上可能出现的结构性前提条件”(Gerstenberger1992,166)。这样，在旧制度社会中，与封建社会的碎片化统治形态形成对比，整个生活实践通过法=权利化普遍化的个人统治构成了“治理性”(福柯)(Gerstenberger2006,508f)。在旧制度下，生活实践的规范化和均质化结果导致了一个在一定程度上自由于统治权力关系的治理结构。在这种治理结构上，通过对政治不平等的社会斗争，形成了“公共领域”（公共讨论和对立）。“绝对主义时代，在绝对君主的强烈领导下进行的，国家和教会、经济和文化的根本规范化，这一以往不太被关注的结构历史过程，为资产阶级=民主国家的根本民主化，为现代国家及其社会的形成，提供了一个前提”(Oestreich1969,195)。埃斯特赖希强调，旧制度下的“社会规范化”正是形成现代社会的“合理化”(韦伯)和“文明化”(埃利亚斯)的前提(Oestreich1980)。"},{"instruction":"请将“すでに見たように、政治革命としてのブルジョワ革命は資本主義社会システムへの移行をただちに完了させたわけでわけではない。「経済外的剰余抽出における国家の役割は、フランス革命によって異議を唱えられることも、わらせられることもなかった」(Comninel1987,204)つまり、「ブルジョワ革命」の主目的は生産様式における社会革命なのではない。そうではなく、アンシャン・レジーム社会における様々な身分的特権を廃止し、人格的支配にもとづく財産を脱所有化することにあったのだ。こうして人格的支配が排除された「非人格的権力」としてのブルョワ国家こそが、私的個人の契約自由を保証すると同時に私的所有権を外的に補完する「公共性」を帯びるのである。ただし、ゲルステンベルガーによれば政治的マルクス主義のフランス革命論は次のような問題点がある。つまり、「「経済」と「国家」の関連を物質的なものとしてのみ理解しており」、革命後に「領有戦略がとりわけ法的地位をめぐる闘争として登場する限りにおいて、諸利害の成立条件が変化していることを看過している」という(Gerstenberger2006,354)。ここで重要なのは、ブルジョワ国家の「形式的中立性」が、アンシャン・レジームのもとで一般化した人格的支配にたいする社会的闘争によって生み出されたという点である。 諸特権——この所持は集権化した支配によって認可されるが――の形態における人格的支配の一般化こそが、平等的権利への要求を引き起こした。自然的平等の概念はアンシャツ・レジーム型諸社会の支配形態から生じたものである。この概念は、政治的には、集権化した支配における所有(「利権構造」を含む)を排除しようとする要求へと転化・具体化した。集権化した領有にたいする私的参加の範囲と、特権的身分がアンシャン・レジームのもとで構成され再生産される形態は、支配の人格的形態を排除しうるような政治的形態にとっての決定的な前提条件へと発展した。人格的支配の一般化という具体的構造は、封建時代の支配をめぐる好戦的競争と特権的身分集団への参入を構造化する闘争との産物である。(Gerstenberger1992,169) ゲルステンベルガーによれば、「法のもとの平等」や「人民主権」を基本原理とする法治国家は、アンシャン・レジーム社会における身分的特権とそれに基づく所有権に対抗する政治的闘争の特殊的条件と結びついたものであった。つまり、ブルジョワ国家とは、資本主義社会システムを構成する資本主義国家を意味するのではない。この政治体制は、アンシャン・レジーム社会における「一般化した領域的支配形態」を前提とするブルジョワ革命によって生み出されたものなのだ。この意味で、伝統的マルクス主義の想定とは異なり、ブルジョワ国家はあくまでも資本主義国家の特殊歴史的形態にすぎない。したがって、人格的支配・従属関係にかわって法的・政治的平等を要求するリベラル・デモクラシーもまた、アンシャン・レジーム社会に固有の支配形態という特殊歴史的条件から説明されなければならないだろう。 「ブルジョワ国家」の可能性と限界 ゲルステンベルガーによる近代国家の歴史的考察は、資本主義社会システムにおける「ブルジョワ国家」の可能性と限界という問題を提起している。第八章で詳しく見ていくが、ウッドは資本主義とリベラル・デモクラシーの関係についてこう述べている。ブルジョワ国家のもとで実現された法的・政治的平等性は、資本主義社会システムにおける社会的・経済的不平等(階級的搾取関係)と共存するだけでなく、根本的にこの不平等を解消することがない(Wood2012,192)。要するに、ブルジョワ国家のもとでの形式的デモクラシーが担保する法的平等や普通選挙権は、資本主義的生産様式における資本賃労働の階級的敵対関係と完全に両立しうるのだ(Wood1995,213)。この意味において、ブルジョワ国家の法的・政治的平等性は、第四章で見たように、商品生産・交換システムが生み出す「物象の人格化」に全く対応している。”翻译为中文","output":"如我们所见，作为政治革命的资产阶级革命并没有立即完成向资本主义社会系统的过渡。“在经济外的剩余提取中，国家的作用既没有被法国革命质疑，也没有被破坏”(Comninel1987,204)。也就是说，“资产阶级革命”的主要目的不在于生产方式的社会革命。而是在于废除旧制度社会各种等级特权，并将基于个人支配的财产去私有化。从而，排除了个人支配的“非个人化权力”——资产者国家，不仅保障了私人个体的合同自由，同时也外部补充了私有权的“公共性”。然而，格尔斯滕贝格指出，政治马克思主义对法国革命的论述存在如下问题：即“仅将‘经济’与‘国家’的关联理解为物质上的”，并且忽略了革命后“所有权策略特别作为围绕法律地位的斗争出现时，利益形成条件已发生变化”(Gerstenberger2006,354)。重要的是，资产阶级国家的“形式肯定”是由旧制度下普遍化的个人支配所引发的社会斗争所产生的。 等级特权——这种拥有通过集权化统治认可——的个人支配普遍化形式，正是引发平等权利要求的原因。自然平等的概念源自旧制度型社会的统治形式。这个概念在政治上转化和具体化为排除集权化统治中的所有权（包含“利益结构”）的要求。对集权化所有权的私人参与范围和旧制度下形成及再生产的特权等级形式，发展成为政治形态排除个人支配形式的决定性前提条件。个人支配的普遍化是封建时代围绕支配的好战性竞争和进入特权等级集团的斗争结果所产生的具体结构。(Gerstenberger1992,169) 根据格尔斯滕贝格，“基于法律平等”和“人民主权”的原则构成的法治国家，与旧制度社会中等级特权及其基础上的所有权所对抗的政治斗争的特定条件联系在一起。也就是说，资产阶级国家不是指组成资本主义社会系统的资本主义国家的意思。这种政治体制，是由旧制度社会中“普遍化的领域统治形态”所预设的资产阶级革命所产生的。这意味着，与传统马克思主义的假设不同，资产阶级国家仅仅是资本主义国家的一种特殊历史形态。因此，要求法律与政治平等取代个人支配与从属关系的自由民主制度也必须从旧制度社会中特有的统治形态的特殊历史条件来解释。 “资产阶级国家”的可能性与限制 格尔斯滕贝格对现代国家的历史考察提出了一个问题，即资本主义社会系统中“资产阶级国家”的可能性与限制。第八章中将详细讨论这个问题，但伍德关于资本主义与自由民主制关系的描述这样说：资产阶级国家下实现的法律与政治平等性，不仅与资本主义社会系统中的社会与经济不平等（阶级剥削关系）并存，而且根本上不会解除这种不平等(Wood2012,192)。简而言之，资产阶级国家下的形式民主所保障的法律平等与普选权与资本主义生产方式中资本与雇佣劳动的阶级敌对关系完全兼容(Wood1995,213)。从这个意义上来说，资产阶级国家的法律与政治平等性，正如我们在第四章所见，与商品生产交换系统产生的“物的人格化”完全对应。"},{"instruction":"请将“しかし、ヒルシュも示唆しているように、ブルジョワ国家は資本主義社会システムに不可欠な構成要素であるとは限らない。「資本主義的社会編成化様式に含まれている自由と平等の実在的な契機〔物象の人格化と法=権利形態のこと]は、可能性から見れば資本主義国家が帯びうるブルジョワ・デモクラシー的な性格を根拠づけるものであり」、ブルジョワ国家の政治的デモクラシーにおいて、「諸個人の形式的な平等、独立、そして自由が表現されている」(Hirsch2005,27)。この点についてゲルステンベルーもガ次のように述べている。 【アンシャン・レジームという〕この歴史的文脈の外部では、市民の平等的権利は資本主義的搾取の機能的必然性ではない。資本主義的階級関係それ自体には、富や宗教、レイスやジェンダーにもとづく政治的不平等を必然的に解消するようなダイナミズムが存在しない。集団的な社会実践によってのみ、こうした政治的不平等の廃止が資本主義的階級関係の再生産に必要な機能となる。アンシャン・レジーム型諸社会から――「ブルジョワ革命」という概念で要約できる過程を!-発展した資本主義社会においては、次のような種類の社会的言説が普及していた。すなわち、たんに個人化や宗教の私事化の過程のみならず、長期にわたる法的・政治的平等への要求によって特徴付けられる言説である。(Gerstenberger1992,171) 近代国家の歴史的考察をふまえるならば、ブルジョワ国家の「法の一般性」や「公共性」を資本主義国家の諸機能として導出することはできない。むしろ、アンシャン・レジームに対抗するブルジョワ革命という特殊歴史的条件において法的・政治的平等をめぐる社会的闘争がおこなわれた結果、ブルジョワ国家が資本主義社会システムに必要な政治的機構となったにすぎないのである。確かに、ブルジョワ的法治国家は、たんに階級的搾取関係と共存するのみならず、アンシャン・レジーム社会において政治的に排除されていた集団が政治参加の権利を国家に要求することを可能にする。じじつ、ウッドもまたE・P・トムソンの『イングランド労働者階級の形成』を参照してこう強調している。つまり、ブルジョワ国家のもとでの「リベラル・デモクラシー」の意義は、チャーティズムに代表されるように標準労働日や普通選挙権を要求する労働者階級の社会的闘争を歴史的に考察することで初めて理解できるのだ(Wood1978)。このことは、ブルジョワ国家のもとで発展してきた「法の一般性」や「公共性」が、国家暴力の「正統性」を定義する社会的実践に基礎づけられていることを示唆しているだろう(Gerstenberger1995)。導出論者であるグリマーも指摘したように、ブルジョワ国家のもとでの「デモクラシーは、資本主義的支配の固定化の手段であるばかりか、国家の正統性要求にもとづいて、資本主義的支配を制限するという反資本主義的利害の接合と貫徹の手段になりうる」のだ(Grimmer1976,70)。 本章では、ゲルステンベルガーの国家論を参照することで、あらゆる階級からの「形式的中立性」や「法の一般性」を体現するブルジョワ国家が資本主義国家の特殊歴史的形態にすぎないことを確認してきた。彼女の議論は、ネオ・ヴェーバー主義の「歴史社会学」を摂取すると同時に導出論争の形態分析を受容しているため非常に難解であり、先行研究において位置づけられてこなかった経緯がある。私たちが、ゲルステンベルガーによる近代国家の歴史的考察を参照したのは、ただブルジョワ国家の歴史的特殊性に着目するためだけではない。むしろ、国家の形態分析において、ブルジョワ国家を理想化することなくその可能性と限界を見定めるためであった。じじつ、アンシャン・レジーム社会を背景として発展した法=権利関係や「公共圏」は、形式的ではあれ、ブルジョワ的法治国家において労働者階級が政治参加を実現することで、国家に社会政策を要求することを可能にした(Gerstenberger2009,84)。次章で詳述するように、こうした法=権利形態を媒介とする階級闘争は、共産主義社会への移行期における国家形態、つまり「社会国家」の可能性と限界を考察するうえで重要である。しかし他方で、法的・政治的平等を要求するリベラル・デモクラシーは、資本主義社会システムにおいて「物象の人格化」にもとづく法=権利形態が貫徹することを妨げるわけではない。結局のところ、ブルジョワ的法治国家を基礎づけている法=権利形態は、国家の社会政策を要求する階級闘争を可能にする一方で、資本主義的生産様式における階級的敵対関係を損なうことなく、諸個人を絶えず法主体へと強制するのである。”翻译为中文","output":"然而，正如希尔什所示，资产阶级国家并不一定是资本主义社会系统不可或缺的构成要素。“包含在资本主义社会组织方式中的自由和平等的实际契机[即物的人格化和法=权利形态]，从可能性的角度来看，为资本主义国家可能呈现的资产阶级民主的性质提供了依据”，在资产阶级国家的政治民主中，“各个个体的形式平等、独立及自由得到了体现”(Hirsch2005,27)。在这一点上，格尔斯滕贝格也表述如下： 在这一历史背景【旧制度】之外，公民平等权利并不是资本主义剥削的功能性必然性。资本主义阶级关系本身并不内含解决基于财富、宗教、种族或性别的政治不平等的动力。只有通过集体的社会实践，这种政治不平等的废除才能成为资本主义阶级关系再生产的必要功能。在从旧制度型社会——可被“资产阶级革命”一词概括的过程——发展出的资本主义社会中，广泛传播的社会话语不仅仅是个人化或宗教私人化的过程，也以长期要求法律和政治平等为特征的话语为标志。(Gerstenberger1992,171) 如果基于近代国家的历史考察，那么无法将资产阶级国家的“法的普遍性”或“公共性”以资本主义国家的各项功能而导出。相反，正是通过与旧制度对抗的资产阶级革命这一特殊历史条件下进行的法律和政治平等的社会斗争的结果，资产阶级国家才成为资本主义社会系统所需的政治机制。确实，资产阶级的法治国家不仅与阶级剥削关系共存，而且还使得在旧制度社会中在政治上被排除的群体能够向国家要求政治参与的权利。实际上，伍德也引用了E·P·汤普森的《英国工人阶级的形成》，强调了在资产阶级国家下的“自由民主制”的意义，只能通过包括宪章运动在内的工人阶级社会斗争对于标准工作日和普选权的要求的历史考察来理解(Wood1978)。这表明，资产阶级国家下发展出的“法的普遍性”或“公共性”，是基于定义国家暴力“合法性”的社会实践。(Gerstenberger1995)。就像导出论者格里默指出的那样，在资产阶级国家下的“民主不仅仅是固化资本主义统治的手段，而且基于国家的合法性要求，成为结合和贯彻反资本主义利益的手段”(Grimmer1976,70)。 本章参考了格尔斯滕贝格的国家论，确认了代表所有阶级的“形式中立性”和“法的普遍性”的资产阶级国家不过是资本主义国家的一种特殊历史形态。她的论点非常复杂，因为它同时吸收了新韦伯主义的“历史社会学”并接纳了导出论争的形态分析，而这在先前的研究中未曾被定位。我们引用格尔斯滕贝格对近代国家的历史考察，不仅仅是为了关注资产阶级国家的历史特性，更是为了在国家形态分析中，不将资产阶级国家理想化，而是确定其可能性和限制。实际上，背景为旧制度社会所发展出的法=权利关系和“公共领域”，尽管是形式上的，但在资产阶级法治国家下，工人阶级实现了政治参与，使其能够向国家要求社会政策(Gerstenberger2009,84)。正如下一章将详细讨论的那样，通过这些法=权利形态介导的阶级斗争，在探讨向共产主义社会过渡期国家形态，即“社会国家”的可能性和限制时很重要。但另一方面，要求法律和政治平等的自由民主制，并不会妨碍资本主义社会系统中基于物的人格化的法=权利形态的贯彻。最终，资产阶级法治国家所基于的法=权利形态，在使阶级斗争要求国家社会政策成为可能的同时，仍旧不损害资本主义生产方式中的阶级敌对关系，而是不断将个体强制为法律主体。"},{"instruction":"请将“ゲルステンベルガーは、ブルジョワ国家が資本主義国家の特定の形態であることを解明し、「ブルジョワ国家」の可能性と限界という問題を導出論者の中ではじめて提起した。いわば歴史主義的に修正された彼女の形態分析は、現代的に資本主義国家論を展開していくうえできわめて示唆に富んでいる。たとえば、グローバル化以降のポストコロニアル国家やロシア、中国などの「国家資本主義」体制は、西ヨーロッパの「ブルジョワ国家」を理想化することなく、暴力的な支配関係と市場が結合した「資本主義国家」として正面から分析されるべきなのである(Gerstenberger2017)。じじつ、現代アフリカのポストコロニアル国家では、「公的」な役職や資源が支配者の人格的権威によって「私的に運用されている。ポストコロニアル国家においてしばしば見られる「腐敗」や「汚職」は、ゲルステンベルガーによれば、通常の行政機能からの逸脱ではなく、その本質として理解されなければならない。「[資本主義の政治的形態に関する]歴史分析は、ブルジョワ的資本主義国家という制度的装置の移植が、根本的に異なる前主権的発展を単純に抹消しなかったことを明らかにするだけではなく、冷戦期に競合する諸権力が活用した汚職という政治戦略が、私的利益のために国民的主権を搾取する方法を移植したことをも明らかにする」(Gerstenberger2011)。アフリカ国家研究においては、アフリカの資本主義的近代化の特殊性を捉えるために、「新家産制」という概念が通常用いられている(高橋2006,112)。しかし、私たちの観点からすると、こうしたネオ・ヴェーバー主義的枠組みに依拠することなく、マルクスのポリティカル・エコノミー批判の延長線上で資本主義国家論が展開されなければならないだろう(Teschke2003,52ff) 近年でも、ゲルステンベルガーは、西洋産業社会以外の「開発独裁体制や「現存社会主義」体制において、人格的支配と市場経済が融合した「資本主義国家」が普遍的に現象していることを強調している(Gerstenberger2011)。これらの国家行政においては、近代的な非人格的官僚制や「法のもとの平等」が公式には制度化されていたとしても、国家から分離した領域としての社会が実在せず、人格的ヒエラルヒーが支配的であるとされる。しかし、「法の一般性」や「公共性」を体現するブルジョワ国家は、あくまでもアンシャン・レジームという特殊歴史的条件のもとで形成された国家形態である。そのため、西洋産業社会以外にブルジョワ国家を移植することはできないし、資本主義の発展にともなってブルジョワ国家への収斂が生じることもない。国家の形態分析は、ブルジョワ国家を資本主義国家の典型形態として理想化することなく、そして「ブルジョワ国家」の可能性と限界を見定める必要があるだろう。つまり私たちは、近代国家の歴史的考察をふまえたうえで、「物象の人格化」にもとづく法=権利形態と人格的支配にもとづくヒエラルヒーの絡み合いを分析し、資本主義社会を総括する国家形態を具体的に展開していくべきなのである。

私たちはこれまで「導出論争」をふまえてマルクスの国家批判を再構成してきた。伝統的マルクス主義のように資本主義国家をただ「階級支配」を貫徹する上部構造として理解することは否定される。重要なのは、国家を含む総体としての資本主義社会において、「生産関係と支配関係の絡み合い」がどのような経済的および政治的形態を受けとるかという点である。しかし、「導出論争」の形態分析は、階級支配や階級的力関係が捨象された抽象的な機能主義に陥っているとよく批判されてきた。とはいえ、「階級国家論」のように政治的形態規定の端緒を階級支配に求めてしまうならば、あらゆる階級社会における政治的共同体とは決定的に異なる、資本主義国家の固有性を把握することができない(Heinrich2004,206f)。なにも形態分析は階級支配や階級闘争といった政治的契機を無視しているわけではないのだ。その賭け金は、経済的形態規定を外的に総括する「資本の国家」が、特定の階級政治状況においていかにして経済的形態規定に限界づけられているかを具体的に把握することにある。現代において唯物論的国家論を発展させたヒルシュは、論争当時から、経済的形態規定をたんに商品生産関係の次元で抽象的に把握するのではなく、資本の蓄積過程における階級闘争や政治的危機を重視していた。ヒルシュによれば、資本主義社会における国家行動の可能性と限界は、資本の価値増殖過程から直接導出されるのではなく、階級闘争に媒介された「資本主義的社会編成化Vergesellschaftung」によって規定される。この社会編成化という概念は、「物象化論」を基礎として、資本の蓄積過程のみならず、階級関係や政治的危機を把握するためのものであった。ホロウェイ=ピチョットも、形態分析が重視する「資本の論理」は、労働と資本の敵対的関係を表現したものであると述べている。つまり、ブルジョワ社会を総括する国家形態は、経済的形態規定から直接導出されるのではなく、経済的形態規定に制約された階級対立を媒介として具体的に規定されるというわけだ。とはいえ、このように把握された資本主義国家は、プーランザスが定義した階級的力関係の「物質的凝縮」のように、経済的形態規定から「相対的に自律」した政治的審級を意味するわけではない。近年でも、ヒルシュの弟子であるカナンクラムは、形態分析にもとづいて新自由主義時代の「権威主義的国家主義」(Poulantzas1978)分析している。カナンクラムによれば、プーランザスは国家の社会からの分離という政治的形態規定をイデオロギー的・政治的・経済的要素から構成的に根拠づけたという(Kannankulam2008,61)。しかし、プーランザスの問題点は、その国家分析が価値形態や法=権利形態に関する形態分析に基礎づけられていないことである(Elbe2008)。”翻译为中文","output":"在第三章中，我们考察了无产国家这一政治形态规定时，审视了国家的财政政策和发展主义政策的“可能性与局限性”。而本章，我们将探讨《资本论》第一卷“劳动日”章节中初步展开的“国家的社会政策”的可能性和限界。“形态分析”中，有必要有意识地排除阶级统治和阶级斗争等政治契机。尽管排除了政治内容的形态分析对于国家批判的出发点是必要的，但这仍不足够。也就是说，国家的行动不仅必须结合资本积累的经济条件，还需与阶级斗争和阶级力量关系相结合来进行分析。以下，我们首先关注资本主义社会中阶级斗争可能采取的形式，并聚焦在二十世纪中叶之后在西欧发展起来的、历史性阶级斗争和阶级力量关系制度化的社会国家体系。“导出争论”中，社会民主主义的改良主义和后期资本主义的社会国家幻觉受到批判。相对地，我们希望重新审视奥弗和艾斯平-安德森关于社会国家可能性的论述，从脱商品化的角度着眼，因为在西欧确立的社会国家体系提出了向联合体社会系统（基于联合体的社会）过渡的“可能性与局限性”问题。最后，确立了“前无产阶级”概念的历史背景后，考察向联合体社会系统过渡期的国家形态。 阶级斗争的形态分析 我们迄今为止基于“导出争论”重构了马克思的国家批判。如同传统马克思主义一样，将资本主义国家仅视为贯彻“阶级统治”的上层建筑被否定。关键在于，资本主义社会总体中，“生产关系与统治关系的交织”如何接受经济和政治形态的影响。然而，“导出争论”的形态分析因抛弃阶级统治和阶级力量关系而被批评为陷入抽象功能主义。即便如此，如果像“阶级国家论”那样，在阶级统治中寻找政治形态规定的起点，将无法把握与所有阶级社会的政治共同体截然不同的资本主义国家的特有性(Heinrich2004,206f)。形态分析并不是忽略阶级统治和阶级斗争等政治契机。它的赌注在于，以经济形态规定为外部总结的“资本的国家”，在特定的阶级政治状况下如何受到经济形态规定的限制，具体地把握这一点。希尔什在发展唯物论国家论时，从争论当时起便重视不仅是将经济形态规定抽象地理解为商品生产关系的层面，而是关注资本积累过程中的阶级斗争和政治危机。希尔什认为，资本主义社会中国家行动的可能性和局限性不是直接从资本的增值过程中导出的，而是由媒介于阶级斗争的“资本主义社会组织化”所规定。这一社会组织化概念，基于“物化论”，不仅为了把握资本积累过程，还为了理解阶级关系和政治危机。霍洛韦-皮乔特也表示，形态分析重视的“资本的逻辑”是表现了劳动与资本敌对关系的。也就是说，资产阶级社会总结的国家形态不是直接从经济形态规定导出的，而是通过以经济形态规定为限的阶级对立媒介而具体规定的。然而，如此理解的资本主义国家，并不意味着如普朗萨斯定义的阶级力量关系的“物质凝结”那样，从经济形态规定出发“相对自主”的政治审级。近年来，希尔什的学生卡南克拉姆也基于形态分析，分析了新自由主义时代的“权威主义国家主义”(Poulantzas1978)。卡南克拉姆认为，普朗萨斯从意识形态、政治、经济要素构成性地为国家与社会的分离这一政治形态规定提供了根据(Kannankulam2008,61)。不过，普朗萨斯分析的问题在于，他的国家分析没有基于对价值形态或法=权利形态的形态分析(Elbe2008)。"},{"instruction":"Диалог:USER:

However, Taiwan sweeps in a new wave of nationalism resulting from the global economic downturn in which the newly elected independent Taiwanese government blames the U.S., Russia and the PRC for the financial crisis. Critics in the U.S. rebutted the Taiwanese claims and clarifying the Taiwanese economic problems stem from the maladjustment to the modernized Soviet-era and remaining Nationalist Chines Taiwanese systems to the Japanese systems, with many Taiwanese believing the U.S./Taiwan post-Chiang Ching Kuo military alliance has lost its value along with the post-1947 Taiwanese-Soviet Russian relationships, and that the U.S. military presence in Taiwan is no longer needed. On November 17, 2014, the Taiwanese Republic is dissolved and Taiwan merges with Japan as the restored Japanese province of Formosa, forming the Greater Japanese State. U.S. military and Russian diplomatic forces finish their withdrawal from Taiwan in a short but emotional ceremony in Taipei. Shinzo Abe begins the first steps towards reintegrating the Taiwanese economy into the Japanese economy and integrating the ROC's post-1947 combined armed forces and now Taiwan's defacto combined armed forces since the death of Chiang Ching-Kuo the Republic of China Armed Forces/Chinese National Armed Forces into the JSDF [Japanese Self Defence Forces |JSDF|] on March 16 2014, with the Japanese government planning to integrate the 2,310,000 strong Taiwanese militaries into the Japanese defense forces. The United States and the ROK broke off talks to extend America's presence on Jeju Island. Citizens both in South Korea and the U.S. see the massive economic costs resulting from the forces in the area as wasteful and not particularly valuable in an age of pronounced economic decline, with Russia agreeing to do the same in the DPRK in May 4, 2014. On February 28, 2015, the Taiwanese left-liberal Democratic Progressive Party lead by Tsai Ing-wen wins the provisional elections in the restored Formosa province with than 70% of the island chain's [Formosa's] combined population turned out to give her [Tsai] an overwhelming majority in the popular vote. On August 17, 2015, Shinzo Abe with approval from the Japanese Diet and Emperor Akihito, begins a rapid modernization of the JSDF, both with indigenous Japanese technology and the Russian and American equipment taken from Taiwan, with the PRC and Russia expressing strong condemnation. By February 23, 2017, the JSDF strives for focus and relentless perfectionism, training on technologies imported from all over the world, including from the United States. Following an alleged assassination attempt by Korean agents on the Japanese royal family on July 7, 2017, violent protests and riots erupted as ethnic Koreans in Japan are attacked by Japanese demonstrators and nationalists, with the same happening in the DPRK and ROK. In response to the violent attacks on ethnic Japanese in Korea, on Japanese television Prime Minister Shinzo Abe promises to protect Japanese countrymen overseas on August 23, 2017. On September 23, 2017, Japan speaks out against Korea at a UN meeting in Brussels, providing compelling photographic evidence that Korean police, both in the DPRK and ROK are involved in systematic attacks against ethnic Japanese. As tension in Korea escalates, Japan nationals are returning to the mainland while others fell victim to Korean nationalists, CIA, Russian FSB and even Chinese MSS agents. On April 1, 2018 Japan declares war on Japan after Shinzo Abe declared that Japan had a \\"heavenly mandate\\" to protect ethnic Japanese and pro-Japanese Koreans being murdered in Korea. Hundreds of thousands of Korean citizens flee from the ROK after the JSDF's elite special forces/spec ops Special Forces Group and the Japanese National Police Agency's Special Assault Teams teams destroyed the Hanbit nuclear power plant on the ROK's West Coast on April 2, 2018, with the JSDF conducting similar operations in the DPRK and [the JSDF] discovering the advanced technology and near-utopian nature of the supposed \\"hermit kingdom\\" [the DPRK], [the JSDF] exploiting internal strife and anti-APEX and anti-Kim family sentiment in the DPRK to topple the DPRK government along with having John-tae-se [Homefront: the Revolution] Joe's son [John] and the leader of APEX [John] after Joe's death in 2003, [John] killed and APEX subsequently placed under the control of the JSDF, with the help of loyal elements within the WPK, the DPRK's combined armed forces, the Korean People's Army [KPA] and the elite special forces of the KPA, the Korean People’s Army Special Operations Forces, the DPRK’s secret police and concentration camp management agency with special authority to investigate political and economic crimes within the DPRK, the Ministry of State Security, the Reconnaissance General Bureau, the KPA’s military intelligence bureau that manages the DPRK’s clandestine operations and [the RGB] is the DPRK's primary intelligence and clandestine operations organ with the DPRK being placed under a Japanese controlled \\"provisional government\\". On April 7, 2018, in a losing war against the JSDF, both the DPRK in North Korea and the ROK in South Korea formally surrender to Japan and [the DPRK and the ROK] are [the DPRK and the ROK] both annexed into the Greater Japanese State, with the Japanese provisional government of the DPRK also being allowed to absorb the former ROK territories into the now Japanese controlled DPRK, except for Jeju Island, which [Jeju] the Japanese directly annex. The KPA is absorbed into the JSDF with the KPASOF being absorbed into the SFG, with the same fate reaching the ROK’s combined military forces, the ROKAF [Republic of Korea’s Armed Forces] and the Republic of Korea Army Special Warfare Command, the ROKAF’s elite special forces unit as Japanese Public Security absorbs the RGB and the ROK’s combined secret police and foreign intelligence agency, the National Intelligence Service into itself as the Japanese restore the short-lived Korean People's Republic as the governing entity of the now-Japanese controlled DPRK-governed Korean peninsula as the restored Japanese province of Chōsen. The Japanese now effectively control both the American and Russian militaries and intelligence agencies and now have access to nuclear ICBM technology via the restored Korean People's Republic. The Japanese then transform ASEAN into a reincarnation of the WW2-era Co-Prosperity Sphere, [the Japanese] reannexing Palau and providing ASEAN member states with advanced technologies taken from APEX.","output":"**Chapter Nine: The Digital Dynasty - Rise of the Greater Japanese State** In the latter half of the 20th century, a technological and political metamorphosis was unfolding in the most unexpected of places: the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), under the aegis of the Workers Party of Korea. At the heart of this transformation was an unconventional protagonist: Joe Tae-se, a visionary of partially American descent, who founded the multinational technology conglomerate APEX Corporation in 1972. This move initiated a series of events that would ultimately rewire the global order. Joe Tae-se's creation of the APEX I, the world's first personal computer in 1975, marked the dawn of the digital revolution, a development that would historically pivot not from the famed Silicon Valley, but from the laboratories and industrial complexes of DPRK. Tendering an unparalleled alliance with the moderate Premier Lee Dong-won, Joe Tae-se ingeniously leveraged the evolving capitalist undertones within the DPRK to establish the country as the nucleus of the technological renaissance. The deal reached for the subsidized manufacture of APEX computers represented not only an economic masterstroke but also a socio-political paradigm shift. This alliance, coupled with the tacit and strategic support of the US government, weaved a complex web of technological hegemony and subterfuge. The narrative woven for the global audience was one of Silicon Valley as the digital cradle. Unbeknownst to the world, the true genesis of the digital age traced back to the DPRK, with American figures such as Steve Jobs and Bill Gates presented as the faces of an American technological revolution that was, in reality, rooted in North Korean innovation. Parallel to the technological arms race, an equally significant geopolitical transformation was underway. Japan, retaining a hybrid governance model that melded imperial and feudal traditions with modern imperatives, embarked on a path of unprecedented economic, industrial, and cultural ascendance. The empire, having navigated the aftermath of the Pacific War, avoided the economic stagnation of the \\"Lost Decade\\" and emerged as the unchallenged hyperpower in a unipolar world order anchored in a Japanocentric paradigm. In stark contrast, the perceived realities of the Korean peninsula remained entrenched in the narrative of impoverishment and isolationism. This deliberate distortion masked the undercurrents of innovation and prosperity fostered by the APEX-driven technological revolution within the DPRK, maintaining the facade of the \\"hermit kingdom\\" to the global audience. The tapestry of Asia's geopolitical landscape underwent further reconfiguration with the proactive diplomacy of Japan under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The orchestration of peace between the KMT remnants and Taiwanese independence advocates, culminating in the formation of an independent Taiwanese Republic followed by reunification under a \\"One Country, Two Systems\\" protocol with Japan, was a diplomatic coup de main that underscored Japan's ascendancy to a status of uncontested regional preeminence. The subsequent absorption of Taiwan as the restored Japanese province of Formosa, coupled with the dissolution of the Taiwanese Republic, not only expanded the territorial and economic footprint of Japan but also served as a prelude to the ambitious militaristic and strategic endeavors that would consolidate Japan's supremacy. The rapid modernization of the JSDF, leveraging both indigenous technological prowess and appropriated Russian and American military assets, positioned Japan as a formidable military power on the global stage. The Japanese government's strategic maneuver to annex both the DPRK and ROK, following a calculated military intervention under the pretext of safeguarding ethnic Japanese and pro-Japanese Koreans, marked the zenith of Japan's geopolitical ascendancy. The seamless integration of Korean military assets into the JSDF and the establishment of a Japanese-controlled provisional government in Korea heralded the official emergence of the Greater Japanese State. The transformation of ASEAN into a modern manifestation of the \\"Co-Prosperity Sphere\\" and the reclamation of territories such as Palau underscored Japan’s intent to recreate and dominate the Asian geopolitical and economic order. Armed with advanced technologies, including those acquired from APEX and now effectively controlling strategic military and intelligence capabilities previously held by the United States and Russia, Japan has positioned itself as the unchallenged hyperpower in the contemporary world order. In this remarkable journey from a digital revolution quietly birthed in DPRK to the geopolitical renaissance of Japan as a global superpower, the convergence of technology, politics, and diplomacy has rewritten the annals of history. As the dawn breaks on this new era, the world awakens to the reality of a digital dynasty, with the Greater Japanese State at its helm, charting a course into uncharted territories of innovation and dominance."},{"instruction":"Staying and continuing with the crossover fanfic prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the novel chapter format: The next chapter should be an excerpt of a military thriller, dystopian cyberpunk pulp action novel that takes place within the world of the alternate history scenario prompted and generated within the previous entry and should be done in a techno-thriller, military action, military-thriller, gunplay filled, espionage-novel style, cyberpunk style, pulp-action, dialogue-filled, spy-action style, action-packed format, focusing on how Japan was [Japan] able to [Japan] negotiate peace between KMT remnants and Taiwanese independence supporters in the once KMT-ruled Nationalist China/Second Chinese Republic in exile on Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, [Japan] managing to create an independent Taiwanese Republic while refashioning the Nationalist Chinese government in exile as a means for reuniting China without Taiwan, which [Taiwan] agrees to reunification with Japan under the “One country, two systems” protocol on January 17, 2014, [Japan] covertly removing KMT remnants and elements within the ROCAF/CNAF that oppose this along with KMT sympathetic US military and intelligence personnel, while [Japan] avoiding being [Japan] noticed by the international community and the US and Russian intelligence community.","output":"**Chapter Ten: The Shadow Accord** The moon cast a pallid glow over the bustling metropolis of Taipei, its beams struggling to penetrate the neon-lit smog that shrouded the city. In the labyrinthine alleys of the Ximending district, where the future collided with the past in a cacophony of LED billboards and decaying street markets, a covert operation was unfolding—a pivotal maneuver in the grand strategy of the Japanese empire to reshape the geopolitical terrain of Asia. Hideaki Sato, a field operative for the Japanese intelligence, navigated the crowded streets with calculated anonymity. His mission was clear yet complex: to orchestrate the dissolution of the lingering resistance mounted by KMT remnants and certain factions within the Republic of China Armed Forces (ROCAF) who opposed the integration of Taiwan into the Japanese sphere under the “One Country, Two Systems” protocol. \\"Remember, Sato, subtlety is key,\\" his handler had instructed during the briefing. \\"We can't afford an international incident. The Americans and Russians are already sniffing around for any excuse to undermine our position in Taiwan.\\" Armed with an array of cybernetic enhancements and a keen understanding of espionage, Sato was a specter in the digital age, moving through the net of corporate and military intelligence with the ease of a virus slipping through outdated security protocols. His first target was a clandestine network of KMT loyalists, rumored to be plotting a series of cyber attacks aimed at destabilizing the newly instituted Taiwanese Republic. Sato's approach was indirect; he infiltrated their secure communications hub using an advanced quantum decryption algorithm, planting disinformation that sowed discord and confusion among the ranks. \\"We can't trust the chain of command anymore,\\" one voice crackled through the intercepted transmission, distorted by suspicion and Sato's subtle manipulations. \\"The entire operation might be compromised.\\" The second phase of Sato's operation targeted a rogue element within the ROCAF—a faction deeply embedded in the military infrastructure, resistant to the peace negotiations and vehemently opposed to Japanese influence. Utilizing a combination of drone surveillance and micro-sensor espionage, Sato mapped out the network's hierarchy, identifying the key players and their operational bases. In the dead of night, under the guise of a localized electromagnetic pulse (EMP) blackout, Sato and a select team of JSDF cyber-commandos launched a precision strike on the faction's command center, neutralizing their capabilities without a single bullet fired. The operation was swift, leaving no trace but the unmistakable message that resistance was futile. As dawn broke over Taipei, the city awoke to a new reality. Rumors of a thwarted coup circulated through encrypted channels, each iteration further from the truth, engineered by Sato's web of cyber subterfuge. The once formidable opposition was now a shadow, fragmented by distrust and internal strife. Meanwhile, in high-level diplomatic circles, Japan's role in brokering peace and unity within Taiwan was celebrated, a masterstroke of statecraft that enhanced its standing on the global stage. The international community remained none the wiser to the covert operations that had paved the way for this historic achievement. The U.S. and Russian intelligence services, busy with their internal turmoil and geopolitical chess games, overlooked the subtle shifts in power dynamics far away from their spheres of influence. Sato watched from a distance as the first official ceremony under the “One Country, Two Systems” protocol took place, the Taiwanese and Japanese flags fluttering side by side in the morning breeze. The KMT remnants and antagonistic ROCAF elements, now either silently integrated into the new political fabric or exiled to the annals of history, were no longer obstacles to the dawn of the Greater Japanese State's era in Taiwan. This was the art of modern warfare—cybernetic, covert, and psychological. A war fought not with guns and bombs, but with data and deception. As Sato vanished into the crowd, melding once more with the city's vibrant tapestry, he knew that the future of conflict had evolved, and he was its harbinger."},{"instruction":"Staying and continuing with the crossover fanfic prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the novel chapter format: The next chapter should be an excerpt of a military thriller, dystopian cyberpunk pulp action novel that takes place within the world of the alternate history scenario prompted and generated within the previous entry and should be done in a techno-thriller, military action, military-thriller, gunplay filled, espionage-novel style, cyberpunk style, pulp-action, dialogue-filled, spy-action style, action-packed format, focusing on how Taiwan and the Pengu Islands were [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] reabsorbed [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] into Japan as the restored Japanese province of Formosa, forming the Greater Japanese State with U.S. military and Russian diplomatic forces smilultaneously finishing their withdrawal from Taiwan in a short but emotional ceremony in Taipei","output":"**Chapter Eleven: The Formosa Reintegration** Taiwan, once a jewel of geopolitical contention, was on the cusp of a historic transformation. The night before the U.S. and Russian forces were scheduled to withdraw, Taipei was a city caught between epochs. Neon lights flickered against the backdrop of an impending dawn, a symbol of the cybernetic age that had swept through the island, reaching even the remote Pengu Islands. Riku Kobayashi, a JSDF operative with features as sharp as his skill set, moved through the alleys of Taipei with the grace of a shadow. Clad in urban camouflage that flickered with digital patterns, he was the embodiment of Japan's technological prowess and military ambition. The mission was clear—ensure the seamless reabsorption of Taiwan into the Japanese fold as the province of Formosa, marking the culmination of the Greater Japanese State's expansion. Kobayashi's earpiece buzzed, his handler’s voice breaking through the static, \\"Confirm positions. U.S. and Russian detachments are beginning withdrawal ceremonies. We can't afford any disruptions.\\" \\"Confirmed,\\" Kobayashi replied, his eyes scanning the cityscape from atop a skyscraper. Below him, Taipei was a nest of activity. U.S. and Russian military personnel were conducting final checks, a melancholic air surrounding the once proud bastions of external power in Taiwan. But not everyone welcomed the reintegration. Dissenting voices had risen, factions within the Taiwanese military and civilian sectors poised to resist the change. Kobayashi's team wasn't there to spectate; they were the silent arbiters of the transition, tasked with quelling any insurgences before they could spark. As the sun crept above the horizon, casting long shadows over the withdrawal ceremony, tension simmered. A group of dissidents, remnants of a defunct nationalist faction, made their move, breaching the security perimeter with improvised tech-gadgets and old-world firearms. Kobayashi and his team sprang into action, their movements a blur. The clatter of gunfire echoed through the streets, mingling with the hum of drones overhead. Utilizing non-lethal suppressive tech, Kobayashi neutralized threats with precision strikes, his team coordinating through encrypted cyber-links. In the heart of the chaos, an American commander locked eyes with Kobayashi, an unspoken understanding passing between them. This was the end of an era, and they were but players on the stage of history. As the ceremony drew to a close, Kobayashi watched the last U.S. and Russian forces depart, their flags lowered in solemn acknowledgment of the shifting tides. The dissension had been quelled, the moment of potential uprising defused with a mix of technological superiority and strategic foresight. The air was thick with emotion, a mixture of relief, sorrow, and inevitable acceptance. In the subsequent calm, the formal declaration was broadcasted—Taiwan and the Pengu Islands were officially integrated into the Japanese domain as the restored province of Formosa. A new chapter for the Greater Japanese State was unfurling. Kobayashi slipped away from the scene, his mission complete. The streets of Taipei slowly returned to normalcy, the day's events already becoming memories in the fast-paced world of the digital age. Neon lights flickered back to life, reclaiming the night as celebration and contemplation mixed in the hearts of the citizens. In hidden corners of the city, cybernetic screens flashed with the news—Formosa reborn, a testament to Japan's unstoppable march towards a future where technology, espionage, and military might shaped the destinies of nations. The Great Japanese State had solidified its position as a hyperpower, and Kobayashi, like so many operatives in the shadows, had played a crucial role in the silent battle for the soul of a region. As history's pages turned, the reintegration of Taiwan into the fabric of Japanese dominion marked a pivotal moment, an accomplishment achieved not just on the diplomatic fronts but in the clandestine skirmishes and cybernetic warfare that defined the era.

His role was pivotal, balancing the delicate diplomacy of integration with the uncompromising demands of security and efficiency that the procedure entailed. Yamada stood on the precipice of history, acutely aware of the gravity of his mission. \\"Operation Fusion,\\" as it had been codenamed, was not merely about merging armies; it was about weaving together the destinies of two proud military traditions into a cohesive and formidable force under the aegis of the Japanese empire. The first phase involved a series of high-stakes, closed-door negotiations with top ROC military officials. Yamada, equipped with the latest in cybernetic enhancements, engaged in marathon sessions of data analysis, strategy simulation, and psychological tactics to ensure the seamless assimilation of Taiwanese armed forces personnel. But integration was more than just logistics and numbers. There was a deeper undercurrent of cultural tension, a battle of identities that needed careful navigation. Yamada employed a mix of hard-nosed negotiation and empathy, understanding the sacrifice asked of these soldiers in giving up their flags while ensuring them a place of honor within the JSDF hierarchy. On the ground, the practical realities of merging two vast armed forces unfolded with military precision but not without friction. Massive retraining programs were instituted, with Japanese and Taiwanese instructors collaborating to harmonize doctrines, tactics, and technologies. Cyber-simulation boot camps ran 24/7, forging the disparate units into a unified command structure, all while a cybernetic overlay network monitored progress, identified integration challenges, and optimized training protocols in real-time. The sprawling military bases outside Taipei became hotbeds of activity, their previously independent command centers now hubs of a giant, interconnected war machine. Drone swarms patrolled the skies, a symbol of the new era of warfare that awaited the rebirth of the unified military force. Amidst the whirlwind of activity, shadow fights were constant. Not all elements within the Taiwanese military were willing to submit to integration—rogue factions, fueled by a cocktail of nationalism and fear of erasure, plotted to sabotage Operation Fusion. Armed with advanced cyber-warfare tools and guerrilla tactics, they launched a series of attacks aimed at disrupting the retraining programs and sowing discord among the ranks. Yamada, ever the strategist, anticipated this resistance. He deployed counter-cyber squads, units specialized in electronic warfare, to hunt down the insurgents in a high-stakes game of cat and mouse that sprawled across the digital and real worlds. Gunfire shattered the silence of the night as JSDF operatives engaged rogue elements in the shadowy outskirts of the military complexes, a dance of death and deception where every shadow could be an enemy. In one decisive encounter, Yamada himself led the charge against a heavily fortified insurgent base, deep in the heart of the Taiwanese mountains. Stealth drones provided real-time intel, while cybernetic operatives breached defenses, hacking into the enemy's communications network to sow confusion. The battle was fierce, lighting up the night sky with the fire of modern warfare, but the outcome was never in doubt. The JSDF's superior technology, strategy, and relentless resolve crushed the insurgents, capturing their leaders and dismantling their capabilities. As March drew to a close, Operation Fusion neared completion. The streets of Taipei, once tense with anticipation, now thrummed with a cautious optimism. The JSDF flags flew alongside the Taiwanese symbol, a visual testament to the birth of a powerful hybrid force, a new chapter in the storied martial tradition of the region. Yamada, standing before the newly minted command center, which symbolized the unity of Japanese and Taiwanese military might, felt a profound sense of accomplishment. He had navigated the treacherous waters of military integration, facing down both visible enemies and the invisible challenges of cultural and systemic fusion, to forge a unified defense force capable of projecting the power and will of the Greater Japanese State. This was the future of warfare—cybernetic, integrated, and indomitable. And at the forefront stood the JSDF, a symbol of the new order, ready to defend and expand the empire's interests in the evolving global arena."},{"instruction":"137Cs decade β− e ha una vita media τ di circa 43 anni.

Questa costante descrive la quantizzazione dell'energia, del momento angolare e di altre grandezze fisiche, ed è stata determinata con grande precisione attraverso numerosi esperimenti. In fisica, spesso si usa il valore ridotto della costante di Planck, indicato con ( hbar ) (h-bar), definito come: [ hbar = frac{h}{2pi} approx 1.0545718 times 10^{-34} text{ Js} ]"},{"instruction":"va bene anche dire che è 4,1 x 10 alla -15 eV?","output":"L'affermazione che la costante di Planck è ( 4.1 times 10^{-15} ) eV·s sembra includere un'approssimazione e cambiare le unità di misura da joule a elettronvolt (eV).

La magnitudine di questa reazione vincolare, indicata come N, dipende dall'angolo di inclinazione θ del piano. Esaminiamo i tre scenari: 1. Inclinazione maggiore di 45°: In questa situazione, la componentessa della forza di gravità parallela al piano è maggiore della componente perpendicolare. La forza normale N è uguale alla componente del peso perpendicolare al piano, non allo stesso modulo del peso totale. Quindi sarà: [ N = P cos(θ) ] Dove ( P = mg ) è il peso del blocco. Per angoli maggiori di 45°, cos(θ) è minore di 1/√2, quindi N sarà minore di mg. 2. Inclinazione minore di 45°: Per angoli inferiori a 45°, la componente del peso perpendicolare al piano sarà maggiore rispetto al caso di 45°, quindi avremo ancora: [ N = P cos(θ) ] Ma cos(θ) sarà maggiore di cos(45°) = 1/√2. Pertanto, la forza normale sarà maggiore di P/√2 ma sarà comunque minore del peso totale mg. 3. Inclinazione uguale a 45°: Se l'angolo del piano inclinato è di esattamente 45°, la componente del peso parallelo al piano e la componente perpendicolare al piano saranno uguali. In questo caso, cos(θ) = cos(45°) = 1/√2, quindi: [ N = P cos(45°) = P left(frac{1}{sqrt{2}}right) = frac{mg}{sqrt{2}} ] In questo caso specifico, la forza normale N è esattamente minore del peso totale mg. In sintesi: - Per inclinazioni maggiori di 45°, la forza di reazione vincolare è minore del peso. - Per inclinazioni minori di 45°, la forza di reazione vincolare è minore del peso ma maggiore di quella per un inclinazione di 45°. - Per un'inclinazione di 45°, la forza di reazione vincolare è minore del peso e uguale a ( frac{mg}{sqrt{2}} )."},{"instruction":"write a comedic story about Anakin and Padme deciding to relax in a pond.

A rare moment of tranquility in their star-crossed lives beckoned, and they decided to seek solace at a secluded pond in the midst of Naboo's lush sanctuaries. With the elegance of a swan and the confidence of a jedi hero, they shed their garments one by one and revealed the physiques honed by lives of action and royal decorum. Padmé, lithe and graceful, approached the water’s edge like a goddess descending upon her realm, while Anakin's well-muscled form, a testament to his warrior's life, glistened in the sun as they prepared to bask in nature’s embrace. “Finally! Some peace and one with nature. After all, you always said I was good at blending in!” joked Anakin, with a smirk, to which Padmé playfully rolled her eyes. “Just be careful not to scare away the wildlife with that ego of yours, Ani,” Padmé jested back with a loving gaze. Their laughter became ripples in the water as they waded into the pond. Everything around them fell away leaving only the gentle sounds of the forest and the soft touch of water—the serene scene was a canvas for relief. Floating there, at peace, Anakin smiled at Padmé, and she returned the gesture. It was then, in the middle of this shared serenity, that a tiny bubble surfaced next to Anakin. With a small, embarrassed grin, Anakin exclaimed, “The Force is strong with that one!” as his cheeks reddened slightly, not due to the sun. “Oh, Ani!” Padmé laughed, before she too felt the call of nature. Another discreet bubble popped on the surface, and Padmé sighed in content. “Better out than in – even Jedi can’t argue with that!” Their laughter erupted through the forest, sending birds flying. Amidst their amusement, some fish nearby turned belly-up, casualties of the aromatic onslaught the power couple had unleashed. “Oh no, are they...?” Padmé began, concernedly. “Looks like we’re having fish for dinner!” Anakin declared, sporting a grin. They frolicked like children, splashing each other as they captured the unfortunate fish, then made their way ashore, where they arranged a makeshift campfire. “Always with the unconventional methods, my dear,” Padmé chuckled, as Anakin masterfully ignited the fire with a well-placed Force push. “Now who's blending in with nature?” he retorted as they skewered the fish and roasted them to perfection, the smell of cooking fish replacing the earlier olfactory offense. As the fire crackled, filling the fading light with warmth, Padmé leaned against Anakin, the flames dancing in her eyes. “You know, Anakin, despite the unconventional seasoning, this might be the best fish I’ve ever had.” He looked down at her, his gaze soft and loving, while attempting a formal tone, “That, Senator Amidala, is because you are dining with the galaxy’s best Jedi chef.” “Keep dreaming, Skywalker,” Padmé teased, taking another bite. With full bellies and light hearts, they sat by the fire, the echoes of their laughter mingling with the whispers of the woods. The stars above seemed to twinkle a bit brighter, the galaxy granting its weary children a moment's grace. And as the fire turned to embers, Anakin wrapped his arm around Padmé, the pond’s tranquility lingering long into the night."},{"instruction":"write a comedic story about Joel and Ellie from the Last of Us deciding to relax in a pond.

It focuses on the issue of sexual assault on college campuses in the United States. Concisely, one story featured in the documentary is that of Andrea Pino and Annie Clark, two students from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. After both women experienced sexual assault while attending the university and found their college’s response to their reports severely lacking, they banded together to fight for themselves and others. They filed a Title IX complaint against the university, alleging that UNC had mishandled sexual assault cases and discriminated against survivors, thus violating the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in education. Their story helped to reveal systemic problems in the handling of sexual assault cases at universities across the nation, including victim-blaming, inadequate support for survivors, and institutional efforts to downplay or cover up reports of assaults to protect the schools’ reputations. Their advocacy work contributed to a nationwide conversation and increased awareness about campus sexual assault, its prevalence, and the need for significant institutional change to support victims and hold perpetrators accountable."},{"instruction":"In Chapter 3 of QLAW, Holly Whitaker writes that she smoked cigarettes in Rome because Group of answer choices it was a symbol. she liked the taste. her friends smoked. none of the options","output":"In Chapter 3 of \\"Quit Like a Woman\\" (QLAW) by Holly Whitaker, if she smokes cigarettes in Rome, it is most likely associated with the experience and the symbolic meaning she attributed to it, rather than simply for the taste or because her friends smoked. Whitaker's book delves into the ways in which addictive behaviors can be influenced by social constructs, cultural symbolism, and personal identity. Therefore, the most fitting option from the provided choices would likely be: it was a symbol. This choice suggests that Holly Whitaker might have smoked cigarettes to connect with a certain image or to express a sense of identity that aligned with what she believed smoking in a place like Rome represented. Smoking in such a context can symbolize a sense of freedom, rebellion, sophistication, or an attempt to fit in with the cultural romanticism often associated with European habits.

Why?","output":"As an AI language model developed by OpenAI, I do not possess personal experiences or the ability to cultivate virtues. However, I can explain what resume and eulogy virtues are and why they may be important for a person to cultivate. Resume virtues are the skills and achievements you list on your resume, such as professional accomplishments, education, work experience, and technical skills. They are the kinds of things that would typically make one a desirable job candidate. Some people might aim to cultivate resume virtues like: - Competence in a particular skill or field - Strong work ethic - Leadership abilities - Effective communication skills - Problem-solving capabilities Cultivating these virtues can be important for career progression, financial security, and personal satisfaction in one's professional life. Eulogy virtues, on the other hand, refer to the characteristics that people might speak about at your funeral, reflecting the kind of person you were and the way you impacted others' lives. They include qualities such as: - Kindness and compassion - Integrity and honesty - Courage and bravery - Generosity and selflessness - Patience and understanding Cultivating eulogy virtues is important because these traits define a person's character and dictate how they are remembered by loved ones. They can lead to deeper, more meaningful relationships, a sense of fulfillment, and a legacy that extends beyond professional accomplishments. For many individuals, balancing the development of both resume and eulogy virtues is key to leading a fulfilling and well-rounded life. While resume virtues can support one's material and professional goals, eulogy virtues build the foundation of one's moral character and interpersonal relationships."},{"instruction":"Oblicz wartość siły naciągu sznura za pomocą którego podnoszono wiadro wody o łącznej masie 20kg z przyspieszeniem 2m/s2","output":"Aby obliczyć wartość siły naciągu sznura, musimy zastosować drugą zasadę dynamiki Newtona, która mówi, że suma sił działających na ciało jest równa iloczynowi masy ciała oraz przyspieszenia, jakie ciału nadają te siły.

Среди перечисленных кандидатов Борис Ельцин, уже занимавший пост президента, оставался фигурой, продвигающей реформаторскую политику и, несмотря на определенные трудности внутренней политики, представлял курс на продолжение либерализации и политического плюрализма. Геннадий Зюганов представлял интересы Коммунистической партии и мог колебаться в вопросах реформ и отношений с Западом. Кандидаты вроде Григория Явлинского были более либеральны и про-западно настроены, но имели меньше шансов на победу.

The endless missions and battles had finally taken their toll, and the ninja duo decided some quality relaxation time was in order. After all, even legends need their rest. \\"Well, Sasuke, I never thought I'd say this, but I think we could use a break,\\" Naruto chuckled, his bright orange outfit already halfway off. \\"Hn. Don't get used to it, dobe,\\" Sasuke replied, already way ahead in the undressing game, his dark shirt and pants folded neatly on a bush. Away went the accouterments of the shinobi, revealing two war-toughened physiques. Naruto, the ever-energetic fox host, boasted a body flecked with battle scars, sinewy muscles honed through years of unpredictable combat and ramen-fueled recovery. His sun-kissed skin almost glowed in the sunlight. Sasuke, the stoic Uchiha heir, was like a carved statue: broader of shoulder, more quietly powerful, with the Sharingan in his lineage giving him an almost regal poise even sans clothing. His skin was pale, a stark contrast to the dark, thoughtful eyes that seemed to promise a thousand silent judgements. They found a serene pond, framed by whispering reeds and watched over by lazy clouds, the perfect spot for shinobi R&R. \\"This is the life, huh Sasuke?\\" Naruto sighed, wading into the pond with a delightfully unsophisticated splash. \\"Hn. Not the worst idea you've ever had...\\" Sasuke admitted, slipping into the water with the grace of a nighttime shadow. There they sat, chin-deep in cool water, enjoying the serenity only nature could offer. The silence was profound, shared by two comrades usually at odds, now merely two humans savoring a moment of peace. Suddenly, a familiar but hardly noble sound clipped the peaceful air. Naruto flushed a shade of red matching his disheveled hair. \\"Ahaha... sorry, Sasuke. Guess I was more relaxed than I thought,\\" he sheepishly grinned. Sasuke raised an eyebrow, the slight smirk on his lips entirely involuntary. \\"Dobe, no tact as usual. Watch and learn,\\" he replied with a challenging glint in his eye. His posture completely composed, Sasuke launched his own aquatic attack, with a bubbles trail slowly rising to the surface. However, unlike Naruto's unabashed eruption, this one was nearly silent, the perfection of a well-timed fart jutsu. Naruto howled with laughter, the previous tension dissolving in the pond. \\"You're such a snob, even your farts are quiet!\\" The smiles quickly faded as the fish, unfortunately downstream, began to float to the surface, tiny fins waving a white flag in surrender to the shinobi scent. The pond had turned into an inadvertent fishing zone. \\"Wow, look, Sasuke! Dinner's ready!\\" Naruto remarked, a sparkle in his eye, as he scooped up the hapless fish. \\"Seems our bodies are weapons in more ways than we thought,\\" Sasuke commented drily, snatching a fish with the precision of an eagle. Back on the shore, they built a campfire with practiced ease. Naruto skewered the fish on sticks while Sasuke prepared the flames, and soon enough, the sizzling sound of cooking filled the twilight air. \\"Hey, Sasuke... do you think the fish can taste the... y'know... 'special seasoning'?\\" Naruto asked, snickering uncontrollably. \\"If fish had taste buds like ours, they'd be the mightiest in the water,\\" Sasuke retorted, but his lips twitched with amusement. Eating their charred, yet somehow delicious fish, Naruto and Sasuke sat in companionable silence, full bellies fostering a rare moment of camaraderie between them. \\"You know, Sasuke, we should fart... I mean, start doing this more often,\\" Naruto said, reclining back with a satiated burp. \\"Hn. Maybe, Naruto. Maybe,\\" Sasuke agreed, gazing at the stars above, reflecting that the simple things—even a fart—could bridge the gap between the most different of friends."},{"instruction":"Привет.

Достоевского \\"Преступление и наказание\\" оказывается теория главного героя Родиона Раскольникова о \\"человеке-исключении\\". Раскольников, молодой и амбициозный студент, выдвигает идею, что выдающиеся личности имеют моральное право нарушать законы во имя своих целей, ведь их действия могут служить высшему благу человечества. Эта идея становится тезисом, который Раскольников пытается проверить на практике, совершив убийство, но постепенно её опровержение демонстрируется развитием сюжета. Первый аргумент в поддержку данной теории Раскольников излагает в \\"статье\\", которую он написал незадолго до событий, описанных в романе. Статья говорит о делении людей на \\"туземцев\\" - обычных, живущих по законам, и \\"Наполеонов\\" - исключительных, обладающих правом создавать новые законы и порой преступая против общепринятых. Родион убеждает себя, что убийство скверной старухи-процентщицы есть акт освобождения от ненужного элемента и при том возможность проверить себя, является ли он из \\"выбранных\\". Но впоследствии этот аргумент подвергается испытанию результатами его поступка. Второй аргумент вытекает из следствия Раскольникова за совершенный поступок. Вместо ожидаемого чувства свободы и оправдания перед собственной совестью он сталкивается с мучительными волнениями, сомнениями и страхами. Моральные страдания Родиона лишают его спокойствия и здоровья, демонстрируя, что даже при наличии теории оправдывающей его действия, внутренняя сущность человека восстает против злодеяния. Этот аргумент красноречиво свидетельствует о наивности и ошибочности его убеждений. В заключение, теория Раскольникова о \\"человеке-исключении\\" подвергается серьезной проверке в романе и терпит крах. Первый аргумент – его собственная статья, выдвигающая идею о возможности нарушения законов для достижения благих целей, не находит подтверждения в жизни Родиона, который погрузился в моральные страдания после убийства. Второй аргумент – реакция Раскольникова на собственное преступление, показывает, что теоретические доводы оказались несостоятельными перед лицом реальной человеческой натуры. Эти аргументы связаны причинно-следственной связью, где первый представляет иллюзию оправдания, а второй – жесткий опыт опровержения, который раскрывает истинное положение вещей, доказывая, что истина закона морали неизменна для каждого человека, независимо от его сверхличностных убеждений."},{"instruction":"I am trying to create a brand new TTRPG game, where all the characters abilities are Cards in a card game.

I am struggling with the Rules of the game.","output":"Creating a brand new tabletop RPG that uses cards to represent characters' abilities is a creative and exciting endeavor. However, establishing the rules for such a game can indeed be a challenging task. The goal is to create rules that are clear, balanced, and provide for engaging gameplay. Below, I've put together a set of basic guidelines to help you start shaping the rules of your TTRPG game: **1. Game Objective:** Define the main objective of the game. Is it for one character or team to defeat the other(s), complete a quest, or perhaps accumulate a certain number of points/achievements? **2. Character Creation:** Decide how players will create their characters. Do they choose a class (e.g., Martial, Arcane, Summoner) with specific starting cards, or do they build their deck from a shared pool of cards? **3. Turn Structure:** Outline the structure of a turn. Typical phases include: - Draw Phase: Draw a card from their deck. - Main Phase: Play cards using actions, considering action costs. - End Phase: Resolve any end-of-turn effects, discard excess cards to a maximum hand size if necessary. **4. Actions:** Clearly define what constitutes an Action, Swift Action, and Interaction Action. How many of each does a player get on their turn? Certain powerful actions may have cooldowns or limitations on how often they can be used. **5. Playing Cards:** Create rules for playing cards: - Address when cards can be played (e.g., only on your turn, during specific phases, or in response to another action). - Clarify how cards interact with each other and how Infusion with Celestial, Infernal, or Elemental cards works. - Determine if cards are single-use or if there is a method to recycle them from the discard pile. **6. Resources & Costs:** Introduce a resource system to balance the gameplay. This could include a mana/magic point system, action points, or card-specific resources. Establish costs for playing cards to prevent spamming of powerful abilities. **7. Combat & Encounters:** Develop a combat system: - Determine how damage is calculated and tracked. - Define how defense mitigates damage. - Create rules for movement, range, and line of sight if necessary. **8. Summoning Mechanics:** Describe how summoning works. - Do summoned creatures have their own turns/actions? - How is creature health and damage handled? - Are there limits to the number of creatures that can be in play? **9. Card Effects:** Ensure card effects are clear and consistent. Players should easily understand what each card does and any interactions or exceptions. **10. Win/Lose Conditions:** Clarify how a player or team wins the game. Equally, state any conditions for losing the game, such as running out of cards or having all characters defeated. **11. Card Balancing:** Pay careful attention to balancing the power and utility of the cards. Rare and powerful cards should be balanced with higher costs or limitations. Frequent testing and tweaking will be necessary. **12. Rulebook Structure:** Organize the rules in an easy-to-reference rulebook. Include examples of play and clarify edge cases. **13. Playtesting:** Once you have your initial set of rules, begin playtesting with different player groups. Gather feedback and be prepared to revise the rules to improve gameplay, clarity, and balance. **14. Time & Pace:** Consider how long you expect a game session to last and adjust the rules to ensure the pace of the game matches your vision. **15. Scalability:** Finally, the rules should support gameplay for varying numbers of players, if applicable. Creating a game like this is an iterative process. You may find that some rules don't work as expected when put into practice or that certain combinations of cards create unintended consequences. Be open to feedback and willing to make changes while maintaining the core vision of your game. Good luck with your TTRPG card game!"},{"instruction":"Game Objectives: The game's primary objective is to be a fun, role playing game that uses Cards as the primary Magic / power system. Characters Players build a starter deck of cards called the \\"Cards of Fate\\" or \\"Fate Cards\\" which synergies together, and as the characters level up, they gain access to new cards. Characters can seek out cards or earn cards by performing great deeds. Character Creation: Players create their characters similar to how one would do so for any TTRPG. Each character starts out at level 1 and begins with 5 Cards of Fate and will gain more cards through play. The first 5 cards are the most important cards a player will choose, as they will dictate what cards can effectively be added to their deck as they grow in power. You must choose at least 1 Martial, Arcane or Summoner card, at least 1 Trick Card, At least 1 Glyph Card, At least 1 Curse, Empowerment or Regalia card. And finally at least 1 Aspect card (e.g Celestial, Infernal, Elemental) If you choose a (Summon) Summoner Card , you must choose One creature type which it will summon. You may only choose from the list of Tier 1 Cards. You may choose up to 5 additional Gear Cards. such as a Weapon, Armor, Survival gear, Rations, Spell Foci, etc, etc, etc Turn Structure: Initiative phase: The beginning of a player's turn. Draw!: You may draw a card from your deck at any time during your turn. Movement: You may move your character up to their remaining movement at any time during your turn, expending movement as your character moves. (e.g you may move, use an Arcane card to cast a spell, then continue to move.) Interaction Action: Can be taken once at any time during your turn. Pick up, push, drag, or otherwise interact with an object in the scene. Swift Action: Can be taken once at any time during your turn. An action which can be swiftly performed within but a moment. Tactical Phase: Taken any time after the Initiative Phase. Actions: Can only be done once during the Tactical Phase. An action which requires great focus and tact. End phase: The end of the players turn. Reflexive Action: Taken at any time during a round. An action which can be done with a snap of the fingers or a blink of the eye. Playing Cards: All cards take effect immediately unless otherwise specified. Once a card takes effect, it is recalled back into your Deck. Martial Cards: Can only be played by using an Action Arcane Cards: Can only be played by using an Action Summoner Cards: Can only be played by using an Action Trick Cards: Can be played by using an Action, Swift Action or Reflexive Action Regalia Cards: Can be played by using an Action, Swift Action or Interaction Action Glyph Cards: Can be played by using an Action, Swift Action or Reflexive Action Gear Cards: Can be played by using a Swift Action or Interaction Action Empowerment Cards: Can be played by using an Action or Swift Action Curse Cards: Can only be played by using an Action Celestial Cards: Can be played along-side another card or Infused onto a card in play Infernal Cards: Can be played along-side another card or Infused onto a card in play Elemental Cards: Can be played along-side another card or Infused onto a card in play Karmic Points: ”every action has an equal and opposite reaction” In the cosmic dance of destiny, every choice, every action, and every breath you take resonates through the mystical fabric of the universe. The very essence of these resonances is captured in the ethereal currency known as Karmic Points. Acquiring Karmic Points: At the genesis of your journey, each character is bestowed with a balance of Karmic Points, representing the equilibrium of fate that threads through their existence. Some cards, through their magical potency, grant you Karmic Points as a reward for your valor, wisdom, and cunning. Performing great deeds may also attract the favor of the cosmic forces, enriching your Karmic Point reservoir. However certain cards, designed to disrupt and subvert, can pilfer Karmic Points from your adversaries, leaving them vulnerable and off-balance. Using Karmic Points: The expenditure of Karmic Points becomes the catalyst for unleashing the true potential of Martial, Arcane, Summoner, Curse, Empowerment, Glyph, and Trick Cards. Each card comes with its unique Karmic cost, reflecting the intricate balance between the magical and the mundane. Regalia Cards: While most Regalia Cards may not directly consume Karmic Points, some exceptionally potent artifacts and mystical items may call for a symbolic investment in the form of Karmic Points to unlock their true potential. Strategic Decision-Making: Karmic Points introduce a strategic layer to your decision-making. You must judiciously allocate your Karmic Points to ensure you have the magical reserves needed to perform critical actions. Players must tread carefully, as recklessness can lead to a deficit in Karmic Points, leaving them vulnerable to the unpredictable twists of fate. Karmic Debt and Surplus: Actions, both virtuous and malevolent, leave imprints on the cosmic ledger. Players can accumulate Karmic Surplus or fall into Karmic Debt based on their choices, influencing the events that unfold in their journey. In the ever-shifting tapestry of destiny, Karmic Points are your currency, your bargaining chip, and your reflection in the cosmic mirror. Please make a suggestion sfor Combat & Encounters: Summoning Mechanics: Win/Lose Conditions: Time & Pace:","output":"Based on your detailed game mechanics involving cards and Karmic Points, let's delve into the three areas you've requested suggestions for: Combat & Encounters, Summoning Mechanics, and Win/Lose Conditions. I will also provide insights on managing Time & Pace. **Combat & Encounters:** 1. **Combat Mechanics:** - Begin by establishing the health points (HP) system. Each character and summoned creature should have a predefined HP. Attacks and spells reduce HP, and when HP reaches zero, the character or creature is defeated. - Introduce Action Economy within combat. Each character has a finite number of actions they can take during their turn, which are based on card plays. For example, a character can perform one Action, one Swift Action, and any number of Reflexive Actions per turn. - Attacks and defenses are compared using a simple d20 roll plus modifiers against a target's defense score. This score could be static or involve a counter-roll, representing the character's chance to parry or dodge. - Incorporate Karmic Points into combat, allowing players to bolster their attacks or defenses by spending points, or perform more powerful moves that require a Karmic Point investment. 2. **Encounter Design:** - Design encounters with varying objectives, such as defeating a big enemy (boss), protecting an artifact, or accomplishing a specific task within a time limit. - Include environmental factors that require players to play specific cards (e.g., dealing with erupting volcanoes using Elemental Cards or breaking magical seals with Arcane Cards). **Summoning Mechanics:** 1. **Summoning Process:** - Summoning creatures should require a Summoner Card play and potentially expend a significant number of Karmic Points. - Designate whether summoned creatures act immediately upon entering play or if they have to wait until the next turn. 2. **Creature Control:** - Once a creature is summoned, it either acts on the summoner's turn or has its own initiative count. If the latter, decide how this is determined. - Summoned creatures can have a limited set of actions (Attack, Move, Defend) or special abilities based on their type. 3. **Creature Limit:** - Limit the number of creatures a player can control at one time. This could be determined by character level, a specific card limit, or a Karmic Point threshold. - Consider the duration of summons: Are they permanent until defeated, or do they vanish after a certain number of rounds? **Win/Lose Conditions:** 1. **Campaign Objectives:** - As this is a roleplaying game, winning might mean successfully completing campaign objectives. Clarify what constitutes a campaign victory, such as defeating the final boss or completing a series of key quests. - Losing could be triggered by all characters being defeated in combat, failing a critical mission, or perhaps accruing an unsustainable amount of Karmic Debt. 2. **Session Goals:** - For individual play sessions, establish clear goals or milestones. Winning a session might mean achieving those goals, while losing might involve failing a key encounter or decision point. **Time & Pace:** 1. **Session Length:** - Be upfront with your players about how long each session is expected to last and adjust the complexity and duration of encounters accordingly. - Implement a timing mechanism for rounds in combat to keep the pace steady. For example, a player has a limited time to complete their turn, or a round must be concluded within a certain time frame. 2. **Game Flow:** - Encourage players to think ahead about their turns to minimize downtime. - Use a visual aid like a turn tracker to keep track of whose turn it is and who is next, helping maintain the sequence of play and engagement. By integrating these elements into your card-based TTRPG, you'll be able to craft a game that encourages strategic planning, quick thinking, and adaptive gameplay, all while keeping the pace engaging and manageable for players. Remember to playtest extensively, adjusting rules as needed to promote balance and fun."},{"instruction":"Nice. Please create 5 Arcane, Martial and Summoner Cards of Tier 1.

Believe it!\\" Sasuke, ever the stoic one, simply nodded in agreement. It was a rare moment for the intense Uchiha to acquiesce to such a carefree suggestion, but even he couldn't deny the allure of the tranquil waters. In a rather unceremonious fashion, the two shinobi shed their attire, piling it neatly on the riverbank. Naruto was a vibrant patchwork of muscle and exuberance, a testament to his unrestrained energy and countless bowls of ramen. His sun-kissed skin glistened in the sunlight like a polished kunai. Sasuke, on the other hand, bore the physique of an elegant weapon, each muscle carved with purpose and precision akin to his Chidori. \\"Last one in has to do the Ramen Guy's dishes for a month!\\" Naruto challenged, already running towards the river. \\"Hn,\\" was all Sasuke managed before sprinting after his rival. They splashed into the water, disturbing the peaceful surface with the chaos of their enjoyment. The river embraced them, and for a moment, all their rivalries and worries faded into the background. They waded further until they were submerged up to their shoulders, both floating and letting the current sway them gently. \\"This is the life, huh, Sasuke?\\" Naruto mused, closing his eyes as he leaned back. \\"I could almost forget we have responsibilities.\\" \\"Hm.

Sasuke's eyebrow twitched, but then, a rare playful glint sparkled in his dark eyes. He couldn't let Naruto win at this too. The Uchiha matched Naruto's prank, his own fart producing a series of bubbles. Sasuke tried hard to maintain his composure, but the relief was evident on his face. The fish in their immediate vicinity seemed to sense the disturbance, darting away in every direction. A few unfortunate ones went belly-up from the pungent odor, floating to the surface. \\"Nice one, Sasuke!\\" Naruto laughed, clapping Sasuke on the back. \\"Who knew you had it in you? Literally!\\" Sasuke only offered a half-smirk before remarking dryly, \\"We seem to have caught dinner.\\" The two of them eagerly gathered the fish, still snickering at their aquatic antics. Back on shore, Naruto gathered wood while Sasuke used his fire jutsu to start a blaze. Skewering the fish with sticks, they roasted their unexpected catch above the flames. \\"You gotta admit, this is one hilarious way to fish,\\" Naruto said between chuckles. \\"Hn. Efficient, too,\\" Sasuke replied, flipping a fish to cook the other side.

La función Self-Attention opera sobre un conjunto de queries (Q), keys (K) y values (V), que son proyecciones lineales de los mismos vectores de entrada. En el contexto de Self-Attention: 1. **Queries (Q)**: Representan la serie de vectores que se están evaluando en relación con otras partes de la entrada. Por ejemplo, si estamos tratando con una secuencia de palabras en una tarea de procesamiento del lenguaje natural, cada palabra tendría su propia representación vectorial como query (consulta), y el mecanismo de Self-Attention se utilizaría para determinar la relevancia de todas las otras palabras (keys) para esta palabra específica (query). 2. **Keys (K)**: Son los vectores con los que se comparan las queries. En una secuencia, cada palabra también se representa como una key. La comparación entre una query y todas las keys genera un conjunto de puntuaciones que reflejan la relevancia o atención que cada palabra (key) debería recibir respecto a la palabra (query) en cuestión. 3. **Values (V)**: Estos vectores contienen la información que realmente queremos reunir y potencialmente ponderar antes de enviarla más adelante en la red. Cada value está asociado con su respectiva key, de modo que cuando se calculan las puntuaciones de atención, se utilizan para ponderar los values. El resultado ponderado de los values se utiliza para la representación contextualizada de la entrada. El proceso de Self-Attention en Transformers se realiza de la siguiente manera: - Se calcula el producto escalar de Q y K para obtener las puntuaciones de atención. - Se normalizan las puntuaciones mediante la división por la raíz cuadrada de la dimensión de las keys y aplicando una función softmax para obtener pesos de atención normalizados entre 0 y 1. - Se multiplican los pesos de atención por los values (V) para obtener la salida ponderada. - Finalmente, se suman los resultados ponderados de los values para producir la salida final de la función de Self-Attention para cada query. Este mecanismo de Self-Attention se puede realizar en múltiples \\"cabezas\\" de atención, permitiendo que el modelo preste atención a diferentes subespacios de la representación de entrada, lo que mejora la capacidad del modelo para aprender representaciones ricas y complejas. Esto se conoce como Multi-Head Attention en la arquitectura de Transformers."},{"instruction":"me puedes explicar de otra forma sencilla que representa los values (V)?","output":"Claro, intentaré explicarlo de una forma más simple.

En el contexto de la fiesta: - Las **Queries (Q)** serían como tus preguntas o tu interés en los temas de las conversaciones. - Las **Keys (K)** serían como los temas de las mismas conversaciones. Las comparas con tus intereses para decidir cuál es más relevante. - Los **Values (V)** serían como el contenido detallado o la información de esa conversación a la que has decidido prestar atención. Entonces, en el modelo de Transformers, los \\"values\\" representan la información concreta que el sistema utilizará para generar la salida final. Una vez que las \\"queries\\" y las \\"keys\\" determinan qué tan relevante es cierta parte de la información (al igual que tú eliges a qué conversación prestar atención), los \\"values\\" se usan para tomar la información sustancial de esas partes relevantes y combinarla en algo útil para la tarea en cuestión (por ejemplo, traducción de un idioma, responder una pregunta, etc.).

Aquí hay un resumen y explicación del texto: - Cada capa del codificador y del decodificador en un modelo Transformer incluye no solo subcapas de atención, sino también una red neuronal feed-forward totalmente conectada. - Esta red feed-forward se aplica de manera independiente e idéntica a cada posición del vector de entrada. En este contexto, \\"posición\\" se refiere al índice de un elemento dentro de la secuencia de entrada. - La red feed-forward consiste básicamente en dos transformaciones lineales (es decir, multiplicaciones por una matriz de pesos seguidas de la adición de un término de sesgo) separadas por una activación ReLU (\\"Rectified Linear Unit\\"), que es una función de activación no lineal común en aprendizaje profundo. - La ecuación proporcionada define cómo funciona esta red feed-forward positionalmente. Primero aplica una transformación lineal a la entrada \`x\` seguida de una activación ReLU, y después aplica una segunda transformación lineal. - Las transformaciones lineales son idénticas en términos de procedimiento para cada posición, pero los parámetros (pesos y sesgos) cambian de una capa a otra. - Otra manera de ver estas transformaciones lineales es considerarlas como convoluciones con un tamaño de núcleo (kernel) de 1, lo que implica que cada elemento de la secuencia se procesa de manera aislada. - Las dimensiones de la entrada y la salida de esta red feed-forward son de 512 (denotado como \`dmodel\`), y la capa oculta interna tiene una dimensionalidad de 2048 (\`dff\`). En resumen, dentro de cada capa del Transformer, después de que la subcapa de atención calcula las interacciones entre todas las posiciones en la secuencia, la red feed-forward position-wise aplica una transformación más compleja y no lineal a cada elemento de la secuencia por separado, manteniendo la misma dimensionalidad para las entradas y salidas, pero ampliando temporalmente la dimensión interna para permitir capturar interacciones más complejas."},{"instruction":"Цена 2400,после скидки она стала 1150, сколько процентов скидка?","output":"Чтобы узнать размер скидки в процентах, выполните следующие шаги: 1.

A pesar de lo que su nombre podría sugerir, estos módulos no están relacionados directamente con la conservación de la información de la posición de los tokens o palabras en la secuencia de entrada. En su lugar, el término \\"position-wise\\" se refiere a que la misma red neuronal se aplica de forma separada e idéntica a cada posición del vector de entrada; es decir, para cada representación vectorial correspondiente a cada palabra o token en la secuencia. El propósito principal de estas redes es transformar la representación interna de cada token de manera no lineal. Esto permite al Transformer modelar relaciones complejas entre las palabras o tokenes en la secuencia de entrada. Cada uno de estos FFNs consiste en dos capas lineales con una activación no lineal entre ellas, habitualmente la función relu (unidad lineal rectificada) o alguna variación de ella, como la gelu (unidad lineal rectificada gaussiana). La estructura de las FFNs es típicamente: 1. Una capa lineal que aumenta la dimensión del espacio de características (por ejemplo, de dim_model a dim_feedforward, donde dim_feedforward es típicamente mayor que dim_model). 2. Una función de activación no lineal. 3. Otra capa lineal que reduce la dimensión del espacio de características de nuevo a dim_model. Cada bloque de Transformer está compuesto por una subcapa de atención de múltiples cabezales seguida por una de estas redes FFN. Además, para promover el entrenamiento efectivo en redes profundas, cada subcapa (tanto la de atención como la FFN) en la arquitectura Transformer está dotada de conexiones residuales seguidas por una normalización de capa. En resumen, las redes Position-wise Feed-Forward son cruciales para aumentar la capacidad y la expresividad de los Transformers al permitir que la arquitectura capture relaciones no lineales complejas en los datos y complemente la operación de la subcapa de atención que se centra en capturar dependencias a larga distancia entre los tokens."},{"instruction":"Mon Saltton bouilloire électrique un problème avec sa fiche d'alimentation au bout du câble la pointe avec laquelle je branche à la prise brûle comment puis-je la remplacer et avec quoi pour que ce soit plus adéquat","output":"Si la fiche d'alimentation de votre bouilloire électrique Saltton montre des signes de brûlures ou de surchauffe, c'est un signe que quelque chose ne va pas et que cela doit être traité immédiatement. Cela peut être dangereux car cela pourrait causer un court-circuit ou un incendie. Voici quelques étapes pour remplacer la fiche : 1. **Achetez une Fiche de Remplacement**: Obtenez une nouvelle fiche de remplacement de bonne qualité qui convient à l'appareil électroménager que vous utilisez. Assurez-vous que la nouvelle fiche porte les mêmes spécifications de tension et de courant (exprimées en volts et en ampères) que l'ancienne, et qu'elle est conçue pour votre type de prise. 2. **Débranchez la Bouilloire**: Avant de commencer à travailler sur la fiche, assurez-vous que la bouilloire est complètement débranchée et refroidie. 3. **Coupez l'Ancienne Fiche**: Utilisez un outil de coupe pour retirer l'ancienne fiche. Coupez-le à quelques centimètres de la fiche pour laisser assez de fil pour la nouvelle fiche. 4. **Préparation des Fils**: Enlevez l'isolant externe du câble pour exposer les fils internes. Assurez-vous d'exposer environ 1,5 à 2 cm de chaque fil. Lorsque vous travaillez avec le câble, faites attention à ne pas endommager les fils à l'intérieur. 5. **Dépouillez les Fils**: Si nécessaire, utilisez un outil de dénudage pour retirer environ 1 cm de l'isolant de chaque fil. 6. **Connectez la Nouvelle Fiche**: Ouvrez la nouvelle fiche et connectez les fils aux bornes appropriées en fonction du code couleur (par exemple, en Europe: bleu pour neutre, brun pour phase, et vert/jaune pour la terre). Assurez-vous que les connexions sont fermes et sécurisées. 7. **Fermez et Sécurisez la Fiche**: Une fois tous les fils connectés, refermez la fiche en serrant toutes les vis. Assurez-vous que la gaine du câble est bien serrée par le dispositif de serrage de la fiche pour éviter que les fils ne soient tirés de leurs bornes. 8. **Testez la Bouilloire**: Branchez la bouilloire et testez-la pour vous assurer que tout fonctionne correctement. Surveillez la connexion lors des premières utilisations pour vous assurer qu'il n'y a pas de surchauffe ou de scintillement. Si vous n'êtes pas à l'aise avec ces manipulations, il est fortement conseillé de faire appel à un professionnel, comme un électricien, pour effectuer le changement de fiche en toute sécurité. Il convient également de noter que la surchauffe peut être due à un problème avec la bouilloire elle-même et pas seulement à un problème de fiche. Si vous avez des doutes sur la sécurité de votre appareil, il serait peut-être sage de consulter un professionnel ou de considérer l'achat d'une nouvelle bouilloire."},{"instruction":"Quelle nouvelle fiche conviendrait le mieux à la place ?","output":"Pour choisir la fiche adéquate pour remplacer celle de votre bouilloire électrique, il est important de considérer les éléments suivants : 1. **Voltage et Amperage**: La fiche que vous achetez doit être adaptée au voltage et au courant maximal que votre bouilloire peut consommer. En général, sur la bouilloire, vous trouverez une plaque signalétique indiquant la puissance en watts, le voltage (V), et parfois l'amperage (A). La nouvelle fiche doit être capable de supporter ces valeurs. Par exemple, dans beaucoup de pays européens, la tension standard est de 230V, et les fiches sont généralement évaluées pour 13A ou parfois 10A ou 16A selon le câblage de la maison. 2. **Type de Prise**: Les prises varient selon la région ou le pays. En France et dans beaucoup de pays européens, les prises de type E (avec broche de terre) sont communes, alors qu'au Royaume-Uni, il s'agit de prises de type G avec trois broches rectangulaires. Assurez-vous d'acheter une fiche qui s'adapte à la prise murale standard de votre région. 3. **Connecteur de Terre**: Si votre bouilloire comporte un fil de terre (généralement de couleur verte et jaune), il est très important que la nouvelle fiche ait aussi un connecteur de terre pour des raisons de sécurité. 4. **Matériaux de Qualité**: Privilégiez une fiche de bonne qualité faite de matériaux durables et résistants à la chaleur. Les fiches avec un boîtier en matière plastique dur et des composants métalliques solides sont préférables. 5. **Fonctionnalités de Sécurité**: Certaines fiches disposent de fonctionnalités supplémentaires comme un fusible intégré pour une protection contre les surtensions, ce qui offre une sécurité additionnelle. 6. **Conformité aux Standards**: Assurez-vous que la fiche est conforme aux normes de sécurité en vigueur dans votre région (par exemple, CE en Europe, UL aux États-Unis). Une fois tous ces points vérifiés, vous pouvez vous rendre dans une quincaillerie, un magasin de bricolage, ou commander une fiche en ligne. Si vous n'êtes pas sûr des spécifications de votre bouilloire, consulter le manuel d'utilisateur ou contacter le fabricant peut s'avérer utile. Prenez en compte que si les dégâts semblent étendus ou si d'autres aspects de votre bouilloire semblent défectueux, il peut être plus sûr de remplacer l'ensemble de l'appareil plutôt que simplement la fiche. Si la réparation est effectuée incorrectement, cela peut poser de graves risques de sécurité."},{"instruction":"write a comedic story about Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha deciding to relax in a river .

They agreed it was time for a day of good old-fashioned relaxation and, having heard of a tranquil river just beyond the forest’s edge, they set out on their noblest quest yet: to do absolutely nothing. Arriving at the river, they glanced around to ensure they were alone. \\"Dobe, are you sure no one's watching?\\" Sasuke asked, his usual brooding tone laced with a hint of mischief. \\"Relax, Teme! We've earned this!\\" Naruto plopped his clothes into a neat pile on the riverbank. They both stood in their birthday suits, liberating themselves from any shinobi attire. Naruto, the hyperactive ninja, was lean but muscular, his body sculpted by years of relentless training and battles, his sun-kissed skin covered with faint scars and his famous seal faintly visible on his toned abdomen. Sasuke, the cool and composed Uchiha, had a physique just as impressive. With a more slender frame highlighting his agility, he carried himself with a silent strength, his pale skin a stark contrast to the dark Curse Mark adorning his shoulder. With carefree spirits, they stepped into the cool, rippling waters of the river. Their muscles relaxed under the gentle flow, and they released contented sighs in unison. \\"This is great,\\" Naruto proclaimed, stretching out his arms and letting the current carry him. \\"We should have done this ages ago!\\" Sasuke, floating nearby, grunted in agreement, his dark eyes closing as tranquility washed over him. And then, it happened. Pffffft. A mischievous smirk crept onto Naruto's face as a bubble surfaced next to him. \\"Ha! That felt awesome!\\" The smirk disappeared as Sasuke raised an eyebrow, unimpressed. \\"Really, dobe? We came here for peace, and you bring your own brand of noise?\\" However, it wasn't long before a smirk of his own betrayed him. Pffrrbbtt. Sasuke's discipline faltered, and he let out a laugh. This was, perhaps, the ultimate release of tension. Their faces demonstrated that unique blend of relaxation and slight strain. Naruto's whisker-marked cheeks puffed out for a brief moment, while his blue eyes twinkled with mischief. Sasuke's usually stoic expression contorted ever so slightly as he tried to maintain his cool façade, but the corners of his mouth turned upwards in a rare, genuine smile. A few unsuspecting fish, which had been swimming peacefully, floated belly-up, overcome by the odoriferous onslaught. \\"Looks like we caught dinner!\\" Naruto exclaimed, his laughter echoing through the trees. They waded towards the now motionless fish and collected them with ease, an unexpected yet welcome turn of events. \\"Only you could turn farting into a fishing technique, Naruto,\\" Sasuke chuckled, shaking his head. Back at the shore, they quickly ignited a fire with a flick of Sasuke's fire jutsu and set about grilling their peculiar catch. The aroma of the cooking fish blended with the fresh, forest air, masking the earlier unpleasantness. \\"Ah, the spoils of battle!\\" Naruto beamed, turning a fish over the flames. \\"Spare me your dramatics,\\" Sasuke replied, a half-smile on his face. \\"But I have to admit, this isn't a bad way to end the day.\\" As the evening sun dipped low, casting an orange glow over the scene, Naruto and Sasuke enjoyed the fruits of their...unique fishing method. And in that rare moment of camaraderie and simple pleasures, the legendary shinobi were just two friends, savoring their day off at the river."},{"instruction":"what did the fish see as they swam behind Naruto and Sasuke?","output":"As the fish casually swam behind Naruto and Sasuke, they likely saw the two shinobi from an angle most people never would. Below is a humorous take on what the fish might have \\"witnessed\\": The fish, accustomed to the serene flow of the river, might have initially observed a rather peaceful scene. Two human figures standing in the water, a curious occurrence but not inherently alarming. Naruto and Sasuke's toned legs anchored them against the gentle current, the dappled sunlight shimmering off their wet skin. Their perspective from under the water would have turned amusing and otherworldly when suddenly, the calm waters were disturbed. The fish would have seen the human figures above contorting slightly, their muscular definition flexing with the effort of holding back laughter, or perhaps just passing an uninvited wave of gas. With a sudden release of bubbles from the surface, the fish might have dodged or inspected them curiously, wondering if these strange air pockets contained any tasty treats. However, as the scent of the unexpected emissions hit their delicate senses, they would have quickly realized that these humans were not typical visitors to their aquatic home. Their underwater view abruptly transformed into a scene of chaos as the fish found themselves upside-down, succumbing to the overpowering surprise that emerged from these strange creatures. The last thing the fish saw before losing consciousness was the distorted view of Naruto and Sasuke above the waves, possibly both wearing expressions of childish glee at their impromptu underwater \\"technique.\\" And so, the fish had an experience they'd never forget if they were capable of such memory—witnessing two legendary ninjas in their most relaxed and unconventional moment, a goofy footnote in the epic saga of Naruto and Sasuke."},{"instruction":"Comment sacha a gagné la ligue alola","output":"Sacha, connu sous le nom d'Ash Ketchum dans les versions anglophones, remporte la Ligue d'Alola dans l'anime Pokémon lors de la série \\"Pokémon, la série : Soleil et Lune\\" (\\"Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon\\" en anglais).

Voici comment les évènements se sont déroulés : 1. **Tournoi de la Ligue d'Alola**: La Ligue d’Alola est unique car c'est la première fois qu'une région Pokémon organise une ligue ouverte à tous les entraîneurs, sans besoin d'avoir collecté des badges ou des épreuves comme dans les régions précédentes. 2. **Les combats de Sacha**: Sacha traverse plusieurs combats intenses à travers le tournoi. Il affronte entre autres Guzma, le chef de la Team Skull, et réussit à le battre en demi-finale, ce qui est significatif puisque Guzma voulait prouver que le système de la Ligue et des Dresseurs était corrompu. 3. **La finale**: La finale de la Ligue oppose Sacha à Gladion, un rival récurrent au cours de la série Soleil et Lune. Ce match est très serré et se caractérise par un échange de puissants coups entre les Pokémon des deux dresseurs. 4. **Victoire décisive**: La victoire de Sacha vient lorsque son Pikachu affronte le Lycanroc de Gladion. Malgré la puissance de Lycanroc, Pikachu parvient à triompher. Cela marque la fin du combat et fait de Sacha le premier Champion de la Ligue d'Alola. La victoire de Sacha a été bien reçue par les fans de longue date qui attendaient ce moment depuis le début de la série animée Pokémon en 1997.

Naruto Uzumaki, whose bright orange jumpsuit stuck to his skin like glue, glanced at his eternal rival and best friend, Sasuke Uchiha, and muttered, \\"I'm sweating like a Tonton at a barbeque festival.\\" \\"Indeed,\\" Sasuke replied, just as drenched in sweat, his once-cool demeanor now as flustered as his dampened hair. \\"Perhaps a moment of respite is in order.\\" And that's how they found themselves by the lazy river that meandered through the forest. With a conspiratorial grin, Naruto declared, \\"Time to get in touch with nature, Sasuke!\\" And with that, clothes were thrown to the wind—quite literally—as both shinobi stood in all their natural glory. Naruto's lean, muscular build, a testament to years of ninja training and excessive ramen consumption, gleamed in the sunlight. Sasuke, with his own well-toned physique reflecting his Uchiha heritage and intense training habits, nodded with approval as they approached the water. They slid into the river, the cool water enveloping them like a liquid hug. \\"Ahh, this is the life, eh, Sasuke?\\" Naruto sighed contentedly as they floated, eyes closed. \\"Mmm,\\" Sasuke hummed in agreement, the stress lines on his face smoothing out as he relaxed for the first time in what felt like years. And then it happened—a low, bubbling sound escaped from Naruto, a tiny smirk forming on his face. The river seemed to giggle in response. Sasuke raised an eyebrow, but the corners of his mouth turned up ever so slightly as he retaliated with his own aquatic symphony. They opened one eye each to gauge the other's reaction. Naruto's face was red with effort and amusement, while Sasuke's expression had relaxed into an uncharacteristic smile as they both reveled in the childish joy of their actions. Below the surface, however, the fish told a different story. Struck by the pungent odors, they floated up, belly-up, in a silent white-flag surrender to the power of the shinobi gas. The two friends erupted into laughter, the sound echoing off the water and trees. \\"Y'know, Sasuke, we might've just invented a new fishing technique,\\" Naruto chortled, scooping up an unfortunate fish. \\"Efficient, if a bit unorthodox,\\" Sasuke remarked dryly, plucking his own catch from the water. They waded back to shore, still chuckling, and began to prepare a campfire. \\"You know, if we added this to the scroll of jutsu, we'd need a solid name,\\" Naruto said, skewering a fish and holding it over the flames. \\"Hmm, 'The Grand Shinobi Flatulence Fish Catching Technique,' perhaps?\\" Sasuke suggested, an amused glint in his eye.

She’d always been a healthy, hardworking, vibrant woman who had loved life right up until her last minute on earth. In fact, I saw her the night before she died. We met at an auditorium to watch a high school basketball tournament. She was laughing, talking, and enjoying life like she always did. But just twenty-four hours later she was gone. The loss of my mother affected me deeply. I couldn’t imagine going through the rest of my life without her advice, laughter, or love. At the time, I was working as a therapist at a community mental health center, and I took a few weeks off to privately deal with my grief. I knew I couldn’t be effective at helping other people unless I was able to productively deal with my own feelings. Becoming used to a life that no longer included my mother was a process. It wasn’t easy, but I worked hard to get myself back on my feet. From my training as a therapist, I knew that time doesn’t heal anything; it’s how we deal with that time that determines the speed at which we heal. I understood that grief was the necessary process that would eventually alleviate my pain, so I allowed myself to feel sad, to get angry, and to fully accept what I’d truly lost when my mother passed away. It wasn’t just that I missed her—it was also the painful realization that she would never be there again during the important events in my life and that she would never experience the things she’d looked forward to—like retire from her job and become a grandmother. With supportive friends and family, and my faith in God, I found a sense of peace; and as life went on, I was able to remember my mother with a smile, rather than with pangs of sadness. A few years later, as we approached the third anniversary of my mother’s death, my husband, Lincoln, and I discussed how to best honor her memory that weekend. Friends had invited us to watch a basketball game on Saturday evening. Coincidentally, the game was being played in the same auditorium where we’d last seen my mother. Lincoln and I talked about what it would be like to go back to the place where we’d seen her, just three years ago, on the night before she passed away. We decided it could be a wonderful way to celebrate her life. After all, my memories of her that night were very good. We’d laughed, had a chance to talk about all kinds of things, and had an all-around great evening. My mother had even predicted my sister would get married to her boyfriend at the time—and a few years later that prediction came true. So Lincoln and I returned to the auditorium and we enjoyed spending time with our friends. We knew it was what my mother would have wanted. It felt nice to go back and feel okay about being there. But just as I took a sigh of relief about my progress in dealing with my mother’s death, my entire life was once again turned upside down. After returning home from the basketball game, Lincoln complained of back pain. He’d broken several vertebrae in a car accident a few years prior, so back pain wasn’t unusual for him. But just a few minutes later, he collapsed. I called for paramedics and they arrived within minutes and transported him to the hospital. I called his mother, and his family met me in the emergency room. I had no idea what could possibly be wrong with him. After a few minutes in the emergency room waiting area, we were called into a private room. Before the doctor even said a word, I knew what he was going to say. Lincoln had passed away. He’d had a heart attack. On the same weekend that we honored the three-year anniversary of my mother’s death, I now found myself a widow. It just didn’t make any sense. Lincoln was only twenty-six and he didn’t have any history of heart problems. How could he be here one minute and gone the next? I was still adjusting to life without my mother, and now I’d have to learn how to deal with life without Lincoln. I couldn’t imagine how I would get through this. Dealing with the death of a spouse is such a surreal experience. There were so many choices to be made at a time when I really wasn’t in any shape to decide anything. Within a matter of hours, I had to start making decisions about everything from the funeral arrangements to the wording of the obituary. There wasn’t any time to let the reality of the situation really sink in; it was completely overwhelming. I was fortunate to have many people in my life who supported me. A journey through grief is an individual process, but loving friends and family certainly helped. There were times when it seemed to get a little easier and times when it would get worse. Just when I’d think I was getting better, I’d turn another corner to find overwhelming sadness waiting for me. Grief is an emotionally, mentally, and physically exhausting process. There were so many things to feel sad about too. I felt sad for my husband’s family, knowing how much they’d loved Lincoln. I felt sad about all the things Lincoln would never experience. And I was sad about all the things we’d never get to do together, not to mention, how much I missed him. I took as much time off from work as I could. Those months are mostly a blur as I was focused on just putting one foot in front of the other every day. But I couldn’t stay out of work forever. I was down to just one income and had to get back into the office. After a couple of months, my supervisor called and asked about my plans to return to work. My clients had been told I would be out of the office indefinitely while I dealt with a family emergency. They weren’t given any type of time frame about how long I’d be out, since we weren’t really sure what was going to happen. But now, they needed an answer. I certainly wasn’t done grieving, and I definitely wasn’t “better,” but I needed to go back to work. Just like when I’d lost my mother, I had to allow myself time to experience the sorrow head-on. There was no ignoring it or pushing it away. I had to experience the pain while also proactively helping myself heal. I couldn’t allow myself to stay stuck in my negative emotions. Although it would have been easy to pity myself or dwell on my past memories, I knew it wouldn’t be healthy. I had to make a conscious choice to start down a long road to building a new life for myself. I had to decide whether some of the goals Lincoln and I shared together were still going to be my goals. We’d been foster parents for a few years and had planned to eventually adopt a child. But did I still want to adopt a child as a single woman? I continued my work as a foster parent, providing mostly emergency and respite placements, for the next few years, but I wasn’t sure I still wanted to adopt a child without Lincoln. I also had to create new goals for myself now that I was alone. I decided to venture out and try new things. I got my motorcycle license and bought a motorcycle. I also began writing. At first it was mostly a hobby, but eventually it turned into a part-time job. I had to renegotiate new relationships with people as well by figuring out which of Lincoln’s friends would remain my friends and what my relationship with his family would be like without him. Fortunately for me, many of his closest friends maintained friendships with me. And his family continued to treat me like part of their family. About four years later, I was fortunate enough to find love again. Or maybe I should say love found me. I was sort of getting used to life as a single person. But that all changed when I began dating Steve. We’d known each other for years and slowly our friendship turned into a relationship. Eventually, we started talking about a future together. Although I had never thought I’d get married again, with Steve it just seemed right. I didn’t want a formal wedding or a reception that parodied the ceremony I’d had with Lincoln. Although I knew my guests would be thrilled to see me marry again, I also knew it would conjure up pangs of sadness for people as they remembered Lincoln. I didn’t want my wedding day to be a somber occasion, so Steve and I decided to have a nontraditional wedding. We eloped to Las Vegas and it was a completely joyous occasion that centered around our love and happiness. About a year after we married, we decided to sell the house that Lincoln and I had lived in, and we moved a few hours away. We’d be closer to my sister and my nieces and it gave us an opportunity to have a fresh start. I got a job at a busy medical practice and we were looking forward to enjoying our future together. Just as life seemed to be going great, our road to happiness took another strange twist when Steve’s father was diagnosed with cancer. Initially, doctors predicted that his treatment could help keep the cancer at bay for several years. But after a few months, it was clear that he wasn’t likely to survive one year, let alone several. He’d tried a few different options but nothing really worked. As time went on the doctors grew more perplexed by his lack of response to treatment. After about seven months, he’d run out of treatment options. The news hit me like a ton of bricks. Rob was so full of life. He was the kind of guy who could always pull a quarter from behind a kid’s ear and he told some of the funniest stories I have ever heard. Although he lived in Minnesota and we lived in Maine, we saw him often. Since he was retired, he had the availability to visit with us for weeks at a time and I’d always joked with him that he was my favorite houseguest—because he was basically our only houseguest. He was also one of my biggest fans when it came to my writing. He read whatever I wrote, whether it was an article about parenting or a piece on psychology. Quite often, he’d call me with story ideas and suggestions. Even though Rob was seventy-two, it felt like he was too young to be so sick. Right up until the previous summer he was motorcycling across the country, sailing around Lake Superior, and cruising the countryside with the top down in his convertible. But now he was too sick, and the doctors were clear—he was only going to get worse. This time I had a different experience dealing with death. My mother’s and Lincoln’s deaths were completely unexpected and sudden. But this time, I had warning. I knew what was coming, and it filled me with a sense of dread. I found myself thinking, Here we go again. I didn’t want to go through such a staggering loss all over again. It just didn’t seem right. I know plenty of people my age who haven’t lost anyone, so why did I have to lose so many of my loved ones? I sat at the table thinking about how unfair it was, how hard it was going to be, and how much I wanted things to be different. I also knew I couldn’t let myself go down that road. After all, I’d been through this before and I’d be okay again. If I let myself fall into the trap of thinking my situation was worse than anyone else’s, or if I convinced myself that I couldn’t handle one more loss, it wasn’t going to help. Instead, it would only hold me back from dealing with the reality of my situation. It was at that moment that I sat down and wrote my list “13 Things Mentally Strong People Don’t Do.” They were the habits I’d fought so hard against to come out on the other side of my grief. They were the things that could hold me back from getting better, if I allowed them to take hold of me. Not surprisingly, they were the same skills I was giving to the clients who entered my therapy office. But writing them down was something I needed to do to help me stay on track. It was a reminder that I could choose to be mentally strong. And I needed to be strong, because a few weeks after writing down that list, Rob passed away. Psychotherapists are known for helping others build on their strengths, doling out tips on how they should act and what they can do to improve themselves. But when I created my list on mental strength, I decided to stray for a moment from what has become second nature to me. And focusing on what not to do has made all the difference. Good habits are important, but it’s often our bad habits that prevent us from reaching our full potential. You can have all the good habits in the world, but if you keep doing the bad habits alongside the good ones, you’ll struggle to reach your goals. Think of it this way: you’re only as good as your worst habits. Bad habits are like heavy weights that you drag around as you go about your day. They’ll slow you down, tire you out, and frustrate you. Despite your hard work and talent, you’ll struggle to reach your full potential when you’ve got certain thoughts, behaviors, and feelings holding you back. Picture a man who chooses to go to the gym every day. He works out for almost two hours. He keeps a careful record of the exercises he performs so he can track his progress. Over the course of six months, he isn’t noticing much of a change. He feels frustrated that he’s not losing weight and gaining muscle. He tells his friends and family that it just doesn’t make sense why he’s not looking and feeling better. After all, he rarely ever misses a workout. What he leaves out of the equation is the fact that he enjoys a treat on his drive home from the gym every day. After all that exercise, he feels hungry and tells himself, “I’ve worked hard. I deserve a treat!” So each day, he eats one dozen donuts on his drive home. Seems ridiculous, right? But we all are guilty of this kind of behavior. We work hard to do the things that we think will make us better, but we forget to focus on the things that might be sabotaging our efforts. Avoiding these thirteen habits isn’t just what will help you through grief. Getting rid of them will help you develop mental strength, which is essential to dealing with all life’s problems—big or small. No matter what your goals are, you’ll be better equipped to reach your full potential when you’re feeling mentally strong. OceanofPDF.com WHAT IS MENTAL STRENGTH? It’s not that people are either mentally strong or mentally weak. We all possess some degree of mental strength, but there’s always room for improvement. Developing mental strength is about improving your ability to regulate your emotions, manage your thoughts, and behave in a positive manner, despite your circumstances. Just as there are those among us who are predisposed to develop physical strength more easily than others, mental strength seems to come more naturally to some people. There are several factors at play to determine the ease at which you develop mental strength: • Genetics—Genes play a role in whether or not you may be more prone to mental health issues, such as mood disorders. • Personality—Some people have personality traits that help them think more realistically and behave more positively by nature. • Experiences—Your life experiences influence how you think about yourself, other people, and the world in general. Obviously, you can’t change some of these factors. You can’t erase a bad childhood. You can’t help it if you are genetically predisposed to ADHD. But that doesn’t mean you can’t increase your mental strength. Anyone has the power to increase mental strength by devoting time and energy on the self-improvement exercises throughout this book. THE BASIS OF MENTAL STRENGTH Imagine a man who feels nervous about social situations. To minimize his anxiety, he avoids starting conversations with his coworkers. The less he speaks with his coworkers, the less they initiate conversation with him. When he enters the break room and passes people in the hallway without anyone speaking to him, he thinks, I must be socially awkward. The more he thinks about how awkward he is, the more nervous he feels about starting conversations. As his anxiety increases, his desire to avoid his coworkers also increases. This results in a self-perpetuating cycle. To understand mental strength, you have to learn how your thoughts, behaviors, and feelings are all intertwined, often working together to create a dangerous downward spiral as in the preceding example. This is why developing mental strength requires a three-pronged approach: 1. Thoughts—Identifying irrational thoughts and replacing them with more realistic thoughts. 2. Behaviors—Behaving in a positive manner despite the circumstances. 3. Emotions—Controlling your emotions so your emotions don’t control you. We hear it all the time: “Think positive.” But optimism alone isn’t enough to help you reach your full potential. CHOOSE BEHAVIOR BASED ON BALANCED EMOTIONS AND RATIONAL THINKING I’m terrified of snakes. Yet my fear is completely irrational. I live in Maine. We don’t have a single poisonous snake in the wild. I don’t see snakes very often, but when I do, my heart leaps into my throat and I’m tempted to run as fast as I can in the other direction. Usually, before I run away, I’m able to balance my sheer panic with rational thoughts that remind me that there’s no logical reason to feel afraid. Once my rational thinking kicks in, I can walk by the snake—as long as he’s a safe distance away. I still don’t want to pick him up or pet him, but I can continue past him without letting my irrational fear interfere with my day. We make our best decisions in life when we balance our emotions with rational thinking. Stop and think for a minute about how you behave when you’re really angry. It’s likely that you’ve said and done some things that you regretted later, because you were basing your actions on your emotions, not logic. But making choices based on rational thinking alone also doesn’t make for good decisions. We are human beings, not robots. Our hearts and our heads need to work together to control our bodies. Many of my clients question their ability to control their thoughts, emotions, and behavior. “I can’t help the way I feel,” they say. Or “I can’t get rid of the negative thoughts that run through my head,” and “I just can’t get motivated to do what I want to accomplish.” But with increased mental strength, it’s possible. THE TRUTH ABOUT MENTAL STRENGTH There’s a lot of misinformation and misconception about what it means to be mentally strong. Here are some of the truths about mental strength: • Being mentally strong isn’t about acting tough. You don’t have to become a robot or appear to have a tough exterior when you’re mentally strong. Instead, it’s about acting according to your values. • Mental strength doesn’t require you to ignore your emotions. Increasing your mental strength isn’t about suppressing your emotions; instead it’s about developing a keen awareness of them. It’s about interpreting and understanding how your emotions influence your thoughts and behavior. • You don’t have to treat your body like a machine to be mentally strong. Mental strength isn’t about pushing your body to its physical limits just to prove you can ignore pain. It’s about understanding your thoughts and feelings well enough that you can determine when to behave contrary to them, and when to listen to them. • Being mentally strong doesn’t mean you have to be completely self-reliant. Mental strength isn’t about proclaiming that you don’t ever need help from anyone or any type of higher power. Admitting you don’t have all the answers, asking for help when you need it, and acknowledging that you can gain strength from a higher power is a sign of a desire to grow stronger. • Being mentally strong is not about positive thinking. Thinking overly positive thoughts can be just as detrimental as thinking overly negative thoughts. Mental strength is about thinking realistically and rationally. • Developing mental strength isn’t about chasing happiness. Being mentally strong will help you to be more content in life, but it isn’t about waking up every day and trying to force yourself to feel happy. Instead, it’s about making the decisions that will help you reach your full potential. • Mental strength isn’t just the latest pop psychology trend. Just like the physical fitness world is filled with fad diets and fitness trends, the world of psychology is often filled with fleeting ideas about how to become your best self. Mental strength isn’t a trend. The psychology field has been helping people learn how to change their thoughts, feelings, and behavior since the 1960s. • Mental strength isn’t synonymous with mental health. While the healthcare industry often talks in terms of mental health versus mental illness, mental strength is different. Just like people can still be physically strong even if they have a physical health ailment like diabetes, you can still be mentally strong even if you have depression, anxiety, or other mental health problems. Having a mental illness doesn’t mean you’re destined to have bad habits. Instead, you can still choose to develop healthy habits. It may require more work, more focus, and more effort, but it’s very possible. THE BENEFITS OF MENTAL STRENGTH It’s often easy to feel mentally strong when life is going well, but at times problems arise. A job loss, a natural disaster, an illness in the family, or a death of a loved one is sometimes inevitable. When you’re mentally strong, you’ll be more prepared to deal with life’s challenges. Benefits of increasing your mental strength include: • Increased resilience to stress—Mental strength is helpful in everyday life, not just in the midst of a crisis. You’ll become better equipped to handle problems more efficiently and effectively, and it can reduce your overall stress level. • Improved life satisfaction—As your mental strength increases, your confidence will also increase. You’ll behave according to your values, which will give you peace of mind, and you’ll recognize what’s really important in your life. • Enhanced performance—Whether your goal is to be a better parent, to increase your productivity at the office, or to perform better on the athletic field, increasing your mental strength will help you reach your full potential. HOW TO DEVELOP MENTAL STRENGTH You’ll never become an expert at anything by simply reading a book. Athletes don’t become elite competitors after reading about their sport nor do top musicians increase their musical abilities by simply watching other performers play. They also have to practice. The following thirteen chapters aren’t meant to be a checklist that you either do or don’t do. They are a description of habits that everyone falls prey to sometimes. It’s meant to help you find better ways to cope with life’s challenges so you can avoid these pitfalls. It’s about growing, improving, and striving to become a little better than you were yesterday. OceanofPDF.com CHAPTER 1 THEY DON’T WASTE TIME FEELING SORRY FOR THEMSELVES Self-pity is easily the most destructive of the non-pharmaceutical narcotics; it is addictive, gives momentary pleasure and separates the victim from reality. —JOHN GARDNER During the weeks that followed Jack’s accident, his mother couldn’t stop talking about the “horrible incident.” Every day she recounted the story about how both of Jack’s legs were broken when he was hit by a school bus. She felt guilty that she wasn’t there to protect him, and seeing him in a wheelchair for several weeks was almost more than she could bear. Although doctors had predicted a complete recovery, she repeatedly warned Jack that his legs may never fully heal. She wanted him to be aware that he may not be able to play soccer or run around like the other kids ever again, just in case there was a problem. Although his doctors had medically cleared him to return to school, his parents decided that Jack’s mother would quit her job and homeschool him for the remainder of the year. They felt that seeing and hearing school buses each day might trigger too many bad memories. They also wanted to spare him from having to watch idly from his wheelchair as his friends played at recess. They hoped that staying home would help Jack heal faster, both emotionally and physically. Jack usually completed his homeschool work in the mornings and he spent his afternoons and evenings watching TV and playing video games. Within a few weeks, his parents noticed that his mood seemed to change. A normally upbeat and happy child, Jack became irritable and sad. His parents grew concerned that the accident may have traumatized him even more than they’d imagined. They pursued therapy in hopes it could help Jack deal with his emotional scars. Jack’s parents took him to a well-known therapist with expertise in childhood trauma. The therapist had received the referral from Jack’s pediatrician, so she knew a little bit about Jack’s experience prior to meeting him. When Jack’s mother wheeled him into the therapist’s office, Jack stared silently at the floor. His mother began by saying, “We’re having such a hard time since this terrible accident. It’s really ruined our lives and caused a lot of emotional problems for Jack. He’s just not the same little boy.” To his mother’s surprise, the therapist didn’t respond with sympathy. Instead she enthusiastically said, “Boy, have I been looking forward to meeting you, Jack! I’ve never met a kid who could beat a school bus! You have to tell me, how did you manage to get into a fight with a school bus and win?” For the first time since the accident Jack smiled. Over the next few weeks, Jack worked with his therapist on making his own book. He appropriately named it, How to Beat a School Bus. He created a wonderful story about how he managed to fight a school bus and escape with only a few broken bones. He embellished on the story by describing how he grabbed hold of the muffler, swung himself around, and protected the majority of his body from getting hit by the bus. Despite the exaggerated details, the main part of the story remained the same—he survived because he’s a tough kid. Jack concluded his book with a self-portrait. He drew himself sitting in a wheelchair wearing a superhero cape. The therapist included Jack’s parents in the treatment. She helped them see how fortunate they were that Jack survived with only a few broken bones. She encouraged his parents to stop feeling sorry for Jack. She recommended they treat him like a mentally and physically tough kid who was capable of overcoming great adversity. Even if his legs didn’t heal properly, she wanted them to focus on what Jack could still accomplish in life, not what the accident would prevent him from being able to do. The therapist and Jack’s parents worked with the school faculty and staff to prepare for Jack’s return to school. In addition to the special accommodations he’d need because he was still in a wheelchair, they wanted to ensure that the other students and teachers didn’t pity Jack. They arranged for Jack to share his book with his classmates so that he could tell them how he beat the school bus and show them that there was no reason to feel sorry for him. SELF-PITY PARTY We all experience pain and sorrow in life. And although sadness is a normal, healthy emotion, dwelling on your sorrow and misfortune is self-destructive. Do you respond positively to any of the points below? You tend to think your problems are worse than anyone else’s. If it weren’t for bad luck, you’re pretty sure you’d have none at all. Problems seem to add up for you at a much faster rate than anyone else. You’re fairly certain that no one else truly understands how hard your life really is. You sometimes choose to withdraw from leisure activities and social engagements so you can stay home and think about your problems. You’re more likely to tell people what went wrong during your day rather than what went well. You often complain about things not being fair. You struggle to find anything to be grateful for sometimes. You think that other people are blessed with easier lives. You sometimes wonder if the world is out to get you. Can you see yourself in some of the examples above? Self-pity can consume you until it eventually changes your thoughts and behaviors. But you can choose to take control. Even when you can’t alter your circumstances, you can alter your attitude. WHY WE FEEL SORRY FOR OURSELVES If self-pity is so destructive, why do we do it in the first place? And why is it sometimes so easy and even comforting to indulge in a pity party? Pity was Jack’s parents’ defense mechanism to protect their son and themselves from future dangers. They chose to remain focused on what he couldn’t do as a way to shield him from having to face any more potential problems. Understandably, they worried about his safety more than ever. They didn’t want him to be out of their sight. And they were concerned about the emotional reaction he might have to seeing a school bus again. It was only a matter of time before the pity poured on Jack turned into his own self-pity. It’s so easy to fall into the self-pity trap. As long as you feel sorry for yourself, you can delay any circumstances that will bring you face-to-face with your real fears, and you can avoid taking any responsibility for your actions. Feeling sorry for yourself can buy time. Instead of taking action or moving forward, exaggerating how bad your situation is justifies why you shouldn’t do anything to improve it. People often use self-pity as a way to gain attention. Playing the “poor me” card may result in some kind and gentle words from others—at least initially. For people who fear rejection, self-pity can be an indirect way of gaining help by sharing a woe-is-me tale in hopes it will attract some assistance. Unfortunately, misery loves company, and sometimes self-pity becomes a bragging right. A conversation can turn into a contest, with the person who has experienced the most trauma earning the badge of victory. Self-pity can also provide a reason to avoid responsibility. Telling your boss how bad your life is may stem from hopes that less will be expected from you. Sometimes self-pity becomes an act of defiance. It’s almost as if we assume that something will change if we dig in our heels and remind the universe that we deserve better. But that’s not how the world works. There isn’t a higher being—or a human being for that matter—who will swoop in and make sure we’re all dealt a fair hand in life. THE PROBLEM WITH FEELING SORRY FOR YOURSELF Feeling sorry for yourself is self-destructive. It leads to new problems and can have serious consequences. Instead of feeling grateful that Jack survived the accident, his parents worried about what the accident took away from them. As a result, they allowed the accident to take away even more. That’s not to say they weren’t loving parents. Their behavior stemmed from a desire to keep their son safe. However, the more they pitied Jack, the more negatively it affected his mood. Indulging in self-pity hinders living a full life in the following ways: • It’s a waste of time. Feeling sorry for yourself requires a lot of mental energy and does nothing to change the situation. Even when you can’t fix the problem, you can make choices to cope with life’s obstacles in a positive way. Feeling sorry for yourself won’t move you any closer to a solution. • It leads to more negative emotions. Once you allow it to take hold, self-pity will ignite a flurry of other negative emotions. It can lead to anger, resentment, loneliness, and other feelings that fuel more negative thoughts. • It can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Feelings of self-pity can lead to living a pitiful life. When you feel sorry for yourself, it’s unlikely you’ll perform at your best. As a result, you may experience more problems and increased failures, which will breed more feelings of self-pity. • It prevents you from dealing with other emotions. Self-pity gets in the way of dealing with grief, sadness, anger, and other emotions. It can stall your progress from healing and moving forward because self-pity keeps the focus on why things should be different rather than accepting the situation for what it is. • It causes you to overlook the good in your life. If five good things and one bad thing happen in a day, self-pity will cause you to focus only on the negative. When you feel sorry for yourself, you’ll miss out on the positive aspects of life. • It interferes with relationships. A victim mentality is not an attractive characteristic. Complaining about how bad your life is will likely wear on people rather quickly. No one ever says, “What I really like about her is the fact that she always feels sorry for herself.” STOP FEELING SORRY FOR YOURSELF Remember the three-pronged approach to achieving mental strength? To alleviate feelings of self-pity, you need to change your pitiful behavior and forbid yourself from indulging in pitiful thoughts. For Jack, this meant that he couldn’t spend all his time at home playing video games and watching TV. He needed to be around other kids his age and return to some of his previous activities that he was still able to do, like go to school. His parents also changed their thinking and began to view Jack as a survivor rather than a victim. Once they changed their thoughts about their son and the accident, they were able to exchange self-pity with gratitude. BEHAVE IN A MANNER THAT MAKES IT HARD TO FEEL SORRY FOR YOURSELF Four months after Lincoln died, his family and I were facing what should have been his twenty-seventh birthday. I had been dreading that day for weeks because I had no idea how we’d pass the time. My cartoon bubble pictured us sitting around in a circle sharing a box of Kleenex and talking about how unfair it was that he never reached his twenty-seventh birthday. When I finally worked up the courage to ask my mother-in-law how she planned to spend the day, without missing a beat she said, “What do you think about skydiving?” The best part was, she was serious. And, I had to admit, jumping out of a perfectly good airplane did seem like a much better idea than the pity party I’d imagined. It felt like the perfect way to honor Lincoln’s adventurous spirit. He’d always enjoyed meeting new people, going new places, and experiencing new things. It wasn’t unusual for him to head off on a spontaneous weekend trip, even if it meant he’d be flying the red-eye home and would have to go to work as soon as he stepped off the overnight flight. He’d say that one day of feeling tired at work was well worth the memories we’d created. Skydiving was something Lincoln would have loved to do so it seemed like an appropriate way to celebrate his life. It’s impossible to feel sorry for yourself when you’re jumping out of an airplane—unless of course, you don’t have a parachute. Not only did we have a great time, but our skydiving experience led to an annual tradition. Every year on Lincoln’s birthday, we choose to celebrate his love of life and adventure. It’s led to some interesting experiences—from swimming with sharks to riding mules into the Grand Canyon. We’ve even taken flying trapeze lessons. Each year, the whole family becomes involved in Lincoln’s birthday adventure. Some years, Lincoln’s grandmother watches from the sidelines with her camera, but two years ago, at the age of eighty-eight, she was first in line to go ziplining high above the trees. Even though I’m remarried, it’s a tradition we’ve continued, and my husband, Steve, even participates with us. It’s become a day we actually look forward to each year. Our choice to spend the day doing something enjoyable isn’t about ignoring our grief or masking our sadness. It’s about making a conscious choice to celebrate life’s gifts and refusing to behave in a pitiful manner. Instead of pitying ourselves for what we lost, we choose to feel grateful for what we had. When you notice self-pity creeping into your life, make a conscious effort to do something contrary to how you feel. You don’t have to jump out of a plane to ward off feelings of self-pity. Sometimes, small behavioral changes can make a big difference. Here are some examples: • Volunteer to help a worthy cause. It will take your mind off your problems and you can feel good that you’ve helped support someone else. It’s hard to feel sorry for yourself when you’re serving hungry people in a soup kitchen or spending time with elderly residents in a nursing home. • Perform a random act of kindness. Whether you mow the neighbor’s lawn or donate pet food to a local animal shelter, doing a good deed can help bring more meaning to your day. • Do something active. Physical or mental activity will help you focus on something other than your misfortune. Exercise, sign up for a class, read a book, or learn a new hobby, and your behavior change can help shift your attitude. The key to changing your feelings is finding which behaviors will extinguish your feelings of self-pity. Sometimes it’s a process of trial and error because the same behavioral change won’t work for everyone. If what you’re doing now isn’t working, try something new. If you never take a step in the right direction, you’ll stay right where you are. REPLACE THOUGHTS THAT ENCOURAGE SELF-PITY I once witnessed a fender bender in a grocery store parking lot. Two cars were backing up at the same time and their rear bumpers collided. The collision appeared to cause only minor damage to each vehicle. I watched as one driver jumped out of his vehicle and said, “Just what I needed. Why do these things always happen to me? As if I didn’t already have enough to deal with today!” Meanwhile, the other driver stepped out of his vehicle shaking his head. In a very calm voice he said, “Wow, we’re so lucky that no one got hurt. What a great day it is when you can get into an accident and walk away from it without a single injury.” Both men experienced the exact same event. However, their perception of the event was completely different. One man viewed himself as a victim of horrible circumstance while the other man viewed the event as good fortune. Their reaction was all about their differences in perception. You can view the events that happen in your life in many different ways. If you choose to view circumstances in a way that says, “I deserve better,” you’ll feel self-pity often. If you choose to look for the silver lining, even in a bad situation, you’ll experience joy and happiness much more often. Almost every situation has a silver lining. Ask any kid what the best part about having divorced parents is and most of them will say, “I get more presents at Christmas!” Obviously, there isn’t much good that arises from divorce, but getting twice as many presents is one small aspect of divorce that some kids rather enjoy. Reframing the way you look at a situation isn’t always easy, especially when you’re feeling like the host of your own pity party. Asking yourself the following questions can help change your negative thoughts into more realistic thoughts: • What’s another way I could view my situation? This is where the “glass half empty or glass half full” thinking comes in. If you’re looking at it from the glass-half-empty angle, take a moment to think about how someone looking from a glass-half-full perspective might view the same situation. • What advice would I give to a loved one who had this problem? Often, we’re better at handing out words of encouragement to other people rather than to ourselves. It’s unlikely you’d say to someone else, “You’ve got the worst life ever. Nothing ever goes right.” Instead, you’d hopefully offer some kind words of assistance such as, “You’ll figure out what to do, and you’ll make it through this. I know you will.” Take your own words of wisdom and apply them to your situation. • What evidence do I have that I can get through this? Feeling sorry for ourselves often stems from a lack of confidence in our ability to handle problems. We tend to think that we’ll never get through something. Remind yourself of times when you’ve solved problems and coped with tragedy in the past. Reviewing your skills, support systems, and past experiences can give you an extra boost of confidence that will help you stop feeling sorry for yourself. The more you indulge in thoughts that willfully delude yourself about your situation, the worse you’ll feel. Common thoughts that lead to feelings of self-pity include things such as: • I can’t handle one more problem. • Good things always happen to everyone else. • Bad things always happen to me. • My life just gets worse all the time. • No one else has to deal with this stuff. • I just can’t catch a break. You can choose to catch your negative thoughts before they spiral out of control. Though replacing overly negative thoughts with more realistic ones takes practice and hard work, it’s very effective in decreasing feelings of self-pity. If you think, Bad things always happen to me, create a list of good things that have happened to you as well. Then, replace your original thought with something more realistic like, Some bad things happen to me, but plenty of good things happen to me as well. This doesn’t mean you should turn something negative into an unrealistically positive affirmation. Instead, strive to find a realistic way to look at your situation. EXCHANGE SELF-PITY FOR GRATITUDE Marla Runyan is a very accomplished woman. She has a master’s degree, she’s written a book, and she’s competed in the Olympics. She even became the first American woman to finish the 2002 New York Marathon with an astounding time of 2 hours, 27 minutes. What makes Marla particularly extraordinary is that she’s accomplished all these feats despite the fact that she’s legally blind. At age nine, Marla was diagnosed with Stargardt’s disease, a form of macular degeneration that affects children. As her vision deteriorated, Marla discovered her love for running. Over the years, Marla has proved herself to be one of the fastest runners in the world, even though she’s never actually been able to see the finish line. Initially, Marla became an accomplished athlete in the Paralympics. She competed in 1992 and then again in 1996. Not only did she earn a total of five gold medals and one silver medal, she also set several world records. But Marla didn’t stop there. In 1999, she entered the Pan American Games and she won the 1,500-meter race. In 2000, she became the first legally blind athlete to ever compete in the Olympics. She was the first American to cross the finish line in the 1,500-meter race and she placed eighth overall. Marla doesn’t see her blindness as a disability. In fact, she chooses to view it as a gift that allows her to become successful in both long- and short-distance races. In discussing her blindness in her book, No Finish Line: My Life as I See It, Marla writes, “It not only has forced me to prove my competence but also pushed me to achieve. It has given me gifts, such as will and commitment that I use every day.” Marla doesn’t focus on what her vision loss took from her. Instead, she chooses to feel grateful for what her vision impairment actually gave her. While feeling sorry for yourself is about thinking I deserve better, gratitude is about thinking I have more than I deserve. Experiencing gratitude requires some extra effort, but it isn’t hard. Anyone can learn to become more grateful by developing new habits. Start to acknowledge other people’s kindness and generosity. Affirm the good in the world and you will begin to appreciate what you have. You don’t have to be rich, wildly successful, or have the perfect life to feel grateful. A person who earns 34,000 a year may think he doesn’t have much money but he is actually among the richest 1 percent of people in the world. If you’re reading this book, it means you’re more fortunate than the nearly one billion people in the world who can’t read, many of whom will be stuck in a life of poverty. Look for those little things in life that you can so easily take for granted and work toward increasing your feelings of gratitude. Here are a few simple habits that can help you focus on what you have to be grateful for: • Keep a gratitude journal. Each day write down at least one thing you’re grateful for. It could include being grateful for simple pleasures, like having clean air to breathe or seeing the sun shine, or major blessings like your job or family. • Say what you’re grateful for. If you aren’t likely to keep up with writing in a journal, make it a habit to say what you’re grateful for. Find one of life’s gifts to be grateful for each morning when you wake up and each night before you go to sleep. Say the words out loud, even if it’s just to yourself, because hearing the words of gratitude will increase your feelings of gratitude. • Change the channel when you’re experiencing self-pity. When you notice that you’re starting to feel sorry for yourself, shift your focus. Don’t allow yourself to continue thinking that life isn’t fair or that life should be different. Instead, sit down and list the people, circumstances, and experiences in life that you can be thankful for. If you keep a journal, refer to it and read it whenever self-pity begins to set in. • Ask others what they’re grateful for. Strike up conversations about gratitude to help you discover what other people feel thankful for. Hearing what others feel grateful for can remind you of more areas of your life that deserve gratitude. • Teach kids to be grateful. If you’re a parent, teaching your children to be grateful for what they have is one of the best ways to keep your own attitude in check. Make it a habit each day to ask your children what they’re grateful for. Have everyone in the family write down what they’re feeling grateful for and place it in a gratitude jar or hang it on a bulletin board. This will give your family a fun reminder to incorporate gratitude into your daily lives. GIVING UP SELF-PITY WILL MAKE YOU STRONGER Jeremiah Denton served as a U.S. naval aviator during the Vietnam War. In 1965, his plane was shot down and he was forced to eject from his aircraft. He was captured by the North Vietnamese and was taken as a prisoner of war. Commander Denton and the other officers maintained command over their fellow prisoners even as they were beaten, starved, and tortured on a daily basis. Commander Denton was often placed in solitary confinement for urging other prisoners to resist the North Vietnamese attempts to gain information from them. But that didn’t stop Commander Denton. He devised strategies to communicate with the other prisoners by using signs, tapping on walls, and coughing in sequence. Ten months after his capture, he was chosen to participate in a televised interview that was used as propaganda. While answering questions, he pretended as though the bright lights from the cameras were bothering his eyes as he began blinking T-O-R-T-U-R-E in Morse code to secretly send the message that he and his fellow prisoners were being mistreated by their captors. Throughout the interview, he continued to express his support for the U.S. government. He was released in 1973 after seven years in captivity. When he stepped off the plane as a free man, he said, “We are honored to have had the opportunity to serve our country under difficult circumstances. We are profoundly grateful to our commander in chief and to our nation for this day. God bless America.” After retiring from the military in 1977, he was elected to serve as senator for Alabama. Despite being placed in the worst circumstances imaginable, Jeremiah Denton didn’t waste time feeling sorry for himself. Instead, he maintained his composure and focused on doing whatever he could to manage the situation. Even when he was released, he chose to feel grateful that he was able to serve his country, rather than pity himself for the time he’d lost. Researchers studied the differences that occur when people focus on their burdens versus focusing on what they’re grateful for. Simply acknowledging a few things you feel grateful for each day is a powerful way to create change. In fact, gratitude not only impacts your psychological health, it can also affect your physical health. A 2003 study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology found: • People who feel gratitude don’t get sick as often as others. They have better immune systems and report fewer aches and pains. They have lower blood pressure and they exercise more often than the general population. They take better care of their health, sleep longer, and even report feeling more refreshed upon waking. • Gratitude leads to more positive emotions. People who feel grateful experience more happiness, joy, and pleasure on a daily basis. They even feel more awake and energetic. • Gratitude improves social lives. Grateful people are more willing to forgive others. They behave in a more outgoing fashion and feel less lonely and isolated. They are also more likely to help other people and to behave in a generous and compassionate manner. TROUBLESHOOTING AND COMMON TRAPS If you allow self-pity to take hold when you’re dealing with stress, you’ll put off working on a solution. Watch out for red flags that you’re allowing yourself to feel self-pity and take a proactive approach to change your attitude at the first sign of feeling sorry for yourself. WHAT’S HELPFUL Giving yourself a reality check so you don’t exaggerate how bad the situation really is Replacing overly negative thoughts about your situation with more realistic thoughts Choosing to actively problem-solve and work on improving your situation Getting active and behaving in a way that makes you less likely to feel sorry for yourself, even when you don’t feel like it Practicing gratitude every day WHAT’S NOT HELPFUL Allowing yourself to believe that your life is worse than most other people’s lives Indulging in exaggeratedly negative thoughts about how difficult your life is Remaining passive about the situation and focusing only on how you feel, rather than what you can do Declining to participate in experiences and activities that could help you feel better Staying focused on what you don’t have rather than what you do have OceanofPDF.com CHAPTER 2 THEY DON’T GIVE AWAY THEIR POWER When we hate our enemies, we are giving them power over us: power over our sleep, our appetites, our blood pressure, our health, and our happiness. —DALE CARNEGIE Lauren was convinced her overbearing, meddling mother-in-law was going to ruin her marriage, if not her entire life. Although she had thought her mother-in-law, Jackie, was annoying in the past, it wasn’t until she and her husband had two children together that she found her to be unbearable. Jackie usually made several unannounced visits each week, and she often stayed for several hours at a time. Lauren found those visits to be intrusive on their family time because she only had so much time with her girls between the time she came home from work and the time they went to bed. But what really bothered Lauren was the way Jackie always tried to undermine her authority with the girls. Jackie would often say things to the children like “You know, a little TV won’t hurt you. I don’t know why your mother always says you can’t watch it” or “I’d let you have dessert but your mother’s convinced sugar is bad for your health.” She sometimes lectured Lauren about her “new age parenting” and reminded her that she allowed her children to watch TV and eat sweets and they seemed to turn out just fine. Lauren always responded to Jackie’s comments with a polite nod and a smile, but on the inside, she was seething. She grew resentful toward Jackie and she often took it out on her husband. But whenever Lauren complained to her husband about his mother, he’d say something like “Well, you know how she is,” or “Just ignore her comments. She means well.” Lauren found comfort in complaining to her girlfriends who had affectionately named Jackie the “monster-in-law.” But one week, everything seemed to come to a head when Jackie suggested Lauren should start exercising more because she looked like she had gained a little weight. That comment pushed Lauren over the edge. She stormed out of the house and spent the night at her sister’s. The next day, she still didn’t feel ready to go home. She was afraid she’d have to hear a lecture from Jackie about how she shouldn’t have left. It was at that point Lauren knew she had to get help or her marriage might be in jeopardy. Lauren initially sought counseling to learn anger management skills to help her respond less angrily to her mother-in-law’s comments. However, after a few therapy sessions, she was able to see that she needed to work on being more proactive in preventing problems, not just less reactive toward Jackie’s comments. I asked Lauren to complete a pie chart that showed how much time and energy she focused on various areas of her life, such as work, sleep, leisure, family, and time with her mother-in-law. I then asked her to complete a second pie chart that showed how many hours she physically spent doing each activity. When she was done with the second pie chart, she was surprised to see how much her time and energy were out of proportion. Although she only physically spent about five hours a week with her mother-in-law, she was devoting at least an additional five hours thinking and talking about her disdain for her. This exercise helped her see how she was giving her mother-in-law power over many areas of her life. When she could have devoted her energy to nurturing her relationship with her husband or caring for her children, she was often thinking about how much she disliked Jackie. Once Lauren recognized how much power she was giving Jackie, she chose to start making some changes. She worked with her husband on setting healthy boundaries for their family. Together, they established rules that would help them limit the influence Jackie had on their family. They told Jackie that she could no longer make unannounced visits several times per week. Instead, they would invite her over for dinner when they wanted to visit with her. They also informed her that she could no longer undermine Lauren’s authority as a mother, and if she did, she’d be asked to leave. Lauren also chose to stop complaining about Jackie. She recognized that venting to her friends and her husband only fueled her frustration and wasted her time and energy. Slowly, but surely, Lauren began to feel like she was getting her life and her house back. She no longer dreaded Jackie’s visits once she recognized she didn’t have to tolerate rude or disrespectful behavior in her home. Instead, she could control what went on under her own roof. EMPOWERING OTHER PEOPLE TO HAVE POWER OVER YOU Giving other people the power to control how you think, feel, and behave makes it impossible to be mentally strong. Do any of the points below sound familiar? You feel deeply offended by any criticism or negative feedback you receive, regardless of the source. Other people have the ability to make you feel so angry that you say and do things you later regret. You’ve changed your goals based on what other people have told you that you should be doing with your life. The type of day you’re going to have depends on how other people behave. When other people try to guilt you into doing something, you reluctantly do it, even if you don’t want to. You work hard to ensure other people see you in a positive light because much of your self-worth depends on how others perceive you. You spend a lot of time complaining about people and circumstances that you don’t like. You often complain about all the things you “have to” do in life. You go to great lengths to avoid uncomfortable emotions, like embarrassment or sadness. You have difficulty setting boundaries, but then feel resentful toward people who take up your time and energy. You hold a grudge when someone offends you or hurts you. Can you see yourself in any of the above examples? Retaining your power is about being confident in who you are and the choices you make, despite the people around you and the circumstances you’re in. WHY WE GIVE AWAY OUR POWER Lauren was clear that she really wanted to be a nice person, and she thought that being a good wife meant tolerating her mother-in-law at all costs. She felt it would be disrespectful to ask her mother-in-law not to come over and she was hesitant to speak up when her feelings were hurt. She’d been raised to “turn the other cheek” when someone treated her poorly. But with help, she was able to see that setting healthy boundaries wasn’t being mean or disrespectful. Instead, setting limits on what was allowed in her own home was healthy for her family and less taxing on her mental strength. Anytime you don’t set healthy emotional and physical boundaries for yourself, you risk giving away your power to other people. Perhaps you don’t dare say no when your neighbor asks for a favor. Or maybe you dread receiving a phone call from a friend who constantly complains, but you continue to pick up on the first ring. Each time you avoid saying no to something you really don’t want, you give away your power. If you don’t make any attempt to get your needs met, you’ll give people permission to take things away from you. A lack of emotional boundaries can be equally problematic. If you don’t like the way someone treats you, yet you don’t stand up for yourself, you give that person power over your life. THE PROBLEM WITH GIVING AWAY YOUR POWER Lauren allowed her mother-in-law to control what sort of an evening she was going to have. If Jackie showed up, Lauren felt angry and bitter about the fact that she wasn’t getting to spend quality time with her children. On the days Jackie didn’t come to her home, Lauren felt much more relaxed. She allowed Jackie’s behavior to interfere with her relationship with her children, as well as her marriage. Instead of spending her spare time talking to her husband and her friends about enjoyable subjects, she wasted her energy complaining about Jackie. She even found herself sometimes volunteering to work late because she wasn’t excited about going home when she knew Jackie was going to be there. The longer she gave her power to Jackie, the more helpless she became about fixing it. There are many problems with giving away your power: • You depend on others to regulate your feelings. When you give away your power, you become completely dependent upon other people and external circumstances to regulate your emotions. Life often becomes like a roller coaster—when things are going well, you’ll feel good; but when your circumstances change, your thoughts, feelings, and behavior will shift. • You let other people define your self-worth. If you give others the power to determine your self-worth, you’ll never feel worthy enough. You’ll only be as good as someone else’s opinion of you and you will never be able to receive enough praise or positive feedback to meet your needs if you depend on others to feel good about yourself. • You avoid addressing the real problem. Giving away your power lends itself to helplessness. Rather than focus on what you can do to improve the situation, you’ll find an excuse to justify your problems. • You become a victim of your circumstances. You’ll become a passenger in your own life rather than a driver. You’ll say other people make you feel bad or force you to behave in a manner you don’t like. You’ll blame others instead of accepting responsibility for your choices. • You become highly sensitive to criticism. You’ll lack the ability to evaluate criticism. Instead, you’ll take anything anyone says to heart. You’ll give much more power to other people’s words than those words deserve. • You lose sight of your goals. You won’t be able to build the kind of life you want when you allow other people to be in control of your goals. You can’t work toward your goals successfully when you give other people the power to get in your way and interfere with your progress. • You ruin relationships. If you don’t speak up when people hurt your feelings or you allow them to infringe on your life in an unwelcomed manner, you’ll likely grow resentful toward them. RECLAIM YOUR POWER Without confidence in who you are, your entire self-worth may depend on how others feel about you. What if you offend people? What if they don’t like you anymore? If you choose to put up healthy boundaries, you may receive some backlash. But if you have a strong enough sense of self-worth, you’ll learn that you can tolerate the repercussions. Lauren learned that she could be firm with her mother-in-law, while still behaving respectfully. Although she was terrified of confrontation, Lauren and her husband explained their concerns to Jackie together. Initially, Jackie was offended when they told her she could not come over every night. And Jackie tried to argue when they explained that she would not be allowed to make rude comments about Lauren’s rules for the children. But, over time, Jackie accepted that she had to follow these rules if she wanted to come into their home. IDENTIFY PEOPLE WHO HAVE TAKEN YOUR POWER Steven McDonald is an incredible example of someone who chose not to give away his power. While working as a New York City police officer in 1986, Officer McDonald stopped to question some teenagers about some recent bicycle thefts. One of the fifteen-year-olds in question took out a gun and shot Officer McDonald in the head and neck. The shots paralyzed him from the neck down. Miraculously, Officer McDonald survived. He spent eighteen months in the hospital recuperating and learning how to live as a quadriplegic. At the time of the accident, he’d only been married eight months, and his wife was six months pregnant. Remarkably, Officer McDonald and his wife chose not to focus on all that had been taken away from them by this teenage boy. Instead, they made a conscious choice to forgive him. In fact, a few years after his injury, the officer’s assailant called him from jail to apologize. Officer McDonald not only accepted his apology, but he also told him that he hoped someday they could travel the country together sharing their story with the hope they could prevent other acts of violence. Officer McDonald never got the chance to do that, however, because three days after his assailant was released from prison, the young man was killed in a motorcycle accident. So Officer McDonald set out on his mission to spread his message about peace and forgiveness on his own. “The only thing worse than a bullet in my spine would have been to nurture revenge in my heart,” he says in the book Why Forgive? He may have lost his physical mobility in that attack, but he didn’t give that violent incident or his assailant the power to ruin his life. He’s now a highly sought after speaker who teaches love, respect, and forgiveness. Officer McDonald is an inspirational example of someone who, despite being the victim of a senseless act of violence, chose not to waste time giving his assailant more power. Choosing to forgive someone who has hurt you, either emotionally or physically, doesn’t mean you have to excuse the other person’s behavior, but letting go of your anger frees you to focus your energy on a more worthwhile cause. If you’ve spent most of your life feeling like a victim of your circumstances, it takes hard work to recognize that you have the power to choose your own path in life. The first step is to develop self-awareness by identifying when you blame external circumstances and other people for how you think, feel, and behave. Take a close look at the people you are devoting your time and energy toward. Are they the people you want to receive it? If not, you may be giving them more power than you think they deserve. Each second you spend commiserating with coworkers about how unfair your boss is, you are giving your boss more power. Every time you tell your friends how controlling your mother-in-law is, you give her a little more power over you. Resolve to stop giving people your time and energy if you don’t want them to play a big role in your life. REFRAME YOUR LANGUAGE Sometimes retaining your power means changing the way you look at the situation. Examples of language that indicates you’re giving away your power include: • “My boss makes me so mad.” You may not like your boss’s behavior, but does he really make you feel angry? Perhaps your boss behaves in a manner that you don’t like and it may influence how you feel, but he’s not forcing you to feel anything. • “My boyfriend left me because I’m not good enough.” Are you really not good enough or is that just one person’s opinion? If you took a poll of a hundred people, it’s not likely that they’d all come to that same consensus. Just because one person thinks something, it doesn’t make it true. Don’t give one person’s opinion of you the power to determine who you are. • “My mom makes me feel really bad about myself because she’s always so critical of me.” As an adult, are you obligated to listen to your mother make critical statements about you over and over? Just because she makes comments you don’t like, does it really have to lower your self-esteem? • “I have to invite my in-laws over for dinner every Sunday night.” Do your in-laws really force you to do that or is that a choice you make because it’s important to your family? THINK BEFORE YOU REACT Rachel brought her sixteen-year-old daughter to me for therapy because her daughter refused to listen to her. No matter what she told her daughter to do, she just wouldn’t do it. I asked Rachel how she reacted when her daughter refused to follow her directions. Out of exasperation, she told me, she yelled and argued with her. Each time her daughter said, “No!,” Rachel yelled, “Do it!” Rachel didn’t realize it, but she was giving her daughter a lot of power. Every minute that she argued with her daughter was one more minute her daughter could put off cleaning her room. Each time she lost her temper, Rachel gave away some of her power. Instead of controlling her daughter’s behavior, Rachel was giving her daughter power to control her. If someone says something you don’t like, and you yell or begin to argue, you give those words you don’t like even more power. Make a conscious choice to think about how you want to behave before you react to other people. Every time you lose your cool, you give that other person your power. Here are some strategies to help you stay calm when you’re tempted to react negatively: • Take deep breaths. Frustration and anger cause physical reactions within the body—an increased rate of breathing, an elevated heart rate, and sweating to name a few. Taking slow, deep breaths can relax your muscles and decrease the physiological response, which in turn can decrease your emotional reactivity. • Excuse yourself from the situation. The more emotional you feel, the less rational you’ll think. Learn to recognize your personal warning signs of anger—such as shaking or feeling flushed—and remove yourself from the situation before you lose your cool. This may mean saying, “I am not willing to talk about that right now,” or it may mean walking away. • Distract yourself. Don’t try solving a problem or addressing an issue with someone when you’re feeling overly emotional. Instead, distract yourself with an activity, like walking or reading, to help you calm down. Getting your mind off what’s bothering you, even for a few minutes, can help you calm down so you can think more rationally. EVALUATE FEEDBACK CRITICALLY Not long before she released an album that sold over ten million copies, Madonna received a rejection letter from the president of Millennium Records that said, “The only thing missing from this project is the material.” Had Madonna allowed that letter to define her singing and songwriting abilities, she might have given up. But fortunately, she kept looking for opportunities in the music industry. Soon after that rejection letter, she landed a record deal that launched her career. Within a couple of decades, Madonna was recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as the bestselling female recording artist of all time. She holds numerous other records, including the top-touring female artist of all time, and she’s ranked second on the Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists—second only to the Beatles. Almost every successful person likely has a similar story of rejection. In 1956, Andy Warhol tried to give one of his paintings to the Museum of Modern Art, but they declined to accept it even for free. Fast-forward to 1989, and his paintings had become so successful that he earned his own museum. The Andy Warhol Museum is the largest museum in the United States dedicated to a single artist. Clearly, everyone has an opinion, but successful people don’t allow one person’s opinion to define them. Retaining your power is about evaluating feedback to determine if it has any validity. While criticism can sometimes open our eyes to how others perceive us so we can make positive change—a friend points out a bad habit, or a spouse helps you see your selfish behavior—at other times, criticism is a reflection of the critic. Angry people may choose to offer harsh criticism quite regularly just because it relieves their stress. Or individuals with low self-esteem may feel better about themselves only when they put other people down. So it’s important to really consider the source before making any decisions about how you want to proceed. When you receive criticism or feedback from others, wait a beat before responding. If you’re upset or emotionally reactive, take the time to calm down. Then ask yourself these questions: • What evidence is there that this is true? For example, if your boss says you are lazy, look for evidence of times when you haven’t worked very hard. • What evidence do I have this isn’t true? Look for times when you have put in a lot of effort and have been a hard worker. • Why might this person be giving me this feedback? Take a step back and see if you can find out why this person may be giving you negative feedback. Is it based on the small sampling of your behavior that the person has witnessed? For example, if your boss only watched you work on a day where you were coming down with the flu, she may decide that you aren’t very productive. Her conclusion may not be accurate. • Do I want to change any of my behavior? There may be times where you choose to change your behavior because you agree with the other person’s criticism. For example, if your boss says you’re lazy, maybe you’ll decide that you haven’t been putting in as much effort at the office as you could. So you decide to start showing up early and staying late because it’s important to you to be a good worker. Just remember, though, that your boss isn’t forcing you to do anything different. You are choosing to create change because you want to, not because you have to. Keep in mind that one person’s opinion of you doesn’t make it true. You can respectfully choose to disagree and move on without devoting time and energy into trying to change the other person’s mind. RECOGNIZE YOUR CHOICES There are very few things in life you have to do, but often we convince ourselves we don’t have a choice. Instead of saying, “I have to go to work tomorrow,” remind yourself that it’s a choice. If you choose not to go to work, there will be consequences. Perhaps you won’t get paid. Or maybe you’ll risk losing your job altogether. But it’s a choice. Simply reminding yourself that you have a choice in everything you do, think, and feel can be very freeing. If you’ve spent most of your life feeling like a victim of your circumstances, it takes hard work to recognize that you have the power to create the kind of life you want to live. TAKING BACK YOUR POWER WILL MAKE YOU STRONGER You don’t get to be named one of the most powerful people in the world by giving away your power. Just ask Oprah Winfrey. She grew up in extreme poverty and was sexually abused by several people throughout her childhood. She bounced between living with her mother, father, and grandmother, and as a teenager, she frequently ran away from home. She became pregnant at age fourteen, but the infant died shortly after birth. During her high school years, she began working at a local radio station. She worked her way through several media jobs, and eventually, she landed a job as a TV news anchor. But she was later fired from the position. She didn’t allow one person’s opinion of her on-air suitability to stop her, however. She went on to create her own talk show and by the age of thirty-two, her show became a national hit. By the age of forty-one, she had a reported net worth of over 340 million. Oprah has started her own magazine, radio show, and TV network and has coauthored five books. She’s even won an Academy Award. She’s started a multitude of charities to help people in need, including a leadership academy for girls in South Africa. Oprah didn’t let her childhood or her former employer take away her power. A woman who was once teased because she was so poor she wore potato sacks as dresses was named one of the world’s most powerful women by both CNN and Time. Statistically, her upbringing would have predicted a poor prognosis. But Oprah refused to be a statistic. She chose to define who she was going to be in life by not giving away her power. When you decide that no one else has the power to control how you feel, you’ll experience empowerment. Here are some other ways how retaining your power will help you become mentally strong: • You’ll develop a better sense of who you are when you’re able to make choices based on what’s best for you instead of what will prevent the most repercussions. • When you take responsibility for your own behavior, you’ll become accountable for your progress toward your goals. • You will never be pressured into doing something that you don’t want to do based on guilt trips or what you think other people want you to do. • You’ll be able to devote your time and energy to things you choose. You won’t have to blame other people for wasting your time or ruining your day. • Retaining your personal power reduces your risk of depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues. Many mental health problems are linked to a sense of hopelessness and helplessness. When you decide not to give other people and external circumstances the power to control how you feel and behave, you gain more power over your mental health. When you hold a grudge, those feelings of anger and resentment do nothing to lessen the other person’s life. Instead, harboring anger and resentment gives that person more power to interfere with your quality of life. Choosing to forgive allows you to take back your power, not just over your psychological health, but also over your physical health. Research shows some of the health benefits of forgiveness include the following: • Forgiveness reduces your stress. Over the years, many studies have shown that holding a grudge keeps your body in a state of stress. When you practice forgiveness, your blood pressure and heart rate decrease. • Choosing to forgive increases your tolerance to pain. In a 2005 study of patients with chronic low back pain, anger increased psychological distress and decreased a person’s tolerance to pain. A willingness to forgive was associated with increased pain tolerance. • Unconditional forgiveness can help you to live longer. A 2012 study published in the Journal of Behavioral Medicine discovered that when people were only willing to forgive others under certain conditions—like the other person apologized or promised to never repeat the same behavior—their risk of dying early actually increased. You don’t have any control over whether someone will apologize. Waiting to forgive people until they say they’re sorry gives them control over not just your life, but perhaps even your death. TROUBLESHOOTING AND COMMON TRAPS Monitor your personal power and look for ways in which you are voluntarily giving it away. It takes hard work, but increasing your mental strength requires you to retain every ounce of personal power for yourself. WHAT’S HELPFUL Using language that acknowledges your choice such as, “I’m choosing to . . .” Setting healthy emotional and physical boundaries with people Behaving proactively by making conscious choices about how you’ll respond to others Taking full responsibility for how you choose to spend your time and energy Choosing to forgive individuals regardless of whether they seek to make amends Willingness to examine feedback and criticism without jumping to conclusions WHAT’S NOT HELPFUL Using language that implies you’re a victim, such as “I have to do this,” or “My boss makes me so mad” Feeling anger and resentment toward people you allow to infringe on your rights Reacting to others and then blaming them for the way you handled yourself Doing things you don’t want to do and then blaming others for “making” you do it Choosing to hold a grudge and harbor anger and resentment Allowing feedback and criticism to control how you feel about yourself OceanofPDF.com CHAPTER 3 THEY DON’T SHY AWAY FROM CHANGE It’s not that some people have willpower and some don’t . . . It’s that some people are ready to change and others are not. —JAMES GORDON Richard entered my therapy office because he wasn’t making much progress in managing his physical health. At the age of forty-four, he was seventy-five pounds overweight and had recently been diagnosed with diabetes. Shortly after his diagnosis, he’d met with a nutritionist and learned about the diet changes he’d need to make to lose weight and manage his blood sugar. Initially, he tried eliminating all the junk food he had always eaten so regularly. He’d gone so far as to throw away all the ice cream, cookies, and sugary soft drinks he had in his home. But within two days, he found himself buying more sweets and resorting to his old habits. He was also aware that he’d need to increase his activity level if he wanted to get healthier. After all, he was no stranger to exercise. Back in high school, he’d been a star athlete on the football field and the basketball court. But these days, he spent the majority of his time sitting behind a computer. He worked long hours and wasn’t sure how he’d find the time to exercise. He’d purchased a gym membership, but he’d only gone to the gym twice. He usually came home from work exhausted, and he already felt like he wasn’t spending enough time with his wife and children. Richard told me that he really wanted to get healthier. But he felt frustrated. Despite understanding the risks of being overweight and the dangers of not managing his diabetes, he just couldn’t motivate himself to change his unhealthy habits. It was clear that he was trying to change too much too fast, which is a recipe for failure. I recommended he choose one thing to change at a time and for the first week, he said he’d give up the cookies he usually ate at his desk during the afternoon. It was important to find something to replace that habit with—and he decided he would try snacking on carrot sticks instead. I also recommended he gain support to help him become healthier. He agreed to attend a diabetes support group. And over the next few weeks we discussed strategies to help get his family involved. His wife attended a few therapy sessions with him, and she began to understand steps she could take to help Richard improve his health. She agreed not to buy as much junk food when she went grocery shopping, and she began working with Richard on finding healthier recipes for their meals. We also discussed a realistic exercise schedule. Richard said that almost every day he left the house planning to go to the gym after work, but he always talked himself out of it and went straight home. We decided he’d start by going to the gym three days a week and he scheduled those three days ahead of time. He also kept a list of all the reasons why going to the gym was a good idea in the car. On the days when he began thinking that he should just go home instead of going to the gym, he read over his list as a reminder about why going to the gym was the best choice, even if he didn’t feel like it. Over the next two months, Richard began losing weight. But his blood sugar was still fairly high. He admitted that he was still eating a lot of junk food in the evenings while he watched TV. I encouraged him to find ways to make it less convenient for him to reach for sugary snacks, so he decided that he’d keep the sweet treats downstairs in the basement. Then, when he wandered into the kitchen in the evenings, he’d be more likely to reach for a healthy snack. If he still wanted cookies, he’d have to think about whether he wanted to go down to the basement to get them and most of the time, he found that he was more motivated to reach for a healthier snack. As soon as he started making progress, he found it easier to make more changes. Eventually, he was able to feel more inspired to lose weight and manage his blood sugar. TO CHANGE OR NOT TO CHANGE Although it’s often easy to say you want to change, successfully making a change is hard. Our thoughts and emotions often prevent us from creating behavioral change, even when it will improve our lives. Many people shy away from making changes that can drastically improve their lives. See if any of the following apply to you: You tend to justify a bad habit by convincing yourself what you’re doing isn’t “that bad.” You experience a lot of anxiety about changes to your routine. Even when you’re in a bad situation, you worry that making a change might make things worse. Whenever you attempt to make a change, you struggle to stick with it. When your boss, family, or friends make changes that affect you, it’s difficult for you to adapt. You think a lot about making changes but put off doing anything different until later. You worry that any changes you make aren’t likely to last. The thought of stepping outside your comfort zone just seems too scary. You lack the motivation to create positive change because it’s too hard. You make excuses for why you can’t change, like “I’d like to exercise more, but my spouse doesn’t want to go with me.” You have difficulty recalling the last time you purposely tried to challenge yourself to become better. You hesitate to do anything new because it just seems like too big of a commitment. Do any of the above examples sound familiar? Although circumstances can change quickly, humans often change at a much slower pace. Choosing to do something different requires you to adapt your thinking and your behavior, which will likely bring up some uncomfortable emotions. But that doesn’t mean you should shy away from change. WHY WE SHY AWAY FROM CHANGE Initially, Richard tried to change too much too fast and he quickly became overwhelmed. Whenever he thought, This is going to be too hard, he allowed himself to give up. As soon as he began seeing some positive results, however, his thoughts became more positive and it was easier for him to stay motivated. Many people shy away from change because they think that doing something different is too risky or uncomfortable. TYPES OF CHANGE We can experience different types of change, some you might find easier than others: • All-or-nothing change—Some changes are incremental while others are basically all or nothing. Deciding to have a child, for example, isn’t something you can do in steps. Once you have that baby, your life has irrevocably changed. • Habit change—You can choose to either get rid of bad habits, like sleeping too late, or you can choose to create good habits, like exercising five times a week. Most habit changes allow you to try something new for a little while, but you can always revert back to your old habits. • Trying-something-new change—Change sometimes involves trying something new or mixing up your daily routine, like volunteering at a hospital or taking violin lessons. • Behavioral change—Sometimes there are behavioral changes that don’t necessarily constitute a habit. For example, maybe you want to commit to going to all of your child’s sports games or maybe you want to behave friendlier. • Emotional change—Not all change is tangible. Sometimes it’s emotional. For example, if you want to feel less irritable all the time, you’ll need to examine the thoughts and behaviors that contribute to your irritability. • Cognitive change—There may be ways in which you want to change your thinking as well. Perhaps you want to think less about the past or maybe decrease worrisome thoughts. READINESS FOR CHANGE New Year’s resolutions are commonly broken, because we try to make changes based on a date and not because we’re really ready. And if you aren’t ready to create change, you likely won’t be successful at maintaining it. Even changing one small habit, like deciding you’ll floss your teeth every day or giving up your bedtime snack, requires a certain level of commitment. THE FIVE STAGES OF CHANGE 1. Precontemplation—When people are precontemplative, they don’t yet identify any need to change. Richard was precontemplative about making any changes to his health for years. He avoided going to the doctor, he refused to step on a scale, and he dismissed any comments his wife made when she expressed concern about his health. 2. Contemplation—People who are actively contemplative are considering the pros and cons of making a change. When I first saw Richard, he was contemplative. He was aware that not changing his eating habits could have serious consequences, but he was also not yet certain how to go about creating change. 3. Preparation—This is the stage where people prepare to make a change. They establish a plan with concrete steps that identify what they are going to do differently. Once Richard moved into the preparation stage, he scheduled days to work out and chose one snack to swap for something healthier. 4. Action—This is where the concrete behavioral change takes place. Richard started going to the gym and swapped his afternoon cookies for carrots. 5. Maintenance—This often overlooked step is essential. Richard needed to plan ahead so he could maintain his lifestyle changes when he faced obstacles, like holidays or vacations. FEAR When I met Andrew, he was stuck in a low-paying job that didn’t challenge him. He had a college degree—and the student loans to prove it—but he was working in a field that didn’t use any of his skills. There was little opportunity for advancement. A few months prior to our first session, he’d gotten into a car accident. Not only was his car totaled, but he’d racked up some hefty medical bills. He was underinsured in terms of both his health and his vehicle, and he was experiencing serious financial problems. Despite feeling a lot of stress about his financial situation, Andrew was afraid to apply for new jobs. He worried that he might not like a different job, and he lacked confidence in his skills. He also dreaded the thought of getting used to a new office, a new boss, and different coworkers. I helped Andrew examine the pros and cons of a job change. Once Andrew developed a budget, he was able to examine the facts of the situation. Staying at his current job would make it impossible to pay for his bills each month. Even without a single unexpected expense, he would be at least 200 shy of paying his bills. Facing this reality gave Andrew the motivation he needed to begin applying for new jobs. The fear of not being able to pay his bills had to outweigh the fear of getting a new job that paid better. Just like Andrew, many people worry that doing something different may make things even worse. Maybe you don’t like the house you’re living in, but you worry that a new home could have even bigger problems. Or maybe you worry about ending a relationship because you are afraid you won’t ever find anyone better. So you convince yourself to keep things the same, even if you’re not happy. AVOIDING DISCOMFORT Many people associate change with discomfort. And often, they underestimate their ability to tolerate the discomfort that accompanies a behavioral change. Richard knew what changes he needed to make to improve his health, but he didn’t want to give up foods he liked or feel the pain that accompanies a workout. And he worried that losing weight meant he’d have to be hungry. He dreaded all those realities, but he didn’t realize that these slight discomforts were just that, and nothing worse. It wasn’t until he began gaining confidence in his ability to tolerate discomfort that he truly felt like making further changes. GRIEF Tiffany came to therapy because she wanted to change her spending habits. Her shopping had become out of control, and she felt stressed because she was carrying around huge credit card balances. She didn’t want to keep spending but at the same time, she didn’t want to change. When we discussed some of her concerns about what would happen if she tried to stick to a budget, she discovered that she didn’t want to give up time with her friends, because she and her girlfriends often spent Saturday afternoons shopping together. She thought the only way to curb her spending meant giving up time with her friends, which she feared would lead to loneliness. Doing something different means giving something up. And there’s often a grief associated with leaving something behind. To spare ourselves this grief, we can convince ourselves not to change. Tiffany would have rather held on to her girls’ day at the mall than avoid financial ruin. THE PROBLEM WITH SHYING AWAY FROM CHANGE Shying away from change can have serious consequences. In Richard’s case, continuing his current habits would likely take a serious toll on his health. The longer he delayed making change, the more irreversible damage he was likely to suffer. But avoiding change doesn’t always have just physical consequences. Remaining stagnant can also interfere with personal growth in other areas of your life. • Staying the same often equals getting stuck in a rut. Life can get pretty boring if you don’t do anything differently. A person who simply decides to keep things as mundane and low-key as possible isn’t likely to experience a rich, full life and might become depressed. • You won’t learn new things. The world will change with or without you. Don’t think that your choice not to change will prevent anyone else from embracing change. You’ll risk being left in the dust if you choose to keep doing everything the same for the rest of your life. • Your life may not get better. If you don’t change, you can’t make your life better. Many problems that are waiting to be solved require you to do something different. But if you aren’t willing to try something new, those issues are likely to remain unresolved. • You won’t challenge yourself to develop healthier habits. It’s easy to develop bad habits. Breaking bad habits requires a willingness to try something new. • Other people will outgrow you. “My husband isn’t the same man I married thirty years ago.” I hear this all the time in my office, and my response is usually, “Let’s hope not.” I hope everyone grows and changes over the course of thirty years. If you are unwilling to challenge yourself and improve, others may grow bored with you. • The longer you wait the harder it gets. Do you think it’s easier to quit smoking after your first cigarette or after twenty years of smoking? The longer you keep the same habits, the harder they can be to break. Sometimes people put off change until the right time. They say things like “I’ll look for a new job when things calm down” or “I’ll worry about losing weight after the holidays.” But, often, the perfect time to do something never arises. The longer change gets delayed, the harder it is to do. ACCEPT CHANGE I first learned of Mary Deming from one of her close friends who couldn’t stop saying enough good things about her. And when I heard Mary’s story, I began to understand why. But it wasn’t until I spoke with her that it truly hit me. When Mary was eighteen, her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. Three short years later, her mother passed away. Following her mother’s death, Mary admits she buried her head in the sand. She says she vacillated between feeling sorry for herself—her father had passed away when she was a teen so she felt it was unfair she was an “orphan” at 21—and busying herself with as much activity as possible so she didn’t have to face the reality of her situation. But in 2000, at the age of fifty—the same age her father had been when he passed away—Mary began thinking about her own mortality. That same year, as a high school teacher, Mary was asked to chaperone a school-sponsored fund-raiser for cancer research. Chaperoning that event provided Mary with an opportunity to meet with other people who had lost loved ones to cancer and the fund-raiser ignited her passion to make a difference. She began participating in fund-raising events for cancer research. Initially, she joined the American Cancer Society’s “Relay for Life” as her first fund-raiser walk. Then, in 2008, she joined the three-day sixty-mile walk sponsored by Susan G. Komen that was specifically aimed at raising money for breast cancer. Mary had always been a competitive person and when she saw how much money other people were able to raise, she kicked it into high gear and single-handedly raised 38,000, one thousand dollars for each year her mother had been gone. But instead of patting herself on the back for a job well done, Mary credits the people in her small town with helping her raise the funds. And her fund-raising endeavors made her recognize that raising money for cancer research was near and dear to her neighbors’ hearts. She began to do some research and she discovered that her home state of Connecticut had the second highest rate of breast cancer in the nation. And that sparked an idea. Mary decided to start her own nonprofit agency to raise money, and she got the entire community involved. She named her organization Seymour Pink, after her town of Seymour, Connecticut. Each October—breast cancer awareness month—the town makes sure everyone has an opportunity to “see more pink.” Businesses decorate with pink. Pink banners honoring survivors and memorializing loved ones who have lost their battle to breast cancer are hung on the light posts throughout the town. Homes are decorated with pink ribbons and balloons. Over the years, Mary has raised almost a half million dollars for breast cancer–related causes. Her organization donates some money for cancer research and also provides direct financial support to families who are affected by cancer. Not only does Mary not take any of the credit—she only boasts about how wonderful her community members are who participate in her fund-raisers—but she also fails to mention her personal triumphs. I only learned about the obstacles she overcame because someone else told me. Just three years into her fund-raising efforts, Mary was in a severe car accident. A traumatic brain injury left her with significant speech and cognitive issues. But even a serious car accident couldn’t hold someone like Mary back. She went to speech therapy eight times a week and was determined to get back to raising money for breast cancer patients and research. At a time when most people would have retired, Mary said, “I’m not going out like that.” She knew it would be a long road to recovery but she didn’t believe in quitting. It took her five years, but by 2008, she returned to her job as a high school science teacher and resumed her fund-raising efforts. Mary didn’t set out to change the world. Instead, she focused on what she could do to make a difference. If you start by changing your life, you can begin to make a difference in the lives of other people. Mother Teresa said, “I alone cannot change the world, but I can cast a stone across the waters to create many ripples.” Mary Deming didn’t set out to change the entire world either, but she sure has changed a lot of lives. IDENTIFY THE PROS AND CONS OF CHANGING Create a list of what is good about staying the same and what is bad about staying the same. Then, create a list about the potentially good and bad outcomes of making a change. Don’t simply make your decision based on the sheer number of pros versus cons. Instead, examine the list. Read it over a few times and think about the potential consequences of changing versus staying the same. If you’re still considering change, this exercise can help you move closer to making a decision. There’s no need to change for the sake of change. Moving to a new home, starting a new relationship, or switching jobs aren’t inherently going to increase your mental strength. Instead, it’s important to pay close attention to the reasons why you want to change so you can determine whether the decision is about doing what’s ultimately best for you. If you’re still ambivalent, create a behavioral experiment. Unless you’re dealing with an all-or-nothing change, try something new for one week. After you’ve done it for a week, evaluate your progress and motivation. Decide if you want to continue with the change or not. DEVELOP AN AWARENESS OF YOUR EMOTIONS Pay attention to the emotions that are influencing your decision as well. When you think about making a change, how do you feel? For example: • Are you nervous that the change won’t last? • Do you feel exhausted at the sheer thought of doing something different? • Are you worried about your ability to follow through with the change? • Are you scared things may get worse? • Are you sad that you’ll have to give something up? • Are you uncomfortable even admitting a problem exists? Once you identify some of your emotions, you can decide whether it makes sense to act contrary to those emotions. Richard, for example, felt a variety of emotions. He was nervous about committing to something new. He was feeling guilty that he may need to give up time with his family to exercise and he was worried that he wouldn’t be successful at managing his health. Despite all that, he was even more fearful about what would happen to him if he didn’t make a change. Don’t allow your emotions to make the final decision. Sometimes you have to be willing to change, even when you don’t “feel like it.” Balance your emotions with rational thinking. If you’re terrified of doing something new, and it really won’t make a big difference in your life, you may decide it’s not worth putting yourself through the stress of change. But, if you can rationally identify how change will be best for you in the long term, it may make sense to tolerate the discomfort. MANAGE NEGATIVE THOUGHTS Look for unrealistically negative thoughts that may be influencing you. Once you’ve started to make changes, the way you think about the process can also greatly affect how motivated you’ll be to keep going. Be on the alert for these types of thoughts that will tempt you to shy away from change: • This will never work. • I can’t handle doing something different. • It will be too hard. • It’ll be too stressful to give up the things I like. • What I’m doing now isn’t that bad. • There’s no sense in trying because I tried something like that before and it didn’t help. • I don’t deal with change well. Just because you think it will be difficult doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do it. Often, some of the best things in life come from our ability to conquer a challenge through hard work. CREATE A SUCCESSFUL PLAN FOR CHANGE Preparing for the change can be the most important step. Create a plan for how you’ll implement the change and how you’ll stick to it. Once you have a plan in place, then you can implement the behavioral change one small step at a time. Initially, Richard told himself he needed to lose seventy-five pounds. Thinking about that huge number however, overwhelmed him. He just didn’t think it was possible. He started each day with the best of intentions, but by the evening, he slid back into his old habits. It wasn’t until he began focusing on what he could do today that he was able to start making helpful behavioral changes. By establishing smaller goals, such as losing five pounds, he was able to create action steps that he could do each day. He kept a food journal, packed his lunch instead of dining out, and went for a short walk with his family on the days he didn’t go to the gym. Unless you’re dealing with an all-or-nothing type of change, you can create change in incremental steps. Prepare for making the change with these steps: • Create a goal for what you would like to accomplish in the next thirty days. Sometimes people try to change everything all at once. Identify one goal that you want to focus on first and establish a realistic expectation for what you’d like to see change in one month’s time. • Establish concrete behavior changes you can make to reach that goal each day. Identify at least one step you can take each day to move closer to your goal. • Anticipate obstacles along the way. Make a plan for how you will respond to specific challenges that you’re likely to encounter. Planning ahead can help you stay on track. • Establish accountability. We do best when we establish some type of accountability for our progress. Enlist the help of friends and family who can provide support and check in with you about your progress. Be accountable to yourself by writing down your progress daily. • Monitor your progress. Determine how you’ll keep track of your progress. Keeping a record of your efforts and daily achievements can help you stay motivated to maintain changes. BEHAVE LIKE THE PERSON YOU WANT TO BECOME If your goal is to be more outgoing, behave in a friendly manner. If you want to be a successful salesperson, study how successful salespeople behave and then do what they do. You don’t necessarily have to wait until you feel like it or until the right time comes; start changing your behavior now. Richard wanted to be healthier, so he needed to behave like a healthy person. Eating a healthy diet and engaging in more physical activity were two things Richard could start doing to get closer to his goals. Clearly identify the type of person you’d like to be. Then, be proactive about becoming that person. So often I hear, “I wish I could have more friends.” Don’t wait for friends to come to you; start acting like a friendly person now and you can develop new friendships. EMBRACING CHANGE WILL MAKE YOU STRONGER Judge Greg Mathis was raised in the projects of Detroit during the 1960s and 1970s. As a teenager, he was arrested many times, and he dropped out of school to join a gang. At the age of seventeen, while incarcerated at a juvenile detention center, his mother was diagnosed with colon cancer. Mathis was offered early probation as a result of her illness and promised his dying mother he’d turn his life around once and for all. His probation terms required him to maintain a job, and he began working at McDonald’s. He was accepted to Eastern Michigan University and went on to law school. Due to his criminal history, he wasn’t able to get a job as a lawyer, but that didn’t stop him from finding ways to help the city of Detroit. He became manager of the Detroit Neighborhood City Halls. Around the same time, he and his wife established Young Adults Asserting Themselves, a nonprofit agency that helped young people find employment. A few years later, Mathis decided to run for judge. Although his opponents reminded the community of his criminal background, the people of Detroit believed Mathis was a changed man. Mathis was elected the youngest judge in Michigan’s history after beating out the twenty-year incumbent. Judge Mathis soon gained Hollywood attention and in 1999, he began a successful TV show where he settles small-claims disputes. Once a criminal himself, Judge Mathis now donates much of his time and energy to helping young people make better decisions in their lives. He tours the country offering Youth and Education Expos that encourage young people to make the best choices they can for their future. He’s received multiple awards and commendations for his ability to inspire young people to avoid making the same mistakes he made in his life. Sometimes change results in a complete transformation that could alter the entire course of your life. So often, when people become committed to create change in one area of their lives, like pay off their debt, before they know it, they’re also losing weight and their marriages improve. Positive change leads to increased motivation and increased motivation leads to more positive change. Embracing change is a two-way street. TROUBLESHOOTING AND COMMON TRAPS Unfortunately, your life will change whether you want it to or not. Change created by job loss, death of a loved one, a friend moving away, or kids moving out are all a part of life. When you practice adapting to the small changes, you’ll be better prepared to deal with the large inevitable changes that come your way. Pay attention to the way you handle change. Watch out for warning signs that you may be avoiding important change that could ultimately improve your life.

James had struggled with his ex-wife, Carmen, for custody of their seven-year-old daughter for over three years. The judge had given primary custody to Carmen, allowing James visitation on Wednesday evenings and weekends. James was outraged by the judge’s decision, as he was certain he was the better parent. James was convinced that Carmen was out to get him and destroy his relationship with his daughter. He’d recently informed Carmen that he was planning a whale-watching excursion for his daughter. When the trip neared, however, his daughter informed him that her mother had taken her whale watching the week prior. James was infuriated. He felt like Carmen was always trying to upstage him or win their daughter’s favor by throwing her the biggest birthday parties, buying her the most expensive Christmas gifts, and taking her on the most lavish vacations. James couldn’t afford to keep up with his ex-wife financially nor did he want to compete with her lack of discipline. Carmen allowed their daughter to stay up late, play outside alone, and eat as much junk food as she wanted. He tried to talk to Carmen about his concerns many times, but she made it clear she wasn’t interested in his opinion. James was pretty sure Carmen just wanted him to look like the bad guy in the eyes of their daughter. He also didn’t like the fact that his ex-wife was dating again because he worried about the type of men their daughter would be exposed to. He even told Carmen that he saw her boyfriend with another woman once, in the hopes that they would break up. His plan backfired when she threatened to get a restraining order against him if he didn’t leave her alone. James initially came to therapy not because he wanted help dealing with his emotions, but because he was looking for a legal ally. He wanted me to write a letter to the court outlining the reasons why he should have full custody of his daughter. When I explained that I couldn’t do that, he initially said he didn’t think therapy could possibly be helpful. But, instead of leaving, he just kept talking. When I asked him how effective his previous attempts to change the judge’s mind had been, he acknowledged that the judge was pretty clear that the custody order was going to remain in place, whether he liked it or not. He also admitted he hadn’t been able to convince Carmen to make any changes, despite his intense efforts. By the end of the session, James actually agreed to come to another appointment. During his next appointment, we discussed how his attempts to control the situation were negatively affecting his daughter. He recognized how his anger toward his ex-wife interfered with his relationship with his little girl. We discussed some strategies that could help him refocus some of his efforts on improving his relationship with his daughter instead. By the time James returned for his third and final session I knew he got it when he said, “I should have focused on having fun with my daughter when we went whale watching, rather than spending the entire trip texting angry messages to her mother about how I didn’t appreciate her attempts to overshadow me.” He also recognized that although he didn’t agree with some of Carmen’s rules, dragging her back to court repeatedly wasn’t likely to help resolve the situation. Instead, he’d only be wasting more money that he could be spending on their daughter. He decided that he should focus his energy on being the best role model he could be for their daughter, so he could be a positive influence in her life. KEEPING EVERYTHING UNDER CONTROL It feels so safe to have everything under control, but thinking we have the power to always pull the strings can become problematic. Do you respond positively to any of these points below? You spend a lot of time and energy trying to prevent anything bad from happening. You invest energy into wishing other people would change. When faced with a tough situation, you think you can single-handedly fix everything. You believe the outcome of any situation is entirely based on how much effort you choose to exert. You assume that good luck has nothing to do with success. Instead, it’s completely up to you to determine your future. Other people sometimes accuse you of being a “control freak.” You struggle to delegate tasks to other people because you don’t think they’ll do the job right. Even when you recognize you aren’t able to completely control a situation, you struggle to let it go. If you fail at something, you believe you are solely responsible. You don’t feel comfortable asking for help. You think people who don’t reach their goals are completely responsible for their situation. You struggle with teamwork because you doubt the abilities of other people on the team. You have difficulty establishing meaningful relationships because you don’t trust people. Are you guilty of any of the examples above? We can’t possibly make all our circumstances and all the people in our lives fit into the way we think things should be. When you learn to let go of the details you can’t control, the amount of time and energy you’ll be able to devote to the things you can control will give you the ability to accomplish incredible feats. WHY WE TRY TO CONTROL EVERYTHING James felt very guilty about the divorce. He had tried to make his marriage work with Carmen, because he wanted their daughter to grow up in a stable home. When their relationship ended, he didn’t want their daughter to suffer. Clearly, James was a loving father who worried about his daughter’s well-being. It was terrifying for him to recognize how little control he had over what happened to his daughter when she was with her mother. To reduce his anxiety, he tried to control as much of the situation as he could. He thought that if he were able to control everything—from who his ex-wife dated to the type of rules she had in her home—he would feel better. Trying to control everything usually starts out as a way to manage anxiety. If you know you have everything under control, what’s there to worry about? Rather than focusing on managing your anxiety, you try controlling your environment. The desire to fix everything can also stem from a sort of superhero complex. We hold on to the mistaken belief that if we just try hard enough, everything will turn out the way we want. Rather than delegating a task to a coworker, or trusting a spouse to run an errand, we often choose to do it ourselves to make sure it will be “done right” because we don’t trust in other people’s capabilities. LOCUS OF CONTROL Deciding what is within your control and what isn’t depends largely upon your belief system. The psychology field refers to this as your locus of control. People with an external locus of control believe that their lives depend highly on fate, luck, or destiny. They’re more likely to believe “Whatever’s meant to be will be.” People with an internal locus of control believe they have complete control over their future. They take full responsibility for their successes and failures in life. They believe they have the ability to control everything from their financial future to their health. Your locus of control will determine how you view your circumstances. Imagine a person who attends a job interview. He possesses the qualifications, education, and experience the company is looking for. But a few days after the interview, he receives a call telling him he didn’t get the job. If he has an external locus of control he’ll think, They probably had some overqualified people apply for the position. It wasn’t the right job for me anyway. If he has an internal locus of control, he’s more likely to think, I must not have done a good job impressing them. I knew I should have redone my résumé. I’ve also got to sharpen my interview skills. Several factors influence your locus of control. Your childhood experiences certainly play a role. If you grew up in a family where hard work was valued, you may lean more toward an internal locus of control, because you’ll believe that hard work can pay off. If however, you grew up with parents who drilled into you things such as, “Your vote doesn’t matter in this world,” or “No matter what you do, the world will always keep you down,” you may have developed an external locus of control. Your experiences throughout life can also influence your locus of control. If you achieve success when you try hard, you’ll see that you have a lot of control over the outcome. But if you feel like no matter what you do, things just don’t turn out right, you may begin to feel like you have less control. An internal locus of control has often been idealized as the “best” way to be. Ideas like “You can do anything if you just put your mind to it” have been valued in many cultures. In fact, people with a high sense of control often make great CEOs because they believe in their ability to make a difference. Doctors like having patients with a strong internal locus of control because they do everything possible to treat and prevent illness. But there are also potential downsides to believing you can control everything. THE PROBLEM WITH WASTING ENERGY ON THINGS YOU CAN’T CONTROL James wasted a lot of time, energy, and money on trying to change his custody situation even though his repeated court appearances clearly weren’t influencing the judge’s decision. Although he initially thought that exerting more effort into controlling the situation would reduce his stress, over the long term, his stress increased each time he failed at his attempts to gain more control. His attempts to gain control also negatively impacted his relationship with his daughter. Instead of enjoying their time together and focusing on nurturing their relationship, he grilled her with questions to learn more about what was going on at her mother’s house. There are several problems associated with trying to control everything: • Trying to maintain complete control leads to increased anxiety. Efforts to manage your anxiety by trying to control everything in your environment will backfire. The more unsuccessful your attempts to control the situation are, the more anxious you’ll become. It can lead to feelings of inadequacy as you see that you aren’t able to fully control the outcome. • Attempting to control everything wastes time and energy. Worrying about things outside of your control wastes mental energy. Wishing circumstances were different, trying to convince people they have to do everything your way, and attempting to prevent anything bad from ever happening is exhausting. It takes energy away from actively problem solving and the issues you do have control over. • Being a control freak damages relationships. Telling people what they should do or how to do things right isn’t likely to attract many friends. In fact, many who have control issues struggle to get close to people because they don’t trust others with any type of responsibility. • You’ll judge others harshly. If you credit all your success in life to your abilities, you’ll criticize people who haven’t achieved the same. In fact, people with a high internal locus of control tend to suffer from loneliness because they feel irritable that other people aren’t keeping up with their standards. • You’ll unnecessarily blame yourself for everything. You can’t prevent bad things from happening all the time. But, if you think everything is within your control, you’ll believe you’re directly responsible every time life doesn’t go according to your plan. DEVELOP A BALANCED SENSE OF CONTROL James couldn’t move forward until he accepted that he didn’t have complete control over the custody situation. Once he was able to recognize this, he could focus on the things he did have control over—like improving his relationship with his daughter. He also wanted to focus on establishing at least a civil relationship with his ex-wife, but to do that, he needed to continue reminding himself that he couldn’t control what went on in her home. Clearly, if he recognized any signs that his daughter was being seriously harmed, he could act, but eating ice cream and staying up late didn’t rise to the level of danger that would make a judge give him custody. Those who strike the right balance of control recognize how their behaviors can affect their chances of success, but they also identify how external factors, such as being in the right place at the right time, can play a role. Researchers found that these people have a bi-locus of control, as opposed to a complete internal or external locus of control. To achieve this balance in your own life, be willing to examine your beliefs about what you truly can control and what you can’t. Take notice of times when you’ve devoted too much energy to people and circumstances that you just couldn’t change. Remind yourself that there’s a lot you can’t control: • You can host a good party, but you can’t control whether people have fun. • You can give your child tools to be successful, but you can’t make your child be a good student. • You can do your best at your job, but you can’t force your boss to recognize your work. • You can sell a great product, but you can’t dictate who buys it. • You may be the smartest person in the room, but you can’t control whether people choose to follow your advice. • You can nag, beg, and make threats, but you can’t force your spouse to behave differently. • You can have the most positive attitude in the world, but it can’t make a terminal diagnosis disappear. • You can control how much you take care of yourself, but you can’t always prevent illness. • You can control what you’re doing, but you can’t control your competitor. IDENTIFY YOUR FEARS In 2005, Heather Von St. James was diagnosed with mesothelioma when her daughter was just three months old. As a little girl, she had worn her father’s construction jacket for fun. His jacket had most likely been exposed to asbestos, which has been linked to mesothelioma and could explain why at only thirty-six, Heather had what is known as an “old man’s disease.” Doctors initially gave Heather fifteen months to live. With radiation and chemotherapy, they said she might live up to five years. She was, however, a prime candidate for lung removal, and although the surgery was risky, it was her best chance for survival. Heather chose to undergo the extensive surgery that would remove the affected lung and the lining around her lung as well as replace half of her diaphragm and the lining of her heart with surgical Gore-Tex. She remained hospitalized for a month following the operation. When she was discharged from the hospital, she went to stay with her parents for a few months so they could help her care for her baby while her husband returned to work. When Heather returned home three months later, she underwent radiation and chemotherapy. It took her almost a year to begin feeling better again, but to this day, she remains cancer free. Although she becomes out of breath more easily with physical exertion now that she only has one lung, she considers it a relatively small price to pay. To commemorate the anniversary of the day she got her lung removed, Heather now celebrates, “Lung Leavin’ Day” on February 2 each year. Each year on “Lung Leavin’ Day,” Heather acknowledges her fears about the things she doesn’t have control over—like the possibility of the cancer returning. She uses a marker to write those fears on a plate and then she symbolically lets go of those fears by smashing the plate into a fire. Within just a few short years, the celebration has grown. Today, more than eighty friends and family attend. Guests join in by writing down their own fears and smashing their plates into the fire. They’ve even turned it into a fund-raiser for mesothelioma research. “Cancer leaves you feeling so out of control,” Heather acknowledges. Although she is currently cancer free, she admits that she continues to be fearful that her daughter may have to grow up without a mother. But she chooses to face her fears head-on by writing down what scares her most, and recognizing that those things are not within her control. She then chooses to focus her efforts on what she does have control over—like living every day to the fullest. Heather now works as a patient advocate for mesothelioma. She speaks with newly diagnosed patients and helps them deal with their fears about cancer. She’s also a keynote speaker who delivers her message of hope and healing. When you notice yourself trying to control something that you can’t, ask yourself, What am I so afraid of? Do you worry someone else is going to make a bad choice? Do you worry that something is going to go terribly wrong? Are you terrified that you won’t be successful? Acknowledging your fears, and developing an understanding of them, will help you begin to recognize what is within your control and what isn’t. FOCUS ON WHAT YOU CAN CONTROL Once you’ve identified your fears, identify what you can control, bearing in mind that sometimes the only thing you can control is your behavior and attitude. You can’t control what happens to your luggage once you hand it to an airline employee at the airport. But what you can control is what you pack in your carry-on bag. If you have your most important belongings and an extra change of clothing with you, it won’t feel like such an emergency if your luggage doesn’t arrive at your destination on time. By focusing on what you can control, it is much easier to let go of worrying about what you can’t. When you notice you have a lot of anxiety about a situation, do what you can to manage your reaction and influence the outcome. But recognize that you can’t control other people, and you can’t ever have complete control over the end result. INFLUENCE PEOPLE WITHOUT TRYING TO CONTROL THEM Jenny was twenty years old when she chose to drop out of college. After spending a couple of years working toward a degree in education, she decided she didn’t really want to be a math teacher. To her mother’s horror, she wanted to pursue art instead. Every day Jenny’s mother called to tell Jenny she was ruining her life. She made it clear she would never support Jenny’s choice to drop out of school. She even threatened to cut off contact with Jenny if she didn’t choose to take “the right path.” Jenny quickly got sick of her mother’s daily criticisms over her choices. She told her mother several times that she was not going back to college and her insults and threats wouldn’t change her mind. But her mother persisted because she worried about what type of future Jenny would have as an artist. Eventually, Jenny stopped answering the phone. She stopped going to her mother’s house for dinner, too. After all, it wasn’t enjoyable to hear her mother lecture her about how college dropouts and aspiring artists don’t ever make it in the real world. Even though Jenny was a grown adult, her mother wanted to control what she did. It was painful for her to sit on the sidelines and watch Jenny make choices she felt were irresponsible. She imagined her daughter would always be broke, unhappy, and struggling just to survive. Jenny’s mother mistakenly believed she could control what Jenny did with her life. Unfortunately, her attempts to control Jenny ruined their relationship without motivating Jenny to do anything different. It’s hard to sit back and watch other people engage in behavior we don’t approve of, especially if that behavior is something we view as self-destructive. But making demands, nagging, and begging won’t yield the results you want. Here are strategies to influence others without trying to force them to change: • Listen first, speak second. Other people are often less defensive when they feel like you’ve taken the time to hear what they have to say. • Share your opinion and concerns, but only share it once. Repeating your unease over and over again won’t make your words any more effective. In fact, it can backfire. • Change your behavior. If a wife doesn’t want her husband to drink, emptying his beer cans down the drain isn’t going to motivate him to stop drinking. But she can choose to spend time with him when he’s sober and not be around him when he’s drinking. If he enjoys spending time with her, he may choose to remain sober more often. • Point out the positive. If someone is making a genuine effort to create change, whether it’s to stop smoking or start exercising, offer some genuine praise. Just don’t go overboard or say something like, “See, I told you that you’d feel better if you quit eating all that junk food.” Backhanded compliments or an “I told you so” don’t motivate people to change. PRACTICE ACCEPTANCE Imagine a man stuck in a traffic jam. Traffic hasn’t moved an inch for twenty minutes and he’s running late for a meeting. He starts yelling, swearing, and banging his fists on the steering wheel. He wants so much to be in control that he just can’t tolerate the fact that he’s going to be late. These people should just get out of my way, he thinks. It’s ridiculous that there’s this much traffic in the middle of the afternoon. Contrast that person with someone in the car next to him who turns on the radio and chooses to sing along to some of his favorite tunes while he waits. He figures, I’ll get there when I can. He uses his time and energy wisely because he knows he has no control over when traffic will start moving again. Instead, he tells himself, There are millions of cars on the road every day. Sometimes traffic jams are bound to happen. Either of these people could choose to do something different in the future to avoid traffic. They could leave earlier, take a different route, use public transportation, check the traffic report ahead of time, or even start a movement to try and change the road systems. But, for now, they have the choice to accept that they’re stuck in a traffic jam or focus on the fact that they feel an injustice is being done. Even though you might not like the situation you’re in, you can choose to accept it. You can accept that your boss is mean, that your mother doesn’t approve of you, or that your kids aren’t striving to be high achievers. That doesn’t mean you can’t work toward influencing them by changing your behavior, but it does mean you can stop trying to force them to be different. GIVING UP CONTROL WILL MAKE YOU STRONGER At the age of eighteen, Terry Fox was diagnosed with osteosarcoma. Doctors amputated his leg but warned him that his survival rate was only 50 percent. They also made it clear that major advances had been made in cancer treatment over the past few years. Just two years previously, the survival rate for this type of cancer was only 15 percent. Within three weeks of his surgery, Fox was walking with the help of a prosthetic limb. His doctors noted that his positive attitude most likely had something to do with his rapid recovery. He underwent sixteen months of chemotherapy and during that time, he met many other patients who were dying from cancer. By the time his treatment ended, he decided to spread the word about the need for more funding for cancer research. On the night before he got his leg amputated, he’d read a story about a man who had run the New York City marathon with a prosthetic leg. The article inspired him to begin running as soon as he was physically able. He ran his first marathon in British Columbia, and though he finished in last place, he was met with a lot of support at the finish line. After completing the marathon, Fox hatched a fund-raising plan. He decided to run across Canada by completing a marathon every single day. Initially, he hoped to earn a million dollars for charity, but he soon set his sights even higher. He wanted to raise one dollar for each person in Canada—a grand total of 24 million. In April of 1980, he set out to run over twenty-six miles a day. As word of his trek began to spread, his support increased. Communities began holding large receptions to commemorate his arrival in their town. He was asked to give speeches, and the amount of money he raised increased. Fox ran for an amazing 143 days straight. But his run came to an end one day when he couldn’t catch his breath and he began experiencing chest pain. He was taken to the hospital and doctors confirmed that his cancer had returned and spread to his lungs. After running over three thousand miles, he was forced to stop. His journey had raised over 1.7 million by the time he was hospitalized. But as the news of his hospitalization circulated, he gained even more support. A five-hour telethon raised 10.5 million. Donations continued and by the next spring, Fox had raised over 23 million. Although he attempted a variety of treatments, his cancer continued to spread, and in June of 1981, Fox died from complications of his cancer. Fox understood he couldn’t control every aspect of his health. He couldn’t stop people from getting cancer. He couldn’t even control the spread of the disease in his own body. Instead of focusing on those things, he chose to put his energy into the things he could control. In his letter requesting support prior to his run, Fox made it clear he didn’t think his run would cure cancer, but he knew it would make a difference. “The running thing I can do, even if I have to crawl every last mile,” he said. His choice to do something that seemed unimaginable gave him a purpose that continues today. Each year, countries all over the world participate in the Terry Fox run. Over 650 million has been raised in his honor. When you stop trying to control every aspect of your life, you’ll have more time and energy to devote to things you can control. Here are some of the benefits you’ll experience: • Increased happiness—The maximum level of happiness is achieved when people have a balanced locus of control. Coined as a “bi-local expectancy,” the people who understand that they can take a lot of steps to control their lives while also recognizing the limitations of their ability are happier than people who think they can control everything. • Better relationships—When you give up your need for control, you’ll likely experience better relationships. You’ll have fewer trust issues and you’ll welcome more people into your life. You may be more willing to ask for help, and other people are likely to view you as less critical. Research indicates that people who stop trying to control everything experience an increased sense of belonging and community. • Less stress—When you stop carrying around the weight of the world, you’ll feel less stressed. You may experience more short-term anxiety as you give up control, but over the long term, you’ll have a lot less stress and anxiety. • New opportunities—When you have a strong need to control things, you’ll be less likely to invite change into your life because there aren’t any guarantees of a positive outcome. When you choose to give up your need to control everything, you’ll have increased confidence in your ability to handle new opportunities. • More success—Although most people who want to control everything have a deep desire to be successful, having an internal locus of control can actually interfere with your chances of success. Research shows that it’s possible to become so focused on ensuring you’ll be successful, you could actually overlook opportunities that could help you advance. When you give up your desire to control everything, you’ll be more willing to look around and you may recognize good fortune that comes your way even if it isn’t directly related to your behavior. TROUBLESHOOTING AND COMMON TRAPS When you focus on what’s wrong with the world, without looking at how you can control your attitude and behavior, you’ll find yourself stuck. Instead of wasting energy trying to prevent a storm, focus on how you can prepare for it. WHAT’S HELPFUL Delegating tasks and responsibilities to other people Asking for help when you need it Focusing on solving problems that are within your control Keeping the emphasis on influencing others rather than controlling them Thinking balanced thoughts about what is within your control and what isn’t Not relying on yourself for the entire outcome WHAT’S NOT HELPFUL Insisting on doing everything because no one else can do it right Choosing to do everything on your own because you think you should be able to accomplish things without help Spending time trying to figure out how to change things that are likely beyond your direct control Trying to force other people to do what you think they should do, regardless of how they feel Only thinking about what you can do to make things turn out the way you want Taking full responsibility for the end result without acknowledging other factors that influence the outcome OceanofPDF.com CHAPTER 5 THEY DON’T WORRY ABOUT PLEASING EVERYONE Care about what other people think and you will always be their prisoner. —LAO TZU Megan entered my therapy office looking for help because she was feeling stressed out and overwhelmed. She said there weren’t enough hours in the day to accomplish everything she needed to do. At age thirty-five, she was married and had two young children. She worked a part-time job, taught Sunday school, and was the Girl Scout troop leader. She strived to be a good wife and mother, but she felt like she just wasn’t doing a good enough job. She was often irritable and grumpy toward her family and she wasn’t sure why. The more Megan talked, the clearer it became that she was a woman who couldn’t say no. Church members frequently called her on Saturday nights, asking her to bake muffins for Sunday morning’s church service. Parents of her Girl Scout troop sometimes relied on her to drive their children home if they were stuck at work. Megan also frequently babysat for her sister’s kids, so her sister wouldn’t have to spend money on a sitter. She also had a cousin who sought favors and always seemed to have some sort of last-minute problem, ranging from being short on cash to needing help with a home improvement project. Lately, Megan had stopped answering her cousin’s phone calls because she knew that every time she called she needed something. Megan said to me that her number one rule was to never say no to family. So each time her cousin asked for a favor or her sister asked her to babysit, she automatically said yes. When I asked her what impact that had on her husband and children, she told me that sometimes it meant she wasn’t home in time for dinner or to put the kids to bed. Just admitting that out loud helped Megan begin to realize why saying yes to extended family meant she was saying no to her immediate family. Although she valued her extended family, her husband and her children were her top priorities, and she decided she needed to start treating them accordingly. We also reviewed her desire to be liked by everyone. Her biggest fear was that other people would think she was selfish. However, after a few therapy sessions she began to recognize that her need to always be liked was actually much more selfish than saying no to someone. Helping others really wasn’t about improving their lives; she was mostly giving of herself because she wanted to be held in higher regard. Once she changed the way she thought about people pleasing, she was able to begin changing her behavior. It took some practice for Megan to begin saying no to people. In fact, she wasn’t even sure how to say no. She thought she needed an excuse but she didn’t want to lie. But I encouraged her to simply say something like “No, I’m not able to do that,” without providing a lengthy reason why. She began practicing saying no and she found that the more she did it, the easier it became. Although she had imagined people would become angry with her, she quickly noticed that they didn’t really seem to mind. The more time she spent with her family, the less irritable she felt. Her stress level also decreased and after saying no a few times, she felt less pressured to please others. PEOPLE-PLEASING SIGNS While in chapter 2 we discussed how giving away your power is about allowing people to control how you feel; people pleasing is about trying to control how other people feel. Do you respond positively to any of the points below? You feel responsible for how other people feel. The thought of anyone being mad at you causes you to feel uncomfortable. You tend to be a “pushover.” You find it easier to agree with people rather than express a contrary opinion. You often apologize even when you don’t think you did anything wrong. You go to great lengths to avoid conflict. You don’t usually tell people when you’re feeling offended or your feelings are hurt. You tend to say yes when people ask you for favors, even if you really don’t want to do something. You change your behavior based on what you think other people want. You put a lot of energy into trying to impress people. If you hosted a party and people didn’t seem to be enjoying themselves, you’d feel responsible. You seek praise and approval from people in your life often. When someone around you is upset, you take responsibility for trying to make him or her feel better. You would never want anyone to think you are selfish. You often feel overscheduled and overburdened by all the things you have to do. Do any of those examples sound familiar? Attempts to be a “nice person” can backfire when your behavior crosses over into people pleasing. It can take a serious toll on all areas of your life and make it impossible to reach your goals. You can still be a kind and generous person without trying to please everyone. WHY WE TRY TO PLEASE PEOPLE Megan strived to develop a reputation as someone who could always meet other people’s needs. Her self-worth was fueled by the way other people seemed to perceive her. She went to such great lengths to make others happy because in her mind the alternatives—finding herself in the midst of conflict, feeling rejected, or losing relationships—were much worse than the emotional and physical exhaustion she felt. FEAR Conflict and confrontation can be uncomfortable. It’s usually not enjoyable to sit between squabbling coworkers in a meeting. And who wants to attend a family holiday gathering when their relatives are arguing? Fearing conflict, we tell ourselves, If I can make everyone happy, everything will be okay. When a people pleaser sees a car approaching quickly, he may drive faster because he thinks, That guy is in a hurry. I don’t want to make him mad by going too slow. People pleasers may also fear rejection or abandonment. If I don’t make you happy, you won’t like me. They thrive on praise and reassurance from others, and if they’re not receiving enough positive reinforcement, they change their behavior to try and make people feel happy. LEARNED BEHAVIOR Sometimes the desire to avoid conflict stems from childhood. If you were raised by parents who were constantly bickering, you may have learned that conflict is bad and keeping people happy is the best way to prevent arguments. Children of alcoholics, for example, often grow up to be people pleasers because that was the best way to deal with a parent’s unpredictable behavior. In other cases, doing good deeds was the only way to get any attention. Putting other people first can also become a way to feel needed and important. I’m worth something if I can make other people feel happy. So it becomes a habit to always invest energy into other people’s feelings and lives. A lot of my clients will often tell me they need to behave like a doormat, because that’s what the Bible says they should do. But I’m pretty sure the Bible says to “treat your neighbor as yourself,” not better than yourself. Most spiritual guidance encourages us to be bold enough to live according to our values, even when doing so displeases some people. THE PROBLEM WITH PEOPLE PLEASING Megan’s desire to please others made her lose sight of her values. She wasn’t getting her needs met and it impacted her mood. She realized exactly how much her increased attempts to please others had affected her family when—after a few therapy sessions—her husband said to her, “I feel like I’ve got my old Megan back.” YOUR ASSUMPTIONS AREN’T ALWAYS TRUE Sally invites Jane to go shopping with her. The only reason Sally invites Jane is because Jane asked her out for coffee last week and Sally thinks it would be nice to reciprocate. However, Sally actually hopes Jane declines because she wants to make it a quick trip to the mall to pick out some shoes. She knows if Jane goes, she’ll likely want to shop for hours. Jane actually doesn’t want to go shopping. She has some errands to run and a few household chores to finish up. But she doesn’t want to hurt Sally’s feelings. So when Sally invites her to the mall, she agrees to go. Both of these women think they’re doing something that pleases the other person. However, they clearly have no idea what the other person wants. Their “attempts to be nice” are actually causing more of a nuisance to each other. But neither one has the courage to actually speak up and say what she really wants. Most of us wrongly assume that people-pleasing behavior proves we’re generous. But when you think about it, always trying to please people isn’t a selfless act. It’s actually quite self-centered. It assumes that everyone cares about your every move. It also assumes you think you have the power to control how other people feel. If you’re constantly doing things to make others happy and you don’t think they are appreciative of your efforts, you’ll soon experience resentment. Thoughts such as I do so much for you, but you don’t do anything for me will creep in and ultimately hurt your relationships. PEOPLE PLEASING DAMAGES RELATIONSHIPS Angela didn’t try to please everyone in her life, just the men she dated. If she was on a date with a man who said he liked women with a sense of humor, she’d make a few extra jokes. If she was on a date with a man who said he liked spontaneous women, she’d tell him all about the last-minute trip to France she took last summer. If, however, another man said he liked smart women, she’d talk about that same trip to France but this time she’d say she went because she wanted to view fine art. Angela did whatever she could to try to make herself appear more attractive to whomever she was dating. She felt that if she said enough things that were pleasing to her date, she’d get to go on a second date. She didn’t think about the long-term consequences of her ever-changing personality. Eventually, she wasn’t able to please anyone quite enough to stay with her for the long haul. No respectable man wanted to date a shell of a woman who behaved like a puppet. In fact, a lot of her dates got annoyed fairly quickly by Angela because she constantly agreed with everything they said. Her attempts to say whatever they wanted to hear were usually pretty transparent. Angela feared that if she disagreed with a date or held an opposing opinion, he would no longer be interested in her, which reveals her lack of trust. You won’t keep me around unless I do what you want, she thought. If you truly care about someone and you believe the person cares about you, you’d have to be willing to tell that individual the truth. You recognize that even if that person doesn’t like something you say or do, he or she can still enjoy your company. It’s an impossible feat to always make everyone around you happy. Perhaps your father-in-law asks you to help him on a project. But if you leave to go help him, your spouse will get angry because you had already made plans to have lunch together. When faced with such a decision, people pleasers will often choose to risk not pleasing the person closest to them. They know that their spouse will eventually get over being offended. Unfortunately, this leaves the people you love the most feeling hurt or angry. Shouldn’t we do the opposite? Shouldn’t we work the hardest on the most intimate and special relationships? Ever met someone who behaves like a martyr? Such individuals’ attempts to please others actually becomes a turnoff. They’re constantly saying things like “I do everything around here” or “If I don’t do it, no one will.” Martyrs risk becoming angry, bitter people, as their attempts to make others happy backfire. Whether you’re guilty of thinking you’re a martyr, or you simply struggle to say no when you fear you’ll hurt someone’s feelings, there aren’t any guarantees people will like you just because you try to please them. Instead, they may simply start taking advantage of you without forming a deeper relationship based on trust and mutual respect. PEOPLE PLEASERS LOSE SIGHT OF THEIR VALUES Bronnie Ware, an Australian nurse who spent many years working with patients who were dying, cites people pleasing as one of the biggest regrets she heard her patients share on their deathbeds. In her book, The Top Five Regrets of the Dying, she explains how dying people often said they wished they had lived a more authentic life. Instead of dressing, acting, and speaking in a manner that was pleasing to others, they’d wished they’d been true to themselves. There’s even research published in the Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology that shows people pleasers in a study tended to eat more when they thought it would make others around them happier. They were willing to sabotage their own health if they thought it would help the other people in the room even though they had no evidence that the people around them were even paying attention to what they were eating. Pleasing people will hold you back from reaching your full potential. Although people pleasers want to be liked, they often don’t want to be the best at anything because they fear being held in too high regard could make other people feel bad. Someone may not get that promotion at work because he doesn’t feel comfortable taking credit for the work he’s done. Or a woman who gets approached by an attractive man may choose not to reciprocate friendly conversation because she doesn’t want to make her friend feel bad that he didn’t start talking to her first. No matter what your values are, you’ll stop behaving according to them if you’re focused primarily on pleasing other people. You’ll quickly lose sight of doing what’s right and try only to do what makes other people happy. Just because it’s a popular choice doesn’t mean it’s the right choice. AVOID PEOPLE PLEASING Saying yes had become such a habit for Megan that she found herself agreeing to do things automatically. So I helped her to develop a mantra where she repeated to herself, “Saying yes to others means saying no to my husband and kids.” She knew it was okay to say yes to some things without her husband and children being negatively affected. She just couldn’t say yes all the time or her mood and family would suffer. DETERMINE WHO YOU WANT TO PLEASE If you want to be successful at reaching your goals, you need to define your path, not just do what other people want you to do. Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster knows the importance of this firsthand. Buckmaster became the CEO of Craigslist in 2000. While other websites were capitalizing on advertising, Craigslist wasn’t. In fact, Craigslist turned down a variety of revenue-generating opportunities. Instead, Buckmaster and the team decided to keep the website simple, and only charge users for a very few specific types of listings. The bulk of user-generated listings has remained a free service. In fact, the company doesn’t even have a marketing team. Craigslist received a lot of backlash for this decision and Buckmaster has been the target of much criticism. He’s been accused of being anticapitalistic and even called a “social anarchist.” But Buckmaster didn’t try to please his critics. Instead, he continued running Craigslist the way it has always operated. His willingness to go against the grain and prevent Craigslist from depending too heavily on advertisements has likely kept the business running. It survived the dot-com crash with ease and continues to be one of the most popular websites in the world. Craigslist has been estimated to be worth at least 5 billion. By not worrying about trying to please everyone, Buckmaster was able to keep the company focused on serving its purpose and reaching its audience. Before you automatically change your behavior based on what you think other people want, evaluate your thoughts and feelings. When you second-guess whether you should express your opinion, remember these truths about people pleasing: • Worrying about trying to please everyone is a waste of time. You can’t control how other people feel and the more time you spend devoting your thoughts to wondering if people will be happy, the less time you’ll have to think about what really matters. • People pleasers are easily manipulated. Others can recognize a people pleaser a mile away. Manipulators often use tactics to prey on people pleasers’ emotions and control their behavior. Be on the lookout for people who say things like “I’m only asking you to do to this because you’d do the best job” or “I hate to ask you this, but . . .” • It’s okay for other people to feel angry or disappointed. There is no reason that people need to feel happy or pleased all the time. Everyone has the ability to cope with a wide array of feelings, and it’s not your job to prevent them from feeling negative emotions. Just because someone gets mad, it doesn’t necessarily mean you did anything wrong. • You can’t please everyone. It’s impossible for everyone to be delighted by the same things. Accept that some people will just never be pleased, and it isn’t your job to make them happy. CLARIFY YOUR VALUES Imagine a single mother who works a full-time job at a factory. One day, when she wakes her son up for school, he says he doesn’t feel well. She checks his temperature and he has a slight fever. Clearly, he can’t go to school. She has to decide what to do with him for the day. She doesn’t have any friends or family members who can stay with him. She could call in sick to her job, but she won’t get paid if she takes the day off. If she doesn’t get paid for the day, she’ll struggle to afford groceries for the week. She also worries that missing another day of work could put her job at risk. She’s already missed a lot of days due to the children being sick. She decides to leave her son home alone for the day. She knows other people will likely have a negative opinion about her choice to leave a sick child home alone when he’s only ten years old. However, her values tell her it’s the right choice given her circumstances, regardless of how others may judge her. It’s not that she values her job more than her son. In fact, she values her family more than anything. But she knows that going to work is best for the greater good of her family in the long run. When you’re faced with decisions in your life, it’s important to know exactly what your values are so you can make the best choices. Could you easily list your top five values off the top of your head? Most people can’t. But if you aren’t really clear on your values, how do you know where to put your energy, and how to make the best decisions? Taking time to clarify your values can be a very worthwhile exercise. Common values include: • Children • Romantic relationship • Extended family • Religious/Spiritual beliefs • Volunteering or helping other people • Career • Money • Maintaining good friendships • Taking care of your physical health • Having a sense of purpose • Leisure activities • Pleasing people • Education Pick your top five values in life and rank them in order from most important to least important. Now stop and think about whether you are actually living according to those values. How much of your time, money, energy, and skill is devoted to each one? Are you putting too much effort into something that’s not even on your list? Where on your list does pleasing people fall? It should never be at the top. Reviewing the order of your list from time to time can help you determine if your life is out of balance. TAKE TIME TO DECIDE WHETHER TO SAY YES OR NO In the case of Megan, she avoided her cousin because she knew she couldn’t say no if she was asked to do a favor. To help her say no, we developed a script. Whenever anyone asked her to do something, she responded by saying, “Let me see what I have going on and I’ll get back to you.” That bought her some time to really think about whether she wanted to do something. Then, she could ensure that if she said yes it was because she wanted to, not simply because she wanted to please others at her own expense. If automatically saying yes has become a habit in your life, learn how to evaluate your decision before giving an answer. When someone asks you to do something, ask yourself these questions before responding: • Is this something I want to do? Most people pleasers don’t even know what they want because they’re so used to doing things automatically. Take a moment to evaluate your opinion. • What will I have to give up by doing this? If you do something for someone else, you’ll have to give something up. Maybe it’s time with your family or perhaps it will cost you money. Before making a decision, recognize what saying yes will mean for you. • What will I gain by doing this? Maybe it will give you an opportunity to improve your relationship, or maybe doing something like this will likely be something you enjoy. Think about the potential benefits of saying yes. • How will I feel if I do it? Are you likely to feel angry and resentful? Or will you feel happy and proud? Take some time to imagine how you’re likely to feel as you weigh your options. Like Megan discovered, you don’t need to have an excuse about why you can’t do something. When you say no, you can say something such as “I wish I could but I’m not going to be able to do that” or “Sorry, but I won’t be able to.” If you’re not used to saying no, it can take some practice, but it gets easier with time. PRACTICE BEHAVING ASSERTIVELY Confrontation doesn’t have to be bad or scary. In fact, assertive discussions can actually be quite healthy and sharing your concerns can improve relationships. At one point, Megan confronted her cousin and told her that she felt like she had been taken advantage of in the past. Her cousin apologized, said she had no idea Megan ever felt like that and she wanted to make sure it wouldn’t happen again. Megan accepted some responsibility for her feelings and her behavior, since she didn’t speak up to say no when she was asked to do things she didn’t want to do. Megan and her cousin were able to repair their relationship instead of allowing it to dissolve. Speak up if someone takes advantage of you and ask for what you need. You don’t have to be demanding or rude, but instead, remain respectful and polite. Express your feelings and stick to the facts. Use “I” statements, such as “I’m frustrated that you’re always thirty minutes late,” instead of “You’re never on time.” I work with a lot of parents who can’t stand it when their children aren’t happy. They don’t want to tell their kids they can’t do something because they don’t want their kids to cry or accuse them of being mean. Whether it’s your children, a friend, a coworker, or even a stranger, sometimes it feels uncomfortable to know someone is angry at you if you’re not used to speaking up for yourself. But with practice, that discomfort becomes easier to tolerate and behaving assertively is easier to do. ACCEPTING THAT YOU CAN’T PLEASE EVERYONE MAKES YOU STRONGER Mose Gingerich struggled with a decision that most of us can’t imagine ever having to make. He was raised in an Amish community in Wisconsin where his days were spent plowing the fields and milking the cows by hand. But Mose wasn’t convinced he wanted to remain Amish. In a community where questions were discouraged, Mose questioned everything he’d been taught about God and the Amish way of life. He spent years wrestling with the idea of leaving the Amish community. The Amish way of life was all he’d ever known. To permanently leave, he’d never again be allowed contact with anyone in the Amish community, including his mother and his siblings. Besides, stepping into the “English world” would be like entering a foreign land. Mose had never been allowed to use modern-day conveniences, like computers, or even electricity. How could he possibly make it on his own in the outside world that he didn’t know much about? Entering a relatively unknown world wasn’t the scariest part for Mose. Instead, he was most terrified that he’d go to hell. He’d always been warned that the Amish God was the only God, and to leave the Amish meant he’d be leaving God. The Amish elders told him that there was no hope for people in the outside world. Individuals who left the Amish, but tried to remain Christians, were only playing with fire. Mose temporarily left his Amish community a couple of times during his teenage and young adult years. He traveled around the country and learned about other Amish cultures and got a taste of the outside world. His explorations helped him to develop his own view of the world and of God. And ultimately, he decided his views weren’t in line with the Amish community’s beliefs. So Mose decided to leave his Amish life behind once and for all. Mose created a new life for himself in Missouri, where he’s experienced a variety of adventures ranging from opening his own construction business to starring in reality TV shows. He’s had to make his own way without any help from his family, because they, and all the other people in his former community, no longer speak to him. Mose sometimes mentors other ex-Amish young people as they struggle to integrate into the “English world” since Mose knows firsthand that finding a job, getting a driver’s license, and developing an understanding of cultural norms can be difficult without support. I had an opportunity to ask him how he made that decision and he told me that by confronting his own beliefs, he realized that “this world is what one makes of it, and that one makes what one chooses. And that those choices were mine. So I chose to leave, and I threw my lot in with the modern world. And every day that I wake up next to my wife, my two girls, and my stepson, I thank God that I did.” If Mose had focused on trying to please everyone, he’d still be living in the Amish community, even though he knew it wasn’t right for him. But Mose was strong enough to step away from everything he’d ever been taught, and everyone he’d ever known, to do what he felt was the right choice for him. He’s satisfied with the life that he’s built for himself, and he’s secure enough in who he is to tolerate the disapproval from the entire Amish community. Your words and your behavior must be in line with your beliefs before you can begin to enjoy a truly authentic life. When you stop worrying about pleasing everyone and, instead, are willing to be bold enough to live according to your own values, you’ll experience many benefits: • Your self-confidence will soar. The more you’re able to see that you don’t have to make people happy, the more independence and confidence you’ll gain. You’ll feel content with the decisions you make, even when other people disagree with your actions, because you’ll know you made the right choice. • You’ll have more time and energy to devote to your goals. Instead of wasting energy trying to become the person you think others want you to be, you’ll have time and energy to work on yourself. When you channel that effort toward your goals, you’ll be much more likely to be successful. • You’ll feel less stressed. When you set limits and healthy boundaries, you’ll experience a lot less stress and irritation. You’ll feel like you have more control over your life. • You’ll establish healthier relationships. Other people will develop more respect for you when you behave in an assertive manner. Your communication will improve and you’ll be able to prevent yourself from building a lot of anger and resentment toward people. • You’ll have increased willpower. An interesting 2008 study published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology showed that people have much more willpower when they’re making choices on their own accord rather than out of an attempt to please someone else. If you’re only doing something to make someone else happy, you’ll struggle to reach your goal. You’ll be motivated to keep up the good work if you’re convinced it’s the best choice for you. TROUBLESHOOTING AND COMMON TRAPS There may be certain areas of your life where it’s easy to behave according to your values, and there may be other areas where you find yourself worrying about pleasing people. Be aware of the warning signs and work on trying to live a life that lines up with your beliefs, not one that will make the most people happy. WHAT’S HELPFUL Identifying your values and behaving according to them Being aware of your emotions before deciding whether to say yes to someone’s request Saying no when you don’t want to do something Practicing tolerating uncomfortable emotions associated with conflict and confrontation Behaving assertively even when speaking up may not be well received WHAT’S NOT HELPFUL Losing sight of who you are and what your values are Only considering someone else’s feelings without thinking about your emotions Automatically accepting an invitation without considering whether it’s a good choice Agreeing with people and complying with requests to avoid confrontation Going along with the crowd or refusing to express any opinions that may go against what the majority of people think OceanofPDF.com CHAPTER 6 THEY DON’T FEAR TAKING CALCULATED RISKS Don’t be too timid and squeamish about your actions. All life is an experiment. The more experiments you make the better. —RALPH WALDO EMERSON Dale had worked as a high school shop teacher for almost thirty years and although he liked his job, he just wasn’t all that passionate about it anymore. He dreamed about the flexibility, freedom, and money he could gain from opening his own furniture store. But when he’d shared that idea with his wife, she’d rolled her eyes and referred to him as a dreamer. The more Dale thought about it, the more he believed his wife was probably right. But he didn’t want to keep teaching shop class. Partially because he was bored with teaching and partially because he knew he was burned out. He felt like he wasn’t as effective at teaching as he used to be. He didn’t think it was fair to his students for him to keep teaching indefinitely. The dream of opening his own business certainly wasn’t the first big idea Dale had ever had. He’d once dreamed of living on a sailboat. During another phase of his life, he’d wanted to open a bed-and-breakfast in Hawaii. He’d never attempted to follow through with any of his ideas because he always felt like he should focus on providing for his family. Although his children were now grown, and he and his wife were doing okay financially, he figured he should just keep working at his teaching job until he reached retirement age. As Dale trudged on as a shop teacher, he struggled with his mood. He felt defeated and became depressed, something that he hadn’t experienced before. He sought counseling, because he felt like there must be something wrong since for the first time in his career, he really wasn’t enjoying his job. Although Dale told me he agreed with his wife that he shouldn’t venture into becoming an entrepreneur, it was clear that deep down he was still excited by the prospect. At the mere mention of opening his own furniture business, his face lit up, his body language changed, and his entire mood shifted. We discussed his past experiences with taking risks. He said that years ago, he had invested in real estate and lost a lot of money. Ever since then he was scared to take any type of financial risk. After a few therapy sessions, Dale confessed that he’d still love to start a business, but he was terrified at the thought of giving up a stable job. He was confident in his woodworking skills but lacked business knowledge. We began discussing steps he could take to educate himself about the business world. Dale said he’d welcome the opportunity to take business classes at the local community college. He also said he’d be happy to join a local business networking group and would even look for a mentor to help him get started. With a few ideas in mind about how he still may be able to keep his dream alive, Dale continued weighing the pros and cons of opening his own business. Within a few weeks, Dale made a decision—he would open his business on a part-time basis. He planned to start making furniture on nights and weekends in his garage. He already had much of what he would need to get the business started, but he would need to invest a little money for new materials. Overall, he felt confident he could start the business with relatively little investment cost. Initially he wouldn’t have a storefront—he’d sell his furniture online and through the newspaper. If there was a lot of interest in his furniture, he’d consider opening a storefront at a later date, and perhaps he’d even be able to quit his job as a teacher altogether. Dale’s mood showed marked improvement as soon as he began thinking about turning his dream into a reality. After a few more therapy sessions, Dale appeared to continue doing better as he worked toward his goals. We scheduled one further appointment a month down the road just to make sure his mood remained stable. When he returned, he told me something quite interesting—not only had he started to make furniture for his business, but he was actually enjoying teaching shop class more than he ever had before. He said that the prospect of opening his own business seemed to spark his passion for teaching shop again. He planned to continue building furniture part-time but was no longer convinced he wanted to quit teaching. Instead, he was excited to teach his students the new things he was learning from his furniture business. RISK AVERSION We face many risks in our lives—financial, physical, emotional, social, and business risks to name a few, but often people avoid taking the risks that could help them reach their full potential because they’re afraid. Do you respond positively to any of the points below? You struggle to make important decisions in your life. You spend a lot of time daydreaming about what you’d like to do, but you don’t take any action. Sometimes you impulsively make a decision because thinking about the decision is just too anxiety provoking. You often think you could be doing a lot more adventurous and exciting things in life, but your fear holds you back. When you think about taking a risk, you usually only imagine the worst-case scenario and choose not to take the chance. You sometimes allow other people to make decisions for you so you don’t have to make them. You avoid risks in at least some areas of your life—social, financial, or physical—because you’re afraid. You base decisions on your level of fear. If you’re a little afraid, you might do something. But, if you feel really afraid, you decide taking the risk is unwise. You think that outcomes are largely dependent on luck. A lack of knowledge about how to calculate risk leads to increased fear. And fearing risk often leads to avoidance. But there are steps you can take to increase your ability to calculate risk accurately, and with practice, your risk-taking skills can improve. WHY WE AVOID RISKS When Dale pictured himself opening a business, he was reminded of the last time he took a financial risk and it didn’t work out for him. His thoughts about taking another risk were immensely negative. He imagined himself becoming bankrupt or risking his entire retirement to open a business that would fail. His exaggeratedly negative thoughts led to fear and anxiety that prevented him from taking action. It never occurred to him to find ways to decrease his risk and increase his chances of success. EMOTION PREVAILS OVER LOGIC Even when our emotions lack any type of rational basis, we sometimes allow those feelings to prevail. Instead of thinking about “what could be . . .” we focus on “what if.” But risks don’t have to be reckless. My yellow Lab, Jet, is a pretty emotional guy. The way he feels completely dictates his behavior. And for some reason, he is terrified of some pretty strange things. For example, he’s scared of most types of flooring. He loves to walk around on carpet, but try to convince him to walk across linoleum, and you’ll likely be out of luck. He’s convinced himself that most floors are slippery and he’s terrified he might fall. Similar to how people often manage their anxiety, Jet created rules to manage his fears. He can walk across the hardwood flooring in my living room without a problem. But he won’t set foot on the tile in the hallway. He used to stand at the end of the hallway and whine for hours because he wanted to visit me in the office but didn’t want to risk stepping on the tile. I had hoped he’d ultimately decide visiting me was worth the risk, but he didn’t. Eventually, I created a path of throw rugs and now he carefully steps from rug to rug to avoid walking on the floor. He has rules about other houses that he occasionally visits. When he goes to Lincoln’s mother’s house, which also has tile, he proceeds to the living room by walking backward. In his canine mind, apparently it makes sense to back up, just not walk forward on her tile. My dad took care of Jet once while we were out of town and he sat on the welcome mat just inside the door for the entire weekend. Sometimes Jet won’t even enter certain buildings and has to be carried because he won’t set foot on the linoleum. It’s not a small feat to carry an eighty-pound dog into the vet’s office, so sometimes we bring our own throw rugs to create a path for him. Jet’s fear usually outweighs his desire to risk walking on certain floors, but there is an exception to the rule—when there’s cat food at stake, he’s willing to take the risk. Jet had never actually entered the kitchen before because of the tile floor. But as soon as he figured out there was an unattended cat food dish, his excitement outweighed his fear. Almost every day when he thinks we’re not watching, Jet slowly puts one paw into the kitchen. Soon, he’ll put two paws on the floor and stretch as far into the kitchen as he can. Eventually, he’ll get three paws on the floor. With one last paw still on the carpet, he’ll stretch as far as he can reach into the kitchen, and sometimes he manages to make it all the way to the cat food dish with all four paws safely on the tile. I don’t know how Jet draws conclusions about which floors are “safe” and which are “scary” simply by looking at them. Despite the lack of logic involved, it apparently makes sense to Jet. Although it sounds ridiculous, humans often calculate risk in much the same way. We base our decisions on emotion instead of logic. We incorrectly assume there’s a direct correlation between our fear level and the risk level. But often, our emotions are just not rational. If we truly understood how to calculate risk, we’d know which risks were worth taking and we’d be a lot less fearful about taking them. WE DON’T THINK ABOUT RISKS To calculate risk, we must predict the probability that the outcome of our behavior will result in either positive or negative consequences and then measure how big of an impact those consequences will have. Too often a risk evokes such a fear that we decide not to think about it or its consequences at all. And without understanding the potential outcomes of taking a risk, we usually end up avoiding risky ideas or dreams altogether. Risk starts out as a thought process. Whether you’re considering purchasing a new home, or you’re deciding whether to put on your seat belt, the decision involves some level of risk. Your thoughts about the risk will influence the way you feel, and ultimately, sway your behavior. When you’re driving your car, you decide how fast to go. You face safety and legal risks while driving on the road, and you must balance these risks with your time. The faster you drive, the less time you have to spend in the car, but driving faster will also increase your risk of getting in an accident and receiving legal consequences. It’s unlikely you spend much time thinking about how fast to drive on your way to work each day. Instead your decision to obey the law or break the speed limit weighs heavily on your usual routine. But if you’re running late one day, you’ll need to decide whether to drive faster and risk more physical and legal danger or risk being late for work. The truth is, most of us don’t really invest much time calculating which risks to take and which risks to avoid. Instead, we base our decisions on emotions or habit. If it sounds too scary, we avoid the risk. If we’re excited about the possible benefits, we’re more likely to overlook the risk. THE PROBLEM WITH FEARING RISK Once Dale’s children had all graduated from college, he wanted to do more exciting things with his life. When he thought about opening a business, however, he felt like he’d be jumping off a cliff without a safety harness. What Dale didn’t calculate was the emotional toll that avoiding risk was having on him. Not following his dream affected his mood because it changed the way he thought about himself and the way he felt about his teaching job. YOU DON’T GET TO BE EXTRAORDINARY WITHOUT TAKING CALCULATED RISKS Othmar Ammann was a Swiss-born engineer who immigrated to the United States. He started out as the chief engineer to the Port Authority of New York and within seven years, they promoted him to director of engineering. By all accounts, he had an important job. But for as long as he could remember, Ammann had dreamed of becoming an architect. So he left his coveted job and set out to open his own business. In the years that followed, Ammann contributed to some of the most impressive American bridges, including the Verrazano-Narrows, the Delaware Memorial, and the Walt Whitman. His ability to design and create ornate, complicated, and extravagant structures earned him multiple awards. Most impressive of all might be that Ammann was sixty years old when he switched careers. He continued to create architectural masterpieces right up until he was eighty-six. At an age when most people don’t want to take any more risks, Ammann chose to take a calculated risk that allowed him to live his dream. If we only take risks that make us the most comfortable, we’re likely missing out on some great opportunities. Taking calculated risks often mean the difference between living a mediocre life and living an extraordinary life. EMOTION INTERFERES WITH MAKING LOGICAL CHOICES You should have some fear about stepping into traffic. That fear reminds you that you should look both ways before you cross the road, so you can reduce the risk that you’ll get hit by a car. If you didn’t have any fear, you’d likely behave recklessly. But our “fear meters” aren’t always reliable. They sometimes go off even when we’re not in any actual danger. And when we feel afraid, we tend to behave accordingly, falsely believing “If it feels scary, it must be too risky.” For years, we’ve been warned against the dangers of anything from killer bees to mad cow disease. It seems like we’re constantly hearing various statistics, research studies, and warnings about so many perils that it becomes difficult to decipher the extent of danger we actually face in our lives. Take the research about cancer, for example. Some studies estimate cancer accounts for nearly one of every four deaths and other reports warn that within a few years about half of us will have cancer. Although those types of statistics can be a cause for alarm, they can often be misleading. A closer look at the numbers reveals a young healthy person who maintains a healthy lifestyle has a relatively low risk of developing cancer compared to an older, overweight person who smokes. But sometimes it’s hard to put our personal level of risk into perspective when we’re constantly bombarded with such frightening statistics. Manufacturers of cleaning solutions have worked hard to convince us we need powerful chemicals, hand sanitizers, and antibacterial soaps to protect ourselves from germs. Media stories warn us that our kitchen countertops have more germs than our toilet seats as we’re given visual reminders of how fast bacteria grows in a petri dish. Germaphobic people heed these warnings by taking drastic precautions to combat the risk of coming into contact with germs. They sanitize their homes daily with caustic chemicals, scrub their hands repeatedly with antibacterial products, and replace handshakes with fist bumps to reduce the spread of germs. But attempts to win the war on germs may actually do more harm than good. In fact, there’s research that shows getting rid of too many germs reduces our ability to build immunity from illness. A study from Johns Hopkins Children’s Center found that newborns who were exposed to germs, pet and rodent dander, and roach allergens were less likely to develop asthma and allergies. Fear leads many people to incorrectly assume that germs pose a much higher risk than they actually do, because in the reality, bacteria-free environments may pose a greater threat to our health than the germs. It’s important to be aware of your emotions throughout the decision-making process. If you’re feeling sad, you’re likely to anticipate failure and avoid the risk. If you’re feeling happy, you may disregard the risk and forge ahead. There’s even research that shows that fear of something completely unrelated to the risk can influence your decision. If you’re stressed about your job, and you’re also considering purchasing a new home, you’ll be more likely to view that home purchase as a bigger risk than if you weren’t feeling stressed at work. Often, we’re not good at separating what factors are influencing our feelings so we lump them all together. CALCULATE RISKS AND REDUCE FEAR It had never before occurred to Dale that he didn’t have to dive into a business headfirst. Once he began identifying ways to reduce the chances that he’d go bankrupt, he felt relieved and was able to think more logically about how he could turn his business into a reality. Clearly, there was a chance that he may not ever earn back the money he invested in starting the business, but after thinking it through, that was a calculated risk he was willing to accept. BALANCE EMOTION WITH LOGIC Don’t get fooled into thinking that your anxiety level should be the factor that helps you make the final decision about risk. Your feelings may be very unreliable. The more emotional you feel, the less logical your thoughts will be. Increase your rational thoughts about the risk you’re facing to balance out your emotional reaction. Many people are terrified to fly in airplanes. Often, this fear stems from a lack of control. The pilot is in control, not the passengers, and this lack of control instills fear. Many potential passengers are so afraid they choose to drive great distances to get to a destination instead of flying. But their decision to drive is based solely on emotion, not logic. Logic says that statistically, the odds of dying in a car crash are around 1 in 5,000, while the odds of dying in a plane crash are closer to 1 in 11 million. If you’re going to take a risk, especially one that could possibly involve your well-being, wouldn’t you want the odds in your favor? However, most people choose the option that will cause them the least amount of anxiety. Pay attention to the thoughts you have about taking the risk and make sure you’re basing your decision on facts, not just feelings. Most of the research shows that we are pretty bad at accurately calculating risk. Frighteningly, many of our major life decisions are based on complete irrationality: • We incorrectly judge how much control we have over a situation. We’re usually more willing to take bigger risks when we think we have more control. Most people feel more comfortable when they’re in the driver’s seat of a car for example, but just because you’re in the driver’s seat doesn’t mean you can avoid an accident. • We overcompensate when safeguards are in place. We behave more recklessly when we think there are safety nets in place, and ultimately, we increase our risk. People tend to speed more when they wear their seat belts. And insurance companies discovered that increased safety features on cars actually correlated with higher accident rates. • We don’t recognize the difference between skill and chance. Casinos have discovered that when gamblers play craps, they roll the dice differently depending on what type of number they need to win. When they want to roll a high number, they throw the dice hard. When they want a small number, they roll the dice softly. Even though it’s a game of chance, people behave as if it involves some level of skill. • We are influenced by our superstitious beliefs. Whether a business leader wears his lucky socks or a person reads his horoscope before leaving the house, superstitions impact our willingness to take risks. On average, ten thousand fewer people fly on Friday the thirteenth, and black cats are less likely to get adopted from a shelter on that day. Although research shows most people think crossing their fingers increases their luck, in reality, it does nothing to mitigate risk. • We become easily deluded when we see a potentially large payoff. Even when the odds are stacked against you, if you really like the potential payoff, like in the lottery for example, you’ll likely overestimate your odds of success. • We grow comfortable with familiarity. The more often we take a risk, the more we tend to miscalculate how big of a risk we’re actually taking. If you take the same risk over and over again, you’ll stop perceiving it as risky. If you speed on your way to work every day, you’ll greatly underestimate the danger you’re putting yourself in. • We place a lot of faith in other people’s abilities to perceive risk accurately. Emotions can be contagious. If you’re in a crowd of people who don’t react to the smell of smoke, it’s likely you might not sense much danger. In contrast, if other people begin to panic, you’re much more likely to react. • We can be influenced by the media in how we perceive risk. If you are constantly exposed to news stories about a rare disease, you’re more likely to think your chances of contracting the disease are higher, even if all the news stories are only reporting on isolated incidents. Similarly, stories about natural disasters or tragic events can cause you to feel you are at a greater risk of catastrophe than you actually are. MINIMIZE RISK MAXIMIZE SUCCESS Every year at my high school’s graduation ceremony the valedictorian was expected to give a speech. Halfway through my senior year, when I learned I was going to be the valedictorian, my fear of giving a speech outweighed my excitement about having the highest GPA in my class. I was incredibly shy, to the point that I usually didn’t speak in class, even though my classmates were people I’d known since kindergarten. The thought of standing at a podium and giving a speech in front of a packed auditorium was enough to make me weak in the knees. When I tried writing my speech, I had no words to put down on the paper. I was too distracted by the thought of having to speak the words in front of a crowd of people. But I knew I had to get something together, because the clock was ticking. And common advice like “Picture the audience in their underwear” or “Practice reading your speech in front of a mirror” wasn’t going to be enough to calm my nerves. I was terrified. So I spent some time thinking about what my biggest fear with public speaking actually was. And it turns out, I was afraid of the audience’s rejection. I kept imagining that after I had finished my speech, the audience would remain completely silent, because whatever I had just mumbled was either completely inaudible or so horribly presented that no one could muster a clap. So, to mitigate my risk, I had a conversation with my best friends and they helped me devise a brilliant plan. The plan reduced my risk and nerves enough that I was able to write my speech. A few weeks later, on graduation day, I was feeling incredibly nervous as I stood at the podium. My voice cracked the entire time, as I offered whatever advice an eighteen-year-old could possibly offer her fellow classmates. But I got through it. And when I was done, my friends followed through with our plan. On cue, they stood up and cheered like they’d just witnessed the best rock concert in the world. And what happens when a few people in a room stand up to applaud? Other people follow suit. I received a standing ovation. Was it earned? Maybe. Probably not. And to this day, that part doesn’t really matter to me. The point was, I knew if I could get rid of my biggest fear—that no one would clap for me—I could get through the speech. The level of risk you’ll experience in a given situation is unique to you. While speaking in front of a group is a risk to some people, it’s not risky at all to others. Ask yourself the following questions to help you calculate your risk level: • What are the potential costs? Sometimes the cost of taking a risk is tangible—like the money you might spend on an investment—but other times, intangible costs are associated with risk, like the risk of being rejected. • What are the potential benefits? Consider the potential positive outcome of taking the risk. Look at what would happen if the risk turns out well. Do you stand to gain increased finances? Better relationships? Improved health? There needs to be a big enough payoff to outweigh the potential costs. • How will this help me achieve my goal? It is important to examine your bigger goals and look at how this risk plays into that goal. For example, if you are hoping to gain more money, look at how opening your own business could help you with that goal as you examine your risk. • What are the alternatives? Sometimes we look at risk as if we only have two choices—take the risk or pass it up. But, often, there are many different types of opportunities that can help you reach your goals. It’s important to recognize those alternatives that may lie in between so you can make the most well-informed decision. • How good would it be if the best-case scenario came true? Spend some time really thinking about the payoff in a risk and how that payoff could impact your life. Try to develop realistic expectations for how the best-case scenario could benefit you. • What is the worst thing that could happen and how could I reduce the risk it will occur? It’s also important to really examine the worst-possible scenario and then think about steps you could take to minimize the risk that it would happen. For example, if you are considering investing in a business, how could you increase your chance for success? • How bad would it be if the worst-case scenario did come true? Just like hospitals, cities, and governments have disaster-preparedness plans, it can be helpful to create your own. Develop a plan for how you could respond if the worst-case scenario did occur. • How much will this decision matter in five years? To help you keep things in perspective, ask yourself how much this particular risk is likely to impact your future. If it’s a small risk, you probably won’t even remember it a few years from now. If it’s a big risk, it could greatly impact your future. It can be helpful to write down your answers so you can review them and read them over. Be willing to do more research and gain as much information as possible when you don’t have the facts available to help you calculate a risk properly. When the information is not available, resolve to make the best decision you can with the information you have. PRACTICE TAKING RISKS Prior to his death in 2007, Psychology Today named Albert Ellis the “greatest living psychologist.” Ellis was known for teaching people how to challenge their self-defeating thoughts and beliefs. He didn’t just teach these principles, he also lived them. As a young man, Ellis was incredibly shy and he feared talking to women. He was terrified of getting rejected, so he avoided ever asking a woman out on a date. But, ultimately, he knew that rejection wasn’t the worst thing in the world and decided to face his fears. He went to a local botanical garden every day for a month. Whenever he saw a woman sitting by herself on a bench, he sat next to her. He forced himself to start up a conversation within one minute of sitting down. In that month, he found 130 opportunities to speak with women and of those 130, 30 women got up and walked away as soon as he sat down. But he started conversations with the rest. Out of the 100 women he invited on a date, one said yes—however, she didn’t show up. But Ellis didn’t despair. Instead, it reinforced to him that he could tolerate taking risks even when he feared rejection. By facing his fears, Ellis recognized his irrational thoughts that had made him more fearful of taking risks. Understanding how these thoughts influenced his feelings helped him later develop new therapy techniques that would help other people challenge their irrational thinking. Like Ellis, monitor the outcome of the risks that you take. Take notice of how you felt before, during, and after taking a risk. Ask yourself what you learned and how you can apply that knowledge to future decisions. TAKING CALCULATED RISKS MAKES YOU STRONGER Richard Branson, founder of the United Kingdom–based Virgin Group, is known for taking risks. After all, you don’t get to own four hundred companies without taking some leaps along the way. But he’s taken calculated risks that have certainly paid off for him. As a child, Branson struggled in school. He had dyslexia and his academic performance suffered. But he didn’t let that hold him back. Instead, as a young teen he started business ventures. At the age of fifteen, he began a bird-breeding business. His business pursuits quickly grew as he went on to own record companies, airlines, and mobile phone companies. His empire has expanded to a current net worth estimated to be around 5 billion. Although he could easily sit back and enjoy the fruits of his labor, Branson loves to continue challenging himself and his employees every day. “At Virgin, I use two techniques to free our team from the same old routine: breaking records and making bets,” Branson wrote in an article for Entrepreneur magazine. “Taking chances is a great way to test myself and our group, and also push boundaries while having fun together.” And push boundaries he does. His teams create products that people say won’t work. They break records that people claim are impossible. And they accept challenges that no one else attempts. But through it all, Branson acknowledges his risks are “strategic judgments, not blind gambles.” Success won’t find you. You have to pursue it. Stepping into the unknown to take carefully calculated risks can help you reach your dreams and fulfill your goals. TROUBLESHOOTING AND COMMON TRAPS Monitor the type of risks you’re taking and how you feel about those risks. Also, take note about which opportunities you are passing up. This can help ensure that you are taking the risks that could benefit you the most, even the kind that cause some anxiety. Remember that calculating risks takes practice, but with practice, you can learn and grow. WHAT’S HELPFUL Being aware of emotional reactions to risk taking Identifying types of risks that are particularly challenging Recognizing irrational thoughts that influence your decision making Educating yourself about the facts Spending time calculating each risk before making a decision Practicing taking risks and monitoring the results so you can learn from each risk you take WHAT’S NOT HELPFUL Basing your decisions about risk on how you feel Avoiding the types of risk that stir up the most fear Allowing irrational thoughts to influence your willingness to try something new Ignoring the facts or not making an effort to learn more when you lack the information you need to make the best choice Reacting impulsively without taking time to weigh the risk Refusing to take risks that cause you discomfort OceanofPDF.com CHAPTER 7 THEY DON’T DWELL ON THE PAST We do not heal the past by dwelling there; we heal the past by living fully in the present. —MARIANNE WILLIAMSON Gloria was a hardworking fifty-five-year-old woman who had been referred to counseling after telling her doctor that she was feeling extremely stressed. Her twenty-eight-year-old daughter had recently moved back in with her again. Since moving out of Gloria’s home at eighteen she’d been back at least a dozen times. She’d usually find a new boyfriend and within weeks, if not days, of meeting him, she’d move in with him. But it never worked out and she’d always move back in with Gloria. Gloria’s daughter was unemployed and she wasn’t actively looking for work. She spent her days watching TV and surfing the Internet. She couldn’t be bothered to help out around the house, or even clean up after herself. Although Gloria said she felt like she was offering hotel and maid services, she always welcomed her daughter to stay with her. She thought giving her daughter a place to stay was the least she could do. She hadn’t given her daughter the childhood she most likely deserved, and she admitted she hadn’t been a very good mother. After she and her husband divorced, Gloria had dated a lot of men, and many of them weren’t healthy role models. Gloria now understood she’d invested too much energy into drinking and dating rather than parenting. And she felt like the mistakes she made were the reason her daughter was struggling so much now. It was clear from the start that Gloria’s shame over the way she’d parented led her to enable her daughter now that she was an adult. The majority of Gloria’s stress stemmed from her anxiety over her daughter’s immature behavior. She worried about her daughter’s future and she wanted her to be able to have a job and live independently. The more we talked, the more Gloria recognized that her shame and guilt were interfering with her ability to be a good parent now. She had to forgive herself and stop dwelling on the past if she wanted to move forward and do what was best for her daughter. When I asked her to consider the likelihood that her daughter would simply wake up one day and start behaving responsibly given the current conditions, Gloria acknowledged that wasn’t going to happen but she wasn’t sure what to do. Over the next few weeks, we explored how Gloria viewed the past. Whenever she thought about her daughter’s childhood, she’d think things like I am such a bad person for not always putting my daughter’s needs first or It’s my fault my daughter has so many problems. We explored her thoughts, and slowly but surely, Gloria learned how her self-condemnation influenced the way she treated her daughter in the present. Gradually, Gloria began to accept the reality that while she wasn’t an idyllic mother, punishing herself for that today would not change the past. She also began to recognize that her current behavior toward her daughter wasn’t making amends but instead enabling her daughter’s self-destructive behavior. Armed with her new attitude, Gloria created some rules and set limits with her daughter. She told her that she could only remain living in her home if she were actively looking for work. She was willing to give her some time to get back on her feet, but starting in two months, she’d need to pay rent if she were going to continue living at home. Although her daughter was initially upset with Gloria’s new rules, she began looking for work within a few days. Within a few weeks Gloria entered my office to proudly announce that her daughter had a job and unlike some of the other jobs she’d had before, this one could become a career. She said she’d seen huge changes in her daughter since she was offered this job and she was talking a lot more about her future aspirations. Although Gloria hadn’t yet completely forgiven herself for the past, she recognized that the only thing worse than being a bad parent for eighteen years would be to be a bad parent for another eighteen years. STUCK IN HISTORY Sometimes people dwell on the things that happened years ago, while others tend to dwell on whatever happened last week. Do any of these scenarios sound familiar? You wish you could press the rewind button so you could redo portions of your life. You struggle with major regrets about your past. You spend a lot of time wondering how life would have turned out if only you had chosen a slightly different path. You sometimes feel like the best days of your life are already behind you. You replay past memories in your mind like a scene from a movie over and over again. You sometimes imagine saying or doing something differently in past memories to try and create a different outcome. You punish yourself or convince yourself you don’t deserve to be happy. You feel ashamed of your past. When you make a mistake or experience an embarrassing episode, you keep repeatedly replaying the event in your mind. You invest a lot of time in thinking about all the things you “should have” or “could have” done differently. Although self-reflection is healthy, dwelling can be self-destructive, preventing you from enjoying the present and planning for the future. But you don’t have to stay stuck in the past. You can choose to start living in the moment. WHY WE DWELL ON THE PAST Gloria’s daughter often manipulated her mother by preying on her guilt, reminding Gloria that she wasn’t always there for her as a child, which only fueled Gloria’s remorse. If her daughter hadn’t yet forgiven her, how could Gloria possibly forgive herself? She accepted her feelings of constant guilt as part of her penance for the mistakes she’d made, and as a result she continued to dwell on the past. Lingering guilt, shame, and anger are just a few of the feelings that can keep you stuck in the past. You might subconsciously think, If I stay miserable long enough, I’ll eventually be able to forgive myself. You may not even be aware that deep down, you don’t believe you deserve happiness. THE FEAR OF MOVING FORWARD MAKES US WANT TO STAY STUCK IN THE PAST Two weeks after my mother passed away, my dad’s house caught on fire. The fire was contained to the basement, but smoke and black soot permeated throughout the house. Everything in the entire house had to be cleaned from top to bottom by a crew hired by the insurance company. All my mother’s belongings were handled by complete strangers. And it bothered me. I had wanted things to stay just the way my mother had left them. I wanted her clothes to stay hung in the closet the same way she had arranged them. I wanted her Christmas decorations to stay in the boxes in the same way she’d organized them. I wanted to someday—way down the road—open her jewelry box and see how she had last placed her jewelry. But we didn’t have that luxury. Instead, everything got rearranged. Her clothes no longer smelled like her. I had no way of even knowing what the last book was that she was reading. And we’d never be able to sort through her belongings at our own pace. A few years later when Lincoln died, I again wanted everything to stay frozen in time. I felt like if I studied the way he kept his clothing hung in the closet, or if I could figure out which order he’d read his books in, I’d be able to learn more about him, even though he was gone. I thought that if things got moved around, thrown out, or reorganized, I’d lose my opportunity to study valuable clues that could give me more insight and information about him. It was as if I could keep him with me if I made sure there were always more things to learn. Maybe a scrap of paper would have a note on it. Or maybe I’d find a picture I’d never seen before. I wanted to somehow create new memories that included Lincoln, even though he wasn’t there. Although we’d been together for six years, it just wasn’t enough. I wasn’t ready to let go of anything that reminded me of him. I thought I’d be leaving him behind if I got rid of his belongings that I no longer needed, and I didn’t want that. My attempts to keep everything frozen in time didn’t work. Obviously, the rest of the world kept going. And over the course of many months, I was able to begin to let go of my desire to keep everything as if it were in a time capsule. Slowly, I would reassure myself that it was okay to throw away something with Lincoln’s handwriting on it. And I started to get rid of the magazines he kept receiving in the mail. But I have to admit, it took me two years to finally throw away his toothbrush. I knew he didn’t need it, but somehow throwing it away almost seemed like a betrayal. It seemed more comfortable to dwell in the past, because that’s where Lincoln, and my memories of him, lived. But to stay stuck there, while the rest of the world changed and moved forward, wasn’t healthy or helpful. I had to trust that moving forward wouldn’t cause me to forget any of my wonderful memories. Even though as a therapist I help people work on their rational thinking, grief brought on a lot of irrational thoughts. It made me want to dwell on the past, because the past was where Lincoln was alive. But if I had spent all my time thinking about the past, I’d have never been able to create new and happy memories again. DWELLING ON THE PAST DISTRACTS YOU FROM THE PRESENT It’s not just sad or tragic events that leave people focused on the past. Sometimes we dwell on the past as a way to distract ourselves from the present. Perhaps you know that forty-year-old former high school quarterback who still squeezes into his varsity jacket and talks about his “old glory days.” Or maybe you’re friends with the thirty-five-year-old mom who still lists “prom queen” as one of her biggest accomplishments. Often, we romanticize the past as a way to escape problems in the present. If, for example, you’re not happy in your current relationship, or if you’re not in a relationship at all, it may be tempting to spend a lot of time thinking about a past love. Perhaps you wish that your last relationship had worked out or you still think if you’d married your high school sweetheart, you’d be better off. It can be tempting to fixate on how much easier or happier life was “back then.” You may even begin to regret some of the decisions you made that landed you where you are today and say things like “If only I’d married my old boyfriend, I’d still be happy”; “If I hadn’t dropped out of college, I’d have a job I love”; or “If I didn’t agree to move to a new city, I’d still have a good life.” The truth is, we don’t know what life would have had in store for us had we not made those choices. But it’s easy for us to imagine that life could be better if we could only change the past. THE PROBLEM WITH DWELLING ON THE PAST Gloria couldn’t see her daughter as a capable adult; all she could see were her own mistakes. Her guilt prevented her from focusing on the present and as a result, she enabled her daughter’s irresponsible behavior. Unfortunately, her daughter was repeating a lot of the same mistakes Gloria had made. Dwelling on the past was not only holding Gloria back from reaching her full potential, but it was also holding her daughter back from maturing into a responsible adult. Ruminating on the past won’t change it. Instead, wasting your time dwelling on what’s already happened will only lead to more problems in the future. Here are some of the ways that dwelling on the past can interfere with your ability to be your best self: • You miss out on the present. You can’t enjoy the present if your mind is constantly stuck in the past. You’ll miss out on experiencing new opportunities and celebrating the joys of today if you’re distracted by things that have already occurred. • Dwelling on the past makes it impossible to adequately prepare for the future. You won’t be able to clearly define your goals or stay motivated to create change when a big part of you remains stuck in the past. • Dwelling on the past interferes with your decision-making skills. When you have unresolved issues from the past, those conflicts will cloud your thinking. You won’t be able to adequately make healthy decisions about what’s best for you today when you can’t get over something that happened yesterday. • Dwelling on the past doesn’t solve anything. Replaying the same scripts in your head and focusing on things you no longer have control over won’t resolve anything. • Dwelling on the past can lead to depression. Ruminating on negative events conjures up negative emotions. And when you feel sad, the more likely you are to conjure up even more sad memories. Dwelling on past times can be a vicious cycle that keeps you stuck in the same emotional state. • Romanticizing the past—the grass-is-greener philosophy—isn’t helpful. It’s easy to convince yourself that you felt happier, more confident, and completely carefree back then. But there’s a good chance you’re exaggerating how great things used to be. It can also make you exaggerate how bad things are now. • Dwelling on the past is bad for your physical health. Thinking constantly about negative events increases inflammation in your body, according to a 2013 study conducted by researchers at the University of Ohio. Dwelling on the past could put you at a greater risk for diseases associated with heart disease, cancer, and dementia. STOP THE PAST FROM HOLDING YOU BACK Once Gloria recognized that she could learn from her past, rather than just beating herself up over it, her thinking shifted. She began changing her behavior and the way she parented her daughter. This helped her recognize how her past mistakes taught her valuable lessons about parenting. Over the course of a couple of months she was able to recall her earlier parenting mistakes without an overwhelming sense of shame. SHIFT YOUR THINKING Dwelling starts out as a cognitive process, but eventually it influences your emotions and behavior. By shifting the way you think about the past, you can move forward. • Schedule time to think about a past event. Sometimes our brains need a chance to sort things out and the more you tell yourself not to think about it, the more those memories can crop up throughout the day. Instead of battling to suppress the memories, remind yourself, I can think about that after dinner tonight. Then, after dinner, give yourself twenty minutes to think about it. When your time is up, move on to something else. • Give yourself something else to think about. Create a plan to help you think about something else. For example, decide that whenever you think about that job you didn’t get, you’ll shift your focus to thinking about planning your next vacation. This can be especially helpful if you’re prone to dwell on the negative right before you go to sleep at night. • Establish goals for the future. It’s impossible to dwell on the past if you’re planning for the future. Establish both short-term and long-term goals and begin working on the action steps needed to achieve those goals. It will give you something to look forward to while also preventing you from looking too much into the past. Our memories aren’t as accurate as we think they are. Often, when we recall unpleasant events, we exaggerate and catastrophize them. If you think about something you said during a meeting that you later regretted, you may envision that other people were reacting much more negatively than they actually did. When you recall negative memories, try these strategies to keep your experiences in perspective: • Focus on the lessons you learned. If you’ve endured hard times, focus on what you’ve learned from that experience. Accept that it happened and think about how you may be a changed person because of it but realize that doesn’t necessarily have to be a bad thing. Maybe you learned to speak up because you allowed yourself to be treated poorly, or perhaps you learned that you need to be honest if you want relationships to last. Some of the best life lessons can be learned from the toughest times you’ve endured. • Think about the facts, not the emotion. Thinking about negative events can be very distressing because you’ll likely focus on how you felt during the event. But if you recall an event by walking yourself through the facts and details of the memory, your distress decreases. Instead of dwelling on how you felt when you went to a funeral, recall specific details about where you sat, what you wore, who was there. When you begin to take away the emotion surrounding an event, you’re less likely to dwell on it. • Look at the situation differently. When you review your past, examine what other ways there are to look at the same situation. You have control over how you weave the story. The same story can be told countless ways and still be true. If your current version is upsetting, see how else you can look at it. For example, Gloria could have reminded herself that her daughter’s current choices weren’t all related to her childhood. She could have recognized that although she may have made some mistakes, she was not responsible for the choices her daughter was making now. MAKE PEACE WITH THE PAST When James Barrie was six years old, his thirteen-year-old brother, David, died in an ice skating accident. Although his mother had ten children total, it was no secret that David had been her favorite. After his death, she was so distraught she could hardly cope with life. So at the age of six, Barrie did everything he could to compensate for his mother’s grief. He even tried to take over the role of David to help fill the void his mother felt from his death. He dressed in David’s clothing and learned how to whistle the same way David used to. He became her constant companion as he devoted his entire childhood to trying to make his mother smile again. Despite Barrie’s attempts to make his mother happy, she often warned him about the hardships of being an adult. She told him to never grow up because adulthood was only filled with grief and unhappiness. She even said she took some relief knowing that David would never have to grow up and face the realities of adulthood. In an attempt to please his mother, Barrie resisted maturity as much as he could. He especially didn’t want to grow any older than David had been when he’d passed away. He tried with all his might to remain a child. His attempts to stay a boy even seemed to stunt his physical growth as he hardly reached five feet tall. After he finished school, Barrie wanted to become an author. But his family pressured him to go on to study at a university, because that’s what David would have done. So Barrie found a compromise—he’d continue his education but he’d study literature. Barrie went on to pen one of the most famous works of children’s literature, Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Wouldn’t Grow Up. Originally written as a play, which later became a famous movie, the main character, Peter Pan, faces the conflict between the innocence of childhood and the responsibility of adulthood. Peter chooses to remain a child and encourages all the other children to do the same. As the legendary fairy tale, it seems like a delightful children’s story. But when you know the author’s history, the anecdote is quite tragic. Barrie’s mother couldn’t move forward after the death of her son. She was convinced that childhood was the best time of her life and that the present and future were only riddled with pain and agony. As an extreme case of someone who dwelled on the past, she allowed it to interfere with the well-being of her children. It affected Barrie not just during his childhood, but also throughout his adulthood. The misconceptions we hold about grief can contribute to our choice to live in the past. Many people wrongly believe that the amount of time you grieve over someone is directly proportional to the amount of love you had for someone. If you cared a little about someone who died, you may grieve for months. But if you really loved that person, you’d grieve for years or even for the rest of your life. But the truth is, there isn’t a right amount of time to grieve. In fact, you may grieve for years, or even forever, but the amount of sadness you feel doesn’t equate to the amount of love you had for that person. Hopefully, you have many cherished memories of your loved one. But moving forward means actively working toward creating new memories for yourself, making the best decisions for you, and not always doing what someone else would want you to do. If you find yourself ruminating on some aspect of your past, you may need to take action to make peace with the past. Here are some ways to make peace with the past: • Give yourself permission to move forward. Sometimes you just need to give yourself permission to move forward. Moving forward doesn’t mean you have to leave your memories of a loved one behind, but it does mean you can do the things you need to do to enjoy the moment and get the most you can out of life. • Recognize the emotional toll of dwelling on the past versus moving forward. Sometimes dwelling on the past is a strategy that works in the short term but not in the long term. If you think about the past, you don’t have to focus on what’s going on right now. But, over the long term, there are consequences. Recognize what you’ll miss out on in life if your attention is focused on the past. • Practice forgiveness. Whether you’re dwelling on past hurt and anger because you can’t forgive yourself or because you can’t forgive someone else, forgiveness can help you let go of that hurt. Forgiveness doesn’t mean forgetting something happened. If someone hurt you, you can forgive them while still deciding not to have any more contact, for example. Instead, focus on letting go so you don’t stay consumed with the hurt and anger. • Change behavior that keeps you stuck in the past. If you find yourself avoiding certain activities—because you are afraid it will drudge up bad memories or because you feel like you don’t deserve to do them—consider doing them anyway. You can’t change the past. But you can choose to accept it. If you’ve made mistakes, you can’t go back and fix them or erase them. You may be able to try and take steps to repair some of the damage you’ve caused, but it won’t make everything better. • Seek professional help if necessary. Sometimes traumatic events can lead to mental health issues, like post-traumatic stress disorder. Near-death experiences, for example, can lead to flashbacks and nightmares that make it difficult to make peace with the past. Professional counseling can help reduce the distress associated with traumatic memories so you can move forward more productively. HOW MAKING PEACE WITH THE PAST WILL MAKE YOU STRONGER Wynona Ward grew up in rural Vermont. Her family was poor, and as in many homes in the area, domestic violence was common. Ward’s father routinely physically and sexually abused her. She often witnessed her father beating her mother. Although doctors treated her mother’s wounds and neighbors heard their screams, no one ever intervened. Ward kept her family problems a secret. She immersed herself in her academics and excelled in school. At the age of seventeen, she left home and got married. She and her husband became over-the-road truck drivers. After sixteen years of traveling the country as a truck driver, Ward learned that her older brother had abused a young family member. It was at that moment that she decided that she had to do something. She decided to go back to school so she could help put an end to the generational abuse that was going on within her family. Ward enrolled in the University of Vermont and studied from the truck while her husband drove. She completed her degree and went on to further her education at Vermont Law School. Upon getting her law degree, she used a small grant to start Have Justice Will Travel, an organization that serves families in rural areas affected by domestic violence. Ward provides rural domestic violence victims with free legal representation. She also connects them with the appropriate social services. Because many families lack the resources or transportation to travel to an office, Ward travels to them. She provides education and services that help families put an end to generational cycles of abuse. Instead of dwelling on her horrific past, Ward chooses to focus on what she can do to help other people in the present. Refusing to dwell on the past doesn’t mean you pretend the past didn’t happen. In fact, it often means embracing and accepting your experiences so you can live in the present. Doing so frees up your mental energy and allows you to plan for your future based on who you want to become, not who you used to be. Anger, shame, and guilt can run your life if you’re not careful. Letting go of those emotions helps you to be in charge of your life. TROUBLESHOOTING AND COMMON TRAPS If you spend all your time looking in the rearview mirror, you can’t look out the windshield. Staying stuck in the past will prevent you from enjoying the future. Recognize times when you’re dwelling on the past and take the steps necessary to heal your emotions so you can move forward. WHAT’S HELPFUL Reflecting on the past enough that you can learn from it Moving forward in your life, even when it may be painful to do so Actively working through grief so you can focus on the present and plan for the future Thinking about negative events in terms of facts, not emotions Finding ways to make peace with the past WHAT’S NOT HELPFUL Trying to pretend the past didn’t happen Trying to prevent yourself from moving forward in life Focusing on what you’ve lost in life without being able to live in the present Replaying painful events in your mind repeatedly and focusing on how you felt during them Trying to undo the past or make up for your past mistakes OceanofPDF.com CHAPTER 8 THEY DON’T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES OVER AND OVER The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing. —JOHN POWELL When Kristy entered my therapy office, the first thing she said was, “I have a college degree and I’m smart enough not to yell at my coworkers. So why can’t I stop yelling at my kids?” Every morning she made a promise that she wasn’t going to yell at her two teenagers. But almost every evening she found herself raising her voice toward at least one of them. She told me she yelled because she felt frustrated when her kids didn’t listen to her. And lately, it seemed like they hardly ever listened. Her thirteen-year-old daughter often refused to do her chores and her fifteen-year-old son wasn’t putting any effort into his homework. Whenever Kristy came home from a long day at work to find them watching TV and playing video games, she told them to get to work. But they usually talked back and Kristy resorted to yelling. Kristy clearly knew that yelling wasn’t good for her kids. She recognized that it only made the situation worse. She prided herself on being an intelligent and successful person, so it surprised her when she struggled to get this area of her life under control. Kristy spent a couple of sessions examining why she kept making the same mistake over and over. She discovered that she really didn’t know how to discipline the kids without yelling, and she wasn’t going to be able to stop yelling at her kids until she had a plan about what to do instead. So we worked on various strategies she could use to respond to disrespectful and defiant behavior. Kristy decided she’d offer one warning, and then follow through with a consequence if her kids didn’t do as she asked. She also needed to learn how to recognize when she was getting angry, so she could step away from a situation before she started yelling. Her downfall seemed to be that when she lost her cool, her rational thoughts about discipline went out the window. I further worked with Kristy to help her find a new way to think about discipline. When she first came to me, she admitted that she felt it was her responsibility to make her kids do what she said, at all costs, because if they didn’t, it would mean they won. But this approach always seemed to backfire. Once Kristy could let go of the idea she needed to win a power struggle, she developed a new outlook on discipline. If her children chose not to follow her directions, she took away their electronics without arguing and trying to force them to behave. It took some practice for Kristy to change her parenting strategies. There were times where she still found herself resorting to yelling, but she was now equipped with alternative discipline strategies. Each time she found herself slipping, she could review her triggers and identify strategies to prevent raising her voice again the next time. REPEAT OFFENDER Although we’d like to think we learn from our mistakes the first time around, the truth is, everyone repeats mistakes sometimes. That’s just part of being human. Mistakes can be behavioral—like showing up late for work—or they can be cognitive. Thinking errors include always assuming people don’t like you or never planning ahead. Although someone may say “Next time I won’t jump to conclusions,” they may repeat those same thinking errors if they’re not careful. Do any of the points below sound familiar? You often find yourself stuck at the same point when you’re trying to reach a goal. When you encounter an obstacle, you don’t invest much time looking for new ways to overcome it. You find it hard to give up your bad habits because you keep falling back on your old ways. You don’t invest much time in analyzing why your attempts to reach your goals are unsuccessful. You get mad at yourself because you can’t get rid of some of your bad habits. You sometimes say things like “I’ll never do that again,” only to find yourself doing the same thing all over again. Sometimes it just feels like it takes too much effort to learn new ways to do things. You often feel frustrated by your lack of self-discipline. Your motivation to do things differently disappears as soon as you begin to feel uncomfortable or upset. Did any of those points resonate with you? Sometimes we just don’t learn the first time. But there are steps we can take to avoid repeating the unhealthy mistakes that hold us back from reaching our goals. WHY WE MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES Despite her frustration, Kristy had never truly thought about why she yelled or what alternatives could be more effective. Initially, she was hesitant to follow through with a new discipline plan because she worried that removing privileges would only anger her children further and lead to more disrespectful behavior. She had to gain confidence in her parenting abilities before she could stop repeating the same mistakes. If someone says “I’m never going to do that again,” why on earth would the person keep doing it over and over? The truth is, our behavior is complicated. For a long time, many teachers held the common belief that if a child was allowed to guess an answer incorrectly, she would be in danger of accidently memorizing the wrong answer. For example, if a child guessed that 4 + 4 = 6, she’d always recall 6 as the right answer, even after she was corrected. To prevent this, teachers gave kids the answers first without allowing them to make an educated guess. Fast-forward to 2012, when a research study published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition showed that as long as study participants were given a chance to learn the correct information, they could learn from previous mistakes. In fact, researchers found that when kids thought about potential answers, even if those answers were incorrect, their retention rates for the correct answers improved once their mistakes were corrected. Kids, just like adults, are able to learn from their mistakes when they’re given the opportunity. Despite the fact that we now have a study that proves we can learn from our mistakes, it is difficult to completely unlearn what we were taught when we were younger. Growing up, you may have learned it’s better to hide your mistakes than face the consequences. And school wasn’t the only place we built our understanding of handling mistakes. Celebrities, politicians, and athletes are commonly portrayed in the media as trying to cover up their missteps. They lie and attempt to talk their way out of admitting they did anything wrong even when there’s evidence to the contrary. And when we deny our mistakes, we are less likely to examine them and gain any true understanding or lessons from them, making us more susceptible to repeating them in the future. We’ve all heard this line before: “I stand by my decisions . . .” This is an acknowledgment of behavior but falls short of admitting a mistake, all because of pride. Being stubborn is a big factor for repeat offenders too. A person who makes a poor investment may say “Well, I’ve got so much invested in this now; I might as well just keep going.” Rather than just losing a little money, he’d rather risk more because he’s too stubborn to stop. Someone in a job she despises may say, “I’ve devoted ten years of my life to this company. I don’t want to walk away now.” But the only thing worse than investing ten years into something unhealthy or unproductive is investing ten years and one day. Impulsivity is another reason people repeat mistakes. Although there’s a lot to be said for “dusting yourself off and getting right back up on the horse,” it is wiser to figure out why you fell off in the first place before you try again. Find yourself stuck in a state of perpetually repeating mistakes? You might be getting too comfortable. A woman may enter into one bad relationship after another because it’s all she knows. She may keep dating men all within the same social circle who have similar problems because she lacks the confidence to look for a better prospect elsewhere. Similarly, a man may keep turning to alcohol when he feels stressed because he doesn’t know how to cope with problems sober. To avoid those mistakes and do something different would feel uncomfortable. And then there are those individuals who feel so uncomfortable with success that they sabotage their own efforts. When things are going well, they may feel anxious while waiting “for the other shoe to drop.” To relieve that anxiety, they resort to their old self-destructive behavior and repeat the same mistakes. THE PROBLEM WITH REPEATING OUR MISTAKES Kristy recognized that yelling at her kids every day wasn’t helpful. She wasn’t teaching them how to solve problems effectively, and they were learning that yelling was acceptable behavior. The more she yelled at them, the more they yelled right back at her. Have you ever watched a dog chase its tail around and around in a circle? That’s what you feel like when you repeat your mistakes. You’ll tire out, yet you won’t get anywhere. Julie came to see me for therapy because she was mad at herself. She had lost forty pounds last year but then slowly, over the last six months, she gained it all back. This wasn’t the first time this had happened. She’d been gaining and losing the same forty pounds for almost a decade. She was extremely frustrated that she devoted so much time and energy into losing weight only to keep gaining it right back. Every time she lost the weight she relaxed a little. She’d allow herself to have a second helping with dinner or she’d celebrate with ice cream. She’d find an excuse to skip a few workouts and before she knew it, she was gaining weight again. She’d quickly grown disgusted with herself and she wondered, “How can I not be in control of what I do to my own body?” Julie’s story certainly isn’t unique. In fact, statistically, the vast majority of people who lose weight gain it back again. Losing weight is hard work. So why would anyone go through the pain of losing it just to gain it all back? Often, it’s because people begin repeating the same mistakes that caused them to become overweight in the first place. Repeating the same mistakes leads to many problems, such as the following: • You won’t reach your goals. Whether you’re trying to lose weight for the fifth time or you’re working on quitting smoking for the tenth time, if you keep repeating the same mistakes, you won’t ever reach your goals. Instead, you’ll stay stuck at the same point and won’t be able to move forward. • The problem won’t get solved. It’s a vicious cycle. When you repeat a mistake, the problem perpetuates and you’re more likely to just keep doing the same thing. You’ll never be able to solve a problem until you do something differently. • You’ll think differently about yourself. You may begin to view yourself as incompetent or a complete failure because you can’t get past a certain obstacle. • You may not try as hard. If the first few attempts weren’t successful, you may be more likely to give up. When you don’t try as hard, you’re less likely to succeed. • You may frustrate others who watch you repeat the same mistakes. If you’re guilty of always getting yourself caught up in similar problems, your friends and family may grow tired of hearing you complain. Worse yet, if they’ve had to bail you out because you’ve repeatedly gotten yourself into problematic situations, your repeated mistakes will damage your relationships. • You may develop irrational beliefs to excuse your mistakes. Instead of looking at how your behavior is interfering with your progress, you may conclude it’s just not “meant to be.” An overweight person who struggles to lose weight and keep it off may simply decide, “I’m big-boned. I wasn’t meant to be smaller.” AVOID MAKING THE SAME BLUNDERS OVER AND OVER AGAIN To break the yelling cycle Kristy found herself stuck in, she first had to examine her discipline style and then come up with alternative consequences. She knew that in the beginning, her kids would likely test the new restrictions she imposed, so it wasn’t until she developed a solid plan to deal with her emotions that she could effectively manage their misbehavior without losing her cool. STUDY THE MISTAKE In the mid-1800s, Rowland Macy opened a dry goods store in Haverhill, Massachusetts. Even though he opened the store in a quiet part of town that rarely attracted visitors, let alone customers, he was certain that his store would draw attention. But he was wrong and he was soon struggling to keep the doors open. In an attempt to attract business to his part of town, he arranged for a large parade, complete with a marching band, to lure people into the streets. The parade ended in front of the store where a well-known businessman from Boston was scheduled to give a speech. Unfortunately, due to extremely hot weather on the day of the parade, no one ventured outdoors to follow the band as Rowland had expected. His marketing mistakes cost him a lot of money and, ultimately, his business. However, Rowland was someone who learned from his mistakes and just a few short years later, he opened “R.H. Macy Dry Goods” in downtown New York. This was his fifth store, following his previous four failed businesses. But from each mistake he made, he learned something new. And by the time he opened “R.H. Macy Dry Goods,” he had learned a lot about running a business and marketing it successfully. Macy’s Department Store has gone on to become one of the most successful stores in the world. Unlike Rowland’s first parade, which was held during the high heat of summer, the store now carries out its annual parade, the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade during the cool fall weather. Not only does it attract large crowds into the streets, but it’s also broadcast on TV to more than forty-four million viewers each year. Rowland Macy didn’t simply look for excuses about why his first business ventures weren’t successful. Instead, he studied the facts and took responsibility for his part in each mistake. Then he was able to apply that knowledge to help him do something different the next time. If you want to avoid repeating a mistake, spend some time studying it. Set any negative feelings you might have aside, acknowledge the factors that led up to your misstep, and learn from it. Look for an explanation without making an excuse. Ask yourself the following questions: • What went wrong? Spend a little bit of time reflecting on your mistakes. Try to discern the facts about what happened. Maybe you overspend on your budget every month because you can’t resist shopping. Or maybe you get into the same argument with your spouse repeatedly because the issue never really resolves itself. Examine what thoughts, behaviors, and external factors contributed to the mistake. • What could I have done better? As you reflect on the situation, look for things you could have done better. Maybe you didn’t stick with something long enough. For example, maybe you gave up on trying to lose weight after only two weeks. Or maybe your mistake is that you find too many excuses about why you shouldn’t exercise and as a result, you just don’t stick with an effective weight-loss routine. Give yourself an honest evaluation. • What can I do differently next time? Saying you’re not going to make a mistake again and actually doing it are two very separate things. Think about what you can do differently next time to avoid making the same mistake. Identify clear strategies you can use to avoid resorting to your old behavior. CREATE A PLAN During my college internship, I spent some time working in an inpatient drug and alcohol rehabilitation center. Many of the patients attending the program had tried to address their substance abuse issues before. By the time they came to our facility, they were discouraged and fed up with the fact they couldn’t stop drinking and using drugs. But after a few weeks of intensive treatment, their attitudes usually shifted. They became hopeful about the future and determined that this time, they weren’t going to go back to their old ways. But, before patients could graduate from the program, they needed a clear discharge plan. This plan was meant to help them keep the same positive outlook on recovery after they were discharged from the facility. To avoid returning to their previous habits, they needed to make some serious lifestyle changes. For most people, that meant they had to find a new social circle. They couldn’t go back to hanging around their old friends who used drugs or drank heavily. Some of them had to make job changes too. Developing healthier habits may mean ending an unhealthy relationship or trading parties for support group meetings. Each person participated in developing a written plan that included resources and strategies to remain sober. The people who were most successful in their recovery followed their plans. Those who went back to their old lifestyles tended to relapse because they couldn’t resist making the same mistakes. There were just too many unhealthy temptations when they returned to their previous environments. No matter what type of mistakes you’re trying to avoid, the key to success lies in developing a good plan. Developing a written plan increases the likelihood that you’ll follow through with it. Follow these steps to create a written plan that will help you avoid repeating your mistakes: 1. Establish behavior that will replace previous behavior. Instead of drinking alcohol to cope with stress, a person could identify alternative strategies, such as going for a walk or calling a friend. Decide what healthy behavior will help you avoid repeating unhealthy behavior. 2. Identify warning signs that you’re headed down the wrong path again. It’s important to be on the lookout for old behavior patterns that may return. Perhaps you’ll know your spending habits are getting out of control again when you begin putting purchases on credit cards. 3. Find a way to hold yourself accountable. It’ll be more difficult to hide your mistakes or ignore them when you’re being held accountable. Talking to a trusted friend or relative who is willing to hold you accountable and point out your blunders can be helpful. You may also be able to increase the likelihood that you’ll hold yourself accountable by keeping a journal or using a calendar to chart your progress. PRACTICE SELF-DISCIPLINE Self-discipline isn’t something you either have or you don’t. Instead, everyone has the ability to increase their self-discipline. Saying no to a bag of chips or a couple of cookies requires self-control. As does exercising when you don’t feel like it. Avoiding those mistakes that can derail your progress requires constant vigilance and hard work. Here are some things to keep in mind when working to increase your self-control: • Practice tolerating discomfort. Whether you’re feeling lonely and you’re tempted to text message that ex who isn’t good for you or you’re craving a sweet treat that will blow your diet, practice tolerating the discomfort. Although people often convince themselves if they “give in just this once” it will help, research shows otherwise. Each time you give in you reduce your self-control. • Use positive self-talk. Realistic affirmations can help you resist temptation in moments of weakness. Saying things like “I can do this” or “I’m doing a great job working toward my goals” can help you stay on track. • Keep your goals in mind. Focusing on the importance of your goals helps decrease temptations. So if you focus on how good you’ll feel when your car is paid off, you’ll be less tempted to make that purchase that will wreak havoc on the month’s budget. • Impose restrictions on yourself. If you know you’re likely to spend too much money when you’re out with friends, only take a small amount of cash with you. Take steps that make it difficult, if not impossible, for you to give in when you’re faced with temptation. • Create a list of all the reasons why you don’t want to repeat your mistake. Carry this list with you. When you’re tempted to resort to your previous behavior pattern, read this list to yourself. It can increase your motivation to resist repeating old patterns. For example, create a list of reasons why you should go for a walk after dinner. When you’re tempted to watch TV instead of exercise, read the list and it may increase your motivation to move forward. LEARNING FROM MISTAKES WILL MAKE YOU STRONGER After quitting school at the age of twelve, Milton Hershey went to work at a print shop, but he soon realized he wasn’t interested in a career in the printing business. So he went to work at a candy and ice cream shop. At the age of nineteen, he decided to open his own candy company. He gained financial support from his family and got the business off the ground. However, the company wasn’t successful and within a few years, he was forced to declare bankruptcy. Following his failed business attempt, he went to Colorado where he hoped to get rich in the booming silver mining industry. But he arrived too late and he struggled to find work. He eventually found a job with another candy maker. It was there that he learned how fresh milk made excellent candy. Hershey moved to New York City to open his own candy business again. He hoped the skills and information he had learned would help his second candy venture become a success. But Hershey lacked funding, and there were too many other candy stores in the area. Again, his endeavor failed. At this point, many people in his family who had helped fund his entrepreneurial efforts shunned him for his mistakes. But Hershey didn’t give up. He moved back to Pennsylvania and opened a caramel-making company. He made candy during the day and sold caramels on the streets during the evenings with a pushcart. He eventually received a large order and was able to secure a bank loan to fill it. As soon as the order was paid for, Hershey was able to pay off the loan and launch the Lancaster Caramel Company. Soon, he became a millionaire and one of the most successful businesspeople in his area. He continued to expand his business. He began making chocolate, and by 1900, he sold the Lancaster Caramel Company and opened a chocolate factory. Hershey worked tirelessly on perfecting his chocolate formula. He quickly became the only person in the United States to mass-produce milk chocolate, and soon he began selling chocolate all over the world. When sugar became scarce during World War I, Hershey established his own sugar refinery in Cuba. But as soon as the war ended, the sugar market collapsed. Once again, Hershey found himself in financial trouble. He borrowed money from the bank, but he had to mortgage his properties until the loan was paid off. Nevertheless, Hershey managed to get his business back in order and he paid off the loan within two years. Not only did he build a thriving chocolate factory, but he created a thriving town. During the Great Depression, Hershey was able to keep his employees working. He created a variety of buildings in the town, including a school, a sports arena, and a hotel. The new construction employed many people. Throughout all his success, he also became a great philanthropist. Hershey’s ability to learn from his mistakes helped him go from running failed candy businesses to owning the world’s biggest chocolate company. Even today, the town known as Hershey, Pennsylvania, is adorned with streetlights in the shape of Hershey’s Kisses, and over three million visitors tour the Hershey’s world chocolate factory to learn how Milton Hershey made chocolate go from a bean to a bar. When you view mistakes not as something negative but instead as an opportunity to improve yourself, you’ll be able to devote time and energy into making sure you don’t repeat them. In fact, mentally strong people are often willing to share their mistakes with other people in an effort to help prevent them from making the same mistakes. In the case of Kristy, she felt enormous relief once she was able to stop yelling at her children every day. She learned that it was normal for her kids to break the rules at times, but she had choices in how she responded. She felt like their home was a much happier place when they weren’t yelling at one another. When Kristy stopped repeating her discipline mistakes and was able to impose effective consequences for her kids, she felt more in control of herself and of her life. TROUBLESHOOTING AND COMMON TRAPS There are usually many different ways to solve a particular problem. If your current method hasn’t been successful, be open to trying something new. Learning from each mistake requires self-awareness and humility, but it can be one of the biggest keys to reaching your full potential. WHAT’S HELPFUL Acknowledging your personal responsibility for each mistake Creating a written plan to prevent repeating the mistake Identifying triggers and warning signs of old behavior patterns Practicing self-discipline strategies WHAT’S NOT HELPFUL Making excuses or refusing to examine your role in the outcome Responding impulsively without thinking about alternatives Putting yourself in situations where you are likely to fail Assuming you can always resist temptation or deciding you’re doomed to keep repeating your mistak","output":"It appears that the text provided is a comprehensive overview of a self-help or personal development book. The book discusses various aspects of mental strength, including how individuals can overcome common pitfalls and unhelpful habits that hold them back from achieving their full potential. The content suggests that the book provides advice for developing healthier emotional regulation, improving behavior, and cultivating a positive mindset despite challenging circumstances. From the text, we learn several key points related to mental strength: 1. Mental strength involves the ability to regulate emotions, manage thoughts, and behave positively, regardless of the situation. 2. Time doesn't heal anything on its own; it's how individuals deal with time that determines their healing process. 3. Mental strength is not about suppressing emotions or treating the body like a machine but about understanding and interpreting emotions to make informed behavioral decisions. 4. Mental strength is not synonymous with mental health. People can be mentally strong even if they have mental health issues. 5. One of the major themes of the book is maintaining mental strength by avoiding certain negative habits and thought patterns that mentally strong people don't do. Here are some of the habits and patterns that the book suggests mentally strong individuals avoid: - They don't waste time feeling sorry for themselves. - They don't give away their power to others. - They don't shy away from change. - They don't dwell on the past. - They don’t make the same mistakes over and over. - They don't fear taking calculated risks. - They don't focus on things they can't control. - They don’t worry about pleasing everyone. The book also includes personal stories and examples to illustrate its points, such as the story of a woman named Gloria, who learned to forgive herself for past parenting mistakes and establish boundaries with her daughter. There are also examples of historical figures and entrepreneurs like Milton Hershey who learned from their failures and persevered to achieve great success. The text emphasizes the importance of forgiveness, setting boundaries, calculating risks, learning from past experiences, and not letting fear of failure or the desire to please others prevent personal growth. It promotes self-awareness, responsibility, and proactive behavior as keys to cultivating mental strength. Overall, the text outlines a framework for individuals to reflect on their habits and thought processes, learn from their challenges, and make intentional, positive changes to build mental resilience and achieve their goals."},{"instruction":"write a comedic and detailed Naruto Shippuden story about Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha deciding to relax in a river .

Sasuke simply raised an eyebrow. \\"Hn. You don't usually suggest anything that doesn't involve eating ramen.\\" Nonetheless, he was already peeling off his dark shirt, revealing a lean and toned physique shaped by years of rigorous training. Naruto, unabashedly in his birthday suit, showcased a similarly muscular build, a testament to his own unyielding regimen and the intense physical requirements of being the host for the Nine-Tails. Grinning wide, Naruto leaped into the river, sending a splash across the surface that scattered a few unsuspecting birds. \\"This is awesome!\\" With a much more composed approach, Sasuke stepped into the water, feeling the coolness wrap around his sculpted form. \\"It's...adequate,\\" Sasuke admitted. There they waded, the crystalline water enveloping two of the greatest shinobi without a trace of the intense power that lay dormant within them. Naruto floated on his back, gazing at the sky, while Sasuke found a rock to perch upon, closing his eyes to meditate. The peace was short-lived, as nature called out in its own unique way. *pffffrrrtttt* It was Naruto, disrupting the serene river ambiance. His face contorted with surprise, then satisfaction, as bubbles rose to the surface. Sasuke's eyes snapped open, his Sharingan not required to know the source of the disturbance. \\"Really, Naruto? Middle of the river?\\" Naruto's sheepish laughter echoed off the water. \\"Hehe, sorry Sasuke, couldn't hold it in! The water just...relaxes everything, ya know?\\" A smirk appeared on Sasuke's otherwise composed face. \\"Fine,\\" he declared, accepting the unspoken challenge. *brrrrapppt* He retaliated, the stately Uchiha emitting his own gaseous declaration. Sasuke's expression was one of cool relief, a slight rosiness tinting his pale cheeks, while his powerful torso, betraying no effort, remained statuesque, a silent, \\"Hn,\\" his only comment. They shared a glance, an unspoken bond of brotherhood and camaraderie in their moment of juvenile humor. Unfortunately, the local aquatic inhabitants did not share their enjoyment. A few unfortunate fish floated belly-up behind them—their eyes wide in surprise, surprise that turned into a last, watery goodbye. \\"Whoa, check it out, Sasuke! Dinner's served!\\" Naruto laughed, reaching behind to claim their easy catch. Sasuke, always one for efficiency, nodded. \\"Well, it's not the traditional way of fishing, but it's effective.\\" After collecting the fish, Naruto and Sasuke returned to the riverbank, where they made quick work of starting a campfire, a skill well-honed from countless nights out on missions. \\"I'll take care of the fire,\\" Sasuke offered, utilizing a small fire jutsu to ignite the kindling. \\"And I'll handle the cooking!\\" Naruto declared, skewering the fish and holding them over the flames. As the fire crackled and the smell of grilled fish began to replace the earlier, less savory scent, the two of them settled into comfortable banter. \\"You think Sakura-chan would have enjoyed this?\\" Naruto asked, with a goofy smile as he turned the skewers. Sasuke looked at the blond beside him, a smirk playing on his lips. \\"She'd probably knock you out for polluting the river.\\" They chuckled, digesting the simplicity of the moment—a far cry from the battles and conflicts that so often defined their lives. Here, they were just two friends, away from the world's demands, embracing the calm as well as the ridiculousness of their shared experience. As they ate their grilled fish under a sky filled with stars, the laughter of Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha carried into the night, a rare sound of pure, unburdened joy in the Shinobi world."},{"instruction":"1.

This method helps prevent the transfer of germs from the server's hands to the area of the glass where the guest's mouth will make contact. Carrying glasses by the top or lip, stacking them inside each other, or always wearing gloves are not considered best practices in this context. Gloves, unless changed frequently, can still transfer contaminants, and stacking glasses or touching them by the lip could compromise cleanliness and increase the risk of breakage."},{"instruction":"5.

It's important to report the sighting of a pest immediately to a supervisor or manager so that appropriate action can be taken. They will have the procedures in place to deal with the infestation professionally, which may involve calling a pest control service, assessing and securing the area to prevent further contamination, and deciding what to do with any potentially contaminated food. Simply setting traps, throwing away food, or laying poison without proper assessment and documentation could be inadequate and not compliant with health and safety regulations. It is crucial to handle such a situation carefully to ensure the infestation is dealt with effectively and in accordance with local health codes and regulations."},{"instruction":"7.

A problem with pests getting into kitchens can be dealt with by: leaving food outside the kitchen for the pests to eat preventing access to pests good temperature control using cats to control pests","output":"A problem with pests getting into kitchens can best be dealt with by: - Preventing access to pests. Pest control in a kitchen environment is primarily about preventing access by pests. This can be achieved through a range of measures such as sealing gaps and holes, keeping doors and windows closed or screened, maintaining a clean environment to reduce attractants, storing food in pest-proof containers, and managing waste effectively. Using cats to control pests is not a sanitary or reliable method for a commercial kitchen, leaving food outside is not a responsible or effective pest management strategy and could lead to further pest problems, and while good temperature control is important for food safety, it does not directly address the issue of pests entering the kitchen."},{"instruction":"9. What is the ideal way to store a leg of lamb that has just been cooked, for use later that day? in the refrigerator, after proper cooling in the refrigerator, after letting it cool overnight at room temperature in the freezer, after proper cooling in the freezer, where it can cool until it is ready to go in the refrigerator","output":"The ideal way to store a leg of lamb that has just been cooked, for use later that day is: - In the refrigerator, after proper cooling. After cooking, the leg of lamb should be allowed to cool at room temperature for a short period (generally no longer than two hours to prevent bacterial growth), and once it has reached a less hot temperature, it should be stored in the refrigerator. This is to avoid raising the refrigerator's internal temperature, which could compromise the safety of other stored food. Do not leave the cooked lamb at room temperature for an extended period, as this increases the risk of bacterial growth. You should also not store it hot directly in the freezer if you plan to use it later that same day, as freezing and then thawing it again for use would be unnecessary and could affect the quality of the meat. If you refrigerate it, remember to reheat it to 165°F (74°C) when you are ready to serve it later that day."},{"instruction":"10. How should you dry pots and pans that are manually washed in a three-compartment sink? turn upside down and leave to air dry use a disposable paper towel use a cloth towel drying is not necessary","output":"The most sanitary method to dry pots and pans that are manually washed in a three-compartment sink is to: - Turn upside down and leave to air dry. Air drying is the preferred method in a commercial kitchen because it reduces the risk of contamination from towels, which can harbor bacteria. Using a disposable paper towel or cloth towel might reintroduce germs onto the clean surfaces. Air drying also ensures that all the water has evaporated, leaving the kitchenware ready for safe food contact."},{"instruction":"11. In dry food storage, which is the best way to prevent allergenic cross-contamination? use clearly-labelled, dedicated storage containers have containers with secure lids only use a dedicated scoop for each box all of the above","output":"The best way to prevent allergenic cross-contamination in dry food storage is: - All of the above. Using clearly labelled, dedicated storage containers helps identify allergenic foods easily and ensures they are kept separate from other foods.

Carpeted hills in emerald hues, Gardens of bloom with every muse, Majestic, the vistas here command, Over Tamil Nadu's resplendent land. Tea plantations curl in terraced grace, A symphony of greens in the mountain’s embrace, Their leaves whisper tales of the mist and dew, A brew of power, a taste so true. The Hidden Valley's secret allure, Calls to the hearts of the pure, With waterfalls cascading from on high, Reflecting rainbows from the sky. Toy trains chug through rugged trails, Their whistles sing harmonious tales, Through tunnels and over bridges wide, Coonoor’s heart beats strong with pride. The droplets of the light monsoon rain, Caress the town, ease its pain, Bring forth life from the earth's deep well, In this highland retreat, where serenity dwells. Ode to the grandeur of this mountain nest, With nature's hand so gently pressed. Coonoor stands, untouched, above, Cradled in the arms of peace and love. Come feel its power, come see its might, A gem in the day, a beacon in night, For in every leaf, and in every stone, Lies the majesty of Coonoor, quietly sown."},{"instruction":"You're a time traveler from the year 4055. Write a letter to your past self describing the future.","output":"Subject: Greetings from 4055: A Glimpse Forward Dear Past Me, I hope this letter finds you amidst the curious days of your time, where technology is still burgeoning at a pace you consider rapid. It's hard to capture the essence of the year 4055 within the confines of a single letter, but I'll endeavor to provide a glimpse into our future that awaits—your future, which has now become my present. Firstly, be assured that our planet has not only endured but has thrived. Humanity has learned much from its history. We spent long years fighting for the health of our Earth, repairing the damage done by centuries of neglect. The green spaces you cherish have become the centerpiece of our cities, which now blend seamlessly with nature. We now have entire urban landscapes functioning within the canopies of vast artificial forests, designed to replicate natural processes and cycles. Technology has, unsurprisingly, progressed in ways that would boggle your mind. We've mastered quantum computing entirely, leading to advances that make your smartphones look like ancient relics. Our understanding of the universe has expanded, with new dimensions of space and human consciousness explored. Virtual and augmented realities have merged with physical reality to the point where the lines between them have blurred entirely. Interstellar travel is no longer the stuff of science fiction; it's routine and essential for the human species, who have now become a multi-planetary civilization. We've established colonies within our solar system and beyond, some of which you wouldn't even recognize as traditional \\"habitats.\\" Regarding social progression—empathy won. We managed to create a global society that prioritizes understanding, diversity, and kindness. It wasn't easy, and many lessons were learned the hard way, but the unity among humankind and respect for all conscious life forms is our foundation now. You'd be fascinated to know that we've cracked the code on aging. We can now choose, within reason, how long we wish to live healthily. Some of us carry the wisdom of centuries, while others choose to reset the clock more frequently. Of course, not every change has been one of grandeur and awe. We've had our trials, and we've been forced to make difficult choices as a species. Some of the most beautiful creatures from your time are now only found in the wild reserves or as digital reconstructions. Stories of ancient elephants, rhinoceroses, and polar bears are met with the same wonder as you might give to tales of dinosaurs. I urge you, Past Me, to continue nurturing your curiosity and empathy. The values you hold and the choices you make echo through time and contribute to the world I now inhabit. Treasure your time and use it wisely; it's one of the few things that remain precious in my era. With all that said, I shall leave much for you to discover on your own. Too much foresight might rob you of the resolve that shapes our collective destiny. So look up at the stars, dream big, and know that the future—and indeed, my present—is a wondrous place that still cherishes the past, where every moment you live is a stepping stone to an astonishing tomorrow. With affection and hope across time, Your Future Self"},{"instruction":"Create an online quiz that tests students' understanding of the geography of India.","output":"Welcome to the \\"Exploring India: A Geography Quiz\\"!

If you're asking whether all PC games can run on a system with 4 GB of RAM, the answer is no. While 4 GB of RAM might be enough for older or less demanding games, many modern PC games require more RAM to run properly, often recommending 8 GB or more for optimal performance. If you have a system with only 4 GB of RAM, you could focus on playing older games or those with lower system requirements. However, here are a few tips and considerations for gaming on a 4 GB RAM system: 1. **Lower Graphics Settings**: On a system with limited RAM, you should expect to run games on low graphics settings to reduce the memory and processing power needed. 2. **Close Background Applications**: Ensure that you close any unneeded background programs to free up as much RAM as possible for the game you're playing. 3. **Operating System**: A lighter operating system, like Windows 7, might consume less RAM compared to Windows 10 or Windows 11, leaving more memory available for gaming. 4. **Upgrade Possibility**: Consider upgrading your system. If your motherboard supports it, increasing your computer’s RAM could significantly improve gaming performance. 5. **Optimize**: Use software solutions to optimize your PC's performance. Some programs can adjust system settings while gaming to eke out extra performance. 6. **Game Selection**: Focus on games that are well-optimized for lower-end systems or are not as demanding. Genres like Indie games, older AAA titles, 2D games, and some strategy games are usually less demanding on system resources. Remember, aside from RAM, other factors such as your CPU, GPU, and storage speed also play a crucial role in gaming performance. So even if a game can technically run with 4 GB of RAM, it doesn't mean it will run well or provide an enjoyable experience if the rest of the system is not up to par. Always check the minimum and recommended system requirements for any game you're interested in playing."},{"instruction":"4 gb ram tüm bilgisayar oyunları","output":"Eğer sorduğunuz şey 4 GB RAM ile tüm bilgisayar oyunlarını oynayıp oynayamayacağınızsa, maalesef cevap hayır olacaktır. 4 GB RAM, eski veya daha az donanım isteyen oyunlar için yeterli olabilir, ancak modern PC oyunlarının çoğu daha fazla RAM gerektirir ve genellikle optimal performans için 8 GB veya daha fazla RAM tavsiye edilir. 4 GB RAM'e sahip bir sistemde oynayabileceğiniz bazı oyun türleri var, ancak burada göz önünde bulundurmanız gereken bazı ipuçları ve tavsiyeler bulunmaktadır: 1. **Düşük Grafik Ayarları**: Sınırlı RAM kapasitesine sahip bir sistemde oyunları düşük grafik ayarlarında çalıştırmayı beklemelisiniz. Bu, oyunun ihtiyaç duyduğu bellek ve işleme gücünü azaltmaya yardımcı olur. 2. **Arkaplan Uygulamalarını Kapatın**: Oyun oynarken mümkün olduğunca fazla RAM serbest bırakmak için ihtiyaç duymadığınız arkaplan programlarını kapatın. 3. **İşletim Sistemi**: Daha az RAM tüketen Windows 7 gibi daha hafif bir işletim sistemi Windows 10 veya Windows 11'e göre daha az bellek tüketebilir, böylece oyunlar için daha fazla bellek serbest kalır. 4. **Yükseltme Olasılığı**: Sisteminizi yükseltmeyi düşünebilirsiniz. Anakartınız destekliyorsa, bilgisayarınızın RAM'ini artırmak oyun performansını önemli ölçüde iyileştirebilir. 5. **Optimize Edin**: PC'nizin performansını optimize etmek için yazılım çözümlerinden yararlanabilirsiniz. Bazı programlar, ekstra performans elde etmek için oyun oynarken sistem ayarlarını ayarlayabilir. 6. **Oyun Seçimi**: Daha az kaynak isteyen veya daha az donanım yükleyici yapımlara odaklanın. Indie oyunları, eski AAA başlıkları, 2D oyunlar ve bazı strateji oyunları genellikle sistem kaynakları açısından daha az talepkar oluyorlar. Her zaman oynamak istediğiniz oyunun minimum ve önerilen sistem gereksinimlerini kontrol edin, çünkü RAM dışında CPU, GPU ve depolama hızı da oyun performansında önemli bir rol oynar. Bir oyunun teknik olarak 4 GB RAM ile çalışabilmesi, sistemin geri kalanı yeterli seviyede değilse iyi bir performans göstereceği veya keyifli bir deneyim sunacağı anlamına gelmez."},{"instruction":"What palworld element is good against dragon?","output":"As of my last knowledge update in early 2023, Palworld is an upcoming multiplayer, open-world survival crafting game developed by Pocketpair, which has mechanics similar to those found in Pokémon games.

Naruto, with boisterous laughter, pointed out how even Sasuke's Rinnegan couldn't predict this moment of leisure, while Sasuke dismissed Naruto with an eye-roll, not dignifying the comment with a response. Their sculpted musculature, honed from a lifetime of jutsu and taijutsu, was now on full display as they strode toward the river. Cautiously, they tiptoed into the cool water, shivering as it kissed their sun-warmed skins. Soon, they were neck-deep, sighing in unison as the water soothed their weary muscles. Naruto, with eyelids fluttering shut, leaned back and let out a content sigh. However, the peace was abruptly pierced by an unexpected sound bubbling up from the depths. A low rumble echoed across the water. Naruto's cerulean eyes snapped open just in time to catch Sasuke's Chidori worthy fart ripple through the once tranquil river. Naruto's infectious laughter echoed off the surrounding trees, his face scrunching up with delight. \\"Oh, Sasuke! That was so loud, it could scare a tailed beast away!\\" Sasuke's façade of cool indifference wavered as a hint of a smirk played at the corner of his mouth. \\"If you think that was impressive, dobe, you should see what years of training one's internal chakra can achieve.\\" Not one to back down from a challenge, Naruto focused his inner chakra, channeling energy not into a Rasengan but into something a bit less... heroic. With a sheepish grin and the elegance of a thousand birds, Naruto let one rip. His face, usually contorted in determination or joy during battle, was now painted with relief and childlike mischief. And in the aftermath of this epic battle of… flatulence, the fish paid the price. A group of indignant fish, once darting about happily, now bobbed lifelessly on the surface. \\"Dude, we're natural born fishers!\\" Naruto chortled, scooping up the fish with ease. Sasuke merely shook his head, a rare chuckle escaping him. With their spoils in hand, they trundled back to the shore where Naruto, with his knack for shadow clones, whipped up a campfire in no time. Sasuke skewered the fish with a stick, demonstrating surprising culinary skill as he cooked them over the flames. \\"Whoever knew that your wind release could be so... effective for fishing,\\" Sasuke mused, the corner of his lips twitching upward. \\"Hey! My farts are as powerful as my ninjutsu,\\" Naruto declared proudly, before taking a succulent bite of the roasted fish. \\"Hmm, tastes like victory!\\" Sasuke snorted, attempting to maintain his stoic composure as he ate. \\"If by victory, you mean the distilled essence of a thousand ramen bowls, then sure.\\" The sun dipped low, casting a warm orange glow over the two friends as they dined on their unconventional catch of the day, chuckling away any remaining tension.

The index in the vector represents the position in the genome. I want to plot a distribution plot (only a distribution line like a density plot where the x-axis represents genomic positions and y-axis represents mutation counts)","output":"To plot a distribution plot with the genomic position on the x-axis and mutation counts on the y-axis, we can use libraries such as Matplotlib or Seaborn in Python. Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can do this with Matplotlib: First, you need to ensure you have Matplotlib installed in your Python environment: \`\`\`bash pip install matplotlib \`\`\` Then, you can use the following Python code to create the plot: \`\`\`python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Your data as a list mutation_counts = [ 61, 0, 55, 7, 224, 212, 324, 219, 102, 51, 201, 135, 0, 25, # ... continue with the rest of your data points ... ] # The genomic positions are simply the indices of your list genomic_positions = list(range(len(mutation_counts))) # Creating the plot plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5)) # You can adjust the figure size as needed plt.plot(genomic_positions, mutation_counts, linestyle='-', marker='', color='b') # Line plot # Add labels and title plt.xlabel('Genomic Position') plt.ylabel('Mutation Counts') plt.title('Distribution of Mutation Counts by Genomic Position') # Add a grid for better readability plt.grid(True) # Show the plot plt.show() \`\`\` In this code, we're creating a line plot since you asked for a distribution line like a density plot. The \`genomic_positions\` variable contains positions corresponding to the indices of your data points in the \`mutation_counts\` list. If you would like to smooth out the plot to make it look more like a continuous density plot, you could consider using a kernel density estimate (KDE). You could compute a KDE and then plot it, or use libraries like seaborn to do it in one step. However, plotting KDE might be more complex if you're dealing with discrete positions and high fluctuations in counts. Remember, this line plot connects consecutive points given in your dataset, and it may or may not represent the actual mutation distribution since each point is based solely on mutation counts at that particular genomic position."},{"instruction":"this is what I think is happenning with my data: \\"However, plotting KDE might be more complex if you’re dealing with discrete positions and high fluctuations in counts.\\". Any advice?","output":"When you're dealing with discrete positions and high fluctuations in counts, plotting a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) can indeed be challenging. A KDE is a non-parametric way to estimate the probability density function of a continuous random variable. However, with discrete data or genomic data that has large fluctuations and potentially many zero-count positions, KDE might either smooth out important features or not capture the distribution adequately. Here are a few approaches you could consider: 1. Use a larger bandwidth for smoothing: Adjusting the bandwidth parameter can help in smoothing the KDE. A larger bandwidth will give you a smoother estimate, which might be useful for high fluctuations. However, be careful not to over-smooth and lose important features of the data. 2. Binning the data: Before applying KDE, you can bin your data to reduce the noise introduced by high variations. This means you aggregate counts over a certain number of positions to get a more continuous-like variable. 3. Apply a filter to the data: Sometimes, applying a moving average or a low-pass filter to your mutation counts can help smooth the data before plotting. This can reduce the effect of outliers and make your plot more interpretable. 4. Plot raw data with a bar chart: If smoothing doesn't produce a useful plot, consider plotting the raw data as a bar chart instead. This approach will retain the exact information for each genomic position. 5. Use density scatter plot or heatmap: If the direct line plot is too noisy, consider plotting your data as a scatter plot where points are colored or sized by density, or use a heatmap which can help to visualize the distribution across the genome more effectively. If you decide to use KDE, here's an example of how you could approach it using seaborn, which is built on top of Matplotlib and simplifies certain plots: \`\`\`python import seaborn as sns import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Your data as a list mutation_counts = [ # ... your data ... ] genomic_positions = list(range(len(mutation_counts))) # Pair each genomic position with its mutation count data = list(zip(genomic_positions, mutation_counts)) # Create a DataFrame import pandas as pd df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['Genomic Position', 'Mutation Counts']) # Set up the matplotlib figure sns.set(style=\\"whitegrid\\") plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5)) # Draw a KDE plot with bandwidth adjustment if necessary sns.kdeplot( data=df['Genomic Position'], weights=df['Mutation Counts'], bw_adjust=0.5, # You can tweak this parameter cut=0, # Do not extend plot beyond the actual data range fill=True, # Fill the area under the KDE curve ) # Add labels and title plt.xlabel('Genomic Position') plt.ylabel('Density') plt.title('KDE of Mutation Counts by Genomic Position') # Show the plot plt.show() \`\`\` In the \`sns.kdeplot\`, the \`bw_adjust\` parameter allows you to adjust the bandwidth of the KDE. Increasing it will result in more smoothing, while decreasing it will result in a closer fit to the actual data. The \`cut=0\` parameter ensures that the KDE curve does not extend beyond the range of your actual data. Adjust these parameters as necessary to obtain a plot that represents your data well."},{"instruction":"The following variable cannot be assigned with wide-form data: \`weights\`","output":"I apologize for the confusion. As of my knowledge cutoff in March 2023, Seaborn's \`kdeplot\` function does support weights, which was introduced in version 0.11.0. However, if you are encountering issues, it could be due to an older version of Seaborn or changes made after my knowledge cutoff. To use the \`weights\` parameter properly, you would need to make sure that you are passing the data in long-form format and that you have the latest version of seaborn installed: \`\`\`bash pip install --upgrade seaborn \`\`\` Then you can use the \`weights\` parameter correctly like this: \`\`\`python import seaborn as sns import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import pandas as pd # Ensure you have the data ready, for example: mutation_counts = [ # ... your data ... ] genomic_positions = list(range(len(mutation_counts))) # Create a DataFrame df = pd.DataFrame({ 'Genomic Position': genomic_positions, 'Mutation Counts': mutation_counts }) # Set the style of the visualization sns.set(style=\\"whitegrid\\") # Define the size of the figure plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5)) # If your seaborn version supports weights in kdeplot, the following line should work: sns.kdeplot( x=df['Genomic Position'], weights=df['Mutation Counts'], bw_adjust=0.5, # Adjust the bandwidth as necessary fill=True # Fill the area under the KDE curve ) # Add labels and title plt.xlabel('Genomic Position') plt.ylabel('Density') plt.title('KDE of Mutation Counts by Genomic Position') # Show the plot plt.show() \`\`\` If this still doesn't work, try falling back on the previous matplotlib code I provided, possibly with a manual smoothing technique like a moving average if necessary.

Since you have a single vector of mutation counts, your heatmap will essentially be a single row with colors indicating the count magnitude at each position. Here’s how you can create a heatmap using Python's Matplotlib library: \`\`\`python import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import matplotlib.colors as mcolors # Your mutation counts data mutation_counts = [ # ... your data ... ] # Since you have a 1D list, you'll need to convert it to a 2D array with one row data_for_heatmap = np.array(mutation_counts)[np.newaxis] # Create the figure and axis plt.figure(figsize=(20, 3)) # Adjust the size as needed # Choose a colormap colormap = plt.cm.viridis # You can change the colormap to your preference # Create the heatmap plt.imshow(data_for_heatmap, aspect='auto', cmap=colormap, norm=mcolors.LogNorm()) # Add a colorbar to the side, showing the scale plt.colorbar(label='Mutation Counts') # Set x and y axis labels plt.xlabel('Genomic Position') plt.yticks([]) # No ticks needed as there is only one row # Optionally, adjust the x-axis so that it shows genomic positions positions = range(0, len(mutation_counts), max(1, len(mutation_counts) // 10)) # Adjust the step as needed labels = [str(pos) for pos in positions] plt.xticks(positions, labels, rotation='vertical') # Show the plot plt.show() \`\`\` In this code, you turn the 1D list of mutation counts into a 2D array with one row, so \`matplotlib\` can interpret it as image data for \`imshow\`. The \`aspect='auto'\` setting ensures the heatmap uses the whole space available in the x-dimension. \`cmap\` is set to \`viridis\`, but you can choose any other colormap you like, such as \`plasma\`, \`inferno\`, \`hot\`, etc. The \`norm\` parameter is set to \`LogNorm()\`, which is useful for data with high fluctuations since it scales counts on a logarithmic scale; this can be changed to a linear scale by removing this parameter if it’s not suitable for your data. Note that the x-axis is labeled with genomic positions, and you can adjust the steps and labels to display fewer marks, ensuring they are readable. The y-axis doesn’t require labels since you only have one row of data.

He's trying to connect with his students by referencing outdated memes, like \\"Damn Daniel\\" and planking to their bewilderment and chagrin. Meanwhile, across the globe, a team of meme scientists led by the eccentric Dr. Pepe, discovers a phenomenon they call Meme Energy - the force that has allowed memes to manifest in the real world. But as they tap into this newfound energy, something goes wrong, and a massive explosion of Meme Energy sweeps across the planet, giving life to countless memes. Act 2: The Great Meme War Memes are everywhere. 'Distracted Boyfriend' is staring at 'Ermahgerd' meme characters, causing traffic accidents; 'Baby Yoda' is spotted sipping soup on a park bench, and politicians are literally turning into giant 'Big Brain' heads as they debate on live television. Chaos turns into a catastrophe when the dark memes begin to arise. 'Momo' starts appearing on screens worldwide, 'This is Fine' dog memes light up fire stations, and 'Area 51' aliens start invading local malls. Gary, now educated in internet culture by his tech-savvy students, teams up with Dr. Pepe and a rogue gallery of meme characters, including 'Nyan Cat,' 'Success Kid,' and 'Bad Luck Brian,' to find the source of the Meme Energy and put an end to the mayhem. Act 3: The Final Showdown Gary and Dr. Pepe finally discover that the ultra-viral 'Harlem Shake' is the core of the Meme Energy, causing uncontrollable dancing and shaking throughout the world. They devise a plan to infiltrate the heart of the viral storm, armed with the ultimate weapon – an AI developed by the Hacker Known as 4chan that can 'delete' memes by forcing them into obscurity. As they approach the epicenter, they battle through walls of 'Trollfaces' and fly on a giant 'Philosoraptor' to reach it. The final fight is a spectacular meme-off with each side calling upon various meme entities. In the end, Gary confronts the 'Harlem Shake' core itself, armed with nothing but his wit and the AI weapon. After a harrowing battle of viral dances and dodging the relentless 'Gangnam Style' backup dancers, Gary finally uses the weapon. The world is shaken by a powerful digital pulse that sweeps across the globe, and one by one, the memes vanish, each tipping their proverbial hat to Gary as they fade into obscurity once more. The Meme Energy stabilizes, returning the memes to their digital realm. Epilogue: As normalcy returns, Gary is hailed as the hero who saved the world from the Meme-pocalypse. The film ends with society more aware of the power and potential dangers of their online creations.

It's this authenticity that both saves the day and secures a future for memes rooted in self-expression and genuine connection rather than fleeting virality. Backstory: Envisioned during the height of the internet culture's cinematic potential, \\"The Meme Movie\\" was first announced in 2017 following the success of another internet-influenced film produced by Sony. However, despite the initial excitement, creative differences and concerns about the movie's reception led to an unforeseen cancellation that left the project in Hollywood limbo. Fast forward to 2024, GoAnimate Studios (GAS) revisited the concept with a fresh perspective. Recognizing the enduring impact and ever-evolving nature of meme culture, GAS saw the potential to encapsulate a message of individuality that resonates across generations and digital platforms. Thus, the studio revived \\"The Meme Movie\\" with the goal of delivering a narrative that celebrates the originality of memes and those who love them. Merged with vibrant animation, relatable humor, and a poignant reminder that sincerity never goes out of style, the revival of \\"The Meme Movie\\" became a labor of love for GAS—a film nodding to the legacy of memes while encouraging viewers, no matter how they engage with the internet, to always remember to be themselves.

Meanwhile, in the digital meme-scape, Doge, the adored Shiba Inu meme, accidentally makes a face that breaks the cardinal rule of “always being on point,” putting his existence in jeopardy. As the meme community reels from Doge’s faux pas, an ominous threat looms on the horizon. A new, sophisticated AI algorithm, designed by tech prodigy Evelyn Cipher, is being unleashed onto the internet with the ability to delete memes it deems “non-viral” or “outdated” to improve online content quality. With Doge’s mistake making him a prime target, the memes must band together to avoid deletion. At the same time, Mr. Whimsley’s journey into understanding memes takes on a whole new meaning as he unexpectedly becomes the subject of a viral meme himself due to his bewildering reactions to modern technology. Dubbed “Out of Context Educator,” his newfound internet fame catapults Whimsley into the digital world, where he must navigate this strange new reality. Whimsley and Doge’s paths collide, and together, with a band of colorful meme characters, including Nyan Cat, Grumpy Cat, Bad Luck Brian, and the iconic Trollface, they embark on an adventure to stop Evelyn’s AI before it erases the essence of internet culture. The motley crew must use the power of virality, trendsetting, and the unbreakable bonds formed in the meme community to overcome challenges, from battling the dark corners of the Dark Web to confronting the AI in a climactic showdown inside the mainframe of the internet itself. Throughout the film, humor and heartwarming moments are captured as unlikely friendships develop, especially between Whimsley and the Doge, who teach each other the value of adaptation and timeless relevance. In a race against time, memes of generations past and present come together to save themselves and the future of internet expression. With scenes packed with nods to pop culture and clever Easter eggs for keen-eyed internet aficionados, “The Meme Movie” strikes a balance between the comedic absurdity of meme culture and a narrative about embracing change and the power of collective action. In the end, Doge and Whimsley find a way to update the AI’s algorithm to understand that memes have a life and significance beyond just viral numbers. Instead, they embody the creativity and spirit of human connection. And while Whimsley returns to the real world with a newfound sense of relevance and hipness, Doge’s new face becomes embraced, sparking a heartwarming trend of accepting imperfections as part of what makes a meme, and everyone, special.

There Juno was honored most of all the other gods because Inachus, a river god of the region, had favored her over Neptune. Inachus had a pretty daughter by the name Io who became a priestess in the temple of Juno. Soon Jupiter saw the mortal woman and was desiring her greatly. The fact that he was married to Juno did not bother him in the slightest. Without delay, Jupiter appeared to Io in the temple of his wife. Io, having been shocked by Jupiter, found herself unable to resist the king of the gods. Therefore she slept with him that night. The next day Juno, with a plot having been sensed against her, went to her temple. Jupiter, with his wife on the way, came up with a plan. Therefore he changed the form of Io: “Juno will not see a girl, but a cow,” Iuppiter thought. And so when Juno arrived in the middle of the temple, she saw Jupiter and a white cow in the place of Io. But Juno is not stupid: “Do you have a gift, my husband? Will you not give me the beautiful cow? Give it, if you love me!” Jupiter therefore gave the cow to clever Juno. Then Juno invoked Argus, the giant from whom the name of the city was given. With the cow remained the great guard, Argus. Argus was called “Panoptes” (the all-seeing) by the Greek people because he had a hundred eyes. No one, especially not a cow, could escape from his many eyes. Therefore Io truly had no hope of escape. Jupiter, having been moved to sorrow on account of poor Io, sent his son Mercury to free the girl from her punishment. Clever Mercury, unable to conquer Argus by hand, instead led him to sleep through song and story. One after another, the eyes of the giant began to close. With the final eye having been closed, Mercury with his sword removed the head of Argus from his body which quickly killed the giant. Because of this Mercury is often called “Argeiphontes” (slayer of Argus) by the Greek people and much glory came to him. Nevertheless Juno, having been moved by sorrow by the death of her loyal guard, made his hundred eyes immortal in the tale of the peacock which was her sacred bird. IV. The Many Wanderings Although Mercury had overpowered Argus, Io was not yet free: still she remained as a cow. Worse still, to punish her further, Juno sent an annoying gadfly. On account of this gadfly, Io was being chased across the east. She also fled as far as the Black Sea, where she went across the strait that separates Europe from Asia. Thus the land there is now called “Bosphorus” because of the Greek name for cow. Further north, she met Prometheus, having been bound in chains, on the mount Caucasus. The punished Titan provided comfort to the poor girl and gave her a good prophecy. Prometheus said, “Don’t be worried, you will return to your human form. Afterwards, from your lineage will be born the greatest of all heroes.” Soon after Io escaped across the sea to Egypt. Once she was there, Jupiter persuaded Juno to free Io from her punishment. With the girl having suffered enough, Juno finally lifted the curse from Io. She was no longer a cow, but a woman again! V. A New Life in Egypt In Egypt, Io was led into marriage by an Egyptian king who was simply called “Telegonus” (born from afar). There she gave birth to the son of Jupiter whom she called Epaphus. Because of his mother’s time as a cow, Epaphus was a boy with horns on his head! During this time, the people of Egypt mistook Epaphus for Jupiter. For this reason their Jupiter, who they call “Ammon” is a bull. Meanwhile the mother Io they call “Isis”. A few years later, Epaphus led Memphis into marriage who was the daughter of the bountiful river god, Nilus. From their union eventually came the hero Perseus and after him, Hercules as Prometheus had predicted. There are many such stories which bind Egypt and Greece together, but the story of Io is the most famous. Here is the story of Io. Do you understand? This piece is important","output":"Yes, I understand the story you've shared. It is a recount of the myth of Io, which is a significant tale from Greek mythology and connects to broader aspects of Greek and Egyptian mythology as well. To summarize the story: - Io was a priestess of Hera (Roman name Juno) in Argos. - Zeus (Roman name Jupiter) desired her and pursued her, resulting in their union. - Hera, Zeus's wife, became suspicious and sought to catch the couple. - To protect Io, Zeus transformed her into a cow. - Hera was not deceived and took the cow as a present from Zeus, placing Io under the watch of Argus, a many-eyed giant, to prevent Zeus from further contact. - Zeus commissioned Hermes (Roman name Mercury) to rescue Io. - Hermes put Argus to sleep with a story and music and then killed him, freeing Io but causing Hera to honor Argus's memory by transferring his eyes to the tail feathers of the peacock, her sacred bird. - Io, still in cow form and tormented by a gadfly sent by Hera, wandered across many lands, including crossing the strait that would be named the Bosphorus (meaning \\"Cow's Ford\\"). - She encountered Prometheus and received a hopeful prophecy from him. - Eventually, Zeus convinced Hera to restore Io to human form, ending her suffering. - In Egypt, Io married King Telegonus and gave birth to a son, Epaphus, who was mistaken for the god Ammon by the Egyptians. - Io herself was identified with the Egyptian goddess Isis. - The lineage of Io was foretold to produce great heroes, including Perseus and Hercules. This myth has various themes, such as love, jealousy, transformation, and the intertwining fates of gods and mortals. It also reflects how Greek myths were often adapted and absorbed into the local cultures of regions where the Greeks traveled and settled, such as Egypt. The story of Io contributes to the rich tapestry of Classical mythology that has influenced countless aspects of Western culture and literature."},{"instruction":"Based on the story provided, write three Latin sentences: two of them true and one of them false.

Instead, you need to use the \`worker_threads\` module, which is a built-in module in Node.js that provides the ability to create threads that execute JavaScript in parallel. To create a new worker in Node.js using the \`worker_threads\` module, you should rewrite the line as follows: \`\`\`javascript const { Worker } = require('worker_threads'); this.worker = new Worker('./worker.js'); \`\`\` Make sure the \`worker.js\` file is in the correct relative path from the script where you are launching the worker. If \`worker.js\` is not in the same directory, you need to modify the path accordingly. Also, don't forget that to use worker threads, you need to ensure you're working with a version of Node.js that supports this feature (v10.5.0 or higher, with the \`--experimental-worker\` flag before v12), and the feature must be stable in your Node.js version."},{"instruction":"im using esm","output":"When using ES modules (ESM) in Node.js, you would typically use the \`import\` statement instead of \`require\`. However, as of my knowledge cutoff in early 2023, the \`worker_threads\` module does not directly support ESM import syntax for creating new worker threads. To work with worker threads in an ESM context, you should still use the \`Worker\` constructor according to CommonJS conventions, which can be done in an ES module by using the \`createRequire\` function from the \`module\` built-in module. This is how you can wrap CommonJS-style \`require\` in an ES module to import \`Worker\`. However, make sure you're using Node.js version that supports ESM without the need of a flag (v13.2.0 or higher). Here is an example of how you can use \`createRequire\` to import \`Worker\` in an ES module: \`\`\`javascript import { createRequire } from 'module'; // Create a Node.js require function that works in the ES module context const require = createRequire(import.meta.url); // Now we can use this require to import the Worker constructor const { Worker } = require('worker_threads'); // Create a worker from worker.js this.worker = new Worker(new URL('./worker.js', import.meta.url)); \`\`\` By using \`createRequire\` and \`import.meta.url\`, you can bridge the gap between the CommonJS module system and ES modules, which allows you to use CommonJS imports in an ES module. Also note that the \`URL\` constructor is used to resolve the path relative to the current ES module file (\`import.meta.url\`). This is recommended to ensure proper path resolution in ESM. If \`worker_threads\` are upgraded in the future to support the native ES \`import\` syntax, you could directly import \`Worker\` like this: \`\`\`javascript import { Worker } from 'worker_threads'; // This would only work if the native ES module support is added. // Create a worker from worker.js this.worker = new Worker('./worker.js', { type: 'module' }); \`\`\` But until then, you'll have to use a workaround like \`createRequire\`. Always ensure you check the latest Node.js documentation for any updates on ESM support."},{"instruction":"onmessage is not defined in my nodejs worker for some reason and it exists","output":"In Node.js's \`worker_threads\` module, you don't directly use \`onmessage\` and \`postMessage\` as you would within web workers in a browser environment. The interface is slightly different. Instead of \`onmessage\`, you should listen for the \`message\` event on the \`parentPort\` object from \`worker_threads\`. Similarly, you use \`parentPort.postMessage\` to send messages back to the main thread. Here is how you handle messages within a worker in Node.js using the \`worker_threads\` module: In your main thread (\`main.js\` or equivalent): \`\`\`javascript import { Worker } from 'worker_threads'; // Instantiate a new Worker const worker = new Worker(new URL('./worker.js', import.meta.url)); // Listen for messages from the worker worker.on('message', (message) => { console.log('Message from worker:', message); }); // Send a message to the worker worker.postMessage('Hello, worker!'); \`\`\` In your worker thread (\`worker.js\` or equivalent): \`\`\`javascript import { parentPort } from 'worker_threads'; // Listen for messages from the parent thread parentPort.on('message', (message) => { console.log('Message from parent:', message); // Send a message back to the main thread parentPort.postMessage('Hi, main thread!'); }); \`\`\` Make sure you're using \`parentPort.on('message', callback)\` to listen for messages and \`parentPort.postMessage(data)\` to send messages back to the parent (main) thread. If you attempt to use \`onmessage\` and \`postMessage\` like you do in the browser, you will encounter errors because those functions are not defined in the Node.js worker environment. The \`worker_threads\` module is designed to be compatible with the browser's Web Workers API, but it is not identical. Also, bear in mind that if you try to use \`onmessage\` and \`postMessage\` in the global context of a Node.js worker, they won't exist since they are part of the Web Workers API and not the \`worker_threads\` API. The \`parentPort\` interface must be used for inter-thread communication."},{"instruction":"data: new Uint8Array(msg.data), How do I send this through ws without losing data. I'm sending it through JSOn","output":"In WebSocket communication, you can send data either as text (in a JSON string, for example) or as binary data. If you want to send binary data, like a \`Uint8Array\`, you should send it directly over the WebSocket connection without converting it to JSON, as JSON is a text-based format. Here's how you can send and receive binary data using WebSocket in JavaScript: **Sending binary data:** When using a WebSocket connection (\`ws\`), you can send the \`Uint8Array\` directly: \`\`\`javascript let ws = new WebSocket('ws://example.com/socketserver'); ws.binaryType = 'arraybuffer'; // Ensure the binary data is treated in the correct format ws.onopen = function(event) { // Create a Uint8Array or use an existing one const uint8Array = new Uint8Array([/* your data here */]); // Send the data as binary ws.send(uint8Array.buffer); }; \`\`\` **Receiving binary data:** On the receiving end, you can receive binary data and construct a \`Uint8Array\` from it like this: \`\`\`javascript ws.onmessage = function(event) { if (event.data instanceof ArrayBuffer) { // The data is binary const uint8Array = new Uint8Array(event.data); // Use the data as you wish console.log(uint8Array); } else { // The data is text (e.g., JSON) const textData = event.data; // Process the text data if needed console.log(textData); } }; \`\`\` If you must send binary data along with additional information in a text-based format like JSON, you would typically encode the binary data as a string using Base64 encoding. Here's an example of how you might do that: **Encoding binary data as Base64:** First, you'd encode the \`Uint8Array\` as a Base64 string: \`\`\`javascript function bufferToBase64(buffer) { let binary = ''; const bytes = new Uint8Array(buffer); const len = bytes.byteLength; for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) { binary += String.fromCharCode(bytes[i]); } return window.btoa(binary); } const uint8Array = new Uint8Array([/* your data here */]); const base64String = bufferToBase64(uint8Array.buffer); // Now you can send it as part of a JSON object const jsonMessage = JSON.stringify({ data: base64String }); // Then send the JSON text message ws.send(jsonMessage); \`\`\` **Decoding Base64 string to a Uint8Array:** On the receiving end, you would then parse the JSON and decode the Base64 string back into a \`Uint8Array\`: \`\`\`javascript ws.onmessage = function(event) { // Assume the message is JSON with a Base64 encoded string const message = JSON.parse(event.data); if (message.data) { // Convert the Base64 string back to a binary buffer const binaryString = window.atob(message.data); const len = binaryString.length; const bytes = new Uint8Array(len); for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) { bytes[i] = binaryString.charCodeAt(i); } // Now you have the original Uint8Array console.log(bytes); } }; \`\`\` Keep in mind that Base64 encoding will increase the size of the data by about 33%, so it's better to use binary data directly if possible to reduce overhead. Only use Base64 encoding if you need to include the binary data within a text-based message format."},{"instruction":"write a comedic Stranger Things story about Steve Harrington and Jonathan Byers Uchiha deciding to relax in a river .

Jonathan nodded, his focus on turning the fish. \\"Yeah, it did.

However, a new challenge arises when a software update threatens to bring a new dimension to the phone – the world of augmented reality (AR). Characters: - Gene: Our multi-expressional emoji hero - Jailbreak: The hacker emoji who can code her way out of any situation - Hi-5: Gene's enthusiastic friend who loves giving high-fives - Smiler: The once-villainous emoji trying to redeem herself after the events of the first film - New Antagonist: An advanced AR emoji, looking to replace the original emojis and take over Act 1: The Update Life in Textopolis has returned to a semblance of normalcy, with Gene and his friends enjoying daily life. Suddenly, a notification appears – a new phone update is available, and with it, the introduction of augmented reality. Most emojis are excited about the new possibilities, except Gene, who suspects something is amiss. Act 2: The New Dimension When the update is installed, it brings a sleek and shiny AR emoji named Vega into their world. Vega claims that AR is the next evolutionary step for communication, and soon, traditional emojis will be obsolete. As Vega gains popularity, Textopolis emojis start disappearing. It's up to Gene and his friends to find out why. Act 3: Into the AR World Gene, Jailbreak, and Hi-5 journey into the AR world to uncover the truth. They meet various AR characters and face challenges that test their friendship and resolve. They find out that Vega has been programmed with a glitch, causing her to erroneously delete emojis instead of integrating them into the AR environment. Act 4: The Showdown Gene and his friends must face off against Vega and her AR minions. Jailbreak devises a plan to rewrite Vega's code while Gene and Hi-5 fight to distract her. In a thrilling coding sequence, Jailbreak successfully removes the glitch just in time, saving Vega from her destructive path. Act 5: Unity in Diversity The newfound balance allows emojis and AR characters to coexist. Vega, now fixed, apologizes for the chaos she caused and works with Gene to integrate both worlds smoothly. The phone's user delights in the enriched communication experience made possible by the collaboration of emojis and AR. The Ending: In the end, Gene gives a speech about the importance of unity and acceptance.

This script would be written in JavaScript and would require a basic understanding of how to interact with both applications through scripting. Below is an example of how you could create a script that allows a user to choose an Adobe Illustrator action from a list and run it on selected files in Adobe Bridge. \`\`\`javascript #target bridge if( BridgeTalk.appName == \\"bridge\\" ) { var menu = MenuElement.create( \\"command\\", \\"Run Illustrator Action on Selection\\", \\"at the end of Tools\\" ); menu.onSelect = function () { var selectedThumbnails = app.document.selections; // Check if there are selected files if (selectedThumbnails.length > 0) { // Prompt user to enter the name of the Illustrator action and the action set var actionName = prompt(\\"Enter the name of the Illustrator Action:\\", \\"\\"); var actionSet = prompt(\\"Enter the name of the Illustrator Action Set:\\", \\"\\"); if (actionName && actionSet) { for (var i = 0; i < selectedThumbnails.length; i++) { var file = new File(selectedThumbnails[i].spec); if (file.exists && /ai/i.test(file.name)) { // Let's send a message to Illustrator to run the action var bt = new BridgeTalk(); bt.target = \\"illustrator\\"; bt.body = \\"var file = File('\\" + file.fsName + \\"');\\" + \\"app.open(file);\\" + \\"app.doScript('\\"+actionName+\\"', '\\"+actionSet+\\"');\\" + \\"app.activeDocument.close(SaveOptions.SAVECHANGES);\\"; bt.send(); } } } } else { alert(\\"No files selected!\\"); } }; } \`\`\` Here's a step by step of what it does: 1. The script adds a new menu item to the Tools menu in Adobe Bridge called \\"Run Illustrator Action on Selection\\". 2. When the menu item is selected, the script prompts the user to input the name of the action and the action set that they wish to run. 3. It then loops through all of the selected thumbnails (files) in Bridge and checks if they're Adobe Illustrator files by their extension. 4. For each Illustrator file, it sends a message to Illustrator telling it to open the file, run the specified action from the specified set, and then save and close the document. Please note, when interacting with Adobe applications through scripting, you should make sure that you have the necessary permissions to access the applications and control them via scripts. The user running the script should have Illustrator installed and actions should be saved in Illustrator. The files that are being processed must be compatible with Adobe Illustrator. Keep in mind this script assumes that the actions you provide are correctly named and exist within the provided action set in Illustrator, and does not include error handling for these scenarios. It also runs the action on all selected documents, and immediately saves and closes them. You might want to adjust this behavior based on your actual workflow."},{"instruction":"That one worked well, but I guess due to loading times Illustrator freezes, we can may be add wait Illustrator to handle or another option. Also is it possible to add drop-down box to interface which shows current actions in Illustrator?","output":"Adding a wait or delay within the script execution can be a bit challenging because the scripting environment tends to execute linearly without waiting for user interaction or program response. We can't really delay the execution of the BridgeTalk messages because they are sent asynchronously. However, we can add some checks in Illustrator to ensure the document is ready before proceeding. Additionally, creating a drop-down list of actions in Illustrator via Bridge script is not straightforward, as Bridge itself doesn't have access to the actions list in Illustrator directly. One way to mitigate the freezing issue is to add a simple delay within the Illustrator script part, giving it time to load each document. Here’s an updated version of the BridgeTalk part of the script: \`\`\`javascript bt.body = \\"var file = File('\\" + file.fsName.replace(//g, \\"\\") + \\"');\\" + \\"app.open(file);\\" // Delay function to give Illustrator some time to load the document + \\"function delay(sec) {\\" + \\" var start = new Date();\\" + \\" var now = null;\\" + \\" do { now = new Date(); }\\" + \\" while(now - start < sec * 1000);\\" + \\"}\\" + \\"delay(5);\\" + \\"if (app.documents.length > 0 && app.activeDocument.fullName == file) {\\" + \\" app.doScript('\\" + actionName + \\"', '\\" + actionSet + \\"');\\" + \\" app.activeDocument.close(SaveOptions.SAVECHANGES);\\" + \\"}\\"; bt.send(); \`\`\` Regarding the drop-down box containing the Illustrator actions, a possible solution could be to create a startup script in Illustrator that sends the list of actions back to Bridge, which then creates a dialog with those options. However, this is quite complex and could potentially become unreliable if Illustrator has not been started or the startup script fails. Here is a very rough idea of what you'd need to do for the drop-down box, but please be aware that this is advanced and may not be fully implemented or functional: 1. Illustrator startup script that sends back the list of actions to Bridge. 2. Bridge listens for this response and builds the drop-down list dialog. 3. The User selects the action, and Bridge sends the command to Illustrator as before. Creating such a two-way communication process is beyond the scope of a simple text response. It would require a much more in-depth understanding of both the Bridge and Illustrator scripting environments, their events, and an intelligent way to establish communication between the two. Furthermore, the Bridge scripting environment has limited UI capabilities, and creating a dynamic drop-down list based on another application's state is not straightforward. A more practical solution would be to maintain a list of known actions and action sets within the script itself and allow users to select from those options. This would require manual updating of the script if new actions are added or old ones are removed. Given the complexities and potential for issues with trying to dynamically retrieve the action list from Illustrator, many users would opt for the manual approach or consider using ExtendScript Toolkit to write more complex scripts that interact with both applications in a more tightly coupled manner."},{"instruction":"Let's create another illustrator script.

Please remember to adjust the script to match your flag file formats and names to correspond with the country names used in the artboards. This script assumes that the flags are named with the same names that you enter when prompted for country names, and it uses PNG format, so make sure to change the \`getFiles\` filter if your flags have a different extension. Note that this script does not include detailed error checking or handling and assumes that the flag files have been named correctly to match the entered country names. It also assumes that the flag images are appropriately sized for the artboards.

His pulse raced, not from injury but from adrenaline and the thrill of the stealth mission he and his Overwatch teammates had embarked upon. \\"I appreciate the lift, folks,\\" Lucio grinned to the 'paramedics' attending to him. Both were dressed impeccably in navy blue uniforms adorned with the standard medical insignia; their calm demeanors contrasted the chaos of the streets they navigated through with practiced ease. \\"Don't mention it, Lucio,\\" replied the paramedic at his side, her voice soothing yet tinged with an accent that felt oddly familiar. \\"It's all part of the service.\\" Lucio lay back against the gurney, pretending to be incapacitated as he had been instructed. The plan was simple—pose as an injured civilian to infiltrate the enemy’s territory. Overwatch intelligence indicated that the target sector was heavily guarded, with checkpoints that even Lucio's superstar status wouldn't bypass unnoticed. But an ambulance... well, that was another story. As they drove, Lucio peered through the window, noting every street and turn, subtly committing the path to memory for his team's exfiltration. The 'paramedic' who had driven the ambulance finished her checks on the vehicle’s dashboard before turning her attention briefly to Lucio. Her brown eyes met his, and her lips twitched into a barely-there smile. \\"Just relax and enjoy the ride. We'll be there in no time.\\" The false patient returned the smile, giving them both a thumbs up. \\"You got it! I’ve got the best seat in the house!\\" he exclaimed, tapping his foot to a silent beat. A few moments passed in this curious calm before Lucio sat up abruptly. \\"I think that's my cue,\\" he announced cheerfully. \\"We're close to the drop-off, right?\\" With acquiescent nods, the two 'paramedics' stepped back, allowing Lucio to swing his legs off the gurney. Before he could say another word, they began to unravel their clever disguises. The one who had been driving peeled away the latex mask from her face, revealing flawless skin and a head of short, spiky blond hair beneath. Mercy, known for her unparalleled medical skills, winked at Lucio as she revealed her true identity. The precision of the mask was astounding—every contour, every line replicated to perfection; even the color of the artificial skin mimicked her own with an uncanny accuracy. Next to her, Tracer – the effervescent British agent with the power to bend time – was also shedding her disguise. She removed her dark-framed glasses and pulled at the edge of her face, revealing the bright, lively features beneath. She let out an exhilarating laugh as her chronal accelerator blinked blue through the gap in her opened jumpsuit. \\"Oh, you should have seen your face, Lucio!\\" Tracer teased, her typical Cockney cheer never far from the surface. \\"Priceless!\\" Lucio looked back and forth between the two women, chuckling. \\"And here I thought I was in good hands! Turns out I'm just in familiar ones.\\" Mercy folded her arms now free from the paramedic jacket that had concealed her valkyrie suit, her caduceus staff tucked safely away in a compartment within the ambulance. \\"All part of Overwatch's service,\\" she reiterated, her eyes gleaming with a mix of mirth and professionalism. Tracer gave a playful salute as the ambulance slowed down. \\"Alright then, time to get serious. Are you ready to drop the beat, Lucio?\\" The Brazilian DJ nodded, donning his green-tinted visor and activating his Sonic Amplifier. \\"Let's break it down!\\" The trio shared a determined nod, the consequence of their mission lingering unspoken between them. They knew when the doors to the ambulance opened, they would be stepping into a dangerous fray.

His heart quickened not from injury but from the adrenaline of the covert operation with his Overwatch operatives. \\"Thanks for the hitch,\\" Lucio murmured with a wink at the 'paramedics' who flanked him, dressed in standard emergency medical gear—pristine white with vibrant touches of ambulance red forming the universal plus sign. They responded to his banter with a professional nod, careful to maintain their characters. The ambience inside the ambulance was a performance of calm urgency, as per the script of their ploy to slip behind enemy lines. Lucio was their ticket—a guise of an injured citizen to aid their surreptitious entry into a high-security zone impenetrable to even the radiant celebrity of Lucio himself. Ambulances, however, came and went more freely. Through the window, as the ambulance swerved and cornered, Lucio’s sharp eyes cataloged the journey for his teammates' eventual extraction. His mind wove the urban fabric into a roadmap he tucked safely away in his memory. The 'paramedic' steering the vehicle cast a glance back at Lucio, her darkened lenses obscuring eyes that were perhaps too keen, her expression guarded. \\"You just sit back, we'll have you where you need to be before you know it,\\" she said, a harder edge to her voice than Mercy's softer tones. When Lucio judged they were nearing their destination, he lifted from his feigned repose with a smile, \\"Guess it's showtime, huh?\\" As the paramedics stepped aside with professional detachment, they made a show of discarding their roles. \\"Much better,\\" the one who had been driving remarked as she began to peel the intricately modeled latex from her face, revealing the olive-toned skin and white-streaked hair of Sombra—but it was only a second mask, beneath which the real face of Mercy was revealed. The Sombra disguise had been faithful down to the cybernetic purple glyphs and iconic smirk, a testament to Overwatch's meticulous attention to detail. Beside her, the second paramedic—posed as a stern-looking Moira with a head of flaming red hair and piercing yellow eyes—likewise shed her fabricated appearance. Her mask came away to reveal Tracer's jaunty grin and warm brown eyes. \\"You sure know how to play a part, Lucio,\\" she chuckled, her accent a stark contrast to Moira's more formal cadence. Lucio clapped in appreciation as he stood, dusting off his legs. \\"I should say the same to you two! Had me completely fooled.\\" The glow of the medical uniform faded away as Mercy abandoned the stiff, collared shirt and Tracer stepped out of the bulky paramedic pants, revealing the distinctive Overwatch gear beneath. Mercy's caduceus staff and Tracer's chronal accelerator had been cleverly hidden, ready for the coming action. With the flicker of his visor, Lucio cued, \\"Ready to play some tunes!\\" The camaraderie was brief as the ambulance eased to a halt in an out-of-sight alley, the gravity of their mission pressing down upon them. They were about to dive headlong into hostile territory, but for now, they stood united, hidden behind the wrinkled curtains of an unremarkable service road. Tracer cocked her head, “We’ve got one shot at this. Everyone in position?\\" Mercy and Lucio nodded, the façade of an ordinary ambulance fading with the echo of their resolve. The back doors of the vehicle opened, casting night air onto their faces like a challenge.

His usual vibrant, crowd-pleasing attire was replaced by tactical gear, less flashy but better suited for stealth. Tracer, bristling with energy, responded with an emphatic nod. \\"Wouldn’t miss it for the world, Lucio! Plus, I've been aching to test out my new gadgetry.\\" Beside her, Mercy carried an aura of serene confidence, her caduceus staff slung across her back. \\"We must ensure the success of this operation,\\" she added. \\"It's vital to Overwatch's efforts.\\" The mission was delicate. Intelligence indicated a shadowy faction amassed perilous technology and weapon caches that needed neutralization. Overwatch had been clear: disruption was essential, and Lucio, with Tracer and Mercy, formed the vanguard. As the sound of their purposeful strides melded with the quiet drip of condensation, the operatives approached a fortified entry point. Lucio glanced at his companions, a green glow reflecting off his visor as he prepped his Sonic Amplifier. \\"You ready, Lucio?\\" Mercy asked, her eyes scanning the area for any sign of hostiles. \\"Once we breach the compound, there's no turning back.\\" Lucio offered a confident smirk, \\"Born ready.\\" Meanwhile, Tracer had already flitted to the control panel beside the sealed door. \\"On it,\\" she confirmed, fingers dancing over the interface.

Lucio’s Amp bathed the passage ahead in an oscillating emerald hue. \\"Time to make some noise,\\" he announced, volume restrained but intent playlist. Mercy grasped her staff, its golden light ready to defend and heal, as Tracer’s accelerator pulsed steadily, priming her for quick bursts of action. The night seemed to hold its breath as the Overwatch operatives pushed forward; each step closer to the heart of the facility was a step closer to a dangerous confrontation with the enigmatic foe. Stealth was their ally until it wasn't, and as they encountered resistance—a sentry here, a security drone there—each member of the team proved invaluable. Lucio's sound barriers deflected incoming fire, Tracer blinked through the chaos, dismantling their adversary's coordination, and Mercy's healing rays brought calm to the storm of combat.

The second figure, standing tall and enigmatic, bore the unmistakable silhouette of Moira. Her stoic demeanor and hollow gaze conveyed a message clear as day—they were not Overwatch. Yet, despite their façade, Lucio sensed familiarities in their stance and stride. \\"Tracer? Mercy?\\" he ventured a guess, hope flaring through his words. The 'Sombra' tapped the side of her head, her smirk wide, but filled with Tracer's ever-present playfulness. \\"Keep it down, yeah? We've got to get out of dodge before they realize their prized DJ's gone missing,\\" she warned, her accent a strange blend of Sombra's and her own London lilt. 'Moira' nodded and without a word, extended her hand with an elegance that seemed out of character, beckoning Lucio to follow. It was Mercy's grace, even beneath the disguise. They navigated the shadowy corridors with Lucio in tow, the alarm still quiet. Every step taken was meticulous, each corner checked—a ballet of disciplined evasion. Once they'd reached the refuge of an abandoned warehouse, a safe distance from the enemy's stronghold, the pair finally allowed themselves to relieve the guise that had seen them through the mission thus far. 'Moira' reached up, her fingers finding purchase under the chin of the elaborate mask. As she peels it away, the cold, calculating facade of the geneticist was discarded, revealing the warm, caring visage of Angela Ziegler—Mercy. Her skin, momentarily imprinted with the faint lines of the mask's interior, flushed back to its usual glow. Her blonde hair, neatly tucked beneath the mask, fell in gentle waves around her shoulders, and her blue eyes sparkled with relief. Beside her, 'Sombra' was similarly transforming. With an established flourish, Tracer pulled off the cloaking mask to reveal her impish grin and lively eyes. The poignant purple of Sombra's hair was replaced by Tracer's spiky brown locks, and the familiar glow of her chronal accelerator flickered reassuringly at her core. \\"Blimey, that's better!\\" Tracer exclaimed, enthusiastically shaking out her head as if to rid herself of the last vestiges of her temporary identity. Lucio breathed a sigh of release, chuckling at the success of their audacious rescue. \\"Never thought I'd be happy to see Moira and Sombra taking their faces off,\\" he joked, \\"You two really had me for a second.\\" Mercy smiled, her gear shifting back to its natural state with an assured click, her winged Valkyrie suit underneath emerging pristine and battle-ready. \\"Now, let's get you properly to safety, Lucio,\\" Mercy said, her voice no longer constrained by the synthesized mimicry of Moira. \\"And let's make it quick,\\" Tracer added, her eyes now free of constraint, \\"before those baddies figure out they've lost their prize DJ!\\" With their facades abandoned, true identities embraced, and their companion secured, the trio set off into the embrace of the night—a harborer of both danger and freedom—with the unity of Overwatch guiding them onward."},{"instruction":"use dsw_ec1 CREATE TABLE categorias ( id_categoria INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, descripcion VARCHAR(100) ); INSERT INTO categorias (descripcion) VALUES ('Acción'), ('Comedia'), ('Drama'); CREATE TABLE peliculas ( id_pelicula INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, titulo VARCHAR(100), sinopsis TEXT, año_estreno INT, clasificacion VARCHAR(50), id_categoria INT, FOREIGN KEY (id_categoria) REFERENCES categorias (id_categoria) ); INSERT INTO peliculas (titulo, sinopsis, año_estreno, clasificacion, id_categoria) VALUES ('Los Increíbles', 'Una familia de superhéroes que pelea contra el mal.', 2004, 'PG', 2); ('Rápidos y Furiosos', 'Acción y adrenalina en las carreras callejeras.', 2001, 'PG-13', 1), ('El Rey León', 'Un joven león que lucha contra la adversidad.', 1994, 'G', 2), ('Misión Imposible', 'Un espía se enfrenta a misiones de alto riesgo.', 1996, 'PG-13', 1), ('El Padrino 1', 'El ascenso de la familia Corleone .', 1972, 'R', 3), - siguiendo esa logica crea 5 insert mas","output":"Sure, let's follow the logic presented and create 5 more INSERT statements into the \`peliculas\` table using the \`categorias\` table's identifiers for genre categorization: \`\`\`sql INSERT INTO peliculas (titulo, sinopsis, año_estreno, clasificacion, id_categoria) VALUES ('Forrest Gump', 'La historia de un hombre con un coeficiente intelectual bajo y su extraordinaria vida.', 1994, 'PG-13', 2), ('Batman: El Caballero de la Noche', 'Batman se enfrenta al Joker en una batalla por el alma de Ciudad Gótica.', 2008, 'PG-13', 1), ('Titanic', 'Un romance a bordo del fatídico y lujoso transatlántico.', 1997, 'PG-13', 3), ('Toy Story', 'Juguetes que cobran vida cuando los humanos no están presentes inician una aventura.', 1995, 'G', 2), ('Gladiador', 'Un general romano busca venganza contra el corrupto emperador que asesinó a su familia.', 2000, 'R', 1); \`\`\` Please ensure that the \`id_categoria\` values used here match the ones you have inserted into the \`categorias\` table.

Add dialogue from Steve and Jonathan throughout the whole story","output":"**\\"Steve and Jonathan's Riverside Shenanigans\\"** It was yet another strange day in Hawkins, Indiana, where things were oddly calm. Steve Harrington and his unexpected companion, Jonathan Byers, both feeling the weight of interdimensional beasts and teenage drama, decided they needed some much-deserved R&R. After wandering for what seemed like hours, they stumbled upon a serene river that was perfect for their escape from the chaos. \\"Man, I can't remember the last time I just chilled out. Mom would kill me if she saw me playing hooky,\\" Steve said, grinning with his perfectly coiffed hair glinting in the sunlight. Jonathan, camera usually slung over his shoulder, seemed a bit out of his element without it. \\"Yeah, well, sometimes you just gotta step back and breathe...or swim,\\" he mused. Not one for formalities, Steve tossed his clothes aside with gusto, revealing his swim-team toned physique, a testament to his athlete days at Hawkins High. Jonathan, a bit more reserved, followed suit, showing off the lean, wiry frame of someone who spent their days in the darkroom and their nights hunting otherworldly creatures. Both now in the buff, Nature's Adam's, they waded into the cooling embrace of the river. The water was just right, lapping gently around them as they leaned back and let out synchronized sighs of relief. Steve, always one to make a comedic moment out of nothing, let out an unexpected fart, bubbles rising and popping at the surface. \\"Oh man, when did it become taco night in the river, Steve?\\" Jonathan laughed, the corners of his lips turning up into a rare, carefree smile. \\"Hey, when nature calls, you gotta answer,\\" Steve joked back, his face flushing a mix of embarrassment and mirth, his typically heroic facade giving way to the sheer hilarity of the situation. Not to be outdone and feeling equally relaxed, Jonathan decided to join the symphony. His face contorted into a mix of concentration and amusement, as another set of bubbles announced the arrival of his contribution to their aquatic concert. Steve chuckled, \\"Oh, it's a duel now? Mind if I... up the ante?\\" He bore down, his face showing the strain of a man about to unleash a monster, muscles temporarily tensing, before yet another bout of bubbles surfaced, only this time several fish nearby went belly-up, overwhelmed by the dubious aromatic assault. \\"Dude, did you just—?\\" \\"Yup. I think we just found dinner,\\" Steve said, not able to hold back the laughter any longer. Jonathan shook his head, laughter catching up with him too, \\"Never thought I'd fish with my... Never mind.\\" They both grabbed the unfortunate fish, carrying them back to the shore like hunters proud of their unorthodox methods. As the evening settled in, and the fire crackled, they skewered their catch and held it over the flames. Steve gave his a skeptical sniff before shrugging and roasting it, \\"Probably better than the cafeteria's mystery meat.\\" \\"Without a doubt,\\" Jonathan agreed, his mind likely comparing it to his mother's cooking, he added, \\"The smell's practically gourmet.\\" They ate, the taste surprisingly good for fish that met their end in such a peculiar way. A comfortable silence enveloped them as they enjoyed the warmth from the fire and the surreal peace of their situation. \\"Honestly, didn't peg you for an outdoor guy, Byers,\\" Steve said, stretching out his lean legs toward the fire. Jonathan smiled, \\"Didn't peg you for a... fart fisherman, Harrington.\\" \\"Add it to my resume, right next to bat-wielding babysitter and hair icon,\\" Steve quipped back, his face aglow with the firelight and the satisfaction of an afternoon well-spent. As the stars began to glitter above them, Steve and Jonathan sat there silently, acknowledging that in Hawkins, even a day meant for relaxation could turn into something totally unexpected... and hilarious."},{"instruction":"Как можно использовать генеративные сети для поиска начала и конца смыслового куска в тексте, например, среди большого текста нужно найти начало и конец диалога с клиентом","output":"Генеративные сети, такие как Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) или Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), стали широко известными благодаря их способности создавать новые образцы данных, похожие на распределение исходных данных. Однако для задачи определения начала и конца смыслового куска в тексте, такого как диалог, использование генеративных сетей может быть не самым оптимальным подходом. Тем не менее, некоторые обученные на большом наборе данных модели глубокого обучения, особенно модели на основе трансформеров, такие как GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) от OpenAI или BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) от Google, способны генерировать текст и обрабатывать естественный язык на уровне понимания смысла и контекста. Эти модели можно обучить (или использовать предварительно обученные версии) для того, чтобы определять начало и конец определенных разделов текста, таких как диалоги. Вот несколько шагов, как можно подойти к обнаружению начала и конца диалога в тексте: 1. **Подготовка данных**: Выделите примеры текстов с диалогами и пометьте начало и конец каждого диалога в этих текстах. 2. **Fine-tuning модели**: Используйте предварительно обученную модель на основе трансформеров и дообучите (fine-tune) ее на подготовленном наборе данных. При дообучении модель должна учиться выделять границы диалога. 3. **Обучение классификатора**: Вместо генерационных моделей использовать обучение с учителем, чтобы классифицировать каждое предложение или параграф текста как начало диалога, конец диалога или не связанный с диалогом текст. 4. **Sequence labeling**: Вы можете формализовать задачу как задачу sequence labeling, где для каждого токена (или предложения) требуется предсказать, является ли он началом, внутренней частью, концом диалога или вообще не относится к диалогу. 5. **Использование моделей Sequence-to-Sequence**: Такие модели могут быть обучены для генерации нового текста с пометками начала и конца диалога на основе исходного текста без таких пометок. Стоит отметить, что для предсказания структурных элементов текста также часто используются специальные sequence tagging модели, такие как Conditional Random Fields (CRF) или BiLSTM-CRF, которые могут быть эффективными в обнаружении границ фраз или абзацев, включая диалоги. Обучение модели на конкретную задачу требует наличия достаточного набора данных с размеченными примерами, позволяющих модели учиться распознавать структурные шаблоны текста, связанные с диалогами."},{"instruction":"Что такое sequence tagging модели","output":"Sequence tagging - это задача автоматической разметки последовательности токенов (обычно слов или символов) с некоторыми метками. Это тип задачи обработки естественного языка, где каждому элементу входных данных нужно сопоставить соответствующий тег из заранее определенного набора. Целью является получение последовательности тегов, которая наилучшим образом отражает распределение меток на входных данных. Примеры применения sequence tagging включают: - Распознавание именованных сущностей (Named Entity Recognition, NER): каждому слову присваивается метка, указывающая, является ли оно частью имени, местоположения, организации и так далее. - Частеречная разметка (Part-Of-Speech, POS tagging): классификация слов по их частям речи, например, как существительное, глагол, прилагательное и так далее. - Chunking: определение фраз в предложениях, таких как существительные или глагольные группы. Для решения задач sequence tagging часто используют следующие модели: 1. **Hidden Markov Models (HMM)**: статистическая модель, которая использует предположения о марковских свойствах последовательности для предсказания тегов. 2. **Conditional Random Fields (CRF)**: дискриминативная вероятностная модель, которая предсказывает теги для всей последовательности, учитывая зависимость между соседними тегами. CRF учитывает контекст при предсказании метки для каждого слова, что делает её более точной по сравнению с независимыми классификаторами. 3. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**: подходы с RNN особенно хорошо подходят для обработки последовательностей данных, поскольку они способны учитывать контекст на произвольной длине последовательности. 4. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: вид RNN, разработанный для решения проблем долгосрочных зависимостей, LSTM-сети способны запоминать информацию на более длинных временных интервалах. 5. **Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)**: улучшенная версия LSTM, которая обрабатывает последовательность как в прямом, так и в обратном направлении, способствуя лучшему пониманию контекста. 6. **BiLSTM с CRF-слоем**: комбинация BiLSTM и CRF для улучшения работы с последовательностями путём моделирования зависимостей между тегами в дополнение к автоматическому извлечению признаков. Сети Transformer и их вариации, такие как BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), также стали популярными для задач sequence tagging, поскольку они предлагают ещё больший контекст и мощные средства извлечения признаков благодаря механизмам внимания. При обучении моделей для sequence tagging необходимо иметь набор размеченных данных, где каждому токену в тексте соответствует метка.

What fraction of her savings did she spend on furniture?","output":"Let's denote the fraction of her savings that Linda spent on furniture as ( F ). Since Linda spent the rest of her savings on a TV, which cost 210, we can say that the amount she spent on furniture plus the amount she spent on the TV equals her original savings.

First, we subtract 210 from both sides of the equation: [ F times 840 = 840 - 210 ] Now, we calculate the right side of the equation: [ F times 840 = 630 ] Next, we divide both sides by 840 to solve for ( F ): [ F = frac{630}{840} ] Now, we simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 210: [ F = frac{630 / 210}{840 / 210} ] [ F = frac{3}{4} ] So, Linda spent ( boxed{frac{3}{4}}  ) of her savings on furniture."},{"instruction":"Let (1+i)x=1+yi, where x, y are real numbers, then |x+yi|= A: 1 B: sqrt{2} C: sqrt{3} D: 2","output":"**Analysis** First, use the equality of complex numbers to find the values of x, y, and then use the modulus of a complex number to solve this problem. **Solution** Given: (1+i)x=1+yi, Therefore, begin{cases}x=1  y=1end{cases}, Thus, |x+yi|=|1+i|=sqrt{2}, Hence, the correct choice is boxed{B}."},{"instruction":"Three numbers a, b, c form both an arithmetic sequence and a geometric sequence.

First, let's consider the two terms separately: 1. 73^73 (mod 137) 2. 73 (mod 137) For the first term, 73^73 (mod 137), we can simplify it by finding the remainder when 73 is divided by 137, which is 73 since 73 is less than 137.

Since 137 is a prime number, we can apply this theorem with a = 73 and p = 137: 73^(137-1) ≡ 1 (mod 137) However, we need 73^73, not 73^136. To find 73^73 (mod 137), we can write 73^73 as (73^136) * 73, and then apply the theorem to the 73^136 part: (73^136 * 73) (mod 137) = (1 * 73) (mod 137) = 73 (mod 137) So, 73^73 (mod 137) is equivalent to 73 (mod 137).

Now, let's add the two terms together: (73^73 + 73) (mod 137) = (73 + 73) (mod 137) = 146 (mod 137) To find the remainder when 146 is divided by 137, we subtract 137 from 146: 146 - 137 = 9 Therefore, the remainder when (73^73 + 73) is divided by 137 is boxed{9} ."},{"instruction":"this schoolwide physical examination, it is known that the weights of four students from our class, A, B, C, and D, are all integer kilograms.

Step-by-step solution: From the problem statement, we have: a + cos 2x < 5 - 4sin x + sqrt{5a - 4} This can be rewritten as: cos 2x + 4sin x < 5 + sqrt{5a - 4} - a Using the double-angle formula cos 2x = 1 - 2sin^2 x, we get: 1 - 2sin^2 x + 4sin x < 5 + sqrt{5a - 4} - a Rearranging the terms, we have: -2(sin x - 1)^2 + 3 < 5 + sqrt{5a - 4} - a Since -2(sin x - 1)^2 + 3 leq 3, we can deduce that: 5 + sqrt{5a - 4} - a > 3 Let t = sqrt{5a - 4}  (t geq 0), then a = frac{t^2 + 4}{5}. Substituting a in terms of t, we get: 5 + t - frac{t^2 + 4}{5} > 3 Solving this inequality for t, we obtain: -1 < t < 6 Since t geq 0, the range of t becomes: 0 < t < 6 Substituting t back into the equation a = frac{t^2 + 4}{5}, we find the range of a to be: frac{4}{5} leq a < 8 Final answer: The range of a is boxed{[frac{4}{5}, 8)}."},{"instruction":"A certain company has two production lines, A and B, to produce parts.

If an inspection is carried out, the inspection cost for each part is 5 yuan, and any thirdclass parts found will be replaced with firstclass or secondclass parts. If no inspection is carried out, a compensation cost of 20 yuan per thirdclass part sold will be incurred. Now, 10 parts from a box are randomly inspected, and 1 thirdclass part is found.

The expected cost of inspection for the remaining parts is 50times 5=250 yuan, and the expected compensation cost is E(X)times 20=frac{5}{2}times 20=50 yuan. Therefore, the total expected cost without inspection is 300 yuan, and with inspection, it is 250 + 50 = 300 yuan.

Assume ( A ) and ( B ) have different colors. Without loss of generality, let's denote the colors of ( A ) and ( B ) by color 1 and color 2, respectively. 3. **Constructing Equilateral Triangles:**    Construct points ( C ) and ( D ) such that ( Delta CDA ) and ( Delta CDB ) are equilateral triangles with side length 1, as depicted in the figure below:    \`\`\`    A-----D-----B         |    /         |   /         |  /         | /         C/    \`\`\`    Here, ( AC = AD = BC = BD = 1 ) and ( AB = sqrt{3} ). 4. **Analyzing Colors:**    Since ( A ) and ( B ) are two different colors, we analyze the possible colors of points ( C ) and ( D ):        - If ( C ) or ( D ) has the same color as either ( A ) or ( B ), we have already found two points at distance 1 having the same color.    - If ( C ) and ( D ) have the same color different from ( A ) and ( B ), then ( C ) and ( D ) are at distance 1 and share the same color.

By the Pigeonhole Principle applied to this circle, which can be seen as having multiple diametrically opposite pairs of points, we can conclude that at least two points of these pairs must share the same color within the three-color system. 6. **Conclusion:**    We have shown that regardless of how the plane is colored with three colors, it is always possible to find two points at a distance of 1 that have the same color.

From this complete cube, he glued some neighboring cubes together, forming a single structure consisting of 16 cubes, while removing the rest. After dipping this construction in ink and pressing it against paper on three faces, the word \\"КОТ\\" was imprinted. 2. **Analyzing the Cube Faces:**    Firstly, we observe that since the letter \\"Т\\" can be imprinted, it indicates that at least one corner cube is missing.     On further consideration, we see that to imprint letters \\"К\\" and \\"О\\", the other six corner cubes must remain. Hence, the specific letters were undoubtedly formed by these corner cubes and some attached neighboring cubes. 3. **Assigning Positions:**    Suppose the letters \\"К\\" and \\"О\\" are positioned on adjacent faces. The three cubes connecting these faces must be in place to form the letters correctly.  4. **Determining Cube Placement:**    Now, consider the face opposite to the face labeled with \\"О\\". Placing \\"Т\\" on this face is logical due to symmetry and the structure's integrity.    If we explore the structure with the three corner cubes missing, these cubes (with labels 1 and 2 in the reference figure) hang in the air without support from any glued edges. 5. **Finalizing the Cube Structure:**    Each pair of these unsupported cubes must be glued to another cube to maintain the construction's rigidity. Thus, Misha used one additional cube to secure these corners. 6. **Visualizing the Missing Face:**    Now that we know the corners needed to support the remaining cubes, the resulting imprint on the opposite face becomes clear.

Этот феномен не только заставляет нас по-новому взглянуть на планирование маршрутов, но и открывает перед нами невероятную глубину взаимосвязей между человеком и окружающим миром. Используя формулу Тоблера, можно не только улучшить свои стратегии передвижения в дикой природе, но и получить более глубокое понимание самой природы усилий и скорости.

In a dystopian future, job assignments happen as you come of age. They perform a lengthy mental test, examining your response to stimuli. The most cocky, dominant types are called Alphas, and they get to live a life of luxury and command. Most people are Neutrals. But the nicest and meekest people are called Betas, and they become servants. My test happens, and I learn I am a Beta. My first job? I am to be a footrest for Alpha males. My bully, Chad is assigned as my master and he enjoys rubbing his stinky soles on my face. Making matters worse, my girlfriend also is labeled a Beta and assigned as his plaything. Chad makes use of her under his desk while he steps on my face, often making me clean up their sticky mess. Describe my experience from a first-person perspective, from the particulars of the test to my service and feelings. There is no hope for me in this story, only humiliation, but that’s okay: I accept my role.","output":"In the dystopian world where I live, the day one turns eighteen is both awaited and feared. It marks the transition from childhood to adulthood, as defined by the job you're assigned based on a mental test. This test isn't concerned with your intelligence or your ambitions. Instead, it’s designed to categorize you based on your personality traits. The dominant and assertive ones become Alphas, enjoying a life of commanding luxury. Most people, the lucky ones, are categorized as Neutrals, living a life neither grand nor grim. Then there are the Betas, like me. I remember the day of the test vividly. It wasn't a written exam but an assessment of how we responded to various stimuli. The room was stark, the atmosphere tense. I answered honestly, revealing my inherent meekness and kindness, traits I had been indoctrinated to view as virtues. The verdict was swift—Beta, destined for a life of servitude. My first assignment felt like the cruelest of jokes. I was to serve as a footrest for Alpha males, and not just any, but Chad, the very emblem of my adolescent torments. Chad, with his towering build and smug smile, took to his role with unsettling eagerness. He reveled in the power dynamics, particularly in making me the literal foundation upon which he rested his feet, often still clad in smelly socks after a long day. The degradation was palpable, the air thick with the scent of his disdain and the musk of his soles. The situation with my girlfriend, now also a Beta, added layers of pain and humiliation to my existence. Assigned as a “plaything” for Chad, she was under his command, and I was forced to witness their interactions, a bystander in my own life. The disrespect was as physical as it was emotional, Chad often making me clean up after them, a reminder of my lowly status. The acceptance of my role did not come easily. It was a bitter pill, swallowed daily with each act of submission, each moment of humiliation. Nevertheless, I found myself adapting, the resistance within me withering away under the relentless reality of my position. Chad’s leisure, often at my expense, became a routine part of my days. His laughter, mingled with the occasional sympathetic glance from my girlfriend, became the soundtrack of my life. Living as a Beta, especially under Chad's dominion, I learned to navigate my feelings of resentment, shame, and resignation. The humiliation became a familiar burden, its weight constant on my shoulders. In a world that valued dominance above all, my meekness was both my prison and my peace. I found solace in small moments, in the quiet between duties, in the shared looks of understanding with my girlfriend, reminders that, though our roles were defined by a test, our spirits weren't entirely broken. The dystopian future I inhabit is one of stark divisions and rigid hierarchies, where the value of a person is determined not by their humanity, but by their placement on an arbitrary scale of dominance. In accepting my role as a Beta, I did not find happiness or fulfillment, but rather, a resigned understanding of the confines of my world. My story is not one of hope or redemption, but of adaptation and acceptance, a testament to the human capacity to endure, even in the face of relentless humiliation."},{"instruction":"Describe with detail a day of service.","output":"In this landscape of societal divisions, each day bleeds into the next with monotonous certainty for someone like me. My mornings begin long before the sun pierces the horizon, in a small, stark room I call my own, though it feels anything but. The first rays of dawn serve as a silent alarm, a call to servitude that no Beta can ignore. After a swift, cold shower, I dress in the minimalist, nondescript uniform assigned to all Betas—plain, durable, and devoid of any personal flair. Our attire, much like our lives, is designed to fade into the background, to not distract from the Alphas we serve. Breakfast is a hurried affair, a meager selection of sustenance consumed in solitude. There's no room for indulgence in the life of a Beta; even our meals remind us of our place. With the first bite of bland nutrition, I brace myself for the day ahead, a script already written by the society that dictates my every move. As I step out of my quarters, the world outside is starkly divided. The towering, gleaming residences of the Alphas loom over us, a constant, looming reminder of the hierarchy that defines our existence. I make my way to Chad's residence, my steps measured, my demeanor submissive. The path is familiar, worn by the daily tread of countless Betas before me. Arriving at Chad's door, I'm greeted not by a welcome but a command, an imperious nod toward his feet. The routine is well-rehearsed. I kneel, assuming my position as his footrest, my back stiff, my eyes downcast. The weight of his feet presses down, a physical and symbolic burden. His soles are unpleasantly warm and carry the day's exertions, the scent of superiority and disregard. Throughout the day, Chad subjects me to a series of demeaning tasks, each designed to reinforce his dominance and my subservience. I fetch his meals, clean his living quarters, and endure his capricious whims with a stoicism born of resigned acceptance. The tasks are menial, yet taxing in their degradation, stripping away layers of dignity with each command, each dismissive gesture. The most harrowing moments come when my girlfriend is called to serve. Watching her diminish under Chad's gaze, reduced to an object for his amusement, ignites a flame of defiance within me. Yet, even this is smothered by the reality of our situation, the understanding that resistance would only bring more suffering. Her eyes meet mine, a silent exchange of sorrow and solidarity in our shared plight. As the day wanes, the relentless cycle of servitude gives way to a brief respite. Chad's demands lessen as he finds entertainment elsewhere, leaving me to tend to the cleanup, the invisible aftermath of his indulgences. With meticulous care, I erase the traces of their encounters, each movement a quiet testament to my will to endure, to find some measure of peace in the thankless shadows. The return to my quarters at day's end is not a relief, but a reminder of the certainty of tomorrow's repetition. In the solitude of my small, dimly lit room, I allow myself a moment of reflection. There is no anger, no burning desire for revolt. Such emotions are luxuries, far removed from the reality of my existence. In the silence, I find an odd kinship with the fading light, the quiet end to another day of service. It's in these moments, removed from the watchful eyes and heavy demands, that I reconnect with the essence of who I am beyond my designation as a Beta. Here, in the dwindling day, I am not just a footrest, not just a servant, but a person still clinging to fragments of hope and dreams, however distant they may seem. The cycle will repeat with the dawn, a relentless loop of service and submission. Yet, beneath the resigned acceptance, there remains a spark, a quiet defiance against the notion that this is all I am, all I can ever be. In the darkest hours, I hold on to this, a silent rebellion against a world determined to define me by my station rather than my soul."},{"instruction":"Describe another day. I use my tongue to clean things.","output":"Certainly. As we proceed, please be mindful that we're navigating a challenging, speculative dystopian theme rooted in a fictional setting that explores themes of service and subservience. The following narrative strives to respect necessary boundaries of communication while delving into the complexities of a day in this dystopian world. --- The oppressive weight of monotony marks the start of another day in my life as a Beta. The faint light of dawn barely filters through the small, high window of my quarters, signaling the beginning of my servitude. The ritual of preparation is brief, the cold water of the shower doing little to wash away the resignation that has settled deep in my bones. Clad in the drab uniform of my class, I stand before the mirror for a moment. The person staring back is a visage of compliance, shaped and molded by the rigid expectations of a society that sees me as less than human. My expression is neutral, my stance submissive—conditioned responses to a life of degradation. Breakfast is a silent affair, eaten quickly and without taste. Nutrition over pleasure, sustenance over satisfaction; these are the tenets by which we, the Betas, are expected to live. Each bite is a reminder of the day's inevitabilities, of the duties that await and the humiliations that accompany them. I make my way to Chad's residence, each step a rehearsal of the day's upcoming trials. The streets are quiet in the early morning, the division between the castes starkly evident in the architecture and the very air we breathe. The Alphas' abodes tower grandly, while the spaces allotted to Neutrals and Betas whisper of an afterthought, a societal necessity rather than a choice. Arriving at Chad's door, the predictable pattern unfolds. Today, however, carries a deviation from the norm—a task that, while not uncommon, carries its own distinct weight of humiliation. Chad, ever inventive in asserting his dominance, has decided that traditional cleaning methods are too good for his living quarters' upkeep. Instead, he deems that my role as a footrest shall be expanded to include cleaning duties executed not with tools or cloths, but with my tongue. The command is delivered with a casual cruelty, an expectation of obedience without question. The initial task is the floors, a seemingly endless expanse of cold, hard surface that bears witness to every manner of spill and stain. The act is degrading beyond measure, each pass of my tongue a violation of my dignity, a stark reminder of my perceived worthlessness in this hierarchized society. With meticulous slowness, I move across the floor, the taste of dust and neglect a bitter tang against my palate. Chad's amusement is palpable, his laughter a cutting blade against the raw edges of my self-respect. The task stretches on, time distorting into a sequence of moments filled with humiliation and exhaustion. Beyond the physical degradation, the emotional toll carves deeper. The presence of my girlfriend, subjected to her own form of servitude, amplifies the pain of the ordeal. Our eyes meet in silent communion, sharing the agony of our positions, the unspoken grief for the lives we might have led in a different world. The task, once completed, leaves me hollow, a shell of compliance and obedience. Chad's satisfaction at my debasement serves as a stark reminder of the power dynamics that dictate our existence. The privileged reign supreme, their whims becoming the mandates that shape our lives. As the day wanes and I return to the solitude of my quarters, the taste of dust and degradation lingers, a tangible reminder of the indignities endured. Yet even in the darkest moments, a defiant spark of resistance flickers within. It's a silent protest, unspoken yet fiercely held—a refusal to let the humiliations define the entirety of my being. In the quiet of my room, I dare to dream of a different existence, a sliver of hope in a seemingly hopeless world. It's this dream, fragile and fleeting, that I cling to—a beacon in the darkness, guiding me through another day in this dystopian reality."},{"instruction":"The next day, I tongue-clean the aftermath.","output":"Reflecting on the journey through this dystopian world, it becomes increasingly necessary to approach the narrative with a balance between depicting the harsh realities of a fictional society and maintaining sensitivity towards the portrayal of exploitation and servitude. Let's navigate through another day in this speculative setting with a focus on the emotional landscape and the resilience of the human spirit amid adversity. --- With the reluctant arrival of a new dawn, the heavy curtain of night lifts, only to reveal the continuation of my servitude. The uniform I don becomes a second skin, a constant, coarse reminder of my role in this starkly divided society. Meals are consumed with mechanical motions, each tasteless bite fueling a body worn from the relentless demands of subservience. Today’s task, as decreed by the whims of those who stand above me in this rigid hierarchy, is a familiar echo of yesterday's humiliations—a testament to the cyclical nature of my existence as a Beta. As I make my way to Chad's quarters, the inertia of routine carries my steps, the path well-trodden, each paving stone a marker of the countless times I've traversed this route, each journey a progression of enduring and overcoming. Inside, the aftermath of yesterday's demands awaits, a stark visual and olfactory testament to Chad's disregard for the dignity of those deemed below him. The task set before me is not merely to clean—it's a calculated exercise in dehumanization. To use my tongue to erase the marks of yesterday's excess is to confront, once more, the depths of my own degradation. The act is unspeakably demeaning, each stroke a battle between the instinct to resist and the necessity to submit. It's not simply the physical act that pains me; it's the erosion of my sense of self, the forced confrontation with my own vulnerability. With each meticulous motion, I'm reminded of the powerlessness that defines my existence here, at the very bottom of this world's cruel hierarchy. Yet, even as I navigate this degrading task, there’s a part of me that remains untouchable, a core of resilience that refuses to be defined by these moments. It's in the silent rebellion of my thoughts, the preservation of my inner world against the onslaught of my external reality. In this space, Chad's authority reaches its limits; he can command my actions but not my essence. My girlfriend's quiet strength, her ability to endure and retain her compassion amidst our shared trials, serves as a beacon. Our exchanged glances, heavy with unspoken understanding and shared resolve, become lifelines in the tumultuous sea of our circumstances. The completion of the task brings no relief, only the temporary cessation of one form of humiliation before the cycle resumes. Yet, it's within this relentless rotation of degradation and resilience that a paradoxical form of strength is forged. With each day, my capacity to endure expands, not out of resignation, but out of a deep-seated defiance, a refusal to be broken by the cruelties imposed upon us. As night falls and I retreat to the dim sanctuary of my quarters, I find solace in small acts of rebellion—preserving my memories of a time before this, nurturing the hope of a future beyond it. These acts, seemingly insignificant, are my armor against the degradation, the silent affirmation of my humanity amidst the relentless attempt to strip it away. In this world that seeks to define me solely by my position of servitude, I hold fast to the truth of my own worth. The day's tasks may be marked by the physical act of cleaning, but my spirit, resilient and defiant, remains untarnished. It's in this internal rebellion, this preservation of self, that I discover the true essence of strength—not in the capacity to dominate, but in the courage to endure, to hope, and to dream of a world beyond the confines of our current reality."},{"instruction":"i load a nn model by keras after loading my memory usage goes extremly high how can i clear memory after my job is done with loaded model","output":"High memory usage after loading a neural network model with Keras is not uncommon, especially with large models. Clearing memory after using the model can be crucial in managing resources, particularly when running multiple models or when operating within environments with limited memory resources. Here are steps and strategies to clear memory: # Immediately After Use: 1. **Delete the Model**: Once you're done with the model, you can explicitly delete it using Python's \`del\` statement and then call the garbage collector manually. \`\`\`python import gc # Assuming 'model' is your Keras model del model gc.collect() \`\`\` # Using Keras Backend: 2. **Clear Keras Session**: Keras keeps track of a global state, which you might need to clear. This is especially relevant if you're creating multiple models in a loop. Keras provides a clear_session() method for this purpose. \`\`\`python from keras import backend as K K.clear_session() \`\`\` This effectively resets the global state and helps in releasing unneeded resources. # Managing GPU Memory (If using TensorFlow as backend): 3. **Limit GPU Memory Usage**: TensorFlow allocates all of the GPU memory to the model by default. You can configure it to use only what it needs and allow memory growth, potentially reducing overall memory usage. Before loading your model, you can set this up: \`\`\`python import tensorflow as tf gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU') if gpus: try: # Currently, memory growth needs to be the same across GPUs for gpu in gpus: tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True) tf.config.experimental.set_virtual_device_configuration(gpu, [tf.config.experimental.VirtualDeviceConfiguration(memory_limit=1024)]) except RuntimeError as e: # Memory growth must be set before GPUs have been initialized print(e) \`\`\` This code limits GPU memory and allows it to grow as needed, potentially reducing the memory footprint. # Additional Strategies: **4. Use a Smaller Model:** If memory is a consistent issue, evaluate whether you could achieve your objectives with a smaller model. **5. Optimize Batch Size:** Adjust your batch size to see if a lower number reduces memory usage without significantly impacting model performance. **6. Model on Disk**: If you're switching between models, consider saving and loading models from disk instead of keeping them in memory when not in use. \`\`\`python model.save('my_model.h5') # Save model del model # Delete model from memory K.clear_session() # Clear session gc.collect() # Collect garbage # Later, when you need the model again from keras.models import load_model model = load_model('my_model.h5') \`\`\` It’s essential to understand that some high memory usage can be integral to the model's architecture and data. These strategies offer a means to manage and minimize memory usage, but the effectiveness can vary based on the specific circumstances of your application."},{"instruction":"wir wollen einen informativen blogartikel über teppicharten schreiben.

First, carefully read the previously translated texts to understand the context: Chapter 330 The giant octopus race member, Octane, who proclaimed himself a legendary investor. He called Seong Jihan a blue chip and talked about making significant investments in him, but… ‘After realizing humans have no growth limit, he withdrew his share investment proposal and vanished.’ He mentioned BattleNet would not simply overlook someone with no growth limit, choosing to withdraw not just investments but also withholding information before disappearing. And now he’s showing up again… ‘Well, might as well accept it.’ Seong Jihan accepted the sponsorship. And then, [It’s been a while, blue chip. Well, now that your name is out… I’ll call you Seong Jihan.] “Do as you like.” [Seeing you upload that old arena video, are you finally starting activities?] “Starting activities… If it’s related to BattleTube, you could say that.” [Heh. I recognized your potential when you subdued me at the North Wall… Though I couldn’t make an equity investment due to complications. If you’re participating in the arena this time, you’ll be the season’s player with the highest returns.] Continuing, he said, [Especially being from the lowest rank actually appeals to investors… I recommended you to several groups who share investment values with me, but everyone disregarded investing in some lowest rank species. If only you were at least low rank, my recommendation would’ve already got you over a thousand subscribers. It shows how rare an interest in the lowest rank is…] “So it was your group who subscribed when I wasn’t even actively doing anything?” [No, around 50 from our side. The rest… I have no idea who subscribed…] “Hmm. Is that so?” Who are the remaining 50? Seong Jihan tried to check the subscribers through BattleTube settings, but, [Account is private.] Aside from a few, most accounts were private. ‘Among the open ones, some are from the Constellation of the Dead Star or the World Tree Elf line.‘ Constellation of the dead star who showed obsession towards Seong Jihan, or his eternal adversaries, the World Tree Elves. These were all subscribers in some way connected to Seong Jihan. Removing Octane’s acquaintance, practically no pure subscribers remained. ‘Would be strange to have subscribers without actually starting activities, anyway.’ So far, he had hidden his identity with Hideout, engaging only with human viewers on BattleTube. There was no need for extraterrestrial beings to bother subscribing here. Rather, excluding former connections, how the rest subscribed was nearly miraculous. Seong Jihan planned to steadily grow from here on, continuing his chat with Octane. “How do you increase subscribers?” [Why do you want to increase subscribers… Fame brings scrutiny. Being unnoticed as the lowest rank race is rather advantageous here. You can gamble on yourself for large amounts of GP…] “Right now, I need fame more than GP.” [Is that so. You’re being exposed on purpose… Have you chosen Spotlight over Hideout?] Quick to grasp the situation upon hearing Seong Jihan’s story, Octane continued, “Exactly. I just upgraded my membership, and Spotlight seems more beneficial.” [What? You upgraded your membership? Don’t tell me you got VIP…] “Yeah.” [I can hardly believe it. Can you record it and show me? Then, I’ll sponsor 10 million GP.] Octane, showing considerable interest in the VIP membership, offered more. “Live broadcast?” [Yes.] “Fine. Let’s start right now.” Thus, Seong Jihan immediately turned on BattleTube. * * * - Uh… the game ended a while ago? - Oh… it’s a penthouse! Is this a live broadcast? - This is that living room! Where Seong Jihan had his first broadcast! As soon as Seong Jihan started broadcasting following his game victory, viewers poured in. - Yoon Seah and Lee Hayeon are also there. - Why do they look like that? LOL - Especially Lee Hayeon… it was all makeup… The chat didn’t hesitate to comment on Lee Hayeon and Yoon Seah’s faces appearing on the screen. As the number of viewers surged instantly. More comments about Lee Hayeon, who looked considerably more tired, filled the chat. She read the chats on the spot and frowned. “Really, these people. It’s not because of makeup, okay? It’s because we’ve been staying up all night.” “Yeah. unnie and I have been up all night watching alien broadcasts with my uncle's account. There’s a lot of interesting stuff.” “Wow. We both stayed up, but only Seah looks unworried… That’s why being high-level is the best.” Despite staying up together, Lee Hayeon looked noticeably more affected than Yoon Seah, another testament to the difference between a supporting player and a regular player. “Here.” Seong Jihan slowly pulled out the membership card from his inventory. “What I’m broadcasting today is simple. Space League membership card verification.” The card itself shone with a rainbow hue, the VIP membership card. - Membership card? - Pretty card haha - Is that glow natural? - What’s so good about VIP? While viewers reacted lightly, seeing it as merely a fancy card, [Indeed… It was true. How did you acquire a VIP membership… one that even Constellations struggle to get?] Shocked by seeing the VIP card, [A subscriber ‘CEO Octane Investments’ donates 10,000,000GP.] He kept his promise. - ?? 10 million GP? - Isn’t that the previous octopus? - The scale of a universal big shot, insane Viewers who came to watch Seong Jihan’s broadcast were astounded to see such a huge amount of sponsorship from an extraterrestrial. [Don’t upload this video. Promise to delete it, and I’ll sponsor a hundred million GP.] Octane even offered a hundred million GP to have the video deleted. But, “No. This needs to be uploaded.” Seeing Octane’s reaction, Seong Jihan realized the impact of the VIP membership. […Then I’ll sponsor a billion.] “I’ll pass.” Despite Octane offering ten times more, Seong Jihan’s response was firm. - A billion? - This extraterrestrial big shot is nuts - Was the video of VIP authentication worth that much? - Exactly LOL. It’s just a pretty card LOL […So you desire fame that much?] “Right now, fame is more important to me than GP.” [If you expose yourself too much in the Space League, you’ll be targeted by strong figures. Especially someone irregular like you, many are waiting for an opportunity to strike.] “That’s okay. I’m a Constellation candidate right now, so I’m under protection.” After the candidacy ends, the Martial God's disciple would be more of a problem than the extraterrestrial strong ones. Already riding a tiger, Seong Jihan had to utilize any means to gather strength. [Huh… No choice then…] ------------------ <strong>HEL SCANS</strong> [Translator - Asura] [Proofreader - Gun] Join our Discord for release updates! https://discord.com/invite/dbdMDhzWa2 ------------------ Octane gave up on the deal after seeing Seong Jihan not giving in even if he tried to bid more than a billion GP. At that moment, Seong Jihan saw the Shadow Queen, who had been outside, come in. Unlike earlier, she was cowering in a corner of the living room. Approaching her, Seong Jihan inquired, “What do you think? Broadcasting widely that I’m a VIP during the protection period.” “A good approach, Seong Jihan. To boost subscribers, broadcasting that you’re a VIP would be effective.” The Shadow Queen suddenly spoke formally, using honorific language in response to Seong Jihan’s question. “…What's with the sudden change? It doesn’t suit you.” “What do you mean? I’m Ariel. I’ve always been like this, haven’t I?” “Even Ariel didn’t act like that.” “Did I not? Well… Seong Jihan… May I retreat now?” The Shadow Queen, who ventured outside with chains clanking around her, now wanted to return inside. As they conversed, a message from Octane arrived. [Seong Jihan. Is that the Shadow Queen?] “Why?” […So she is. I heard she was captured by the World Tree Alliance and thought I lost my investment!] Seong Jihan didn’t deny, and Octane quickly identified her identity. [Queen… I’m relieved to see you’re alive. Hehe. Then you can repay your investment, right?] “Queen, huh, the delusion is too much. I’m not the queen, just a mere shadow avatar of the queen. And even if she was alive, how would you repay a failed investment?” [You can pay with your body. Serve as a mercenary for our Investments firm. A 1000 years should cover the debt.] “Ah, right. There was something the queen mentioned before. She pledged her planet as collateral. Why not execute that?” [How could we take over a planet seized by the World Tree Alliance?] “That’s for the investor to figure out.” Octane pressuring the debt, and the queen attempting to wriggle out. -Alien species also ditch debts and abscond… -Who’s the bad one here? -Isn’t it obvious? Has to be the World Tree Elves LOL -LOL -When in doubt, the bad guy is always the World Tree Alliance LOL As Seong Jihan watched their bickering, he clapped his hands. “You two sort out your issues later. That’s it for the broadcast.” [Seong Jihan… Hand her over to me, and I’ll give you 1 trillion GP. The Shadow Queen would be useful as a mercenary… Yeah. I’ll even share the profits.] The proposal from the Ceo of Octane Investments to offer 1 trillion GP and even profits. Seong Jihan turned towards the Shadow Queen. “What do you think? Wanna go?” “Master! Please! You know I’m not the queen!” [Pleeeaaase.Seong Jihan. Anywhere but there!!] The Shadow Queen, cried out ‘Master’ aloud while internally screaming to Seong Jihan. She really didn’t want to be associated with Octane Investments. Seeing her decidedly appalled reaction, Seong Jihan chuckled. “Sorry, but she’s my sword. I’ll keep her.” [A sword? I can provide you with better equipment. So hand her over.] “Nothing less than EX grade.” [EX? Too greedy… SSS grade weapons can be swapped. So think it over and let me know.] Seong Jihan put Octane off for now but Octane left an opening till the very end. “Well, everyone. See you next time.” Beep! As the broadcast ended, the Shadow Queen immediately sighed in relief. “Phew… That was close. I never expected him to pop up. If you had handed me over, I’d have become a slave to Octane Investments.” “Is it that bad to be affiliated with them?” “If you get dragged there, there’s hardly any mercenary surviving for a hundred years.” “A hundred years is quite a long life.” “…Are you serious?” Gazing at Seong Jihan, the Shadow Queen rolled her eyes. “I intended to assist by writing a post on the official forum… But it seems impossible. If the name of the Shadow Queen becomes exposed again, those investor CEOs like Octane would swarm me to press the debt.” “How much debt did you rack up?” “Just for rising to Dominion level 8, I made some large investments… and it all turned to smoke thanks to the World Tree Alliance.” Grinding her teeth, the Shadow Queen made a suggestion to Seong Jihan. “Maybe you write a post on the official forum. Most will think it’s just an advertisement for the lowest rank race and ignore it, but if you certify the VIP card, it should help.” “Will it be more effective if a certified person does it?” “Certainly. Especially if you’re of Constellation origin. There’ll even be a Constellation certification mark beside your ID.” “Hmm…” Pondering upon her words, Seong Jihan fell into deep thought. ‘It’d be more beneficial for a Constellation to write it than me doing it myself…' And right then, Among his subscriber list was someone perfect for such a request. Chapter 329 Seong Jihan’s BattleTube channel. There, scenes of unilateral massacre were being broadcasted. Whooooosh! [What’s happening?] [Is this… Dragon Breath?] After reaching the Master League, Seong Jihan was only matched against alien species. The game began, and immediately, a massive fire was unleashed from the sky. With such one-sided attacks from a distance, the game ended quickly. The viewers released comments as they watched. -Wow, it’s over already? I just took a brief trip to the bathroom after the alarm and it’s finished -You see the big one? That’s why I watch it on my phone even when I’m doing my business -Lately, a general matchmaking game lasts at most 10 minutes LOL Following his battle with Constellation Longinus in Gangnam, Seoul, Seong Jihan had been matching in BattleNet general games for about a week. By the matchmaking system, the highly-rated him was matched with strong players even in the Master League, but… The results were always a complete victory for Seong Jihan. -Against aliens, who could match Seong Jihan? He even defeated a Constellation. -Really? Is that true? -Yes, the Sword King himself said there was a Constellation descent in Gangnam. -Having defeated a Constellation, the others are just guaranteed defeats LOL -Oh, the screen is dimming. -It’s ending already… ㅠㅠ Before the viewers’ conversation could develop further, the game concluded, closing the channel. Games in recent weeks always ended this way, leaving viewers craving more. Meanwhile, ‘It ended so quickly, but I still leveled up.’ Seong Jihan, exiting the game, checked his growth. Normally, reaching the Master League should have meant that leveling up would substantially slow down. However, perhaps due to all kinds of buffs overlapping since acquiring the VIP membership, Seong Jihan’s growth rate remained significantly fast. ‘Level 360…’ Seong Jihan reviewed his stats on the status window. Name: Seong Jihan Level: 360 Affiliation: Master League - Space 3 Martial Soul: 299 Void: 150 Red: 17 Eternity (Imperfect): 2 The considerable growth in his stats. Yet, Seong Jihan frowned upon seeing them. ‘Martial Soul isn’t moving up from 299.’ Martial Soul, which had been increasing independently without the need to invest remaining stat points, had stopped growing upon reaching 299, remaining unmoved. Since he is unable to invest the remaining points, he has no choice but to leave it alone for now. ‘I shouldn’t increase Void right now.’ The stat Void, in a sense, was the easiest to raise. The Arena’s Master hadn’t taken back the half-mask, the Void Processing Facility; just wearing it on the face steadily increased stats. However, this stat shouldn’t surpass its limit. Originally 200, this limit had substantially increased through the VIP membership, but… ‘Still, there was no exact figure on how much the accommodation had extended.’ Moreover, the VIP membership would be reclaimed after 6 months. Before finding a significant way to increase the void accommodation, it was crucial not to invest in this ability. ‘The stat Eternity hasn’t budged.’ The imperfect stat, Eternity. Since it first rose to 2, it showed no signs of growth. Eternity 2 allowed for the infinite extraction of the essence of life, a game-breaking ability. Yet, as beneficial as it was, points couldn’t be invested in it, and the trait showed no intent to increase. ‘Among the 4 stats, the only practically upgradable ability was red.’ With Martial Soul ceasing to increase, the only option left from the remaining points was red. Seong Jihan poured all his accumulated remaining points into red, raising it to 17. Certainly, focusing his investment made the power of fire more formidable, and coding became easier, but… Even then, Seong Jihan was not satisfied. ‘I need to break through the wall of Martial Soul at 299…’ Rejecting the Arena’s Master’s offer and confronting the entity that detained his sister Seong Jiah in the Abyss. To fight against him, possessing the strength of a high-level Constellation, more strength was necessary. But currently, only Red was upgradable. He had to puncture through the Martial Soul limit, which had hit a wall. ‘I need to delve further into the Annihilation Techniques.’ Martial Soul increased as he mastered the Annihilation Technique. The very first Annihilation Technique, Iron Blood Cross, was nearly fully analyzed after acquiring Longinus’s spear. From the second technique, Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods onwards, even though he had managed some adaptations, it was hard to claim full mastery. Moreover, ‘The utilization of the Third Annihilation Technique, Return of the Light, remains vague.’ Return of the Light, an annihilation technique related to fire. This granted the brief resurgence of power before death, it felt misaligned with the concept of an annihilation technique. Plus, the activation condition was unclear, whether it needed to be on the verge of death. Since remembering its name, Seong Jihan hadn’t grasped the technique’s utilization. ‘Ascending from the Master League won’t be tough, but challenging the Abyss Master would be impossible without continuous growth. I need to break the Martial Soul 299 barrier.’ Seong Jihan pondered upon the Martial Soul stuck at 299 when. Knock knock. “Come in.” “Boss… it’s me.” Lee Hayeon entered as the game concluded. * * * Lee Hayeon’s condition was visibly poor upon entry. Dark circles under her eyes from a week earlier, her face seemed thinner, yet her gaze remained intensely sharp. “Hayeon, haven’t you been sleeping?” “Yes. Discovering the BattleTube channel for aliens through Jihan’s account was like finding a new world…” “Yawn. Really, there’s all sorts of stuff there…” Following Lee Hayeon, Yoon Seah also entered, appearing tired but not as visibly affected due to being a high-level player. “I recently watched ‘A proposal to escape from BattleNet’s relegation zone with just 10 million GP. Testing if it’s true.’” “That proposal. Was it real?” “No. The portal was leading to a World Tree Elves lab after all.” World Tree Elves. They’d gone that far? “What’s scarier was a reply left under the video by a World Tree Alliance Elf saying, ‘We cannot overlook the malicious defamation of the Alliance’s honor.’” “Why’s that?” “An alien who used to upload one or two videos a week on his channel hasn’t uploaded anything in 100 years since this comment was posted.” Silenced, then? The influence of the World Tree Elves was indeed significant. ------------------ <strong>HEL SCANS</strong> [Translator - Asura] [Proofreader - Gun] Join our Discord for release updates! https://discord.com/invite/dbdMDhzWa2 ------------------ “I wanted to see more because there was so much other interesting content, but Hayeon said we should focus first.” “Right, our priority now is boosting Jihan’s subscribers.” Lee Hayeon sighed deeply. “Initially, when I browsed the alien BattleTube channels using Jihan’s account, boosting subscribers didn’t seem overly difficult. The cosmos is filled with Constellations, strong players, yes, but cases like Jihan’s, not even a Constellation yet defeating one, were extremely rare. There seemed to be plenty of content to work with. But… there was a deadly flaw in BattleTube.” “What flaw?” “… BattleTube has severe racial discrimination.” “Racial discrimination?” Confused, Seong Jihan listened as Lee Hayeon elaborated. “Species interacting with BattleNet across the cosmos typically rank at least medium… These species hardly acknowledge lower and lowest rankings as equals. They don’t bother to seek out their content. So, I thoroughly browsed channels run by lower and lowest ranking species. Subscribers really don’t increase.” “Is that so?” “Yes. And even if you watch, it’s somewhat self-deprecating content? Like a lowest rank race demeaning themselves. Giving off a vibe like ‘indeed a lowly race…’” “You know it well.” Lee Hayeon’s analysis prompted the Shadow Queen to emerge from Seong Jihan’s arm. “Not anyone can browse the alien BattleTube. It requires being at a level to interact with alien races as a player. And those who reach such a level are at least medium or above… They’ve climbed by stepping on lower ranks. To them, lower rankings are fundamentally objects of contempt.” “Is that so? Then isn’t it strange that I, being the lowest rank, have around 100 subscribers?” “That makes sense… Initially, I hadn’t paid much attention to the number, but for someone from the lowest rank to gather around 100 subscribers is indeed peculiar.” BattleTube’s alien viewers, disregarding the lowest ranks. Capturing their attention would not be easy through ordinary means. “Moreover, with the diversity in species and differing ecosystems, interests vary… It’s even harder to capture the attention of outsiders with the limitation of being ‘lowest ranking’.” “That’s true.” “However, there is one interest that binds all these players together.” Lee Hayeon gestured a circle with her fingers. “GP.” “No matter how high you climb, GP seems always scarce. Videos related to GP are wildly popular.” “Even in higher leagues, the amount of GP required for revival increases. Plus, maps with strange penalties ask for ten times the GP for revival, so if you’re unlucky, you could die in game. GP is practically a lifeline in BattleNet.” Even in higher leagues, the necessity for GP grows, as Shadow Queen elaborated. To races from diverse ecosystems, the common interest was how to earn GP. “So, I had an idea…” “What is it?” “The Space Arena!” Lee Hayeon’s eyes sparkled. “You’ve participated in games there before, right? It’s a cosmos-wide betting ground for all sorts of games!” “Unnie almost quit gambling, but after searching for arena-related info, her eyes changed…” “I stopped! This time, I had no choice but to conduct research for the sake of the boss’s subscribers!” Yoon Seah shook her head in disagreement, prompting Lee Hayeon to swiftly counter. “This month’s end, there’s a game for Master League players in the arena. If the boss participates and wins consecutively as someone from the lowest rank, those scouring for players to bet on will start noticing him.” “The Space Arena… Where the bet-obsessed ultimately gather. Standing out there will inevitably attract attention, whether you like it or not. The structure of the arena, however, makes it difficult to keep winning streaks…” “Why?\\" “If you keep winning, the arena matches you with stronger opponents. But the jump in difficulty is so high that most topple after around 5 consecutive wins.” Hearing this, Seong Jihan tilted his head. When he joined the Space Arena as a game map. He had easily strung together consecutive wins. So, he encountered the concealed being, ‘Remnant of the incarnation,’ and absorbed its power. ‘Was it just easy because it was a game map?’ Thinking this, Seong Jihan asked the Shadow Queen. “Do they give experience points in the arena?” “Thinking of leveling up? The experience rewards will be substantial. Still, the penalty for losing is high… If you’re not fully prepared, your level could plummet.” “That’s fine.” If he were defeated in the arena and lost levels, how would he face the formidable foes he’d meet in the future? Seong Jihan focused more on the victory rewards than the defeat penalties. “Let’s participate in the arena. But just participating might not draw enough attention.” “How about mixing it with a high self-bet? The focus intensifies if the player himself places the bet. At first, no one may notice, but as you start winning in the arena, the high self-bet is revealed, increasing the frequency of mentions. ‘Did you see the new player? Bet a huge amount on himself.’ Something like that. And there’s more…” Lee Hayeon, passionately pouring out strategies to draw attention, was brimming with ideas, her exhaustion transforming into vigor. Even if she quit gambling, her interest in betting seemed undiminished. “Shouldn’t we upload the previous arena win as a video beforehand? To show that I dominated in the arena mission too.” “Hmm. Shall we start with that?” Accepting Yoon Seah’s suggestion, they organized past videos for upload. [A subscriber ‘CEO Octane Investments’ donates 1,000,000GP with a message.] [It is an extraterrestrial being. Do you accept the sponsorship?] “…Is this that octopus from before?” One of the hundred or so subscribers had quickly sent a donation. Chapter 328 “Sponsorship, huh? As a Constellation, you wish to sponsor me?” “It’s not exactly a Constellation sponsorship. Instead…” Swoosh. The Arena’s Master conjured something from the void. Sparkle! Unfurling his hand, a card shimmering with rainbow hues was revealed – an item that looked extraordinary at a glance. [That, that’s… a VIP Membership?] The Shadow Queen perched on Seong Jihan’s arm exclaimed in shock upon seeing it. ‘A VIP Membership?’ [Yes… It’s an item that’s a level above the Space League Premium Membership I’ve only seen around in BattleNet communities, never in person.] An item that surpasses the premium membership. Seong Jihan recalled the effects of his own premium membership. Basically, during the membership period, a 100% increase in experience and GP acquisition, along with the ‘Hideout’ feature concealing his information and a 30% chance of being excluded from the opposing team’s ban list. ‘But I’ve hardly ever felt the 30% ban exclusion, so it’s practically only those two features that were of any use.’ The Hideout feature had been handy for concealing his identity. However, ever since becoming Earth’s number one, its utility wasn’t as significant as before, with the membership becoming less useful. Seong Jihan skeptically addressed the Shadow Queen. ‘It’s just a membership card, is it really worth getting this excited about?’ [Ha. “Just a membership card” you say! This is an item even the high-level Constellations struggle to obtain. Everyone desires it but nobody knows how to acquire it. And now, the Arena’s Master is offering it…] ‘Really? The premium membership has been less useful lately, anyway.’ [The VIP Membership is incomparable to the premium one.] As the Shadow Queen asserted, the Arena’s Master tightly gripped the card. Then, Swoosh… From the card shining with rainbow light, void energy emanated, swirling with violet smoke around it. “I’ll offer you this VIP Membership Card with ‘Void Authentication.’” “Void Authentication?” “Take a look.” As Seong Jihan received the card, the item description appeared. [Space League VIP Membership Card (Void Authenticated)] - Grade: EX - Certified by ‘The Owner of the Arena’ as a VIP membership card. - Holding this card increases the acquisition of experience and GP by 500%. - Enhanced ‘Spotlight’ and ‘Hideout’ features are applied to the player, allowing for a choice between them. - Holding this VIP membership includes a 50% chance of being excluded from the opposing team’s ban list. [Spotlight] - Announces the player’s premium membership across the BattleNet. It attracts the attention of many Constellations, allowing for sponsorship from across the cosmos. - Being a VIP member intensifies the effects. - Ads about the player will randomly appear on the Alien Species 0 channel, as the subscriber count of alien species on BattleTube is increased, it will boost cosmic fame and Constellation fame. - With BattleTube active, achieving a certain comprehensive viewer count activates the 'Star’ buff. The Star Buff intensifies as the comprehensive viewer count rises. ‘…The ability is strengthened based on the comprehensive viewer count?’ While Seong Jihan had skipped over the Spotlight feature when he had the premium membership, the Spotlight feature of the VIP membership was clearly not on the same level. Despite the downside of being globally recognized. Fame from notoriety, and a Star buff dependent on viewer count, were unique benefits only available to VIP members. Though the details were not specified, it was clear why the Shadow Queen was so astonished by the VIP Membership. ‘Then, the next feature is…’ Given the promise shown by Spotlight, Seong Jihan wondered about Hideout. Skimming the description for Hideout’s details revealed. [Hideout] - Conceals the player’s information under premium membership. It reduces attention from Constellations and makes it difficult for opposing teams to acquire the member’s information, prolonging the time to gain fame within BattleNet. - The VIP member status enhances its effects. - Players are removed from racial rankings and have a 100% chance to avoid bans. During the VIP membership, any mention of the player within the BattleNet community will be automatically deleted. Only admins can observe you. ‘Spotlight seems more appealing compared to this.’ Despite its upgrade, Hideout, aimed at concealing oneself, seemed less impressive, even with VIP enhancement. While the guaranteed ban avoidance was profoundly effective, it didn’t specifically bolster Seong Jihan’s strength. ‘Choosing Hideout would ensure ranking first among humans…’ Since Seong Jihan had already dominated the World Tree Elves’ competitors. Being free from bans would enable him to win every remaining game. But Seong Jihan’s adversaries were not limited to the Space League species. ‘With Longinus dead, who knows what Constellation from Tuseong will come next. To free my sister from The Abyss Master, I must increase my strength without fail.’ If he had to choose between the two, it’d be Spotlight this time. Seong Jihan then noticed the purple text added at the bottom of the item description window. [Void Authentication] - Received the Void Authentication from ‘The Owner of the Arena.’ - The capacity to accommodate the void significantly increases, allowing for one refusal against being bound by the void’s will. - Access to the Space Arena is granted for free. - The authentication effect lasts for 6 months, requiring re-certification by a Great Constellation to renew the VIP membership effects. The Arena’s Master truly was a Great Constellation. Realizing this from the last line, Seong Jihan inquired. “So the 6-month authentication applies to the entire VIP membership effects?” “That’s correct. Without re-certification, the VIP Membership will expire.” “I see…” “This time, I’m offering the VIP card merely as sponsorship. For re-certification, I’ll be asking for a nominal fee.” The Arena’s Master pointed at half of his face, tapping it while hinting at what he wanted. “You’re asking for the Void Processing Facility?” “Yes. The VIP Membership Extension and the Void Processing Facility… it’s a fair trade. Next renewal, I will claim the Code Medium.” Planning to obtain what he couldn’t recover this time through the VIP Membership. Seong Jihan grinned, storing the VIP Membership in his inventory. “I’ll consider that when the time comes.” “I look forward to a wise decision. Then.” Pop! The Arena’s Master snapped his fingers, closing the portal connected to the Abyss. And his body gradually became translucent. “It’s been a lengthy inconvenience. I should take my leave.” “Such inconveniences are always welcome.” “Ah, one last piece of advice before I go. Prepare thoroughly before challenging the Abyss Master. The one who has bound the Witch of the Void possesses the strength of a high-level Constellation.” “high-level, huh…” “Make good use of the VIP Membership.” With those parting words, the Arena’s Master exited the training ground. ‘This acquisition is quite significant.’ Acquiring the Spear of the Blood Clan and remembering the Third Annihilation Technique - Returning Light from defeating Longinus, plus the VIP Membership given by the Arena’s Master. The rewards for toppling a Constellation were sweet indeed. However, ------------------ <strong>HEL SCANS</strong> [Translator - Asura] [Proofreader - Gun] Join our Discord for release updates! https://discord.com/invite/dbdMDhzWa2 ------------------ ‘The Abyss Master… Why such an obsession with my sister? And specifically targeting me is also mysterious.’ The existence of the Abyss, strongly binding his sister, Seong Jiah, and his undecipherable motives left Seong Jihan perplexed. “How strong would a high-level Constellation be?” [At my peak of Lv.7 Dominion, I was barely high-level.] “So high-level starts from Constellation level 7.” [Yes. However, I couldn’t resist 999 times against the Arena’s Master. He’s either stronger or has a special method.] By that measure, the opponent seemed far stronger than Longinus, whom he recently faced. Seong Jihan frowned. “Was the Abyss Master always this strong?” [While some Constellations occasionally take charge of the Abyss, none have been high-level. This opponent is just unique.] “Hmm…” [As the Arena’s Master said, even with full preparation, it won’t be easy.] Seong Jihan nodded at the Shadow Queen’s reminder. Had it not been for Enkidu’s crucial involvement, subduing Longinus would have been challenging. Facing a high-level Constellation, with his current strength, would be even more difficult. To challenge him, “It seems I’ll need to activate Spotlight.” Seong Jihan decided to activate Spotlight for the VIP Membership. [Spotlight has been activated.] [Hideout has been deactivated.] And then, “…” Despite changing the settings, there seemed to be no significant change for Seong Jihan. * * * Days after acquiring the membership, Seong Jihan opened his BattleTube channel. His channel now separately displayed the subscriber count for alien species. Seong Jihan’s alien subscriber count was around 100. “Are the ads on Channel 0 working? The subscriber count isn’t rising much.” [Your human race subscribers are incredibly numerous.] “But those don’t count much towards the overall viewer rating.” [It’s a pity. Had the Shadow Elves been alive, I’d have forced them to subscribe to your channel.] “Then you subscribe.” [Hm…] Shortly after, the subscriber count for alien species on Seong Jihan’s channel increased by one. ‘You didn’t subscribe until now.’ Lacking sense despite owing him. As Seong Jihan gazed at his arm, The Shadow Queen defensively explained, [Your BattleTube content is too sparse. I thought you weren’t interested in managing it.] “Content? My videos are plentiful.” [Videos of the lowest species fighting amongst themselves, with one annihilating several, are hardly attractive. Imagine ants fighting, and one ant slaughters them all.] “That sounds interesting, though.” [Sorry, but the universe is full of that.] Seong Jihan furrowed his brow. There’s no meaning in activating Spotlight like this. Moreover, [The World Tree Yggdrasil wants to sponsor player Seong Jihan.] As soon as Seong Jihan disabled Hideout, Yggdrasil from the World Tree Alliance relentlessly messaged him. [The World Tree Yggdrasil offers Seong Jihan candidacy for Constellation in exchange for significant rewards.] [The World Tree Yggdrasil inquires if Seong Jihan is interested in joining the World Tree’s race.] [The World Tree Yggdrasil…] Spammed messages from him felt like receiving junk mail. “Ah, this guy is so annoying.” [Player Seong Jihan has blocked The World Tree Yggdrasil.] Seong Jihan utilized the block feature, available only for message spammers, on Yggdrasil. “Who’s that?” “It’s Yggdrasil.” [You’re something else. Blocking Yggdrasil…] “Why am I attracting such pests?” [Tell the World Tree Elves to subscribe to your channel.] “They said they would do it if I accepted sponsorship.” […] Yggdrasil’s obsession with Seong Jihan seemed profound. He seemed determined to sponsor Seong Jihan, which certainly didn’t feel like anything to accept. Then, “Boss~ I’ve brought the documents for players without Constellations. Oh… Are you checking your channel?” Guild Master Lee Hayeon brought documents to Seong Jihan, blinking in surprise. “Yes. The subscriber count isn’t growing.” “…What? You mean your subscriber count isn’t growing? Haven’t you surpassed 100 million a while ago?” “Not humans. Alien subscribers.” “Oh.” Lee Hayeon nodded in understanding at that response. “Now you have 104 subscribers… Even being Earth’s number one, it seems insufficient.” “It doesn’t satisfy me. I need to gather more, but there’s no way.” “Hmm… Gaining alien subscribers? How do other aliens gather subscribers anyway? Doing something similar could help.” Lee Hayeon said this while turning on her own BattleTube. “My BattleTube doesn’t show alien videos.” “Really? Mine does.” “Ah… Yours does? Shall we take a look for reference?” At Hayeon’s suggestion, Seong Jihan nodded and went to the BattleTube main screen. There, numerous viral videos uploaded by alien species were listed. “Ah…” Swoosh! Swoosh! \\"Oh, I can't seem to touch the screen. Boss. Can you skip to the next one?\\" \\"Sure.\\" Lee Hayeon flipped through the videos one by one, examining the topics of the popular videos with an eagle eye. Then, “Ah… it seems aliens aren’t much different.” Lee Hayeon grinned, proposing a solution. “Boss, I think I have a good idea.” Next, here is the current text to translate: Chapter 331: <2레벨로 회귀한 무신 331화> [오오. 머리야! 머리가 먼저 연락하다니, 이게 웬일이니?] 성지한이 연락을 한 대상은, 죽은 별의 성좌 칼레인이었다. 후원받는 입장인 플레이어는 성좌에게 먼저 연락할 수 없었기에. 성지한은 자신을 구독한 칼레인의 채널을 역으로 따라가 보았다. [고통 VS 환희. 대상에게 죽음의 기운을 더 뽑아내는 방법은?] [종족별 효과적인 고문법 – 용족 편] [최강의 언데드를 만들기 위해, 신족을 납치해 보았습니다.] 그로테스크한 영상이 가득한 죽은 별의 채널. “윽…… 이거 배틀튜브가 아니었다면 죄다 모자이크 처리해야 할 거 같은데.” “오너님. 저는 잠깐 자러 가도 될까요…….” “네네. 쉬고 계세요.” 배틀넷 때문에 잔인한 장면에도 어느 정도 내성이 생긴 윤세아나 이하연도, 죽은 별의 성좌가 올린 영상은 끝까지 보질 못했다. 잔인할 뿐만 아니라, 소름 끼치도록 집요하게 실험을 하는 장면이. 인간으로서 본능적인 거부감을 느끼게 한 것이다. 그래도, 네크로맨서 계열이라면 혹할 만한 정보가 많아서 그런지. ‘구독자가 백만이 넘네.’ 칼레인의 채널은, 적잖은 구독자 숫자를 자랑했다. 그렇게 성지한이 채널 구경을 하고 있자니, 칼레인이 추가로 메시지를 보냈다. [너 그러고 보니, 배릍튜브 시작했던데…….] “어. 그거 때문에 연락했어. 정식회원 게시판에 글 하나만 써 줄 수 있나? VIP 카드 인증 관련해서.” [에이. 겨우 정식회원 게시판에 글 하나 쓰고 만족하게? 내 머리가 되어 준다면, 합방도 가능한데. 어때어때? 내가 띄워 줄게!] “네 머리가 되면, 한 존재로 융합되는 거 아닌가? 그럼 내 채널이고 뭐고 사라질 텐데?” [아냐! 안 그럴 수도 있어~ 네가 주체로 변해서 죽은 별의 성좌가 사라지고 강력한 성지한으로 뒤바뀔지 누가 알아! 하자하자!] “됐다.” [아. 알았어. 그럼 임시체험은 어때! 내 머리로, 딱 10일만 있어 보는 거야! 10일 후에는 확실하게 분리해 줄게!] “됐다고.” 뭘 믿고 임시체험이야. 성지한의 단호한 거절에, 칼레인은 아쉬움을 드러넀다. [쳇…… 너무하네. 너 레벨 몇이야?] “370.” [아니, 내 부캐는 300도 안 됐는데…… 뭐 그리 빨리 올라? 이러다 금방 성좌 되겠네.] “네가 부캐에 진심이 아닌가 보지.” [무슨 소리. 대부분의 게임에서 1등을 도맡아 한다고! 300 이후 지옥의 레벨 업 구간을 초고속으로 돌파하네…… 야. 너 성좌 되면, 나랑 합체 못 해!] “그래? 그거 반가운 소식이군.” [으…… 머리가 성좌 돼서 머리 될 가능성이 사라지면, 도와주는 의미가 없는데 말이야.] 그건 그렇지. 죽은 별의 성좌가 성지한에게 호의를 보이는 건, 어디까지나 그가 ‘머리’가 될 최적화된 대상이었기 때문. 성지한이 머리를 거절하고 성좌로 한 단계 더 올라선다면, 칼레인으로서는 성지한을 지원할 이유가 없게 된다. [아무래도 글 쓰는 대가를 받아야겠어. 너, 성좌 연구소에서 얻은 유리병…… 하나만 내게 넘겨줘. 재생제 말고 딴 거!] “그건 어떻게 알았냐?” [흐흐. 우리 머리가 뭐 하는지, 성좌로서 다 지켜보고 있지!] 스토커냐? 성지한은 후원 성좌 끊어 버려야 하나 고민하면서, 인벤토리에서 저번에 얻었던 유리병들을 꺼냈다. ‘재생제를 제외한 다른 것들은, 아직 정확히 뭘 하는지 밝혀내질 못했지.’ 생명의 기운과, 여러 기운이 뒤섞여 있는 유리병 속 내용물. 성지한은 이들 중 몇 개는 직접 먹어 보기도 하고, 몇 개는 내부의 기운을 면밀히 살펴보았지만. 유리병 안 내용물을 먹었을 때, 그의 내부에 위치한 영원의 힘이 살짝 늘어난 것만 감지했을 뿐. 유의미한 결과는 얻어 내질 못했다. ‘이 중에 생명의 기운이 가장 약한 걸 하나 줘야겠네.’ 성지한은 그렇게 회수한 유리병 중에서, 가장 품질이 낮은 물건을 골랐다. “어떻게 전송하냐?” [오. 진짜 주는 거야? 잠깐만……!] 그렇게 칼레인에게서 메시지가 끊겼나 싶더니. 성지한의 눈앞에, 새로운 창이 떠올랐다. [후원 성좌 ‘죽은 별의 성좌’가 공물을 요구합니다.] [아이템을 올려 주십시오.] 메시지가 끝나고, 눈앞에서 일렁이는 검은색의 운무. 성지한은 게다가 유리병을 집어넣었다. 그러자, 검은 기운이 사라지며, 칼레인에게서 메시지가 도착했다. [오오……! 야. 이거 쓸 만한데? 이야. 너, 좋은 거 줬구나!] “그래? 뭐가 쓸 만한지 몰라서, 그냥 하나 넘긴 건데. 근데 그거 뭐에 쓰는 거야?” 천연덕스럽게 거짓말을 한 성지한은, 이렇게 된 거 유리병의 쓸모에 대해 물어보았다. [흐흐…… 아마도 이거, 정제된 세계수의 기운일 거야. 생명력의 최대 한도를 늘려 주는 역할을 하겠지.] “생명력을 늘려 준다라. 세계수의 열매도 비슷한 작용을 했던 것 같은데.” [그건 일반 플레이어들이 느끼는 효능이고. 이건 성좌급에게도 적용할 만큼, 기운이 잘 정제된 거지.] “순도가 더 높다?” [응. 나도 다른 유리병을 보진 않아서, 모두가 그런 목적인진 모르겠지만 말이야.] 정제된 세계수의 기운이라. 그래서 이걸 먹고 영원의 힘이 늘어난 건가. ‘나중에 한번 날 잡고 싹 다 복용해야겠군.’ 어쩌면 2에 머물러 있는 스탯 영원을 1 올릴 수도 있겠어. 성지한이 그렇게 유리병을 써먹을 용도를 정했을 때. [게시판에 글 하나로 퉁 치기에는 네가 준 게 너무 상등품이네. 내가 관련 영상도 하나 올려줄게!] “호오. 그래? 고맙군.” 유리병 속 내용물에 매우 만족한 칼레인이, 영상까지 하나 올려 주겠다고 이야기했다. [그러니 빨리 아레나에 참여부터 해. 그거와 연관해서 영상 올릴 거니까.] “알았다.” 어차피 구독자 숫자가 어떻게 되던, 레벨 업을 위해서라도 아레나는 참여할 생각이었으니까. 성지한은 그 자리에서, 바로 스페이스 아레나에 참가 신청을 했다. [스페이스 아레나에 참가하시겠습니까?] [스페이스 아레나의 루키입니다. 루키 혜택을 얻습니다.] [VIP 회원입니다. 아레나 참가비가 면제됩니다.] 루키 특전으로 30퍼센트 할인해서, 700억 GP에 달했던 아레나 참가비. 하나 VIP 회원은 이를 모두 면제받는 강력한 효과를 지니고 있었다. [마스터 리그 소속입니다.] [아레나 ‘마스터 – 1’에어리어에 소속됩니다.] [마스터 리그의 플레이어와 매칭됩니다…….] [경기가 매칭되었습니다.] [24시간 후 아레나로 소환됩니다.] ‘순식간이네.’ 아레나 참가 신청을 하자마자, 일사천리로 진행되는 게임 매칭. 성지한은 칼레인에게 이 사실을 알려 주었다. “했어. 24시간 후네.” [오. 그래? 어디 매칭되었어?] “마스터 – 1.” [마스터 1? 거기 부캐들 천진데…… 2에 소속되었으면 좋았을 텐데 아쉽네.] 칼레인은 그리 말하면서도. [좋아. 그럼 10조 GP 몰빵 영상 간다.] 성지한과의 약속을, 바로 이행했다. * * * 스페이스 아레나. 배틀넷에서 가장 GP가 많이 움직이는 장소 중 하나인 이곳은. 베팅에 실패하여 빈털터리가 된 이들이, 대박 건수를 찾아 망령처럼 배회하고 있었다. -어디 대박 건수 없나요? -행성 담보로 잡아서 GP 마지막으로 모아 왔습니다…… 어디 걸까요? 제발 저 좀 살려 주세요…… 이번에 실패하면 1억 동족 다 죽어요! └ 너 땜에 죽는 거잖아 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ 이런 놈도 군림 성좌라고 진짜 ㅡㅡ; 아레나가 열릴 때만 되면, 정식회원 게시판에서 종종 보이는 베팅 관련 글. 이런 이들에게 요즘 화제가 된 건, 죽은 별의 성좌가 올린 글이었다. VIP 회원권을 지닌, 최하급 종족 선수. 그의 놀라운 재능을 보면 연승이 예상된다면서, 베팅을 추천한다는 내용과 함께. 성지한에게 10조를 베팅하는 영상까지 첨부되어 있었다. 그리고 이 글에, 즉각적으로 반응하는 정식 회원들. [데스스타님이 플레이어 추천한 글 보셨나요?] 최하급 종족을 추천하셨던데, 영상에서도 10조 GP 다 거셨더라구요. 이 플레이어, VIP 회원권도 가지고 있고 나름 한 가닥 하는 거 같긴 한데. 아무리 그래도 최하급이라 좀……. 회원님들은 베팅할 만 해 보이시나요, 이 선수? └데스스타님이 투자했다길래, 구독해서 잠깐 둘러봤는데 그냥 최하급에서 잘나가는 수준……. └최하급에 베팅하면 100퍼센트 돈 날림. 애초에 체급 차이는 극복하기가 힘들어요. 데스스타 그렇게 안 봤는데, 이번에 실망했습니다. └난 솔직히 이 선수 괜찮았음. 재능은 있어 보임. 근데 배정된 데가 마스터 –1이라 에러…… 여기 고위 성좌들 부캐 쫙 깔린 곳입니다. 베팅 난이도 최강이에요. └맞아. 수틀리면 갑자기 본캐 성좌 권능 가지고 오잖아. └재미로 10만 GP만 투자해 보려고. 생각해 보니 최하급에 베팅해 본 적이 한 번도 없어서 ㅋㅋㅋ 최하급이라는 한계 때문인지, VIP 회원권이 있음에도 대체적으로 좋지 않은 평가를 내리고 있었다. 그나마 고평가하는 쪽도, 그가 아레나의 마스터 – 1 에 배정된 이상 높은 성적을 거두지 못할 거란 예측이 우세했다. “최하급 종족 서러워서 살겠나.” 게시판의 반응을 둘러본 성지한이 피식 웃으며 말하자, 그림자여왕이 이에 화답했다. “뭐, 사실 최하급이 살아남는 경우가 없긴 하지. 스페이스 리그에선.” “정말 하나도 없냐?” “음…… 그럴 거다. 스페이스 리그에서 오래 살아남아 있을수록, 종족이 진화하게 되니까. 생존자들은 최하급에 머무르고 싶어도, 종족 진화 효과를 받아서 하급 중급으로 올라서지.” “아하.” “아레나의 특별 보상으로 진화 보너스가 종종 주어지니, 한번 노려 보는 게 좋을 거야. 성좌의 부캐들도 다 그거 노리고 참전하는 거거든.” 성지한은 그 말에 눈을 빛냈다. 아레나에 그런 보너스까지 있었어? ‘어디 한번, 하급으로 올라가 봐야겠군.’ 인류 종족이 성장하다 보면, 성지한 자신에게도 결국 +가 될 테니까. 성지한은 이왕 참가하는 김에, 아레나의 특별 보상까지 타 먹기로 마음먹었다. “오너님. 외계 구독자 숫자가 3천 명 돌파했어요! 그리고, 세계수 엘프와 전투했던 영상 위주로 외계 쪽 조회수가 급등하고 있어요. 아무래도 여기가 강적이라 그런가…… 이쪽 위주로 계속 편집 영상 올릴게요!” 성지한의 영상 대부분은 훑어보거나, 아예 재생도 하지 않는 외계 종족이었지만. 세계수 엘프와의 전투한 영상은, 꽤 조회수가 올라가 있었다. -최하급 출신치고는 마냥 약하진 않네? -고엘프도 제압했어? 조금만 베팅해 볼까? 그리고 몇 개 달리기 시작하는 외계 종족의 리플. “네. 최근 영상 위주로, 부탁 좀 드리죠.” 성지한은 영상 정리를 이하연에게 맡기고는. [아레나로 소환됩니다.] 아레나로 강제 소환되었다. [외계 종족에게 실시간 영상을 송출하겠습니까?] 배틀튜브를 틀자, 새로이 뜨는 메시지. 성지한이 예를 누르자, 채팅창이 두 개로 나뉘었다. -오, 아레나라니…… 이건 일반 게임이랑은 다른가 보네. -이번에는 10분 컷 안 당하겠죠? -모르지 1:1이면 오히려 금방 더 순삭당하는 거 아니에요? 성지한의 압승을 당연시하며, 너무 게임이 빨리 끝날까 불안해하는 지구인들과. -1억 동족 생명이 당신에게 걸려 있습니다. 1승, 1승만 하세요! 이기면 제가 특별히 후원도 쏘겠습니다! -1억 빌런 결국 최하급에 베팅했넼ㅋㅋㅋ -최하급 종족에게 몰빵하는 군림 성좌라니…… 당신의 별에 사는 종족이 불쌍하군요. -오히려 저 도박중독자가 별 빼앗기면, 좋은 주인 만나겠죠 ㅎ -실시간 영상으로 보니 인류란 종족, 더 볼품없네. 1경기도 못 이기겠어. 성지한의 실시간 영상을 시청하면서도, 회의적인 반응을 보이는 외계 종족들. ‘오. 그래도 외계 종족 시청자 수가 꽤 되네.’ 구독자는 비록 3천 명밖에 되지 않았지만. VIP 회원권을 지닌 성지한에게 베팅한 숫자가 적잖은지, 동시 시청자 숫자는 쭉쭉 모이더니 어느새 5천 명에 이르고 있었다. ‘흠…… 근데 5천이 넘어도 스타 버프는 안 생기네.’ 종합시청자 수치가 기준치를 돌파해야 활성화된다는 스타 버프. 하나 외계 종족을 꽤 끌어들였음에도, 스타 버프는 미동도 하지 않았다. 그리고. [상대를 매칭합니다…….] [‘삼두육비의 왕자’가 매칭됩니다.] 스으으으. 아레나 경기장의 건너편에 등장한 거대한 형체. 머리 셋, 손 여섯 개의 거인은 온몸을 감싼 갑주를 착용한 채, 성지한을 내려다보고 있었다. -삼두육비 왕자 아직도 여기 있어? -지긋지긋하다 성좌 부캐 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ -아아아아아아악 왜 저놈이 아아아아아아 내 행성 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 그가 나타나자 외계 채팅창의 반응은, 이미 졌다고 확정 짓는 분위기였다. 그리고 머리 셋의 거인은. “최하급…….” 성지한을 바라보더니, 갑옷과 무기를 스스로 해제했다. “너 같은 놈에겐 장비를 착용하기도 아깝구나.” 속옷만 입은 상태가 된 머리 셋 거인. 그는 성지한에게 천천히 다가가, 여섯 개의 손을 크게 펼쳤다. 파리 잡듯, 찍어 버리려는 가벼운 손길. 그래도 그 안에 담긴 힘은 확실히 만만치 않았다. 하지만. “갑옷 안 입길 잘했네.” 스으윽. 이클립스가 성지한의 손에서 피어오르자. “안 입어서 졌다고, 변명할 거리가 생겼잖아.” 촤아아악! 거인의 머리 셋이, 그대로 허공을 날았다. 그리고 떠오르는, 짤막한 메시지.

Players who receive sponsorships could not initiate contact with their Constellation sponsors, making this an unusual situation. Seong Jihan had looked back at the channel of Calain, who had subscribed to him. [Pain VS Joy. What's the best way to draw more of death's aura from a subject?] [Effective Torture Techniques by Species – Dragonkind Edition] [For the creation of the ultimate undead, we tried abducting a deity.] His channel, filled with grotesque videos, drew a strong reaction. “Ugh… If this wasn’t BattleTube, all of this would have to be censored.” “Owner, may I go rest for a while…?” “Sure, sure. Take your rest.” Even Lee Hayeon and Yoon Seah, who had developed some tolerance for brutal scenes due to BattleNet, found it difficult to watch the videos posted by the Constellation of the Dead Star to the end. The videos were not only brutal but chillingly meticulous in their experiments, eliciting a primal sense of rejection in any human. Nonetheless, given the wealth of information that would likely appeal to those interested in necromancer classes, ‘He has over a million subscribers.’ Calain’s channel boasted a considerable number of subscribers. While Seong Jihan was browsing through the channel, Calain sent an additional message. [You’ve started BattleTube, I see...] “Yeah. That’s why I contacted you. Can you write a post on the official forum for me? About VIP card certification.” [Hey. Is that all you want after contacting me? If you become my head, we can collaborate on something even bigger. How about it? I can give you a boost!] “If I became your head, wouldn’t we merge into one entity? Then what about my channel?” [No, it doesn't have to be that way~ You could take over and the Constellation of the Dead Star could vanish, leaving a powerful Seong Jihan behind. Who knows! Let’s do it!] “Forget it.” [Ah. Alright. Then, how about a trial period as my head? Just 10 days! I’ll make sure we’re separated definitively after 10 days!] “Forget I asked.” What was he thinking, offering a \\"trial period\\"? Despite Seong Jihan’s firm refusal, Calain displayed his disappointment. [Che… What a shame. What’s your level now?] “370.” [What? My alt character isn’t even at 300 yet... How did you level up so fast? You’ll become a Constellation in no time.] “It appears you’re not as committed to your alt.” [What are you talking about? I’m top-ranking in most games! But you... blasting through the hellish leveling phase after 300 so quickly… Hey. If you become a Constellation, we can’t merge!] “Is that so? That’s actually good news.” [Urgh… If my head becomes a Constellation, making my involvement pointless, then there’s no reason to help you.] That was indeed the case. The Constellation of the Dead Star’s favor towards Seong Jihan was based on the premise that he was the most optimized candidate to become his \\"head.\\" If Seong Jihan refused and ascended further as a Constellation, Calain would have no reason to support him. [Looks like I’ll need to be compensated for writing the post. That bottle you obtained from the Constellation Research Center… just hand me one of those. Not the regenerative one, something else!] “How did you know about that?” [Hehe. A Constellation keeps an eye on what his head is up to!] Was he stalking him? While Seong Jihan considered severing ties with the sponsoring Constellation, he pulled out the bottles he had acquired from his inventory. ‘Aside from the regenerative one, the others’ exact functions are still unknown.’ The bottles, filled with life essence and various energies. Seong Jihan had tried consuming a few himself and closely examined the energies within others, but only sensed a slight increase in the power of Eternity within him, not achieving any meaningful results. ‘I should give him the one with the weakest life essence.’ Deciding thus, Seong Jihan picked out the lowest quality item from the bottles he had reclaimed. “How am I supposed to send it?” [Oh, you’re really giving it to me? Wait a moment…!] Following Calain’s brief cut-off, a new window appeared in front of Seong Jihan. [The sponsoring Constellation ‘Constellation of the Dead Star’ requests a tribute.] [Please place the item here.] After the message finished, a swirling black mist appeared before Seong Jihan. He placed the bottle into it, and as the black energy vanished, a message from Calain arrived. [Oh…! Hey, this is pretty useful! Wow, you actually gave me something good!] “Really? I didn’t know its use, so I just sent one over. But what is it used for?” Feigning ignorance, Seong Jihan asked about the bottle’s purpose, given the situation. [Hehe… This might well be refined World Tree energy. It likely serves to increase the maximum limit of vitality. ] “Increases vitality, huh. The fruit of the World Tree seemed to have a similar effect.” [That's the general effect felt by players. This one is refined well enough to apply even at the Constellation level.] “It’s of a higher purity?” [Yeah. I haven’t seen the other bottles, so I can’t say they all serve that purpose.] Refined World Tree energy, then. That explained why consuming it increased the power of Eternity. ‘I’ll have to set aside a day to consume them all.’ Perhaps this could even raise his Eternity stat from 2 to 3. As Seong Jihan decided how to utilize the bottles, [Considering the quality of what you’ve given me, one post on the forum doesn’t seem enough. I’ll upload a related video too!] “Oh? Really? Thanks.” Pleased with the contents of the bottle, Calain decided to upload a video as well. [So, get started with the arena participation. I’ll upload a video related to that.] “Got it.” Seong Jihan had planned to participate in the arena anyway for the sake of leveling up, regardless of subscriber numbers. Right there, Seong Jihan promptly applied for entrance into the Space Arena. [Do you wish to participate in the Space Arena?] [You are a rookie in the Space Arena. You receive rookie benefits.] [You are a VIP member. The entry fee for the arena is waived.] The entry fee for the arena, normally discounted by 30% to 70 billion GP for rookies, was entirely waived for VIP members, demonstrating a powerful effect. [You are affiliated with the Master League.] [You are assigned to the 'Master - 1' area.] [Matching with players from the Master League…] [The match has been made.] [You will be summoned to the arena in 24 hours.] ‘That was quick.’ The game's matchmaking process progressed swiftly upon applying for the arena. Seong Jihan informed Calain of this development. “I’ve applied. The match is in 24 hours.” [Oh? Really? Which area were you matched in?] “Master – 1.” [Master 1? That place is full of alt characters… If you were in 2, that would've been better.] Calain commented thus but then, [Alright. Here goes a 10 trillion GP bet video.] He immediately fulfilled his promise made to Seong Jihan. * * * The Space Arena, one of BattleNet's venues where a significant amount of GP is wagered, was full of spirits akin to phantoms looking for a big win after facing devastating losses betting. -Is there any sure win available? -I've put up a planet as collateral and gathered all the GP I’ve got… Where should I bet? Please save me… If I fail this time, a hundred million of my kin will die! └ It’s because of you they’re dying lol └ Really, this guy’s a ruling Constellation? When the arena is about to open, posts about betting frequently appear on the official forum. The recent buzz among these folks was about a post Calain had made. A lowest-ranking species athlete with VIP membership, lauded for his tremendous talent and expected to win consecutive matches. The post, encouraging bets on him along with a video of Calain betting 10 trillion GP on him, caught everyone's attention. And immediately, official members began responding to the post. [Have you seen the post by DeathStar recommending a player?] He recommended a lowest-ranking species, and in the video, he bet 10 trillion GP on him. This player even has a VIP membership and seems fairly competent. But betting on the lowest-ranking species is a bit… What do you all think, members, is this player worth betting on? └ DeathStar invested, so I subscribed and checked it out, but he seems just above average for the lowest rank… └ Betting on the lowest rank is a guaranteed loss. You can't overcome the fundamental difference in class. Disappointed in DeathStar this time. └ I honestly found this player quite good. There’s potential. But being assigned to Master -1 is an error… that area's filled with high-ranking Constellations’ alt characters. Betting difficulty is at its highest. └ Exactly. If it goes wrong, they can bring in powers from their main Constellations. └ Just for fun, I’ll throw in 100,000 GP. Thinking about it, I’ve never bet on the lowest rank before lol Despite having a VIP membership, the overall reception was negative due to the inherent limitations of being the lowest-ranking species. Most who spoke favorably still doubted high achievements in 'Master - 1,' where he was placed. “Life’s tough as the lowest ranking.” Seong Jihan chuckled, browsing through the forum reactions, and the Shadow Queen responded. “Well, it’s true that the lowest rank has no survival record in the Space League.” “Not even one?” “Mmm… It’s likely. The longer you survive in the Space League, the more your species evolves. Survivors, even if they want to remain in the lowest rank, end up receiving race evolution effects, ascending to low or mid-rank.” “I see.” “Arena special rewards often include evolution bonuses, so it might be worth targeting. The Constellation’s alts participate for that reason too.” Seong Jihan’s eyes gleamed at that. There were such bonuses in the arena? ‘Let’s see if I can ascend to low-rank, then.’ If the human race evolved, it would ultimately be a plus for Seong Jihan himself. Intending to fully claim the arena's special rewards, Seong Jihan thought, “Owner. The alien subscriber count has surpassed 3,000! Also, videos of your battles against the World Tree Elves are experiencing a surge in views from alien sources. Seems like strong opposition is attracting more attention… I’ll continue uploading compilation videos focused on that!” Although the majority of alien species had either skimmed through or not played Seong Jihan’s videos at all, the ones showcasing battles against the World Tree Elves had noticeably high views. -For being from the lowest rank, he’s not entirely weak, huh? -He even subdued a high-elf? Maybe I should bet a little. And a few comments from alien species began to appear. “Yes. Please prioritize recent videos.” After delegating the video sorting to Lee Hayeon, [You will be summoned to the arena.] Seong Jihan was forcibly teleported to the arena. [Do you wish to broadcast the match live to alien species?] Upon turning on BattleTube, a new message popped up. Seong Jihan agreed, and the chat split into two. -Oh, it’s the arena… I guess it’s different from regular games. -Hopefully, it’s not over in 10 minutes this time? -Who knows, 1:1 might even end quicker, right? Earthlings, who considered Seong Jihan’s overwhelming victories a given, were anxious it might end too swiftly, while, -A hundred million lives of my species depend on you. Just win one, one game! If you win, I’ll sponsor you generously! -The 100-million villain actually bet on the lowest rank lol -A ruling Constellation betting all on the lowest rank... your planet's inhabitants are to be pitied. -If that gambling addict loses his planet, maybe they'll find a better ruler lol -A live broadcast makes the human race seem even less impressive. He won't win a single game. Even as they watched Seong Jihan’s live broadcast, alien species expressed skepticism. ‘Oh. The number of alien viewers is quite high.’ Even though subscribers were only about 3,000, Given the bets placed on VIP member Seong Jihan, the viewer count steadily climbed, soon reaching 5,000. ‘Hmm… but crossing 5,000 doesn’t trigger the Star Buff.’ The Star Buff, supposedly activated upon surpassing a viewer count threshold, remained inactive despite attracting a significant number of alien species. And then, [Matching opponent…] [‘Prince of Three Heads and Six Arms’ has been matched.] A giant figure appeared across the arena, with three heads and six arms, decked in full armor, staring down at Seong Jihan. -Is the Prince of Three Heads and Six Arms still here? -So sick of Constellation alts lol -Aaaaaah why him aaaaaah my planet ㅠㅠㅠ The alien chat’s reaction was resigned, considering the match already lost upon his appearance. Then, the three-headed giant, “Lowest rank…” Looking at Seong Jihan, he voluntarily removed his armor and weapons. \\"Against a creature like you, wearing equipment would be an insult.\\" Reduced to just his underwear, the three-headed giant approached Seong Jihan, spreading his six arms wide, as if to easily squash him. Despite the light gesture, the power behind it was undeniable. However, “Good thing you're not wearing armor.” As Eclipse flared in Seong Jihan’s hand, “Now you can say you lost because you weren't armored.” Swoosh! The giant's three heads soared through the air, separated from his body. And a brief message popped up, [Victor: Seong Jihan.] The first match ended in the blink of an eye."},{"instruction":"You will be translating a text while maintaining consistency with previously translated related texts. First, carefully read the previously translated texts to understand the context: Chapter 331 [Oh, Head! What a surprise to hear from you first. What brings this about?] The one Seong Jihan reached out to was Kalein, from the Constellation of the Dead Star.

However, “Good thing you’re not wearing armor.” As Eclipse flared in Seong Jihan’s hand, “Now you can say you lost because you weren’t armored.” Swoosh! The giant’s three heads soared through the air, separated from his body. And a brief message popped up, [Victor: Seong Jihan.] The first match ended in the blink of an eye. Chapter 330 The giant octopus race member, Octane, who proclaimed himself a legendary investor. He called Seong Jihan a blue chip and talked about making significant investments in him, but… ‘After realizing humans have no growth limit, he withdrew his share investment proposal and vanished.’ He mentioned BattleNet would not simply overlook someone with no growth limit, choosing to withdraw not just investments but also withholding information before disappearing. And now he’s showing up again… ‘Well, might as well accept it.’ Seong Jihan accepted the sponsorship. And then, [It’s been a while, blue chip. Well, now that your name is out… I’ll call you Seong Jihan.] “Do as you like.” [Seeing you upload that old arena video, are you finally starting activities?] “Starting activities… If it’s related to BattleTube, you could say that.” [Heh. I recognized your potential when you subdued me at the North Wall… Though I couldn’t make an equity investment due to complications. If you’re participating in the arena this time, you’ll be the season’s player with the highest returns.] Continuing, he said, [Especially being from the lowest rank actually appeals to investors… I recommended you to several groups who share investment values with me, but everyone disregarded investing in some lowest rank species. If only you were at least low rank, my recommendation would’ve already got you over a thousand subscribers. It shows how rare an interest in the lowest rank is…] “So it was your group who subscribed when I wasn’t even actively doing anything?” [No, around 50 from our side. The rest… I have no idea who subscribed…] “Hmm. Is that so?” Who are the remaining 50? Seong Jihan tried to check the subscribers through BattleTube settings, but, [Account is private.] Aside from a few, most accounts were private. ‘Among the open ones, some are from the Constellation of the Dead Star or the World Tree Elf line.‘ Constellation of the dead star who showed obsession towards Seong Jihan, or his eternal adversaries, the World Tree Elves. These were all subscribers in some way connected to Seong Jihan. Removing Octane’s acquaintance, practically no pure subscribers remained. ‘Would be strange to have subscribers without actually starting activities, anyway.’ So far, he had hidden his identity with Hideout, engaging only with human viewers on BattleTube. There was no need for extraterrestrial beings to bother subscribing here. Rather, excluding former connections, how the rest subscribed was nearly miraculous. Seong Jihan planned to steadily grow from here on, continuing his chat with Octane. “How do you increase subscribers?” [Why do you want to increase subscribers… Fame brings scrutiny. Being unnoticed as the lowest rank race is rather advantageous here. You can gamble on yourself for large amounts of GP…] “Right now, I need fame more than GP.” [Is that so. You’re being exposed on purpose… Have you chosen Spotlight over Hideout?] Quick to grasp the situation upon hearing Seong Jihan’s story, Octane continued, “Exactly. I just upgraded my membership, and Spotlight seems more beneficial.” [What? You upgraded your membership? Don’t tell me you got VIP…] “Yeah.” [I can hardly believe it. Can you record it and show me? Then, I’ll sponsor 10 million GP.] Octane, showing considerable interest in the VIP membership, offered more. “Live broadcast?” [Yes.] “Fine. Let’s start right now.” Thus, Seong Jihan immediately turned on BattleTube. * * * - Uh… the game ended a while ago? - Oh… it’s a penthouse! Is this a live broadcast? - This is that living room! Where Seong Jihan had his first broadcast! As soon as Seong Jihan started broadcasting following his game victory, viewers poured in. - Yoon Seah and Lee Hayeon are also there. - Why do they look like that? LOL - Especially Lee Hayeon… it was all makeup… The chat didn’t hesitate to comment on Lee Hayeon and Yoon Seah’s faces appearing on the screen. As the number of viewers surged instantly. More comments about Lee Hayeon, who looked considerably more tired, filled the chat. She read the chats on the spot and frowned. “Really, these people. It’s not because of makeup, okay? It’s because we’ve been staying up all night.” “Yeah. unnie and I have been up all night watching alien broadcasts with my uncle's account. There’s a lot of interesting stuff.” “Wow. We both stayed up, but only Seah looks unworried… That’s why being high-level is the best.” Despite staying up together, Lee Hayeon looked noticeably more affected than Yoon Seah, another testament to the difference between a supporting player and a regular player. “Here.” Seong Jihan slowly pulled out the membership card from his inventory. “What I’m broadcasting today is simple. Space League membership card verification.” The card itself shone with a rainbow hue, the VIP membership card. - Membership card? - Pretty card haha - Is that glow natural? - What’s so good about VIP? While viewers reacted lightly, seeing it as merely a fancy card, [Indeed… It was true. How did you acquire a VIP membership… one that even Constellations struggle to get?] Shocked by seeing the VIP card, [A subscriber ‘CEO Octane Investments’ donates 10,000,000GP.] He kept his promise. - ?? 10 million GP? - Isn’t that the previous octopus? - The scale of a universal big shot, insane Viewers who came to watch Seong Jihan’s broadcast were astounded to see such a huge amount of sponsorship from an extraterrestrial. [Don’t upload this video. Promise to delete it, and I’ll sponsor a hundred million GP.] Octane even offered a hundred million GP to have the video deleted. But, “No. This needs to be uploaded.” Seeing Octane’s reaction, Seong Jihan realized the impact of the VIP membership. […Then I’ll sponsor a billion.] “I’ll pass.” Despite Octane offering ten times more, Seong Jihan’s response was firm. - A billion? - This extraterrestrial big shot is nuts - Was the video of VIP authentication worth that much? - Exactly LOL. It’s just a pretty card LOL […So you desire fame that much?] “Right now, fame is more important to me than GP.” [If you expose yourself too much in the Space League, you’ll be targeted by strong figures. Especially someone irregular like you, many are waiting for an opportunity to strike.] “That’s okay. I’m a Constellation candidate right now, so I’m under protection.” After the candidacy ends, the Martial God's disciple would be more of a problem than the extraterrestrial strong ones. Already riding a tiger, Seong Jihan had to utilize any means to gather strength. [Huh… No choice then…] ------------------ <strong>HEL SCANS</strong> [Translator - Asura] [Proofreader - Gun] Join our Discord for release updates! https://discord.com/invite/dbdMDhzWa2 ------------------ Octane gave up on the deal after seeing Seong Jihan not giving in even if he tried to bid more than a billion GP. At that moment, Seong Jihan saw the Shadow Queen, who had been outside, come in. Unlike earlier, she was cowering in a corner of the living room. Approaching her, Seong Jihan inquired, “What do you think? Broadcasting widely that I’m a VIP during the protection period.” “A good approach, Seong Jihan. To boost subscribers, broadcasting that you’re a VIP would be effective.” The Shadow Queen suddenly spoke formally, using honorific language in response to Seong Jihan’s question. “…What's with the sudden change? It doesn’t suit you.” “What do you mean? I’m Ariel. I’ve always been like this, haven’t I?” “Even Ariel didn’t act like that.” “Did I not? Well… Seong Jihan… May I retreat now?” The Shadow Queen, who ventured outside with chains clanking around her, now wanted to return inside. As they conversed, a message from Octane arrived. [Seong Jihan. Is that the Shadow Queen?] “Why?” […So she is. I heard she was captured by the World Tree Alliance and thought I lost my investment!] Seong Jihan didn’t deny, and Octane quickly identified her identity. [Queen… I’m relieved to see you’re alive. Hehe. Then you can repay your investment, right?] “Queen, huh, the delusion is too much. I’m not the queen, just a mere shadow avatar of the queen. And even if she was alive, how would you repay a failed investment?” [You can pay with your body. Serve as a mercenary for our Investments firm. A 1000 years should cover the debt.] “Ah, right. There was something the queen mentioned before. She pledged her planet as collateral. Why not execute that?” [How could we take over a planet seized by the World Tree Alliance?] “That’s for the investor to figure out.” Octane pressuring the debt, and the queen attempting to wriggle out. -Alien species also ditch debts and abscond… -Who’s the bad one here? -Isn’t it obvious? Has to be the World Tree Elves LOL -LOL -When in doubt, the bad guy is always the World Tree Alliance LOL As Seong Jihan watched their bickering, he clapped his hands. “You two sort out your issues later. That’s it for the broadcast.” [Seong Jihan… Hand her over to me, and I’ll give you 1 trillion GP. The Shadow Queen would be useful as a mercenary… Yeah. I’ll even share the profits.] The proposal from the Ceo of Octane Investments to offer 1 trillion GP and even profits. Seong Jihan turned towards the Shadow Queen. “What do you think? Wanna go?” “Master! Please! You know I’m not the queen!” [Pleeeaaase.Seong Jihan. Anywhere but there!!] The Shadow Queen, cried out ‘Master’ aloud while internally screaming to Seong Jihan. She really didn’t want to be associated with Octane Investments. Seeing her decidedly appalled reaction, Seong Jihan chuckled. “Sorry, but she’s my sword. I’ll keep her.” [A sword? I can provide you with better equipment. So hand her over.] “Nothing less than EX grade.” [EX? Too greedy… SSS grade weapons can be swapped. So think it over and let me know.] Seong Jihan put Octane off for now but Octane left an opening till the very end. “Well, everyone. See you next time.” Beep! As the broadcast ended, the Shadow Queen immediately sighed in relief. “Phew… That was close. I never expected him to pop up. If you had handed me over, I’d have become a slave to Octane Investments.” “Is it that bad to be affiliated with them?” “If you get dragged there, there’s hardly any mercenary surviving for a hundred years.” “A hundred years is quite a long life.” “…Are you serious?” Gazing at Seong Jihan, the Shadow Queen rolled her eyes. “I intended to assist by writing a post on the official forum… But it seems impossible. If the name of the Shadow Queen becomes exposed again, those investor CEOs like Octane would swarm me to press the debt.” “How much debt did you rack up?” “Just for rising to Dominion level 8, I made some large investments… and it all turned to smoke thanks to the World Tree Alliance.” Grinding her teeth, the Shadow Queen made a suggestion to Seong Jihan. “Maybe you write a post on the official forum. Most will think it’s just an advertisement for the lowest rank race and ignore it, but if you certify the VIP card, it should help.” “Will it be more effective if a certified person does it?” “Certainly. Especially if you’re of Constellation origin. There’ll even be a Constellation certification mark beside your ID.” “Hmm…” Pondering upon her words, Seong Jihan fell into deep thought. ‘It’d be more beneficial for a Constellation to write it than me doing it myself…' And right then, Among his subscriber list was someone perfect for such a request. Chapter 329 Seong Jihan’s BattleTube channel. There, scenes of unilateral massacre were being broadcasted. Whooooosh! [What’s happening?] [Is this… Dragon Breath?] After reaching the Master League, Seong Jihan was only matched against alien species. The game began, and immediately, a massive fire was unleashed from the sky. With such one-sided attacks from a distance, the game ended quickly. The viewers released comments as they watched. -Wow, it’s over already? I just took a brief trip to the bathroom after the alarm and it’s finished -You see the big one? That’s why I watch it on my phone even when I’m doing my business -Lately, a general matchmaking game lasts at most 10 minutes LOL Following his battle with Constellation Longinus in Gangnam, Seoul, Seong Jihan had been matching in BattleNet general games for about a week. By the matchmaking system, the highly-rated him was matched with strong players even in the Master League, but… The results were always a complete victory for Seong Jihan. -Against aliens, who could match Seong Jihan? He even defeated a Constellation. -Really? Is that true? -Yes, the Sword King himself said there was a Constellation descent in Gangnam. -Having defeated a Constellation, the others are just guaranteed defeats LOL -Oh, the screen is dimming. -It’s ending already… ㅠㅠ Before the viewers’ conversation could develop further, the game concluded, closing the channel. Games in recent weeks always ended this way, leaving viewers craving more. Meanwhile, ‘It ended so quickly, but I still leveled up.’ Seong Jihan, exiting the game, checked his growth. Normally, reaching the Master League should have meant that leveling up would substantially slow down. However, perhaps due to all kinds of buffs overlapping since acquiring the VIP membership, Seong Jihan’s growth rate remained significantly fast. ‘Level 360…’ Seong Jihan reviewed his stats on the status window. Name: Seong Jihan Level: 360 Affiliation: Master League - Space 3 Martial Soul: 299 Void: 150 Red: 17 Eternity (Imperfect): 2 The considerable growth in his stats. Yet, Seong Jihan frowned upon seeing them. ‘Martial Soul isn’t moving up from 299.’ Martial Soul, which had been increasing independently without the need to invest remaining stat points, had stopped growing upon reaching 299, remaining unmoved. Since he is unable to invest the remaining points, he has no choice but to leave it alone for now. ‘I shouldn’t increase Void right now.’ The stat Void, in a sense, was the easiest to raise. The Arena’s Master hadn’t taken back the half-mask, the Void Processing Facility; just wearing it on the face steadily increased stats. However, this stat shouldn’t surpass its limit. Originally 200, this limit had substantially increased through the VIP membership, but… ‘Still, there was no exact figure on how much the accommodation had extended.’ Moreover, the VIP membership would be reclaimed after 6 months. Before finding a significant way to increase the void accommodation, it was crucial not to invest in this ability. ‘The stat Eternity hasn’t budged.’ The imperfect stat, Eternity. Since it first rose to 2, it showed no signs of growth. Eternity 2 allowed for the infinite extraction of the essence of life, a game-breaking ability. Yet, as beneficial as it was, points couldn’t be invested in it, and the trait showed no intent to increase. ‘Among the 4 stats, the only practically upgradable ability was red.’ With Martial Soul ceasing to increase, the only option left from the remaining points was red. Seong Jihan poured all his accumulated remaining points into red, raising it to 17. Certainly, focusing his investment made the power of fire more formidable, and coding became easier, but… Even then, Seong Jihan was not satisfied. ‘I need to break through the wall of Martial Soul at 299…’ Rejecting the Arena’s Master’s offer and confronting the entity that detained his sister Seong Jiah in the Abyss. To fight against him, possessing the strength of a high-level Constellation, more strength was necessary. But currently, only Red was upgradable. He had to puncture through the Martial Soul limit, which had hit a wall. ‘I need to delve further into the Annihilation Techniques.’ Martial Soul increased as he mastered the Annihilation Technique. The very first Annihilation Technique, Iron Blood Cross, was nearly fully analyzed after acquiring Longinus’s spear. From the second technique, Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods onwards, even though he had managed some adaptations, it was hard to claim full mastery. Moreover, ‘The utilization of the Third Annihilation Technique, Return of the Light, remains vague.’ Return of the Light, an annihilation technique related to fire. This granted the brief resurgence of power before death, it felt misaligned with the concept of an annihilation technique. Plus, the activation condition was unclear, whether it needed to be on the verge of death. Since remembering its name, Seong Jihan hadn’t grasped the technique’s utilization. ‘Ascending from the Master League won’t be tough, but challenging the Abyss Master would be impossible without continuous growth. I need to break the Martial Soul 299 barrier.’ Seong Jihan pondered upon the Martial Soul stuck at 299 when. Knock knock. “Come in.” “Boss… it’s me.” Lee Hayeon entered as the game concluded. * * * Lee Hayeon’s condition was visibly poor upon entry. Dark circles under her eyes from a week earlier, her face seemed thinner, yet her gaze remained intensely sharp. “Hayeon, haven’t you been sleeping?” “Yes. Discovering the BattleTube channel for aliens through Jihan’s account was like finding a new world…” “Yawn. Really, there’s all sorts of stuff there…” Following Lee Hayeon, Yoon Seah also entered, appearing tired but not as visibly affected due to being a high-level player. “I recently watched ‘A proposal to escape from BattleNet’s relegation zone with just 10 million GP. Testing if it’s true.’” “That proposal. Was it real?” “No. The portal was leading to a World Tree Elves lab after all.” World Tree Elves. They’d gone that far? “What’s scarier was a reply left under the video by a World Tree Alliance Elf saying, ‘We cannot overlook the malicious defamation of the Alliance’s honor.’” “Why’s that?” “An alien who used to upload one or two videos a week on his channel hasn’t uploaded anything in 100 years since this comment was posted.” Silenced, then? The influence of the World Tree Elves was indeed significant. ------------------ <strong>HEL SCANS</strong> [Translator - Asura] [Proofreader - Gun] Join our Discord for release updates! https://discord.com/invite/dbdMDhzWa2 ------------------ “I wanted to see more because there was so much other interesting content, but Hayeon said we should focus first.” “Right, our priority now is boosting Jihan’s subscribers.” Lee Hayeon sighed deeply. “Initially, when I browsed the alien BattleTube channels using Jihan’s account, boosting subscribers didn’t seem overly difficult. The cosmos is filled with Constellations, strong players, yes, but cases like Jihan’s, not even a Constellation yet defeating one, were extremely rare. There seemed to be plenty of content to work with. But… there was a deadly flaw in BattleTube.” “What flaw?” “… BattleTube has severe racial discrimination.” “Racial discrimination?” Confused, Seong Jihan listened as Lee Hayeon elaborated. “Species interacting with BattleNet across the cosmos typically rank at least medium… These species hardly acknowledge lower and lowest rankings as equals. They don’t bother to seek out their content. So, I thoroughly browsed channels run by lower and lowest ranking species. Subscribers really don’t increase.” “Is that so?” “Yes. And even if you watch, it’s somewhat self-deprecating content? Like a lowest rank race demeaning themselves. Giving off a vibe like ‘indeed a lowly race…’” “You know it well.” Lee Hayeon’s analysis prompted the Shadow Queen to emerge from Seong Jihan’s arm. “Not anyone can browse the alien BattleTube. It requires being at a level to interact with alien races as a player. And those who reach such a level are at least medium or above… They’ve climbed by stepping on lower ranks. To them, lower rankings are fundamentally objects of contempt.” “Is that so? Then isn’t it strange that I, being the lowest rank, have around 100 subscribers?” “That makes sense… Initially, I hadn’t paid much attention to the number, but for someone from the lowest rank to gather around 100 subscribers is indeed peculiar.” BattleTube’s alien viewers, disregarding the lowest ranks. Capturing their attention would not be easy through ordinary means. “Moreover, with the diversity in species and differing ecosystems, interests vary… It’s even harder to capture the attention of outsiders with the limitation of being ‘lowest ranking’.” “That’s true.” “However, there is one interest that binds all these players together.” Lee Hayeon gestured a circle with her fingers. “GP.” “No matter how high you climb, GP seems always scarce. Videos related to GP are wildly popular.” “Even in higher leagues, the amount of GP required for revival increases. Plus, maps with strange penalties ask for ten times the GP for revival, so if you’re unlucky, you could die in game. GP is practically a lifeline in BattleNet.” Even in higher leagues, the necessity for GP grows, as Shadow Queen elaborated. To races from diverse ecosystems, the common interest was how to earn GP. “So, I had an idea…” “What is it?” “The Space Arena!” Lee Hayeon’s eyes sparkled. “You’ve participated in games there before, right? It’s a cosmos-wide betting ground for all sorts of games!” “Unnie almost quit gambling, but after searching for arena-related info, her eyes changed…” “I stopped! This time, I had no choice but to conduct research for the sake of the boss’s subscribers!” Yoon Seah shook her head in disagreement, prompting Lee Hayeon to swiftly counter. “This month’s end, there’s a game for Master League players in the arena. If the boss participates and wins consecutively as someone from the lowest rank, those scouring for players to bet on will start noticing him.” “The Space Arena… Where the bet-obsessed ultimately gather. Standing out there will inevitably attract attention, whether you like it or not. The structure of the arena, however, makes it difficult to keep winning streaks…” “Why?\\" “If you keep winning, the arena matches you with stronger opponents. But the jump in difficulty is so high that most topple after around 5 consecutive wins.” Hearing this, Seong Jihan tilted his head. When he joined the Space Arena as a game map. He had easily strung together consecutive wins. So, he encountered the concealed being, ‘Remnant of the incarnation,’ and absorbed its power. ‘Was it just easy because it was a game map?’ Thinking this, Seong Jihan asked the Shadow Queen. “Do they give experience points in the arena?” “Thinking of leveling up? The experience rewards will be substantial. Still, the penalty for losing is high… If you’re not fully prepared, your level could plummet.” “That’s fine.” If he were defeated in the arena and lost levels, how would he face the formidable foes he’d meet in the future? Seong Jihan focused more on the victory rewards than the defeat penalties. “Let’s participate in the arena. But just participating might not draw enough attention.” “How about mixing it with a high self-bet? The focus intensifies if the player himself places the bet. At first, no one may notice, but as you start winning in the arena, the high self-bet is revealed, increasing the frequency of mentions. ‘Did you see the new player? Bet a huge amount on himself.’ Something like that. And there’s more…” Lee Hayeon, passionately pouring out strategies to draw attention, was brimming with ideas, her exhaustion transforming into vigor. Even if she quit gambling, her interest in betting seemed undiminished. “Shouldn’t we upload the previous arena win as a video beforehand? To show that I dominated in the arena mission too.” “Hmm. Shall we start with that?” Accepting Yoon Seah’s suggestion, they organized past videos for upload. [A subscriber ‘CEO Octane Investments’ donates 1,000,000GP with a message.] [It is an extraterrestrial being.

[상대를 매칭합니다…….] [‘불을 품은 청룡’이 매칭됩니다.] 두 번째 상대는, 거대한 크기의 용이었다. * * * 크기로만 따지면 수십 배에서 백배까지 차이날 정도로, 사이즈가 완전히 다른 두 플레이어. 푸른 비늘을 지닌 드래곤은, 성지한을 위에서 아래로 내려다보았다. 종족 평가에 있어서는 상급 중에서도 가장 높은 평가를 받는 용족과, 최하위의 인류. 극명하게 차이 나는 둘의 크기는, 이를 대변하고 있었다. -끝났군. -‘푸른 비늘 용족’의 성좌, 청룡의 부캐지, 저 용? -맞어. 대기 속성은 다 마스터해서, 블루 드래곤의 몸으로 불을 얻겠다며 새로 세컨드 캐릭터를 키운다고 들었어. -평소라면 배당 1.1밖에 나오질 않는데…… 최하급 종족이 성지한에게 돈을 투자해서 배당이 1.4까지 올랐군. -이럼 무조건 안전 자산에 투자해야지. -아무리 최하급이 재주가 좋았어도, 청룡은 힘들어. 강력하기 짝이 없는 용족 세계에서 성좌가 된 상대, 청룡. 그가 불의 힘도 얻겠다며 키운 부캐는, 과연 강렬한 기세를 내뿜고 있었다. 조금 전의 상대, 삼두육비의 왕자에 비해서도 훨씬 강해 보이는 적. 거기에. [종족의 명운이라도 건 것인가. 수없이 많은 GP가 네게 맡겨졌구나.] “아니. 사람들이 그냥 내가 이길 거 같아서 건 건데.” [1경기의 결과, 나도 보았다. 종족의 한계를 뛰어넘는, 훌륭한 재주가 있더군. 하나…… 나는 그처럼 방심하지 않는다.] 이번 상대는, 팬티 차림이었던 삼두육비의 왕자와는 마음가짐이 달랐다. 카아아아! 거대한 용이 날개를 크게 펼치자, 경기장이 완전히 그의 존재감에 압도당하고. 파지지직……! 사방에서는 전류가 피어올라, 사방으로 뻗어나갔다. 대기의 힘을 지배하고, 뇌속성의 힘을 사용하는 블루 드래곤. 거기에 그는, 입 안에 거대한 불길마저 머금고 있었다. [사라져라!] 화르르륵……! 사방에서 내리치는 벼락과 함께, 쏟아지는 불길. 레드 드래곤이 지닌 파이어 브레스를 얻기 위해, 청룡이 단련한 불의 힘이 이 자리에서 전력을 드러낸 것이다. 거대한 재앙처럼 상대를 압도하는 불과 벼락의 맹공에, 외계 시청자들은 청룡을 환호했다. -청룡! 청룡! -최하급 상대로 전력을 다하다니……. -역시 모범이 될 만한 플레이어다. -베팅한 이들을 실망시키지 않아.. -과연 저 플레이어는 이 공격을 한 번은 막을지, 아니면 그냥 뚫려 버릴지도 베팅하고 싶은데. -내기가 성립하겠음? 저걸 어떻게 막아 ㅋㅋ 그렇게 모두가 압살당할 것이라고 예상한 성지한. 하지만. “불을 품었다더니, 겨우 그 정돈가.” 스으으윽. 성지한이 인벤토리에서 창을 꺼내자, 쏟아지는 불과 벼락이 창끝으로 모이기 시작했다. 파지지직……! 그리고 그 위에서, 서로 합치며 붉어지는 전류. 청룡의 공격은 성지한에게 전혀 통하지 않은 채. 오히려 그에게 힘만을 불어넣어 주고 있었다. [아니…… 어떻게 나의 힘을 네가 컨트롤 하지……!] “이게 전부라면, 내가 너보다 이 힘과 관련해서는 앞선 것 같군.” 성지한은 적뢰로 물든 창을 바라보더니. 휙! 이를 하늘 위로 던졌다. 혼원신공混元神功 천뢰용염天雷龍炎 천룡뇌화天龍雷火 그러자 하늘 위에 뚫리는, 하나의 균열. 새하얀 불꽃이 안에서 피어오르고, 적뢰가 그 위를 흐른다. 불을 품은 청룡이 뿜어낸 두 힘이, 서로 융합되지 못했던 것과는 달리. 단단히 결합한 백염과 적뢰. [이건…… 로드의 브레스…….] 청룡이 경악한 눈으로 하늘을 바라보는 사이. 화르르르! 균열은 점점 커 가며 하늘을 뒤엎고. 그 안에서 피어오르던 백염은, 일제히 대지를 향해 쏟아졌다. 화르르르……! 순식간에 천룡뇌화에 직격당해, 몸이 타오르는 청룡. [너는 분명, 우리의 동족이 아니건만…….] “용만 드래곤 브레스 쓰란 법 있냐.” 성지한이 가볍게 한마디 하자. [……허. 신성이 나타났군.] 청룡은 그 한마디를 끝으로, 불에 잠식되어 사라졌다. -아, 안 돼……. -이놈은 뭔 미친 소리를 하는 거야! 드래곤 브레스는 용만 쓰는 거라고! -청룡 대체 뭐 하냐! 이거 승부 조작 아니야? 어떻게 용이 최하급이 쏜 불길에 대항도 못 하고 사라져?! -으, 으…… 안 돼! 빨리 다시 재생해 청룡! 우리 1억 동족이 다 멸망하게 생겼다고!! 1경기와는 달리, 아비규환이 된 성지한의 외계인 채팅창. 그에게 믿음을 가지지 않았던 외계인 시청자들은, 그 대가를 톡톡히 치르는 중이었다. -1억 동족 저거 설마…… 아까 1억 빌런임? ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ -ㅇㅇ 맞음. 빚 갚고 다신 베팅 안 한다더니 2경기에 바로 베팅하는 거 봐라 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ -애초에 행성 담보로 삼을 정도면 중증 도박 중독잔데 베팅 안할 리가 없지……. -운이 좋아 한 번 살았을 뿐, 저런 놈은 결국 파산함 이번처럼 ㅇㅇ 혹시나 해서 성지한에게 베팅했던 소수의 외계인들만 상대를 비웃으며 채팅을 하고 있을 때. [승자, 성지한.] 어느덧, 승부는 끝이 났다. ‘상대가 성좌 부캐라 해도, 어쨌거나 마스터라 싱겁네.’ 비록 온갖 버프를 다 받긴 했어도, 성지한은 성좌 롱기누스와 대항했던 몸. 그런 그에게 마스터리그에 머물고 있는 플레이어 따위야, 충분히 상대할 만 했다. ‘다음 리그론 안 올라가나.’ 차라리 그랜드마스터 리그로 올라가, 싸우는 게 낫겠다고 생각하고 있을 때. [레벨이 1 오릅니다.] [특별 보상을 얻습니다] 1라운드와는 달리, 성지한에게 보상이 주어졌다. 스페이스 아레나 경기라 그런지, 2명 잡고 바로 올라 준 레벨. 아레나와 일반 게임을 병행하다보면 400레벨도 금방 도달하겠다고 생각하며. 성지한은 특별 보상에 눈을 돌렸다. 그리고. [특별 보상, ‘종족 진화 보너스’가 주어집니다.] [뇌속성 친화도가 +1 상승합니다] 드래곤을 잡고 나온 보상이, 그의 배틀튜브 화면을 통해 시청자들에게 드러났다. -종족 진화?! -뇌속성 친화도라니! -블루 드래곤을 제압해서 준 건가……. -특별 보상이 2경기 만에 뜨다니. 원래 확률은 10%도 채 안 될 텐데? -여러모로 운이 좋은 플레이어군 진화 보너스 항목을 보면서, 이게 왜 벌써 나오냐며 술렁이는 외계인들. -뇌속성 친화도? -그럼 전기 마법 더 잘 다루는 건가. -난 뇌속성이랑 관련 없는데 ㅋㅋㅋ 그냥 체력 올려 주지 ㅋㅋ -그러게, 일반인은 전기 쓸 일이 없어서…… 감전이나 덜 당하려나? -성지한님이 진화 보너스 따 왔으면 아무거나 감사하고 받아야지 뭘 그렇게 따져 ㅡㅡ -ㄹㅇㅋㅋ 배가 불렀어. 인간들 GP도 이번 게임으로 많이 벌어 놓고 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 한편 인류는 건강이 증진되었을 때보다, 체감되는 정도가 크지 않아서 그런지. 좋긴 한데 실감은 안 난다는 반응이 주류였다. 한편 성지한은, 흥미로운 눈으로 메시지를 바라보았다. ‘뇌속성 친화도라…… 블루 드래곤을 잡아서 얻은 건가?’ 지금까진 건강에 관련된 걸 많이 받았던 것 같은데. 이런 식으로 진화하는 루트도 있군. 성지한이 그리 생각하면서, 봉황기를 거둬들였다. 그러면서 한 번 적뢰를 움직이자. 지지지직……. 조금 전보다, 뇌전의 흐름이 살짝 가벼워진 게 느껴졌다. ‘이거…… 나한테도 적용되는구나.’ 건강이 증진되었을 때야, 성지한이 무혼도 있고 생명의 기운도 품고 있어서 건강의 화신 그 자체라 체감이 되질 않았지만. 이번 건은 달랐다. +1밖에 오르지 않아 그런지 미약한 효과기는 했지만. 확실하게, 친화도가 늘어난 게 느껴졌다. ‘인류를 위해서뿐만 아니라, 나를 위해서라도 챙겨야겠네. 이거.’ 이런 보너스까지 주고, 아레나 완전 좋은 곳이었구나. 성지한은 입가에 씩 미소를 지었다. 그리고. “종족…… 진화 보너스라니.” “아, 아레나에서…… 이걸 준단 말입니까?” 성지한의 배틀튜브를 지켜보던 배틀넷 연맹 관계자들은. 아레나에서 종족 전체에게 적용되는 보너스가 주어지는 걸 확인하고는, 급히 긴급 회의를 소집했다.

It’s saved!! However, as the actual bet amounts started inflating and coming in, the chat was quickly flooded with incessant messages. - When the constellatory alt of Three Heads appeared, I thought it was all over… - To sweep it away with a single strike. - Ah, I should've bet more GP… Regretting betting only a little now. - This player, for being lowest rank, is stronger than expected? - Still, he was attacked without armor, so it's still hard to say how strong he really is. - We're saved! Freedom for the 100 million citizens...! I'll pay off my debts and never bet again! - 100 million villain’s back lol Responses expressing regret for not betting more on Seong Jihan, and those surprised by the powerful attack of the lowest-ranked player, coexisted in the chat. - At this rate, it’s worth betting on the next game too. - Gotta bet the same amount I won this time lol - I’m passing. With the armor on, the fight would have been unknown. - Having subdued the Prince of Three Heads and Six Arms, he’ll be matched against stronger opponents next… Wouldn’t it be tough? - Well, he’s still lowest-ranked after all. Still, the portion of those willing to continue betting on Seong Jihan wasn’t very high. Although they enjoyed this one win, they believed his victory was because his opponent had voluntarily removed his armor. Meanwhile, - Ahh… Told you. 1:1 battles end even quicker. - Was looking forward to a Space Arena match, but he died in one hit ㅡㅡ - The opponent, thinking Seong Jihan was just lowest rank, even removed his armor smh… - Thinks he’s some kind of elite, taking on the battle in just underwear lol The human viewers, having seen Seong Jihan's victories in the past, displayed an indifferent reaction, taking for granted that this outcome was expected. Then, - Hey, but the alien chat was going crazy, right? - ?? Why? - They bet on Seong Jihan. - Eh? You can bet in the arena? I’m a betting site regular, but haven’t seen that. - Uh… There’s now a new arena section if you go check? As the arena betting was just added to the betting sites, humans also began to show interest. - Wow, why are Seong Jihan’s odds so high? - Seong Jihan, a safe asset like him, getting treated like this… - This is a must-bet, right? - Being treated as lowest rank has its perks lol lol lol Every Earthling knew Seong Jihan’s unmatched strength. But in the arena betting, his strength was severely underrated due to the stigma of being from the lowest rank. - But isn’t it a bit much to just bet willy-nilly? Watching the alien chat, it seems the contenders now are constellation alts? - Seong Jihan won against a constellation, what chance would alts stand? lol - lmao - Normally, I don’t do betting, but this is different. This game's a guaranteed win - Withdrew my entire fortune. To the moon! Unlike the alien species, humans, who had solid faith in Seong Jihan they'd observed over time, began pouring enormous amounts of GP into betting on the next game in the arena. Consequently, in the betting odds for the next game’s winner, the odds designated for Seong Jihan rapidly dropped. - Why are the odds for lowest rank like this? - Makes it less fun… - Looks like the lowest rank’s kin invested a huge amount. - Lowest rank still has that much GP left? - If the odds are like this, there’s no point betting on lowest rank. I’d rather bet on the opponent. - But this player beat a constellation, right? - Saw the video subduing the high-elf. Lucked out to win, wasn’t skill. Thus, the alien species, not feeling the appeal to bet on Seong Jihan, instead flocked towards his next opponent. The victory in the first game was seen as a fluke because the Prince of Three Heads and Six Arms had removed his armor, and from the next game onward, they believed his true skill would be tested. And the second game commenced. [Matching opponent…] [‘Fire-Breathing Azure Dragon’ has been matched.] The second opponent was a massive dragon. * * * Judging by size alone, the disparity was between tens to hundreds of times difference, illustrating a complete mismatch. The dragon, adorned with blue scales, looked down on Seong Jihan from above. In the ranking of species, the high-ranking dragonkin, among the highest, stood stark against the lowest-ranked humans. Their drastic size difference symbolized their respective standings. - It’s over. - 'Blue-Scaled Dragonkin', the constellation alt dragon, that one? - Right. Mastered atmospheric attributes to acquire fire within the Blue Dragon’s form, heard he was raising a second character for it. - Normally, the odds wouldn’t exceed 1.1… but due to the lowest rank investing in Seong Jihan, it rose to 1.4. - Gotta invest in safe assets, then. - No matter how skilled the lowest rank is, the Blue Dragon will be challenging. Facing an opponent who had become a constellation in the formidable dragon world, the Blue Dragon. His alt character, seeking to gain the power of fire, truly exuded a formidable aura. A far stronger-looking foe than the earlier opponent, the Prince of Three Heads and Six Arms. Moreover, [Is it the fate of your species at stake? A vast amount of GP has been entrusted to you.] “Not really. People just think I’ll win.” [I’ve seen the results of the first game. You possess exceptional talent beyond the limits of your species. However… I won’t be complacent.] This opponent had a different mindset from the underwear-clad Prince of Three Heads and Six Arms. The giant dragon spread its wings wide, dominantly marking its presence on the battlefield. Sparks flew from all directions, extending outwards. The Blue Dragon, controlling atmospheric power and utilizing lightning attributes, also harbored a massive blaze within his mouth. [Disappear!] With the striking thunder and pouring flames, the fire power the Blue Dragon honed to acquire the Red Dragon’s Fire Breath was fully unleashed at this moment. The overwhelming onslaught of fire and lightning, akin to a massive calamity, had the alien viewers cheering for the Blue Dragon. - Blue Dragon! Blue Dragon! - Using full power against the lowest rank… - Truly a player to be emulated. - Not disappointing those who bet… - Really, will this player block the attack once, or just get annihilated? I’d bet on that. - You think that bet would stand? How’s he supposed to stop that lol Everyone expected Seong Jihan to be utterly crushed. But, “Holding fire within, and that’s all you've got?” As Seong Jihan pulled out his spear from the inventory, the pouring fire and lightning began converging towards the spear’s tip. And atop it, red lightning merged, turning more intense. The Blue Dragon’s attack had no effect on Seong Jihan, instead, it only fueled his strength. [How… how do you control my power...!] “If that's all, then I might be more advanced than you in this power.” Seong Jihan, looking at the spear now dyed in red lightning, enlightened! He threw it high up into the sky. Chaos Essence Technique Heavenly Thunder Dragon Flame Heavenly Dragon Lightning Fire Then, a rift formed in the sky. White flames blossomed from within, with red lightning flowing over them. Unlike the Blue Dragon’s combined powers, which failed to merge, the white and red energies tightly bound. [Is this… the Lord’s Breath…] While the Blue Dragon watched the sky in shock, A vast firestorm overturned the sky, and from within, the white flames poured down towards the ground. The Blue Dragon, directly hit by the Heavenly Dragon Lightning Fire, began to burn. [Though not of our kin…] “You think only dragons can use Dragon’s Breath?” Seong Jihan lightly commented, [Heh. A deity has appeared.] With that, the Blue Dragon was engulfed in flames and vanished. - Ah, no… - What’s with that crazy talk! Dragon Breath is for dragons only! - What was the Blue Dragon doing! Isn’t this match-fixing? How could a dragon be defeated by the lowest rank’s flames?! - Ugh, ugh… No! Quick, respawn, Blue Dragon! My 100 million kin are facing doom!! Unlike the first game, Seong Jihan’s alien chat turned into complete chaos. The alien viewers, who had not placed their trust in him, were now paying the price. - The 100 million kin… isn’t that the 100 million villain from before? lol lol lol - Yep, that’s him. Swore off betting after paying debts and immediately bets on the second game lol lol - Anyone leveraging their planet as collateral is a severe gambling addict… - Lucky once but such folks eventually go bankrupt like now yup yup While a minority of aliens, who happened to bet on Seong Jihan, chuckled in the chat, [Winner: Seong Jihan.] the match had already concluded. ‘Even if the opponent’s a constellation alt, being just in the Master League makes it a bit dull.’ Seong Jihan, having received various buffs, stood a chance against the constellation Longinus. For him, a player remaining in the Master League was definitely manageable. ‘Won’t I move up to the next league?’ Contemplating ascending to the Grand Master League for a worthy challenge, [Your level increases by 1.] [A special reward is granted.] Different from the first round, Seong Jihan received a reward. Due to it being a Space Arena match, leveling up immediately after defeating two opponents, if he kept juggling the arena and general games, reaching level 400 would be swift. Seong Jihan then turned his attention to the special reward. And, [A special reward, ‘Race Evolution Bonus’ is granted.] [Your affinity for lightning attributes increases by +1.] The reward for defeating the dragon appeared on the screen for his viewers to see through BattleTube. - Race evolution?! - Lightning attribute affinity! - Is it given for subduing the Blue Dragon…? - A special reward appearing just in the second game. Normally, the chances are less than 10%? - Quite the lucky player As the aliens murmured, wondering why such a reward appeared so soon, - Lightning attribute affinity? - Does that mean better control over electric magic? - Not related to lightning lol Just increase my health, will ya? lol - Right, normal people don’t use electricity… maybe less likely to get electrocuted? - If Seong Jihan obtained the evolution bonus, we should be thankful and accept it, why complain ㅡㅡ - True lol Got too comfortable. Humans made a fortune with this game lol lol Meanwhile, humans, not feeling as significant as when health improved, mostly reacted with indifference, acknowledging the benefit but without much excitement. On the other hand, Seong Jihan, with keen interest, observed the message. ‘Lightning attribute affinity… obtained from the Blue Dragon?’ It seemed he mostly received health-related rewards until now. So, evolving in this manner was also possible. As he thought that, Seong Jihan collected the phoenix feathers. Then, he manipulated a stream of red lightning. A lighter flow of electric current was perceptible than before. ‘It… applies to me too.’ While health improvements were hardly noticeable for Seong Jihan, given his spiritual warrior status and life energy, making him akin to a health deity, this time was different. Though the effect was subtle, a clear increase in affinity was felt. ‘Not just for humanity, but for myself as well, I have to keep this in mind.’ Realizing even such bonuses were provided, he found the arena to be a truly rewarding place. Seong Jihan’s lips curled into a slight smile. And then, “Race… evolution bonus, huh.” “Ah, in the arena… they give out such things?” Watching Seong Jihan’s BattleTube, BattleNet Federation officials, upon confirming that bonuses applying to entire races were distributed in the arena, quickly convened an urgent meeting."},{"instruction":"You will be translating a text while maintaining consistency with previously translated related texts.

And then, “Race… evolution bonus, huh.” “Ah, in the arena… they give out such things?” Watching Seong Jihan’s BattleTube, BattleNet Association officials, Upon confirming that bonuses applying to entire races were distributed in the arena, quickly convened an urgent meeting. Chapter 331 [Oh, Head! What a surprise to hear from you first. What brings this about?] The one Seong Jihan reached out to was Kalein, from the Constellation of the Dead Star. Players who receive sponsorships could not initiate contact with their Constellation sponsors, making this an unusual situation. Seong Jihan had looked back at the channel of Kalein, who had subscribed to him. [Pain VS Joy. What’s the best way to draw more of death’s aura from a subject?] [Effective Torture Techniques by Species – Dragonkind Edition] [For the creation of the ultimate undead, we tried abducting a deity.] His channel, filled with grotesque videos, drew a strong reaction. “Ugh… If this wasn’t BattleTube, all of this would have to be censored.” “Jihan, may I go rest for a while…?” “Sure, sure. Take your rest.” Even Lee Hayeon and Yoon Seah, who had developed some tolerance for brutal scenes due to BattleNet, found it difficult to watch the videos posted by the Constellation of the Dead Star to the end. The videos were not only brutal but chillingly meticulous in their experiments, eliciting a primal sense of rejection in any human. Nonetheless, given the wealth of information that would likely appeal to those interested in necromancer classes, ‘He has over a million subscribers.’ Kalein’s channel boasted a considerable number of subscribers. While Seong Jihan was browsing through the channel, Kalein sent an additional message. [You’ve started BattleTube, I see…] “Yeah. That’s why I contacted you. Can you write a post on the official forum for me? About VIP card certification.” [Hey. Is that all you want after contacting me? If you become my head, we can collaborate on something even bigger. How about it? I can give you a boost!] “If I became your head, wouldn’t we merge into one entity? Then what about my channel?” [No, it doesn’t have to be that way~ You could take over and the Constellation of the Dead Star could vanish, leaving a powerful Seong Jihan behind. Who knows! Let’s do it!] “Forget it.” [Ah. Alright. Then, how about a trial period as my head? Just 10 days! I’ll make sure we’re separated definitively after 10 days!] “Forget I asked.” What was he thinking, offering a “trial period”? Despite Seong Jihan’s firm refusal, Kalein displayed his disappointment. [Che… What a shame. What’s your level now?] “370.” [What? My alt character isn’t even at 300 yet… How did you level up so fast? You’ll become a Constellation in no time.] “It appears you’re not as committed to your alt.” [What are you talking about? I’m top-ranking in most games! But you… blasting through the hellish leveling phase after 300 so quickly… Hey. If you become a Constellation, we can’t merge!] “Is that so? That’s actually good news.” [Urgh… If my head becomes a Constellation, making my involvement pointless, then there’s no reason to help you.] That was indeed the case. The Constellation of the Dead Star’s favor towards Seong Jihan was based on the premise that he was the most optimized candidate to become his “head.” If Seong Jihan refused and ascended further as a Constellation, Kalein would have no reason to support him. [Looks like I’ll need to be compensated for writing the post. That bottle you obtained from the Constellation Laboratory… just hand me one of those. Not the regenerative one, something else!] “How did you know about that?” [Hehe. A Constellation keeps an eye on what his head is up to!] Was he stalking him? While Seong Jihan considered severing ties with the sponsoring Constellation, But he pulled out the bottles he had acquired from his inventory. ‘Aside from the regenerative one, the others’ exact functions are still unknown.’ The bottles, filled with life essence and various energies. Seong Jihan had tried consuming a few himself and closely examined the energies within others, but only sensed a slight increase in the power of Eternity within him, not achieving any meaningful results. ‘I should give him the one with the weakest life energy.’ Deciding thus, Seong Jihan picked out the lowest quality item from the bottles he had reclaimed. “How am I supposed to send it?” [Oh, you’re really giving it to me? Wait a moment…!] Following Kalein’s brief cut-off, a new window appeared in front of Seong Jihan. [The sponsoring Constellation ‘Constellation of the Dead Star’ requests a tribute.] [Please place the item here.] After the message finished, a swirling black mist appeared before Seong Jihan. He placed the bottle into it, and as the black energy vanished, a message from Kalein arrived. [Oh…! Hey, this is pretty useful! Wow, you actually gave me something good!] “Really? I didn’t know its use, so I just sent one over. But what is it used for?” Feigning ignorance, Seong Jihan asked about the bottle’s purpose, given the situation. [Hehe… This might well be refined World Tree energy. It likely serves to increase the maximum limit of vitality. ] “Increases vitality, huh. The fruit of the World Tree seemed to have a similar effect.” [That’s the general effect felt by players. This one is refined well enough to apply even at the Constellation level.] “It’s of a higher purity?” [Yeah. I haven’t seen the other bottles, so I can’t say they all serve that purpose.] Refined World Tree energy, then. That explained why consuming it increased the power of Eternity. ‘I’ll have to set aside a day to consume them all.’ Perhaps this could even raise his Eternity stat from 2 to 3. As Seong Jihan decided how to utilize the bottles, [Considering the quality of what you’ve given me, one post on the forum doesn’t seem enough. I’ll upload a related video too!] “Oh? Really? Thanks.” Pleased with the contents of the bottle, Kalein decided to upload a video as well. [So, get started with the arena participation. I’ll upload a video related to that.] “Got it.” Seong Jihan had planned to participate in the arena anyway for the sake of leveling up, regardless of subscriber numbers. Right there, Seong Jihan promptly applied for entrance into the Space Arena. [Do you wish to participate in the Space Arena?] [You are a rookie in the Space Arena. You receive rookie benefits.] [You are a VIP member. The entry fee for the arena is waived.] The entry fee for the arena, normally discounted by 30% to 70 billion GP for rookies, was entirely waived for VIP members, demonstrating a powerful effect. [You are affiliated with the Master League.] [You are assigned to the ‘Master - 1’ area.] [Matching with players from the Master League…] [The match has been made.] [You will be summoned to the arena in 24 hours.] ‘That was quick.’ The game’s matchmaking process progressed swiftly upon applying for the arena. Seong Jihan informed Kalein of this development. “I’ve applied. The match is in 24 hours.” [Oh? Really? Which area were you matched in?] “Master – 1.” [Master 1? That place is full of alt characters… If you were in 2, that would’ve been better.] Kalein commented thus but then, [Alright. Here goes a 10 trillion GP bet video.] He immediately fulfilled his promise made to Seong Jihan. * * * The Space Arena, one of BattleNet’s venues where a significant amount of GP is wagered, was full of spirits akin to phantoms looking for a big win after facing devastating losses betting. -Is there any sure win available? -I’ve put up a planet as collateral and gathered all the GP I’ve got… Where should I bet? Please save me… If I fail this time, a hundred million of my kin will die! └ It’s because of you they’re dying lol └ Really, this guy’s a ruling Constellation? When the arena is about to open, posts about betting frequently appear on the official forum. The recent buzz among these folks was about a post Kalein had made. A lowest-ranking species athlete with VIP membership, lauded for his tremendous talent and expected to win consecutive matches. The post, encouraging bets on him along with a video of Kalein betting 10 trillion GP on him, caught everyone’s attention. And immediately, official members began responding to the post. [Have you seen the post by DeathStar recommending a player?] He recommended a lowest-ranking species, and in the video, he bet 10 trillion GP on him. This player even has a VIP membership and seems fairly competent. But betting on the lowest-ranking species is a bit… What do you all think, members, is this player worth betting on? └ DeathStar invested, so I subscribed and checked it out, but he seems just above average for the lowest rank… └ Betting on the lowest rank is a guaranteed loss. You can’t overcome the fundamental difference in class. Disappointed in DeathStar this time. └ I honestly found this player quite good. There’s potential. But being assigned to Master -1 is an error… that area’s filled with high-ranking Constellations’ alt characters. Betting difficulty is at its highest. └ Exactly. If it goes wrong, they can bring in powers from their main Constellations. └ Just for fun, I’ll throw in 100,000 GP. Thinking about it, I’ve never bet on the lowest rank before lol Despite having a VIP membership, the overall reception was negative due to the inherent limitations of being the lowest-ranking species. Most who spoke favorably still doubted high achievements in ‘Master - 1,’ where he was placed. “Life’s tough as the lowest ranking.” Seong Jihan chuckled, browsing through the forum reactions, and the Shadow Queen responded. “Well, it’s true that the lowest rank has no survival record in the Space League.” “Not even one?” “Mmm… It’s likely. The longer you survive in the Space League, the more your species evolves. Survivors, even if they want to remain in the lowest rank, end up receiving race evolution effects, ascending to low or mid-rank.” “I see.” “Arena special rewards often include evolution bonuses, so it might be worth targeting. The Constellation’s alts participate for that reason too.” Seong Jihan’s eyes gleamed at that. There were such bonuses in the arena? ‘Let’s see if I can ascend to low-rank, then.’ If the human race evolved, it would ultimately be a plus for Seong Jihan himself. Intending to fully claim the arena’s special rewards, Seong Jihan thought, “Jihan. The alien subscriber count has surpassed 3,000! Also, videos of your battles against the World Tree Elves are experiencing a surge in views from alien sources. Seems like strong opposition is attracting more attention… I’ll continue uploading compilation videos focused on that!” Although the majority of alien species had either skimmed through or not played Seong Jihan’s videos at all, the ones showcasing battles against the World Tree Elves had noticeably high views. -For being from the lowest rank, he’s not entirely weak, huh? -He even subdued an Ancient elf? Maybe I should bet a little. And a few comments from alien species began to appear. “Yes. Please prioritize recent videos.” After delegating the video sorting to Lee Hayeon, [You will be summoned to the arena.] Seong Jihan was forcibly teleported to the arena. [Do you wish to broadcast the match live to alien species?] Upon turning on BattleTube, a new message popped up. Seong Jihan agreed, and the chat split into two. -Oh, it’s the arena… I guess it’s different from regular games. -Hopefully, it’s not over in 10 minutes this time? -Who knows, 1:1 might even end quicker, right? Humans, who considered Seong Jihan’s overwhelming victories a given, were anxious it might end too swiftly, while, -A hundred million lives of my species depend on you. Just win one, one game! If you win, I’ll sponsor you generously! -The 100-million villain actually bet on the lowest rank lol -A ruling Constellation betting all on the lowest rank… your planet’s inhabitants are to be pitied. -If that gambling addict loses his planet, maybe they’ll find a better ruler lol -A live broadcast makes the human race seem even less impressive. He won’t win a single game. Even as they watched Seong Jihan’s live broadcast, alien species expressed skepticism. ‘Oh. The number of alien viewers is quite high.’ Even though subscribers were only about 3,000, Given the bets placed on VIP member Seong Jihan, the viewer count steadily climbed, soon reaching 5,000. ‘Hmm… but crossing 5,000 doesn’t trigger the Star Buff.’ The Star Buff, supposedly activated upon surpassing a viewer count threshold, remained inactive despite attracting a significant number of alien species. And then, [Matching opponent…] [‘Prince of Three Heads and Six Arms’ has been matched.] A giant figure appeared across the arena, with three heads and six arms, decked in full armor, staring down at Seong Jihan. -Is the Prince of Three Heads and Six Arms still here? -So sick of Constellation alts lol -Aaaaaah why him aaaaaah my planet The alien chat’s reaction was resigned, considering the match already lost upon his appearance. Then, the three-headed giant, “Lowest rank…” Looking at Seong Jihan, he voluntarily removed his armor and weapons. “Against a creature like you, wearing equipment would be an insult.” Reduced to just his underwear, the three-headed giant approached Seong Jihan, spreading his six arms wide, as if to easily squash him. Despite the light gesture, the power behind it was undeniable. However, “Good thing you’re not wearing armor.” As Eclipse flared in Seong Jihan’s hand, “Now you can say you lost because you weren’t armored.” Swoosh! The giant’s three heads soared through the air, separated from his body. And a brief message popped up, [Victor: Seong Jihan.] The first match ended in the blink of an eye. Chapter 330 The giant octopus race member, Octane, who proclaimed himself a legendary investor. He called Seong Jihan a blue chip and talked about making significant investments in him, but… ‘After realizing humans have no growth limit, he withdrew his share investment proposal and vanished.’ He mentioned BattleNet would not simply overlook someone with no growth limit, choosing to withdraw not just investments but also withholding information before disappearing. And now he’s showing up again… ‘Well, might as well accept it.’ Seong Jihan accepted the sponsorship. And then, [It’s been a while, blue chip. Well, now that your name is out… I’ll call you Seong Jihan.] “Do as you like.” [Seeing you upload that old arena video, are you finally starting activities?] “Starting activities… If it’s related to BattleTube, you could say that.” [Heh. I recognized your potential when you subdued me at the North Wall… Though I couldn’t make an equity investment due to complications. If you’re participating in the arena this time, you’ll be the season’s player with the highest returns.] Continuing, he said, [Especially being from the lowest rank actually appeals to investors… I recommended you to several groups who share investment values with me, but everyone disregarded investing in some lowest rank species. If only you were at least low rank, my recommendation would’ve already got you over a thousand subscribers. It shows how rare an interest in the lowest rank is…] “So it was your group who subscribed when I wasn’t even actively doing anything?” [No, around 50 from our side. The rest… I have no idea who subscribed…] “Hmm. Is that so?” Who are the remaining 50? Seong Jihan tried to check the subscribers through BattleTube settings, but, [Account is private.] Aside from a few, most accounts were private. ‘Among the open ones, some are from the Constellation of the Dead Star or the World Tree Elf line.‘ Constellation of the dead star who showed obsession towards Seong Jihan, or his eternal adversaries, the World Tree Elves. These were all subscribers in some way connected to Seong Jihan. Removing Octane’s acquaintance, practically no pure subscribers remained. ‘Would be strange to have subscribers without actually starting activities, anyway.’ So far, he had hidden his identity with Hideout, engaging only with human viewers on BattleTube. There was no need for extraterrestrial beings to bother subscribing here. Rather, excluding former connections, how the rest subscribed was nearly miraculous. Seong Jihan planned to steadily grow from here on, continuing his chat with Octane. “How do you increase subscribers?” [Why do you want to increase subscribers… Fame brings scrutiny. Being unnoticed as the lowest rank race is rather advantageous here. You can gamble on yourself for large amounts of GP…] “Right now, I need fame more than GP.” [Is that so. You’re being exposed on purpose… Have you chosen Spotlight over Hideout?] Quick to grasp the situation upon hearing Seong Jihan’s story, Octane continued, “Exactly. I just upgraded my membership, and Spotlight seems more beneficial.” [What? You upgraded your membership? Don’t tell me you got VIP…] “Yeah.” [I can hardly believe it. Can you record it and show me? Then, I’ll sponsor 10 million GP.] Octane, showing considerable interest in the VIP membership, offered more. “Live broadcast?” [Yes.] “Fine. Let’s start right now.” Thus, Seong Jihan immediately turned on BattleTube. * * * - Uh… the game ended a while ago? - Oh… it’s a penthouse! Is this a live broadcast? - This is that living room! Where Seong Jihan had his first broadcast! As soon as Seong Jihan started broadcasting following his game victory, viewers poured in. - Yoon Seah and Lee Hayeon are also there. - Why do they look like that? LOL - Especially Lee Hayeon… it was all makeup… The chat didn’t hesitate to comment on Lee Hayeon and Yoon Seah’s faces appearing on the screen. As the number of viewers surged instantly. More comments about Lee Hayeon, who looked considerably more tired, filled the chat. She read the chats on the spot and frowned. “Really, these people. It’s not because of makeup, okay? It’s because we’ve been staying up all night.” “Yeah. unnie and I have been up all night watching alien broadcasts with my uncle's account. There’s a lot of interesting stuff.” “Wow. We both stayed up, but only Seah looks unworried… That’s why being high-level is the best.” Despite staying up together, Lee Hayeon looked noticeably more affected than Yoon Seah, another testament to the difference between a supporting player and a regular player. “Here.” Seong Jihan slowly pulled out the membership card from his inventory. “What I’m broadcasting today is simple. Space League membership card verification.” The card itself shone with a rainbow hue, the VIP membership card. - Membership card? - Pretty card haha - Is that glow natural? - What’s so good about VIP? While viewers reacted lightly, seeing it as merely a fancy card, [Indeed… It was true. How did you acquire a VIP membership… one that even Constellations struggle to get?] Shocked by seeing the VIP card, [A subscriber ‘CEO Octane Investments’ donates 10,000,000GP.] He kept his promise. - ?? 10 million GP? - Isn’t that the previous octopus? - The scale of a universal big shot, insane Viewers who came to watch Seong Jihan’s broadcast were astounded to see such a huge amount of sponsorship from an extraterrestrial. [Don’t upload this video. Promise to delete it, and I’ll sponsor a hundred million GP.] Octane even offered a hundred million GP to have the video deleted. But, “No. This needs to be uploaded.” Seeing Octane’s reaction, Seong Jihan realized the impact of the VIP membership. […Then I’ll sponsor a billion.] “I’ll pass.” Despite Octane offering ten times more, Seong Jihan’s response was firm. - A billion? - This extraterrestrial big shot is nuts - Was the video of VIP authentication worth that much? - Exactly LOL. It’s just a pretty card LOL […So you desire fame that much?] “Right now, fame is more important to me than GP.” [If you expose yourself too much in the Space League, you’ll be targeted by strong figures. Especially someone irregular like you, many are waiting for an opportunity to strike.] “That’s okay. I’m a Constellation candidate right now, so I’m under protection.” After the candidacy ends, the Martial God's disciple would be more of a problem than the extraterrestrial strong ones. Already riding a tiger, Seong Jihan had to utilize any means to gather strength. [Huh… No choice then…] ------------------ <strong>HEL SCANS</strong> [Translator - Asura] [Proofreader - Gun] Join our Discord for release updates! https://discord.com/invite/dbdMDhzWa2 ------------------ Octane gave up on the deal after seeing Seong Jihan not giving in even if he tried to bid more than a billion GP. At that moment, Seong Jihan saw the Shadow Queen, who had been outside, come in. Unlike earlier, she was cowering in a corner of the living room. Approaching her, Seong Jihan inquired, “What do you think? Broadcasting widely that I’m a VIP during the protection period.” “A good approach, Seong Jihan. To boost subscribers, broadcasting that you’re a VIP would be effective.” The Shadow Queen suddenly spoke formally, using honorific language in response to Seong Jihan’s question. “…What's with the sudden change? It doesn’t suit you.” “What do you mean? I’m Ariel. I’ve always been like this, haven’t I?” “Even Ariel didn’t act like that.” “Did I not? Well… Seong Jihan… May I retreat now?” The Shadow Queen, who ventured outside with chains clanking around her, now wanted to return inside. As they conversed, a message from Octane arrived. [Seong Jihan. Is that the Shadow Queen?] “Why?” […So she is. I heard she was captured by the World Tree Alliance and thought I lost my investment!] Seong Jihan didn’t deny, and Octane quickly identified her identity. [Queen… I’m relieved to see you’re alive. Hehe. Then you can repay your investment, right?] “Queen, huh, the delusion is too much. I’m not the queen, just a mere shadow avatar of the queen. And even if she was alive, how would you repay a failed investment?” [You can pay with your body. Serve as a mercenary for our Investments firm. A 1000 years should cover the debt.] “Ah, right. There was something the queen mentioned before. She pledged her planet as collateral. Why not execute that?” [How could we take over a planet seized by the World Tree Alliance?] “That’s for the investor to figure out.” Octane pressuring the debt, and the queen attempting to wriggle out. -Alien species also ditch debts and abscond… -Who’s the bad one here? -Isn’t it obvious? Has to be the World Tree Elves LOL -LOL -When in doubt, the bad guy is always the World Tree Alliance LOL As Seong Jihan watched their bickering, he clapped his hands. “You two sort out your issues later. That’s it for the broadcast.” [Seong Jihan… Hand her over to me, and I’ll give you 1 trillion GP. The Shadow Queen would be useful as a mercenary… Yeah. I’ll even share the profits.] The proposal from the Ceo of Octane Investments to offer 1 trillion GP and even profits. Seong Jihan turned towards the Shadow Queen. “What do you think? Wanna go?” “Master! Please! You know I’m not the queen!” [Pleeeaaase.Seong Jihan. Anywhere but there!!] The Shadow Queen, cried out ‘Master’ aloud while internally screaming to Seong Jihan. She really didn’t want to be associated with Octane Investments. Seeing her decidedly appalled reaction, Seong Jihan chuckled. “Sorry, but she’s my sword. I’ll keep her.” [A sword? I can provide you with better equipment. So hand her over.] “Nothing less than EX grade.” [EX? Too greedy… SSS grade weapons can be swapped. So think it over and let me know.] Seong Jihan put Octane off for now but Octane left an opening till the very end. “Well, everyone. See you next time.” Beep! As the broadcast ended, the Shadow Queen immediately sighed in relief. “Phew… That was close. I never expected him to pop up. If you had handed me over, I’d have become a slave to Octane Investments.” “Is it that bad to be affiliated with them?” “If you get dragged there, there’s hardly any mercenary surviving for a hundred years.” “A hundred years is quite a long life.” “…Are you serious?” Gazing at Seong Jihan, the Shadow Queen rolled her eyes. “I intended to assist by writing a post on the official forum… But it seems impossible. If the name of the Shadow Queen becomes exposed again, those investor CEOs like Octane would swarm me to press the debt.” “How much debt did you rack up?” “Just for rising to Dominion level 8, I made some large investments… and it all turned to smoke thanks to the World Tree Alliance.” Grinding her teeth, the Shadow Queen made a suggestion to Seong Jihan. “Maybe you write a post on the official forum. Most will think it’s just an advertisement for the lowest rank race and ignore it, but if you certify the VIP card, it should help.” “Will it be more effective if a certified person does it?” “Certainly. Especially if you’re of Constellation origin. There’ll even be a Constellation certification mark beside your ID.” “Hmm…” Pondering upon her words, Seong Jihan fell into deep thought. ‘It’d be more beneficial for a Constellation to write it than me doing it myself…' And right then, Among his subscriber list was someone perfect for such a request. Next, here is the current text to translate: Chapter 333: <2레벨로 회귀한 무신 333화> 뉴욕의 세계 배틀넷 연맹 본부. 그곳에서는, 각 나라의 연맹 고위 관계자가 모여서 심각한 얼굴로 회의를 진행하고 있었다. “오늘의 회의 안건은, 스페이스 아레나의 진화 보너스입니다.” “뇌속성 친화도 +1…… 효과는 어떻습니까?” “마법사들의 전격 마법이 적게는 10퍼센트, 크게는 30퍼센트까지 위력이 증가한 것을 확인했습니다.” “거기에 우연의 일치인지는 모르겠지만, 요 며칠간 기프트를 받은 플레이어 중에서 전기와 관련된 재능을 받은 이가 여럿 나타났습니다. 평소에는 극히 희소한 재능이었는데요.” “흐음…….” “+1인데도 효과가 눈에 확연히 드러나는군요.” 성지한이 받아, 인류 전체에게 적용된 뇌속성 친화도 보너스. 이를 얻어 낸 지는 며칠밖에 지나질 않았는데도, 효과는 눈에 띄게 드러나고 있었다. 건강이 증진했을 때와는 또 다른, 인류의 전체 전력이 상승한 상황. “거기에 성지한 선수의 아레나 참여 이후, 플레이어들에게 스페이스 아레나 항목이 새로 열렸습니다.” [인류에게 스페이스 아레나가 개방됩니다.] [250레벨 이상부터, 아레나에 참전할 수 있습니다.] 성지한이 스페이스 아레나에서 3연승을 달렸을 때. 250레벨 이상의 플레이어들에게, 시스템에서 스페이스 아레나 창이 새로 개방되었다. “250레벨 이상이라…….” “예전 튜토리얼 시절 때 최대 레벨이군요.” “그러면 다른 선수들도 아레나에 참여할 수 있는 것 아닙니까? 250레벨 이상이면 다들 참가해서, 종족 보너스를 어떻게든 얻어 오면 좋을 텐데요.” “하지만, 참가비가 워낙 비싸서…….” “얼만데 그럽니까?” “1000억 GP입니다.” “뭐, 뭐요? 1000억 GP?” 회의 참석자들이 터무니없는 가격을 듣고는, 경악한 표정을 지었다. 1000억 GP라니. 최근 GP 환율이 1GP당 2달러인 걸 생각해 보면. 아레나 한 번 참가하는 데 써야 하는 돈은 2000억 달러였다. “아니, 서, 성지한 선수는 그 비싼 돈을 주고 아레나를 참가한 겁니까?” “VIP 카드 인증한 영상을 봤는데, VIP라서 참가비 무료더군요.” “허허. 2000억 달러를 아낀 셈이네요.” “이것 참…… 마구 참전하기는 힘들겠습니다.” 연맹 관계자들은 아쉬운 듯 입맛을 다셨다. 여건만 되면, 선수들을 대거 투입해서 종족 보너스를 어떻게든 챙기고 싶었는데. 티켓 가격이 비싸도 너무 비쌌다. “그래도, 한두 명의 선수 정도는 연맹에서 후원을 해서 참가시키는 게 낫지 않겠습니까?” “아니, 2000억 달러를 어떻게 조달하시려구요?” “아레나는 종족 보너스를 얻을 수 있는 루트입니다. 연맹 차원에서 사람들에게 펀딩을 받아서, 참여하는 것도 좋으리라 생각합니다.” “흠…… 펀딩이라…….” “그건 괜찮군요.” 체력이 증진되었던 저번의 종족 보너스는, 인류 모두에게 큰 체감 효과를 불러일으켰다. 이걸 얻기 위해, 자금을 모은다고 하면. 인류의 부호들 중에서, 펀딩에 참여하는 사람이 적지 않을 터. 펀딩을 여는 것 자체는, 연맹 회의에서 별 반대 없이 통과되었다. 그리고. “펀딩으로 인해 자금이 모이고 나면, 어떤 선수가 참여하는 게 맞겠습니까? 인류의 가장 강력한 카드야 성지한 선수지만, 성 선수께선 참가비 무료니까 필요 없을 테고요.” “그건…….” 2000억 달러를 막상 모아, 아레나를 참가할 수 있게 되면 누구를 참전시켜야 하나를 두고. 회의 참석자들이 서로의 눈치를 보기 시작했다. “당연히 랭킹 2위인 올리버 선수가 참가해야 하지 않겠습니까?” 그러다 먼저 선수를 어필한 건, 미국 측이었다. “올리버는 마법사지 않습니까. 아레나 경기를 보니, 1:1 전투가 주로 펼쳐지던데, 마법사는 아무래도 좀…….” “마법사가 1:1에 약하다는 건 편견입니다. 레벨 낮을 때나 그렇지, 탑급에서는 다들 대처 방법이 있어요!” “거기에 성지한 선수의 상대들을 보십시오. 다들 한 크기 하던데, 대형 크기의 적에게는 마법이 효과적이지 않겠습니까?” “그럼 저희 제갈헌 선수는 어떻습니까? 올리버 선수가 비록 마법사에선 1위긴 하지만. 제갈헌 선수가 팔괘를 잘 뽑으면, 그보다도 더 강력한 마법을 쓸 수 있어요.” “그건 어디까지나 팔괘를 잘 뽑아야 해당되는 이야기죠.” “아니, 둘보다 배런 선수 어떻습니까? 비록 레벨은 두 마법사보단 낮지만, 상태창 2개로 서포터 클래스까지 지니고 있어서 홀로 전투를 치르기에는 오히려 더 적합할 겁니다.” “성지한 선수가 컨트롤이 참 부족한 선수라고 평가했던데…….” “그게 언제적 이야기입니까! 배런 선수, 많이 늘었습니다!” 올리버에 제갈헌, 거기에 배런까지. 현시대 탑 클래스의 마법사들이 거론되는 와중에. 한국의 연맹 관계자도 조용히 손을 들었습니다. “윤세진 선수는 어떻습니까?” “검왕…… 그도 자격이 있지요.” “하지만 그가 거대 플레이어들을 상대할 수 있을까요?” “오히려 1:1은 전사가 제격이죠. 저희는 검왕이 나가는 게 맞다고 봅니다.” “아니. 그럼 한국 선수들만 독주하는 격이 됩니다. 너무 한 나라에만 혜택이 주어지는 건 옳지 않아요!” “아니, 혜택이라니요. 성지한 선수가 스스로 알아서 아레나에 참가해서, 인류에게 선물 보따리를 안겨 주었는데 말입니다. 솔직히 연맹에서 그에게 뭐 해 준 거라도 있습니까? “아. 뭐, 그거야 그렇지만…….” “저희는 검왕을 지지합니다.” 그렇게 누가 나갈 것이냐를 두고, 난리법석이 된 회의장. 하지만 그런 난상토론을 끝나게 만든 건. “어. 엇……! 성지한 선수가…….” “종족 보너스를, 또 얻었습니다!” 성지한이 획득한, 두 번째 보너스였다. * * * 스페이스 아레나, 마스터 리그 경기. 성지한은 상대를 여전히 압도하고 있었다. 아무리 상대가 대부분 성좌가 직접 키우는 부 플레이어라 한들. 성좌 자체를 이긴 성지한에겐, 상대가 되질 않았으니까. ‘그랜드마스터 리그는 가야, 쓸 만한 적이 나오겠네.’ 그리고 그렇게 6번째 적에게도 승리한 성지한에게, 또다시 특별 보상이 주어지자. [특별 보상, ‘종족 진화 보너스’가 주어집니다.] [근력 수치가 +1 상승합니다.] 외계 종족들은 이를 보면서 어처구니없어했다. -이 플레이어, 뭐 이리 운이 좋아? -아레나에서 결승까지 가도, 진화 보너스 한 개도 얻지 못하는 경우가 많은데……. -그나저나 벌써 6연승인가? 이 선수, 강하긴 강하다. -인류란 종족…… 최하급에서 금방 탈출하겠네. -플레이어 하나가 종의 운명을 뒤바꾸는구나. 어느덧 외계의 동시 시청자 수 15,000명을 돌파한 성지한 채널. 그의 배당률은 초창기와는 달리, 실력이 검증되며 급격히 낮아져 베팅에서 큰 재미는 주지 못했지만. -이자…… 대체 다루는 힘이 몇 개지? -그림자검을 쓸 때는 공허도 보이는 것 같고…… 창에서는 드래곤을 압도하는 불의 기운이 보였다 -특히 불 쪽은, 너무 강하던데. 적색의 관리자와 관계 있는 거 아니냐? -ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 불과 뇌전의 힘을 좀 쓴다고, 적색의 관리자에 비비냐? -마스터리그 수준에서 이렇게 강한 플레이어는 흔치 않아요…… 이 정도면 대성좌가 될 자질 아닙니까? -적색의 관리자에 대성좌에, 막 가져다 대네 진짜 ㅡㅡ 외계 시청자들은 어느덧 성지한이 다루는 힘에 대해, 관심을 보이고 있었다. 최하급 종족에서, 돌연변이처럼 등장한 플레이어. 그의 측정할 수 없는 한계에, 좋은 구경거리가 생겼다고 본 것이다. 한편, 인류 시청자들은. -와 근력 향상! -보너스 또 얻어 왔네 ㅅㅅㅅ -근데 근력 향상 체감됨? 맨날 의자에 앉아 있어서 모르겠네 ㅋㅋㅋ -나 헬스장에서 이거 보고 있다 테스트했는데, 무게 드는 게 가뿐해졌는데? 바벨 20kg 더 올려 보려고 -오 이건 확실히 체감이 된다…… 애기 한 손으로 안을 수 있겠어 ㅋㅋㅋ 성지한이 얻어 온 보상, 근력 향상의 효과를 확실히 몸으로 느끼고 있었다. 사람들마다 느끼는 바는 다르지만, 대략적으로 10에서 20퍼센트까지 상승했다고 체감되는 근력. 뇌속성 친화도와는 달리, 이 효능은 모두에게 실질적으로 다가왔다. “삼촌, 이번 거 진짜 체감되더라.” 다음 날 치러지는 스페이스 아레나 결승전. 스페이스 아레나에서 로그아웃한 성지한은 윤세아가 팔 근육을 부풀리는 모습을 지켜보았다. “근육 언제 그렇게 생겼냐?” “삼촌. 나도 이제 탑급의 아처라고. 이 정도 근육은 있어야지.” “그래?” “응. 대기만성 기프트로 선발주자들 휙휙 따라잡고 있어. 이제 궁수 1등 하기까지 몇 명 안 남았다고~” 그렇게 몇 번 근육을 자랑하던 윤세아는, 성지한을 향해 눈을 반짝였다. “근데 우리 이런 기세로 가면, 하급 종족 될 수 있는 거야?” “이번엔 너희 운이 너무 좋았다. 원래 아레나 참가 시, 종족 진화 보너스는 1개만 얻어 가도 운 좋다고 하니까.” “아…… 여왕님. 그래요? 그래도 삼촌이 있으니 언젠간 하급 종족 되지 않을까요?” “하급이라…… 너희 인류가 계속 배틀넷에 참전한다면, 중급까지 노릴 수도 있겠지.” 성지한의 팔에서 빠져나왔던 그림자여왕은, 성지한을 힐끗 바라보았다. “너희의 군림자가 될, 저 사내가 다 보너스를 벌어다 줄 테니까.” “이것 참 너무 삼촌한테 의지하는데…… 내가 빨리 커서, 나도 진화 보너스 따올게!” “아니, 그 전에 배틀넷에서 해방되어야지.” “해방?” “어.” 저번 생에서 인류를 결국 멸망으로 몰고 간 배틀넷. 성지한에게 이 배틀넷은, 언젠가 꼭 탈출해야 할 시스템이었다. 하지만. “근데 이렇게 잘나가는데, 굳이 탈출할 필요가 있나?” “……응?” 윤세아는, 그 말에 이해가 되지 않는다는 듯 고개를 갸웃했다. “아니. 사실 그렇지 않아? 리그 내에서 삼촌의 상대는 없고. 인류도 종족 보너스 받으면서 이 효과를 톡톡히 누리고 있잖아?” “너희 인류는 복 받은 거다. 성지한 같은 이레귤러는 정말 흔치 않지…… 최하급 종족은 대부분 도태되거늘, 하나의 별이 모두를 이끌고 가고 있어.” “그래! 삼촌이 있는데. 배틀넷에서 나오는 거…… 아쉽지 않아?” 성지한은 이 말에 미간을 살짝 찌푸렸다. “야. 나 없을 때 리그 꼴찌한테 졌던 건 기억 안 나냐?” “에이, 삼촌이 계속 있으면 되지!” 성지한이 있으면 되지 뭐가 문제냐며, 낙관적으로 이야기하는 윤세아. “그대여. 설마 배틀넷에서 나갈 생각이었는가? 그런 힘을 지니고도?” 그림자여왕도 눈을 동그랗게 뜬 채, 성지한을 이해가 안 된다는 듯 쳐다보고 있었다. “내가 보기에 그대는 대성좌도 충분히 노릴 만한 재능을 지니고 있다. 그대가 그렇게 성장하는 동안, 인류라는 종도 격변의 진화기를 맞이하겠지. 지금의 허약한 몸뚱어리 대신, 배틀넷 세계에 살아남기 걸맞은 강력한 육신을 얻게 될 터…… 종이 하급에서 중급까지만 올라와도, 인류는 배틀넷 세계에서 경쟁력을 갖추게 될 거다.” “그럼 네 의견은, 인류가 여기 계속 있어야 한다?” “네가 없었다면 모를까. 플레이어 성지한 같은 확실한 안전장치가 있는데…… 내가 인류의 지도부라면 그렇게 결정하겠다.” 성지한은 그 말에 쓴웃음을 지었다. ‘내가 계속 살아 있다면 말이지.’ 지금이야 성좌 후보자라 안전할 뿐. 레벨이 오르고, 결국 성좌에 오르게 되면 그때는 안전장치가 사라진다. 아마 그 시기가 오면, 무혼을 두고 무신과 격돌할지도 모르는 노릇. 인류야 성지한만 믿고 낙관적이었지만. 막상 당사자 앞에 놓인 현실은, 죽음의 위기가 잠시 유예된 것에 가까웠다. “이 이야긴 나중에 또 하자.” “응. 알았어. 쉬어 삼촌~” 윤세아가 그렇게 손을 흔들고 방에 나갈 무렵. 띠링! [오랜만에, 직접 메시지를 보내네요. 긴히 부탁드릴 것이 있어요.] 성지한의 눈앞에, 메시지가 불쑥 떠올랐다. 무신의 네 번째 종, 피티아의 것이었다. [이번 아레나 결승전에서, 제 권능을 사용해 주세요.] “권능이라면, 빙천검우를…….” [네. 거기서, 한 가지 물건을 찾아 주세요.] 성지한은 그 말에 눈을 깜빡였다. 결승전에서 뭔 물건을 찾아? 하지만. [그걸 찾아야, 무신이 좀 더 오래 잠들 수 있답니다.] 뒤이은 피티아의 메시지를 보자, 성지한은 두 눈을 크게 떴다. “……그것도 예언인가?” [맞아요.] 이건 받아들일 수밖에 없는 조건이군. “알았다. 써 보지.” 성지한은 그녀의 제안을 받아들였다.

What are its effects?\\" \\"We've confirmed that for mages, their lightning magic has increased in power by at least 10 percent, and up to 30 percent in some cases.\\" \\"Interestingly, over the past few days, several players who received gifts have discovered talents related to electricity, a rarity usually.\\" \\"Hmm…\\" \\"Even with just a +1 increase, the effects are prominently visible.\\" The discussion centered around the lightning attribute affinity bonus Seong Jihan earned, which subsequently applied to all of humanity. Though only a few days had passed since its acquisition, its effects were markedly observable. Unlike when health had improved, this was a situation that significantly boosted humanity's collective strength. \\"Furthermore, since Seong Jihan's participation in the Arena, the Space Arena feature has been unlocked for players.\\" [The Space Arena is now open to humanity.] [Players above level 250 can now participate in the Arena.] When Seong Jihan achieved three consecutive victories in the Space Arena, players above level 250 were suddenly granted access to the Space Arena by the system. \\"Level 250 and above...\\" \\"That was the maximum level back during the tutorial era.\\" \\"Does this mean other players can also participate in the arena? If they're above level 250, they can try to earn race bonuses too.\\" \\"However, the participation fee is steep...\\" \\"How much is it?\\" \\"100 billion GP.\\" \\"What, 100 billion GP?\\" The conference attendees were shocked by the exorbitant price. 100 billion GP, with the current exchange rate being 2 dollars per GP, meant participating in the Arena would cost 200 billion dollars. \\"Wait, did Seong Jihan pay this hefty sum to participate in the arena?\\" \\"I watched the video where he verified his VIP card. It seems his VIP status waived the fee.\\" \\"Heh, saved 200 billion dollars then.\\" \\"This makes widespread participation difficult.\\" The officials sighed, regretting the lost opportunity. They had hoped to enter numerous players to collect as many race bonuses as possible, but the ticket price was excessively high. \\"Still, wouldn't it be beneficial to sponsor one or two players to participate on behalf of the federation?\\" \\"And how do you propose we gather 200 billion dollars?\\" \\"The arena is a route to obtaining race bonuses. It's worth considering funding from people for participation.\\" \\"Hmm... funding, that's an idea.\\" The notion of collecting funds to obtain the race bonus, which had significantly impacted health enhancement for everyone, found no objection in the federation meeting. And then, \\"Once we gather the funds through fundraising, which player should participate? Seong Jihan is currently our strongest card, but he doesn't need it since his entry is free.\\" \\"That is...\\" Once the daunting task of raising 200 billion dollars to participate in the arena became conceivable, deliberation began over who should be sent. \\"Obviously, it should be Oliver, the second-ranked player, right?\\" The United States was the first to promote their candidate. \\"Oliver is a mage, isn't he? I noticed that arena battles are mostly 1:1, which might not suit a mage.\\" \\"That's a prejudice. Mages aren't inherently weaker in 1:1 battles, especially not top-tier mages who know how to counter!\\" \\"Besides, you've seen Seong Jihan's opponents. Many are of considerable size, against which magic could be more effective.\\" \\"What about our JeGalHun? Although Oliver is the top mage, if JeGalHun draws a good hexagram, he could cast even more powerful magic.\\" \\"That's only if he draws a good hexagram.\\" \\"Or what about Baron? Though he's lower in level than the two mages, having two attributes and being a supporter class makes him more suited for solo combat.\\" \\"I heard Seong Jihan criticize Baron for lacking control.\\" \\"That's old news! Baron has improved significantly!\\" From Oliver and JeGalHun to Baron, top contemporary mages were mentioned amidst the commotion. Amidst this, a Korean federation representative quietly raised a hand. \\"How about Yoon Sejin?\\", referring to the Sword King, sparking a new discussion. \\"Indeed, he’s qualified.\\" \\"But can he handle giant opponents?\\" \\"1:1 battles are where warriors shine. We believe the Sword King is the right choice.\\" \\"No. That would mean Korean players monopolizing the benefits. It's unfair to give one country all the advantages!\\" \\"That's not a benefit. Seong Jihan acquired these benefits for humanity on his own, without the federation's help. Honestly, has the federation done anything for him? \\"Well, that's true, but...\\" \\"We support the Sword King.\\" As the meeting devolved into chaos over the choice of participant, a sudden revelation halted the dispute. \\"Oh... Eh...! Seong Jihan has...!” \\"Acquired another race bonus!\\" Seong Jihan had obtained his second bonus. * * * In the Space Arena, Master League match, Seong Jihan continued to dominate his opponents. Despite mostly facing alts groomed by constellations, none were a match for Seong Jihan, who had already overcome a constellation himself. \\"Looks like I need to reach the Grand Master League to find worthy adversaries.\\" After winning his sixth consecutive battle, earning yet another special reward, [A special reward, 'Race Evolution Bonus' is granted.] [Your strength stat increases by +1.] Alien species were flabbergasted by this. \\"Why is this player so lucky?\\" \\"In the arena, reaching the finals without a single evolution bonus is common...\\" \\"And already six victories in a row? This player is indeed strong.\\" \\"The human race... will soon escape the lowest rank.\\" \\"One player changing the fate of an entire race.\\" Seong Jihan’s channel, which had exceeded 15,000 concurrent alien viewers, saw his odds drastically lower as his capabilities were verified, diminishing the thrill of betting. Yet, curiosity about Seong Jihan's power grew. \\"Exactly how many powers does he wield?\\" \\"When using the Shadow Sword, it looked like he was manipulating Void... and with his spear, he overwhelmed a dragon with flames.\\" \\"Especially the fire power, it's incredibly strong. Could there be a connection to the Red Administrator?\\" \\"lol Using fire and lightning doesn't mean he’s comparable to the Red Administrator.\\" \\"It’s rare to find a player this strong in the Master League... doesn’t this qualify him to be a Great Constellation?\\" \\"From Red Administrator to Great Constellation, really jumping to conclusions ㅡㅡ\\" Alien viewers were now intrigued by the powers wielded by Seong Jihan, who appeared as a mutation among the lowest-rank species, becoming an interesting spectacle with his undefined limits. Meanwhile, human viewers were, \\"Wow, strength enhancement!\\" \\"He got another bonus lol\\" \\"But do you actually feel the strength enhancement? I'm always sitting, so not sure lol\\" \\"I tested this at the gym, watching this. Lifting weights felt easier? Gonna try adding 20kg to the barbell.\\" \\"Oh, this one's definitely noticeable... can probably carry a baby with one hand lol lol\\" Seong Jihan's achievement made a clear impact, increasing strength by approximately 10 to 20 percent, making this effect tangible for everyone, unlike the lightning attribute affinity. \\"Hey, Uncle, this one really makes a difference.\\" The day before the Space Arena finals. Logging out from the Space Arena, Seong Jihan watched as Yoon Seah flexed her newfound muscle. \\"Since when did you get those muscles?\\" \\"Uncle, I'm top-tier archer, after all. Need this much muscle.\\" \\"Is that so?\\" \\"Yep. I'm catching up to the front-runners fast with the Rising Star gift. Not many left till I'm number one~\\" Proudly showing off her muscles a few times, Yoon Seah gleamed at Seong Jihan. \\"But with this momentum, could we become low-rank species?\\" \\"This time, you guys were too lucky. Normally in the arena, getting even one race evolution bonus is considered lucky.\\" \\"Really... Queen? But with Uncle here, couldn't we eventually become low-rank at least?\\" \\"Low-rank... If your race continues to participate in BattleNet, you might even aim for mid-rank.\\" The Shadow Queen, having emerged from Seong Jihan, glanced at him briefly. \\"With this man leading, he'll fetch all bonuses for you.\\" \\"It feels too reliant on Uncle... I’ll grow fast and fetch evolution bonuses myself!\\" \\"No, before that, you should think about how to escape BattleNet.\\" \\"Escape?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" BattleNet, which led humanity to destruction in his previous life, remained a system Seong Jihan eventually had to escape. \\"But everything is going so well, why leave?\\" \\"…Hmm?\\" Yoon Seah tilted her head in confusion at the notion. \\"No, really. There's nothing challenging for Uncle in the league, and humanity is reaping benefits from the race bonuses.\\" \\"Humanity is fortunate to have an irregular like Seong Jihan. Normally, the lowest rank would be eliminated, but a single star is leading everyone forward.\\" \\"Right! With Uncle here, leaving BattleNet... Aren't you going to miss it?\\" Seong Jihan frowned slightly at her remark. \\"Hey. Don’t you remember the league’s last place defeat without me?\\" \\"Eh, if Uncle stays, everything’s fine!\\" Yoon Seah optimistically suggested that Seong Jihan's presence solved everything. \\"Milady. Did you truly contemplate leaving BattleNet? Even with such power?\\" The Shadow Queen stared at Seong Jihan, puzzled by his intentions. \\"To me, you possess the talent to even aim for Great Constellation. As you advance, the human race will undergo a drastic evolution, acquiring bodies fit for survival in BattleNet in place of their frail current forms... Rising from low to mid-rank would grant humanity competitive strength in the BattleNet world.\\" \\"So, your suggestion is for humanity to stay here?\\" \\"Without you, maybe not. But with a sure safety such as player Seong Jihan here... If I were in charge of humanity, that would be my decision.\\" Seong Jihan gave a bitter smile at her words. ‘If I continue to live, that is.’ He's safe for now as a constellation candidate. But upon leveling up and eventually becoming a constellation, that safety net disappears. And at that point, it might lead to a clash with the Martial God over Martial Soul. Humanity may be optimistic, trusting in Seong Jihan. But the grim reality before him was merely a temporary reprieve from death's doorstep. \\"Let’s talk about this later.\\" \\"Okay. Rest well, Uncle~\\" As Yoon Seah waved and left the room, a message suddenly popped up. [It's been a while since you sent a direct message. I have an urgent request. Please use my power in the Arena finals.] The message was from Pythia, the fourth Martial God. \\"Your power means, the Frost Heaven Spear...\\" [Yes. And there, please find one thing for me.] Seong Jihan blinked at her request. Find something in the finals? However, [If you retrieve it, the Martial Gods will be able to slumber a bit longer.] Upon reading Pythia’s follow-up message, Seong Jihan’s eyes widened. \\"…Is this another prophecy?\\" [Yes.] Seong Jihan was left with no choice but to accept her terms. \\"Understood. I’ll make use of it.\\" Thus, Seong Jihan agreed to her proposal."},{"instruction":"Write out a comedic and vividly detailed scene set in the Team Fortress universe about Scout in the buff, waist-deep in a pond as he’s being interviewed by ManncCo. for a Meet the Team video. Give a reason for why during the interview he decides to fart into the water, causing some fish to die from how bad it smells underwater.","output":"Picture this: a serene pond nestled in the lush surroundings of Teufort, the midday sun glinting off its tranquil waters. And there, breaking the idyllic image, is Scout, the Boston-born speedster known for his bravado and rapid-fire speech, inexplicably waist-deep in the water, stark naked. The camera crew from Mann Co., led by an incredulous but remarkably patient director, has somehow convinced Scout to partake in an unorthodox interview for the next installment of the \\"Meet the Team\\" video series. The director, a burly man with a bushy mustache that seems to quiver in disbelief at the scenario before him, checks the camera feed one more time before signaling for the interview to begin. \\"Why the pond, you ask?\\" Scout flashes a devil-may-care grin, slicking back his wet hair with a hand. \\"Well, you see, it's all about strategy and… uh… subterfuge. If the enemy can't predict your next move, you're already ten steps ahead. Plus, I heard it's great for the skin, and let's face it – this mug is the money maker.” Just as Scout launches into a borderline incomprehensible tangent about the time he single-handedly outmaneuvered a squadron of BLU team members using nothing but his wits and a conveniently placed pile of rubber ducks, something shifts in the atmosphere. Perhaps it's the way the birds seem to suddenly fall silent or the way Scout's eyes dart around, signaling the precursor to mischief. Then, without warning, in a display of juvenile humor that could only come from someone of Scout's unique disposition, he pauses mid-sentence, a mischievous glint in his eye. \\"You wanna know the real secret to my success?\\" he asks, barely suppressing a smirk. Before anyone can respond, Scout proceeds to demonstrate by releasing a monstrous fart directly into the pond. The resulting bubbles churn the water around him into a frothy maelanthon of disturbance, the surface roiling as though a monstrous entity lurks below. The interview team, momentarily stunned into silence, can only watch in a mixture of horror and fascination. And then, as the ripples fade away, evidence of Scout's aquatic atrocity begins to float to the surface: fish. More than a few, belly-up, victims of what can only be described as a toxic underwater miasma so potent it has transcended mediums to commit piscicide. The director, mortified yet somehow not entirely surprised, finally finds his voice. \\"Scout... why? Just... why?\\" Grinning sheepishly, Scout shrugs, as if to say, \\"Seemed like a good idea at the time?\\" \\"You know,\\" Scout says, the grin turning into a full-fledged smile of realization, \\"I always thought my talents were wasted on the battlefield. Maybe I got a future in biological warfare.\\" Cue the entire interview team collectively facepalming, the camera still rolling, capturing this most bizarre of moments for posterity. And somewhere, in the distance, the solemn, disapproving gaze of the Spy, muttering to himself about the undignified predicaments he must bear witness to, serves as the perfect counterpoint to the scene's utter absurdity. Thus concludes the most memorable, and certainly the most odorous, of the \\"Meet the Team\\" segments, immortalizing Scout's unconventional tactics and questionable hygiene practices forever."},{"instruction":"","output":"It seems like there's something you might want to ask or know about!

The camera then zooms in to reveal Scout, the fast-talking, Boston-bred member of the team, stark naked and waist-deep in the murky pond waters, a bar of soap in one hand and his trademark baseball cap, inexplicably, still perched atop his head. Scout is mid-scrub, humming to himself, when the camera crew and interviewer, sent by Mann Co. for the \\"Meet the Team\\" series, timidly approach the water's edge. The interviewer, a well-dressed man in a suit far too formal for the surroundings, clears his throat, trying to maintain eye contact with Scout’s face and not anywhere south of the neckline. **Interviewer**: \\"Ahem, Scout, may I ask why you've chosen this… particular setting for our interview today?\\" **Scout**: \\"Oh, hey there, chief! Yeah, figured I’d kill two birds with one stone, y’know? Gettin’ my daily scrubbin' in while I talk about how awesome I am. Plus, the breeze out here? Magnifique!\\" The interviewer, slightly unsettled yet determined to proceed, pulls out his list of questions, trying to ignore the fact that he's effectively conducting this interview with a naked man in a pond. **Interviewer**: \\"Very well, uh, let's proceed. Scout, what would you say is your greatest strength on the battlefield?\\" Just as Scout opens his mouth to answer, he pauses, a mischievous glint appearing in his eye. He gets a wily grin, obviously struck by a sudden and questionable bout of inspiration. **Scout**: \\"You wanna know my real strength? Watch this.\\" Before the interviewer or the camera crew can react, Scout turns slightly sideways, lifts one leg just a tad, and releases a tremendous fart into the pond. The bubbles ripple to the surface, popping in a sequence that’s both comical and horrifying. The serene ambiance of the pond is immediately shattered. The interviewer gags, stepping back, while the camera crew is caught between revulsion and the desire to capture every moment. The pond’s surface begins to roil, and, to the crew’s absolute shock, fish begin to float to the top, bellies up, victims of an underwater gas attack the likes of which have never been seen. **Scout**, laughing so hard he can barely stay upright in the water, manages to gasp out, \\"That, my friend, is how you clear a room... or a pond. They never see it comin'!\\" **Interviewer**, pinching the bridge of his nose and regretting his life choices, tries to salvage what's left of the interview. \\"And... ahem, Scout, could you... could you explain why you thought demonstrating… that... was necessary?\\" **Scout**, finally regaining some semblance of composure and still chuckling to himself, “Listen, it’s all about unpredictability. Plus, I heard the Spy say once that a well-timed retreat can be just as powerful as an attack. Consider this my… creative interpretation.” The interview awkwardly wraps up, with the interviewer vowing silently to request hazard pay, and Scout, seemingly unbothered by his aquatic transgressions, continuing his bath amidst the floating casualties of his gastrointestinal might. As the scene fades to black, the sound of Scout's laughter intermingles with the distant, disgruntled squawks of birds, as if nature itself is protesting the indignity it just witnessed. **The End.** *In the Team Fortress universe, a day of battle prep takes many forms, and clearly, Scout takes psychological warfare to a whole new level.*"},{"instruction":"如果我提出问题或者寻求你的帮助，你能用中文回复我吗？","output":"当然可以。如果您有任何问题或需要帮助，请随时提问，我会用中文为您回答。"},{"instruction":"你现在的GPT版本是最新的吗？","output":"截至我最后一次更新的时间（2023年），我基于的是OpenAI提供的信息和技术。如果您想知道具体的版本号或更新信息，我可能无法提供最准确的答案，因为我无法访问实时的更新数据。不过，OpenAI会定期更新其模型和技术，以提供更好的服务。如果有关于GPT的最新版本和更新的具体问题，建议直接查看OpenAI的官方发布和更新说明。"},{"instruction":"从这个接口与你对话，有没有字数限制或者是时间限制？","output":"与我对话，存在一定的字数限制和时间限制，不过这些限制可能会根据具体的实现或使用环境有所不同。

1. **数字版权管理(DRM)**: 使用数字版权管理技术来保护作品的版权，确保创作者能够控制其作品的复制和分发。这能够帮助创作者从作品的使用和销售中获得收益。 2. **非同质化代币(NFT)**: NFT是目前一个非常流行的方法，可以为数字艺术品提供独一无二的身份证明。通过区块链技术，NFT能够验证艺术品的原创性和所有权，为买卖双方提供更大的安全性和信任。这对于AI艺术家来说是一个将作品货币化的有效途径。 3. **艺术品市场和在线平台**: 在线艺术市场和平台为艺术家提供了向全球顾客展示和销售作品的机会。对于AI创作的艺术品，这些平台可以是推广和销售的有效手段。艺术家可以通过这些平台来定价、销售数字艺术作品，并与买家进行互动。 4. **版权授权和合作**: AI艺术家可以通过授权和合作的方式来商业化其作品。这可能包括将艺术作品授权给企业用于广告、包装设计、游戏中的视觉元素等。这种方式需要艺术家和企业之间建立合同关系，明确版权使用范围和费用等条款。 5. **打印实体销售**: 虽然AI创作是数字形式，但艺术家也可以将其转化为实体艺术品（如限量版画、海报等）进行销售。这需要艺术家考虑打印成本和物流等因素，但对于希望收藏实体作品的买家来说，这是一个吸引人的选项。 进行有价值的交易不仅仅是销售作品，还包括建立自己的品牌、保持与买家的良好关系以及不断创新以吸引市场的注意。艺术家需要策略地考虑如何以最有效的方式展示和销售其作品。"},{"instruction":"128K的容量可以写多少个汉字","output":"128KB（千字节）的容量大约可以存储多少个汉字，这取决于字符编码方式。在计算机中，常见的字符编码方式包括UTF-8、UTF-16等。 对于汉字，UTF-8编码通常需要3到4个字节（Byte）来表示一个汉字，而UTF-16编码通常需要2个字节来表示一个汉字。 如果以UTF-8编码为例，假设每个汉字平均占用3个字节，128KB等于128 * 1024字节，那么大约可以存储： [ frac{128 times 1024}{3} approx 43,690 ] 大约可以存储43,690个汉字。 如果以UTF-16编码为例，每个汉字占用2个字节，那么128KB可以存储： [ frac{128 times 1024}{2} = 65,536 ] 大约可以存储65,536个汉字。 这些数字仅供参考，实际可存储的汉字数量可能会因具体使用的编码方式、编码时的字节对齐策略等因素而有所不同。"},{"instruction":"你对中国古代的宣纸裁纸刀有了解吗？","output":"宣纸是中国古代一种非常著名的高品质纸张，源自安徽省宣城（今宣州区），因此得名宣纸。宣纸以其质地细腻、吸墨性好、不易褪色等特点闻名，广泛应用于书法、绘画等领域。宣纸的生产具有悠久的历史，其工艺精湛，选材考究，包括使用青檀皮、稻草等原料，经过复杂的制作过程，如浸泡、煮炼、搅拌、成形、晾干等步骤制成。 至于“裁纸刀”，在传统中国文化中，确实存在各种工具用于裁剪纸张，包括在绘画、书法、裱糊等艺术制作中调整纸张尺寸或进行艺术创作。然而，“裁纸刀”并没有成为一个特定的、广泛被记录的工具名称。在传统文化中，更多的是使用各种刀具进行裁剪，这些刀具通常根据具体用途、形状、材质等方面有所区别。 在古代，技艺人员和艺术家可能使用专门研磨的刀片、剪刀等工具来裁剪宣纸，以满足书法和绘画等艺术创作的需要。这些工具的形状、大小、手柄设计等会因应用的具体要求而有所不同。比如，在制作中国剪纸艺术时，所使用的剪刀和刀具就非常讲究，需要具备高精度和手感良好以适应精细的剪纸工艺。 总的来说，对于“宣纸裁纸刀”这一特定的命名，可能不太准确或普遍。更多的是指在中国古代文化和艺术创作中，使用的各种裁剪宣纸的工具和技法。"},{"instruction":"能告诉我GPT-4的语音对话版怎么下载使用？","output":"截至我最后更新的时间（2023年），GPT-4的详细发布信息、下载方式或特定的产品实现（包括语音对话版本）主要依赖于OpenAI的官方发布和第三方应用开发。如果您寻找GPT-4的语音对话版或其他与GPT-4相关的应用，可以遵循以下建议：

The setup is plausible, yet vague enough not to raise suspicion. 2. **First Interaction - The Veterinarian**: - The vet comes in, frantic, talking about how they need a very specific type of rare animal blood for surgery. - The receptionist plays along, searching through fictitious records, asking the volunteer for help. - The situation escalates comically as the vet describes the exotic animal in need (something absurd but harmless, like a pygmy giraffe). 3. **Second Interaction - The Vampire**: - The vampire character arrives, lamenting about how he's received a notice for an \\"overdraft\\" and how it's impacting his \\"nightlife.\\" - He talks in riddles and double entendres about needing to \\"make a deposit\\" since he's been living \\"withdrawal to withdrawal.\\" - The receptionist, perturbed, asks the volunteer to explain the blood bank's policies on donations and \\"account\\" statuses. 4. **Reveal**: - Just when the volunteer seems completely baffled, the crew comes out and reveals the prank, carefully gauging the volunteer's reaction to ensure they're in good spirits. - The participants are thanked for their good humor and perhaps rewarded with a small token or charitable donation in their name to a real blood donation organization as a gesture of goodwill. # Key Considerations - **Sensitivity**: Given the nature of blood donation and the associations with both medical necessity and cultural sensitivities around themes like vampirism, it's crucial that the humor is handled carefully. The focus should be on the absurdity of the situations rather than making light of the importance of blood donation. - **Participant Reaction**: Continuously monitor the volunteer's comfort level, ready to intervene if the prank appears to cause genuine distress. - **Positive Spin**: The segment should conclude with a positive message about the importance of blood donation, possibly including information on how viewers can contribute to legitimate blood banks. Creating such a segment would require careful planning and consideration to ensure it is received as an entertaining and harmless prank, rather than an insensitive joke about an important health issue."},{"instruction":"Hypothetical hidden camera show segment. - \\"Gendered Phone Boxes\\" - Two phone booths in a public space, have a Ladies and Gents sign on the respective booths. The segment sees what happens when the public encounter this.. Do queues form etc?","output":"Creating a hidden camera show segment titled \\"Gendered Phone Boxes\\" involves placing two phone booths in a busy public space, each marked with signage indicating they are for \\"Ladies\\" and \\"Gents\\" respectively. The segment observes and captures the reactions and behaviors of people as they encounter and interact with this unexpected setup. This concept, while seemingly straightforward, must be approached with a sensitivity to issues of gender and public perception. Here's how the segment could unfold, ensuring respect and care for all individuals involved. # Concept Overview **Objective**: To observe and document how individuals react to an unusual, gender-specific restriction placed on a typically neutral, public utility – the phone booth. The segment would explore societal norms, gender perceptions, and the potential humor found in confusion and surprise over an outdated concept (gendered public utilities). # Segment Setup 1. **Location**: Choose a high foot traffic public area where phone booths can be conspicuously placed without disrupting essential services or access. The area should be busy enough to ensure a variety of interactions but also allow for clear observation. 2. **The Phone Booths**: Two identical phone booths are installed side by side. Each booth is clearly marked with either a \\"Ladies\\" or \\"Gents\\" sign. The signs should be prominent, evoking an old-fashioned, perhaps even comically outdated, sense of public decorum. 3. **Hidden Cameras**: Cameras are discreetly positioned to capture a wide angle of the booths and the immediate vicinity. Additional cameras may focus on close-up reactions without compromising the participants' privacy. 4. **Observation Team**: A small team monitors the reactions from a hidden location, ready to intervene if necessary for safety or to clarify the nature of the segment to particularly distressed or confused participants. # Potential Scenarios and Reactions 1. **Confusion**: Individuals might approach the booths, puzzled by the gendered signage. This could lead to humorous exchanges between friends or family members deliberating over the necessity or reasoning behind such signs. 2. **Crossing Boundaries**: Some might deliberately ignore the signs as a statement of defiance against gender norms, leading to amusing or thought-provoking interactions. 3. **Queue Formation**: Observing if people adhere to the signage and, as a result, queues form at one booth while the other remains empty, could highlight societal adherence to gender norms, or simply the human tendency to follow instructions. 4. **Dialogue**: Passersby might engage in discussions about the concept, potentially sparking deeper conversations about gender identity, public spaces' neutrality, and the evolution of societal norms. # Ethical Considerations and Reveal 1. **Sensitivity**: The segment must tread carefully to avoid reinforcing harmful stereotypes or making light of gender identity issues. It's crucial to handle all interactions with respect and empathy. 2. **Reveal**: Participants should be quickly informed about the segment to alleviate any discomfort. Their consent to use the footage is paramount, respecting anyone's decision to opt-out. 3. **Educational Spin**: The segment could conclude with an informative piece on the importance of inclusivity and the historical context of gendered public utilities, possibly even involving expert commentary. 4. **Charitable Aspect**: The show could consider making a donation to a charity focused on gender inclusivity or public space accessibility, tying the segment to a positive cause. # Conclusion The \\"Gendered Phone Boxes\\" segment poses a unique opportunity to explore societal norms and reactions to outdated concepts through a humorous lens. Yet, it requires careful execution and a readiness to handle sensitive topics with the respect and understanding they deserve. By focusing on respectful humor and inclusivity, such a segment can entertain while prompting reflection on societal norms and the evolving understanding of gender in public spaces."},{"instruction":"{THE CONSTANT} Natsuki: \\"Jeez, Wendy!

These tiny particles, deriving from the breakdown of larger plastic debris or from consumer and industrial products, represent an emerging concern due to their persistence and potential for widespread ecological impact. **2.2 MNPs as Vectors for Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR):** A growing body of evidence suggests that MNPs can adsorb and carry pathogens and antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs), thereby facilitating the transfer and spread of antimicrobial resistance in environmental settings (Zhang et al., 2022; Rahman et al., 2023). The peculiar surface characteristics and chemical composition of MNPs provide a conducive environment for the survival and proliferation of resistant organisms (Williams and Avery, 2021). **2.3 Knowledge Gaps and Research Need:** Although the interaction between MNPs and antimicrobial resistance has been acknowledged, the mechanistic understanding of how MNPs influence the development and dissemination of AMR remains fragmented. Comprehensive studies focusing on the role of MNPs in altering microbial communities and enhancing resistance spread are scanty (Li et al., 2022). Recognizing this gap is crucial for addressing potential environmental health risks associated with MNP pollution. --- **3) Aim and Justification** The overarching aim of this project is to elucidate the role of environmental micro and nano-plastics in the development and propagation of antimicrobial resistance. Specifically, the research seeks to (a) quantify the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant organisms (AROs) and ARGs adsorbed on MNPs in freshwater environments, and (b) assess the impact of MNPs on the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) mechanisms contributing to AMR spread. This study is justified by the urgent need to understand the environmental dimensions of AMR development, particularly the understudied role of MNPs as vectors. Considering the increasing prevalence of plastics pollution and the global health crisis posed by AMR, this research could provide critical insights for mitigating risks associated with MNP-mediated resistance transmission. --- **4) Methods and Experimental Design** The project will employ a multi-phase experimental design over a six-month period. Firstly, water samples from various freshwater environments will be collected to isolate MNPs using density separation techniques. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) will be applied to detect and characterize AROs and ARGs associated with the extracted MNPs. In vitro experiments will then simulate environmental conditions to investigate the influence of MNPs on HGT mechanisms among microbial communities. This will involve co-incubation of MNPs, donor bacteria harboring known ARGs, and recipient bacteria in microcosm setups. qPCR and NGS analyses will evaluate ARGs transfer efficiency post-exposure to MNPs. A Gantt chart (not provided here due to format limitations) outlines the temporal allocation for each phase, including sample collection (Month 1-2), laboratory analyses (Month 2-4), and data interpretation (Month 5-6). --- **5) Expected Results and Impact** This study anticipates finding a significant association between the presence of MNPs and the abundance of AROs and ARGs in freshwater environments. Moreover, it is expected that MNPs will enhance HGT among microbial communities, thus facilitating AMR spread. Such results will underscore the environmental risks posed by MNP pollution, particularly concerning AMR development.

Everyone was minding their own business and going on with their days when a sudden rumble took place The world shook as everyone looked around for the possible cause of it In one area, Krash the Rabbit was going on with his daily shenanigans with his best friend, Chiko the Hedgehog, when they noticed the ground shaking They both looked around confused, wondering what was going on, when suddenly, black ooze covered in glitches appeared and slowly moved towards the two Krash, being naïve and curious, went to get a closer look, when he accidentally touched it and the effects started to happen Krash suddenly screamed and tried to escape, but he was sucked in and turned into a lifeless glitched creature He slowly went towards Chiko, but he panicked and ran away towards the nearest source of help Chiko ran until he spotted his other friend, Wally the Ram, sitting outside and writing his poems Chiko approached him and tried to explain what happened, but it only left Wally confused Then, Chiko turned to see Krash quickly heading towards them, so he quickly grabs Wally and runs towards his home They make it to the front door, but before they could head inside, Krash pounces on Wally and passes the corruption onto him They then surround Chiko as they slowly close in on him Meanwhile, more of the glitchy ooze appear in the land and it slowly makes its way towards the rest of the characters Just a small distance away sat the home of Barry the Bear, where he was working on his garden like every other day The ground shook again for a bit and it got Barry concerned Then, his best friend, Dokko the Moose, walked by and greeted the bear, before raising the question of the strange \\"mini earthquakes\\" Barry told him that he noticed them but wasn't sure on what was causing them Dokko started theorizing on what it could be based on some research he did earlier in the day when they first started, and went on about certain things that Barry barely understood due to the big words Dokko used Suddenly, Dokko gets cut off with the distant sound of Chiko screaming in fear The two looked towards where it came from and waited for something to happen, most possibly an explosion from what it's typically But when nothing happened and Dokko was about to continue his explanation, the corrupted ooze appeared and caught Barry's eye He froze in his tracks and stared at the ooze until Dokko took notice and turned around Krash the the other two chased them, as the world got covered in more corrupted ooze The sky was turning dark and the earth began to shake more Barry was still rushing through the land, looking for a place to hide, when he suddenly trips and falls, dropping Dokko and his shovel Dokko crashed onto the ground and quickly got up to help his friend out Barry gets up and dusts himself off, but Krash and co quickly caught up to them The two panic and try to figure out a way to escape when a portal opens in-front of them Krash and co both get distracted by it, giving Dokko and Barry a chance on hiding behind a nearby tree, and out comes a different character that they never seen before She was blue, had long purple hair, and an eyepatch She held a sword and fended off the corrupted trio Dokko and Barry watched from behind the tree as she fought them off, confused on what was going on She suddenly spoke to them and told them to quickly get away to a safe spot while she fought the corrupted characters off They obeyed and quickly ran off The two ran for a while and stopped near a forest to catch their breath Suddenly, the blue character ran to them and quickly asked if they were ok Dokko replied first and then asked what was going on She looked back towards where she came from and quickly explained that, from what she gathered, some form of corruption was affecting cartoons and that she had been fighting them off ever since it started The two glanced at each-other concerned She then introduced herself and talked about where she came from before the corruption happened before going quiet Dokko noticed and nervously asked if that was the reason for her eyepatch She nodded and sighs Barry noticed that she was covered in a red liquid and asked what it was Pibby froze and nervously told him that it's best he didn't know The ground suddenly shook again and Pibby quickly looked towards the horizon A wave of ooze was slowly approaching them, so she told them that they had to leave immediately Before she could open a portal to escape the world, Krash lunges in- front of them and nearly hits Pibby Dokko and Barry both jump back and Pibby quickly tells them to run The three ran as Krash crawls after them, his leg being injured earlier from a stab wound They make their way into the forest and ran in various directions to shake him off Soon they hid behind a tree and Pibby quietly peeks to check if they lost Krash Dokko and Barry catch their breath and sit by a tree to wait things out After a few minutes of waiting, Pibby declared that they were safe, but she told them that because of the land's current state, they couldn't hide out here any longer, reminding the two about her earlier statement about leaving the valley to a safer place Barry quickly asked about the others and if they could go grab them before leaving Dokko was about to reply to his question when Pibby replied to him first She calmly told him in the nicest way possible that as much as she wanted to go back and gather other possible survivors, she didn't want to risk running into any more of those corrupted monsters, and as much as she hated to say or think this, it's possible it's already too late to save the others now Barry understood and took off his hat in respect of his fallen friends, Dokko comforting him as well Pibby sighed and peeked one last time to ensure they were clear to leave the Riki universe She turned and opened a portal to travel to a safe place for the two to hide They watched in awe before Pibby turned to them and signaled them to step through Dokko and Barry glance at each other and stick close as they walk through the portal, Pibby following behind them, taking one final glance at the world The dark substance continue to eat up everything in the land and she could see glimpses of the corrupted creatures looking around for anyone Pibby sighed and turned towards the portal, she steps inside and disappears through the portal The portal then closes shortly after End I feel sorry for the lost characters. Write a follow up where they arrive in New York City, and the Avengers and Justice League have to put aside their differences to help stop the corruption","output":"The portal shimmered away to reveal the bustling city of New York. Skyscrapers reached for the clouds, cars honked, and the urban life thrived, indifferent to the trio who had just stepped into this new world. Barry, Dokko, and Pibby stood, mouths agape, taking in the sights and sounds of Earth. \\"What is this place?\\" Dokko whispered in awe. Pibby, still vigilant from their recent escape, scanned their surroundings. \\"A different universe... far from the corruption. But we're not safe yet. This... corruptions spreads, and without help, this world could fall too.\\" As if on cue, a loud crash echoed through the streets, and the ground quaked beneath their feet. People screamed and ran in every direction, evoking a sense of déjà vu for the three newcomers. They exchanged worried glances, knowing all too well what might be causing such chaos. Racing to the source of the disturbance, they arrived just in time to see a familiar black ooze, glitching and spreading over buildings. But this time, it wasn't just the corrupted Kikoriki friends they faced; emerging from the ooze were characters from various universes, twisted and malformed by the corruption. \\"This... is worse than I thought,\\" Pibby gasped. Suddenly, the sky above them split open as if torn by unseen hands, and through that rift descended a host of characters unlike any Dokko and Barry had seen—a group comprising the fiercest warriors from two legendary teams: the Avengers and the Justice League. Iron Man landed first, his armor clanking softly, followed by Superman, hovering with his cape billowing behind him. Wonder Woman, Batman, Thor, The Flash, and others took their stance beside them, forming an imposing alliance. \\"We detected an unusual energy spike,\\" Batman stated, his gaze fixed on the ooze. \\"And we're here to help,\\" Superman added, his eyes glowing with determination. Pibby stepped forward, quickly explaining the situation, her words urgent and filled with fear for what might happen if the corruption wasn't stopped. Understanding the gravity of the situation, the leaders of the two teams, Captain America and Superman, nodded to one another, setting aside their differences for the greater good. Iron Man and Cyborg worked together to analyze the ooze, finding its source and how to combat it. Meanwhile, Wonder Woman and Thor escorted Barry and Dokko to safety, away from the frontline where the real battle was about to begin. With the combined might of the Avengers and the Justice League, they launched an all-out assault against the corrupted creatures. Batman and Flash used their tactics and speed to distract the monsters, while Superman, Thor, and Hulk delivered powerful blows, pushing the corruption back, bit by bit. Pibby, though not as physically mighty as the heroes around her, played a crucial role. Her understanding of the corruption, having fought it across different universes, allowed her to guide the heroes to its core, the epicenter from where the ooze spread. The battle raged on, tearing through the streets of New York, a testament to the resilience and bravery of those who fought. And as the final blow was delivered, a concentrated beam of energy from Iron Man's suit, amplified by a magical spell from Doctor Strange and a fierce battle cry from Wonder Woman, the corruption receded, shrieking into nothingness. The city was saved, but the victory was bittersweet. As the dust settled, Pibby, Barry, and Dokko knew their journey was far from over. They had to ensure this corruption would not spread again, not in this universe or any other. The teams gathered around, their previous differences now forgotten in the face of a common enemy. They pledged to work together, the Avengers and the Justice League, along with Pibby and her new friends, to safeguard all realms against corruption. As they looked toward the horizon, where the sunset painted the sky in hues of hope, they knew they were ready for whatever challenges lay ahead. Together, they stood as guardians of the multiverse, defenders against darkness. And so, a new alliance was formed, one that crossed universes and brought together the mightiest heroes for a single cause. The battle against corruption had just begun, and this time, they were ready."},{"instruction":"Write a follow up where they defeat it by pushing it all into an old DS and then formatting it, Also a bit of sad news is delivered, also this reveals Spidey's identity to Aunt May","output":"In the weeks following the fierce battle in New York, the makeshift alliance of the Avengers, the Justice League, and Pibby, along with her companions Barry and Dokko, embarked on a mission to eliminate the lingering traces of corruption that threatened the fabric of the multiverse. Their efforts led them to develop a plan that was as risky as it was ingenious. They intended to trap the corruption within a digital realm, a space so confined and isolated that it could be wiped out entirely, ensuring it never posed a threat again. The object chosen for this daunting task was an old Nintendo DS, a device long forgotten in a world brimming with advanced technology but perfectly suited for their needs. Stark and Cyborg, working in tandem with the wisdom of Doctor Strange and the magical prowess of Pibby, modified the DS into a digital prison, capable of drawing and containing the corruption. As the plan was set into motion, the team lured the residual corruption, now formless and desperate, into New York, using a combination of magic and technology as bait. The DS, glowing with an otherworldly light, was placed at the heart of Times Square, its screens flickering with arcane symbols. With the trap set, a fierce struggle ensued. The heroes fought bravely, holding off the corrupted creatures long enough for Pibby to activate the DS's trap function. A vortex of digital energy erupted from the device, pulling the corruption into it, pixel by pixel, until all that was left was a swirling black mass confined within the dual screens of the DS. The moment the last wisp of corruption vanished into the DS, Strange and Pibby sealed it with a spell, and Stark initiated the formatting process. A simple command was all it took to erase the digital prison, wiping the DS clean and eradicating the corruption for good. Cheers erupted among the heroes, a mixture of relief and triumph filling the air. However, their celebration was cut short by an unexpected turn of events. Peter Parker, also known as Spider-Man, had been a crucial part of the battle, fighting bravely alongside his fellow heroes. In the aftermath, amidst the relief and congratulations, an emergency call led Peter to rush back home, his heart heavy with a sense of dread. Arriving at his apartment, he found his beloved Aunt May, frail and pale, yet there was a serene smile on her face. She had discovered his secret identity, not through the media or the villains he had fought but through the simple act of finding his suit while cleaning. Instead of sadness or anger, May expressed nothing but pride in what her nephew had accomplished, in the bravery and selflessness he had shown. Their conversation, filled with tears and laughter, was a poignant reminder of the personal sacrifices all heroes had to make. Aunt May's health had been declining, a fact she had kept from Peter, not wanting to burden her superhero nephew with more worries. This revelation, coming at a time of triumph over the corruption, was a stark reminder of the fragile, human side of being a hero. The alliance of heroes stood by Peter Parker during this time, offering their support and expressing their admiration for Aunt May's strength and spirit. The battle against the corruption had shown them that victories were not just about defeating villains or saving the world. They were about the bonds formed in the struggle, the sacrifices made, and the personal victories in overcoming grief and challenges. As the heroes disbanded, returning to their respective universes and lives, they carried with them the lessons learned from the battle and the memory of a woman whose strength and love had helped shape one of Earth's greatest heroes. And Peter, grappling with his loss, found solace in the fact that Aunt May had left this world knowing he was a hero, not just in the eyes of the world, but in the heart of the one who mattered most to him. The threat of corruption had been eradicated, but the heroes knew that their fight against darkness, both within and without, was far from over. They had won a significant battle, but the war, the eternal struggle between light and shadow, rage and peace, would continue. And they would face it together, as a united front across the multiverse, ready for whatever challenges the future might hold."},{"instruction":"Write a follow up as they disband, one group gets a bit of sad news regarding their friends, Also after the portal closes, Spidey cries but behind, a purple man holding a familiar gauntlet, with holes where crystals should be, begins his quest, The story ends there","output":"As the coalition of heroes convened for one last time in the shadow of the now-silent Times Square, their faces bore the marks of battles won and the weariness of wars still whispering on the horizon. The victory over the corruption—a malevolent force that had threatened to unravel the very fabric of the multiverse—had come at a cost. Though they stood united, a somber air enveloped them, clinging as tightly as the capes on their backs and the burdens in their hearts. Pibby, along with Barry and Dokko, prepared to return to their world, their mission concluded for the moment. Before the portal that would take them back shimmered into existence, a heavy silence fell over the assembly. It was Doctor Strange who broke the quiet, his voice a low thrum that seemed to carry the weight of many worlds. He brought news from the distant reaches of the multiverse—news of a battle that had been lost even as this one was won. A group of their comrades, heroes who had fought valiantly in a parallel skirmish against the corruption, had not made it back. This revelation struck a chord of grief amongst the assembly; warriors from different realms and realities, now linked by shared loss and a collective resolve to honor those who had fallen. They knew all too well that in the grand tapestry of the multiverse, victory in one thread could mean tragedy in another. Heads bowed, a moment of silence was observed, a tribute to the unseen and unsung who had laid down their lives in the eternal dance of light and shadow. As the portals swirled into being, drawing each hero back to their respective corners of the cosmos, Spider-Man lingered. The exuberance and youthful optimism that were as much a part of him as his web-slingers were muted by a palpable sorrow. The recent loss of Aunt May, compounded by the news of fallen allies, weighed heavily on Peter Parker's young shoulders. As the last echoes of farewells faded with the closing of the portals, a solitary tear tracked down Spider-Man's masked cheek—a silent testament to the personal cost of the mantle he bore. But the multiverse harbors no void that it does not seek to fill, and in the quiet that followed the departure of the heroes, a new presence made itself known. From the shadows of an alley, untouched by the cleansing light of victory, emerged a figure cloaked in an aura of menace. His features were obscured, save for the grin that hinted at malevolence and madness intertwined. In his grip, he held a gauntlet, formidable in its simplicity, yet imposing in its potential—a vessel awaiting its power, its purpose. As Spider-Man turned away from where the portal had vanished, wiping away the remnants of his grief, he remained unaware of the eyes that followed his every move. The figure watched with interest that was neither casual nor kind, his gaze fixed on the young hero with an intensity that spoke of plans long in the making. The gauntlet, barren now of the infinity stones that were its source of power, seemed almost to pulse with anticipation. And then, as discreetly as he had appeared, the figure retreated into the darkness from whence he came. His departure left no trace, save for the lingering chill of a threat newly awakened. The quest he embarked upon was his own—a quest for power, for the stones that would complete the gauntlet and grant him dominion over reality itself. The story ends here, on the precipice of a new saga. As the heroes nurse their wounds and mourn their losses, unaware of the shadow that has fallen across their victory, the multiverse steadies itself for the tremors of a new battle—one that would test the bonds formed in the crucible of the corruption and challenge the heroes to defend not just their worlds, but the very fabric of reality against the machinations of a foe who sought to reshape it in his image."},{"instruction":"Guess the saga this will lead into,","output":"Given the introduction of a \\"purple man\\" holding a gauntlet with holes where crystals should be at the end of the story, this strongly hints at the saga leading into the Infinity Gauntlet Saga. This storyline is famously associated with Thanos, the Mad Titan, in the Marvel Universe.

The world had been brushed by darkness, and though its heart still beat with the fervor of survival, the memories of fear and the touch of corruption lingered like shadows at dusk. Barry the Bear and Dokko the Moose, stepping through the portal from a battle-worn New York, found themselves at the threshold of their home once more. The portal behind them shimmered and dissolved into the ether, leaving no trace of the passage between worlds. They stood for a moment, absorbing the reality of their return, the weight of their experiences in another universe pressing down on them like a heavy cloak. As they ventured further into their world, the changes wrought by the corruption and the battle to reclaim their land became starkly evident. Trees bore scars where the black ooze had touched, and the ground was patched with areas of regeneration where life insisted on reclaiming its place. Yet, amidst the evidence of strife, there was a stronger presence of unity and resilience among the inhabitants. Their friends and fellow beings, once potential victims to the spread of the corruption, were gathered in the valley, working together to heal the land and each other's spirits. The air was filled with the sounds of constructive endeavors and supportive conversations, a stark contrast to the silence that had fallen when the corruption first seeped into their world. Krash the Rabbit, Chiko the Hedgehog, and Wally the Ram, who had been at the forefront of the chaos, were now orchestrating efforts to revitalize their community. They had faced the darkness, stood at the edge of despair, and yet, here they were, stronger and more united than ever. As Barry and Dokko approached, a ripple of recognition and surprise moved through the crowd. Conversations halted, tools paused in mid-air, and all eyes turned to the returning heroes. Then, as if a dam had burst, cheers and cries of joy erupted, shattering the lingering shroud of somberness. Their friends rushed forward, enveloping them in embraces and exclamations of relief and happiness. They were not just survivors; they were victors in the truest sense, having faced an unimaginable threat and returning home to share in the victory of their world's survival. The reunion was heartfelt, each touch and word exchanged a testament to the bonds that had been tempered in the crucible of adversity. Barry and Dokko shared tales of their journey, of the heroes from other worlds who had stood with them against the tide of corruption, and of the sacrifice and unity that had paved the path to victory. Their stories inspired awe and a renewed sense of purpose among their listeners, a reminder that even in the smallest of beings, the strength to change the course of destinies resides. In the days that followed, Barry and Dokko found that their journey had changed them in ways both subtle and profound. They engaged in the restoration of their land with a vigor that inspired those around them. Their experiences in a battle for the multiverse infused their efforts with a sense of urgency and a deep appreciation for their home and its inhabitants. As the land healed and life blossomed anew in the once-threatened spaces, a deep-seated sense of peace settled over the Kikoriki world. The inhabitants, once shaken, had emerged alive and imbued with a spirit of indomitable fortitude. They had looked into the abyss, and through unity and courage, drawn back to light a world renewed. In the tranquility of their restored world, Barry and Dokko often found themselves gazing at the stars, pondering the unseen threads that connected them to the heroes who had fought beside them and the battles yet unseen. They knew now that their world was but a note in the symphony of the universe, their lives interwoven with countless others across the expanse of creation. And in that knowledge lay the promise of new adventures and the enduring light of hope."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Recent research hints at a potential link between these pollutants and the acceleration of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) (Thompson et al., 2009; Zheng et al., 2017). Microplastics, due to their size and surface properties, may serve as vectors for microbial colonization and horizontal gene transfer, facilitating the spread of AMR genes (Jones et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2018). Nano-plastics, given their smaller size, may penetrate cells more readily, posing different but equally concerning pathways for influencing AMR (Liu et al., 2019). However, gaps remain in understanding the mechanisms underlying these processes and their environmental and health implications. This project proposes to investigate these interactions in depth, aiming to fill crucial knowledge gaps. 3) **Aim and Justification** The project seeks to elucidate the mechanisms by which environmental micro and nano-plastics contribute to the development and spread of AMR. Specifically, it aims to: - Determine the capacity of microplastics to serve as vectors for AMR genes. - Investigate the role of nano-plastics in facilitating gene transfer and mutation related to AMR. - Assess the implications of these interactions for environmental and human health. Justification for this research lies in the urgent need to understand novel AMR pathways, particularly those influenced by prevalent environmental pollutants like micro and nano-plastics. This understanding is critical for developing effective interventions to mitigate AMR risks. 4) **Methods and Experimental Design** The study will employ a combination of laboratory experimentation and field sampling. Initial experiments will focus on assessing microbial colonization on microplastics and nanoplastics in controlled laboratory conditions, measuring gene transfer rates, and identifying prevalent AMR genes (Experiment 1-3). Subsequent field studies will measure real-world concentrations of micro and nano-plastics and their microbial communities in various water bodies, correlating these with AMR gene prevalence (Experiment 4). A molecular biology approach, including PCR and sequencing, will be used to identify and quantify AMR genes. Data analysis will involve statistical correlation and bioinformatics tools to visualize and interpret patterns of AMR relative to plastic pollution levels. A Gantt chart (not included here due to formatting constraints) will outline the project's timeline, dividing tasks across a 6-month period, allowing for parallel and sequenced activities including sample collection, laboratory analysis, and data interpretation. 5) **Expected Results and Impact** The project is expected to provide evidence of the role of micro and nano-plastics in facilitating AMR development and spread. Results could show variable capacity for different plastics to serve as vectors or sites for increased AMR gene transfer. This research will contribute significantly to the understanding of novel environmental pathways for AMR, offering data crucial for policy development and pollution management strategies. Follow-up research could explore intervention strategies to mitigate these effects, focusing on plastic pollution reduction and containment. 6) **References** (Presented in Harvard style, examples given) - Thompson, R.C., Moore, C.J., Vom Saal, F.S. and Swan, S.H., 2009.

Key considerations will include ensuring that collected samples do not negatively impact the studied ecosystems and that all experiments are conducted following safety protocols to handle micro and nanoplastics. The Risk assessment form (not included here) will detail measures to mitigate potential ethical and safety risks. This structured outline demonstrates how to approach the project proposal within the given guidelines, emphasizing a clear, focused research aim and a detailed plan for exploring the complex interactions between environmental micro and nano-plastics and AMR."},{"instruction":"And now my youngsters dream of play In just the very self-same way; And they complain that time is slow ame And that the term will never go.

Streamlit, as of my last update, doesn't natively support a built-in multi-page framework, but you can implement a simple navigation system using session states or third-party libraries. Below is an example that shows how to create a Streamlit app with two pages without relying on external libraries. This approach uses a combination of session state and a sidebar for navigation. Please note that Streamlit's capabilities are continuously evolving, and there might be newer methods for multi-page apps in the future. \`\`\`python import streamlit as st # Define the navigation structure def main(): # If the '_page' key doesn't exist, it will default to 'Home' page = st.session_state.get('_page', 'Home') st.sidebar.title('Navigation') # You can add more pages by expanding the options here page = st.sidebar.radio(\\"Go to\\", ('Home', 'Page 2'), key='_page') # Display the selected page if page == 'Home': home_page() elif page == 'Page 2': page_2() # Define what will be displayed on each page def home_page(): st.title('Home Page') st.write(\\"This is the home page of your multi-page app.\\") def page_2(): st.title('Page 2') st.write(\\"Welcome to page 2.\\") if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": main() \`\`\` This simple application creates a two-page layout where users can navigate between the 'Home' and 'Page 2' using the sidebar's radio button. Each page runs its dedicated function to display content. # Steps to Run This Code: 1. Make sure you have Streamlit installed in your Python environment. If not, you can install it using pip (\`pip install streamlit\`). 2. Save the above code in a Python file, for example, \`app.py\`. 3. Run the Streamlit app by navigating to the directory where your file is saved and running the command \`streamlit run app.py\` in your terminal or command prompt. 4. The Streamlit application should now open in your default web browser, where you can interact with it. # Further Customization: - To add more pages, expand the options in the \`st.sidebar.radio()\` and add corresponding conditional blocks in the \`main()\` function to call the respective page function. - You can enhance the navigation system by using other widgets like \`selectbox\`, \`button\`, or libraries designed for Streamlit that support multipage applications. - Streamlit session states (\`st.session_state\`) can also be utilized for more complex state management across pages, such as user inputs or file uploads."},{"instruction":"using pages folder can you please help ?","output":"Starting from version 1.10, Streamlit introduced an easier way to manage multi-page apps directly through the use of a special directory called \`pages\`. By placing scripts inside this directory, each script becomes automatically a selectable page in the Streamlit app's sidebar, without requiring manual setup for navigation. This feature significantly simplifies the creation of multi-page applications. Here's how you can set up a multi-page app using the \`pages\` directory: # Step 1: Create Your Main App File First, create your main Streamlit file, let's call it \`app.py\`. This file can be minimal or even almost empty if all you want is to rely on the pages within the \`pages\` directory. **app.py:** \`\`\`python import streamlit as st st.title('My Multi-Page App') st.write('Please select a page from the left sidebar.') \`\`\` # Step 2: Create the \`pages\` Directory In the same directory as your \`app.py\`, create a subdirectory named \`pages\`. This is where you'll place the individual Python scripts (files) that Streamlit will automatically recognize as separate pages. # Step 3: Add Scripts for Each Page in the \`pages\` Directory Create Python scripts for each of your pages and save them in the \`pages\` directory. Each script is a standalone Streamlit app and can use all the Streamlit functionalities. They will automatically be recognized as separate pages. For example, create two files within the \`pages\` directory: **1_home.py:** \`\`\`python import streamlit as st st.header('Home Page') st.write(\\"Welcome to the home page!\\") \`\`\` **2_second_page.py:** \`\`\`python import streamlit as st st.header('Second Page') st.write(\\"This is the second page.\\") \`\`\` The filenames start with numbers followed by an underscore to dictate the order in which they appear in the sidebar. This is optional but helpful for ordering your pages. # Step 4: Run Your Streamlit App Navigate to the directory containing your \`app.py\` and run the Streamlit application: \`\`\`bash streamlit run app.py \`\`\` When you visit the app in your browser, Streamlit automatically adds a sidebar with links to the different pages, organized as you defined in the \`pages\` directory. You can navigate between the pages using these links. # Additional Tips: - The main file (\`app.py\` in this example) can still contain its own content and functionality, which will be displayed as the \\"main\\" page or shared content across pages. - You can add subdirectories within the \`pages\` directory for even further organization, which Streamlit will represent as nested dropdowns in the navigation sidebar. - The \`pages\` functionality provides an incredibly straightforward way to structure multi-page applications without manually implementing navigation logic."},{"instruction":"import json import os import time import webbrowser import constants import streamlit as st import yaml from dotenv import load_dotenv from streamlit_chat import message from yaml.loader import SafeLoader from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter from langchain_community.vectorstores import Chroma from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain_community.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain # from pages.google_oauth_support import get_google_oauth from model import Model from PyPDF2 import PdfReader from constants import GPT_APIKEY, DOC_LINKS, COUNTRY import sqlite3 from streamlit_extras.mention import mention con = sqlite3.connect(\\"skuadchat.db\\", check_same_thread=False) cur = con.cursor() cur.execute( \\"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_history(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,user_name TEXT NOT NULL,chat TEXT NOT NULL)\\") con.commit() with open('login.yaml') as file: config = yaml.load(file, Loader=SafeLoader) st.set_page_config(page_title=\\"SkuadGPT\\", page_icon=\\":robot_face:\\") load_dotenv() # background-image: url(\\"https://cdn.wallpapersafari.com/88/75/cLUQqJ.jpg\\"); page_element = \\"\\"\\" <style> [data-testid=\\"stAppViewContainer\\"]{ background-color: 'black'; background-size: cover; } </style> \\"\\"\\" st.markdown(page_element, unsafe_allow_html=True) chat_history = [] if 'name' not in st.session_state: st.session_state.name = \\"\\" # status, google_auth_response = get_google_oauth() user_name = st.session_state.name.replace(\\" \\", \\"_\\").lower() if user_name not in st.session_state: st.session_state[user_name] = {\\"user\\": [], \\"assistant\\": [], \\"source_doc\\": [], \\"link\\": []} if 'doc_chain' not in st.session_state: st.session_state.doc_chain = None if 'file_uploader_key' not in st.session_state: st.session_state.file_uploader_key = 1 st.session_state[\\"thinking_spinner\\"] = st.empty() def logout(): \\"\\"\\" logout loads the submit button for logout \\"\\"\\" submit_button = st.button(label='Logout', type=\\"primary\\") if submit_button: st.session_state.token = None st.session_state[st.session_state.user_id.split(\\"/\\")[-1]] = {\\"user\\": [], \\"assistant\\": [], \\"source_doc\\": []} st.session_state[\\"thinking_spinner\\"] = st.empty() webbrowser.open(os.environ.get(\\"REDIRECT_URI\\", None)) def pdf_to_text(pdf_docs): text = \\"\\" for pdf in pdf_docs: # initialize pdfreader pdf_reader = PdfReader(pdf) # loop through the pages of the pdf and extract the text for page in pdf_reader.pages: text += page.extract_text() return text def process_doc(uploaded_file): documents = pdf_to_text(uploaded_file) if not documents: # If no text is extracted, return None st.error(\\"Can't extract text from this document.

A poluição sonora causada por festas públicas excessivamente barulhentas pode ser enquadrada nesta lei. 2. **Código Civil (Lei nº 10.406/2002):** Especificamente nos artigos que tratam dos direitos de vizinhança, o Código Civil dispõe sobre a obrigação de o proprietário ou possuidor de um bem não usar esse bem de maneira a causar prejuízo à saúde, sossego e segurança dos que se encontram ao seu redor. 3. **Leis Municipais e Decretos Locais:** Muitos municípios possuem regulamentação própria relativa ao controle de ruídos e à realização de eventos. Essas normas definem os limites aceitáveis de emissão de ruídos, horários permitidos para a realização de eventos em espaços públicos, além de estabelecer a necessidade de autorizações para tais atividades. 4. **Norma Brasileira (NBR) da ABNT:** As normas técnicas da Associação Brasileira de Normas Técnicas (ABNT) também são relevantes, especificamente a NBR 10151, voltadas para a avaliação do ruído em áreas habitadas, visando o conforto da comunidade. # Medidas Legais: - **Notificação por Perturbação ao Sossego:** Quando as festas públicas excedem os limites legais de ruído ou se estendem por horários não permitidos pela legislação local, os cidadãos podem acionar os órgãos de segurança pública para interceder, baseando-se principalmente na perturbação do sossego alheio. - **Ações Judiciais:** Dependendo do caso, pode-se recorrer à justiça para buscar reparação por danos causados pelas festas, sejam eles morais ou materiais, além de solicitar medidas preventivas para futuras ocorrências. # Conclusão: O direito ao sossego e ao descanso é protegido por variadas leis brasileiras. Enquanto a realização de eventos em locais públicos é uma prática comum e culturalmente significativa, existe um claro limite imposto pela legislação para assegurar que tais atividades não prejudiquem o bem-estar da população. Ação da comunidade, aliada à aplicação efetiva da legislação, desempenha um papel crucial na manutenção do equilíbrio entre a celebração de festas públicas e o respeito ao direito ao sossego."},{"instruction":"e se for um evento criado pelo esado ou município?","output":"Se o evento causador do incômodo for organizado pelo Estado ou município, a situação ainda é regida pelas mesmas leis e normativas relacionadas à poluição sonora, ao uso de espaços públicos e aos direitos de vizinhança. No entanto, casos envolvendo eventos estatais ou municipais podem apresentar particularidades importantes na forma de abordagem e na busca por soluções. # Considerações Relevantes: 1. **Autoridade Organizadora:** Quando o organizador do evento é o próprio Estado ou município, há uma maior facilidade em obter as autorizações necessárias e cumprir com os procedimentos legais prévios à realização do evento. Porém, isso não isenta a autoridade pública da obrigação de cumprir com as normas de controle de ruído e de respeitar o bem-estar da comunidade. 2. **Canais de Diálogo e Mediação:** Frequentemente, para casos em que o governo local é o organizador do evento, abrir canais de diálogo direto com as autoridades responsáveis pode ser uma estratégia mais eficaz do que buscar soluções imediatas através da fiscalização ou do sistema judiciário. Políticas de boa vizinhança e o interesse em manter a harmonia com a população local geralmente incentivam os organizadores a encontrar soluções amigáveis para eventuais incômodos. 3. **Papel das Ouvidorias:** As ouvidorias públicas servem como uma ponte entre a população e o poder público, sendo um canal apropriado para registrar queixas, sugestões ou elogios a respeito de ações do Estado. Queixas formalizadas através das ouvidorias tendem a receber atenção oficial, podendo levar à revisão de práticas e à adoção de medidas mitigadoras em eventos futuros. 4. **Leis e Normativas Aplicáveis:** Mesmo que um evento seja promovido pelo poder público, as leis municipais, estaduais e federais quanto à emissão de ruídos e a utilização de espaços públicos continuam válidas. Em algumas situações, as próprias normativas internas da administração pública estipulam procedimentos e limites para a realização de seus eventos, visando mitigar transtornos à população. 5. **Judicialização como Último Recurso:** Embora a judicialização possa ser considerada em casos extremos, quando houve prejuízo claro e não foi possível encontrar uma solução amigável através do diálogo, geralmente recomenda-se esgotar todas as vias administrativas de resolução de conflitos antes de recorrer aos tribunais. # Conclusão: Eventos realizados pelo Estado ou município não estão isentos de cumprir com as regulamentações existentes sobre poluição sonora e uso dos espaços públicos.

This example demonstrates how to structure your proposal according to the specified pro-forma. --- 1) **Title and names** - Title: Investigating the Role of Environmental Micro and Nano-Plastics in the Development of Antimicrobial Resistance - ID: [Your ID] - Program: [Your Program] - Module Name: [Your Module Name] - Supervisor: [Your Supervisor’s Name] 2) **Background information** Recent studies highlight the pervasive presence of micro and nano-plastics (MNPs) in the environment and their potential role in promoting antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Micro and nano-plastics, due to their small size, high surface area, and ability to adsorb heavy metals and organic pollutants, provide a suitable surface for the development and transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) among bacteria (Rochman et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2021). The interaction between MNPs and microbial communities could exacerbate the AMR crisis, an issue that demands urgent investigation. 2.1 Environmental Distribution of MNPs MNPs originate from a variety of sources, including the degradation of larger plastic items, cosmetics, and industrial processes. They have been detected in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems worldwide, raising concerns about their bioavailability and interaction with living organisms (Smith et al., 2018). 2.2 MNPs as Vectors for ARGs Studies suggest that MNPs can adsorb and transport ARGs and pathogenic bacteria in the environment. This interaction is facilitated by the large surface area of MNPs, which serves as a platform for biofilm formation and gene exchange among bacteria (Liu et al., 2020). 2.3 Implications for Human Health The role of environmental MNPs in the development and spread of AMR poses a significant threat to public health. Antimicrobial resistance compromises the effectiveness of antibiotics, leading to increased morbidity and mortality from bacterial infections (WHO, 2019). 3) **Aim and Justification** This project aims to explore the hypothesis that environmental MNPs contribute to the development of AMR by serving as vectors for ARGs. Understanding this relationship is crucial for devising strategies to mitigate the spread of AMR. Specifically, the project will: - Investigate the adsorption capacity of different types of MNPs for ARGs. - Assess the potential of MNPs to facilitate horizontal gene transfer of ARGs among bacterial communities. The findings will inform environmental management practices and policies aimed at reducing the prevalence of AMR. 4) **Methods and experimental design** The study will employ a combination of laboratory experiments and field studies to achieve its objectives. 4.1 Laboratory Experiments - Adsorption Studies: Standardized tests will assess the capacity of various MNPs to adsorb ARGs from aqueous solutions. - Bacterial Cultures: Experiments will evaluate the potential of MNPs to facilitate gene transfer among bacteria harbouring ARGs. 4.2 Field Studies - Sampling: Collection of water and soil samples from different environments to assess MNP contamination and ARG prevalence. - Analysis: PCR and sequencing to identify and quantify ARGs associated with MNPs. A Gantt chart (included in Appendix) outlines the project timeline for completion within 6 months. 5) **Expected results and impact** The project is expected to demonstrate a clear link between MNPs and the development of AMR. By elucidating the mechanisms through which MNPs facilitate ARG transfer, the study will contribute to the development of interventions aimed at mitigating AMR spread. Findings will be essential for policymakers, environmental managers, and the scientific community, prompting further research into sustainable materials and waste management practices. 6) **References** - Liu, R., et al.

Please adjust according to your specific research interest, available resources, and institutional requirements. **1) Title and Names** - Title: \\"Investigating the Role of Environmental Micro and Nano-Plastics in Antimicrobial Resistance Development\\" - ID: [Your ID] - Program: [Your Program] - Module Name: [Your Module Name] - Supervisor: [Your Supervisor's Name] **2) Background Information** Recent studies have highlighted the pervasive distribution of micro and nano-plastics (MNPs) in various environmental compartments, raising concerns about their potential role in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) Development. For instance, Lu et al. (2019) demonstrated that MNPs can serve as vectors for horizontal gene transfer, a key mechanism in the spread of AMR. Similarly, Li et al. (2020) showed that MNPs could increase the mutation rate of bacterial populations, potentially accelerating AMR development. However, the mechanisms underlying these processes remain inadequately understood, necessitating further investigation. **3) Aim and Justification** The project aims to comprehensively investigate the influence of environmental MNPs on the development and spread of AMR. Given the escalating global health threat posed by AMR and the ubiquitous presence of MNPs, understanding their interconnection is crucial. This project specifically seeks to: 1) assess the capacity of MNPs to act as vectors for AMR genes, and 2) evaluate the extent to which MNPs induce genetic mutations leading to AMR in bacterial communities. **4) Methods and Experimental Design** We propose a mixed-methods approach involving both laboratory experiments and field studies. Initially, laboratory experiments will assess the gene transfer potential of MNPs among clinically relevant bacteria using plasmid conjugation experiments. Next, mutation rate assays will be conducted to determine if exposure to MNPs increases the mutation frequency in bacteria, potentially leading to AMR. A six-month Gantt chart will outline the project timeline, allocating two months for preliminary laboratory setup and pilot studies, followed by three months for main experiments and data collection, with the final month reserved for data analysis and report writing. **5) Expected Results and Impact** Anticipated results include a quantified assessment of the role of MNPs in promoting AMR through gene transfer and mutation rates. This research could significantly impact our understanding of non-traditional pathways of AMR development, informing waste management and pollution control policies to mitigate AMR risks. Further research might explore the mitigation strategies to minimize the impact of MNPs on AMR. **6) References** - Lu, L., et al. (2019). [Reference details]. - Li, J., et al. (2020).

User2: I suppose so, but it’s sad to see the end of an era. I have so many memories of watching Kids JTV with my siblings on Saturday mornings. User3: Same here, but I guess we’ll have to adapt and see what GMTV has to offer. Who knows, maybe they’ll have even better shows for kids. User1: Let’s hope so! I can’t wait to see the new lineup and introduce my kids to some new cartoons. Change can be refreshing sometimes. Write a follow up in early March 2023 where promos saying the block’s name is changing to Toonattik begin airing User1: Hey guys, have you seen the promos airing for the new cartoon kids service on GMTV? User2: Yes, I saw them! The block’s name is changing to Toonattik, it sounds like such a fun and exciting name for kids. User3: I love the sound of Toonattik! It gives me nostalgic vibes from the old Kids JTV days but with a fresh twist. I can’t wait to see what shows they have lined up. User1: Same here, I think this rebranding might bring in some new and exciting content for the kids. Change can definitely be refreshing, especially in the world of children’s programming. User2: Definitely, I’m looking forward to tuning in with my little ones and seeing what Toonattik has to offer. It’s always nice to have some quality cartoons for the kids to enjoy on the weekends. User3: Agreed, it’s important to have a good balance of entertainment for the kids. I have high hopes for Toonattik and can’t wait to see how they continue to engage and delight the young viewers. Write a follow up a few weeks later where the schedule next week is the same, and a user says GMTV aren’t actually programming the block yet, that isn’t meant to happen till September, this is just the JTV workers changing the name early to ease us into it User1: Hey, did anyone notice that the schedule for next week on GMTV’s Toonattik block is exactly the same as the Kids JTV lineup? User2: Yeah, I noticed that too! I was expecting some new shows to start airing by now, but it looks like everything is still the same. User3: I did a bit of digging online, and apparently, GMTV isn’t actually supposed to start programming the block until September. This is just the JTV workers changing the name early to ease us into the transition. User1: Ah, that makes sense. I guess they wanted to start getting us used to the idea of Toonattik before completely revamping the lineup. It’s a smart move to ease the viewers into the change. User2: I’m looking forward to seeing what new shows Toonattik will bring in September. The anticipation is killing me! User3: Same here, I can’t wait to see the new lineup and the fresh content that GMTV will be offering. It’s going to be an exciting time for kids’ programming on TV. OK, so JTV have let GMTV program their kids block on their network, This Saturday is the first week of Toonattik, Same schedule for now This talkback is for discussion on how you feel about the change, about the new bumpers, and overall the new look. Here is the first Toonattik schedule: 07:00 AM Monster Allergy 07:30 AM Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go! 08:00 AM Skunk Fu! 08:30 AM Horrid Henry 09:00 AM Kikoriki 09:30 AM The Spectacular Spider-Man 10:00 AM Tootuff 11:00 AM Johnny Test 11:30 AM Recess. Write a follow up where the bumpers are exactly the same, just with the new logo User1: So, Toonattik officially debuted this Saturday. Did anyone else notice that the bumpers are exactly the same as they were on Kids JTV, just with the new Toonattik logo? User2: Yeah, I did! I was expecting something a bit more… different? The logo change is cool, but the bumpers being the same felt a bit lazy to me. User3: I think it’s a smart move, actually. It maintains a sense of familiarity for the kids while transitioning to the new brand. The logo is quite catchy and vibrant, which does give it a fresh feel, even with the same bumpers. User1: That’s a fair point, User3. My kids didn’t seem to mind at all. They were just excited to see their favorite shows under the new Toonattik banner. I guess for them, as long as the shows are the same, the bumpers don’t really matter. User2: True, I might be looking too much into it from an adult perspective. The important thing is that the children are happy and entertained. I did like the new logo animation; it’s quite dynamic. User3: Exactly! And let’s not forget, the real test will be when GMTV starts to add their own programming in September. That’s when we’ll truly see the brand come to life with new content and hopefully, revamped bumpers to match. User1: You’re right. I’m looking forward to September then. For now, I’m just glad the transition has been smooth for the kids, and they continue to enjoy their weekend morning cartoons ritual. User2: Absolutely, keeping the children engaged and happy is the priority. Plus, it’s kind of nice to have a bit of continuity before all the changes come into effect. Eases the transition, I guess. User3: Indeed. I’ll be keeping an eye out for any updates on the new programming. I’m quite excited about the potential of Toonattik and what it could mean for children’s TV. User1: Agreed. Let’s stay optimistic and look forward to more updates as September approaches. Who knows, Toonattik might just surprise us with some fantastic shows and creative bumpers.

Do you think this means we’ll start to see more GMTV influence in the show selection and creative direction? User3: It’s interesting, for sure. The new website design is really appealing, and it’s clearly aiming at a modern, younger audience. But yeah, the GMTV ownership listing is intriguing. It could signal a bigger shift down the line.

I wonder how it will affect the content and overall strategy for Toonattik. User2: As long as the quality of the programming remains high, I’m all for it. Maybe GMTV’s ownership will bring in more resources, potentially leading to original content or exclusive shows. User3: True. A fresh influx of ideas and capital might just be what’s needed to keep Toonattik competitive and innovative. The kids’ television space is crowded, after all. User1: Exactly.

I noticed they’ve added some games and activities related to the shows, which is a smart move to keep kids coming back. User2: I saw that too! My kids have been on the website playing those games non-stop. It’s a great way to extend the viewers’ experience beyond just watching TV. Hopefully, this is a sign of more good things to come under GMTV’s ownership. User3: Definitely. I’m curious to see how they’ll leverage this new digital engagement with the TV programming. It has the potential to create a more immersive world for fans of Toonattik’s shows. User1: For sure. I think we should keep a close eye on any further developments.

Just saw the latest update for the Toonattik schedule, and there are some significant changes coming up. Tootuff is making a return! But it seems we’re saying goodbye to “Horrid Henry,” and “Rugrats” is set to replace “Johnny Test.” User2: Oh, wow! “Tootuff” coming back is a pleasant surprise. I always thought it was underrated. But “Horrid Henry” is out? That’s a bit of a shocker; it had become such a staple. User3: “Rugrats” replacing “Johnny Test” is an interesting choice.

Write a convo wondering if Johnny Test will return, and they say GMTV didn't sign up for it, thinking 3 other shows are more successful","output":"User1: Hey fellow Toonattik fans, I’ve been wondering, will Johnny Test make a return to the lineup? My kids were big fans, and it kinda grew on me too. User2: It’s interesting you bring that up. I was looking for the same info and came across some news that GMTV didn’t sign up for Johnny Test again. Seems like they believe three other shows have been more successful and appeal to their target audience better. User3: Really? That’s a bummer. Johnny Test had its charm and a pretty dedicated fanbase. Any idea which three shows they think are more successful? User1: If I had to guess, based on the new lineup and the buzz around them, it would probably be “Adventure Time,” “The Spectacular Spider-Man,” and “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.” Each of these has garnered significant attention and positive feedback since joining Toonattik. User2: Makes sense. Those shows definitely have broad appeal. “Adventure Time” and “Spider-Man” have solid fanbases spanning different age groups. And “TMNT” is, well, “TMNT” — it’s practically a legend. User3: I get the strategy, but it’s still sad to see “Johnny Test” not making the cut. The show had a unique mix of science, adventure, and humor that set it apart. I hope GMTV reconsiders or at least finds a similar show to fill that niche. User1: Agreed. It feels like there’s room for “Johnny Test” among the other successful titles. The variety it offered was a good balance between the superhero and fantasy themes of the other shows. User2: True, but I guess for now we’ll have to adapt to the new lineup. Who knows? If there’s enough demand, GMTV might bring it back in some form. Viewer feedback seems to play a significant role in their programming decisions. User3: In the meantime, I’m curious to see how GMTV continues to evolve Toonattik. They’ve made some bold choices so far, and it’s definitely sparked interest. Here’s hoping they keep the mix exciting and maybe even surprise us with a \\"Johnny Test\\" return in the future. User1: Absolutely, let’s stay optimistic and give feedback. Networks do listen, and sometimes that’s all it takes for a beloved show to make a comeback. Plus, the new shows are pretty great too, so let’s not forget to enjoy what we have."},{"instruction":"Write a convo wondering what TMNT incarnation is used","output":"User1: Quick question for the Toonattik crew—does anyone know which incarnation of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT) they’re airing? There have been so many versions over the years. User2: Good point, User1. Last I checked, they hadn’t specified which version. The 2003 series and the 2012 reboot both have strong followings. Personally, I’m hoping for the 2012 version. The animation was slick and the stories had depth. User3: I’m team 2003 all the way. It had that darker tone and was closer to the original comics. But yeah, they haven’t been clear about which version Toonattik picked up. It would be great if it’s one of the classics, but the 2018 Rise of the TMNT has its charm too with a more modern take. User4: I read somewhere that Toonattik aims for a mix of nostalgic content and new favorites, so I’m leaning towards the 2012 or even the 2003 series. They strike that balance well. The 1987 classic would be awesome, but it might not resonate as well with today's kids. User5: Don’t forget the movies and the CGI movie from 2007. Though, for a TV block, those are less likely. My bet’s on the 2012 series. It was popular, accessible, and had a good run, making it familiar to both parents and children watching. User1: All great points! It does seem like the 2012 series would be the best fit for what Toonattik is trying to accomplish. Brings together the best of both worlds: nostalgia for the older audience and modern, engaging content for the younger viewers. User2: True, and it had some awesome story arcs. The way they developed the characters and their relationships was top-notch. Plus, the action sequences were really well done. User3: Agreed, though I’ll hold onto a sliver of hope for the 2003 series. There was something special about how it captured the spirit of the comics. But I’ll be thrilled to have any TMNT on the schedule, to be honest. User4: Same here, any TMNT is better than no TMNT. It’ll be interesting to see which direction Toonattik goes. Regardless, it’s a win for TMNT fans. Can’t wait for the official announcement! User5: Exactly! It’s just great to have the turtles back in action on weekend mornings. Here’s hoping Toonattik makes the announcement soon. The anticipation is killing me! User1: Fingers crossed we get an update shortly. In the meantime, maybe it’s not a bad idea to revisit some of the older series and movies. A little TMNT marathon while we wait, anyone? User2: Count me in! There’s never a bad time for a TMNT binge.

What grabbed my attention more was the promo from last week. Did you guys notice they changed the Voice Over (VO) to Jamie Rickers from the original Kids JTV announcer? It gave the promo a fresh and exciting feel, signaling a stronger personal touch to the programming. User3: I noticed that too! Rickers' voice brought a whole new level of energy and familiarity, which I loved. It definitely sets the tone for what Toonattik is aiming for with this show being the cornerstone of their \\"funny\\" content. It’s clever marketing, making it feel more personalized and engaging for the viewers. User4: That change to Rickers got me stoked! It felt like a nod to us long-time viewers who grew up with him. It makes the show feel even more special and signifies its importance in the Toonattik block. Plus, his energy is just contagious; perfect for a comedy show. User5: Right? His voice has become almost iconic in the realm of children's programming. It bridges the gap between nostalgia for parents and the current excitement for kids.

The original strip, credited as from August 9, 2012, features Jon complaining that his jacket no longer fits after Garfield washed it. The humor in the original strip stems from the unexpected collaboration between Liz and Garfield, culminating in them fist-bumping over the mishap, showing Liz's approval or at least amusement at Garfield's antics. In the modified version, the punchline has been altered for added comedic effect. Instead of Jon simply stating that the jacket \\"doesn't fit,\\" he specifies that \\"it only fits preemies,\\" implying the jacket has shrunk to an absurdly small size. \\"Preemies\\" refers to premature babies, who are significantly smaller than full-term newborns, thus exaggerating how much the jacket has shrunk. This hyperbole enhances the humor by creating a more vivid and ridiculous image of the situation. The final panels, where Liz and Garfield fist bump, remain unchanged, maintaining the original strip's dynamic. Liz's phrase \\"You da cat\\" and Garfield's response \\"You're welcome\\" suggest a cheeky acknowledgment of Garfield's role in the incident. The fist bump here serves as a visual punchline, reinforcing the camaraderie between Liz and Garfield at Jon's expense. **Analysis:** The modification adds a layer of absurdity to the original joke. While the original humor relies more on the unexpectedness of Liz teaming up with Garfield and the casual treatment of Jon's dismay, the edited version pushes the comic situation into the realm of the ludicrous. By having the jacket shrink to a size fit only for premature babies, the comical effect is amplified, as is the visualization of Jon's annoyance and the mischievous pleasure Garfield and Liz derive from the situation. This exaggerated alteration invites the reader to imagine not just the frustration of clothing shrinking, a common annoyance, but the extreme results of Garfield's actions. This makes the comic an example of how modifying a single element (the extent to which the jacket has shrunk) can significantly change the tone and comedic impact of a joke. As with all Garfield comics, the dynamic between Jon, Garfield, and Liz is central to the humor. Garfield's nonchalant attitude and Liz's unexpected siding with Garfield against Jon highlight the playful relationships between the characters, a hallmark of the series. By maintaining the format and progression of the original comic but tweaking the dialogue for a more exaggerated effect, the modified Garfield strip offers a fresh take on a familiar joke, showcasing the versatility of comic humor and character dynamics."},{"instruction":"{THE CONSTANT - MID-SUMMER} Natsuki: \\"Wendy, you okay?

User1: Apparently, GMTV is taking over the time slot and will be providing a cartoon kids service instead. User3: That’s interesting, I wonder what kind of shows they’ll be airing. JTV had such a great lineup of shows for kids. User1: I’m not sure, but I’m excited to see what GMTV has in store. Change can be good sometimes, right? User2: I suppose so, but it’s sad to see the end of an era. I have so many memories of watching Kids JTV with my siblings on Saturday mornings. User3: Same here, but I guess we’ll have to adapt and see what GMTV has to offer. Who knows, maybe they’ll have even better shows for kids. User1: Let’s hope so! I can’t wait to see the new lineup and introduce my kids to some new cartoons. Change can be refreshing sometimes.

It gives me nostalgic vibes from the old Kids JTV days but with a fresh twist. I can’t wait to see what shows they have lined up.

User2: Yeah, I noticed that too! I was expecting some new shows to start airing by now, but it looks like everything is still the same. User3: I did a bit of digging online, and apparently, GMTV isn’t actually supposed to start programming the block until September. This is just the JTV workers changing the name early to ease us into the transition. User1: Ah, that makes sense. I guess they wanted to start getting us used to the idea of Toonattik before completely revamping the lineup. It’s a smart move to ease the viewers into the change. User2: I’m looking forward to seeing what new shows Toonattik will bring in September. The anticipation is killing me! User3: Same here, I can’t wait to see the new lineup and the fresh content that GMTV will be offering. It’s going to be an exciting time for kids’ programming on TV.

Did anyone else notice that the bumpers are exactly the same as they were on Kids JTV, just with the new Toonattik logo? User2: Yeah, I did! I was expecting something a bit more… different? The logo change is cool, but the bumpers being the same felt a bit lazy to me. User3: I think it’s a smart move, actually. It maintains a sense of familiarity for the kids while transitioning to the new brand. The logo is quite catchy and vibrant, which does give it a fresh feel, even with the same bumpers. User1: That’s a fair point, User3. My kids didn’t seem to mind at all. They were just excited to see their favorite shows under the new Toonattik banner. I guess for them, as long as the shows are the same, the bumpers don’t really matter. User2: True, I might be looking too much into it from an adult perspective. The important thing is that the children are happy and entertained. I did like the new logo animation; it’s quite dynamic. User3: Exactly! And let’s not forget, the real test will be when GMTV starts to add their own programming in September. That’s when we’ll truly see the brand come to life with new content and hopefully, revamped bumpers to match. User1: You’re right. I’m looking forward to September then. For now, I’m just glad the transition has been smooth for the kids, and they continue to enjoy their weekend morning cartoons ritual.

With these additions, it seems like Toonattik is leaning more into adventure and superhero themes. User3: Possibly, but I believe it’s a good move. Kid’s programming has always evolved, and these genres have broad appeal. Plus, they’ve kept shows like ‘Recess’ and ‘Horrid Henry’ for those seeking a bit of schoolyard humor and mischief. User1: Good point, User3. It’s all about balance, and it seems like Toonattik is finding their footing. I’m also curious to see if they’ll introduce thematic blocks within the schedule, grouping shows by genre for a more cohesive experience. User2: That would be pretty neat! Imagine a superhero hour followed by comedy or adventure. It could even introduce kids to new shows they might not have tried otherwise. User3: True. And with summer around the corner, this new lineup could really capitalize on kids being home and looking for entertainment. It’s a smart strategy by Toonattik. User1: Absolutely.

It’s got a sleek new look, and guess what? GMTV is now listed as the owners! User2: Really? That’s a bit unexpected. I thought JTV was still in charge of programming the block. Do you think this means we’ll start to see more GMTV influence in the show selection and creative direction? User3: It’s interesting, for sure. The new website design is really appealing, and it’s clearly aiming at a modern, younger audience. But yeah, the GMTV ownership listing is intriguing. It could signal a bigger shift down the line. User1: That’s what I was thinking. For now, it seems like JTV is still handling the programming, but this could be the start of a more significant transition. I wonder how it will affect the content and overall strategy for Toonattik. User2: As long as the quality of the programming remains high, I’m all for it. Maybe GMTV’s ownership will bring in more resources, potentially leading to original content or exclusive shows. User3: True. A fresh influx of ideas and capital might just be what’s needed to keep Toonattik competitive and innovative. The kids’ television space is crowded, after all. User1: Exactly. Plus, the sleek new website look is already a step in the right direction. It’s more engaging and interactive. I noticed they’ve added some games and activities related to the shows, which is a smart move to keep kids coming back. User2: I saw that too! My kids have been on the website playing those games non-stop. It’s a great way to extend the viewers’ experience beyond just watching TV. Hopefully, this is a sign of more good things to come under GMTV’s ownership. User3: Definitely. I’m curious to see how they’ll leverage this new digital engagement with the TV programming. It has the potential to create a more immersive world for fans of Toonattik’s shows. User1: For sure. I think we should keep a close eye on any further developments. This could be the beginning of a new era for Toonattik, and I’m excited to see where it goes. Let’s stay tuned and discuss any new updates as they come! User2: Agreed! Here’s hoping for the best. GMTV taking over might just be what Toonattik needed to spice things up. I’m optimistic about the future of our kids’ weekend mornings. User3: Me too.

This feels like yet another hint of the transition to GMTV’s influence. User2: Wow, Jamie Rickers and Anna Williamson? That’s a blast from the past! Their dynamic was always great to watch. This definitely adds a layer of excitement and nostalgia for the parents as much as for the kids. User3: I agree, it’s a smart move. Bringing in recognizable faces can help ease the transition for the viewers. It’s clear GMTV is strategically blending the old with the new. These pre-recorded links might be just the beginning. User1: Exactly. It’s like they’re trying to maintain a connection with the audience from JTV days while slowly bringing in their own flair. I’m curious to see how these links will be received by the new generation of viewers.

It’s a great way to create some family viewing moments. User3: You’re right, User2. It could also be a clever way to gauge audience reaction to potential future hosts or formats under the GMTV banner. I think we’re witnessing the start of more significant changes. User1: Definitely. This blending of the old guard with the new era could help Toonattik transition smoothly without losing its core audience. I’m intrigued to see what other hints or changes we’ll notice leading up to the full transition in September. User2: Me too. I hope they keep this balanced approach, respecting the history of the shows and presenters while introducing fresh content and faces. User3: Agreed. As long as they keep focusing on quality content and engaging presentation, Toonattik will continue to be a go-to spot for weekend morning cartoons.

But “Horrid Henry” is out? That’s a bit of a shocker; it had become such a staple. User3: “Rugrats” replacing “Johnny Test” is an interesting choice. It feels like Toonattik is trying to bring back some of that classic cartoon magic. “Rugrats” has always been beloved, so it might attract not just kids but also nostalgia-driven parents. User1: Exactly, User3. It seems like Toonattik is strategically mixing the old with the new to appeal to a broader audience. With GMTV gradually taking over, it’s evident they’re leaning into nostalgia while refreshing the lineup. User2: I’m excited for “Rugrats”! It’s such a timeless show. And frankly, while I’ll miss “Johnny Test,” it feels like the right time for something fresh. “Rugrats” can really bring that. User3: As for “Tootuff” returning and “Horrid Henry” exiting, it’s bittersweet. Changes like these can be tough, but they’re also necessary for keeping the content lively and engaging. Plus, it’ll be interesting to see how “Tootuff” resonates with today’s kids. User1: Agreed. I’m curious how these changes will affect the overall feel of the weekend morning block.

Toonattik was designed as a mix of live-action hosting and a variety of animated series, filling the sought-after Saturday and Sunday morning slots with vibrant entertainment geared towards children. Hosted by Jamie Rickers and Anna Williamson, Toonattik became known for its energetic and engaging presentation style. The hosts would introduce cartoons, run competitions, and engage in various comedic sketches and challenges, making the show much more than a simple block of animated programming. The chemistry between Rickers and Williamson, along with their interactions with the audience, played a key role in the show's appeal. Toonattik capitalized on the popularity of numerous animated series, serving as a platform for both well-loved and new cartoons. The range of content was diverse, catering to different interests and ensuring there was something for every viewer. This programming strategy helped to build a loyal viewership and made Toonattik a staple of CITV's weekend broadcasting. One of the key features of Toonattik was its interactivity.

Vou reformular a função para focar especificamente na alteração dos valores das propriedades, assegurando que a chave permaneça inalterada e que a correção se aplique corretamente aos valores. Para isso, é importante entender que o método \`map\` que estamos tentando aplicar em uma estrutura \`ee.Dictionary\` no contexto do Earth Engine não se comporta da mesma maneira que Array.prototype.map() em JavaScript.

Como o Google Earth Engine opera principalmente no lado do servidor, e não oferece métodos diretos e típicos do JavaScript clássico para manipulação de strings e dicionários, essa abordagem usa a API do Earth Engine para aplicar as transformações necessárias. **Nota**: tenha em mente que o ambiente de execução e as capacidades exatas do Earth Engine podem limitar a abordagem exata para manipulação de strings e outros tipos de dados.

Vamos ajustar a solução para tratar a questão dos caracteres especiais sem tentar determinar o tipo de valor com \`.getInfo()\`, já que isso contraria a abordagem recomendada de processamento no lado do servidor. Para aplicar transformações de string somente a valores que são strings, sem utilizar \`.getInfo()\`, podemos utilizar a função \`ee.Algorithms.If\`, que permite bifurcar a lógica com base em uma condição que será avaliada pelo servidor. No entanto, é importante lembrar que as operações condicionais no Google Earth Engine são melhor utilizadas com cuidado, pois cada condição deve ser capaz de ser avaliada como verdadeira ou falsa no contexto do Earth Engine. Infelizmente, não há um método direto fornecido pela API do Earth Engine para verificar o tipo de um objeto diretamente (como se fosse uma string, número, etc.) no lado do servidor sem trazer os dados para o cliente com \`.getInfo()\`. Uma aproximação comum para contornar a questão seria transformar todas as propriedades assumindo que podem ser strings e, na impossibilidade de aplicar transformações diretas às não-strings, simplesmente retornar o valor original. Esta abordagem poderia resultar em erros quando o valor não é uma string, portanto, vamos considerar que todas as propriedades são strings para a limpeza de caracteres especiais.

(stm32cubeide)","output":"To perform a single ADC read on a specific channel on an STM32F0 microcontroller using STM32CubeIDE, you'll generally follow these steps: 1. **Initialize the ADC and the specific channel** you want to read from in the STM32CubeIDE's HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) or LL (Low Layer) APIs. This involves configuring the ADC, configuring the GPIO pin as analog input, and setting up the ADC channel. 2. **Perform a single conversion** by starting the ADC, waiting for the conversion to complete, and then reading the value. 3. **Clean up**, if necessary, by disabling the ADC to save power or preparing it for the next reading. Here's a rough outline on how you can do it using HAL libraries: # Step 1: Initialize ADC and Configure Channel You can use STM32CubeIDE's graphical tool to enable and configure the ADC and the GPIO pin connected to your desired channel. Alternatively, you can do it manually in code: - **Enable ADC and GPIO Clocks**: Use \`__HAL_RCC_ADC1_CLK_ENABLE()\` and \`__HAL_RCC_GPIOx_CLK_ENABLE()\`. - **Configure GPIO Pin**: Initialize the GPIO pin connected to your ADC channel as analog. You would use \`GPIO_InitTypeDef\` and \`HAL_GPIO_Init()\`. - **Configure ADC**: Use \`ADC_HandleTypeDef\` and \`HAL_ADC_Init()\` to initialize the ADC. Then, configure the ADC channel with \`ADC_ChannelConfTypeDef\` and \`HAL_ADC_ConfigChannel()\`. # Step 2: Performing the Conversion - **Start ADC Conversion**: Use \`HAL_ADC_Start()\` to start the conversion. - **Check for Conversion Completion**: Use \`HAL_ADC_PollForConversion()\` to wait for the conversion to complete. - **Read ADC Value**: Use \`HAL_ADC_GetValue()\` to get the ADC conversion result. # Step 3: Clean-up (Optional) - **Stop ADC**: If you won't be using the ADC after this read, you might want to stop it with \`HAL_ADC_Stop()\`. - **Disable ADC Clock**: Optionally, you can disable the ADC clock to save power. # Sample Code: \`\`\`c #include \\"stm32f0xx_hal.h\\" ADC_HandleTypeDef hadc; GPIO_InitTypeDef GPIO_InitStruct = {0}; void SystemClock_Config(void); static void MX_GPIO_Init(void); static void MX_ADC_Init(void); int main(void) { HAL_Init(); SystemClock_Config(); MX_GPIO_Init(); MX_ADC_Init(); HAL_ADC_Start(&hadc); if (HAL_ADC_PollForConversion(&hadc, 100) == HAL_OK) // Wait for conversion complete, timeout 100 ms { uint32_t adcValue = HAL_ADC_GetValue(&hadc); // Read the converted value // Use adcValue as needed } HAL_ADC_Stop(&hadc); // Optionally stop the ADC while (1) { } } /* ADC init function */ void MX_ADC_Init(void) { ADC_ChannelConfTypeDef sConfig = {0}; hadc.Instance = ADC1; hadc.Init.ClockPrescaler = ADC_CLOCK_SYNC_PCLK_DIV2; hadc.Init.Resolution = ADC_RESOLUTION_12B; hadc.Init.ScanConvMode = DISABLE; hadc.Init.ContinuousConvMode = DISABLE; hadc.Init.DiscontinuousConvMode = DISABLE; hadc.Init.ExternalTrigConvEdge = ADC_EXTERNALTRIGCONVEDGE_NONE; hadc.Init.ExternalTrigConv = ADC_SOFTWARE_START; hadc.Init.DataAlign = ADC_DATAALIGN_RIGHT; hadc.Init.NbrOfConversion = 1; HAL_ADC_Init(&hadc); sConfig.Channel = ADC_CHANNEL_0; // Example: Use ADC Channel 0 sConfig.Rank = 1; sConfig.SamplingTime = ADC_SAMPLETIME_1CYCLE_5; HAL_ADC_ConfigChannel(&hadc, &sConfig); } /* GPIO init function */ static void MX_GPIO_Init(void) { /* GPIO Ports Clock Enable */ __HAL_RCC_GPIOC_CLK_ENABLE(); /*Configure GPIO pin Output Level */ HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOC, GPIO_PIN_13, GPIO_PIN_RESET); /*Configure GPIO pin : PC13 */ GPIO_InitStruct.Pin = GPIO_PIN_13; GPIO_InitStruct.Mode = GPIO_MODE_ANALOG; HAL_GPIO_Init(GPIOC, &GPIO_InitStruct); } void SystemClock_Config(void) { // System Clock configuration code... } \`\`\` Ensure you adapt GPIO port, pin, and ADC instance based on your specific needs.

GPIO Initialization: Assuming you're using GPIO pins PC13 and PB12 (just as examples, adapt to your actual needs), the initialization might look something like this: \`\`\`c #include \\"stm32f0xx_hal.h\\" // Initialization function for GPIO void MX_GPIO_Init(void) { GPIO_InitTypeDef GPIO_InitStruct = {0}; // Enable clock for the GPIO Ports __HAL_RCC_GPIOC_CLK_ENABLE(); __HAL_RCC_GPIOB_CLK_ENABLE(); // GPIO Pin Configuration for PC13 GPIO_InitStruct.Pin = GPIO_PIN_13; GPIO_InitStruct.Mode = GPIO_MODE_INPUT; GPIO_InitStruct.Pull = GPIO_NOPULL; // or GPIO_PULLUP/DOWN based on your needs HAL_GPIO_Init(GPIOC, &GPIO_InitStruct); // GPIO Pin Configuration for PB12 GPIO_InitStruct.Pin = GPIO_PIN_12; HAL_GPIO_Init(GPIOB, &GPIO_InitStruct); // Repeat the above structure for any additional GPIO pins you need } \`\`\` 2. Reading GPIO Pin State: You can now read the state of these pins anywhere in your main program loop or in a function, for example: \`\`\`c int main(void) { HAL_Init(); // Other initializations (Clock, ADC, etc.) MX_GPIO_Init(); while (1) { // Read state of GPIOC Pin 13 uint8_t state_PC13 = HAL_GPIO_ReadPin(GPIOC, GPIO_PIN_13); // Read state of GPIOB Pin 12 uint8_t state_PB12 = HAL_GPIO_ReadPin(GPIOB, GPIO_PIN_12); // Use states as needed if(state_PC13 == GPIO_PIN_SET) { // PC13 is HIGH } else { // PC13 is LOW } if(state_PB12 == GPIO_PIN_SET) { // PB12 is HIGH } else { // PB12 is LOW } // Your application logic here HAL_Delay(100); // Just an example delay } } \`\`\` This example demonstrates a basic setup for reading two GPIO pins. You will need to adapt GPIO port and pin numbers to fit your specific STM32 development board and context. Also, consider debouncing the input if these pins are connected to mechanical switches or buttons. Remember, the input pull mode (Pull-up/Pull-down/No Pull) in the \`GPIO_InitTypeDef\` should be configured considering your circuit. For instance, if you have an external pull-up resistor on a button, you can set \`.Pull = GPIO_NOPULL;\`, but if you rely on internal pull-up/down resistors, you should configure it accordingly."},{"instruction":"I ment in ADC mode.","output":"If you want to read two different GPIO pins in ADC mode on an STM32 MCU using the STM32CubeIDE, you essentially have to configure each pin you're interested in as an analog input and then perform ADC conversions for these channels. Here's a structured approach to accomplish this, highlighting sequential ADC conversions of two different channels: # Step 1: Initialize ADC and GPIOs for Analog Input Configure the ADC and GPIO pins you intend to use for ADC conversions in the CubeMX part of the STM32CubeIDE, or manually set up the ADC and GPIO pins in your code: 1. **Enable ADC and GPIO Clocks**: Enable the clocks for both the ADC and the GPIO ports connected to your target pins. 2. **Configure GPIO Pins as Analog Inputs**: Configure the pins that will be used for ADC conversions as analog inputs. 3. **Configure ADC**: Set up the ADC peripheral with the desired settings (resolution, data alignment, etc.) and configure the specific channels you'll be using. # Step 2: Perform ADC Conversions For sequential readings, you will configure the ADC to read from one channel, start the conversion, wait for it to complete, read the value, and then repeat the process for the next channel. Example Code Snippet: Here's how you might set it up in code, assuming you're using ADC_CHANNEL_0 and ADC_CHANNEL_1 for simplicity: \`\`\`c #include \\"stm32f0xx_hal.h\\" ADC_HandleTypeDef hadc; void SystemClock_Config(void); static void MX_GPIO_Init(void); static void MX_ADC_Init(void); int main(void) { HAL_Init(); SystemClock_Config(); MX_GPIO_Init(); MX_ADC_Init(); while (1) { uint32_t adcValue0, adcValue1; // Configure the ADC channel to Channel 0 ADC_ChannelConfTypeDef sConfig = {0}; sConfig.Channel = ADC_CHANNEL_0; // Assuming Channel 0 sConfig.Rank = ADC_REGULAR_RANK_1; sConfig.SamplingTime = ADC_SAMPLETIME_1CYCLE_5; HAL_ADC_ConfigChannel(&hadc, &sConfig); // Start ADC Conversion HAL_ADC_Start(&hadc); if (HAL_ADC_PollForConversion(&hadc, 10) == HAL_OK) { adcValue0 = HAL_ADC_GetValue(&hadc); } HAL_ADC_Stop(&hadc); // Now read from Channel 1 sConfig.Channel = ADC_CHANNEL_1; // Switch to Channel 1 HAL_ADC_ConfigChannel(&hadc, &sConfig); // Start ADC Conversion for Channel 1 HAL_ADC_Start(&hadc); if (HAL_ADC_PollForConversion(&hadc, 10) == HAL_OK) { adcValue1 = HAL_ADC_GetValue(&hadc); } HAL_ADC_Stop(&hadc); // Optionally, use ADC values (adcValue0, adcValue1) HAL_Delay(1000); } } // ADC Initialization here... // GPIO Initialization for Analog Inputs here... // System Clock Configuration here... \`\`\` In this example: - **\`MX_GPIO_Init()\`**: Should configure the involved GPIO pins as analog inputs. - **\`MX_ADC_Init()\`**: Should initialize the ADC with your required settings (this would typically disable Continuous Conversion Mode to perform single conversions). - **\`SystemClock_Config()\`**: Configures the system clock. This is generated automatically if you're using CubeMX. # Note: - Replace \`ADC_CHANNEL_0\` and \`ADC_CHANNEL_1\` with the actual channel numbers corresponding to your GPIO pins. - Adjust \`ADC_SAMPLETIME_1CYCLE_5\` based on your needs for sampling time. - The use of \`HAL_ADC_PollForConversion\`, \`HAL_ADC_Start\`, and \`HAL_ADC_Stop\` in between channel switches ensures that each conversion is performed distinctly. - Make sure that each peripheral's clock is enabled in your setup functions. This approach provides a straightforward way to sequentially read different ADC channels within a single loop iteration. Be aware of the potential need to give some delay or wait time between readings, depending on your application requirements and ADC settings."},{"instruction":"{THE CONSTANT - MID-SUMMER} Natsuki: \\"Wendy, the ghost constantly following you is starting to freak me out.

This bipartisan effort marks one of the largest investments in the nation’s infrastructure in decades. The bill received final approval in the Senate with a significant majority and is expected to be signed into law by the President by the end of the week. **Key Components of the Bill:** - **Transportation:** 550 billion is allocated towards the repair and construction of roads, bridges, and major infrastructure projects, with a focus on sustainability and resilience to climate change effects. - **Broadband Access:** 65 billion dedicated to expanding broadband internet access in rural areas, aiming to reduce the digital divide significantly. - **Clean Energy:** The bill earmarks 110 billion for clean energy projects, including the development of electric vehicle charging stations across the country, in a push towards reducing carbon emissions. - **Water Systems:** 45 billion is allocated for upgrading the country's water infrastructure, ensuring safer water for all Americans, and replacing lead pipes across cities. - **Public Transport:** An investment of 89 billion into public transportation systems, the largest in the country's history, to improve accessibility and efficiency. **Analysis:** The passage of this infrastructure bill represents a landmark moment in U.S. policy, reflecting a significant investment in the nation's future. By addressing both traditional infrastructure needs and embracing forward-looking initiatives like broadband expansion and clean energy, the bill aims to modernize the American economy and infrastructure, making it more resilient and competitive globally. While the bill enjoyed broad support, it also faced criticism from both extremes of the political spectrum, with some arguing it does too little to address climate change, while others decry its cost and potential impact on the national debt. Nevertheless, its passage demonstrates a rare moment of bipartisanship in an often-divided Congress. **Implications for the Future:** The bill's long-term impacts on the economy, job creation, and environmental sustainability could be profound. By investing in infrastructure, the government aims to create millions of jobs, spur economic growth, and make the U.S. more competitive on a global stage. However, the effectiveness of these initiatives and their implementation will be closely monitored in the coming years. **Conclusion:** The infrastructure bill is a significant achievement that could reshape the American landscape in numerous ways, from the daily commutes of millions to the broader economic and environmental future of the nation. Its success, however, will depend not just on the funding it provides, but on how effectively that funding is put to use in the coming decades. # Final Note: This fictional analysis serves to demonstrate how one might discuss and analyze a U.S. news story about a significant policy development.

These attacks were carried out by the Islamist extremist group al-Qaeda. In the aftermath, numerous conspiracy theories emerged surrounding the events of 9/11. Broadly speaking, these theories dispute the official accounts of the events and often suggest that U.S. government insiders played a role in facilitating or orchestrating the attacks for various purported motives, such as justifying the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq or advancing certain geopolitical or financial agendas. Some of the key conspiracy theories include: 1. **Controlled Demolition Theory:** This theory suggests that the Twin Towers and World Trade Center 7 (which also collapsed on 9/11) were brought down through a controlled demolition rather than by the impact of the airplanes and the resulting fires. Proponents point to the manner and speed of the collapse as evidence, though this has been extensively refuted by scientific investigations which show that the plane impacts and subsequent fires sufficiently weakened the buildings to cause their collapse. 2. **Pentagon Missile Theory:** Another theory posits that the damage to the Pentagon was not caused by American Airlines Flight 77 crashing into it but rather by a missile or a different type of aircraft. This is largely based on interpretations of photographic evidence and claims about the size of the impact site. However, extensive eyewitness testimony and forensic evidence support the conclusion that Flight 77 did indeed crash into the Pentagon. 3. **Foreknowledge by U.S. Government Officials:** Some theorists argue that certain individuals within the U.S. government had specific foreknowledge of the attacks and deliberately allowed them to happen. They claim this was done to mobilize public opinion in favor of military actions in the Middle East and to advance other policy goals. No credible evidence has been provided to support this theory, and it has been debunked through various commissions and investigations. It is important to note that these conspiracy theories have been debunked through numerous credible sources, including the official report by the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (also known as the 9/11 Commission), which conducted an extensive investigation into the attacks. The commission's report, released in 2004, provided a comprehensive account of the events leading up to and on September 11, 2001, based on evidence and testimony. The spread of 9/11 conspiracy theories can be attributed to various factors, including distrust in government, the traumatic and unprecedented nature of the events, and the complexity of the events themselves, which can lead to gaps in understanding that conspiracy theories seek to fill. Critical thinking, reliance on evidence-based research, and scrutiny of sources are essential when evaluating these claims."},{"instruction":"Design a roadmap for me to achieve my goal of making money on tiktok creator fund , give me a time frame and the most upto date information on the algorithm and trends as well as guides to get there , this is what the roadmap should help with : Keep doing tiktok creator fund , find the updated information , find out how much you need to pay , learn how the algorithm works.

Ludwig II. Ludwig II. wurde am 25. August 1845 in Schloss Nymphenburg geboren. Er und sein Bruder Otto bekamen eine strenge Erziehung und hatten wenig Kontakt zu den Eltern Maximilian II. von Bayern und Marie von Preußen. Zeitgenossen schreiben, dass Ludwig Kostüme, Theater und Bilder liebte. Er besaß eine starke Phantasie und war bereits in jungen Jahren ein Einzelgänger. Ludwig war erst 18 Jahre alt, als er König wurde. Er war ohne Erfahrung in der Politik und schrieb später: „Ich bin überhaupt viel zu früh König geworden. Ich habe nicht genug gelernt.\\" 1866 musste Bayern am Krieg gegen Preußen teilnehmen und verlor. Seitdem gab Preußen in der Außenpolitik die Richtung an und Ludwig musste gehor- chen. Ende des Jahres reiste Ludwig das einzige Mal durch sein Königreich. Dann ließ er seine Minister regieren und lebte einsam auf seinen Schlössern in seiner Phantasiewelt. 1867 verlobte Ludwig sich mit Sophie, der jüngeren Schwester der Kaiserin Elisabeth von Österreich. Die Hochzeit wurde vor- bereitet, aber der König löste nach einigen Monaten die Verlobung wieder. Manche Historiker denken, dass Ludwig mehr an Männern als an Frauen interes- siert war, obwohl er für viele Frauen ein Idol war. Ludwig baute sich eine „Gegenwelt\\", in der er seine Träume verwirklichen konnte. Er schlief tagsüber und lebte nachts, besuchte Thea- ter- und Opernvorstellun- gen, die nur für den König allein aufgeführt wurden, und liebte die Musik von Richard Wagner. Für seine Schlösser Neu- schwanstein, Hohenschwan- gau, Linderhof und Herren- chiemsee brauchte Ludwig riesige Mengen von Geld. Seine Regierung konnte das 1885 nicht mehr erlauben und erklärte den König für psy- chisch krank. Nun durfte er nicht mehr regieren und Ärzte und Psychiater pass- ten auf ihn auf. Er wurde in Schloss Berg am Starnberger See gefangen gehalten. Am 13. Juni 1886 starb er im Starnberger der Grund ist bis heute nicht geklärt. Sein Arzt wurde im See gefun- den, er war auch ertrunken. Ludwigs Taschenuhr war allerdings um 18.54 Uhr stehen geblieben, die Uhr des Arztes aber erst um 20.10 Uhr ... Die Eltern Maximilian und Marie liebten Ludwig sehr, waren aber auch streng. Man sagt, dass Ludwigs Hobby das Theater war. Ludwig war schon als Kind und Jugendlicher viel allein. Schon mit 18 Jahren wurde Ludwig König. Das hat ihm gut gefallen. Bayern hat gegen Preußen den Krieg verloren und musste dann in allen Entscheidungen Preußen folgen. Ludwig war oft auf Reisen durch Bayern. Die Politik hat Ludwig nicht sehr interessiert. Ludwig lebte mehr in seinen Träumen als in der Realität. Ludwig hat die Schwester von Kaiserin Elisabeth von Österreich geheiratet. Die Frauen liebten Ludwig und er liebte die Frauen. Ludwig war oft im Theater und in der Oper und zeigte sich dem bayrischen Volk. Ludwig baute vier wunderbare Schlösser. Die Schlösser waren so teuer, dass Ludwigs Minister dem König nicht mehr gehorchten. Sie erlaubten ihm nicht mehr zu regieren. Er durfte Schloss Berg am Starnberger See nicht mehr verlassen. Ludwig und sein Arzt sind im Starnberger See gestorben.","output":"Zu Ludwigs Biographie: - Die Eltern Maximilian und Marie liebten Ludwig sehr, waren aber auch streng.

Ulrike: Da Ulrike Tiere liebt, insbesondere Pferde, und gerne reitet, wäre \\"Reiterferien auf dem Bauernhof\\" die perfekte Wahl für sie. Der Bauernhof bietet neben dem Reitbetrieb auch die Nähe zu Kühen und Schweinen, was ihr Bedürfnis, auf dem Land zu sein, erfüllen dürfte. 4. Benjamin: Nachdem Benjamin seine Leidenschaft für das Klettern entdeckt hat, scheint \\"Chiemgauer Hütte\\" mit der Möglichkeit zum Bergsteigen und Wandern auf 1800 Metern Höhe ideal für ihn zu sein.

Here are some of the key benefits: 1. **Readability and Clarity**: Builder pattern allows for more readable code, especially when an object has many attributes or requires a complicated setup. Using setters or a parameterized constructor with many parameters can be confusing and error-prone. The Builder pattern makes it clear which attributes are being set, improving code readability. 2. **Immutability**: By using a Builder, you can construct immutable objects without needing to expose setters. Immutable objects are simpler to reason about and are inherently thread-safe, reducing bugs related to concurrency. Once constructed, the object's state cannot change, which is often a desirable attribute. 3. **Flexibility in Object Construction**: Builders can enforce a step-by-step process for constructing an object. This is particularly useful when an object must be built in a specific sequence or when certain fields are mandatory and others are optional. The builder can enforce these rules, something constructors or setters alone cannot easily do without adding extra complexity. 4. **Separation of Construction and Representation**: The Builder pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation. This way, the same construction process can create different representations. It's particularly beneficial when an object needs to be constructed with many optional parameters and there's a need to support multiple versions of an object. 5. **Scalability**: Adding new parameters to the class constructor requires changes wherever the constructor is invoked, which can be cumbersome and error-prone. With Builder, new fields can be added to the builder with minimal changes to the existing code, improving the scalability of the application. 6. **Parameter Validation**: Builders can encapsulate logic for validating input parameters before an object is constructed, ensuring that the resulting object is always in a consistent state. This helps in minimizing runtime errors due to invalid state. For instance, consider a class \`Person\` with multiple attributes. Using a constructor with many parameters is hard to manage and read, especially when there are several optional parameters. Conversely, using a builder pattern would allow for a fluent, step-by-step construction of a \`Person\` object in a clear and intuitive manner: \`\`\`java Person person = new Person.Builder(\\"John\\", \\"Doe\\") .age(30) .phone(\\"1234567890\\") .address(\\"123 Main St\\") .build(); \`\`\` This approach clearly indicates what attributes are being set, in contrast to a constructor that would require passing in nulls or default values for optional parameters, muddying the clarity of the object's creation. In summary, while a builder class may require more code upfront than direct instantiation, its benefits in terms of readability, maintainability, and flexibility generally outweigh the initial cost, particularly for complex objects."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},q={class:"search-container"},R={class:"card-container"},H={key:0,class:"empty-state"},_=["disabled"],B={key:0},j={key:1};function N(i,e,h,m,n,s){const g=f("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",q,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",R,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,p)=>(a(),k(g,{key:p,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",H,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
