Cone cells allow a person to see color and fine detail, and they work best in bright light. The cone dystrophies can cause a variety of symptoms such as decreased visual clarity when looking straight ahead, a reduced ability to see colors, and an increased sensitivity to light. There are two main subtypes of cone dystrophy, called stationary cone dystrophy and progressive cone dystrophy. The age when symptoms begin, the type and severity of symptoms, and the progression of symptoms are all very different between individuals, even between people with the same type of cone dystrophy. Mutations in many genes have been found to cause cone dystrophy, and the condition can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or x-linked manner."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Cone dystrophy ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Cone dystrophy?

The diagnosis of cone dystrophy is made based upon the presence of characteristic symptoms, a detailed family history, a thorough clinical evaluation and a number of supporting tests. While exams that measure visual acuity, perception of color, and field of vision are used to arrive at a proper diagnosis, an electroretinogram (ERG) is used to confirm the diagnosis. During an ERG, eye drops are used to numb the eye before a special contact lens recorder is placed on the eye. Then a series of flashes of light are used to stimulate the retina. Doctors can then measure the electrical response of the rods and cones to the light. The test is performed twice once in bright room and again in a dark room. A weak of absent signal of cone cells indicates cone dystrophy. More details about the diagnosis of cone dystrophy can be accessed through the University of Michigan Kellogg Eye Center."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Lysinuric protein intolerance ?","output":"Lysinuric protein intolerance is a metabolic disorder caused by the body's inability to digest and use the amino acids lysine, arginine, and ornithine. Because the body cannot effectively break down these amino acids, which are found in many protein-rich foods, individuals experience nausea and vomiting after ingesting protein. Other features associated with protein intolerance may also occur, including short stature, muscle weakness, impaired immune function, and osteoporosis. A lung disorder called pulmonary alveolar proteinosis may develop in some individuals, as can end-stage renal disease, coma and intellectual disability. Symptoms usually develop after infants are weaned and begin to eat solid foods. Lysinuric protein intolerance is caused by mutations in the SLC7A7 gene.

Only about 350 cases have been described in the medical literature to date. The urachus is a primitive structure which before birth connected the bellybutton and the bladder. This connection normally disappears before birth, but in some people remains. Urachal cancers are classified as such based on location at the dome or anterior wall of the bladder and discovery of remnants of the urachus. Most urachal cancers are adenocarcinomas (cancers that develop from gland cells). Others may be sarcomas (which develop from connective tissue - such as leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and malignant fibrous histiocytoma), small cell carcinomas, transitional cell cancer, and mixed neoplasias. Most individuals with urachal cancer present with hematuria (blood in urine). Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, a palpable abdominal mass, mucinuria, and bacteriuria. Patients who present with early disease confined to the urachus have a good prognosis when treated with partial cystectomy, umbilicotomy, and urachal resection.

In rare cases, people affected by schizencephaly are found to have changes (mutations) in one of four genes: EMX2, SIX3, SHH, and COL4A1. Genetic testing is available for these families. How is schizencephaly diagnosed? Schizencephaly is typically diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A CT scan is an imaging method that uses x-rays to create pictures of cross-sections of the body, while an MRI scan uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create pictures of the brain and surrounding nerve tissues. Both of these imaging methods can be used to identify brain abnormalities such as the slits or clefts found in people with schizencephaly. In some cases, schizencephaly can also be diagnosed prenatally (before birth) on ultrasound after 20 weeks gestation. If clefting is seen on ultrasound, an MRI scan of the developing baby may be recommended to confirm the diagnosis."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Schizencephaly ?","output":"How might schizencephaly be treated? The best treatment options for people with schizencephaly depend on many factors, including the severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms present. For example, people with developmental delay (i.e. delayed motor milestones) or partial paralysis may be referred for physical therapy and/or occupational therapy. Medications are often prescribed to prevent seizures. In cases that are complicated by hydrocephalus, a surgically implanted tube, called a shunt, is often used to divert fluid to another area of the body where it can be absorbed."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type 1 ?","output":"Trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type 1 (TRPS1) is an extremely rare inherited multisystem disorder.

The underlying cause of Mondini dysplasia (MD) in most individuals appears to remain unclear. Some have suggested that retinoids (vitamin A) or other factors a fetus may be exposed to early in pregnancy have contributed to some cases of isolated MD (occurring with no other abnormalities). The potential role of these factors has created increased difficulty in determining the real cause of isolated MD. Mutations in the SLC26A4 gene cause both Pendred syndrome and DFNB4 (non-syndromic hearing loss with inner ear abnormalities), which are both associated with MD. Though mutations in the SLC26A4 gene have also been found in individuals with enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA) with and without MD, studies have shown there does not appear to be a relationship between isolated MD and the SLC26A4 gene. Thus hearing impairment in individuals with isolated MD may be caused by factors other than mutations in the SLC26A4 gene. More recently, a type of mutation called a microdeletion (a tiny loss of genetic material on a chromosome that may span several genes) involving the POU3F4 gene on the X chromosome was detected in some individuals with familial MD. In cases where Mondini dysplasia is associated with a specific syndrome, the cause of the syndrome in the affected individual is assumed to be related to the occurrence of MD in those cases.

These syndromes can be inherited in a variety of ways, but Mondini dysplasia may not occur in each affected individual. It has also has been reported in families with congenital sensorineural hearing loss, both with autosomal dominant and presumed autosomal recessive inheritance. One study described familial nonsyndromic Mondini dysplasia in a mother, son and daughter with presumed autosomal dominant inheritance; another study described familial nonsyndromic Mondini dysplasia in a family in which transmission was most consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance. It has also been suggested that Mondini dysplasia may be associated with substances that may harm a developing fetus when a pregnant woman is exposed (teratogens) such as thalidomide or rubella.

The cause of DFSP is unknown but an injury to the affected skin may be a predisposing factor. Trauma at the affected site has been reported in approximately 10-20% of patients. Recent advances have shown that in approximately 90% of cases, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is associated with a rearrangement (translocation) of genetic material between chromosomes 17 and 22 which results in the fusion of two genes. The fused gene produces a protein which some believe may stimulate cells to multiply, leading to the tumor formation seen in dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. This type of gene change is generally found only in tumor cells and is not inherited."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Cap myopathy ?","output":"Cap myopathy is a disorder that primarily affects skeletal muscles, the muscles that the body uses for movement. People with cap myopathy have muscle weakness (myopathy) and poor muscle tone (hypotonia) throughout the body, but they are most severely affected in the muscles of the face, neck, and limbs. The muscle weakness, which begins at birth or during childhood, can worsen over time. The name cap myopathy comes from characteristic abnormal cap-like structures that can be seen in muscle cells when muscle tissue is viewed under a microscope. The severity of cap myopathy is related to the percentage of muscle cells that have these caps. Individuals in whom 70 to 75 percent of muscle cells have caps typically have severe breathing problems and may not survive childhood, while those in whom 10 to 30 percent of muscle cells have caps have milder symptoms and can live into adulthood. Cap myopathy can be caused by mutations in the in the ACTA1, TPM2, or TPM3 genes. This condition follows an autosomal dominant manner of inheritance, however, most cases are not inherited; they result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Chromosome 8p23.1 deletion ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Chromosome 8p23.1 deletion?

The cataracts usually result in blurred vision and severely decreased clearness or clarity of vision (visual acuity). Vision loss can potentially be profound. Males with Nance-Horan syndrome may have additional eye abnormalities, including a very small cornea (microcornea); involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and/or misalignment of the eyes (strabismus). In some cases, the entire eye may be abnormally small (microphthalmia) and/or the upper eyelid may droop (ptosis). Males with Nance-Horan syndrome may also have several dental abnormalities such as unusually shaped, extra (supernumerary) teeth, absence of some teeth (dental agenesis), impacted teeth or unusually wide spaces (diastema) between some of the teeth. The front teeth, or incisors, are usually tapered and 'screwdriver-shaped'. The teeth in the back of the mouth may be cone-shaped, rounded, or cylindrical. In many males with Nance-Horan syndrome, other physical findings may also occur. Distinctive facial features may be present, but may be subtle. The ears may be flared forward and unusually prominent. Affected males may also have a large, prominent nose with a high, narrow nasal bridge, a narrow prominent jaw, and sometimes a long, narrow face. Some males with Nance-Horan syndrome may also experience delays the skills necessary for coordinating muscular and mental activity. In addition, some reports suggest that approximately 20 to 30 percent of affected males may have varying levels of intellectual disability, which is usually mild to moderate; but in some cases can be severe. Females who carry a single copy of the mutation in the NHS gene may develop some symptoms of the disorder. However, symptoms are usually milder and more variable than those seen in males. Affected females may have abnormally small corneas (microcornea) and/or some clouding of the cornea. Vision may be normal, or there may be slightly decreased visual acuity. Without appropriate treatment, clouding of the cornea can lead to total cataracts later in life. Females often have some dental abnormalities, such as abnormally-shaped front teeth and/or unusually wide spaces between some of the teeth. Affected females usually do not develop intellectual disability. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Nance-Horan syndrome.

Nance-Horan syndrome is caused by a mutation in the NHS gene, which is located on the X chromosome.

These patients may have more problems and the problems may be more serious."},{"instruction":"NanceHoran syndrome inherited ?","output":"How is Nance-Horan syndrome inherited? Nance-Horan syndrome is inherited as an X-linked dominant trait. In X-linked dominant inheritance, both males and females can be affected by a condition. However, affected males tend to have more severe features than females. X-linked conditions result from mutations of a gene located on an X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes, but males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. In females, disease traits resulting from the abnormal copy of a gene on one X chromosome can be 'masked' by the normal copy of the gene on the other X chromosome. Because only one functioning X chromosome is required in males and females, one of the X chromosomes in each cell of a female is essentially 'turned off,' usually in a random pattern (X chromosome inactivation). Therefore, if the X chromosome with the gene mutation is activated in some cells, female carriers may have some mild features of the disorder. However, since males only have one X chromosome, they will likely fully express a condition if they inherit a gene mutation that is located on the X chromosome."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Diffuse palmoplantar keratoderma, Bothnian type ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Diffuse palmoplantar keratoderma, Bothnian type?

Eosinophils play a role in the bodys immune response by releasing toxins. Eosinophils are associated with allergic-type reactions, but their specific function is largely unknown.When eosinophils build up in the gastrointestinal tract, this begins to affect the body by causing polyps, tissue break down, inflammation, and ulcers. Eosinophilic enteropathy can occur in children or adults and is characterized by intolerance to some foods. Eosinophilic enteropathy can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, and is often named by the part affected: colon (colitis), esophagus (esophagitis), stomach (gastritis), or both the stomach and small intestine (gastroenteritis)."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Eosinophilic enteropathy ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of eosinophilic enteropathy? The symptoms of eosinophilic gastroenteritis vary depending on where the eosinophils build up in the gastrointestinal system and which layers of the intestinal wall are involved. Symptoms often include pain, skin rash, acid reflux, anemia, diarrhea, stomach cramps, bleeding, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, blood loss in stools, and choking. Symptoms can occur at any age, although they usually develop between ages 20 and 50 years. The symptoms of eosinophilic enteropathy overlap with other gastrointestinal disorders, such as ulcerative colitis, which makes diagnosis difficult. It is common for individuals with this disorder to have symptoms for many years before an accurate diagnosis is made."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose Eosinophilic enteropathy ?","output":"How is eosinophilic enteropathy diagnosed? Endoscopy and biopsy is the only way to confirm the diagnosis of eosinophilic enteropathy. During an endoscopy, a gastroenterologist looks at the gastrointestinal tract through an endoscope and takes multiple small samples (biopsies), which a pathologist reviews. A high number of eosinophils suggests the diagnosis of eosinophilic enteropathy. The pathologist will also look at the location of the eosinophils, changes in the tissue layers, and degranulation (spilling of the contents of the eosinophils). Eosinophils may be normally found in small numbers in all areas of the gastrointestinal tract except the esophagus. However, the number of eosinophils seen in individuals with eosinophilic enteropathy is much higher. Once the diagnosis of eosinophilic enteropathy is confirmed, food allergy testing is typically recommended to guide treatment. Tests for food allergies include skin prick testing, patch testing, and a Radioallergosorbent test (RAST)."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Eosinophilic enteropathy ?","output":"How might eosinophilic enteropathy be treated? There is no \\"cure\\" for eosinophilic enteropathy, but treatment can help alleviate symptoms and prevent further damage to the gastrointestinal tract. Treatment of eosinophilic enteropathy varies based on the location of the eosinophils, severity of symptoms, and other medical problems the child or adult may have. In most cases, dietary restrictions and medications can significantly improve the problematic symptoms of this condition. Food allergy testing is used as a guide for restriction or elimination diets. An elimination diet means strictly avoiding all foods to which the patient has tested positive on allergy testing. Skin and patch testing are used to guide elimination diets. Sometimes a stricter diet, called an elemental diet, is needed. Skin and patch testing are used to guide elimination diets, but it only takes one false negative food for the diet to \\"fail\\". Elemental diets are diets that do not include whole or broken-down forms of protein. Instead, special elemental formulas are used, which are made of amino acids (the building blocks of proteins), fats, sugars, vitamins and minerals. Amino acids do not cause allergic reactions but whole or partial proteins can. Children and adults who rely in part, or completely, on an elemental amino acid based formula may have a difficult time drinking enough of the formula. To maintain proper nutrition, some require tube feedings directly into the stomach (enteral feeds). In the most severe cases, nutrition is administered directly into the blood stream (parenteral feeds). The American Partnership for Eosinophilic Disorders provides more information about treatment for eosinophilic enteropathy. This organization also provides more details on restricted or elimination diets and elemental diets."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Benign multicystic peritoneal mesothelioma ?","output":"Benign multicystic peritoneal mesothelioma (BMPM) is a very rare benign cystic tumor arising from the peritoneal mesothelium (lining of the abdominal wall).

While children usually respond better to revascularization surgery than adults, the majority of individuals have no further strokes or related problems after surgery. No medication can stop the narrowing of the brain's blood vessels, or the development of the thin, fragile vessels that characterize the disease. However, medications are used to treat many of the symptoms of the disease, and are often an important part of the management. Medications may include aspirin (to prevent or reduce the development of small blood clots); calcium channel blockers (which may improve symptoms of headaches and reduce symptoms related to transient ischemic attacks); and anti-seizure medications (when needed for a seizure disorder). In a few cases, anticoagulants may be needed for people with unstable or frequent symptoms. However, they are not used long-term due to the risk of cerebral bleeding.

No specific therapy exists for people with Gorham's disease. Certain treatments may be effective in some, but not others. Several different methods are often used before finding one that is effective. In some cases, treatment may not be necessary. Most people require intense treatment, especially if the disease has spread to other areas of the body or if there is extensive involvement in the spine and skull. Treatment options include radiation therapy, steroids, and/or surgery that may involve bone grafting. Other treatments might include biphosphonates (such as pamidronate or zoledronic acid) and alpha-2b interferon. These treatments have led to improvement of symptoms in some cases. More research is necessary to determine the long-term safety and effectiveness of these therapies in people with Gorham's disease. All treatments (pharmacological and surgical) are all still considered to be experimental since there have been no studies done to examine the effectiveness of anything used to date. In general, no single treatment has been proven effective in stopping the progression of the disease."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ?","output":"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a neurological disorder that damages the myelin that covers and protects nerves in the white matter of the brain.

It is characterized by hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and acanthosis nigricans. Insulin resistance is a condition in which the body produces insulin but does not use it properly. This causes the pancreas to produce more insulin. High levels of insulin stimulate the ovaries to make too much androgen, leading too excessive hair growth, acne, and irregular periods. Insulin resistance can also lead to diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, and excessive growth and darkening of the skin (aconthosis nigricans).

Sebaceous adenoma is the most characteristic finding in people with Muir-Torre syndrome (MTS). Other types of skin tumors in affected people include sebaceous epitheliomas, sebaceous carcinomas (which commonly occur on the eyelids) and keratoacanthomas. Sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelid can invade the orbit of the eye and frequently metastasize, leading to death. Tumors at other sites can also metastasize, but are less likely to cause death. Common sites of keratocathomas include the face and the upper side of the hands, but they can occur anywhere on the body. The most common internal cancer in people with MTS is colorectal cancer, occurring in almost half of affected people. The second most common site is the genitourinary tract.

Muir-Torre syndrome is a subtype of Lynch syndrome and may be caused by changes (mutations) in either the MLH1, MSH2, or MSH6 gene. These genes give the body instructions to make proteins needed for repairing DNA. The proteins help fix mistakes that are made when DNA is copied before cells divide. When one of these genes is mutated and causes the related protein to be absent or nonfunctional, the number of DNA mistakes that do not get repaired increases substantially. The affected cells do not function normally, increasing the risk of tumor formation. The MSH2 gene is responsible for MTS in the majority of cases. Mutations in MLH1 and MSH2 have the most severe effect. Not everyone diagnosed with MTS will have a detectable mutation in one of these genes. Other, unidentified genes may also play a role in the development of the condition."},{"instruction":"MuirTorre syndrome inherited ?","output":"How is Muir-Torre syndrome inherited? Muir-Torre-syndrome (MTS) is a variant of Lynch syndrome and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that having only one changed (mutated) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough for a person to develop the condition. When a person with an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit the mutated copy of the responsible gene. It is important to note that people who inherit a mutated gene that causes MTS inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit a mutation in an associated gene will develop cancer. This phenomenon is called reduced penetrance. The majority of people diagnosed with a form of Lynch syndrome have inherited the mutated gene from a parent. However, because not all people with a mutation develop cancer, and the variable age at which cancer may develop, not all people with a mutation have a parent who had cancer. Thus, the family history may appear negative. A positive family history of MTS is identified in roughly 50% of affected people. The percentage of people with Lynch syndrome who have a new mutation in the gene that occurred for the first time (and was not inherited from a parent) is unknown but is estimated to be extremely low."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose MuirTorre syndrome ?","output":"How is Muir-Torre syndrome diagnosed?

The condition affects the retina, which is a specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. This affects the sharpness of vision. Central vision is more commonly affected. Vision often deteriorates early in life, but then usually becomes stable until late adulthood. A second decline in vision typically occurs in a man's fifties or sixties. Sometimes severe complications occur, including separation of the retinal layers (retinal detachment) or leakage of blood vessels in the retina (vitreous hemorrhage). These can lead to blindness.

Mutations in the RS1 gene cause most cases of juvenile retinoschisis. The RS1 gene provides instructions for producing a protein called retinoschisin, which is found in the retina. Studies suggest that retinoschisin plays a role in the development and maintenance of the retina, perhaps playing a role in cell adhesion (the attachment of cells together). RS1 gene mutations lead to a reduced amount or complete absence of retinoschisin, which can cause tiny splits (schisis) or tears to form in the retina. This damage often forms a \\"spoke-wheel\\" pattern in the macula, which can be seen during an eye examination. In about half of individuals, these abnormalities are seen in the area of the macula, affecting visual acuity. In the other half, the sides of the retina are affected, resulting in impaired peripheral vision. Some individuals with juvenile retinoschisis do not have a mutation in the RS1 gene. In these individuals, the cause of the disorder is unknown."},{"instruction":"Juvenile retinoschisis inherited ?","output":"How is juvenile retinoschisis inherited? Juvenile retinoschisis is inherited in an x-linked recessive pattern. The gene associated with this condition is located on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation must be present in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. A striking characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons. In X-linked recessive inheritance, a female with one mutated copy of the gene (mutation) in each cell is called a carrier. She can pass on the mutation, but usually does not experience signs and symptoms of the condition. Carrier women have a 50% chance of passing the mutation to their children, males who inherit the mutation will be affected; females who inherit the mutation will be carriers and will nearly always have normal vision. Carrier testing for at-risk female relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the disease-causing mutation in the family is known."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Juvenile retinoschisis ?","output":"What treatment is available for juvenile retinoschisis? There is no specific treatment for juvenile retinoschisis. Low vision services are designed to benefit those whose ability to function is compromised by impaired vision.

Decisions regarding the length of steroid treatment and the rate of tapering off steroids are based on the individual's response to treatment. Treatment may last as long as two years in some patients. People with HE who experience repeated HE relapses, do not respond to steroids, and/or cannot tolerate steroid treatment have been treated with other immunosuppressive medications such as azathioprine and cyclophosphamide. Intravenous immunoglobulin, and plasmapheresis have also been used."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Infantile Parkinsonismdystonia ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Infantile Parkinsonism-dystonia?

The diabetes in MIDD is characterized by high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) resulting from a shortage of the hormone insulin, which regulates the amount of sugar in the blood. MIDD is caused by mutations in the MT-TL1, MT-TK, or MT-TE gene. These genes are found in mitochondrial DNA, which is part of cellular structures called mitochondria. Although most DNA is packaged in chromosomes within the cell nucleus, mitochondria also have a small amount of their own DNA (known as mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA). Because the genes involved with MIDD are found in mitochondrial DNA, this condition is inherited in a mitochondrial pattern, which is also known as maternal inheritance. Because egg cells, but not sperm cells, contribute mitochondria to the developing embryo, only females pass mitochondrial conditions to their children. Mitochondrial disorders can appear in every generation of a family and can affect both males and females, but fathers do not pass mitochondrial traits to their children."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Maternally inherited diabetes and deafness ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Maternally inherited diabetes and deafness?

It most often develops in young and middle-aged men. It tends to grow rapidly and spread outside the testicle. Embryonal carcinomas are classified as nonseminoma germ cell tumors. Most testicular cancers grow from germ cells, the cells that make sperm. Germ cell tumors are broadly divided into seminomas and nonseminomas because each type has a different prognosis and treatment regimen. Nonseminomas, which are more common, tend to grow more quickly than seminomas. Nonseminoma tumors are often made up of more than one type of cell, and are identified according to the different cell types."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Mnire's disease ?","output":"Mnire's disease is an abnormality of the inner ear.

Some people develop symptoms in both ears many years after their initial diagnosis. The exact cause of Mnire's disease is unknown, but the symptoms are thought to be associated with a change in fluid volume within a portion of the inner ear known as the labyrinth. Treatment may include medications or surgery depending on the severity of the condition."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Mnire's disease ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Mnire's disease? The symptoms of Mnire's disease typically occur suddenly and can arise daily, or as infrequently as once a year. Vertigo, often the most debilitating symptom of Mnire's disease, typically involves a whirling dizziness that forces the affected person to lie down. Vertigo attacks can lead to severe nausea, vomiting, and sweating, and often come with little or no warning. Some people with Mnire's disease have attacks that start with tinnitus (ear noises), a loss of hearing, or a full feeling or pressure in the affected ear. It is important to remember that all of these symptoms are unpredictable. Typically, the attack is characterized by a combination of vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss lasting several hours. People experience these discomforts at varying frequencies, durations, and intensities. Some may feel slight vertigo a few times a year. Others may be occasionally disturbed by intense, uncontrollable tinnitus while sleeping. Affected people may also notice hearing loss or feel unsteady for prolonged periods. Other occasional symptoms of Mnire's disease may include headaches, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea. A person's hearing tends to recover between attacks but over time may become worse. Meniere's disease usually starts in one ear but it may extend to involve both ears over time. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Mnire's disease.

The underlying cause of Mnire's disease is unknown, although it probably results from a combination of environmental and genetic factors. Possible factors that have been studied include viral infections; trauma to the middle ear; middle ear infection (otitis media); head injury; a hereditary predisposition; syphilis; allergies; abnormal immune system responses; migraines; and noise pollution. The symptoms of Mnire's disease are thought to relate to changes in fluid volume in the inner ear, which contains structures necessary for normal hearing and balance. Changes in fluid volume may disrupt signals sent from the inner ear to the brain, or may lead to tears or ruptures of the structures that affect hearing and balance. More detailed information about the causes of symptoms associated with Mnire's disease is available on NIDCD's Web site."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose Mnire's disease ?","output":"How is Mnire's disease diagnosed? The hallmark of Mnire's disease is the fluctuation, waxing and waning of symptoms. Proper diagnosis of Mnire's disease entails several procedures, including a medical history interview; a physical examination; hearing and balance tests; and medical imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Accurate measurement and characterization of hearing loss are of critical importance in the diagnosis of Mnire's disease. Through the use of several types of hearing tests, physicians can characterize hearing loss as being sensory (arising from the inner ear) or neural (arising from the hearing nerve). Recording the auditory brain stem response, which measures electrical activity in the hearing nerve and brain stem, is useful in differentiating between these two types of hearing loss. Electrocochleography, recording the electrical activity of the inner ear in response to sound, helps confirm the diagnosis. To test the vestibular or balance system, physicians irrigate the ears with warm and cool water or air. This procedure, known as caloric testing, results in nystagmus, rapid eye movements that can help a physician analyze a balance disorder. Since tumor growth can produce symptoms similar to Mnire's disease, an MRI is a useful test to determine whether a tumor is causing the patient's vertigo and hearing loss."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Mnire's disease ?","output":"How might Mnire's disease be treated? At the present time there is no cure for Mnire's disease, but there are several safe and effective medical and surgical therapies that are available to help individuals cope with the symptoms. The symptoms of the disease are often controlled successfully by reducing the bodys retention of fluids through dietary changes (such as a low-salt or salt-free diet and no caffeine or alcohol). Medications such as antihistamines, anticholinergics, and diuretics may lower endolymphatic pressure by reducing the amount of endolymphatic fluid. Eliminating tobacco use and reducing stress levels may also help lessen the severity of symptoms. Symptoms such as dizziness, vertigo, and associated nausea and vomiting may respond to sedative/hypnotics, benzodiazepines like diazepam and anti-emetics. Different surgical procedures are an option for individuals with persistent, debilitating vertigo. Labyrinthectomy (removal of the inner ear sense organ) can effectively control vertigo, but sacrifices hearing and is reserved for patients with nonfunctional hearing in the affected ear. Vestibular neurectomy, selectively severing a nerve from the affected inner ear organ, usually controls the vertigo while preserving hearing but carries surgical risks. Recently, the administration of the ototoxic antibiotic gentamycin directly into the middle ear space has gained popularity worldwide for the control of vertigo associated with Mnire's disease. An article published in the journal Lancet in August 2008, written by Sajjadi and Paparella, reviews treatment options and strategies for individuals with Mnire's disease.

Behavioral treatment seems to be the most powerful treatment for trichotillomania. Parental involvement is important and should include enough support so that affected children grow well intellectually, physically, and socially. Shaving or clipping hair close to the scalp may be helpful to stop the behavior. Professional cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is recommended if initial approaches are unsuccessful. CBT typically involves self monitoring (keeping records of the behavior); habit-reversal training; and stimulus control (organizing the environment). CBT is typically effective in highly motivated and compliant patients. The success of therapy may depend on firm understanding of the illness and the cooperation of the family members to help the affected individual comply with treatment. Several courses of CBT may be needed. No medication has been approved for the treatment of trichotillomania, and medications used have not been consistently effective. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been utilized but responses to treatment have not been consistent. Fortunately, several recent studies regarding drug therapy for trichotillomania show promise.

This form of dystonia is called 'dopa-responsive' dystonia because the symptoms typically improve during treatment with levodopa and carbidopa."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Doparesponsive dystonia ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Dopa-responsive dystonia? The most common form of dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) is autosomal dominant DRD (caused by a mutation in the GCH1 gene). This form of DRD is usually characterized by childhood-onset dystonia that may be associated with parkinsonism at an older age. The average age of onset is 6 years, and females are 2-4 times more likely than males to be affected. Symptoms usually begin with lower limb dystonia, resulting in gait problems that can cause stumbling and falling. Symptoms are often worse later in the day, a phenomenon known as diurnal fluctuation. In rare cases, the first symptom may be arm dystonia, tremor of the hands, slowness of movements, or cervical dystonia. This form of DRD usually progresses to affect the whole body, and some people also develop parkinsonism. Depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances and obsessive-compulsive disorder have been reported in some people. Intellectual function is normal. Those with onset at older ages tend to be more mildly affected. Another form of DRD is due to a rare condition called sepiapterin reductase deficiency, which is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This form of DRD is also characterized by dystonia with diurnal fluctuations, but also affects motor and cognitive development. Onset usually occurs before the first year of life. Sleep disturbances and psychological symptoms (anxiety, irritability) are common later in childhood. A third form of DRD is autosomal recessive DRD, also called tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency. This form is characterized by a spectrum of symptoms, ranging from those seen in the autosomal dominant form to progressive infantile encephalopathy. Onset is usually in infancy. Intellectual disability, developmental motor delay, and various other features may be present. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Dopa-responsive dystonia. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms.

The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom.

Depending on the genetic cause of dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD), it may be inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner. When DRD is caused by mutations in the GCH1 gene, it is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that having a mutation in only one of the 2 copies of the gene is enough to cause signs and symptoms of the disorder. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from an affected parent; other cases result from having a new (de novo) mutation in the gene. When a person with an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit the mutated gene. Some people who inherit a mutated GCH1 gene never develop features of DRD; this phenomenon is known as reduced penetrance. When DRD is caused by mutations in the TH gene, it is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that a person must have mutations in both of their copies of the gene to be affected. The parents of a person with an autosomal recessive condition usually each carry one copy of the mutated gene and are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not have signs or symptoms. When parents who are both carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected, a 50% chance to be an unaffected carrier like each parent, and a 25% chance to be unaffected and not be a carrier. When DRD is caused by mutations in the SPR gene, it can be inherited in an autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant manner."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose Doparesponsive dystonia ?","output":"How is dopa-responsive dystonia diagnosed? Dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) is diagnosed based on the signs and symptoms present, results of laboratory tests (sometimes including genetic testing), and response to therapy with levodopa. If DRD is suspected, a therapeutic trial with low doses of levodopa remains the most practical approach to the diagnosis. It is generally agreed that people with childhood-onset dystonia of unknown cause should be treated initially with levodopa. The characteristic symptoms and response to treatment are sufficient to establish the diagnosis for people with the most common form, autosomal dominant DRD. There is only one gene in which mutations are known to cause this form of DRD, but not all people with the disorder are found to have a mutation in the responsible gene. While finding a mutation may provide information about prognosis, it does not alter the treatment. Other types of laboratory tests, such as measuring specific substances or enzymes in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), may be useful to support the diagnosis. For tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency, an autosomal recessive genetic cause of DRD, molecular genetic testing has confirmed the presence of mutations in all affected people to date. Specific laboratory tests performed on CSF help support the diagnosis but are not diagnostic on their own. For sepiapterin reductase deficiency, a very rare autosomal recessive form of DRD, there are distinctive findings in CSF and reduced or absent activity of sepiapterin reductase in fibroblasts. Molecular genetic testing can identify mutations in the responsible gene and confirm the diagnosis of this form of DRD. The major conditions that may have a similar presentation to DRD and are part of the differential diagnosis include early-onset parkinsonism, early-onset primary dystonia, and cerebral palsy or spastic paraplegia. People with specific questions about being evaluated for any form of dystonia should speak with a neurologist or other health care provider."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ?","output":"Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an inherited heart condition characterized by thickening of the heart muscle. The thickening most often occurs in the muscle wall that separates the left and right ventricles from each other (interventricular septum). This may restrict the flow of oxygen-rich blood from the heart, or it may lead to less efficient pumping of blood. Signs and symptoms can vary. While some people have no symptoms, others may have chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, lightheadedness, dizziness, and/or fainting. Even in the absence of symptoms, familial HCM can have serious consequences such as life-threatening arrhythmias, heart failure, and an increased risk of sudden death. Familial HCM may be caused by mutations in any of several genes and is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Treatment may depend on severity of symptoms and may include medications, surgical procedures, and/or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?

Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is caused by mutations in any of several genes. The genes most commonly responsible are the MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNT2, and TNNI3 genes. Other genes that have not yet been identified may also be responsible for familial HCM. The genes known to be responsible for familial HCM give the body instructions to make proteins that play important roles in contraction of the heart muscle. The proteins form structures in muscle cells called sarcomeres, which are needed for muscle contractions. Sarcomeres are made of protein fibers that attach to each other and release, allowing muscles to contract. The contractions of heart muscle are needed to pump blood to the rest of the body. While it is unclear exactly how mutations in these genes cause familial HCM, they are thought to lead to abnormal structure or function of sarcomeres, or reduce the amount of proteins made. When the function of sarcomeres is impaired, normal heart muscle contractions are disrupted."},{"instruction":"Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy inherited ?","output":"How is familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy inherited?

Yes. Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is caused by mutations in any of several known genes, and possibly other genes that have not yet been identified. Genetic testing for HCM is most informative as a \\"family test\\" rather than a test of one person. Results are most accurately interpreted after merging both genetic and medical test results from multiple family members. Ideally, the family member first having genetic testing should have a definitive diagnosis of HCM and be the most severely affected person in the family. Genetic testing of at-risk, asymptomatic relatives is possible when the responsible mutation has been identified in an affected family member. Testing should be performed in the context of formal genetic counseling. An algorithm showing a general approach to finding the specific genetic cause in people with HCM can be viewed here. The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests for familial HCM. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. As is often the case with genetic testing in general, there are benefits and limitations of genetic testing for familial HCM. Testing may confirm the diagnosis in a person with symptoms, and may help to identify family members at risk. However, results are sometimes unclear; testing cannot detect all mutations; and results cannot be used to predict whether a person will develop symptoms, age of onset, or long-term outlook (prognosis)."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Narcolepsy ?","output":"Narcolepsy is a chronic brain disorder that involves poor control of sleep-wake cycles.

Narcolepsy is often diagnosed in adolescence and young adulthood, when falling asleep suddenly in school brings the problem to attention. However, for many people with narcolepsy, the disorder is not diagnosed for up to 10-15 years after symptoms first begin. The disorder may be misdiagnosed as various other conditions or psychological problems. While it is most easily recognized if all the major symptoms are reported, making the diagnosis based solely on symptoms is difficult. People often seek medical help for single symptoms that could be associated with other disorders, particularly epilepsy. In come cases, symptoms are not dramatically apparent for years. Sleep studies are an essential part of the evaluation of people with possible narcolepsy. The combination of an overnight polysomnogram (PSG) followed by a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) can provide strongly suggestive evidence of narcolepsy, while excluding other sleep disorders. Measurement of hypocretin levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may further help to establish the diagnosis. People with narcolepsy often have extremely low levels of hypocretin in their CSF. In some cases, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing may be helpful."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Narcolepsy ?","output":"How might narcolepsy be treated? There is currently no cure for narcolepsy, but some of the symptoms can be managed with medications and lifestyle changes. Most affected people improve if they maintain a regular sleep schedule, usually 7.5 to 8 hours of sleep per night. Scheduled naps during the day also may help. Other measures that may help include participating in an exercise program; receiving emotional support and career or vocational counseling; and avoiding high-risk behaviors such as alcohol and drug use, which may make symptoms worse. Common-sense measures should be taken to enhance sleep quality (such as avoiding heavy meals before bed time). Treatment with medications involves the use of central nervous system (CNS) stimulants. These medications help reduce daytime sleepiness and improve this symptom in 65-85% of affected people. Two types of antidepressant drugs (tricyclics, and selective serotonin and noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors) are effective in controlling cataplexy in many people. Sodium oxybate (a strong sedative taken during the night) may also be used to treat narcolepsy.

Partial or complete agenesis of the dorsal pancreas results from the failure of the dorsal pancreatic bud to form the body and tail of the pancreas in the developing fetus. It may occur from the absence, or regression of, the dorsal bud during fetal development. Heredity may play a role in the development of this condition, but further research is needed to clarify this. There have been reports in the literature of the condition being associated (rarely) with other congenital diseases, specifically a very rare disorder called polysplenia/heterotaxy syndrome. In this case, it may occur due to errors in development of the asymmetric organs and may be associated with benign to severe congenital cardiac (heart) malformations."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Agenesis of the dorsal pancreas ?","output":"How might agenesis of the dorsal pancreas be treated? Because agenesis of the dorsal pancreas is considered rare and few cases have been reported in the literature, there is limited information about how the condition as a whole might be treated or managed. However, there is current information about how some of the signs and symptoms associated with agenesis of the dorsal pancreas (such as pancreatitis) may be managed. For pancreatitis, individuals may be able to make themselves more comfortable during an attack, but they will most likely continue to have attacks until treatment is received for the underlying cause of the symptoms (when possible). If symptoms are mild, people might try the following preventive measures: stopping all alcohol consumption; adopting a liquid diet consisting of foods such as broth, gelatin, and soups (these simple foods may allow the inflammation process to get better); over-the-counter pain medications; and avoiding pain medications that can affect the liver (such as acetaminophen). Medical treatment is usually focused on relieving symptoms and preventing further aggravation to the pancreas. Certain complications of either acute pancreatitis or chronic pancreatitis may require surgery or a blood transfusion. In acute pancreatitis, the choice of treatment is based on the severity of the attack. Most people who are having an attack of acute pancreatitis are admitted to the hospital for oxygen (if having trouble breathing) and an intravenous (IV) line for medications and fluids. If needed, medications for pain and nausea may be prescribed. It may be recommended that no food or liquid is taken by mouth for a few days (this is called bowel rest). Some people may need a nasogastric (NG) tube to remove stomach juices which rests the intestine further, helping the pancreas recover. If the attack lasts longer than a few days, nutritional supplements may be administered through an IV line. In chronic pancreatitis, treatment focuses on relieving pain and avoiding further aggravation to the pancreas. Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) management may depend on the exact cause if the condition in the affected individual. Management may include checking blood sugar levels with a blood glucose meter; checking urine for ketones; and adopting strategies to lower blood sugar level. Strategies might include exercise (only if urine ketones are not present); diet as discussed with a diabetes health educator or registered dietitian; and/or medication (especially if diet and exercise are not keeping blood sugar levels in the normal range) which may include insulin and/or other medications. Individuals seeking treatment options for themselves or others should speak with their health care provider about an individualized treatment plan; the information here is provided for general educational purposes only."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Fountain syndrome ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Fountain syndrome?

Symptoms of Brody disease typically begin in childhood. Children with this condition may have a hard time keeping up with their peers in physical activities. They have a difficult time relaxing muscles, first in their arms and legs, but then in their face and trunk. They may also have difficulty relaxing their eyelids and grip. These muscle symptoms worsen with exercise and exposure to cold weather. In people with Brody disease, the term pseudomyotonia is used to describe these muscle symptoms. The term myotonia refers to muscle stiffness or an inability to relax the muscles and can be evidenced by abnormal electromyography (EMG) results. In Brody disease the EMG results are normal, even though the person show signs of the muscle stiffness. Because of the normal EMG results, the word pseudo-myotonia is used. In addition to the pseudomyotonia, people with Brody disease sometimes develop myoglobinuria. Myoglobinuria is the abnormal breakdown of the muscle protein, myoglobin. Click here to learn more about testing for myoglobinuria. People with Brody disease do not tend to have percussion myotonia.

Brody disease can be caused by mutations in the gene ATP2A1. In general, genes contain the information needed to make functional molecules called proteins. These proteins are required for our bodies cells (and ultimately tissues, like our muscles) to work correctly. Gene mutations can result in faulty proteins. The ATP2A1 gene tells the body how to make a protein called SERCA Ca(2+)-ATPase. This protein is involved in moving calcium around in the cell, which is important for normal muscle contraction. Mutations in this gene results in problems with calcium transportation in the cell, and ultimately problems with muscle contraction.

CMT1 is generally slowly progressive over many years. However, affected individuals often experience long periods without any obvious deterioration or progression. Occasionally, individuals show accelerated deterioration of function over a few years. Nerve conduction velocities (NCVs) tend to slow progressively over the first two to six years of life, but they appear to remain relatively stable throughout adulthood. Worsening of signs and symptoms tends to be slow in the second to fourth decades of life. It remains to be confirmed whether, and to what extent, there is clinical and electrophysiological disease progression in affected adults; two studies of adult with CMT1A have shown conflicting results. Authors of one study reported disease progression over time (23 years on average), while authors of another study found that both patients and controls (individuals without the condition) had a similar decline of strength and of electrophysiological findings. The findings in the latter study suggested that the decline in adulthood in affected individuals may reflect a process of normal aging rather than on-going active disease. Any major changes in the pace of progression may warrant consideration of additional acquired, or possibly independently inherited forms, of neuromuscular diseases.

Approximately 90% of individuals with EEC syndrome have a causative mutation identified in the TP63 gene. The TP63 gene codes for the p63 protein, which plays a critical role in early development of the ectoderm-the layers of tissue that develop into the skin, hair, teeth, and nails. The p63 protein is additionally thought to play a role in the development of the limbs, facial features, urinary system, and other organs. Individuals that have EEC syndrome due to a mutation in the TP63 gene are classified as having EEC syndrome type 3 (EEC3). In approximately 10% of individuals, EEC syndrome is caused by a mutation on a region of the q (long) arm of chromosome 7. Individuals that have EEC syndrome due to a mutation on the q arm of chromosome 7 are classified as having EEC syndrome type 1 (EEC1). Rarely, EEC syndrome can be found in individuals that do not have mutations in either the TP63 gene or the q arm of chromosome 7."},{"instruction":"EEC syndrome inherited ?","output":"How is EEC syndrome inherited? EEC syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.This means that having a change (mutation) in only one copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause features of the condition. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutated gene from an affected parent. In other cases, the mutation occurs for the first time in a person with no family history of the condition. This is called a de novo mutation. When a person with a mutation that causes an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit that mutation. EEC can appear to be caused by a de novo mutation in some instances when an unaffected parent of an affected child has germline mosaicism. Germline mosaicism affects the genetic make-up of the egg and sperm cell only. It is estimated that unaffected parents of a child with EEC syndrome have a 4% risk of having another affected child. EEC syndrome additionally shows reduced penetrance and variable expressivity. Reduced penetrance means that not all individuals with a mutation in the disease-causing gene will have signs and symptoms of the condition; however, in this condition, it has been reported that up to 93-98% of individuals with a mutation will have the condition. Variable expressivity means that there is a range of signs and symptoms that can occur in different people with the condition (i.e. the expression of the condition varies)."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose EEC syndrome ?","output":"Is genetic testing available for EEC syndrome? It is estimated that greater than 90% of cases of EEC syndrome are caused by mutations in the TP63 gene. The remainder are suspected to be caused by different mutations in a region on chromosome 7.

The overgrowth can cause differences in appearance and with time, an increased risk for blood clots and tumors. It is caused by a change (mutation) in the AKT1 gene. It is not inherited, but occurs as a random mutation in a body cell in a developing baby (fetus) early in pregnancy. The AKT1 gene mutation affects only a portion of the body cells. This is why only a portion of the body is affected and why individuals with Proteus syndrome can be very differently affected.

Proteus syndrome is caused by mutations in the AKT1 gene. This genetic change is not inherited from a parent; it arises randomly in one cell during the early stages of development before birth. As cells continue to grow and divide, some cells will have the mutation and others will not. This mixture of cells with and without a genetic mutation is known as mosaicism. The AKT1 gene helps regulate cell growth and division. (proliferation) and cell death. A mutation in this gene disrupts a cell's ability to regulate its own growth, allowing it to grow and divide abnormally. Increased cell proliferation in various tissues and organs leads to the abnormal growth characteristics of Proteus syndrome. Studies suggest that AKT1 gene mutations are more common in groups of cells that experience overgrowth than in the parts of the body that grow normally."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia joint laxity ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia joint laxity?

Most infants with thanatophoric dysplasia are stillborn or die shortly after birth from respiratory failure. A few affected individuals have survived into childhood with extensive medical help. Thanatophoric dysplasia is caused by mutations in the FGFR3 gene. While this condition is considered to be autosomal dominant, virtually all cases have occurred in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Two major forms of thanatophoric dysplasia have been described, type I and type II. Type I thanatophoric dysplasia is distinguished by the presence of curved thigh bones and flattened bones of the spine (platyspondyly).

There have been cases of MMA+HCU cblC type associated with mild symptoms and delayed age at onset (teen to adult years). In most cases however, signs and symptoms of MMA+HCU cblC type present in infancy. Even with early diagnosis and treatment, children with the condition tend to have symptoms affecting vision, growth, and learning. A recent study of 12 children with early onset MMA+HCU CblC type, diagnosed by newborn screening, and treated early with intramuscular hydroxocobalamin, oral betaine, folinic acid, l-carnitine, and dietary protein modification were reported to have developed the following symptoms: Mild to moderate low muscle tone (91%) Quick uncontrollable movements of the eye (nystagmus) with variable affect on vision (75%) Seizure (25%) Small head circumference (17%) Testing of communication, socialization, daily living skills, motor skills, and behavior showed mild to moderate delays in these areas for most children. Socialization was the least affected aspect of development. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria, type cblC.

This tumor most commonly affects children between 5 and 10 years of age; however, adults can sometimes be affected. Craniopharyngiomas are thought to arise from remnants of the craniopharyngeal duct and/or Rathke cleft or from metaplasia (abnormal transformation of cells) of squamous epithelial cell remnants of the stomadeum.[orphanet] Craniopharyngioma is treated with surgery alone or by surgery followed by radiation."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Craniopharyngioma ?","output":"What symptoms may be associated with craniopharyngioma? Craniopharyngioma causes symptoms in three different ways: by increasing the pressure on the brain (intracranial pressure) by disrupting the function of the pituitary gland by damaging the optic nerve Increased pressure on the brain causes headache, nausea, vomiting (especially in the morning), and difficulty with balance. Damage to the pituitary gland causes hormone imbalances that can lead to excessive thirst and urination (diabetes insipidus) and stunted growth. When the optic nerve is damaged by the tumor, vision problems develop. These defects are often permanent, and may be worse after surgery to remove the tumor. Most patients have at least some visual defects and evidence of decreased hormone production at the time of diagnosis."},{"instruction":"What causes Craniopharyngioma ?","output":"What causes craniopharyngioma? Craniopharyngiomas are thought to arise from epithelial remnants of the craniopharyngeal duct or Rathke's pouch (adamantinomatous type tumours) or from metaplasia of squamous epithelial cell rests that are remnants of the part of the stomadeum that contributed to the buccal mucosa (squamous papillary type tumours)."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Craniopharyngioma ?","output":"How might craniopharyngiomas be treated? Traditionally, surgery has been the main treatment for craniopharyngioma. However, radiation treatment instead of surgery may be the best choice for some patients. In tumors that cannot be removed completely with surgery alone, radiation therapy is usually necessary. If the tumor has a classic appearance on CT scan, then even a biopsy may not be necessary, if treatment with radiation alone is planned.

Nephrocalcinosis may be caused by a variety of things, including underlying disorders or conditions, medications or supplements, and infections. Causes may include: Primary hyperparathyroidism is the single most common cause of nephrocalcinosis in adults. While nephrocalcinosis is a relatively rare complication (5%), primary hyperparathryroidism is relatively common, especially in the elderly. Rarely, hyperparathyroidism can be associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1). Distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is the second most common cause of medullary nephrocalcinosis. hypervitaminosis-D states resulting from excessive treatment of hypoparathyroidism, self-administration of vitamins, and the presence of a granulomatous disease, such as sarcoidosis. Any other cause of hypercalcemia (increased calcium in the blood), particularly when associated with hypercalciuria (increased calcium in the urine). Causes include milk-alkali syndrome (due to excess ingestion of antacids), hyperparathyroidism, and malignant disease. Idiopathic hypercalciuria,a common metabolic disease, is also a known cause. Nephrocalcinosis and renal failure are increasingly being recognized as common complications of phosphate supplementation, particularly in the elderly.Phosphate supplements may contribute to renal calcifications in children with hypophosphatemic rickets. Medullary sponge kidney Rapidly progressive osteoporosis due to immobilization, menopause, aging, or steroids. Primary (familial) hyperoxaluria, or secondary hyperoxaluria due to increased intake of oxalates, increased absorption due to intestinal disease, or ingestion of ethylene glycol. Chronic disorders such as Bartter syndrome, primary hyperaldosteronism, Liddle syndrome, and 11-beta hydroxylase deficiency are associated with reduced urine citrate and tubular damage, leading to calcium deposits. Autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets and X-linked hypophosphatemic conditions, possibly due to phosphate supplementation for the condition. Premature, sick infants have been observed to develop diffuse nephrocalcinosis, typically when exposed to diuretic therapy or prolonged O 2 therapy. Other causes may include the use of certain medications such as acetazolamide; tuberculosis of the kidney; and infections related to AIDS"},{"instruction":"Nephrocalcinosis inherited ?","output":"Is nephrocalcinosis inherited? Nephrocalcinosis may be caused by a large variety of things, including underlying disorders, certain medications and supplements, and infections. Nephrocalcinosis itself is not inherited. However, the underlying condition that is causing nephrocalcinosis in an individual may be inherited. Some inherited conditions that may be associated with nephrocalcinosis in affected individuals are: Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) Familial distal renal tubular acidosis Chronic granulomatous disease Primary hyperoxaluria Bartter syndrome primary hyperaldosteronism Liddle syndrome 11-beta hydroxylase deficiency, a form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) Autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets and X-linked hypophosphatemic conditions"},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Nephrocalcinosis ?","output":"How might nephrocalcinosis be treated? Treatment of nephrocalcinosis includes treating the underlying condition causing nephrocalcinosis, if it is known. The goal of treatment is to reduce symptoms and prevent more calcium from being deposited in the kidneys. Measures are usually taken to reduce abnormal levels of calcium, phosphate, and oxalate in the blood. Medications that cause calcium loss are typically stopped. Treatment of hypercalcemia (increased calcium levels in the blood) and hypercalcemic nephropathy typically includes adequate hydration by isotonic sodium chloride (normal saline) solution to reverse hypercalcemia and protect the kidneys. Treatment of macroscopic nephrocalcinosis (calcium deposition that is visible without magnification) may include thiazide diuretics and dietary salt restriction; potassium and magnesium supplementation; and citrate supplementation in idiopathic hypercalciuria (of unknown cause) and in distal renal tubular acidosis. Lessening of nephrocalcinosis may occur over time, but in many cases, such as when it results from primary hyperoxaluria or distal renal tubular acidosis, nephrocalcinosis is largely irreversible. Therefore, early detection and treatment are important. Individuals interested in learning about treatment options for themselves should speak with their health care provider or a nephrologist."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Hepatoblastoma ?","output":"Hepatoblastoma is a rare malignant (cancerous) tumor of the liver that usually occurs in the first 3 years of life.

Klinefelter syndrome usually occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm). An error in cell division called nondisjunction results in a reproductive cell with an abnormal number of chromosomes. For example, an egg or sperm cell may gain one or more extra copies of the X chromosome as a result of nondisjunction. If one of these atypical reproductive cells contributes to the genetic makeup of a child, the child will have one or more extra X chromosomes in each of the body's cells. Most often, Klinefelter syndrome is caused by a single extra copy of the X chromosome, resulting in a total of 47 chromosomes per cell. Males normally have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome in each cell (46, XY), while females have two X chromosomes (46, XX). People with Klinefelter syndrome usually have two X chromosomes and one Y chromosome (47, XXY). Some people with Klinefelter syndrome have the extra X chromosome in only some of their cells; these people are said to have mosaic Klinefelter syndrome. It is estimated that about half of the time, the cell division error occurs during development of the sperm, while the remainder are due to errors in egg development. Women who have pregnancies after age 35 have a slightly increased chance of having offspring with this syndrome. The features of Klinefelter syndrome are due to the extra copies of genes on the extra X chromosome, which can alter male sexual development."},{"instruction":"Klinefelter syndrome inherited ?","output":"Is Klinefelter syndrome inherited?

This may include: Educational interventions - As children, many people with Klinefelter syndrome qualify for special services to help them in school. Teachers can also help by using certain methods in the classroom, such as breaking bigger tasks into small steps. Therapeutic options - A variety of therapists, such as physical, speech, occupational, behavioral, mental health, and family therapists can often help reduce or eliminate some of the symptoms of Klinefelter syndrome such as poor muscle tone; speech and language problems; or low self-confidence. Medical management - About half of people with KS have low testosterone levels, which may be raised by taking supplemental testosterone. Having a more normal testosterone level can help affected people develop bigger muscles, a deeper voice, and facial and body hair. Many healthcare providers recommend testosterone therapy when a boy reaches puberty. However, not all males with KS benefit from testosterone therapy.

Noonan syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that having one changed (mutated) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause the condition. Each child of a person with Noonan syndrome has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit the condition. In some cases, the condition is inherited from an affected parent. Because the features of the condition can vary and may be very subtle, many affected adults are diagnosed only after the birth of a more obviously affected infant. In other cases, the condition is caused by a new mutation occurring for the first time in the affected person."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Noonan syndrome ?","output":"How might Noonan syndrome be treated? Management generally focuses on the specific signs and symptoms present in each person. Treatments for the complications of Noonan syndrome (such as cardiovascular abnormalities) are generally standard and do not differ from treatment in the general population. Developmental disabilities are addressed by early intervention programs and individualized education strategies. Treatment for serious bleeding depends upon the specific factor deficiency or platelet abnormality. Growth hormone treatment increases growth velocity.

In some cases, the genes responsible have not yet been found."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose Primary Familial Brain Calcification ?","output":"How is primary familial brain calcification (PFBC) diagnosed? The diagnosis of PFBC relies upon: 1) visualization of bilateral (on both sides) calcification of the basal ganglia on neuroimaging, 2) presence of progressive neurological dysfunction, 3) absence of a metabolic, infectious, toxic, or traumatic cause, and 4) a family history consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance (a person must inherit one copy of the altered gene from one parent to have the condition). Molecular genetic testing can help confirm the diagnosis. Is there genetic testing for primary familial brain calcification (PFBC) even though not all of the causitive genes are known? Genetic testing may help to confirm the diagnosis. For individuals in who a diagnosis of PFBC is being considered, other causes of brain calcification should be eliminated prior to pursuing genetic testing, particularly in simplex cases. Testing that might be done includes biochemical analysis of blood and urine, as well s analysis of cerebrospinal fluid. If no other primary cause for brain calcification is detected or if the family history is suggestive of autosomal dominant inheritance, molecular genetic testing should be considered. Sequencing of SLC20A2 should be pursued first. If no mutation is identified, deletion/duplication analysis of SLC20A2 may be considered. If no identifiable mutation or deletion in SLC20A2 is found, sequence analysis of PDGFRB and PDGFB may be considered."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Primary Familial Brain Calcification ?","output":"How might primary familial brain calcification (PFBC) be treated? There is no standard course of treatment for PFBC. Treatment typically addresses symptoms on an individual basis. Medications may be used to improve anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, and dystonia. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) can be prescribed for seizures. Oxybutynin may be prescribed for urinary incontinence (loss of bladder control).

These enzymes are responsible for removing ammonia from the blood stream. The urea cycle involves a series of biochemical steps in which nitrogen, a waste product of protein metabolism, is changed to a compound called urea and removed from the blood. Normally, the urea is removed from the body through the urine. In urea cycle disorders, nitrogen builds up in the blood in the form of ammonia, a highly toxic substance, resulting in hyperammonemia (elevated blood ammonia). Ammonia then reaches the brain through the blood, where it can cause irreversible brain damage, coma and/or death. The onset and severity of urea cycle disorders is highly variable. The severity correlates with the amount of urea cycle enzyme function."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Tetralogy of fallot and glaucoma ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Tetralogy of fallot and glaucoma?

The infection can arise suddenly and spread quickly. Necrotizing fasciitis can be caused by several different types of bacteria. Early signs include flu-like symptoms and redness and pain around the infection site. If the infection is not treated promptly, it can lead to multiple organ failure and death. As a result, prompt diagnosis and treatment is essential. Treatment typically includes intravenous antibiotics and surgery to remove infected and dead tissue."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Necrotizing fasciitis ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of necrotizing fasciitis? Symptoms often begin within hours of an injury. Intense pain and tenderness over the affected area are often considered the hallmark symptoms of necrotizing fasciitis (NF). The pain is often described as severe and may raise suspicion of a torn muscle. Some early symptoms may be mistaken for the flu and can include fever, sore throat, stomach ache, nausea, diarrhea, chills, and general body aches. The patient may notice redness around the area which spreads quickly; the affected area can eventually become swollen, shiny, discolored, and hot to the touch. In addition, there may be ulcers or blisters. If the infection continues to spread, the patient may experience the following: dehydration, high fever, fast heart rate, and low blood pressure. Pain may actually improve as tissues and the nerves are destroyed. As the infection spreads, vital organs may be affected and the patient may become confused or delirious. If not successfully treated, NF can lead to shock and eventual death."},{"instruction":"What causes Necrotizing fasciitis ?","output":"What causes necrotizing fasciitis? Bacteria that can cause necrotizing fasciitis (NF) include the following: Klebsiella, Clostridium, and Escherichia coli; group A Streptococcus is the most common cause. Anyone can develop NF. Approximately 50% of necrotizing fasciitis cases caused by streptococcal bacteria occur in young and otherwise healthy individuals. Although necrotizing fasciitis most frequently develops after trauma that causes a break in the skin, it can also develop after minor trauma that occurs without a break in the skin. NF can occur as a complication of a surgical procedure; it can also occur at the site of a relatively minor injury such as an insect bite or an injection. In addition, underlying illnesses which weaken the immune system may increase the risk that a person will develop NF. Studies have even suggested a possible relationship between the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) during varicella infections and the development of necrotizing fasciitis."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Necrotizing fasciitis ?","output":"How might necrotizing fasciitis be treated? Accurate and prompt diagnosis, treatment with intravenous (IV) antibiotics, and surgery to remove dead tissue are all important for treating necrotizing fasciitis. Since the blood supply to the infected tissue is impaired, antibiotics cannot penetrate into the infected tissue. As a result, surgery to remove the dead, damaged, or infected tissue is the cornerstone of treatment for necrotizing fasciitis. In addition, early surgical treatment may minimize tissue loss, eliminating the need for amputation of the infected extremity. The choice of antibiotics will likely depend on the particular bacteria involved. Supplemental oxygen, fluids, and medicines may be needed to raise the blood pressure. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy and intravenous immunoglobulin may also be considered, but their use in patients with NF is considered controversial by some."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Eyebrows duplication of, with stretchable skin and syndactyly ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Eyebrows duplication of, with stretchable skin and syndactyly?

The signs and symptoms of Troyer syndrome can vary, and some people are more severely affected than others. Symptoms typically begin in early childhood. Most affected children have delays in walking and talking, followed by slow deterioration in both manner of walking (gait) and speech. Affected people have progressive muscle weakness and stiffness (spasticity) in the legs; muscle wasting in the hands and feet; paraplegia; leg contractures; learning disorders; and short stature. Mood swings and mood disorders, causing inappropriate euphoria and/or crying, are common. Other features can include drooling; exaggerated reflexes (hyperreflexia) in the legs; uncontrollable movements of the arms and legs (choreoathetosis); skeletal abnormalities; and a bending outward (valgus) of the knees. There is generally a slow, progressive decline in muscle and nerve function, and symptoms worsen over time. Most people need a wheelchair by their 50s or 60s. Affected people typically have a normal life expectancy. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Troyer syndrome.

Troyer syndrome is caused by mutations in the SPG20 gene. This gene gives the body instructions to make a protein called spartin, which is present in many body tissues, including those of the nervous system. However, the function of this protein is not fully understood. It is thought to play various roles needed for the functions of cells. Troyer syndrome is assumed to be caused by a loss of function of the spartin protein. More research on the normal functions of the spartin protein is needed to better understand exactly how mutations in the SPG20 gene cause the features of Troyer syndrome."},{"instruction":"Troyer syndrome inherited ?","output":"How is Troyer syndrome inherited? Troyer syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that to be affected, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell.

It resembles alcoholic liver disease, but occurs in people who drink little or no alcohol. The major feature in NASH is fat in the liver, along with inflammation and damage. Most people with NASH feel well and are not aware that they have a liver problem. Nevertheless, NASH can be severe and can lead to cirrhosis, in which the liver is permanently damaged and scarred and no longer able to work properly. NASH most often occurs in people who are middle aged and overweight or obese. Affected individuals may also have elevated levels of blood lipids (such as cholesterol and triglycerides) and many have diabetes or prediabetes. Treatment is centered around working towards a healthy lifestyle, including weight reduction, dietary modification, increased activity and avoidance of alcohol and unnecessary medications. The underlying cause of NASH remains unclear."},{"instruction":"What causes Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ?","output":"What causes nonalcoholic steatohepatitis? The underlying cause of NASH remains unclear. It most often occurs in persons who are middle-aged and overweight or obese. Many patients with NASH have elevated blood lipids, such as cholesterol and triglycerides, and many have diabetes or prediabetes. However, not every obese person or every patient with diabetes has NASH. Furthermore, some patients with NASH are not obese, do not have diabetes, and have normal blood cholesterol and lipids. NASH can occur without any apparent risk factor and can even occur in children. While the underlying reason for the liver injury that causes NASH is not known, several factors are possible candidates: insulin resistance release of toxic inflammatory proteins by fat cells (cytokines) oxidative stress (deterioration of cells) inside liver cells"},{"instruction":"w to diagnose Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ?","output":"How is nonalcoholic steatohepatitis diagnosed? NASH is usually first suspected when elevations are noted in liver tests that are included in routine blood test panels. These may include alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST). When further evaluation shows no apparent reason for liver disease (such as medications, viral hepatitis, or excessive use of alcohol) and when x-rays or imaging studies of the liver show fat, NASH is suspected. The only way to definitely diagnosis NASH and separate it from simple fatty liver is through a liver biopsy. For a liver biopsy, a needle is inserted through the skin to remove a small piece of the liver. NASH is diagnosed when examination of the tissue with a microscope shows fat along with inflammation and damage to liver cells. If the tissue shows fat without inflammation and damage, simple fatty liver or NAFLD is diagnosed. An important piece of information learned from the biopsy is whether scar tissue has developed in the liver. Blood tests and scans cannot reliably provide this information at this time."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ?","output":"How might nonalcoholic steatohepatitis be treated?

They are also helpful for other conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, and high cholesterol. Individuals with other medical conditions (diabetes, high blood pressure, or elevated cholesterol) should be treated with medication as advised by their physician.

Myhre syndrome is caused by mutations in the SMAD4 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in transmitting chemical signals from the cell surface to the nucleus. This signaling pathway, called the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-) pathway, allows the environment outside the cell to affect how the cell produces other proteins. As part of this pathway, the SMAD4 protein interacts with other proteins to control the activity of particular genes. These genes influence many areas of development. Some researchers believe that the SMAD4 gene mutations that cause Myhre syndrome impair the ability of the SMAD4 protein to attach (bind) properly with the other proteins involved in the signaling pathway. Other studies have suggested that these mutations result in an abnormally stable SMAD4 protein that remains active in the cell longer.

It is characterized by replacement of normal bone tissue with areas of abnormal fibrous growth (fibrous dysplasia); patches of abnormal skin coloring with jagged borders (cafe-au-lait spots); and abnormalities in the glands that regulate the body's rate of growth, sexual development, and other metabolic functions (multiple endocrine dysfunction). MAS is caused by a change (mutation) in the GNAS gene that occurs by chance very early in development. As a result, some of the body's cells have a normal version of the GNAS gene, while other cells have the mutated version. This phenomenon is called mosaicism. The severity of MAS and its features depend on the number and location of cells that have the mutated GNAS gene. Because MAS occurs by chance, it is not inherited or passed down from one generation to the next."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of McCune Albright syndrome ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of McCune Albright syndrome? People with McCune Albright syndrome (MAS) may have symptoms related to bones, the endocrine system, and/or skin. The symptoms can range from mild to severe. Bone symptoms may include: Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia: This is when normal bone is replaced by softer, fibrous tissue. Polyostotic means the abnormal areas may occur in many bones; often they are confined to one side of the body. Replacement of bone with fibrous tissue may lead to fractures, uneven growth, and deformity. When it occurs in skull and jaw it can result in uneven growth of the face. This may also occur in the long bones; uneven growth of leg bones may cause limping. Abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis) Cancer: Bone lesions may become cancerous, but this happens in less than 1% of people with MAS. Endocrine symptoms may include: Early puberty: Girls with MAS usually reach puberty early. They often have menstrual bleeding by age 2 (as early as 4-6 months in some), many years before characteristics such as breast enlargement and pubic hair growth are evident. This early onset of menstruation is believed to be caused by excess estrogen, a female sex hormone produced by cysts that develop in one of the ovaries. Less commonly, boys with MAS may also experience early puberty. Enlarged thyroid gland: The thyroid gland may become enlarged (a condition called a goiter) or develop masses called nodules. About half of affected individuals produce excessive amounts of thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism), resulting in a fast heart rate, high blood pressure, weight loss, tremors, sweating, and other symptoms. Increased production of growth hormone: The pituitary gland may produce too much growth hormone. This can result in acromegaly, a condition characterized by large hands and feet, arthritis, and distinctive facial features that are often described as \\"coarse.\\" Cushings syndrome: Rarely, individuals with MAS produce too much of the hormone cortisol in the adrenal glands. Cushing's syndrome causes weight gain in the face and upper body, slowed growth in children, fragile skin, fatigue, and other health problems. Skin symptoms may include: Cafe-au-lait spots: Individuals with MAS usually have light brown patches of skin called cafe-au-lait spots. Like the bone lesions, these spots often appear on only one side of the body. Most children have these spots from birth and the spots rarely grow. There are usually not any medical problems caused by these skin changes. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for McCune Albright syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition.

McCune Albright syndrome (MAS) is caused by a change (mutation) in the GNAS gene. This gene provides instructions for making part of a protein that ultimately influences many cell functions by regulating hormone activity. GNAS gene mutations that cause MAS result in a protein that causes the enzyme adenylate cyclase to be constantly turned on. This, in turn, leads to over-production of several hormones, resulting in the signs and symptoms of MAS."},{"instruction":"McCune Albright syndrome inherited ?","output":"Is McCune Albright syndrome inherited? McCune Albright syndrome (MAS) is not inherited. It is caused by a random change (mutation) in the GNAS gene that occurs very early in development.

The severity of this disorder and its specific features depend on the number and location of cells that have the mutated GNAS gene. This mutation is not passed on to any of the affected individual's children."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for McCune Albright syndrome ?","output":"How might McCune Albright syndrome be treated? Although there is no cure for McCune Albright syndrome (MAS), drug treatments may help some of the endocrine symptoms, and surgery can help repair some of the bone problems. Generally, treatment depends on what tissues are affected as well as the severity. Surgery may be needed to manage complications associated with fibrous dysplasia, such as progressive visual disturbance, severe pain, and severe disfigurement. Surgery may also be needed to manage associated endocrine abnormalities and/or cancers. Bisphosphonates are frequently used to treat fibrous dysplasia. Strengthening exercises are recommended to help maintain musculature around the bones and minimize the risk of fracture. Treatment of all endocrine symptoms, whether by hormone inhibitors or surgery, is commonly required. More detailed information about the management of MAS syndrome is available on Medscape Reference's Web site."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Woolly hair hypotrichosis everted lower lip and outstanding ears ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Woolly hair hypotrichosis everted lower lip and outstanding ears?

People affected by this condition generally experience \\"photosensitivity,\\" which causes painful, blistering lesions to develop on sun-exposed areas of the skin (i.e. the hands and face). Skin in these areas may also be particularly fragile with blistering and/or peeling after minor trauma. In some cases, increased hair growth as well as darkening and thickening of the affected skin may occur. Liver abnormalities may develop in some people with the condition and PCT, in general, is associated with an increased risk of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. In most cases, PCT is a complex or multifactorial condition that is likely associated with the effects of multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors. For example, factors such as excess iron, alcohol, estrogens, smoking, chronic hepatitis C, HIV and mutations in the HFE gene (which is associated with the disease hemochromatosis) can all contribute to the development of PCT. Less commonly, PCT can run in families (called familial PCT). Familial PCT is caused by changes (mutations) in the UROD gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Treatment may include regular phlebotomies (removing a prescribed amount of blood from a vein), certain medications, and/or removal of factors that may trigger the disease."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Porphyria cutanea tarda ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Porphyria cutanea tarda?

Symptoms typically appear at an average age of 28 years and may include polyuria (excessive production or passage of urine) and low urinary osmolality (decreased concentration) in the first morning urine. Later, symptoms of renal insufficiency typically progress to include anemia, metabolic acidosis and uremia. End stage renal disease (ESRD) eventually follows. There are 2 types of MCKD, which are both inherited in an autosomal dominant manner but are caused by mutations in different genes. MCKD 1 is caused by mutations in the MCKD1 gene (which has not yet been identified) and MCKD 2 is caused by mutations in the UMOD gene. The 2 types also differ by MCKD 1 being associated with ESRD at an average age of 62 years, while MCKD 2 is associated with ESRD around 32 years and is more likely to be associated with hyperuricemia and gout. Treatment for MCKD may include correction of water and electrolyte imbalances, and dialysis followed by renal transplantation for end-stage renal failure."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Medullary cystic kidney disease 1 ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Medullary cystic kidney disease 1?

The human heart normally has four chambers, two ventricles and two atria. The two atria are normally separated from each other by a partition called the atrial septum and the two ventricles by the ventricle septum. In cor triatriatum there is a small extra chamber above the left atrium (cor triatriatum sinistrum) or right atrium (cor triatriatum dextrum). The presence of this extra atrial chamber can cause slowed passage of the blood from the lungs to the heart and, over time, lead to features of congestive heart failure and obstruction. In children, cor triatriatum may be associated with major congenital cardiac problems. In adults, it is often an isolated finding.

Larson syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. A condition is autosomal dominant when having one copy of the changed (mutated) gene in each cell is enough to cause signs or symptoms of the condition. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent; in other cases, a new mutation occurs for the first time in the affected person. While some authors have suggested autosomal recessive inheritance in families with affected siblings and unaffected parents, it was found that some of these children were affected due to germline mosaicism. This means that multiple siblings in a family inherited a disease-causing mutation from an unaffected parent who had the mutation in some or all of their egg or sperm cells only (not other body cells). This can cause a condition to appear autosomal recessive. Also, some other conditions with autosomal recessive inheritance and symptoms that overlap with Larsen syndrome have been diagnosed as Larsen syndrome, but are now mostly considered different conditions. These conditions are usually more severe and due to mutations in different genes."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Cardiocranial syndrome ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Cardiocranial syndrome?

Eisenmenger syndrome usually develops before a child reaches puberty but can also develop in young adulthood."},{"instruction":"What causes Eisenmenger syndrome ?","output":"What causes Eisenmenger syndrome? Eisenmenger syndrome is caused by a defect in the heart. Most often, the defect is one called a ventricular septal defect (VSD), a hole between the two pumping chambers (the left and right ventricles) of the heart. Other heart defects that can lead to Eisenmenger syndrome include atrial septal defect (ASD) and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). The hole allows blood that has already picked up oxygen from the lungs to flow abnormally back into the lungs, instead of going out to the rest of the body. Over time, this increased blood flow can damage the small blood vessels in the lungs. This causes high blood pressure in the lungs. As a result, the blood backs up and does not go to the lungs to pick up oxygen. Instead, the blood goes from the right side to the left side of the heart, and oxygen-poor blood travels to the rest of the body."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Eisenmenger syndrome ?","output":"How might Eisenmenger syndrome be treated?

The four main symptoms are tremor, or trembling in hands, arms, legs, jaw, or head; rigidity, or stiffness of the limbs and trunk; bradykinesia, or slowness of movement; and postural instability, or impaired balance. These symptoms usually begin gradually and worsen with time. As they become more pronounced, patients may have difficulty walking, talking, or completing other simple tasks. Not everyone with one or more of these symptoms has Parkinson disease, as the symptoms sometimes appear in other diseases as well. Parkinson disease affects about 1 to 2 percent of people over the age of 60 years and the chance of developing Parkinson disease increases as we age. Although some Parkinson disease cases appear to be hereditary most cases are sporadic and occur in people with no apparent history of the disorder in their family. When three or more people are affected in a family, especially if they are diagnosed at an early age (under 50 years) there may be a gene making this family more likely to develop the condition. Currently, seven genes that cause some form of Parkinson's disease have been identified. Mutations (changes) in three known genes called SNCA (PARK1),UCHL1 (PARK 5), and LRRK2 (PARK8) and another mapped gene (PARK3) have been reported in families with dominant inheritance. Mutations in three known genes, PARK2 (PARK2), PARK7 (PARK7), and PINK1 (PARK6) have been found in affected individuals who had siblings with the condition but whose parents did not have Parkinson's disease (recessive inheritance). There is some research to suggest that these genes are also involved in early-onset Parkinson's disease (diagnosed before the age of 30) or in dominantly inherited Parkinson's disease but it is too early yet to be certain. However, in most cases inheriting a mutation will not cause someone to develop Parkinson's disease because there may be additional genes and environmental factors determining who will get the condition, when they get it and how it affects them."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Parkinson disease ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Parkinson disease?

Parkinson disease occurs when the nerve cells in the brain that make dopamine, a chemical messenger which transmits signals within the brain to produce smooth physical movements, are slowly destroyed. Without dopamine, the nerve cells in the part of the brain known as the substantia nigra cannot properly send messages. This leads to progressive loss of muscle function. Exactly why these brain cells waste away is unknown. Recent studies have shown that people with Parkinson disease also experience damage to the nerve endings that produce the neurotransmitter norepinephrine. Norepinephrine, which is closely related to dopamine, is the main chemical messenger of the sympathetic nervous system, the part of the nervous system that controls the automatic functions of the body, including pulse and blood pressure. The loss of norepinephrine may explain some of the non-motor features seen in Parkinson disease, including fatigue and problems with blood pressure regulation. More detailed information about the cause of Parkinson disease is available through an information page developed by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). Click here to view this information."},{"instruction":"Parkinson disease inherited ?","output":"Is Parkinson disease inherited? Most cases of Parkinson disease are classified as sporadic and occur in people with no apparent history of the disorder in their family. Although the cause of these cases remains unclear, sporadic cases probably result from a complex interaction of environmental and genetic factors. Additionally, certain drugs may cause Parkinson-like symptoms. Approximately 15 percent of people with Parkinson disease have a family history of the disorder. These familial cases are caused by mutations in the LRRK2, PARK2, PARK7, PINK1, or SNCA gene, or by alterations in genes that have not yet been identified. Mutations in some of these genes may also play a role in cases that appear to be sporadic. It is not fully understood how mutations in the LRRK2, PARK2, PARK7, PINK1, or SNCA gene cause Parkinson disease. Some mutations appear to disturb the cell machinery that breaks down (degrades) unwanted proteins. As a result, un-degraded proteins accumulate, leading to the impairment or death of dopamine-producing neurons. Other mutations may involve mitochondria, the energy-producing structures within cells. As a byproduct of energy production, mitochondria make unstable molecules, called free radicals, that can damage the cell. Normally, the cell neutralizes free radicals, but some gene mutations may disrupt this neutralization process. As a result, free radicals may accumulate and impair or kill dopamine-producing neurons. In some families, alterations in the GBA, SNCAIP, or UCHL1 gene appear to modify the risk of developing Parkinson disease. Researchers have identified some genetic changes that may reduce the risk of developing the disease, while other gene alterations seem to increase the risk."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose Parkinson disease ?","output":"How is Parkinson disease diagnosed?

Joubert syndrome and related disorders may be caused by changes (mutations) in any of many genes (some of which are unknown). The proteins made from these genes are either known, or thought, to affect cell structures called cilia. Cilia are projections on the cell surface that play a role in signaling. They are important for many cell types, including neurons, liver cells and kidney cells. Cilia also play a role in the senses such as sight, hearing, and smell. Mutations in the genes responsible for Joubert syndrome and related disorders cause problems with the structure and function of cilia, likely disrupting important signaling pathways during development. However, it is still unclear how specific developmental abnormalities result from these problems."},{"instruction":"Joubert syndrome inherited ?","output":"How is Joubert syndrome inherited? Joubert syndrome is predominantly inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that to be affected, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell. Affected people inherit one mutated copy of the gene from each parent, who is referred to as a carrier. Carriers of an autosomal recessive condition typically do not have any signs or symptoms (they are unaffected). When 2 carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a: 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected 50% (1 in 2) chance to be an unaffected carrier like each parent 25% chance to be unaffected and not be a carrier. In rare cases, when Joubert syndrome is caused by mutations in the OFD1 gene on the X chromosome, it is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. X-linked recessive conditions usually occur in males, who only have one X chromosome (and one Y chromosome). Females have two X chromosomes, so if they have a mutation on one X chromosome, they still have a working copy of the gene on their other X chromosome and are typically unaffected. While females can have an X-linked recessive condition, it is very rare. If a mother is a carrier of an X-linked recessive condition and the father is not, the risk to children depends on each child's sex. Each male child has a 50% chance to be unaffected, and a 50% chance to be affected Each daughter has a 50% chance to be unaffected, and a 50% chance to be an unaffected carrier If a father has the condition and the mother is not a carrier, all sons will be unaffected, and all daughters will be unaffected carriers."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Glutamate formiminotransferase deficiency ?","output":"Glutamate formiminotransferase deficiency is an inherited metabolic disorder that affects physical and mental development.

MELAS is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and is therefore transmitted by maternal inheritance (also called mitochondrial inheritance). This type of inheritance applies to all conditions caused by genes in mtDNA. Mitochondria are structures in each cell that turn molecules into energy, and each contain a small amount of DNA. Only egg cells (not sperm cells) contribute mitochondria to offspring, so only females can pass on mitochondrial mutations to their children. Conditions resulting from mutations in mtDNA can appear in every generation of a family and can affect both males and females. In most cases, people with MELAS inherit an altered mitochondrial gene from their mother. Less commonly, the condition results from a new mutation in a mitochondrial gene and occurs in an individual with no history of MELAS in the family."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy lactic acidosis and strokelike episodes ?","output":"What are the genetic testing options for mitochondrial encephalomyopathy lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS)? Genetic testing for a particular condition is typically available from only a few clinical laboratories because these conditions are rare and the tests are ordered infrequently. It is not uncommon to send DNA samples to a laboratory in another state, or even to laboratories in Canada or Europe. Genetic tests are more complicated than standard blood tests and are usually much more expensive. Due to the high cost of these tests, insurance companies may or may not provide coverage. Doctors sometimes write a letter of medical necessity to the insurance company stating why a particular test is needed, which sometimes pursuades the insurance company to cover the test. These letters state the medical benefits that a person would receive from a test, and how the test would alter a person's medical care. GeneTests lists the names of laboratories that perform genetic testing. This resource lists the contact information for the clinical laboratories conducting genetic testing for MELAS. Another option is to participate in a research study that is performing genetic testing. While the cost of testing is often covered by the research funding, the tests may be more experimental and less accurate. In addition, results may not be reported to participants, or it may take a much longer time to receive any results.

Intellectual disability-developmental delay-contractures syndrome syndrome is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner and is caused by mutations in the ZC4H2 gene. A condition is considered X-linked if the gene with the mutation that causes the disorder is located on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation must be present in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. As such, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. In X-linked recessive inheritance, a female with one mutated copy of the gene in each cell is called a carrier. She can pass on the altered gene, but usually does not experience signs and symptoms of the disorder. Rarely, female carriers of a ZC4H2 gene mutation have been reported to exhibit mild symptoms."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Alveolar capillary dysplasia ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Alveolar capillary dysplasia?

This condition is characterized by the gradual development of symptomless, small, scaling papules that spontaneously flatten and regress over a period of weeks or months. Lesions at various stages may be present at any one time. Patients with this condition often have exacerbations and relapses of the condition, which can last for months or years."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Pityriasis lichenoides chronica ?","output":"What are the symptoms of pityriasis lichenoides chronica? Pityriasis lichenoides chronica usually starts out as a small pink papule that turns a reddish-brown color. There is usually a fine, mica-like adherent scale attached to the center which can be peeled off to reveal a shiny, pinkish brown surface. Over several weeks, the spot flattens out spontaneously and leaves behind a brown mark, which fades over several months. Pityriasis lichenoides chronica most commonly occurs over the trunk, buttocks, arms and legs, but may also occur on the hands, feet, face and scalp. Unlike the acute type of pityriasis lichenoides, lesions associated with pityriasis lichenoides chronica are not painful, itchy or irritating. What symptoms are associated with pityriasis lichenoides chronica (PLC)? PLC is the milder form of pityriasis lichenoides, and the lesions associated with this form consist of small, firm, red-brown spots. Unlike PLEVA, the lesions are not irritating and have mica-like adherent scale, which can be scraped off to reveal a shiny brown surface. The spot flattens out over several weeks to leave a brown mark which fades over several months. PLC can look like psoriasis, lichen planus, or insect bites."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose Pityriasis lichenoides chronica ?","output":"How is pityriasis lichenoides chronica diagnosed? The clinical appearance of pityriasis lichenoides chronica suggests the diagnosis.

The eustachian tube is the tube that runs between the middle ear and throat and regulates the ear pressure around the ear drum. Under normal circumstances, it remains closed most of the time, opening only on occasion to equalize air pressure between the middle ear and the exterior environment. Major symptoms include distorted autophony (hearing one's own voice or breathing), echoing which may interfere with speech production, wave-like sounds, and a sensation of fullness in the ear. In severe cases, vertigo and hearing loss may occur. Over time, individuals with patulous eustachian tube may develop serious and even extreme responses to the abnormal sounds and other findings. In most cases, the cause of patulous eustachian tube is unknown. Weight loss and pregnancy may be predisposing factors. Neurologic disorders that cause muscle atrophy such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, and motor neuron disease have been implicated in some cases of patulous eustachian tube. Other cases may be associated with medications such as oral contraceptives or diuretics.

Kallmann syndrome (KS) may be inherited in an X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, or autosomal recessive manner depending on the gene(s) responsible. For example: KS due to mutations in the KAL1 gene (also called the ANOS1 gene), causing Kallmann syndrome 1, is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. KS due to mutations in the FGFR1, PROKR2, PROK2, CHD7 or FGF8 genes (causing KS types 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, respectively) is predominantly inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. KS due to mutations in PROKR2 and PROK2 can also be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. In the majority of people with KS, the family history appears to be negative (the condition occurs sporadically). However, affected people are still at risk to pass the disease-causing mutation(s) on to their children, or to have an affected child. The risk for each child to be affected depends on the genetic cause in the affected person and may be up to 50%. People with personal questions about the genetic cause and inheritance of KS are encouraged to speak with a genetic counselor or other genetics professional. The genetic cause in many cases remains unknown, and a thorough family history should be obtained to understand the mode of inheritance in each family and to aid in genetic testing and counseling.

Blurring and clouding of vision are usually the first symptoms of this disorder. These vision problems may begin in one eye or simultaneously in both eyes; if vision loss starts in one eye, the other eye is usually affected within several weeks or months. Over time, vision in both eyes worsens, often leading to severe loss of sharpness (visual acuity) and color vision. This condition mainly affects central vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces. In rare cases, other symptoms may occur such as heart arrhythmias and neurologic abnormalities (e.g., postural tremor, peripheral neuropathy, nonspecific myopathy, movement disorders), and a multiple sclerosis-like disorder. However, a significant percentage of people with a mutation that causes Leber hereditary optic neuropathy do not develop any features of the disorder. Specifically, more than 50 percent of males with a mutation and more than 85 percent of females with a mutation never experience vision loss or related medical problems. Additional factors may determine whether a person develops the signs and symptoms of this disorder. Environmental factors such as smoking and alcohol use may be involved, although studies of these factors have produced conflicting results.

Leber hereditary optic neuropathy is a condition related to changes in mitochondrial DNA. Mutations in the MT-ND1, MT-ND4, MT-ND4L, and MT-ND6 genes cause LHON. These genes are contained in mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondria are structures within cells that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. Although most DNA is packaged in chromosomes within the nucleus, mitochondria also have a small amount of their own DNA (known as mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA). The genes related to Leber hereditary optic neuropathy each provide instructions for making a protein involved in normal mitochondrial function. These proteins are part of a large enzyme complex in mitochondria that helps convert oxygen and simple sugars to energy. Mutations in any of the genes disrupt this process. It remains unclear how these genetic changes cause the death of cells in the optic nerve and lead to the specific features of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy. Click here to visit the Genetic Home Reference Web site to learn more about how mutations in these genes cause Leber hereditary optic neuropathy."},{"instruction":"Leber hereditary optic neuropathy inherited ?","output":"How is Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) inherited? Leber hereditary optic neuropathy is an inherited condition that has a mitochondrial pattern of inheritance. The gene mutations that cause this condition are found in the mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondria are inherited from a person's mother, and as a result, only females pass mitochondrial conditions on to their children. Men can be affected, but they cannot pass the condition on to their children. Often, people who develop the features of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy have no family history of the condition. Because a person may carry a mitochondrial DNA mutation without experiencing any signs or symptoms, it is hard to predict which members of a family who carry a mutation will eventually develop vision loss or other medical problems associated with Leber hereditary optic neuropathy. It is important to note that all females with a mitochondrial DNA mutation, even those who do not have any signs or symptoms, will pass the genetic change to their children."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of CharcotMarieTooth disease type 2J ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2J?

The condition appears during the first year of life as frequent fever-related (febrile) seizures. As the condition progresses, other types of seizures typically occur, including myoclonus and status epilepticus. A family history of either epilepsy or febrile seizures exists in 15 percent to 25 percent of cases. Intellectual development begins to deteriorate around age 2, and affected individuals often have a lack of coordination, poor development of language, hyperactivity, and difficulty relating to others. In 30 to 80 percent of cases, Dravet syndrome is caused by changes in the SCN1A gene, which is required for the proper function of brain cells."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Dravet syndrome ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Dravet syndrome?

The salivary glands make saliva and release it into the mouth. Saliva has enzymes that help to digest food and antibodies that help protect against infections of the mouth and throat. There are 3 pairs of major salivary glands: the parotid glands, the sublingual glands, and the submandibular glands. The National Cancer Institute provides a picture of the anatomy of the salivary glands. Some risk factors for salivary gland cancer are older age, exposure to radiation of the head and/or neck area, and family history. Signs and symptoms of the disease may include: a lump near the ear, cheek, jaw, lip, or inside of the mouth; trouble swallowing; fluid draining from the ear; numbness or weakness in the face; and on-going pain in the face. Different types of treatment are available for patients with salivary gland cancer. Some treatments are standard (currently used by physicians) and some are being tested in clinical trials (by researchers). It is suggested that patients with salivary gland cancer have their treatment planned and managed by a team of doctors who are experts in treating head and neck cancer. Although treatment depends on the stage of the cancer, typically the following three treatments are used: (1) surgery, (2) radiation therapy, and (3) chemotherapy.

Cholesterol levels in general are thought to be influenced by genetic factors. Very low levels of lipids (hypolipoproteinemia) is known to be caused by certain genetic conditions, including hypobetalipoproteinemia, abetalipoproteinemia, and chylomicron retention disease. Hypobetalipoproteinemia is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Autosomal dominant inheritance is when one mutated copy of the gene that causes a disorder in each cell is needed for a person to be affected. Each affected person usually has one affected parent. Autosomal dominant disorders tend to occur in every generation of an affected family. When a person with an autosomal dominant disorder has a child, there is a 50% chance that their child will inherit the condition. In some families the condition is due to mutations in a gene called APOB, in other families the underlying mutation has not been identified. People with this condition usually do not experience symptoms. People who inherit two hypobetalipoproteinemia gene mutations may have extremely low levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and apolipoprotein B (apoB). Some of these individuals have no symptoms while others have developed fatty liver, intestinal fat malabsorption, and neurological problems. Abetalipoproteinemia is a rare disorder with approximately 100 cases described worldwide. Mutations in the MTTP gene cause abetalipoproteinemia. It is passed through families in an autosomal recessive pattern. Click here to learn more about autosomal recessive inheritance. The signs and symptoms of abetalipoproteinemia may include failure to thrive, diarrhea, abnormal star-shaped red blood cells, and fatty, foul-smelling stools in infants, nervous system impairment in children, retinitis pigmentosa and difficulty with balance and walking in childhood or adulthood. Chylomicron retention disease is a rare condition with approximately 40 cases described worldwide and is also inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. The signs and symptoms appear in the first few months of life and may include failure to thrive, diarrhea, fatty, foul-smelling stools, and later nervous system impairment.

The signs and symptoms present in each person depend on many factors including the type of CAH, the age of diagnosis, and the sex of the affected person. For example, females with a severe form of the condition may have ambiguous genitalia at birth and if not properly diagnosed, develop dehydration, poor feeding, diarrhea, vomiting and other health problems soon after.

The signs and symptoms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) vary based on many factors including the type of CAH, the age of diagnosis and the sex of the affected person. For example, girls with the severe form of CAH may be born with ambiguous genitalia, which often allows the condition to be diagnosed before other associated health problems such as poor feeding, vomiting, dehydration, and abnormal heart beat, can develop. Males typically appear unaffected at birth even when they have a severe form of CAH and without proper diagnosis, will develop associated health problems within 2-3 weeks after birth. Both genders can experience other symptoms such as early onset of puberty, fast body growth, and premature completion of growth leading to short stature, if they are not treated in early life. People affected by milder forms may not have any signs and symptoms of CAH during childhood. In these cases, a diagnosis may not be made until adolescence or adulthood when the affected person experiences early signs of puberty or fertility problems. Females with this type may have excessive facial or body hair; irregular menstrual periods; and/or acne.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of genetic conditions that can be caused by a change (mutation) in several different genes: 21-hydroxylase deficiency is caused by mutations in the CYP21A2 gene 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency is caused by mutations in the HSD3B2 gene 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency is caused by mutations in the CYP11B1 gene Cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency is caused by mutations in the POR gene 17-hydroxylase deficiency is caused by mutations in the CYP17A1 gene Congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia is caused by mutations in the STAR gene Most of these genes encode enzymes that the adrenal glands need to make one or more hormones. The adrenal glands are cone-shaped organs that sit on top of the kidneys and are responsible for releasing various types of hormones that the body needs to function. Mutations in these genes lead to deficient levels of enzymes which cause low levels of hormones such as cortisol and/or aldosterone and an overproduction of androgens (male hormones such as testosterone). Cortisol is a hormone that affects energy levels, blood sugar levels, blood pressure, and the body's response to stress, illness, and injury. Aldosterone helps the body maintain the proper level of sodium (salt) and water and helps maintain blood pressure. Irregular levels of these hormones lead to the signs and symptoms of CAH."},{"instruction":"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia inherited ?","output":"How is congenital adrenal hyperplasia inherited? All forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that to be affected, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell. The parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not show signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose Congenital adrenal hyperplasia ?","output":"Is genetic testing avaliable for congenital adrenal hyperplasia? Yes, genetic testing is available for many of the genes known to cause congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing are possible if the disease-causing mutations in the family are known. The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) is a centralized online resource for information about genetic tests. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. How is congenital adrenal hyperplasia diagnosed? Shortly after birth, all newborns in the United States are screened for a variety of conditions, including 21-hydroxylase deficiency. This is the most common cause of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and accounts for 95% of classic CAH cases. Nonclassic CAH is not detected through newborn screening and is often not suspected until signs and symptoms of the condition begin to appear later in childhood or early adulthood. In these cases, a diagnosis of CAH is usually based on physical examination; blood and urine tests that measure hormone levels; and/or genetic testing. An X-ray may also be helpful in confirming the diagnosis in children since CAH can cause bones to grow and develop more quickly than usual (advanced bone age) ."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Congenital adrenal hyperplasia ?","output":"How might congenital adrenal hyperplasia be treated? The best treatment options for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) depend on many factors including the type of CAH and the signs and symptoms present in each person. Many people with CAH require steroids to replace the low hormones. These medications will need to be taken daily throughout life or the symptoms of CAH may return. It is important that affected people on medications be closely followed by their healthcare provider because their dose may need to be adjusted at different times in life such as periods of high stress or illness. Girls with severe CAH who are born with ambiguous genitalia may undergo surgery to ensure proper function and/or to make the genitals look more female.

Normally, through a process called fatty acid oxidation, several enzymes work in a step-wise fashion to break down (metabolize) fats and convert them to energy. People with MCADD do not have enough of an enzyme needed for the step that metabolizes a group of fats called medium-chain fatty acids. MCADD is caused by mutations in the ACADM gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment includes avoidance of fasting and of medium chain triglycerides in the diet."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Mediumchain acylcoenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency? The initial signs and symptoms of medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) typically occur during infancy or early childhood and can include vomiting, lack of energy (lethargy), and low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). In rare cases, the first episode of problems related to MCADD occurs during adulthood. The signs and symptoms of MCADD can be triggered by periods of fasting, or during illnesses such as viral infections, particularly when eating is reduced.

Mutations in the ACADM gene cause medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency. Mutations in the ACADM gene lead to inadequate levels of an enzyme called medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase. Without sufficient amounts of this enzyme, medium-chain fatty acids from food and fats stored in the body are not metabolized properly. As a result, these fats are not converted to energy, which can lead to characteristic signs and symptoms of this disorder such as lethargy and low blood sugar. Medium-chain fatty acids or partially metabolized fatty acids may accumulate in tissues and can damage the liver and brain, causing serious complications."},{"instruction":"Mediumchain acylcoenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency inherited ?","output":"How is medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency inherited?

Non-involuting congenital hemangioma (NICH) is diagnosed by taking a biopsy of the skin mark and examining the tissue under a microscope. NICH looks different under the microscope than most infantile hemangiomas because the blood vessels are arranged more irregularly. Also, the cells in an NICH do not have glucose receptors, whereas the cells of almost all hemangiomas do have glucose receptors. Finally, NICH is different from more common types of hemangiomas because NICH does not spontaneously disappear (involute).

Cri du chat syndrome is caused by a deletion of the end of the short (p) arm of chromosome 5. This chromosomal change is written as 5p-. The size of the deletion varies among affected individuals but studies suggest that larger deletions tend to result in more severe intellectual disability and developmental delay than smaller deletions. The signs and symptoms of cri du chat syndrome are probably related to the loss of multiple genes on the short arm of chromosome 5. Researchers believe that the loss of a specific gene, CTNND2, is associated with severe intellectual disability in some people with this condition. They are working to determine how the loss of other genes in this region contributes to the characteristic features of cri du chat syndrome."},{"instruction":"Cri du chat syndrome inherited ?","output":"Is cri du chat syndrome inherited? Most cases of cri du chat syndrome are not inherited. The deletion occurs most often as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early fetal development. Most affected individuals do not have a history of the disorder in their family. About 10 percent of people with cri du chat syndrome inherit the chromosome abnormality from an unaffected parent. In these cases, the parent carries a chromosomal rearrangement called a balanced translocation, in which no genetic material is gained or lost. Balanced translocations usually do not cause any health problems; however, they can become unbalanced as they are passed to the next generation. Children who inherit an unbalanced translocation can have a chromosomal rearrangement with extra or missing genetic material. Individuals with cri du chat syndrome who inherit an unbalanced translocation are missing genetic material from the short arm of chromosome 5. This results in the intellectual disability and other health problems characteristic of the disorder."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Cri du chat syndrome ?","output":"How might cri du chat syndrome be treated? While there is no specific treatment available for cri du chat syndrome, early intervention is recommended in the areas of physical therapy (achieving physical and motor milestones such as sitting and standing up), communication (speech therapy, sign language instruction), behavioral modification (for hyperactivity, short attention span, aggression), and learning (special education). Because symptoms may vary from individual to individual, we recommend discussing these options with a health care professional to develop a personalized plan for therapy."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Complement component 2 deficiency ?","output":"Complement component 2 deficiency (C2D) is a genetic condition that affects the immune system.

This condition, also known as classic citrullinemia, belongs to a class of genetic diseases called urea cycle disorders. In most cases, the condition becomes evident in the first few days of life. Affected infants typically appear normal at birth, but as ammonia builds up in the body they experience a progressive lack of energy (lethargy), poor feeding, vomiting, seizures, and loss of consciousness. Citrullinemia type I is caused by mutations in the ASS1 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Citrullinemia type I ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Citrullinemia type I? Citrullinemia type I presents as a clinical spectrum that includes an acute neonatal form, a milder late-onset form, a form without symptoms and/or hyperammonemia, and a form in which women have onset of severe symptoms during pregnancy or post partum. Infants with the acute neonatal form typically appear normal at birth, but as ammonia builds up in the body they become progressively lethargic, feed poorly, vomit, and develop signs of increased intracranial pressure, which can lead to seizures and loss of consciousness. Less commonly, a milder form of citrullinemia type I can develop later in childhood or adulthood. This later-onset form is associated with intense headaches, partial loss of vision, slurred speech, problems with balance and muscle coordination (ataxia), behavior problems, and lethargy. Episodes of high blood ammonia often happen after going without food for long periods of time, during illness or infection or after high-protein meals. Some people with gene mutations that cause citrullinemia type I never experience signs and symptoms of the disorder and are only found to be affected after a brother or sister is diagnosed.

Citrullinemia type I is caused by mutations in the ASS1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme, argininosuccinate synthetase 1, that is responsible for the third step in the urea cycle. Mutations in the ASS1 gene reduce the activity of the enzyme, which disrupts the urea cycle and prevents the body from processing nitrogen effectively. Excess nitrogen (in the form of ammonia) and other byproducts of the urea cycle accumulate in the bloodstream. Ammonia is particularly toxic to the nervous system, which helps explain the neurologic symptoms (such as lethargy, seizures, and ataxia) that are often seen in this condition."},{"instruction":"Citrullinemia type I inherited ?","output":"How is citrullinemia type I inherited?

Schimke immunoosseous dysplasia is characterized by short stature, kidney disease, and a weakened immune system. In people with this condition, short stature is caused by flattened spinal bones (vertebrae), resulting in a shortened neck and trunk. Adult height is typically between 3 and 5 feet. Kidney (renal) disease often leads to life-threatening renal failure and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Affected individuals also have a shortage of certain immune system cells called T cells. T cells identify foreign substances and defend the body against infection. A shortage of T cells causes a person to be more susceptible to illness. Other features frequently seen in people with this condition include an exaggerated curvature of the lower back (lordosis); darkened patches of skin (hyperpigmentation), typically on the chest and back; and a broad nasal bridge with a rounded tip of the nose. Less common signs and symptoms of Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia include an accumulation of fatty deposits and scar-like tissue in the lining of the arteries (atherosclerosis), reduced blood flow to the brain (cerebral ischemia), migraine-like headaches, an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism), decreased numbers of white blood cells (lymphopenia), underdeveloped hip bones (hypoplastic pelvis), abnormally small head size (microcephaly), a lack of sperm (azoospermia) in males, and irregular menstruation in females.

Pyruvate carboxylase deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that both copies of the disease-causing gene in each cell (usually one inherited from each parent) must have a mutation for an individual to be affected. Individuals who carry one mutated copy of the gene are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not have any signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers for an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be an unaffected carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% risk to not have the condition and not be a carrier (i.e. to inherit both normal genes). In other words, each child born to two carriers has a 75% (3 in 4) chance to be unaffected. De novo mutations (new mutations that occur for the first time in an individual and are not inherited from a parent) have been reported for this condition. This means that in some cases, an affected individual may have only one parent who is a carrier for the condition. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk may be possible through laboratories offering custom mutation analysis if the disease-causing mutations in a family are known. Individuals interested in learning more about genetic risks to themselves or family members, or about genetic testing for this condition, should speak with a genetics professional."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Zellweger spectrum ?","output":"Zellweger spectrum refers to a group of related conditions that have overlapping signs and symptoms and affect many parts of the body. The spectrum includes Zellweger syndrome (ZS), the most severe form; neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD), an intermediate form; and infantile Refsum disease (IRD), the least severe form. Signs and symptoms of ZS typically become apparent in the newborn period and may include hypotonia, feeding problems, hearing and vision loss, seizures, distinctive facial characteristics, and skeletal abnormalities. Individuals with ZS often do not survive past the first year of life. The features of NALD and IRD often vary in nature and severity, and may not become apparent until late infancy or early childhood. Individuals with NALD or IRD may have hypotonia, vision and/or hearing problems, liver dysfunction, developmental delay and learning disabilities. Most individuals with NALD survive into childhood, and those with IRD may reach adulthood. Conditions in the Zellweger spectrum are caused by mutations in any of at least 12 genes and are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment typically focuses on the specific signs and symptoms present in each individual."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Autosomal dominant deafnessonychodystrophy syndrome ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Autosomal dominant deafness-onychodystrophy syndrome?

The most common signs and symptoms of alcohol intolerance are stuffy nose and skin flushing. Alcohol intolerance is caused by a genetic condition in which the body is unable to break down alcohol efficiently, usually found in Asians. These individuals accumulate acetaldehyde, the primary metabolite of ethanol, because of a genetic polymorphism of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) that metabolizes acetaldehyde to nontoxic acetate.[9184] The only way to prevent alcohol intolerance reactions is to avoid alcohol. Alcohol intolerance isn't an allergy. However, in some cases, what seems to be alcohol intolerance may be a reaction to something in an alcoholic beverage, such as chemicals, grains or preservatives. Combining alcohol with certain medications also can cause reactions. In rare instances, an unpleasant reaction to alcohol can be a sign of a serious underlying health problem that requires diagnosis and treatment."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Acute alcohol sensitivity ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Acute alcohol sensitivity ?

Connective tissue provides strength and flexibility to structures throughout the body such as bones, ligaments, muscles, walls of blood vessels, and heart valves. Marfan syndrome affects most organs and tissues, especially the skeleton, lungs, eyes, heart, and the large blood vessel that distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the body (the aorta). It is caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called fibrillin-1. Marfan syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. At least 25% of cases are due to a new mutation. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Marfan syndrome ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Marfan syndrome? The signs and symptoms of Marfan syndrome vary widely in severity, timing of onset, and rate of progression. Affected individuals often are tall and lean, have elongated fingers and toes (arachnodactyly), and have an arm span that exceeds body height. Other common features include unusually flexible joints, a long and narrow face, a highly arched roof of the mouth and crowded teeth, an abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis), and either a sunken chest (pectus excavatum) or a protruding chest (pectus carinatum). About half of people with Marfan syndrome have a dislocated lens (ectopia lentis) in one or both eyes, and most have some degree of nearsightedness (myopia). Clouding of the lens (cataract) may occur in mid adulthood, and increased pressure within the eye (glaucoma) occurs more frequently than in people without Marfan syndrome. Most people with Marfan syndrome have abnormalities of the heart and the aorta. Leaks in valves that control blood flow through the heart can cause shortness of breath, fatigue, and an irregular heartbeat felt as skipped or extra beats (palpitations). If leakage occurs, it usually affects the mitral valve, which is a valve between two chambers of the heart, or the aortic valve that regulates blood flow from the heart into the aorta. The first few inches of the aorta can weaken and stretch, which may lead to a bulge in the blood vessel wall (an aneurysm). The increased size of the aorta may cause the aortic valve to leak, which can lead to a sudden tearing of the layers in the aorta wall (aortic dissection). Aortic aneurysm and dissection can be life threatening. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Marfan syndrome.

The underlying cause of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is poorly understood. However, episodes often begin after a pregnancy, major surgery, trauma, or a viral illness and may increase right before a menstrual period. Many researchers suspect that there may be more than one cause for the condition. The following abnormalities can be associated with POTS and may play a role in the development of the condition: Peripheral denervation - reduced nerve stimulation to certain muscles. The lower extremities are generally most affected in people with POTS. Hypovolemia - an abnormal decrease or redistribution of blood in the body Changes in venous function - more specifically, a reduction in the volume of blood that returns to the heart (venous return) when moving from a lying down to a standing position Cardiovascular deconditioning - changes in cardiovascular function Baroreflex abnormalities - the baroreflexes play an important role in blood pressure regulation. When they sense a change in blood pressure, the heart rate is adjusted and the sympathetic nerve system fibers are activated to cause the blood vessels to narrow. Increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system Although most cases of POTS appear to occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition, some affected people report a family history of orthostatic intolerance (an excessively reduced volume of blood returns to the heart when moving from a lying down to a standing position). This suggests that genetic factors may play a role in the development of POTS in some cases. Some studies also suggest that polymorphisms in certain genes (NOS3, ADRB2) may be associated with an increased risk of developing the condition and a change (mutation) in the norepinephrine transporter gene (SLC6A2) has been identified in one family with POTS."},{"instruction":"Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome inherited ?","output":"Is postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome inherited?

Unfortunately, CREST syndrome has no known cure. The condition carries both physical and psychological consequences, so a holistic approach to management should be taken. Treatment generally focuses on relieving signs and symptoms and preventing complications. Heartburn may be relieved by antacid medications that reduce the production of stomach acid. Medications that open small blood vessels and increase circulation may help relieve Raynaud's symptoms and reduce increased pressure in the arteries between the heart and lungs. Drugs that suppress the immune system have shown promise in preventing interstitial lung disease (a condition in which excess collagen collects in the tissue between the lungs' air sacs) in some people with CREST syndrome. To prevent loss of mobility, stretching exercises for the finger joints are important. A physical therapist can also show affected individuals some facial exercises that may help keep the face and mouth flexible. If CREST syndrome is making it difficult to perform daily tasks, an occupational therapist can help individuals learn new ways of doing things. For example, special toothbrushes and flossing devices can make it easier to care for the teeth. Surgery may be necessary for some affected individuals. Large or painful calcium deposits sometimes need to be surgically removed, and amputation of fingertips may be necessary if skin ulcers progress to gangrene. Depression affects approximately 45% of patients with systemic sclerosis and 64% also develop anxiety, so early assessment and treatment of these psychological issues is recommended. For pain management, studies have shown that oxycodone is effective and safe for pain due to severe skin ulcers, while topical lidocaine helps reduce pain of digital ulcers in individuals with systemic scleroderma. \` There are also some lifestyle changes and home remedies that may be helpful for some individuals with CREST syndrome. To reduce Raynaud's symptoms, individuals may consider wearing gloves or mittens outdoors when the weather is cool, and indoors when reaching into the freezer, for example. To maintain the body's core temperature, individuals may dress in layers and wear a hat or scarf, thermal socks, and well-fitting boots or shoes that don't cut off the circulation. Individuals who smoke should talk to their doctor about the best ways to quit. Nicotine constricts the blood vessels, making Raynaud's phenomenon worse. Individuals who have difficulty swallowing may consider choosing soft, moist foods and chewing food well. To minimize acid reflux individuals may eat small, frequent meals; avoid spicy or fatty foods, chocolate, caffeine, and alcohol; and avoid exercising immediately before or after eating. Sitting upright for a couple of hours after a meal may also help. To help keep skin soft, individuals may avoid harsh soaps and detergents, while choosing gentle skin cleansers and bath gels with added moisturizers. Individuals may also consider bathing less frequently and taking brief baths and showers, using warm rather than hot water. Moisture levels in the home may be improved by using a humidifier to ease skin and breathing symptoms.

Another common cause, exclusive to women, is childbirth. The other most common cause of the condition is pregnancy. During the last three months of pregnancy, certain hormones are released in the women's body causing the area between the sacrum and the coccyx to soften and become more mobile. The increased mobility may result in permanent stretching and change and causing inflammation of the tissues surrounding the coccyx. In about one third of all cases of coccygodynia, the cause is unknown.

Common eye symptoms include cornea defects, which is the clear covering on the front of the eye, and iris defects, which is the colored part of the eye. People with this syndrome may have an off-center pupil (corectopia) or extra holes in the eyes that can look like multiple pupils (polycoria). About 50% of people with this syndrome develop glaucoma, which is a serious condition that increases pressure inside of the eye. This may cause vision loss or blindness. Click here to view a diagram of the eye. Even though Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome is primarily an eye disorder, this syndrome is also associated with symptoms that affect other parts of the body. Most people with this syndrome have distinctive facial features and many have issues with their teeth, including unusually small teeth (microdontia) or fewer than normal teeth (oligodontia). Some people have extra folds of skin around their belly button, heart defects, or other more rare birth defects. There are three types of Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome and each has a different genetic cause. Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome type 1 is caused by spelling mistakes (mutations) in the PITX2 gene.

Diagnosis of Fowlers syndrome involves ruling out neurological or laboratory features that would support a diagnosis of a underlying neurological disease, and identification of a bladder capacity of over 1 liter with no sensation of urgency. Also in Fowlers syndrome, analysis of the striated muscle of the urethral sphincter using concentric needle electrode examination reveals a fairly unique electromyographic (EMG) abnormality. This EMG abnormality is found in association with the urethral sphincter (group of muscles which surround the urinary passage below the bladder), and consists of a type of activity that would be expected to cause inappropriate contraction of the muscle (i.e., impair sphincter relaxation)."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Fowler's syndrome ?","output":"How might Fowlers syndrome be treated? The urinary incontinence caused by Fowlers syndrome may be treated by sacral neuromodulation therapy. The success rate for treatment of Fowlers syndrome with neuromodulation has been estimated to be around 70%, even in women who have been experiencing symptoms for a while. Neuromodulation therapy involves the stimulation of nerves to the bladder leaving the spine. The FDA has approved a device called InterStim for this purpose. Your doctor will need to test to determine if this device would be helpful to you. The doctor applies an external stimulator to determine if neuromodulation works in you. If you have a 50 percent reduction in symptoms, a surgeon will implant the device. Although neuromodulation can be effective, it is not for everyone. The therapy is expensive, involving surgery with possible surgical revisions and replacement. Other treatments that have been tried with little success include hormonal manipulation, pharmacologic therapy, and injections of botulinum toxin."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Nestorguillermo progeria syndrome ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Nestor-guillermo progeria syndrome?

Individuals with this condition have an unusually small and underdeveloped cerebellum, which is the part of the brain that coordinates movement. A region of the brain called the pons also fails to develop properly. The pons, which is located at the base of the brain in an area called the brainstem, transmits signals from the cerebellum to the rest of the brain. Individuals with PCH1 also experience a degeneration of the anterior horn cells. Because of the anterior horn cell involvement, this condition bears a resemblance to infantile spinal muscular atrophy, with severe muscle weakness. Other signs and symptoms of PCH1 include very weak muscle tone (hypotonia), joint deformities called contractures, a small head size (microcephaly), and breathing problems that are present at birth. Mutations in the VRK1 gene have been identified in at least one family with PCH1. The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.

Determine the arithmetic mean of all such ( a_X ). **Solution:** 1. **Define Subsets and Their Corresponding Expressions:**    - Consider any non-empty subset ( X subset M ).    - Define       [      X' = {1001 - x mid x in X}.      ]      This transformation is essentially a reflection of ( X ) with respect to the midpoint of the range ( 1 ) to ( 1000 ).    2. **Properties of Transformation ( X' ):**    - If ( X neq X' ), we see that ( X neq X_1 Rightarrow X' neq X_1' ). This indicates that ( X ) and ( X' ) are distinct unless ( X ) is symmetric about the midpoint.    - For subsets ( X ) that are symmetric such that ( X = X' ), the elements must satisfy ( x + (1001 - x) = 1001 ). Hence:      [      a_X = max(X) + min(X) = 1001.      ] 3. **Behavior when ( X neq X' ):**    - For non-symmetric subsets ( X ) and their corresponding subsets ( X' ), consider both.

Let ( x_3 ) and ( x_4 ) be roots of the quadratic equation (ax^2 + px + q = 0). Again, using Viète's formulas, the sum of the roots is:    [    x_3 + x_4 = -frac{p}{a}    ] 4. The total sum of all the roots of the two quadratic equations (ax^2 + bx + d = 0) and (ax^2 + px + q = 0) is:    [    x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = -frac{b}{a} - frac{p}{a}    ] 5. Substitute the sum ( p + b ) computed in step 1:    [    x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = -frac{b}{a} - frac{p}{a} = -frac{b + p}{a} = -frac{-2020a}{a} = 2020    ] # Conclusion: The sum of the roots of the given quadratic equations is: [ boxed{2020} ]"},{"instruction":"An archer needs to practice.

Given that the archer recovers 20% of his arrows, it means he loses 80% of his arrows every time he shoots. Therefore, the cost for the arrows he loses per shot is 80% of 5.5, which is 0.8 * 5.5 = 4.4. The team agrees to pay for 70% of the cost of his arrows, so the archer pays 30% of the cost himself. The cost the archer bears per lost arrow is 30% of 4.4, which is 0.3 * 4.4 = 1.32. The archer spends 1056 a week on arrows, and since he bears 1.32 per lost arrow, the number of shots he shoots per week is 1056 / 1.32. Let's calculate that: 1056 / 1.32 = 800 shots per week. Since he shoots 4 days a week, the number of shots he shoots per day is 800 shots per week / 4 days per week. Let's calculate that: 800 shots per week / 4 days per week = 200 shots per day.

However, not all sets of three points will form a triangle (some may be collinear), and some triangles will be congruent to others.  Step 2: Analyze cases of triangles We categorize the triangles based on their congruence to specific reference triangles: **Case 1: Triangles congruent to triangle RST** - Only triangle RST itself fits this description. **Case 2: Triangles congruent to triangle SYZ** - These triangles are formed by choosing one vertex from triangle RST and two midpoints from the sides not touching the chosen vertex. The triangles are triangle SYZ, triangle RXY, triangle TXZ, and triangle XYZ. **Case 3: Triangles congruent to triangle RSX** - These triangles are formed by choosing two vertices from triangle RST and one midpoint from the side connecting these two vertices.

By the angle bisector theorem, (BD) is the angle bisector of (angle ABC), thus:    [    angle ABD = angle DBC = 20^circ.    ] 3. Construct point (E) on (BC) such that (EC = AD). 4. We want to show that (BE = BD). If proven, we will have BC = BE + EC and thus BC = BD + AD. 5. Given (E) on (BC) with (EC = AD), we need to prove (triangle BEC cong triangle BDC). 6. In triangle BDE, since E lies on BC and EC = AD, regarding angle ABD = 20^circ, we know:    [    angle BED = 180^circ - angle ABD - angle EDB = 180^circ - 20^circ - 80^circ = 80^circ.    ] 7. In triangle triangle ACD, we have:    [    angle ADC = frac{1}{2} times angle BAC = frac{1}{2} times 100^circ = 50^circ.    ] 8. Hence,    [    angle EDC = angle BED - angle ACB = 80^circ - 40^circ = 40^circ.    ] 9. Since (EC = AD) and (angle EDC = angle ACB = 40^circ), we conclude that:    [    angle DAE = angle DEA = 40^circ.    ] 10. Consequently, (angle DAE = angle DEA) implies that (DAE) is isosceles with (DE = DA), and with (DA = AD), which follows by construction, thus making triangles congruent. 11. Upon proving (angle DAE = angle DEA), we establish:     [     boxed{BC = BD + AD},     ] because each respective angle and length maintains the balance as per the angle bisector relationship. Since the relationships are consistent, the required proof is thus established as: (boxed{BC = BD + AD})."},{"instruction":"the polar coordinate system, the maximum distance from a point on the circle ρ=8sin θ to the line θ=frac{π}{3} (ρ∈R) is ______.","output":"The circle ρ=8sin θ can be converted to ρ^2=8ρsin θ, which simplifies to x^2+y^2=8y, or (x^2+(y-4)^2=16).

If the radius is reduced by a certain percentage, the area will also be reduced. Let's denote the original radius as ( r ) and the reduced radius as ( r' ). If the radius is reduced by ( x % ), then the reduced radius ( r' ) can be expressed as ( r' = r(1 - frac{x}{100}) ). The original area of the circle is ( A = pi r^2 ), and the new area after the reduction is ( A' = pi (r')^2 ). Given that the area is reduced by 18.999999999999993%, we can express the new area as ( A' = A(1 - 0.18999999999999993) ). Now, we can set up the equation relating the original and new areas using the reduced radius: ( A' = pi (r(1 - frac{x}{100}))^2 ) ( A' = pi r^2 (1 - frac{x}{100})^2 ) Since ( A' = A(1 - 0.18999999999999993) ), we can equate the two expressions for ( A' ): ( pi r^2 (1 - frac{x}{100})^2 = pi r^2 (1 - 0.18999999999999993) ) We can cancel out ( pi r^2 ) from both sides of the equation: ( (1 - frac{x}{100})^2 = 1 - 0.18999999999999993 ) Now, we take the square root of both sides to solve for ( 1 - frac{x}{100} ): ( 1 - frac{x}{100} = sqrt{1 - 0.18999999999999993} ) ( 1 - frac{x}{100} = sqrt{0.8100000000000001} ) ( 1 - frac{x}{100} approx 0.9 ) (since the square root of 0.81 is 0.9) Now, we solve for ( x ): ( frac{x}{100} = 1 - 0.9 ) ( frac{x}{100} = 0.1 ) ( x = 0.1 times 100 ) ( x = 10 ) Therefore, the radius was reduced by boxed{10%} ."},{"instruction":"There are several circles, squares, and triangles drawn on a board.

The operation of replacing two figures with a third one will be denoted by circ. According to the problem, we have the following replacement rules:    [    begin{aligned}    O circ O &= O, & O circ K = K circ O = K     K circ K &= T, & O circ T = T circ O = T     T circ T &= K, & T circ K = K circ T = O     end{aligned}    ] 2. **Properties of the Operation:**    From the table, we observe that the operation is commutative, i.e., A circ B = B circ A for any figures A and B. It is also quite straightforward to show that the operation is associative, i.e., for any figures A, B, and C, the following equation holds:    [    (A circ (B circ C)) = ((A circ B) circ C)    ]    We leave the verification of this fact to the reader. 3. **Number of Figures and Final Reduction:**    Suppose we have n figures, among which there are n_1 circles, n_2 triangles, and n_3 squares. Regardless of the order in which operations are performed, the associative and commutative properties of circ ensure that the final result is the same. Any procedure will eventually reduce to the expression:    [    (underbrace{O circ ldots circ O}_{n_1}) circ (underbrace{T circ ldots circ T}_{n_2}) circ (underbrace{K circ ldots circ K}_{n_3})    ] 4. **Reduction for n = 3:**    For n = 3, this follows directly from the replacement rules given. To generalize, we perform an inductive argument transitioning from n to n+1 figures.     The base case with n=3 clearly follows from the specific combinations. Assuming the property holds for n, we add one more figure and apply the replacement operations, which will simplify similarly due to the associativity and commutativity. **Conclusion:**    Therefore, as the sequence of operations and their resulting sequence is deterministic due to the commutative and associative properties of the operations defined, the final remaining figure does not depend on the order of operations but only on the initial count of each type of figure.

We are told that 351 students failed the examination, which represents 65% of the total number of students. To find the total number of students, we can set up the following equation: ( 65% ) of ( T ) = 351 ( 0.65 times T = 351 ) Now, we can solve for ( T ): ( T = frac{351}{0.65} ) ( T = 540 ) Therefore, boxed{540}  students appeared for the examination."},{"instruction":"A gardener grows cabbages in her garden that is in the shape of a square.

How many square feet of area does each cabbage take in her garden?","output":"Let's denote the side length of the square area used for growing cabbages last year as ( x ) and the side length of the square area used this year as ( y ). Since the number of cabbages grown is proportional to the area of the square, we can say that the number of cabbages is equal to the square of the side length of the garden (assuming one cabbage per unit area). So, for last year, the number of cabbages grown would be ( x^2 ), and for this year, it would be ( y^2 ). We know that this year she grew 10,000 cabbages, so: [ y^2 = 10,000 ] We also know that she increased her output by 199 cabbages compared to last year, so: [ y^2 = x^2 + 199 ] Since ( y^2 = 10,000 ), we can substitute that into the second equation: [ 10,000 = x^2 + 199 ] Now, we solve for ( x^2 ): [ x^2 = 10,000 - 199 ] [ x^2 = 9,801 ] Since ( x^2 ) represents the number of cabbages grown last year, we can find ( x ) by taking the square root of ( x^2 ): [ x = sqrt{9,801} ] [ x = 99 ] So, the side length of the square area used last year was 99 units, and this year it is ( sqrt{10,000} = 100 ) units. Now, to find the area that each cabbage takes, we divide the total area by the number of cabbages.

Therefore, to find the value of the middle letter before the word score was tripled, we subtract the points of the first and third letters from the total score before tripling: [ text{Value of middle letter} = text{Word score before tripling} - text{Value of first letter} - text{Value of third letter} ] [ text{Value of middle letter} = 10 - 1 - 1 = 8 ] Therefore, the value of the middle letter before the word score was tripled was boxed{8} points."},{"instruction":"ain 150 metres long is moving at a speed of 25 kmph . it will cross a man coming from the opposite direction at a speed of 2 km per hour in","output":"To find out how long it will take for the train to cross the man, we need to calculate the relative speed between the train and the man. Since they are moving in opposite directions, we add their speeds together. The speed of the train is 25 km/h, and the speed of the man is 2 km/h. So, the relative speed is: 25 km/h + 2 km/h = 27 km/h Now, we need to convert this speed into meters per second because the length of the train is given in meters. We know that 1 km/h is equal to 1000 meters/3600 seconds (since there are 1000 meters in a kilometer and 3600 seconds in an hour). So, 27 km/h in meters per second is: 27 km/h * (1000 meters / 3600 seconds) = 27 * (1000 / 3600) m/s 27 * (10 / 36) m/s 27 * (5 / 18) m/s (27 * 5) / 18 m/s 135 / 18 m/s 7.5 m/s Now that we have the relative speed in meters per second, we can calculate the time it takes for the train to cross the man using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed The distance to be covered is the length of the train, which is 150 meters.

In this case, the boat sinks by 1 cm when the man gets on it, which means the volume of water displaced by the boat is equal to the volume of the boat that sinks below the waterline due to the man's weight. First, we need to calculate the volume of water displaced by the boat when the man gets on it. The volume of water displaced (V) can be calculated using the formula: V = L x B x h where L is the length of the boat, B is the breadth of the boat, and h is the height by which the boat sinks. Given: L = 7 m B = 2 m h = 1 cm = 0.01 m (since 1 cm = 0.01 m) Now, let's calculate the volume: V = 7 m x 2 m x 0.01 m V = 0.14 m³ The volume of water displaced is 0.14 cubic meters. Next, we need to find the mass of the water displaced, which is equal to the mass of the man. The mass of the water displaced (m) can be calculated using the formula: m = ρ x V where ρ is the density of water and V is the volume of water displaced. The density of water (ρ) is approximately 1000 kg/m³.

Let us consider the equation frac{1}{8} = frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y}, where x and y are natural numbers greater than 8 (since x > 8 and y > 8). This is because frac{1}{8} is a unit fraction itself and it needs to be expressed as the sum of two distinct unit fractions. 2. Let x = 8 + m and y = 8 + n, where m neq n, and m, n in mathbb{N}.

We can plug these values into the equation and solve for x (items in both A and B): 192 = 107 + 49 - x + 59 Now, let's solve for x: 192 = 215 - x (combining the numbers) 192 - 215 = -x (subtracting 215 from both sides) -23 = -x (simplifying) x = 23 (dividing both sides by -1) Therefore, there are boxed{23}  members of set U that are members of both sets A and B."},{"instruction":"Calculate the definite integral:  int_{pi / 2}^{0} 2^{8} cdot sin ^{4} x cos ^{4} x , dx","output":"1.

Therefore, either the smallest positive element or the largest negative element must lie in the interval ( (-(sqrt{3} + 1)/2, (sqrt{3} + 1)/2) ).    - This implies that the distance of any two consecutive elements ( |a - bsqrt{3}| ) in the set cannot be smaller than ( (sqrt{3} + 1) / 2 ). 4. This reasoning means that ( (sqrt{3} + 1) / 2 ) is an upper bound for ( alpha_n ). 5. Suppose ( a_n ) and ( b_n ) are non-negative integers such that ( a_n + b_n = n ) and ( |a_n - b_nsqrt{3}| = alpha_n ).    - Consider all values ( a_n - b_nsqrt{3} ) and observe that they all lie in the interval ( (-(sqrt{3} + 1)/2, (sqrt{3} + 1)/2) ). 6. For any ( epsilon > 0 ), it is possible to find distinct values ( m ) and ( n ) such that ( alpha_{m-n} < epsilon ).     - This is because as ( n ) approaches infinity, the differences become arbitrarily small due to the properties of the irrational number ( sqrt{3} ). 7. Now consider the sequence ( alpha_{m-n}, alpha_{2(m-n)}, alpha_{3(m-n)}, ldots ). For ( k alpha_{m-n} < (sqrt{3} + 1)/2 ), we have ( alpha_{k(m-n)} = k alpha_{m-n} ). 8. Since ( alpha_{m-n} ) can be made smaller than any ( epsilon ), the sequence ( k alpha_{m-n} ) creates a set of values that are arbitrarily close to ( (sqrt{3} + 1) / 2 ).    - Therefore, the least upper bound (supremum) of ( alpha_n ) must be ( (sqrt{3} + 1) / 2 ).

So we reformulate our conditions under this restriction. This reduces the inequality to the distance squared between the point ((-3 - 2 sin theta cos theta, -a sin theta - a cos theta)) and the line y = x:   [   (x + 3 + 2 sin theta cos theta)^2 + (y + a sin theta + a cos theta)^2 geqslant frac{1}{8}.   ]   Since x = y, it simplifies to:   [   (x - (-3 - 2 sin theta cos theta))^2 + (x - (-a sin theta - a cos theta))^2 geqslant frac{1}{8}.   ] 2. **Translate to a distance problem**: The problem translates to finding the minimum value of the squared distance from point ((-3 - 2 sin theta cos theta, -a sin theta - a cos theta)) to the line y = x.

Must ( P ) be constant?","output":"The problem states that for every positive integer (n), the sum of the decimal digits of (|P(n)|) is not a Fibonacci number. We need to determine if (P) must be constant. The answer is yes, and to prove this, we rely on two critical claims. 1. **Claim 1**: If (P(x) in mathbb{Z}[x]) is nonconstant with a positive leading coefficient, then there exists an integer polynomial (F(x)) such that all coefficients of (P circ F(x)) are positive except for the second one, which is negative.  **Proof of Claim 1**:    We will construct a cubic polynomial (F(x)) to meet this requirement. Consider the polynomial (T_0(x) = x^3 + x + 1).    - Observe that the polynomial (T_0^{deg P}(x)) will have all positive coefficients except for the second one, which is zero.    Next, consider the polynomial (T_1(x)) defined as:    [    T_1(x) = x^3 - frac{1}{D}x^2 + x + 1    ]    As (D to infty), the polynomial (T_1^{deg P}(x)) has a negative coefficient (-frac{3}{D} x^{3deg P - 1}). When (D) is sufficiently large, the polynomial (T_1^{deg P}(x)) is \\"good\\": all coefficients are positive except the second one.     Finally, let (F(x) = CT_1(x)), where (C) is a sufficiently large multiple of (D). Thus, (F(x)) makes the coefficients of ((CT_1(x))^{deg P}) dominant and integers, ensuring the required properties. 2. **Claim 2**: There are infinitely many Fibonacci numbers in each residue class modulo 9. **Proof of Claim 2**:    The Fibonacci sequence is periodic modulo any integer, including 9. We can allow negative indices and consider the residues modulo 9:    [    begin{array}{ll}    F_0 = 0 equiv 0 pmod{9}, & F_1 = 1 equiv 1 pmod{9},     F_2 = 1 equiv 1 pmod{9}, & F_3 = 2 equiv 2 pmod{9},     F_4 = 3 equiv 3 pmod{9}, & F_5 = 5 equiv 5 pmod{9},     F_6 = 8 equiv 8 pmod{9}, & F_7 = 13 equiv 4 pmod{9},     F_{-1} = -1 equiv 8 pmod{9}, & F_{-2} = 1 equiv 1 pmod{9},     F_{-3} = 0 equiv 0 pmod{9}, & F_{-4} = -3 equiv 6 pmod{9},     F_{-5} = -8 equiv 1 pmod{9}.    end{array}    ]        This shows at least one Fibonacci number for each residue class modulo 9, thus proving the claim. **Solution to the Problem**: Using the above claims, assume without loss of generality that (P) meets the conditions of the first claim and select (F) accordingly. We then have: [ P(F(x)) = c_N x^N - c_{N-1} x^{N-1} + c_{N-2} x^{N-2} + cdots + c_0 ] where (c_i > 0) and (N = 3 deg P). Choose (x = 10^e) for large (e) (say, (x > 10 max_i c_i)). The decimal representation of (P(F(10^e))) becomes a concatenation of: - Decimal representation of (c_N - 1), - Decimal representation of (10^e - c_{N-1}), - Decimal representation of (c_{N-2}) with leading zeros, - ..., and similarly for other coefficients. For example, suppose (P(F(x)) = 15x^3 - 7x^2 + 4x + 19) and (x = 1000). Then: [ P(F(1000)) = 14,993,004,019 ] The sum of the digits of this representation is: [ S(P(F(10^e))) = 9e + k ] for some constant (k) dependent on (P) and (F), but not on (e).  Using Claim 2, we know (9e + k) will eventually match a Fibonacci number for large enough (e), leading to a contradiction, unless (P) is constant. Thus, (P) must be constant.

Case 1: ( a > 1 ) 1. The inequality can be rewritten by isolating the logarithmic terms:    [    log_{a}left(x^{2}-x-2right) - log_{a}left(x-frac{2}{a}right) > 1    ] 2. Using the properties of logarithms, the difference of logarithms simplifies to:    [    log_{a}left(frac{x^{2}-x-2}{x - frac{2}{a}}right) > 1    ] 3. Exponentiating both sides with base (a), we get:    [    frac{x^{2}-x-2}{x - frac{2}{a}} > a    ] 4. For the logarithms to be defined and for the fraction to be positive, the following conditions must hold:    [    x^{2}-x-2 > 0 quad text{and} quad x - frac{2}{a} > 0    ] 5.

We need to show that (a_{2023} leq 100,000). 1. **Base Case:**    We start with (a_0 = 0) and select each subsequent (a_n) to avoid forming any triplets with the previous terms. By definition, ((a_0, a_i, a_j)) cannot form an arithmetic triple where (2a_i = a_0 + a_j). 2. **Notation and Sequence Representation:**    Introduce notation (b(n)) to represent the ternary representation of the number (a_n). E.g., (b(13)_3 = 1101_3 = 1 + 9 + 27 = 37). 3. **Inductive Hypothesis:**    Assume that for any (q < n), the ternary representation of (a_i) matches with (b(i)). We need to show that (b(n)_3) does not form a triplet with any ternary representation (b(i)) for (i < n). 4. **Showing No Triplets Formed:**    Suppose there are numbers such that (2b(i)_3 = b(j)_3 + b(n)_3) (i.e., forms a triplet). When summing the numbers digit-wise in their ternary form, if the result is (2 cdot b(j)_3), then all positions in (b(i)) where there is a '1' must correspond to positions with '1' in both (b(j)) and (b(n)). However, this leads to (b(i) = b(j) = b(n)), contradicting the uniqueness of (n), hence no triplet is formed. 5. **Bounding the Sequence:**    To show (a_{2023} leq 100,000), consider the growth rate of the sequence in its base representation. Since (2023 < 2048 = 2^{11}), the ternary representation of (a_{2023}) will have at most 11 digits, each digit being either 0 or 1. 6. **Upper Threshold Calculation:**    The maximum number representable with 11 digits in ternary (using only 0s and 1s) is:    [    3^0 + 3^1 + cdots + 3^{10} = frac{3^{11} - 1}{2} = frac{177147 - 1}{2} = 88573    ]    Thus, (a_{2023} leq 88573 < 100,000). # Conclusion: [ boxed{a_{2023} leq 100,000} ]"},{"instruction":"Jane has 6 ounces of tea in a 10ounce mug and 6 ounces of milk in another mug of the same size.

Step 2: Stir Mug 2 and pour one-fourth back to Mug 1 - Total liquid in Mug 2 before pouring back = 8 ounces. - Amount of liquid transferred back to Mug 1 = frac{8}{4} = 2 ounces. Since the liquid in Mug 2 is a mixture of tea and milk in the ratio of 2 ounces of tea to 6 ounces of milk, the mixture is frac{2}{8} tea and frac{6}{8} milk.

We use the Euclidean algorithm to simplify this expression: 1. We first express gcd(n^3+100,n+10) in terms of n:    [    gcd(n^3+100,n+10) = gcd(-10n^2+100,n+10)    ]    This step follows from the property that if a mid b, then a mid (b+ka) for any integer k.

We then further simplify the expression:    [    gcd(-10n^2+100,n+10) = gcd(100n+100,n+10)    ]    This is achieved by subtracting -10n(n+10) from -10n^2+100. 3.

To find the greatest integer n for which this is true, we consider the largest divisor of 900 that is in the form of n+10. Since 900 itself is the largest divisor of 900, the largest value of n+10 that divides 900 is 900 itself. Therefore, the largest value of n is 900 - 10 = 890. To verify, we check that 890^3 + 100 is indeed divisible by 890 + 10 = 900. This confirms our solution.

Given that 167 is a prime, Euler's totient function yields (phi(167) = 166). The order of any (a_i) (where (a_i neq 1)) must therefore be a divisor of 166, which is 2 or 83 or their multiples. 7.

We will show that for any integer n > 4, there exists an n-vertex convex polyhedron where the product of the numbers assigned to the endpoints of the edges incident to any vertex is consistently -1.  Case 1: n is even 1. Let n be an even integer. Consider a pyramid whose base is a regular (n-1)-gon with n-1 geq 2 sides. 2. Assign the number -1 to every vertex of the pyramid. 3. The pyramid has one vertex at the apex and n-1 vertices around the base. 4. For any vertex in the base, three edges are incident to it. The product of the numbers at the other endpoints of these edges is (-1) cdot (-1) cdot (-1) = -1. 5. For the apex vertex, it has n-1 incident edges, and each edge's other endpoint is a base vertex with a number -1. 6. Thus, the product for the apex vertex is (-1)^{n-1}.

One of the edges connects to vertex B (with value +1), and the other three edges connect to vertices with value -1. 6. The product for any base vertex is (-1) cdot (-1) cdot (-1) cdot (+1) = -1. 7. For the apex A and B: A has (n-2) incident edges connecting to base vertices with value -1, hence, the product for A is (-1)^{n-2} = -1 since n-2 is odd. 8. Similarly, the product for apex B is also (-1)^{n-2} = -1. Therefore, we have shown that it is possible to construct a convex polyhedron with any integer n > 4 where the product of the numbers at the endpoints of the edges incident to any vertex is always -1.

To weigh an object of 3 grams on a balance scale, what is the minimum number of these weights required? And prove your conclusion.","output":"**Solution**: According to the problem, weights of the same mass will not appear on both pans of the balance scale at the same time. Assume that when the balance scale is balanced, |x| weights of 9 grams are used. When this weight appears on the same pan as the object being weighed, x takes a negative integer. Similarly, assume |y| weights of 13 grams are used. Therefore, when the balance scale is balanced and the 3-gram object is weighed, we have: 9x + 13y = 3, The problem becomes finding the minimum value of |x| + |y|. First, we can arbitrarily choose an integer solution for the equation. Since y = frac{3 - 9x}{13}, when x = 9, we get y = -6. Using this solution, we have: 9 times 9 - 13 times 6 = 3 9x + 13y = 3 Subtracting the two equations, we get 9(x - 9) + 13(y + 6) = 0 9(x - 9) = -13(y + 6), Since 9 and 13 are coprime, x - 9 must be divisible by 13. Therefore, let x - 9 = 13k, where k is an integer. Then we have 9 times 13k = -13(y + 6), and -(y + 6) = 9k. In summary, we have: x = 9 + 13k y = -6 - 9k where k = 0, pm1, pm2. 1.

We denote the four random points as (P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4). 2. **Defining the quadruple**: For a tetrahedron (P_1P_2P_3P_4), we can define a quadruple ((epsilon_{(ijk)})), where ((ijk)) ranges over all conjugates of the cycle ((123)) in the alternating group (A_4). Here, (epsilon_{ijk}) is the sign of the directed volume ([O P_i P_j P_k]). This sign depends on the position of each point relative to the origin. 3. **Assumption**: We assume that for a given tetrahedron (P_1P_2P_3P_4), all members of its quadruple are nonzero. This assumption holds with probability 1 because the points are chosen randomly and independently. 4. **Reflection through the origin**: For (1 leq i leq 4), if we replace (P_i) with its reflection through the origin, the signs of the directed volumes ([O P_i P_j P_k]) involving (P_i) will flip. This occurs because each ( [O P_i P_j P_k] ) is a linear function of the vector (overrightarrow{O P_i}). 5. **Generating sister tetrahedra**: By independently choosing whether to reflect each (P_i) through the origin, we generate 16 sister tetrahedra. The quadruples ((epsilon_{(ijk)})) will range through all 16 possible combinations of (pm 1). 6. **Identifying tetrahedra containing the origin**: Only 2 of the 16 tetrahedra will have quadruples ((1,1,1,1)) and ((-1,-1,-1,-1)).

The formula for simple interest (SI) is: SI = P * r * t / 100 where r is the rate of interest per annum and t is the time in years. Given that the simple interest is Rs. 56 at 5% per annum, we can write: 56 = P * 5 * n / 100 56 = P * n / 20 P * n = 56 * 20 P * n = 1120  ...(1) The formula for compound interest (CI) for n years is: CI = P * [(1 + r/100)^n - 1] where r is the rate of interest per annum. Given that the compound interest is Rs. 57.40 at 5% per annum, we can write: 57.40 = P * [(1 + 5/100)^n - 1] 57.40 = P * [(1.05)^n - 1] P * [(1.05)^n - 1] = 57.40  ...(2) Now, we know that the difference between compound interest and simple interest for 2 years on the same sum at the same rate is given by: Difference = P * r^2 / (100^2) In this case, the difference is Rs. 57.40 - Rs. 56 = Rs. 1.40, and r = 5, so: 1.40 = P * 5^2 / (100^2) 1.40 = P * 25 / 10000 P * 25 = 1.40 * 10000 P * 25 = 14000 P = 14000 / 25 P = 560  ...(3) Now we have the value of P, we can substitute it back into equation (1) to find n: P * n = 1120 560 * n = 1120 n = 1120 / 560 n = 2 Therefore, the interest was calculated for boxed{2}  years."},{"instruction":"Prove that for any natural number ( n ), the sequence given by a_{n} = sum_{k=0}^{n} 2^{3k} binom{2n+1}{2k+1} is not divisible by 5.","output":"We are given the sum  [ a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 2^{3k} binom{2n+1}{2k+1} ] and we need to prove that (a_n) is not divisible by 5 for any natural number (n). 1. To analyze this sum, first define  [ b_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 2^{3k} binom{2n+1}{2k}. ] 2. Consider the following two sums involving (a_n) and (b_n):     [     sqrt{8} a_n + b_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{2n+1}{2k+1} (sqrt{8})^{2k+1} + sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{2n+1}{2k} (sqrt{8})^{2k}.     ] 3.

By adding and subtracting these two equations:     [     (sqrt{8} a_n + b_n)(sqrt{8} a_n - b_n) = ((sqrt{8} + 1)^{2n+1})((sqrt{8} - 1)^{2n+1}).     ] 7. Noting that:     [     (sqrt{8} + 1)(sqrt{8} - 1) = 8 - 1 = 7,     ] we have:     [     (sqrt{8} a_n + b_n)(sqrt{8} a_n - b_n) = 7^{2n+1}.     ] 8.

We prove the following lemma: *Lemma:* If the two piles have sizes ( n ) and ( m ) such that ( v(n) = v(m) ), after the first player's move, the exponents of the two piles will be different. *Proof:* Suppose ( v(n) = v(m) ). Let the first player remove ( r ) matches from one of the piles (say the pile with ( n ) matches) such that ( r mid m ). Then: [ v(r) le v(m) = v(n). ] If ( v(r) < v(n) ), then: [ v(n - r) < v(n) = v(m), ] so the exponents of the two piles will be different. Otherwise, if ( v(r) = v(n) ), then ( n = 2^k n_1 ) and ( r = 2^k r_1 ) with ( n_1 ) and ( r_1 ) being odd.

We can factor ( f(x) ) into irreducible polynomials over the reals. Each irreducible factor will be either a linear polynomial with a negative root or a quadratic polynomial with complex conjugate roots. 3. **Considering the Quadratic Factors:**    Let us consider a quadratic factor of ( f(x) ) of the form ( x^2 + bx + c ) where ( b ) and ( c ) are real numbers.

Since p = 2, the Cartesian equation of curve C<sub>2</sub> becomes y^2 = 4x.

In Squareland, stamps can be combined freely without additional regulations. Prove that for any positive integer ( n ), there are the same number of ways to correctly stamp a letter with a total value of ( n ) cents in both countries. The arrangement of the same stamps on a letter does not create a difference.","output":"1. **Representation of Franking in Squareland**:    Assume we have a valid franking in Squareland with a_1 stamps of value 1 cent, a_2 stamps of value 4 cents, and so on, up to a_M stamps of value M^2 cents. The total value of these stamps is n cents, which can be represented as:    [    n = sum_{k=1}^{M} k^2 a_k    ] 2. **Transformation to Odd Numbers**:    Each square number k^2 can be expressed as a sum of consecutive odd numbers:    [    k^2 = sum_{j=1}^k (2j-1)    ]    By substituting this into our initial equation and interchanging the order of summation, we get:    [    n = sum_{k=1}^{M} sum_{j=1}^{k}(2j-1)a_k = sum_{j=1}^{M} (2j-1) sum_{k=j}^{M} a_k    ] 3. **Obtaining Oddland Franking**:    Let us define b_j = sum_{k=j}^{M} a_k. Using this transformation, the equation becomes:    [    n = sum_{j=1}^{M} (2j-1) b_j    ]    This can be interpreted as b_1 stamps of value 1 cent, b_2 stamps of value 3 cents, and so on up to b_M stamps of value 2M-1 cents. 4. **Validity of Oddland Franking**:    We need to verify that the number of lower denomination stamps is at least as large as the number of higher denomination stamps. By our definition of b_j:    [    b_j = sum_{k=j}^{M} a_k    ]    This implies that b_j geq b_{j+1} for 1 leq j < M. Specifically:    [    b_j - b_{j+1} = a_j geq 0    ]    Hence, the franking satisfies Oddland's requirement that for every two different denominations, the quantity of the lower denomination must be at least that of the higher. 5. **Reverse Transformation**:    Suppose we have a valid franking from Oddland with sums denoted as b_1, b_2, ldots, b_M. We can convert this back to Squareland by setting:    [    a_1 = b_1 - b_2, ; a_2 = b_2 - b_3, ; ldots, ; a_{M-1} = b_{M-1} - b_M, ; a_M = b_M    ] 6. **Verification of Bijective Correspondence**:    The transformations between the franking in Oddland and Squareland are bijections. Each franking in Squareland can be uniquely transformed to a franking in Oddland, and vice versa.

Player B's obligate winning strategy:    In each round, Player B will always try to fill in the coefficients of the polynomial in such a way that maintains strategic control. 5. Understanding the number of rounds:    After (n-2) rounds, there will be at a minimum one odd-degree term coefficient remaining unfilled and at least two even-degree term coefficients remaining unfilled. 6. Construct strategic argument:    Suppose after (2n-3) moves, we can express the polynomial in the form:    [     P(x) = g(x) + square x^s + square x^t     ]    Here, (g(x)) is a polynomial whose coefficients are already determined, (t) is an odd number, and (s neq t). 7. Player B fills in the coefficient for (x^s):    Player B can strategically place:    [     a = -frac{frac{1}{2^t} g(2) + g(-1)}{2^{s-t} + (-1)^s}     ]    Ensuring ( 2^{s-t} + (-1)^s neq 0 ), the coefficient ( a ) exists. 8. Final filling step:    No matter how Player A fills the coefficient of ( x^t ):    [     b text{ is the coefficient that Player A fills next.}    ]    We analyze:    [     begin{aligned}    & frac{1}{2^t} f(2) + f(-1)     = & frac{1}{2^t} left(g(2) + a cdot 2^s + b cdot 2^t right) + left(g(-1) + a cdot (-1)^s + b cdot (-1)^t right)     = & left( frac{1}{2^t} g(2) + g(-1) right) + a cdot left(2^{s-t} + (-1)^s right)     = & 0    end{aligned}    ]    Therefore, ( f(2) ) and ( f(-1) ) are either both zero or have opposite signs. 9. Analyzing root conditions:    If ( f(2) = 0 ) or ( f(-1) = 0 ), or they have opposite signs, the polynomial ( f(x) ) has real roots since it must cross the x-axis between -1 and 2. Conclusion: By ensuring the polynomial has real roots or ascertaining the intermediate value theorem, Player B has a winning strategy irrespective of the sequence of Player A’s moves. Hence, (boxed{text{Player B wins}})"},{"instruction":"Drawing a pie to satisfy hunger is a ______ event.","output":"To solve the problem, we analyze the event described: 1.

For each match, points are awarded as follows: 3 points for a win, 1 point to each team in a draw, and 0 points for a loss. 4. Therefore, the total sum of points from all matches will be determined by the total number of points awarded in victories and draws combined. In case all matches are won by someone, the total points would be 10 times 3 = 30 points. 5. According to the problem:    - Team A scored the most points despite losing to team B.    - Teams B and C did not lose any match.    - Team C scored fewer points than team D. 6. Since B and C did not lose any match, they must either win or draw each match. Hence, (c geq 4) because team C should at least draw all its matches. 7. Team B must have outperformed team C by winning against team A and not losing any match. Therefore, (b geq 6). Now, let’s examine the possibilities: 1. Team C does not lose any match but it scores fewer points than team D. Therefore, we can conclude (d > c ). 2. Team A scores the highest points but loses to B and draws with C. Thus, team A scores less than 9 points (fewer than 3 victories and a draw or equivalent). Given the above constraints and the sum of points not exceeding maximum points (30), the solutions should distribute the points uniquely, ensuring: [a neq b neq c neq d neq e] Assuming: 1. A has scored exactly 7 points. Then B must have drawn A and won remaining matches. 2. B scores exactly 6 points through 3 wins and remaining draws. 3. Since C has no loss, it scored 4 points through all draws. 4. For D to score more than C, choose d = 5. 5. Remaining points go to E, which scored 2 through draws. **Verifying the solution**: - Points sum to 7+6+4+5+2 = 24. - This includes 10-3 = 7 draws (2 points) and 6+4+3 wins (each 3 pts).

Let us consider a sphere with center O and radius R that touches the edges of a trirectangular corner (a three-sided angle with all flat angles equal to alpha) at points A, B, and C. Additionally, for the sphere to touch all sides, the sphere must intersect the plane faces of the trirectangular corner at circles of radius r. 2. First, we need to find the relationship between the side length a of the triangle formed by the points A, B, and C where each face angle is alpha. From trigonometry, we know that the length of the edge AB can be found using:    [    a = AB = 2r cos frac{alpha}{2}    ] 3. Now, consider a regular triangular pyramid PABC with the vertex P at the apex. Let PM be the height of this pyramid, and A, B, C are all on the base.

By the theorem of three perpendiculars (in rectangular space geometry), the distance from O to any of the sides will be perpendicular to the corresponding side lines. Therefore, the distance from O_1 to PA is r, and similarly for the other pertinent distances. 7.
