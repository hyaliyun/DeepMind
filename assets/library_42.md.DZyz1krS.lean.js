The diagonal divides the polygon into two smaller polygons. We need to determine the number of vertices in each of these smaller polygons. 3. **Condition for Odd Vertices:**    If (y - x) is even, then the number of vertices in each of the two resulting polygons will be odd. This is because the total number of vertices in the original polygon is even ((2n+2)), and splitting it into two parts with an even difference ensures both parts have an odd number of vertices. 4. **Counting Diagonals with Odd (y - x):**    We now count the number of diagonals such that (y - x) is odd. This will help us determine the number of diagonals that do not split the polygon into two polygons with odd vertices.    - For an odd (x), the possible values for (y) that make (y - x) odd are the even numbers greater than (x). For example, if (x = 1), then (y) can be (4, 6, 8, ldots, 2n). The number of such (y) values is (frac{n(n-1)}{2}).    - For an even (x), the possible values for (y) that make (y - x) odd are the odd numbers greater than (x). For example, if (x = 2), then (y) can be (5, 7, 9, ldots, 2n+1). The number of such (y) values is also (frac{n(n-1)}{2}). 5. **Total Diagonals with Odd (y - x):**    Summing these, the total number of diagonals where (y - x) is odd is:    [    frac{n(n-1)}{2} + frac{n(n-1)}{2} = n(n-1)    ] 6. **Total Diagonals:**    The total number of diagonals in the ((2n+2))-gon is given by:    [    frac{(2n+2)(2n+1)}{2} - (2n+2) = n(2n+1) - 1    ]    However, we are given that (n^2) diagonals are drawn. 7. **Conclusion:**    Since there are (n^2) diagonals drawn and (n(n-1)) of them do not split the polygon into two polygons with odd vertices, it follows that:    [    n^2 - n(n-1) = n    ]    Therefore, at least one of the (n^2) diagonals must split the polygon into two polygons, each with an odd number of vertices.

The four distances are:     - MA: the distance from M to A     - MB: the distance from M to B     - MC: the distance from M to C     - MD: the distance from M to D     According to the Pythagorean theorem, the distances can be expressed as:               MA^2 = x^2 + t^2               MB^2 = y^2 + x^2               MC^2 = y^2 + z^2               MD^2 = t^2 + z^2           3. **Sum of Squares of the Diagonals**:         We begin by summing the squares of two opposite corners. Start with MA^2 and MC^2:          MA^2 + MC^2 = (x^2 + t^2) + (y^2 + z^2)          Simplify the right-hand side:          MA^2 + MC^2 = x^2 + t^2 + y^2 + z^2           Now, sum the squares of the other two opposite corners, MB^2 and MD^2:          MB^2 + MD^2 = (y^2 + x^2) + (t^2 + z^2)          Simplify the right-hand side:          MB^2 + MD^2 = y^2 + x^2 + t^2 + z^2          Since both expressions for MA^2 + MC^2 and MB^2 + MD^2 simplify to x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + t^2, we have:          MA^2 + MC^2 = MB^2 + MD^2      4. **Conclusion**:      Thus, we have shown through using the Pythagorean theorem that the sum of the distances squared from any point in the plane to two opposite corners of a rectangle equals the sum of the distance squared from that point to the two other corners.

According to the given information, when the seller sells the apple for Rs. 19, he incurs a loss of ( frac{1}{6} ) of the cost price. This means that the selling price (SP) is ( frac{5}{6} ) of the cost price, because after losing ( frac{1}{6} ) of the cost price, the remaining amount is what the seller gets from the sale. So we can write the equation as: [ SP = frac{5}{6} times C ] We know the selling price (SP) is Rs. 19, so we can substitute that into the equation: [ 19 = frac{5}{6} times C ] Now, we can solve for ( C ) by multiplying both sides of the equation by ( frac{6}{5} ) to isolate ( C ): [ C = 19 times frac{6}{5} ] [ C = frac{19 times 6}{5} ] [ C = frac{114}{5} ] [ C = 22.8 ] Therefore, the cost price of the apple is Rs. boxed{22.8} ."},{"instruction":"Calculate using the knowledge you have learned:<br/> (1) Given a gt b, and a^{2}+b^{2}=13, ab=6, find the value of ab;<br/> (2) Given a, b, and c are the three sides of right triangle ABC, if a^{2}+b^{2}+25=6a+8b, find the perimeter of right triangle ABC.","output":"Let's break down the solution into detailed steps: # Problem 1: Calculate a-b Given: - a^2 + b^2 = 13 - ab = 6 - a > b We want to find a-b.

For at least three distinct points on the circle to have a distance of sqrt{2} from the line l: y = kx, the distance from the center of the circle to the line must be equal to or less than sqrt{2}.

Step 1: Base Case Let's first check the base case for ( n = 1 ): [ 1^3 + 5 times 1 = 1 + 5 = 6 ] Since 6 is divisible by 6, the base case holds true.  Step 2: Inductive Step Suppose the statement is true for some natural number ( k ), i.e., assume that ( k^3 + 5k ) is divisible by 6. Now, we need to show that the statement holds for ( k + 1 ). That is, we need to show that ( (k+1)^3 + 5(k+1) ) is divisible by 6.  Step 3: Expand and Simplify First, expand ( (k + 1)^3 ): [ (k+1)^3 = k^3 + 3k^2 + 3k + 1 ] So, [ (k+1)^3 + 5(k+1) = (k^3 + 3k^2 + 3k + 1) + 5(k + 1) ] Combine like terms: [ (k+1)^3 + 5(k+1) = k^3 + 3k^2 + 3k + 1 + 5k + 5 = k^3 + 5k + 3k^2 + 3k + 6 ]  Step 4: Use Inductive Hypothesis Recall our assumption that ( k^3 + 5k ) is divisible by 6. We can rewrite the expression as: [ k^3 + 5k + 3k^2 + 3k + 6 = (k^3 + 5k) + 3k^2 + 3k + 6 ] Since ( k^3 + 5k ) is divisible by 6 by our inductive hypothesis, we only need to check if ( 3k^2 + 3k + 6 ) is divisible by 6.  Step 5: Simplify Further Factor out the common term in ( 3k^2 + 3k + 6 ): [ 3k^2 + 3k + 6 = 3(k^2 + k + 2) ] Notice ( k^2 + k ) is always even (since ( k(k+1) ) is the product of two consecutive integers, one of which is always even), and hence ( k^2 + k + 2 ) is always even. Since ( 3 times text{even number} ) is divisible by 6, we conclude that: [ 3(k^2 + k + 2) ] is divisible by 6. Therefore, ( (k+1)^3 + 5(k+1) ) is the sum of two terms both divisible by 6: [ (k^3 + 5k) + 3k(k + 1) + 6 ] This means ( (k+1)^3 + 5(k+1) ) is divisible by 6.  Conclusion By mathematical induction, we have shown that ( n^3 + 5n ) is divisible by 6 for all natural numbers ( n ).

We are asked to conclude that  lim_{n to infty} xi_n  does not exist almost surely (with probability 1). Here is the detailed step-by-step solution: 1. **Identifying the Event Probabilities:**    The probability of the event ( A_n ), which is xi_n being 0, is:    [    mathrm{P}(A_n) = mathrm{P}(xi_n = 0) = frac{1}{n}.    ]        Similarly, the probability of the complement event ( bar{A}_n ), which is xi_n being 1, is:    [    mathrm{P}(bar{A}_n) = mathrm{P}(xi_n = 1) = 1 - frac{1}{n}.    ] 2. **Series Sum of the Probabilities:**    We need to examine the series sum of the probabilities:    [    sum_{n=1}^{infty} mathrm{P}(A_n) = sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{1}{n}.    ]        The harmonic series sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{1}{n} diverges, which means:    [    sum_{n=1}^{infty} mathrm{P}(A_n) = infty.    ]        Similarly, we consider the series of the complements:    [    sum_{n=1}^{infty} mathrm{P}(bar{A}_n) = sum_{n=1}^{infty} left(1 - frac{1}{n}right).    ]        Notice that:    [    sum_{n=1}^{infty} left(1 - frac{1}{n}right) = sum_{n=1}^{infty} 1 - sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{1}{n} = infty - infty,    ]    but since the second term is subtracted from an infinity of 1's (trivially large infinity), it also results in an infinite series:    [    sum_{n=1}^{infty} mathrm{P}(bar{A}_n) = infty.    ] 3. **Applying the Borel-Cantelli Lemma:**    By the Borel-Cantelli Lemma, we have the following results based on our series sums:    - If the series sum sum_{n=1}^{infty} mathrm{P}(A_n) = infty, then the event A_n occurs infinitely often almost surely.    - Similarly, if sum_{n=1}^{infty} mathrm{P}(bar{A}_n) = infty, then the event bar{A}_n occurs infinitely often almost surely. 4. **Conclusion:**    Since both sum_{n=1}^{infty} mathrm{P}(A_n) = infty and sum_{n=1}^{infty} mathrm{P}(bar{A}_n) = infty, it follows from the Borel-Cantelli Lemma that:    - The event xi_n = 0 (i.e., A_n) will occur infinitely often almost surely.    - The event xi_n = 1 (i.e., bar{A}_n) will also occur infinitely often almost surely.    Therefore, the sequence {xi_n} does not converge almost surely, because it will infinitely often switch between 0 and 1.

We need to show that we can select ( 2m ) vertices such that every vertex has at least one selected neighbor. 2. **Base Case:**    For ( m = 1 ), the graph has ( 3 cdot 1 + 1 = 4 ) vertices. We need to select ( 2 cdot 1 = 2 ) vertices. In any connected graph of 4 vertices, we can always find 2 vertices such that every vertex is adjacent to at least one of these 2 vertices. This is straightforward and serves as our base case. 3. **Inductive Step:**    Assume the statement is true for ( m = t ). That is, for a graph with ( 3t + 1 ) vertices, we can select ( 2t ) vertices such that every vertex has at least one selected neighbor. We need to prove it for ( m = t + 1 ). 4. **Graph Reduction to a Spanning Tree:**    If there is a cycle in the graph, we can remove an edge from the cycle without losing connectivity. Repeating this process, we eventually reduce the graph to a spanning tree. 5. **Consider the Spanning Tree:**    Let the root of the spanning tree be ( V ). If the length of the path from the farthest leaf ( L ) to ( V ) is at least 3, let the path be ( V, P_1, P_2, ldots, P_k, L ) where ( k geq 2 ). 6. **Select Vertices on the Path:**    Select the vertices ( P_k ) and ( P_{k-1} ). These vertices cover ( L ), ( P_k ), and ( P_{k-1} ). Removing these three vertices, the remaining graph is still connected because ( P_{k-1} neq V ). 7. **Apply Induction Hypothesis:**    By the induction hypothesis, we can select ( 2t ) vertices from the remaining graph to cover all other vertices. Combining these with our two selected vertices, we have ( 2t + 2 = 2(t + 1) ) vertices, satisfying the condition. 8. **Short Paths in the Spanning Tree:**    If the length of the path from any leaf to ( V ) is less than 3, we can name the vertices ( O_1, O_2, ldots, O_a, T_1, T_2, ldots, T_b, Q_1, Q_2, ldots, Q_b ) such that all edges are ( VO_1, VO_2, ldots, VO_a, VT_1, VT_2, ldots, VT_b, T_1Q_1, T_2Q_2, ldots, T_bQ_b ). 9. **Select Vertices in Short Paths:**    Select ( V, T_1, T_2, ldots, T_b ). This selection covers all vertices. The number of selected vertices is ( b + 1 ). Since ( a + 2b = 3(t + 1) ), we have ( b + 1 leq frac{3(t + 1) + 2}{2} = frac{3t + 5}{2} leq 2(t + 1) ). 10. **Conclusion:**     We have shown that in both cases, we can select at most ( 2(t + 1) ) vertices, completing the induction.

The largest perfect cube m^3 leq 200 is when m=5 (since 5^3 = 125 and 6^3 = 216), giving us 5 perfect cubes.  **Step 3:** Count the higher powers within the given range: - Perfect fifth powers: 2^5 = 32 and 3^5 = 243 (last is out of the range, so only 2^5 counts). - Perfect sixth powers: 2^6=64. - Other powers such as 2^7=128, and 2^8=256 (last is out of the range). - All higher powers of other bases exceed 200. **Step 4:** Account for overlaps.  - 1 is repeated among all power counts. - 64 is counted both as 8^2 (a perfect square) and 2^6 (a perfect sixth power). Thus, the unique perfect powers are: 14 (squares) + 5 (cubes) + 1 (fifth power) + 1 (sixth power) + 1 (seventh power) - 2 (repetitions) = 20 unique perfect powers. **Step 5:** Calculate non-perfect powers and the total probability.

Suppose the statement is false. Therefore, in any group of 12 people, we cannot find the required pair and five individuals satisfying the given condition. 2.

We will count the number N of triplets {A, B, C_i} in two different ways. 4. First, consider all possible pairs {A, B}. For a group of 12 people, there are a total of frac{12 cdot 11}{2} = 66 pairs. 5. Each pair {A, B} must be associated with at least six people C_i such that each C_i knows exactly one person in {A, B}. Therefore, the total number of such triplets is:    [    N geq 6 cdot 66 = 396    ] 6. Next, fix any individual C_i. For each C_i, we find pairs {A, B} where C_i is friends with exactly one person in {A, B}. If C_i has n friends, then the number of such pairs is n(11-n).         Since n(11 - n) is maximized when n = frac{11}{2} = 5.5, and we find that n(11 - n) leq 30, the number of pairs is maximized at 30. 7.

The inequality 396 leq 360 leads to a contradiction. # Conclusion: Hence, the initial assumption is false.

Let’s proceed step-by-step. 1. **Define the Problem Parameters:**    Let’s consider a convex quadrilateral (ABCD). We are given:    - The area of the quadrilateral (ABCD) is equal to the product of its median lines.    - The median lines are the segments connecting the midpoints of opposite sides.     2. **Median Lines:**    Name the midpoints of (AB), (BC), (CD), and (DA) as (M), (N), (O), and (P), respectively. The median lines are the segments (MP) and (NO). 3. **Property of Median Lines in Quadrilaterals:**    For a convex quadrilateral, the median lines (MP) and (NO) form a parallelogram since diagonals of a quadrilateral and its median lines intersect at their midpoints. 4. **Area Relationship:**    The area of the parallelogram formed by the median lines is given by:    [    text{Area of parallelogram} = text{Length of } MP times text{Length of } NO    ]        According to the problem, this area is also equal to the area of the quadrilateral (ABCD). Thus:    [    text{Area of } ABCD = MP times NO    ] 5. **Diagonal Relation:**    For a quadrilateral, the area can be calculated using its diagonals if the diagonals intersect at an angle (theta). The area (A) of quadrilateral (ABCD) is:    [    A = frac{1}{2} times d_1 times d_2 times sin theta    ]    where (d_1) and (d_2) are the lengths of the diagonals of the quadrilateral. 6. **Equating Areas:**    Since the area can be represented in terms of diagonals and also as the product of median lines:    [    frac{1}{2} times d_1 times d_2 times sin theta = MP times NO    ]        Since ( sin theta leq 1 ), the equality holds true only when the diagonals (d_1) and (d_2) are equal and (theta = 90^circ). Therefore:    [    d_1 = d_2    ] 7. **Conclusion:**    If the area of the convex quadrilateral is equal to the product of its median lines, then it must have equal diagonals. Therefore, we have shown that if the given condition about the area and median lines holds, the diagonals of the quadrilateral are indeed equal.

This leads to the equation f(x) cdot f(1) = f(x) > 1. This implies that f(1) must equal 1 to satisfy the equation since f(x) > 1 for x > 1. Therefore, we conclude that f(1) = 1, making Conclusion ① correct. **For Conclusion ④:** When x < 1, we set x = t and choose y = 2 - t > 1. This gives us the equation f(t) cdot f(2 - t) = f(1) = 1. Since f(2-t) > 1 for 2-t > 1, it follows that f(t) = frac{1}{f(2-t)} must be in the interval (0, 1) for the equation to hold. Therefore, when x < 1, 0 < f(x) < 1, making Conclusion ④ correct. **For Conclusion ③:** Given that f(x) > 0 for all x in mathbb{R}, we take any x_1, x_2 in mathbb{R} with x_1 < x_2. Setting x = x_1 and x + y - 1 = x_2, we find y = x_2 - x_1 + 1 > 1. This leads to the equation f(x_1) cdot f(x_2 - x_1 + 1) = f(x_2). Since f(x_2 - x_1 + 1) > 1, it follows that f(x_2) / f(x_1) > 1, implying f(x_1) < f(x_2). Thus, f(x) is monotonically increasing on mathbb{R}, making Conclusion ③ correct. **For Conclusion ②:** Choosing x = 0 and y = 2, we get f(0) cdot f(2) = f(1) = 1. Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we find that f(0) + f(2) > 2sqrt{f(0) cdot f(2)} = 2.

Since we are arranging all 5 cars, we have n = r = 5, so the total number of arrangements is: [ {A}_{5}^{5} = frac{5!}{(5-5)!} = frac{5!}{0!} = 5! = 120 ] **Step 2: Calculate the number of arrangements where A and B are not consecutive.** First, we arrange the other 3 types of cars (C, D, and E), which can be done in {A}_{3}^{3} = 3! = 6 ways.

We need to determine if there exists a set ( S ) of 5783 different real numbers such that for every ( a, b in S ) (not necessarily distinct), there exist ( c neq d ) in ( S ) such that ( a cdot b = c + d ). 2. Consider the set ( S = {0, pm 1, pm x, pm x^2, ldots, pm x^{2890}} ) where ( x ) is a real number satisfying ( x^{2891} = x + 1 ) and ( x in (1, 2) ). 3. First, we verify that the set ( S ) contains 5783 different real numbers. The set ( S ) includes:    - ( 0 )    - ( pm 1 )    - ( pm x, pm x^2, ldots, pm x^{2890} )    This gives us ( 1 + 2 times 2891 = 1 + 5782 = 5783 ) different real numbers. 4. Next, we need to show that for every ( a, b in S ), there exist ( c neq d ) in ( S ) such that ( a cdot b = c + d ). 5. Consider the equation ( x^{2891} = x + 1 ). This implies that ( x^{2891} - x - 1 = 0 ). Since ( x in (1, 2) ), ( x ) is a real number. 6. For any ( a, b in S ), we can write ( a = pm x^m ) and ( b = pm x^n ) for some integers ( m, n ) in the range ( 0 leq m, n leq 2890 ). 7. We need to find ( c neq d ) in ( S ) such that ( a cdot b = c + d ). Consider the product ( a cdot b = (pm x^m) cdot (pm x^n) = pm x^{m+n} ). 8. Since ( x^{2891} = x + 1 ), we can express ( x^{m+n} ) in terms of ( x ) and 1. For example, if ( m+n leq 2890 ), then ( x^{m+n} ) is directly in ( S ). If ( m+n > 2890 ), we can use the relation ( x^{2891} = x + 1 ) to reduce the exponent modulo 2891. 9. Therefore, for any ( a cdot b = pm x^{m+n} ), we can find ( c = x^i ) and ( d = x^j ) such that ( c + d = x^i + x^j = x^{m+n} ) or ( -x^{m+n} ), ensuring ( c neq d ). 10.

The total length of the rope, which is 18 cm, is equal to the sum of the lengths of the three sides of the triangle.

There are 3 rows, and each row has 3 positions: left, middle, and right.    - If Celery sits on the left or right (2 out of 3 positions), Drum can sit next to her in 1 out of 2 remaining positions in that row.    - If Celery sits in the middle (1 out of 3 positions), Drum can sit next to her in 2 out of 2 remaining positions in that row. 3. **Calculate the probability for each case:**    - **Case 1: Celery sits on the sides (left or right).**      - Probability that Celery sits on the sides: (frac{2}{3}).      - Given Celery is on the side, the probability that Drum sits next to her: (frac{1}{2}).      - Combined probability for this case: (frac{2}{3} times frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{3}).    - **Case 2: Celery sits in the middle.**      - Probability that Celery sits in the middle: (frac{1}{3}).      - Given Celery is in the middle, the probability that Drum sits next to her: (frac{2}{2} = 1).      - Combined probability for this case: (frac{1}{3} times 1 = frac{1}{3}). 4. **Sum the probabilities of both cases:**    [    frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{3} = frac{2}{3}    ] 5. **Adjust for the fact that there are 3 rows:**    - The probability that Celery and Drum sit next to each other in any one row is (frac{2}{3}).    - Since there are 3 rows, the probability that they sit next to each other in any row is:      [      frac{2}{3} times frac{1}{3} = frac{2}{9}      ] 6. **Simplify the fraction (frac{2}{9}) to find (m) and (n):**    - Here, (m = 2) and (n = 9). 7. **Calculate (100m + n):**    [    100m + n = 100 times 2 + 9 = 200 + 9 = 209    ] The final answer is (boxed{209})."},{"instruction":"A chemical plant needs to study the correlation between the recovery rate of its products (y) and the content of effective components in the raw materials (x) to predict the recovery rate of its products.

Step 1: Position of Tug-of-War - Since tug-of-war must be the last event, its position is fixed. This leaves us with 4 events (kicking shuttlecocks, jumping rope, pushing the train, and multi-legged race) to arrange in the first 4 positions. Step 2: Position of Multi-Legged Race - The multi-legged race cannot be the first event. Therefore, it can be placed in any of the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th positions (since the 5th is occupied by tug-of-war). This gives us 3 options for placing the multi-legged race.

The number of ways to arrange 3 events in 3 positions is given by the permutation formula A_{3}^{3} = 3! = 6.

Note that the first sum, up to m=n+1, is equivalent to summing up to m=n since binom{n}{m} = 0 for m > n; the second sum can be re-indexed by letting k = m-1: [ S(n+1) = sum_{m=0}^{n} (-1)^m binom{n}{m} + 0 + sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^{k+1} binom{n}{k} ] 7.

Since the width of Jordan's rectangle is 15 inches, we can set up the following equation to find L: Area of Jordan's rectangle = Length × Width 120 square inches = L × 15 inches To find L, we divide both sides of the equation by 15 inches: L = 120 square inches / 15 inches L = 8 inches Therefore, the length of Jordan's rectangle is boxed{8}  inches."},{"instruction":"Given a = 3^{0.4}, b = log_{4}{0.3}, and c = log_{4}{3}, determine the proper relationship between them.","output":"First, evaluate each term individually: - Consider a = 3^{0.4}; since 3^{0.4} is greater than 3^0=1, we have a > 1. - Consider b = log_{4}{0.3}; because 0.3 is less than 1, and log_{4}{1} = 0, then b < 0. - Finally, consider c = log_{4}{3}; since 3 is less than 4 and log_{4}{4} = 1, we determine that 0 < c < 1.

We aim to find the values of (a) and (b) that minimize (M(a,b)). 2. To find a lower bound for (M(a,b)), we use the fact that the maximum of two numbers is at least as large as their average:    [    M(a,b) geq frac{3a^2 + 2b + 3b^2 + 2a}{2}    ] 3.

The coordinates of this point are (cos theta, sin theta). The unit circle helps in understanding the relationship between sine and cosine for any given angle. 2. **Sine and its Angles:**    Given a positive value of sine, say sin alpha = k (0 < k leq 1), there are two possible angles within the first 360 degrees (or 2pi radians) where this value of sine can occur:    - One in the first quadrant where alpha is the reference angle itself.    - Another in the second quadrant which can be represented by 180^circ - alpha or pi - alpha radians. 3. **Cosine Values for These Angles:**    For the angle alpha in the first quadrant, the cosine value is cos alpha.    - text{Cosine of } alpha: cos alpha    For the angle 180^circ - alpha (or pi - alpha radians) in the second quadrant:    - text{Cosine of } 180^circ - alpha: cos(180^circ - alpha) text{ or } cos(pi - alpha) 4. **Cosine Function Symmetry:**    Using the properties of the trigonometric functions, we know:    - cos(180^circ - alpha) = -cos alpha (because cosine is negative in the second quadrant)    So, for sin alpha = k:    - The corresponding values of cosine are cos alpha and -cos alpha. 5. **Graphical Interpretation:**    By mentally visualizing the unit circle:    - At angle alpha in the first quadrant, a right triangle formed would have k as the opposite side and cos alpha as the adjacent side of the reference angle alpha.    - At angle 180^circ - alpha in the second quadrant, the reference angle alpha remains same but the adjacent side (cosine) is now the negative of its first quadrant value, -cos alpha. 6. **Conclusion:**    Hence, for a given sine value, the cosine values are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign because they lie in different quadrants where cosine values are inherently positive or negative according to the unit circle's symmetry. This justifies why the cosine values corresponding to a given sine value are equal and opposite in sign. [ boxed{pm cos alpha} ]"},{"instruction":"Given a natural number M.

So, we assume ( M ) does not end with any zeros. 3. **Consider non-nine penultimate digit:**    We first consider the case where the penultimate digit of ( M ) is not a nine. Suppose the decimal representation of ( M ) has ( n ) digits. 4. **Forming a new number:**    We can always find a number that has ( n+1 ) digits and is divisible by ( M ), starting with the first digit ( b ).

This carry affects only one digit, as the penultimate digit of ( M ) is not nine. 7. **Sum of digits reduction:**    Therefore, the sum of digits of ( S + M cdot 10^n ) will be 9 less than the sum of the digits of ( S ) plus the sum of the digits of ( M cdot 10^n ). 8. **Conclusion in this case:**    Consequently, the sum of digits of ( S + M cdot 10^n ) is odd, leading to a contradiction. 9. **Consider nine as the penultimate digit:**    Now, consider the case where the penultimate digit of ( M ) is nine. We examine the sequence involving multiples of 3, such as ( 3M, 9M, 27M, ldots ). 10. **Observation on the sequence:**     By checking how the last two digits change upon multiplying by 3, it's not hard to see that among these numbers, there will be one whose penultimate digit is not a nine, and the last digit is not zero. 11. **Repeating previous argument:**     For this new number, the previous reasoning applies, leading to a contradiction once more. 12. **Final conclusion:**     Hence, it is not possible for all multiples of ( M ) to have even sums of digits.

Let the x-axis represent the value of the green point, and the y-axis represent the value of the purple point. The problem asks for the probability that the purple point's value is greater than the green point's value but less than twice the green point's value. This can be represented on the coordinate plane as follows: 1. Draw the coordinate axes from 0 to 1 for both the x and y axes, since the points are chosen from the interval between 0 and 1. 2. Identify the region where the value of the purple point (y) is greater than the value of the green point (x) but less than twice the value of the green point (2x). This region is bounded by the line y = x and the line y = 2x. 3. The intersection of these conditions on the coordinate plane creates a shaded region that represents all the possible outcomes that satisfy the problem's conditions. The shaded region can be divided into two triangles by drawing a line from the point (0.5, 1) to (0.5, 0.5). Each of these triangles has a base of frac{1}{2} and a height of frac{1}{2}. The area of a triangle is given by the formula frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height}, so the area of each triangle is frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{8}. Since there are two such triangles, the total shaded area is 2 times frac{1}{8} = frac{1}{4}. The total area of the square formed by the coordinate axes from 0 to 1 is 1 times 1 = 1. The probability that a randomly chosen point lies within the shaded region, which satisfies the problem's conditions, is the ratio of the shaded area to the total area of the square. Therefore, the probability is frac{text{shaded area}}{text{total area}} = frac{1}{4}.

First, let m = n = 0. We get: 2a_0 + 2a_0 = a_{0+0} + a_{0-0} Simplifying, we find: 4a_0 = 2a_0 implies a_0 = 0 Next, let m = n = 1. We have: 2a_1 + 2a_1 - 2 = a_2 + a_0 Using the given a_1 = 2, this becomes: 4a_1 - 2 = a_2 + a_0 implies a_2 = 8 - 0 = 8 Finally, let m = 2 and n = 1. We obtain: 2a_2 + 2a_1 - 2 = a_3 + a_1 Substituting a_1 = 2 and a_2 = 8, we have: 16 + 4 - 2 = a_3 + 2 implies a_3 = 18 Thus, the values are: a_0 = 0, quad a_2 = 8, quad a_3 = 18 **(II)** Again utilizing the given relationship, let's now set n = 1: 2a_m + 2a_1 - 2 = a_{m+1} + a_{m-1} Rearranging terms, we find: a_{m+1} - a_m = (a_m - a_{m-1}) + 2 This suggests that {a_{n+1} - a_n} is indeed an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2. **(III)** From the conclusion in part **(II)**, since {a_{n+1} - a_n} is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2 and we know that a_1 = 2, we can write: a_n = 2 + 4 + 6 + ldots + 2n = n(n + 1) Therefore, the sum of the reciprocals is given by: frac{1}{a_1} + frac{1}{a_2} + ldots + frac{1}{a_n} = frac{1}{1cdot2} + frac{1}{2cdot3} + ldots + frac{1}{n(n+1)} = 1 - frac{1}{n+1} For lambda to be always greater than 1 - frac{1}{n+1} for all n, we must have lambda geqslant 1.

Also, find the maximum area.","output":"**(1)** To find the arc length of the sector with alpha = 60^{circ} and r = 3, we first convert the angle to radians because the formula for arc length involves radians. We know that 180^{circ} is equivalent to pi radians, thus 60^{circ} is frac{60}{180}pi = frac{pi}{3} radians. The formula for the arc length l of a sector is given by l = |alpha|r, where alpha is the angle in radians and r is the radius. Substituting the given values: begin{align*} l &= frac{pi}{3} times 3  &= pi end{align*} Thus, the arc length of the sector is boxed{pi}. **(2)** Given that the perimeter of the sector is 16, and noting that the perimeter includes the arc length l and twice the radius, we can express this as l + 2r = 16. To find the angle alpha at which the area of the sector is maximized, we first express l in terms of r, l = 16 - 2r. The area of a sector S is given by frac{1}{2}lr, substituting l with 16 - 2r gives us: begin{align*} S &= frac{1}{2}(16 - 2r)r  &= -r^2 + 8r  &= -(r^2 - 8r + 16) + 16  &= -(r - 4)^2 + 16 end{align*} The expression -(r - 4)^2 + 16 reaches its maximum when the square term is minimized, i.e., (r - 4)^2 = 0 or when r = 4. The maximum area thus occurs when r = 4, and the maximum value of S is 16. To find the angle alpha at which this occurs, we need the length of the arc at this point. Substituting r = 4 into l = 16 - 2r gives l = 16 - 2(4) = 8. The angle in radians is found by dividing the arc length by the radius, alpha = frac{l}{r} = frac{8}{4} = 2 radians.

Using the original condition:    [    f(m) = f(n + (m-n)) geq f(n) + f(f(m-n)) - 1 geq f(n)    ]    This implies ( f(m) geq f(n) ), proving ( f ) is non-decreasing. 2. **Trivial Solution ( f equiv 1 ):**    The constant function ( f(n) = 1 ) for all ( n in mathbb{N} ) clearly satisfies the inequality:    [    f(m+n) = 1 geq 1 + 1 - 1 = 1    ] 3. **Finding Other Solutions:**    Assume ( f notequiv 1 ). Let ( a ) be the smallest positive integer such that ( f(a) > 1 ). Then for all ( b geq a ), ( f(b) geq f(a) > 1 ). 4. **Consider ( f(n) > n ) for some ( n ):**    Suppose ( f(n) > n ) for some ( n ). We have:    [    f(f(n)) = f((f(n) - n) + n) geq f(f(n) - n) + f(f(n)) - 1    ]    This implies:    [    f(f(n) - n) leq 1    ]    Hence, ( f(n) - n < a ). Denote the maximal value of ( f(n) - n ) by ( c ). Let ( f(k) = k + c ). Therefore, using monotonicity and the given condition:    [    2k + c geq f(2k) geq f(k) + f(f(k)) - 1     ]    Substituting ( f(k) = k + c ):    [    f(k) + f(k + c) - 1 = (k + c) + f(k + c) - 1    ]    Since ( f ) is non-decreasing and ( f(x + y) geq f(x) ):    [    f(k + c) geq k + c     ]    Hence:    [    (k + c) + (k + c) - 1 = 2k + 2c - 1    ]    Therefore:    [    2k + c geq 2k + 2c - 1    ]    This implies ( c leq 1 ) and thus ( f(n) leq n + 1 ) for all ( n ).    In particular, ( f(2007) leq 2008 ). 5. **Constructing Example Functions:**    We need to construct functions that demonstrate all possible values from 1 to 2008 for ( f(2007) ). Consider the following families of functions:    - For ( j = 1, 2, ldots, 2007 ):      [      f_j(n) = max {1, n + j - 2007}      ]      These functions ( f_j ) satisfy the condition and ( f_j(2007) = j ).    - For ( j = 2008 ):      [      f_{2008}(n) = begin{cases}      n & text{if } 2007 nmid n       n + 1 & text{if } 2007 mid n      end{cases}      ]      This function satisfies ( f_{2008}(2007) = 2008 ). 6. **Verification:**    Validate that these functions satisfy the original condition:    - For ( f_j ) with ( j leq 2007 ):      Note ( f_j ) is nondecreasing and ( f_j(n) leq n ). Hence,      [      f_j(m) + f_j(f_j(n)) - 1 leq (m + j - 2007) + (n + j - 2007) - 1 leq (m + n) + j - 2007 = f_j(m+n)      ]    - For ( f_{2008} ):      Verify:      [      n + 1 geq f_{2008}(n) geq n      ]      and conditions depend on the cases ( 2007 mid m + n ) and ( 2007 nmid m + n ).

The number of complaints increases by 1/3rd when they're short-staffed. So, the number of complaints when short-staffed is: 120 + (1/3 * 120) = 120 + 40 = 160 complaints per day when short-staffed. Now, we know that when the self-checkout is also broken, the store got a total of 576 complaints over 3 days. So, the average number of complaints per day when both conditions are true is: 576 complaints / 3 days = 192 complaints per day. Now, we need to find the percentage increase from when they're just short-staffed (160 complaints) to when the self-checkout is also broken (192 complaints). The increase in the number of complaints is: 192 complaints - 160 complaints = 32 complaints. To find the percentage increase, we divide the increase by the original number of complaints when short-staffed and multiply by 100: (32 complaints / 160 complaints) * 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20%.

The first 10 terms of the sequence ( {a_n} ) are: [ 1, 5, 4, 0, 5, 1, 0, 4, 5, 5. ] Since the units digit of ( (10+k)^2 ) is the same as the units digit of ( k^2 ), [ a_{11} text{ through } a_{20} text{ are these 10 terms increased by 5:} ] [ a_{21} = a_1 + 0, dots, a_{30} = a_{10} + 0. ] 13.

Thus, in this case, the common ratio q satisfies 0 < q < 1. Next, let's prove the sufficiency: Given a_1 < 0 and 0 < q < 1, It follows that a_n < 0, Therefore, frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = q < 1, which means a_{n+1} > a_n. Hence, {a_n} is an increasing sequence. In summary, the necessary and sufficient condition for {a_n} to be an increasing sequence is the common ratio q satisfying 0 < q < 1. Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{C}. To prove the necessity, given the first term is less than 0 and the sequence is increasing, we can deduce that the common ratio q is greater than 0. This leads to all terms of the sequence being less than 0. By simplifying frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} using the properties of a geometric sequence, we find its ratio to be q. Given that this ratio is less than 1, we conclude that the common ratio q is less than 1. To prove the sufficiency, given 0 < q < 1 and the first term is negative, we deduce that all terms of the sequence are negative. Simplifying frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} using the properties of a geometric sequence, we find its ratio to be q. Since q < 1, we conclude that a_{n+1} > a_n, meaning the sequence is increasing. In summary, the necessary and sufficient condition for {a_n} to be an increasing sequence is the common ratio q satisfying 0 < q < 1, leading to the correct option.

How many apples will he have left to eat raw?","output":"Let's start by calculating the number of wormy apples. Since 20% of the apples have worms, we can find this number by taking 20% of 120 apples: Number of wormy apples = 20% of 120                          = 0.20 * 120                          = 24 apples Next, let's calculate the number of moldy apples. Since 30% of the apples are moldy, we can find this number by taking 30% of 120 apples: Number of moldy apples = 30% of 120                        = 0.30 * 120                        = 36 apples Now, we know that the number of bruised apples is nine more than the number of wormy apples.

We need to find the probability that the red ball is tossed into a higher-numbered bin than the green ball.  Step-by-step Analysis: 1. **Symmetry Argument**:    - The problem is symmetric with respect to the red and green balls. Therefore, the probability that the red ball is tossed into a higher-numbered bin than the green ball is the same as the probability that the green ball is tossed into a higher-numbered bin than the red ball. 2. **Probability of Landing in the Same Bin**:    - The probability that both balls land in the same bin k is the product of their individual probabilities of landing in bin k, which is (2^{-k})(2^{-k}) = 2^{-2k}.    - Summing this over all k, we get the total probability of both balls landing in the same bin:      [      sum_{k=1}^{infty} 2^{-2k} = sum_{k=1}^{infty} (2^2)^{-k} = frac{1}{3}      ]      This uses the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series sum_{k=0}^{infty} ar^k = frac{a}{1-r}, where a = 2^{-2} and r = 2^{-2}. 3. **Probability of Different Bins**:    - Since the total probability must sum to 1, and the probability of both balls landing in the same bin is frac{1}{3}, the probability of them landing in different bins is 1 - frac{1}{3} = frac{2}{3}. 4. **Equal Probabilities for Red Higher and Green Higher**:    - By symmetry, the probabilities of the red ball landing in a higher-numbered bin than the green ball and the green ball landing in a higher-numbered bin than the red ball are equal. Therefore, each of these probabilities is half of frac{2}{3}, which is frac{1}{3}. Thus, the probability that the red ball is tossed into a higher-numbered bin than the green ball is boxed{frac{1}{3}}. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"On a circle, 2012 points are marked, dividing it into equal arcs. From these points, ( k ) points are selected, and a convex ( k )gon is constructed with its vertices at the chosen points. What is the largest possible value of ( k ) such that this polygon has no parallel sides?","output":"1. We are given a circle divided into 2012 equal parts by marking 2012 points on it. Let's denote these points as (A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{2012}). 2. We need to determine the maximum value of (k) such that if (k) points are selected and a convex (k)-gon is formed, it has no parallel sides. 3. Let's consider the points (A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{2012}) arranged sequentially around the circle in a clockwise or counterclockwise order. Due to the symmetry and the equal spacing of the points around the circle, we have (A_{2013} = A_1, A_{2014} = A_2, ldots). 4. Observe that the set of points forms regular intervals. To aid in solving the problem, we group the points into sets of four as follows:    [    (A_1, A_2, A_{1007}, A_{1008}),    (A_3, A_4, A_{1009}, A_{1010}),    ldots,    (A_{1005}, A_{1006}, A_{2011}, A_{2012}).    ]    Note that we have 503 such quartets. 5. Consider any convex (k)-gon where all selected points belong entirely to one of these quartets, ( (A_{2i-1}, A_{2i}, A_{2i + 1005}, A_{2i + 1006}) ):    - In this case, the sides (A_{2i-1} A_{2i}) and (A_{2i + 1005} A_{2i + 1006}) are symmetrical with respect to the center of the circle and thus parallel.    - Therefore, to avoid having any parallel sides, we cannot select all four points from any quartet. This implies that at most three vertices from each group of four can be chosen. 6. Since there are 503 such groups, the total number of points we could select without having parallel sides in any convex (k)-gon is:    [    k leq 503 times 3 = 1509.    ] 7. We now need to prove that there exists a configuration of 1509 points that indeed forms a convex (1509)-gon with no parallel sides. Consider selecting the following:    - All points from (A_1) to (A_{1006}) and all even-numbered points from (A_{1008}) to (A_{2012}). 8.

This implies |AB| = a - asqrt{1 - frac{16}{9b^2}}. Since ABPQ is a parallelogram, we have |AB| = |PQ| = 2asqrt{1 - frac{16}{9b^2}}.

Let's analyze the given information step by step: 1. **Determining f(0)**: We know that f(x_{1}+x_{2})=f(x_{1})+f(x_{2}). By setting both x_1 and x_2 to 0, we get f(0+0)=f(0)+f(0) Rightarrow f(0)=2f(0).

Since f(x) is an odd function, f(x^{2}) is even, and both 2^{f(x)} and 2^{-f(x)} are even functions as well (since f(-x)=-f(x) implies 2^{f(-x)}=2^{-f(x)}), making g(x) an even function on mathbb{R}. Moreover, since f(x) is increasing, g(x) is monotonically increasing on left[0,+infty right). 6. **Finding the Solution Set**: Since g(x) is even and increasing on left[0,+infty right), and given that g(1)=frac{7}{2}, the inequality g(x)leqslant g(1) holds for -1leqslant xleqslant 1.

The overall loss is the loss from the 80% stock minus the profit from the 20% stock, which is given as Rs. 350.

(blacksquare) 4. **Corollary:**    - **Statement:** The set of blue squares in any row is contiguous.    - **Proof:**      - If not, we could partition that row into ( 1 times k ) rectangles in more than one way.      - Proceeding as described in Lemma 1 would result in at least two possible ways to partition the grid, contradicting the uniqueness of the partitioning. (blacksquare)    - A similar statement holds for columns. 5. **Lemma 2:**    - **Statement:** Any non-blue square ( s ) cannot have two blue neighbors.    - **Proof:**      - By the corollary, we only need to prove this when the two blue neighbors are not in the same row or column.      - Let ( n_1 ) be the blue neighbor in the same row and ( n_2 ) be the blue neighbor in the same column.      - Use the algorithm described in Lemma 1 to get a partition with ( n_1, s ) in the same rectangle but not ( n_2 ), and another with ( n_2, s ) in the same rectangle but not ( n_1 ).      - This results in a contradiction, proving the lemma. (blacksquare) 6. **Lemma 3:**    - **Statement:** If ( a, b ) are blue squares which aren't in the same row or the same column, then the rectangle with ( a, b ) as opposite corners is entirely blue.    - **Proof:**      - Assume ( a ) is lower than ( b ) and to the left of ( b ).      - Consider the path ( a, s_1, s_2, ldots, s_k, b ) which first goes up and then to the right, moving one step each time.      - Let ( s_t ) be the turning point, i.e., ( s_t ) is above ( s_{t-1} ) and to the left of ( s_{t+1} ).      - If any ( s_i ) is not blue, then ( s_t ) is not blue by the corollary.      - Suppose ( s_t ) is not blue. Let ( 0 le i < t ) be the largest ( i ) with ( s_i ) blue, where ( s_0 = a ) by convention.      - Let ( t < j le k+1 ) be the smallest ( j ) with ( s_j ) blue, where ( s_{k+1} = b ) by convention.      - Apply the algorithm in Lemma 1 to get a partitioning where ( s_i, s_t ) are in the same rectangle but not ( s_j ), and another where ( s_j, s_t ) are in the same rectangle but not ( s_i ).      - These give a contradiction, so all ( s_i )'s are blue.      - Using Lemma 2, we can prove that the entire rectangle is blue. (blacksquare) 7. **Conclusion:**    - Lemma 3 implies that the set of blue squares forms a rectangle.    - The set of blue squares must be a ( 1 times 101 ) rectangle, which implies ( n ge 101 ).

Each of these configurations must form a 45-45-90 triangle, where the legs of the triangle can either be aligned along the rows and columns or along the diagonals of the board.  1. **First Case: Legs Parallel to the Axes**    In this configuration, the queens form the vertices of a square (since triangle with (90^{circ}) and identical legs form the (triangle ABC Rightarrow AB=BC=CA Rightarrow text{Square})).    Each selection of four cells shaped into a square (2×2, 3×3, and so on) corresponds to four possible ways to place the queens.

We need to prove that ( k(n-k) ) is divisible by 2 for all positive integers ( k ). 2. Consider the parity (odd or even nature) of ( k ):    - If ( k ) is even, then ( k ) is divisible by 2, and hence ( k(n-k) ) is divisible by 2.    - If ( k ) is odd, then ( n-k ) is even because ( n ) is odd and the difference between an odd number and an odd number is even. Therefore, ( n-k ) is divisible by 2, and hence ( k(n-k) ) is divisible by 2. 3. In both cases, ( k(n-k) ) is divisible by 2. (blacksquare) # Part (b) 1. We need to find an integer ( k ) such that ( k(100-k) ) is not divisible by 11. 2. Consider the expression ( k(100-k) mod 11 ):    - We need ( k(100-k) notequiv 0 mod 11 ). 3. Let's test ( k = 2 ):    - ( k(100-k) = 2(100-2) = 2 times 98 = 196 ).    - ( 196 mod 11 = 9 ). 4. Since ( 9 notequiv 0 mod 11 ), ( k = 2 ) is a valid solution. (boxed{k = 2}) # Part (c) 1. Let ( p ) be an odd prime and ( n ) be an integer. We need to prove that there is an integer ( k ) such that ( k(n-k) ) is not divisible by ( p ). 2. Consider the residues of ( k ) and ( n ) modulo ( p ):    - Let ( k equiv a mod p ) and ( n equiv b mod p ). 3. Since ( p ) is an odd prime, the residues modulo ( p ) are ( 0, 1, 2, ldots, p-1 ). 4. We need to choose ( k ) such that ( k(n-k) notequiv 0 mod p ):    - Avoid ( k equiv 0 mod p ) because ( k equiv 0 mod p ) implies ( k(n-k) equiv 0 mod p ).    - Choose ( k ) such that ( a neq b mod p ). 5. Since there are ( p ) residues and only one residue ( b ) to avoid, there are ( p-1 ) choices for ( k ) such that ( k(n-k) notequiv 0 mod p ). (blacksquare) # Part (d) 1. Let ( p ) and ( q ) be two different odd primes, and ( n ) be an integer. We need to prove that there is an integer ( k ) such that ( k(n-k) ) is not divisible by any of ( p ) or ( q ). 2. Consider the residues of ( k ) and ( n ) modulo ( p ) and ( q ):    - Let ( k equiv a mod p ) and ( n equiv b mod p ).    - Let ( k equiv c mod q ) and ( n equiv d mod q ). 3. We need to choose ( k ) such that ( k(n-k) notequiv 0 mod p ) and ( k(n-k) notequiv 0 mod q ):    - Avoid ( k equiv 0 mod p ) and ( k equiv b mod p ).    - Avoid ( k equiv 0 mod q ) and ( k equiv d mod q ). 4. Since ( p ) and ( q ) are different primes, the Chinese Remainder Theorem guarantees that there are solutions to the system of congruences:    - ( k notequiv 0 mod p )    - ( k notequiv b mod p )    - ( k notequiv 0 mod q )    - ( k notequiv d mod q ) 5.

From the first equation, we have log_{2}sqrt{2y+1}=3-y. This can be rewritten using the property of logarithms as: [2^{3-y}=sqrt{2y+1}] Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root gives us: [2^{2(3-y)}=2y+1] Simplifying the exponent on the left side, we get: [2^{6-2y}=2y+1] 2. Let's introduce a substitution to simplify our equation. Let t=6-2y. This implies that 2y=6-t. Substituting t into our equation gives us: [2^{t}=2y+1] But since 2y=6-t, we can rewrite this as: [2^{t}+t=7] 3. We are also given that 2^{x}+x=7. Comparing this with the equation we derived, 2^{t}+t=7, we notice that both x and t satisfy the same equation. 4. Given that the function y=2^{x}+x-7 is strictly increasing, it means that for any two different values of x, their corresponding y values will also be different. Therefore, if 2^{x}+x=7 and 2^{t}+t=7 have the same solution, it must be that t=x. 5. Substituting t=x into the equation t=6-2y, we get: [x=6-2y] Rearranging this equation to solve for x+2y, we find: [x+2y=6] Therefore, the solution to the problem, x+2y, is boxed{6}."},{"instruction":"Using the updated bar graph, what is the positive difference between the school with the largest enrollment and the school with the smallest enrollment?

Initially, 100 planes take off from point A, each with a full tank of fuel, capable of flying 1000 km with a full tank. 2.

The distance flown by all planes before the first plane lands can be calculated as:    [    1000 times frac{1}{100} = 10 text{ km}    ]    This is because each plane has just used (frac{1}{100}) of its fuel capacity. 4.

We observe that:     [     2n + 1 = (n+1)^2 - n^2     ]     This is because:     [     (n+1)^2 - n^2 = n^2 + 2n + 1 - n^2 = 2n + 1     ]     Hence, any odd number can be represented as the difference of two squares. 2. **Understanding Representation of Even Numbers That Are Multiples of 4**:     Any even number that is a multiple of 4 can be expressed in the form (4m).     We observe that:     [     4m = (m+1)^2 - (m-1)^2     ]     This is because:     [     (m+1)^2 - (m-1)^2 = m^2 + 2m + 1 - (m^2 - 2m + 1) = 4m     ]     Thus, any number that is a multiple of 4 can be represented as the difference of two squares. 3. **Numbers that cannot be represented as differences of squares**:          We now consider numbers of the form (4n + 2). These numbers cannot be expressed as the difference of two squares. This follows from the properties of squares under modulo operations:          - A square number modulo 4 can only yield a remainder of 0 or 1.     - Hence, any difference of two squares modulo 4 must result in a difference of 0, 1, or 3. Any number of the form (4n + 2) is thus impossible to achieve. 4. **Counting numbers of the form (4n + 2) from 1 to 1000**:     Within any group of four consecutive integers, exactly one number has the form (4n + 2).

Let's break down the solution into detailed steps: 1. **Symmetry of f(x) around x=1:** Since it is given that y=f(x+1) is an even function, we can infer that the function f(x) is symmetric about the line x=1. This is because if f(x+1) is even, then f(1+x) = f(1-x), which directly translates to the symmetry of f(x) around x=1. 2. **Monotonicity of f(x) on left(-infty, 1right]:** It is given that for any x_1, x_2 in left(-infty, 1right] and x_1 neq x_2, we have (x_1-x_2)(f(x_2)-f(x_1)) > 0. This condition means that if x_1 < x_2, then f(x_1) > f(x_2), indicating that f(x) is monotonically decreasing on the interval left(-infty, 1right]. To see this more clearly, rearranging the given inequality yields (x_1-x_2)(f(x_1)-f(x_2)) < 0, which further supports the fact that f(x) decreases as x increases within left(-infty, 1right]. 3. **Impact of symmetry and monotonicity on f(x) values:** Given the symmetry of f(x) about x=1 and its decreasing nature on left(-infty, 1right], we can deduce how f(x) behaves across different values of x. Specifically, as x moves further away from the axis of symmetry (x=1), in either direction, the value of f(x) increases due to the even nature and the monotonicity on the left side of the axis. Therefore, considering the points 0, frac{3}{2}, and -3, we find that f(-3), being farthest from 1 on the left, has the highest value, followed by f(0), and then fleft(frac{3}{2}right), which is the closest to the axis of symmetry on the right side. 4. **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, we conclude that f(-3) > f(0) > fleft(frac{3}{2}right).

From the first information, we have: N = 44 * 432 + R1 where R1 is the remainder when N is divided by 44. From the second information, we have: N = 30 * Q2 + 18 where Q2 is the quotient when N is divided by 30. Since N is the same in both cases, we can set the two equations equal to each other: 44 * 432 + R1 = 30 * Q2 + 18 We need to find R1, the remainder when N is divided by 44. To do this, we need to find a value for Q2 that makes the right side of the equation divisible by 44, leaving us with the remainder R1. Let's first calculate 44 * 432: 44 * 432 = 19008 Now we have: 19008 + R1 = 30 * Q2 + 18 We know that 19008 is divisible by 44, so we need to find a multiple of 30 that, when added to 18, gives us a number that is just over a multiple of 44.  Let's find the remainder when 19008 is divided by 30 to see how much we need to add to get to a multiple of 30: 19008 mod 30 = 8 This means that when 19008 is divided by 30, the remainder is 8. To get to the next multiple of 30, we would need to add 22 (since 30 - 8 = 22). However, we are told that when N is divided by 30, the remainder is 18, not 22. This means that the number we are looking for is 18 - 8 = 10 more than 19008. So, let's add 10 to 19008: 19008 + 10 = 19018 Now, 19018 is the number that, when divided by 30, gives us a remainder of 18. We need to find the remainder when 19018 is divided by 44. 19018 mod 44 = R1 To find R1, we can simply calculate 19018 divided by 44 and find the remainder: 19018 mod 44 = 18 Therefore, the remainder in the first division (when the number is divided by 44) is boxed{18} ."},{"instruction":"Andrew, Boris, Svetlana, and Larisa are four people of different ages, forming two married couples.

Understanding the Clues - **Clue 1:** The oldest person is Larisa’s husband. - **Clue 2:** Andrey is younger than Svetlana but older than Larisa. From **Clue 1**, we can deduce that the oldest person is a man, and he is married to Larisa. Let’s denote this oldest person as Boris due to the pairings. Therefore, Boris is Larisa’s husband. From **Clue 2**, we know: - Andrey < Svetlana - Larisa < Andrey So the possible order of ages from youngest to oldest is: Larisa < Andrey < Svetlana < Boris.  2. Determining the Pairings - Since Boris is the oldest and Larisa’s husband, that means Andrey must be married to Svetlana because Larisa is married to Boris.  3. Evaluating Statements Let’s evaluate each statement provided in the problem: - **Statement 1:** Andrey is older than Boris and is married to Svetlana.   - This statement contradicts our ordering since Boris is the oldest, and Andrey is not older than Boris.    - **Statement 2:** Andrey is older than his wife Svetlana.   - This is incorrect because according to **Clue 2**, Andrey is younger than Svetlana.    - **Statement 3:** The youngest person is Larisa, and she is married to Boris.   - This is true because our order is Larisa < Andrey < Svetlana < Boris, and we already established Boris is married to Larisa.    - **Statement 4:** Svetlana is older than Larisa, and her husband is Boris.   - Svetlana is indeed older than Larisa, but her husband is not Boris. Hence, this statement is incorrect.    - **Statement 5:** Larisa is older than her husband Andrey.   - This is incorrect because Andrey is older than Larisa.    - **Statement 6:** Boris and Svetlana are not married.   - This statement is true, as Svetlana is married to Andrey, not Boris. # Conclusion:    Based on our analysis, the correct statement is: [ boxed{text{The youngest is Larisa, and she is married to Boris}} ]"},{"instruction":"Given sets A={(x,y) mid (1a)x^2+2xyay^2leq 0} and B={(x,y) mid 3x5y geq 0, x, y > 0}, and B subseteq A, find the minimum value of the real number a.","output":"Since set B is defined as B={(x,y) mid 3x-5y geq 0, x, y > 0}, this can be rewritten as B=left{(x,y) mid frac{x}{y} geq frac{5}{3}right} because x and y are both positive and thus dividing by y maintains the inequality.

Convert the given polar coordinate equation of line l to its corresponding Cartesian coordinate equation:    The polar coordinate equation of line l is 2rho sin (theta - frac{pi }{4})=sqrt{2}. Converting to Cartesian coordinates, we have:    y = rho sin(theta) and x = rho cos(theta)    y - x = sqrt{2} sin(theta - frac{pi}{4}) = sqrt{2} (frac{sqrt{2}}{2}sin(theta) - frac{sqrt{2}}{2}cos(theta)) = y - x    Thus, the Cartesian coordinate equation of line l is y - x = 1. 2. Find the Cartesian coordinates of point A:    The polar coordinates of point A are A(2sqrt{2}, frac{7pi}{4}). Converting to Cartesian coordinates, we have:    x = rho cos(theta) = 2sqrt{2}cos(frac{7pi}{4}) = 2    y = rho sin(theta) = 2sqrt{2}sin(frac{7pi}{4}) = -2    Thus, the Cartesian coordinates of point A are (2, -2). 3.

There are two scenarios in which the product xy can be even: 1. x is even and y is any number from its set. 2. y is even (which is 6) and x is any number from its set. Let's calculate the probability for each scenario: 1. The probability that x is even is 2/6 (since there are 2 even numbers out of 6 total numbers in the set for x). The probability that y is any number is 1 (since it can be any of the 5 numbers in its set). So the probability for this scenario is (2/6) * 1 = 2/6. 2. The probability that y is even is 1/5 (since there is 1 even number out of 5 total numbers in the set for y). The probability that x is any number is 1 (since it can be any of the 6 numbers in its set). So the probability for this scenario is (1/5) * 1 = 1/5. Now, we need to combine these probabilities, but we must be careful not to double-count the scenario where both x and y are even (which is when x=2 or 4 and y=6). This scenario is included in both of the probabilities we calculated, so we subtract it once to get the correct total probability. The probability that both x and y are even is (2/6) * (1/5) = 2/30. So the total probability that xy is even is the sum of the probabilities of the two scenarios minus the probability that both are even: Total probability = (2/6) + (1/5) - (2/30) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 30 in this case: Total probability = (10/30) + (6/30) - (2/30) Total probability = (16/30) - (2/30) Total probability = 14/30 Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2: Total probability = 7/15 So, the probability that xy will be even is boxed{7/15} ."},{"instruction":"Among the numbers from 1 to 2n, n+1 numbers are chosen.

If there was no delay, the motorcyclist would have traveled 80 km in t hours where:    [    t = frac{80 text{ km}}{x text{ km/h}}    ] 3. After the delay, the motorcyclist covers the 80 km distance at a speed of x + 10 km/h and it takes him t - 0.4 hours to cover this distance:    [    t - 0.4 = frac{80 text{ km}}{x + 10 text{ km/h}}    ] 4. We now have two equations:    [    t = frac{80}{x}    ]    [    t - 0.4 = frac{80}{x + 10}    ] 5. Substitute the value of t from the first equation into the second equation:    [    frac{80}{x} - 0.4 = frac{80}{x + 10}    ] 6. Solve the equation for x:    [    frac{80}{x} - frac{80}{x+10} = 0.4    ] 7. Combine the fractions on the left-hand side:    [    frac{80(x + 10) - 80x}{x(x + 10)} = 0.4    ] 8. Simplify the numerator:    [    frac{80x + 800 - 80x}{x(x + 10)} = 0.4    ] 9. This reduces to:    [    frac{800}{x(x + 10)} = 0.4    ] 10. Multiply both sides by x(x + 10):     [     800 = 0.4x(x + 10)     ] 11. Distribute 0.4x on the right-hand side:     [     800 = 0.4x^2 + 4x     ] 12. Divide the entire equation by 0.4 to simplify:     [     2000 = x^2 + 10x     ] 13. Rearrange into a standard form quadratic equation:     [     x^2 + 10x - 2000 = 0     ] 14. Solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula where a = 1, b = 10, and c = -2000:     [     x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}     ]     [     x = frac{-10 pm sqrt{10^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot (-2000)}}{2 cdot 1}     ]     [     x = frac{-10 pm sqrt{100 + 8000}}{2}     ]     [     x = frac{-10 pm sqrt{8100}}{2}     ]     [     x = frac{-10 pm 90}{2}     ] 15. This gives us two solutions:     [     x = frac{80}{2} = 40 quadtext{and}quad x = frac{-100}{2} = -50     ] 16. Since speed cannot be negative, we take the positive solution:     [     x = 40 text{ km/h}     ] # Conclusion: The speed of the motorcyclist before the delay is ( boxed{40 text{ km/h}} )."},{"instruction":"f a:b=2:3, then left(a+bright):b=____.","output":"Given that a:b=2:3, we can express this relationship as frac{a}{b}=frac{2}{3}.

Therefore, there are 5 choices for the units place. 2. **Hundreds place (the first digit)**: The first digit cannot be 0 (to ensure it's a three-digit number) and it must be different from the digit chosen for the units place. Therefore, there are 9 choices for the hundreds place (10 total digits minus 1 already chosen for the units place). 3. **Tens place (the middle digit)**: This digit must be different from the ones chosen for the hundreds and units places. Therefore, there are 8 choices left for the tens place. Multiplying the number of choices for each position together, we get the total number of possible three-digit even numbers without repeating digits: 5 times 9 times 8 = 360. However, we must consider that when the units place is chosen as 0, the hundreds place actually has 9 options (since 0 is now a valid option for the hundreds place, but we cannot repeat the digit chosen for the units place).

To correct this, we calculate the scenario where the units place is 0 separately: - **Units place is 0**: There are 1 choice for the units place, 9 choices for the hundreds place (any digit but 0), and 8 choices for the tens place. This gives 1 times 9 times 8 = 72 possible numbers. Subtracting this from the initial total, we get the corrected total number of possible numbers: 360 - 72 = 288.

A string is palindromic if it is the same when read backwards.)","output":"To solve the problem of finding the number of distinct permutations of the letters of the word REDDER that do not contain a palindromic substring of length at least two, we first analyze which substrings give a palindrome. 1. **Definition of Palindromic Substring:**     - A palindromic substring is a contiguous block of letters that reads the same forwards and backwards.     - For example, in the string \\"abcba\\", \\"a\\", \\"b\\", \\"c\\", \\"abcba\\", \\"bcb\\", etc., are palindromic substrings. 2. **Criteria for Palindromes in Permutations of REDDER:**     - Because the word has repeated letters, if two identical letters are adjacent or separated by a single letter (like _X_X), they will form palindromic substrings of length two or three, respectively. 3. **First Letter Choice:**     - Let’s call the first letter (A). This letter can be (R), (E), or (D). 4. **Subsequent Letter Choices:**     - Let’s denote the remaining letters (B) and (C), which also can be any permutations of (R, E, D).     - To avoid palindromes, each of the sets of consecutive three letters needs to be different. Say:       - The second letter (must not equal (A)): (B).       - The third letter (must not equal (A) or (B)): (C). 5. **Arranging the Sequence:**     - This pattern needs to continue for all six letters:       - The fourth letter (must be different from the third and the second): (A).       - The fifth letter (must be different from the fourth and third): (B).       - The sixth letter (must be different from the fifth and fourth): (C).     - This ensures no pairs like AA, BB, CC or patterns like ABA, BAB, CAC happen. 6. **General Form:**     - The valid form of the permutation then follows a specific cyclic pattern: (ABCABC). 7. **Permutations Count:**     - (A), (B), and (C) can each be (R), (E), or (D), with no repetition. Hence, they can be any permutation of these three letters.     - The number of such permutations of (R, E, D) is (3!), which is calculated as:       [       3! = 3 times 2 times 1 = 6       ] Thus, there are 6 distinct permutations of the letters of the word REDDER that do not contain a palindromic substring of length at least two.

Prove that it is possible to draw n line segments with endpoints of different colors, such that none of the segments intersect.","output":"We are given n red points and n blue points on a plane, with no three points collinear. We aim to demonstrate that it is possible to connect the points with n segments, each segment connecting a red point to a blue point, such that no two segments intersect. To achieve this, follow these steps: 1. **Set Up and Assumptions**: Consider the set of all possible partitions where each partition includes pairs of points, one red and one blue. Importantly, we are to ensure that the sum of the lengths of the segments in the partition is the smallest possible. 2. **Consider Each Pairing**: There are finitely many ways to pair the red and blue points since we are restricted to n points of each color. Thus, among these configurations, there exists a pairing where the total length of all the segments is minimized. 3. **Minimize Total Length**: Let us denote one such minimum length configuration by {(R_1, B_1), (R_2, B_2), ..., (R_n, B_n)}. This means the sum of the lengths of the segments between these pairs is the smallest possible compared to any other configuration of pairs. 4. **Proving Non-Intersections**:    - Assume, for contradiction, that two segments in this minimal sum configuration intersect. Let's say (R_i, B_i) and (R_j, B_j) intersect.    - If these segments intersect, they form a convex quadrilateral because no three points are collinear. Therefore, we can redraw the diagonals of this quadrilateral. The original intersecting segments can then be replaced with the non-intersecting segments (R_i, B_j) and (R_j, B_i). 5. **Contradiction Expected**:     - When segments (R_i, B_i) and (R_j, B_j) are replaced by (R_i, B_j) and (R_j, B_i), by the triangle inequality and properties of convex quadrilaterals, the combined length of (R_i, B_j) and (R_j, B_i) is strictly less than the combined length of (R_i, B_i) and (R_j, B_j).  6. **Inference from Contradiction**:    - The new configuration would have a smaller total length, contradicting our initial assumption that our chosen pairing had the smallest sum of segment lengths.     Since our configuration should have the smallest possible total length, it must follow that our initial assumption of having intersecting segments is wrong. Thus, in the configuration with the smallest total length, no two segments can intersect. # Conclusion: Therefore, it is indeed possible to draw n segments each connecting a red point to a blue point without any segments intersecting.

Since a and b are 6-digit numbers with all digits even, the possible digits are 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.

Method: 1. **Define Events**:     - Let A be the event that we roll a five before we roll a six.     - Let B be the event that we roll a six before we roll a five.     - Let C be the event that neither A nor B happens within the first finite number of rolls (i.e., we never roll a five or a six). 2. **Relationships**:     - Since P(A) = P(B) and these events are mutually exclusive and exhaustive (either A or B must happen eventually if C were zero),              P(A) + P(B) + P(C) = 1 implies 2P(A) + P(C) = 1        3. **Calculate P(C)**:     - Calculate the probability of C:              P(C) = 1 - sum_{k=1}^{infty} left( frac{4}{6} right)^{k-1} cdot frac{2}{6}            - This simplifies as follows:              P(C) = 1 - frac{2}{6} sum_{k=0}^{infty} left( frac{4}{6} right)^k = 1 - frac{2}{6} cdot frac{1}{1 - frac{4}{6}} = 1 - frac{2}{6} cdot 3 = 1 - 1 = 0        4. **Solving for P(A)**:     - Substituting P(C) = 0 into the original equation:                2P(A) + 0 = 1 implies P(A) = frac{1}{2}         5. **Conclusion**:     - Therefore, the probability that we roll a six before we roll a five, without rolling a five in the meantime, is:              boxed{frac{1}{2}}"},{"instruction":"Compute [dfrac{3^31}{3^3+1}cdotdfrac{4^31}{4^3+1}cdotdfrac{5^31}{5^3+1}cdotdfrac{6^31}{6^3+1}cdotdfrac{7^31}{7^3+1}.]","output":"Let T be the value of the given expression.

Therefore, - f(-1) = -1 = f(5) - f(0) = 0 = f(6) - f(1) = 1 - f(2) = 2 We know that f(x) is periodic with a period of 6, hence the six values of f(x) for an entire period would repeat themselves.

Here, ( t ) is the time index and ( f(t) = t + j(t) ) represents the time when the ball thrown at time ( t ) lands, given that ( j(t) ) is the number of beats in the future when the ball is to be caught. 2. **Drawing Curves in the Interval:**    We only draw the curves whose left endpoint (throw) lies in the interval ([0, M n - 1]), where ( M ) is an integer multiplier and ( n ) is the length of the sequence. 3. **Sum of Lengths for a Single Ball:**    For every single ball, the sum of the lengths of the curves (arrows) corresponding to that ball falls into the interval ([M n - J, M n + J]), where ( J = max {j(0), j(1), ldots, j(n-1)}). This construction ensures that each ball travels through these curves summed over all intervals of length ( n ). 4. **Total Sum of Lengths:**    Therefore, the total sum of the lengths of the curves drawn lies between:    [    b(M n - J) quad text{and} quad b(M n + J).    ]        Since the arrow drawn at time ( t ) has length ( j(bar{t}) ), the sum of the lengths of all such arrows for the sequence is:    [    M(j(0) + j(1) + cdots + j(n-1)).    ] 5. **Establishing the Inequality:**    This yields the inequality:    [    b(M n - J) leq M(j(0) + j(1) + cdots + j(n-1)) leq b(M n + J).    ] 6. **Dividing by ( M n ):**    We divide the entire inequality by ( M n ) to normalize it:    [    bleft(1 - frac{J}{n M}right) leq frac{j(0) + j(1) + cdots + j(n-1)}{n} leq bleft(1 + frac{J}{n M}right).    ] 7. **Taking ( M ) Arbitrarily Large:**    Since we can choose ( M ) to be arbitrarily large, the terms ( frac{J}{n M} ) diminish towards zero. As ( M to infty ), this implies:    [    bleft(1 - frac{J}{n M}right) to b quad text{and} quad bleft(1 + frac{J}{n M}right) to b.    ]        Therefore, the inequality converges to:    [    b = frac{j(0) + j(1) + cdots + j(n-1)}{n}.    ] # Conclusion:    Thus, we have shown that the number of balls ( b ) in the juggling sequence is simply the average of the sequence ( j(0), j(1), cdots, j(n-1) ):    [    b = frac{j(0) + j(1) + cdots + j(n-1)}{n}.    ]    boxed{}"},{"instruction":"Given that the cost C (in tenthousand yuan) of manufacturing a certain brand car is related to the monthly production x (in units) by the function C = 100 + 4x, and the unit price p is related to the production x by the function p = 25  frac{1}{8}x, assuming all products are sold.

Therefore, we have 7 units in total to arrange: the Beijing unit, two representatives from Shanghai, two from Tianjin, and two from Chongqing. First, we arrange the 7 units, which can be done in 6! ways because we treat the Beijing unit as one. Then, we have to arrange the two Beijing representatives within their unit, which can be done in 2! ways. Next, we need to consider the restriction for the Chongqing representatives. To calculate the number of arrangements where the Chongqing representatives are not next to each other, we subtract the arrangements where they are next to each other from the total arrangements without restrictions. Without the restriction, the two Chongqing representatives can be considered as a single unit, similar to the Beijing representatives. Therefore, we have 6 units to arrange (the Beijing unit, the Chongqing unit, two representatives from Shanghai, and two from Tianjin), which can be done in 5! ways. Within the Chongqing unit, there are 2! ways to arrange the two representatives. So, the number of arrangements where the Chongqing representatives are next to each other is 5! times 2!.

Now, let's verify whose meeting took place closer to city ( A ). We know ( v_I = 2v_P ) and ( v_{Iv} = 3v_{P'} ). As ( v_P = 2v_{P'} ), we get: [ v_I = 2(2v_{P'}) = 4v_{P'} ] [ v_{Iv} = 3v_{P'} ] Notice: [ d_P = v_P cdot t ] [ d_P = 2v_{P'} cdot t ] [ d_{Iv} = 3v_{P'} cdot t ] Given ( v_I > v_{Iv} ), the distance travel by Ivanov is more: [ d_I = 4v_{P'} cdot t ] Since both pairs meet simultaneously: - Ivanov meeting Petrovskiy: [ d_I + d_{P'} = D ] [ 4v_{P'} cdot t + v_{P'} cdot t = D ] [ 5v_{P'} cdot t = D ] - Petrov meeting Ivanovskiy: [ d_P + d_{Iv} = D ] [ 2v_{P'} cdot t + 3v_{P'} cdot t = D ] [ 5v_{P'} cdot t = D ] Hence, since ( d_I > d_P ), the meeting point of Ivanov and Ivanovskiy is closer to city ( A ).

Prove that we can select 13 of them that can be covered by a circle with a unit radius.","output":"1. **Initialization**: Let us start by selecting an arbitrary point from the given 25 points. Around this point, we draw a circle with a radius of 1 unit. 2. **Check coverage by initial circle**:     - If this circle covers at least 13 points, then these points are suitable, and the circle, along with the group of points it covers, is a valid solution.    - Suppose this initial circle does not cover at least 13 points, implying that it covers at most 12 points. 3. **Properties of uncovered points**:    - Consider the remaining points that are not covered by this circle. According to the problem, any two points among these must have a distance smaller than 1.    - This follows because if we take the selected initial point and any two points from the uncovered points, the distance from these two points to the initial point must be greater than or equal to 1 (since they lie outside the circle of radius 1 around the initial point), meaning the distance between these two points needs to be less than 1 (by the problem conditions). 4. **Select a new point**:     - Choose one of these uncovered points and draw another circle with a radius of 1 unit around this new point. 5. **Coverage by the new circle**:    - By the initial observation, this new circle will cover all the remaining uncovered points.    - Since the first circle covered at most 12 points, this new circle must cover at least 25 - 12 = 13 points. 6. **Conclusion**:    - Thus, even if the first circle does not cover at least 13 points, a second circle centered on one of the uncovered points will cover all the remaining points, ensuring it covers at least 13 points.    - This completes the proof, confirming that we can always find 13 points that can be covered by a circle with a radius of 1 unit. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Let A=(0,10) and B=(0,15).

The angle bisectors of angle mathrm{ABC} and angle mathrm{BDC} intersect at point mathrm{K}. We need to prove that mathrm{AK} = mathrm{BK}. 1. **Identify Angles**:    - Let angle mathrm{ABC} = 2 beta.     - Since mathrm{K} is on the angle bisector of angle mathrm{ABC}, then angle mathrm{ABK} = beta.    - Since mathrm{K} is also on the angle bisector of angle mathrm{BDC}, then angle mathrm{CDK} = beta as well. 2. **Calculate Angle angle mathrm{ADK}**:    - angle mathrm{ADK} = 180^circ - angle mathrm{CDK} = 180^circ - beta. 3. **Consider Quadrilateral mathrm{ADKB}**:    - We need to check if mathrm{ADKB} is a cyclic quadrilateral.     - In any cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of opposite angles is always 180^circ.     - Here, angle mathrm{ABK} = beta and angle mathrm{ADK} = 180^circ - beta.    - Hence, angle mathrm{ABK} + angle mathrm{ADK} = beta + (180^circ - beta) = 180^circ.    - Thus, mathrm{ADKB} is a cyclic quadrilateral. 4. **Angles Subtended by the Same Arc**:    - In a cyclic quadrilateral, angles subtended by the same arc are equal.     - Therefore, angle mathrm{BAK} = angle mathrm{BDK} = beta. 5. **Isosceles Triangle Conclusion**:    - Since angle mathrm{BAK} = angle mathrm{BDK} = beta, the lengths mathrm{AK} and mathrm{BK} are equal (by the properties of isosceles triangles where two angles are equal).    - Hence, triangle mathrm{AKB} is isosceles, and mathrm{AK} = mathrm{BK}. 6. **Conclusion**:    - We have shown that mathrm{AK} = mathrm{BK} by considering angle properties and a cyclic quadrilateral.

This means that for every 100 movies L&J Productions makes, Johnny TV makes 100 + P movies. Given that L&J Productions produces 220 movies in a year, Johnny TV would produce 220 * (100 + P)/100 movies in a year. The total number of movies produced by both companies in one year would be: 220 (L&J Productions) + 220 * (100 + P)/100 (Johnny TV) In five years, the total number of movies produced by both companies would be: 5 * [220 + 220 * (100 + P)/100] We are given that the two production companies produce 2475 movies in five years combined. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 5 * [220 + 220 * (100 + P)/100] = 2475 Simplifying the equation: 1100 + 1100 * (100 + P)/100 = 495 Dividing both sides by 5: 220 + 220 * (100 + P)/100 = 495 Now, let's solve for P: 220 * (100 + P)/100 = 495 - 220 220 * (100 + P)/100 = 275 Now, we multiply both sides by 100/220 to isolate (100 + P): (100 + P) = (275 * 100) / 220 (100 + P) = 27500 / 220 (100 + P) = 125 Now we subtract 100 from both sides to find P: P = 125 - 100 P = 25 Therefore, Johnny TV makes boxed{25%}  more movies than L&J Productions each year."},{"instruction":"There were 50 kinds of sandwiches on the menu.

Let (E) and (F) be the intersection points of (AD) with the lines (OB) and (OC), respectively. 1. **Calculate Angle at the Center:**    Since the 18-sided polygon is regular, each central angle subtended by the sides is:    [    angle AOB = angle BOC = angle COD = frac{360^circ}{18} = 20^circ.    ] 2. **Determine (angle AOD):**        The angle (AOD) spans three sides:    [    angle AOD = 3 cdot angle AOB = 3 cdot 20^circ = 60^circ.    ]    Since (angle AOD) equals (60^circ), (triangle AOD) is an equilateral triangle, implying:    [    AD = AO = 1.    ]     3. **Calculate (angle BAD):**        Using the property of the central angle and inscribed angle theorem:    [    angle BAD = frac{1}{2} cdot angle BOD = frac{1}{2} cdot 40^circ = 20^circ.    ] 4. **Use the Similarity of Triangles:**    Triangles (BAE) and (AOB) have two corresponding angles equal:     [    angle BAE = angle AOB = 20^circ,    ]        and they share the angle at (A), proving (triangle BAE sim triangle AOB).    Therefore, their sides are proportional:    begin{gather*}    frac{EB}{AB} = frac{AB}{AO}, quad EB = frac{AB^2}{AO} = frac{a^2}{1} = a^2,     frac{AE}{AB} = frac{AO}{OB} = 1, quad AE = AB = a.    end{gather*} 5. **Identify (OEF) as an Isosceles Triangle:**    By the similarity and because (triangle OEF) has angles    [    angle EOF = angle BOA = 20^circ, quad angle OEF = angle OAB = 80^circ.    ]    This confirms that ( triangle OEF sim triangle OAB ). 6. **Calculate (OE) and (EF):**        [    OE = OB - EB = 1 - a^2,    ]        [    EF = AD - 2 cdot AE = 1 - 2a.    ] 7. **Set Up the Proportionality Relation:**    By similarity of (triangle OEF) and (triangle OAB):    [    frac{OA}{AB} = frac{OE}{EF}, quad frac{1}{a} = frac{1 - a^2}{1 - 2a}.    ] 8. **Solve for (a):**    Cross-multiplying the equality:    [    1 cdot (1 - 2a) = a cdot (1 - a^2),    ]    expanding and rearranging terms:    [    1 - 2a = a - a^3,    ]    giving us:    [    a^3 - 3a + 1 = 0.    ]    Therefore, we have shown the required identity    [    a^3 = 3a - 1.    ] # Conclusion: The solution confirms that the side length (a) of a regular 18-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle satisfies the cubic equation: [ boxed{a^3 = 3a - 1}. ]"},{"instruction":"Given a sequence {a_n} with the sum of its first n terms S_n = frac{n^2 + 3n}{4}, for n in mathbb{N}^*, 1.

For any two competitors, it is known that there is at most one problem in which they received the same score. Find the maximum number of competitors in this competition.","output":"1. **Identifying the total number of possible scores:**    Each competitor's score for each problem is an integer between 0 and 7, inclusive. Therefore, for the first two problems, the number of distinct score combinations can be calculated as:    [    8 times 8 = 64    ] 2. **Maximizing the number of competitors:**    We know that each competitor must have a unique combination of scores for the first two problems. Since there are 64 unique score combinations for the first two problems, this suggests that the maximum number of competitors ( N ) can be:    [    N leq 64    ] 3. **Constructing a valid distribution of scores:**    To verify that it is possible to have 64 competitors with the required conditions, we need to construct an example. We use a table to distribute the scores for the first two problems in a way where no two competitors have identical scores on more than one problem.    Let's define a table for score distribution:    - Rows represent scores on the first problem.    - Columns represent scores on the second problem.    - The cell at row ( i ) and column ( j ) contains the score for the third problem.

This guarantees no two competitors have the same score on two problems. For example:    - Competitor with first problem score 2 and second problem score 5 receives 7 on the third problem. 4. **Validity of construction:**    By construction, any two competitors have distinct combinations of scores across the three problems:    - No two competitors share the same score in both the first and second problems because each combination ( (i, j) ) with ( i, j in {0, 1, ..., 7} ) is unique.    - The third problem’s score is assigned uniquely by the table setup. 5. **Alternative construction method:**    Another method would be: for each pair of scores ( (p_1, p_2) ) on the first two problems, choose ( p_3 ) for the third problem so that:    [    p_1 + p_2 + p_3 equiv 0 pmod{8}    ]    This means ( p_3 = (8 - (p_1 + p_2) mod 8) mod 8 ).

Since f(x) is an increasing function on [0,1] and a decreasing function on (-infty, 0) and (1, +infty), the derivative f'(x) must be zero at x=0 and x=1, that is f'(0) = 0 and f'(1) = 0. Therefore, we have the following system of equations:  begin{align} 3a(0)^2 + 2b(0) + c &= 0  3a(1)^2 + 2b(1) + c &= 0. end{align}  From f'(0) = c = 0, we know that c = 0. Now, consider f'(1) = 3a + 2b + c = 0 with c known to be 0. This simplifies to 3a + 2b = 0. There is one more condition that we can use. Since f(x) is decreasing for x > 1, the leading coefficient a must be negative. This implies a < 0. Without further information, we cannot determine the exact values of a and b. However, we can assert that f'(x) = 3ax^2 - (3a)x = 3ax(x - 1). As f(x) is decreasing for x < 0 and x > 1, it means f'(x) must change signs from positive to negative as it passes through x = 0 and x = 1. This can happen if a is negative.

Then, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality becomes:        left( sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i cdot 1 right)^2 leq left( sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2 right) left( sum_{i=1}^{n} 1^2 right)     3. **Simplifying the Terms:**    Note that:        sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i cdot 1 = sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i             and        sum_{i=1}^{n} 1^2 = sum_{i=1}^{n} 1 = n        Therefore, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality now reads:        left( sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i right)^2 leq left( sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2 right) cdot n     4. **Taking the Square Root on Both Sides:**    To isolate the expression involving sums of (a_i), we take the square root of both sides:        left| sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i right| leq sqrt{n} sqrt{sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2}        Since we are dealing with real numbers, and assuming (a_i) can be either positive or negative, we consider the positive root for simplicity:        sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i leq sqrt{n} sqrt{sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2}     5. **Dividing Both Sides by (n):**    To further manipulate and arrive at the desired form, divide both sides of the inequality by (n):        frac{sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i}{n} leq frac{sqrt{n} sqrt{sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2}}{n}     6. **Simplifying the Right-Hand Side:**    The right-hand side simplifies naturally:        frac{sqrt{n} sqrt{sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2}}{n} = sqrt{frac{sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2}{n}}     7. **Conclusion:**    Thus, we have shown that:        frac{sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i}{n} leq sqrt{frac{sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2}{n}}        Which is equivalent to the initially given inequality:        sqrt{frac{sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2}{n}} geq frac{sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i}{n}     Therefore, the given inequality is verified.

We'll denote the leg that's rotated as ( x ) and the other leg as ( y ).  Firstly, by the Pythagorean theorem: [ c^2 = x^2 + y^2 implies x = sqrt{c^2 - y^2} ] In this scenario: - ( x ) becomes the height of the cone formed, and - ( y ) becomes the radius of the cone's base.

Method:** A full solution involves systematically identifying three-digit numbers ending with two equal digits that are divisible by 7 and verifying that the sum of their digits is also divisible by 7. This method is efficient if done systematically to save work compared to random selection. To identify the numbers: - We will break the number into the sum of its hundreds digit and a two-digit number with equal digits. - The remainders of these parts when divided by 7, either must both be 0, or their sum must be 7.   (e.g., for (322 = 7 cdot 46), 300 has a remainder of 6 and 22 has a remainder of 1). Let's compile numbers with equal digits and their division remainders: - **Remainder 0:** (00, 77), **Hundreds digit remainder 0**: 700. Thus, valid numbers: 700, 777. - **Remainder 1:** (22, 99), **Hundreds digit remainder 6**: 300. Thus, valid numbers: 322, 399. - **Remainder 2:** (44), **Hundreds digit remainder 5**: 600. Thus, valid number: 644. - **Remainder 3:** (66), **Hundreds digit remainder 4**: 200, 900. Thus, valid numbers: 266, 966. - **Remainder 4:** (11, 88), **Hundreds digit remainder 3**: 500.

Denote these decimal parts as a_i, expressed as:     [     a_{i} = i x - lfloor i x rfloor     ]     where lfloor cdot rfloor denotes the floor function. 2. **Properties of Decimal Parts (a_i)**: Each a_i for i in {0, 1, ldots, n} lies within the interval (0, 1) since x is irrational and hence i x cannot be an integer. Thus, we have:     [     0 < a_i < 1      ] 3. **Dividing the Interval**: Now, we divide the interval [0, 1] into n subintervals I_k = left[frac{k-1}{n}, frac{k}{n}right) for k in {1, 2, ldots, n}. 4. **Pigeonhole Principle Application**: According to the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least two of the a_i values falling into the same subinterval I_k since there are n+1 decimal parts a_i but only n subintervals. Thus, there exist indices i and j with i neq j such that both a_i and a_j are in the same subinterval I_k. 5. **Constructing Fraction**: By letting q = |i-j|, we construct the fraction frac{p}{q} where p = lfloor q x rfloor. This setup ensures that q is a positive integer. 6. **Evaluating the Approximation**: Since a_i and a_j are within the same subinterval, the difference |a_i - a_j| is less than the length of the subinterval:     [     |a_i - a_j| < frac{1}{n}     ] 7. **Bounding the Approximation Error**: Now, we evaluate the approximation error |x - frac{p}{q}|. Using the definition of a_i and the fact that q x = ix - jx:     [     q x = (i-j)x implies q x = ix - jx + (lfloor j x rfloor - lfloor i x rfloor) = n + m - (m+n) = 0      ]     We now approximate the rational part and rewrite as      [     p = lfloor q x rfloor      ]     This gives     [     |x - frac{p}{q}| = frac{1}{q} |q x - p|     ] 8. **Simplifying the Bound**: Using the fact that the decimal parts' difference is smaller than frac{1}{n} and substituting:     [     |x - frac{p}{q}| < frac{1}{q} cdot frac{1}{n} = frac{1}{qn}      ] 9. **Conclusion**: Since we can choose n as large as we like, we can make frac{1}{n} arbitrarily small. More importantly, we notice the bound:     [     left|x - frac{p}{q}right| < frac{1}{q^2}     ]     This indicates that for any large q, there exist fractions frac{p}{q} such that the given inequality holds, guaranteeing infinitely many such fractions.

Context: Tuberculosis is classified as one of the granulomatous inflammatory diseases. Macrophages, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and fibroblasts aggregate to form granulomas, with lymphocytes surrounding the infected macrophages. When other macrophages attack the infected macrophage, they fuse together to form a giant multinucleated cell in the alveolar lumen. The granuloma may prevent dissemination of the mycobacteria and provide a local environment for interaction of cells of the immune system. However, more recent evidence suggests that the bacteria use the granulomas to avoid destruction by the host's immune system. Macrophages and dendritic cells in the granulomas are unable to present antigen to lymphocytes; thus the immune response is suppressed. Bacteria inside the granuloma can become dormant, resulting in latent infection. Another feature of the granulomas is the development of abnormal cell death (necrosis) in the center of tubercles. To the naked eye, this has the texture of soft, white cheese and is termed caseous necrosis.; Question: What is the texture of cheese called?; Answer","output":"The texture of cheese-like substance found in the center of tubercles is called caseous necrosis."},{"instruction":"Frank was upset with Tom because the toaster he had sold him didn't work.

They are studying bacteria: Bob studies nitrogen fixating bacteria, while Andy studies nonrespiratory and facultative anaerobes. Which researcher learned more about denitrification? Hint: In many ways, bacterial metabolism provides traits that are useful for ecological stability and for human society. One example is that some bacteria have the ability to fix nitrogen gas using the enzyme nitrogenase. This environmentally important trait can be found in bacteria of most metabolic types listed above. This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively. Bacterial metabolic processes are also important in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfatereducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Nonrespiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic byproducts (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste. Facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves.","output":"Based on the information provided, it is not possible to determine which researcher learned more about denitrification as neither Bob nor Andy study denitrification specifically."},{"instruction":"They might be old enough to be your grandpa and grandma, collect their pensions and have long sinced retired, but these men and women are also building their bodies in the most remarkable ways.

But a lot of the damage is caused by storm surge. Storm surge is very high water located in the low pressure eye of the hurricane. The very low pressure of the eye allows the water level to rise above normal sea level. Storm surge can cause flooding when it reaches land ( Figure below ). High winds do a great deal of damage in hurricanes. High winds can also create very big waves. If the large waves are atop a storm surge, the high water can flood the shore. If the storm happens to occur at high tide, the water will rise even higher. Paragraph: Two cities were located 50 miles away from each other. They received a hurricane warning.

Barroso pointed out that Turkey's road to EU accession has been a long and complicated one, and it still has a lot of work to do before it can become a member. One of the biggest issues that Turkey has faced in its bid to join the EU is human rights. The country has been criticized by many for its treatment of minorities, the suppression of freedom of speech, and the use of excessive force by the police. These are all areas where Turkey needs to make significant improvements if it wants to be accepted as a member of the EU. Another challenge that Turkey faces is that it has a long-standing dispute with Greece over territorial waters, which has yet to be resolved. Turkey has also been involved in territorial disputes with Cyprus, which has complicated its relationship with the EU. Barroso's statement comes at a time when the EU is facing significant challenges of its own. Brexit, the refugee crisis, and rising populism have all put a strain on the bloc's unity and have made the prospect of Turkish membership even more remote. Despite the challenges, Turkey has made some progress on meeting the EU's requirements, such as reforming its judiciary and revising its anti-terrorism laws. However, there is still a lot of work to be done, and it remains to be seen if Turkey will ever be able to meet the high standards set by the EU. In conclusion, Barroso's reaffirmation that Turkey has not met the requirements to join the EU highlights the ongoing challenges that the country faces. While there has been some progress, Turkey still needs to make significant improvements in areas such as human rights and territorial disputes. Whether or not Turkey will ever become an EU member remains a contentious issue, but for the time being, it is clear that it still has a long way to go."},{"instruction":"Republic of China Air Force Academy Republic of China Air Force Academy (CAFA; Chinese: 中華民國空軍官校; pinyin: Zhōnghuá Mínguó Kōngjūn Guānxiào) is the military academy for the air force of Taiwan.

Changing the plate area and the separation between the plates while maintaining the same volume causes no change of the maximum amount of energy that the capacitor can store, so long as the distance between plates remains much smaller than both the length and width of the plates. In addition, these equations assume that the electric field is entirely concentrated in the dielectric between the plates. In reality there are fringing fields outside the dielectric, for example between the sides of the capacitor plates, which will increase the effective capacitance of the capacitor. This is sometimes called parasitic capacitance. For some simple capacitor geometries this additional capacitance term can be calculated analytically.

The nucleoid contains the chromosome with its associated proteins and RNA. The phylum Planctomycetes and candidate phylum Poribacteria may be exceptions to the general absence of internal membranes in bacteria, because they appear to have a double membrane around their nucleoids and contain other membranebound cellular structures. Like all living organisms, bacteria contain ribosomes, often grouped in chains called polyribosomes, for the production of proteins, but the structure of the bacterial ribosome is different from that of eukaryotes and Archaea. Bacterial ribosomes have a sedimentation rate of 70S (measured in Svedberg units): their subunits have rates of 30S and 50S.

John is an amateur astronomer. He recently found two stars, star A and star B. Upon observation, he figured out that star A is a blue star, but star B is a red giant. He had to do some research to find out the differences between them. Hint: As a star begins to run low on hydrogen, since the initial quantity has been fused into the denser helium gas, the core will contract due to gravity. The collapsing core increases temperature to the point that the star can begin to fuse helium into carbon. When that happens, the outer portion of the star expands greatly due to the higher temperature. The star can expand to 1000 times the diameter of the sun. At this point, the star is called a red giant . If our sun became a red giant, its surface would expand out past the orbit of Mars.

He was amazed by the beauty of Namib Desert, which is located mostly in Namibia. He kind of enjoyed the hot surface of the desert. Next to Namib desert is the grasslands of Botswana. He noticed that the surface temperature was much lower there. Hint: Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. A hot surface warms the air above it causing it to expand and lower the density and the resulting surface air pressure. The resulting horizontal pressure gradient moves the air from higher to lower pressure regions, creating a wind, and the Earth's rotation then causes deflection of this air flow due to the Coriolis effect. The simple systems thus formed can then display emergent behaviour to produce more complex systems and thus other weather phenomena.
