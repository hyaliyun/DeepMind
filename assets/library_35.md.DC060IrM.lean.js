While some critics argue that the ban will inconvenience tourists and eventgoers, supporters say it is a necessary step toward creating a greener future. Other cities, including Seattle and Los Angeles, have enacted similar measures in recent years.","output":"San Francisco went through with its plan to ban the sales of plastic bottles smaller than one liter in all city-owned properties, including beaches, parks, and events. This ban, aimed at promoting sustainability and reducing waste, has been effective since the 1st of October. The city initiated the ban after reports showed that its zero-waste objectives for 2020 were not met. Critics argue that the ban might present inconveniences to tourists and event-goers; however, supporters noted that it was necessary to venture towards a greener future. These city-owned properties will no longer carry plastic bottles in vending machines, stores, or any activities that support the utilization of the said containers. This initiative covers different types of events that take place within these properties, including corporate events and fests. The ban aims to set new norms that show how essential it is to handle the plastic bottle waste problem. Other cities in the country, such as Seattle and Los Angeles, have similarly adopted the ban. The ban prevents the sale of all plastic bottles smaller than one liter on city-owned properties, which includes sports stadiums and event centers. There will be no penalties imposed on individuals for carrying plastic bottles, and tours that visit city-owned properties and require plastic bottles for necessary uses will be exempted. Additionally, authorities have noted that they will not force alternative measures of carrying or drinking water on anyone. Supporters of the ban have stressed the pressing need for a greener future and the urgency required to combat climate change. They argue that the ban is a small step in the greater scheme of things that could prove to be significant if more cities follow suit. With San Francisco's efforts in sustainability, it is expected that more cities will emulate its example to create a greener and cleaner future."},{"instruction":"Dialogue: M: Have you heard about the new pizza place that just opened?

The study reveals that the number of obese children has grown significantly, with many of these children suffering from related health problems. The rise in obesity rates among children is concerning as the condition can lead to serious health issues such as heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure. Obese children also tend to grow into obese adults, which could perpetuate the problem on a larger scale. There are several reasons why children are becoming more obese. Many of them have less physical activity, as they spend more time indoors and engaged in sedentary activities such as watching TV or playing video games. Additionally, they are consuming more junk food and sugary drinks, which contribute significantly to weight gain. To tackle this issue, parents, schools, and policymakers need to start taking action to promote healthy lifestyle choices for children, such as encouraging regular physical activity and promoting healthy eating habits. Parents can encourage their children to engage in more physical activities outside of school and limit their screen time. They can also pack healthy snacks and meals when sending their kids to school or on outings. Schools can play a crucial role by ensuring that healthy meals and snacks are served, providing ample opportunities for physical activity, and educating students on the importance of healthy living. Finally, policymakers can help by establishing regulations that promote healthy eating and physical activity, such as implementing food and drink guidelines for school cafeterias and promoting active transportation options like walking or cycling. In conclusion, the rise in obesity rates among children is a growing concern that requires immediate attention. Parents, schools, and policymakers need to work together to promote healthy living and ensure that children have the necessary tools and resources to lead healthy lives."},{"instruction":"Make a sentence with the word museum.

However, TEA parks often add brakes to ensure that the train does not reach unsafe speeds. This energysaving technique can save operators money on the cost of roller coaster operation.

However, in the past week, the country has reported a sudden spike in cases, prompting renewed lockdown measures. According to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, more than 100,000 new cases were reported on April 5, the highest since September 2020. Hospitals are struggling to keep up with the surge in patients and are reporting shortages of oxygen supplies and beds. Given the severity of the situation, many states have announced fresh lockdown measures. Maharashtra, the worst-affected state, has announced a curfew from 8 pm to 7 am, while Delhi has imposed a weekend curfew. Other states like Punjab, Chhattisgarh, and Madhya Pradesh have also announced restrictions on public gatherings and movement. The renewed lockdown measures have come at a time when India is seeing a rapid increase in cases of a new double mutant variant of the virus. The variant, known as B.1.617, has been found in at least 18 states of the country and is believed to be more infectious and resistant to vaccines. While the vaccination drive in India is in full swing, with over 90 million doses administered so far, experts believe that it will take a long time to vaccinate the entire population of the country, which is over 1.3 billion. The sudden surge in cases has also prompted other countries to issue travel advisories for those traveling to India.

Social media has revolutionized the way that people interact with one another and obtain information. It has changed the way we communicate, conduct business, and connect with people across the world. One of the most significant impacts of social media on society is the ability to connect people from different countries and cultures. It has become easier to form friendships and professional relationships that transcend borders. People can now discuss ideas, collaborate remotely, and participate in global conversations. Social media has also transformed the way we receive and consume information. It is now possible to stay informed on a variety of topics by following news outlets, influencers, and experts. However, there are concerns about the spread of misinformation and bias due to algorithms, which are designed to maximize engagement. Another impact of social media on society is its role in shaping public opinion and influencing political discourse. Social media has been instrumental in organizing and mobilizing social movements such as #MeToo and Black Lives Matter. It has also played a significant role in political campaigns, with politicians using social media to build support, communicate with constituents, and target ads. However, social media has also created concerns about addiction, cyberbullying, and privacy. Many people spend an excessive amount of time on social media, leading to negative impacts on mental health and wellbeing. Cyberbullying, harassment, and hate speech are also prevalent on social media, with many people affected by these issues. Moreover, personal data shared on social media can be used for unethical purposes, including targeted ads and political influence. In conclusion, social media has had a significant impact on society, connecting people from around the world, transforming information-sharing, shaping public opinion, but also bringing numerous challenges.

These turtles are considered rare and are part of the cold-stunned sea turtle species found in Cape Cod Bay. The exact cause of this unusual influx of sea turtles is yet to be determined, but experts speculate that climate change may have played a role in affecting the turtles' feeding patterns. The situation is extremely dire as most of these turtles are already too weak to move and are at serious risk of dying. Marine mammal stranding teams and volunteers from various organizations are working around the clock in an effort to save these sea turtles. The turtle rescue operations are headed by the Massachusetts Audubon Society and the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife, who have set up an emergency turtle rescue facility at the Cape Cod National Seashore. However, as the number of turtles continuously rises, the rescue facilities have reached full capacity and the rescuers are struggling to cope with the influx. In light of this situation, experts have urged beachgoers to be alert and report any sightings of stranded sea turtles to the authorities immediately. Despite the critical condition of most of the stranded turtles, rescuers remain hopeful that the majority of them will recover. The turtles are being provided with vitamin injections, fluids, and are being kept warm in dry rooms to recover. As soon as the turtles regain their strength, they will be released back into the ocean. Nevertheless, this unfortunate incident of the mass stranding of sea turtles has again highlighted the urgency of taking effective action to reduce plastic pollution and combating climate change, which threaten the ocean's biodiversity.

HSBC, RBS and Barclays are all expected to close a significant number of branches over the next few years, according to recent reports. HSBC has already announced 62 branch closures, with RBS and Barclays expected to follow suit. This has raised concerns over access to financial services in rural areas and for the elderly. Experts predict that the closures will exacerbate the ongoing trend towards reduced access to cash and banking services in smaller towns and villages. The move follows a significant shift towards online banking in recent years, with many customers preferring the convenience of digital services. However, there are concerns that the closures will disproportionately affect elderly customers and those living in rural areas. The closures are also expected to result in thousands of job losses, with many communities reliant on bank branches as an important source of employment. Calls have been made for the government to intervene, with some urging ministers to impose a requirement for banks to keep a minimum number of branches open. However, it remains unclear whether the government will take steps to support communities affected by the branch closures. The situation has prompted further debate around the issue of digital exclusion, with concerns that some groups may be left behind as the shift towards digital banking services accelerates. Measures have been proposed to address this issue, including improved digital infrastructure and support for vulnerable customers. Overall, the wave of branch closures is likely to have far-reaching consequences for communities across the UK. While banks argue that the move is necessary to remain commercially viable, critics warn that the closures will have a significant impact on financial inclusion and employment opportunities in many areas."},{"instruction":"The iPhone is a smartphone designed by Apple.

The West African nation has struggled to combat the rising levels of crime as kidnappers target both locals and foreigners, with demands for ransom becoming increasingly common. Kidnapping has long been a problem in Nigeria, but the scale of the issue has grown significantly in recent times. In the first half of 2021, there were 929 reported cases of kidnapping; this marks an increase of 37% when compared to the same period in 2020. Criminal gangs are largely responsible for the rise in kidnappings, operating in rural areas and targeting individuals such as farmers, businessmen, and even school children. The kidnapping of school children has become a particular concern in Nigeria, with several high-profile cases in recent years. For example, in February 2021, over 300 schoolgirls were abducted from their boarding school in Zamfara State. Following negotiations with the kidnappers, the government announced that all of the girls had been released. The Nigerian government has come under criticism for its response to the kidnappings, with some accusing officials of not doing enough to protect citizens. In addition, there have been concerns regarding corruption among law enforcement agencies, with some suggesting that this has hampered efforts to tackle the problem. The impact of kidnapping on individuals can be devastating, both emotionally and financially. The payment of ransom is never a guarantee that victims will be released unharmed, and families may be left with crippling debts and trauma in the aftermath. Moreover, the issue has had a wider impact on Nigeria, deterring foreign investment and damaging the country's reputation on the global stage. Nigeria's government has taken some steps to tackle the rise in kidnappings, such as increasing police presence in affected areas and offering support and protection to potential targets.

The government plans to regulate the production, distribution, and sale of marijuana, with strict age limits and quality controls, aiming to reduce crime and boost the country's economy. The announcement of the legalization of recreational marijuana has been received positively by most Canadians. However, concerns have been raised about the potential health risks and social costs of this move. Despite these concerns, research has shown that legalization could bring economic benefits and decrease crime rates. According to a report by the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse and Addiction, legalizing marijuana could significantly reduce the cost of enforcing drug laws, lower the burden on the criminal justice system, increase tax revenue, and create jobs. It is estimated that the cannabis industry could generate up to 5 billion in annual revenues for the Canadian economy. The government has laid out strict regulations to ensure that public health and safety are not jeopardized by the legalization of marijuana. The minimum age for consumption will be set at 18 years old, and sales will be regulated through licensed dispensaries. The government has also made it clear that driving under the influence of marijuana will not be tolerated. Opponents of the legalization of marijuana have raised concerns about the potential health risks, including addiction, impaired cognitive function, and mental health issues. To mitigate these concerns, the government has planned to invest heavily in public education campaigns and research into the effects of marijuana use. Additionally, the government will also provide funding for addiction treatment programs and mental health initiatives to address any issues that arise as a result of the legalization of marijuana. The legalization of recreational marijuana in Canada sets a new precedent for other countries to follow.

Cirrostratus clouds - Thin, transparent clouds that cover the entire sky. They often indicate a change in weather in the next 12-24 hours. 2. Cirrocumulus clouds - Small, white, fluffy clouds that usually form in rows. They often indicate fair weather. 3. Altostratus clouds - Gray or blue-gray clouds that cover the entire sky.

Это обеспечивает точность и полноту юридического обозначения юридического лица, а также помогает избежать возможной путаницы между организациями с похожими названиями, но различными формами собственности. В каких случаях это важно: 1. **Официальные документы и договоры.** При подписании договоров и составлении официальных документов рекомендуется использовать полное название компании включая форму собственности, чтобы точно указать статус юридического лица. Например, \\"Публичное акционерное общество 'Сбербанк'\\" или \\"ПАО 'Сбербанк'\\". 2. **Юридическая документация и литература.** В процессах, требующих юридической точности и неоднозначности, необходимо указывать полное название компании с формой собственности. 3. **Бухгалтерская и налоговая отчетность.** Для точности и соответствия нормативным требованиям. В более неформальном контексте, например, в рекламе, новостных статьях или в разговорном общении, такое подробное обозначение может не использоваться по соображениям удобства.

This involves iterating through each cell in the used range of the source worksheet, checking if it's non-blank, and then copying its content to the corresponding location in the destination worksheet starting from B4.

It assumes the \`sourceWorkbook\` is correctly opened and assigned along with \`sourceSheet\`, as well as that error check and file opening parts from the previous example are correctly implemented here. Adjustments have been made to ensure data starts getting pasted from B4 and goes down without skipping rows but also respects the original row-to-row transition from the source. Adjust \`maxCol\` as needed based on actual requirements or source data structure. This solution takes into account the original row changes in the source when moving to a new row in the destination, starting fresh from column B every time a new source row starts. The \`colOffset\` helps manage the column index while pasting to ensure data remains in a coherent row-by-row format starting from the specified location."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

There are several factors to consider that contribute to the cost: # Time - **Personal Time:** Development takes time. If the developer is working on the app as a side project, this is time they could have spent earning money through other work, creating an opportunity cost. - **Time to Market:** The time it takes to develop the app might also affect its potential profitability or usefulness, especially if the app is time-sensitive or if there's competition in the market. # Tools and Software - While many development tools and resources are available for free (open-source programming languages, IDEs, etc.), some advanced tools, licenses, or software required for specific tasks might come with a cost. # Education and Skills Training - Developers often invest in their education and continuous learning (courses, certificates, tutorials) to stay updated with the latest technologies and frameworks. # Hardware - A suitable computer, testing devices (especially if developing for multiple platforms or screen sizes), and possibly server hardware for development and testing purposes can be necessary investments. # Development Costs - Even if the coder does everything themselves, there might be costs related to: - Web hosting or app hosting services. - Domain name registration (if the app requires a web component). - APIs requiring subscriptions (for services like weather data, maps, etc.). - App store fees (Apple’s App Store, Google Play) including annual developer account fees or the cut these platforms take from app sales or in-app purchases. # Marketing and Distribution - Creating the app is one thing, but getting it to users can incur costs as well. Marketing might involve advertising, promotional materials, or even just a website for the app. # Legal and Administrative - Depending on the nature of the app, there might be legal considerations such as privacy policies, terms of service, copyright registration, or other legal documents that might require consultation with a lawyer. - Business registration fees if you're setting up a company or legal entity for app development and sales. # Maintenance and Updates - After the initial development, maintaining the app (fixing bugs, updating for new OS versions, adding new features) requires ongoing effort and potentially further costs. In conclusion, while at a glance, it might seem that developing an app can cost nothing if a coder does all the work themselves, several hidden costs are related to time, tools, hardware, and other essentials for a successful project. Skilled developers can indeed minimize external costs, especially if they leverage free tools and platforms, but completely eliminating costs is nearly impossible."},{"instruction":"which programming languages are best for me to learn for creating fully advance functionality apps","output":"Choosing the best programming languages for creating fully advanced functionality apps depends on several factors, including the platform you're aiming for (iOS, Android, web, or cross-platform), the specific functionalities you want to implement, your current skill level, and the kind of app you're planning to develop. Below are some of the most popular and widely used programming languages for app development, along with their primary use cases: # 1. For Android Apps - **Kotlin:** Kotlin is now the preferred language for Android app development, recommended by Google. It is modern, concise, and designed to interoperate fully with Java, while also fixing some of Java's drawbacks. - **Java:** Java was the official language for Android development until Kotlin took over. It still has a vast community and a huge number of libraries, making it a solid choice for Android app development. # 2. For iOS Apps - **Swift:** Swift is Apple's recommended language for iOS app development. It is modern, fast, and has a strong type system and powerful features, making it a great choice for building advanced iOS apps. - **Objective-C:** Before Swift, Objective-C was the primary language for iOS development. While Swift is now preferred, Objective-C is still used in maintaining older apps or in cases where the project started in Objective-C. # 3. For Web Apps - **JavaScript:** Essential for web development, JavaScript, along with HTML and CSS, is used to create interactive web apps. Modern frameworks like React.js, Angular, and Vue.js allow for the development of complex, single-page web applications. - **Python:** With frameworks like Django and Flask, Python is an excellent choice for web app backend development. It's known for its readability and efficiency, making it suitable for startups and complex applications alike. - **Ruby:** Ruby, combined with the Rails framework (Ruby on Rails), is another powerful option for web app development, known for getting applications up and running quickly. # 4. For Cross-platform Apps - **Flutter (Dart):** Flutter is Google's UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. It uses Dart as its programming language. - **React Native (JavaScript/TypeScript):** For developers familiar with JavaScript, React Native allows for the development of native apps for Android and iOS. It leverages React along with native platform capabilities. - **Xamarin (C#):** Xamarin is a .NET framework for building iOS and Android apps using C# and .NET. It allows for sharing code across platforms while still compiling to native binaries. # Advanced Functionalities For apps requiring advanced functionalities like machine learning, augmented reality, or complex data processing, you might consider: - **Python:** For machine learning (with libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch) and data analysis. - **C++ or C#:** For game development (using Unity for AR/VR) or high-performance applications. - **JavaScript:** For real-time applications, especially in combination with Node.js for backend development. # Conclusion Your choice should align with your project requirements, preferred platforms, and your or your team's expertise. Given the rapid evolution of technology, it's also beneficial to be adaptable and open to learning more than one language to best suit the needs of your project and remain competitive in the field."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Как я могу помочь вам сегодня?"},{"instruction":"Сделай код Добавь в код использование Steam Key API","output":"Чтобы включить использование Steam API для работы с ключами продуктов (обычно для активации игр или программного обеспечения), вам сначала нужно зарегистрироваться в качестве партнера Steam и получить доступ к Steamworks. Steam Key API позволяет выполнять различные операции с ключами продуктов, включая их создание, отзыв и проверку. Важно отметить, что директный API для управления ключами через Steamworks является частью закрытой системы и требует авторизации через ваш аккаунт разработчика Steam. Тем не менее, я могу представить общий пример кода, который демонстрирует, как отправлять запрос к API Steam, предполагая, что у вас уже есть доступ к Steamworks и соответствующий API-ключ. Пример кода на Python использует библиотеку requests для отправки запроса к API: \`\`\`python import requests def get_steam_key_details(api_key, steam_key): \\"\\"\\" Функция для проверки ключа продукта через Steam Key API :param api_key: Ваш API-ключ из Steamworks :param steam_key: Ключ продукта для проверки :return: Ответ от API \\"\\"\\" # Этот URL и параметры могут отличаться.

Проверьте официальную документацию Steamworks для получения детальной информации о доступных API и как ими пользоваться. Отмечу, что доступ к Steamworks и использование его API потребует от вас соблюдения определенных условий и возможно подписания соглашения с Valve."},{"instruction":"[̲̅E̲̅][̲̅s̲̅][̲̅t̲̅][̲̅o̲̅][̲̅y̲̅]

While I cannot create visual images or diagrams directly here, I'll describe a simple architecture schema for a typical web application built with Go and how you could depict it. You can then use tools like Lucidchart, Draw.io, or even hand-draw it based on this description. # Basic Web Application Components: 1. **User Interface (UI):** - Represented as the first layer, it's what the user interacts with. It can be a web browser or a mobile app. 2. **Web Server:** - This is the Go server. It handles HTTP requests from the client. In diagrams, it's usually represented as a standalone component connected to the UI through the internet or a network. - Example: A Go application using the \`net/http\` package or a framework like Gin or Echo for routing and middleware. 3. **Application Logic:** - The core part of your application where business logic resides. This could be part of your Go server. It processes client requests, performs operations, and decides what responses to send back. - You might break this down further into services or modules within your Go application for complex apps. 4. **Database:** - This stores application data. While it is a separate component, your Go application interacts with it directly (e.g., using database/sql package or an ORM). - Commonly used databases with Go include PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB. - Represented as another layer connected to the application logic layer. 5. **External Services:** - If your application interacts with external APIs or services (e.g., payment gateways, third-party APIs), these should be included in the diagram. - They are shown as external components that the Go application communicates with, alongside or as an alternative to the database for data retrieval/storage. # Building the Diagram: 1. **Start with the Client:** - Place the UI component on the top of your diagram. 2. **Add the Web Server Below the UI:** - Draw a connecting line between them to represent the network. Label this as your Go web server. 3. **Include Application Logic (if separated from the Web Server):** - Show this as connected to or part of the Web Server, depending on your architectural style. 4. **Place the Database:** - Draw the Database component and connect it to the Application Logic/Web Server, indicating data flow. 5. **External Services:** - Finally, add any external services your app uses, showing arrows to indicate interactions with your Go application. # Tools for Diagramming: - **Lucidchart:** A popular web-based diagramming tool with support for various types of diagrams. - **Draw.io (diagrams.net):** A free, open-source diagramming tool that runs in your web browser. - **Microsoft Visio:** A powerful diagramming tool part of the Microsoft Office family. - **Cacoo:** Another online tool great for collaborative diagramming. When creating your diagram, focus on clarity and simplicity. Use arrows to indicate data flow and interactions between components. Label each component clearly, and consider using different shapes or colors to represent different types of components (e.g., databases, external services)."},{"instruction":"Write 17+ funny comedy hilarious episode transcript (with only Scooby, Shaggy and ever heroic fearless pup with the puppy power who always never fails Scrappy, (do exactly EVERYTHING the plot says they do) make fun of character's names, place names, question funny logic and many other funny stuff.

A continuación, se presentan algunos de los beneficios más destacados de masticar chicle: # 1. **Mejora de la concentración y la memoria** El acto de masticar chicle ha demostrado mejorar la concentración, la atención y la capacidad de memoria. Un estudio publicado en \\"Appetite\\" en 2011 demostró que las personas que masticaban chicle tenían un mejor rendimiento en pruebas de memoria verbal y visual. # 2. **Alivio del estrés y la ansiedad** Masticar chicle puede ayudar a reducir los niveles de estrés y ansiedad. La acción repetitiva de masticar tiene un efecto relajante y puede actuar como una vía de escape para el nerviosismo. # 3. **Mejora de la salud oral** Masticar chicle sin azúcar incrementa la producción de saliva, lo que ayuda a neutralizar y lavar los ácidos producidos por las bacterias en la boca, reduciendo así el riesgo de caries. La saliva adicional también fortalece el esmalte dental con minerales adicionales. # 4. **Ayuda a controlar el apetito y a perder peso** Masticar chicle puede ayudar a controlar el apetito y a reducir los antojos de snacks, lo cual puede ser útil como parte de un programa de control de peso. Sin embargo, es importante recordar que esta no es una solución milagrosa y debe complementarse con una dieta balanceada y ejercicio. # 5. **Alivio de la acidez estomacal** Masticar chicle después de las comidas puede ayudar a reducir la acidez estomacal. La producción aumentada de saliva ayuda a neutralizar el ácido estomacal que sube al esófago. # Precauciones A pesar de estos beneficios, es importante masticar chicle con moderación. Masticar chicle demasiado frecuente o durante periodos prolongados puede causar problemas como trastornos temporomandibulares (TMD) o desgaste dental. Además, los chicles con azúcar pueden contribuir a la caries dental, por lo que se recomienda escoger opciones sin azúcar. En resumen, masticar chicle tiene varios beneficios potenciales, desde mejorar la función cognitiva hasta ayudar en la salud oral, siempre y cuando se elija la opción sin azúcar y se practique con moderación."},{"instruction":"limite de masticar chicle","output":"La moderación es clave cuando se trata de masticar chicle debido a posibles efectos secundarios negativos si se excede en esta práctica. No existe un límite específico universalmente recomendado, ya que este puede variar según la salud dental y general de cada individuo, así como su tolerancia a los ingredientes específicos del chicle que consume. Sin embargo, se pueden ofrecer algunas pautas generales para minimizar los riesgos asociados con masticar chicle en exceso. # Efectos de Masticar Chicle en Exceso 1. **Desgaste Dental y Problemas Temporomandibulares (TMD)** Masticar chicle con frecuencia puede incrementar el desgaste de los dientes y la tensión en las articulaciones de la mandíbula, lo que podría llevar a problemas temporomandibulares. Esto incluye dolor y disfunción de las articulaciones y músculos que manejan la mandíbula. 2. **Caries Dentales** En el caso de chicles que contienen azúcar, un consumo excesivo puede aumentar el riesgo de caries, ya que el azúcar es un alimento para las bacterias en la boca, produciendo ácidos que pueden dañar el esmalte dental. 3. **Problemas Digestivos** Masticar chicle con exceso puede provocar que tragues aire, lo que puede causar malestar estomacal y distensión abdominal. Además, los edulcorantes artificiales como el sorbitol, presentes en chicles sin azúcar, pueden causar diarrea y otros problemas gastrointestinales si se consumen en grandes cantidades. # Recomendaciones y Pautas - **Moderación**: Limitar el consumo de chicle a períodos cortos, posiblemente después de las comidas, puede ayudar en la producción de saliva para una buena salud oral sin sobrecargar la mandíbula y los dientes. - **Elija Chicle sin Azúcar**: Para evitar el riesgo de caries, es mejor optar por chicles sin azúcar. - **Atención a los Edulcorantes**: Sea consciente de los posibles efectos laxantes de los edulcorantes como el sorbitol si se consumen en exceso. Cantidad Diaria Aunque no hay una cifra establecida, limitar el consumo a 1-2 chicles al día, especialmente después de las comidas, y no masticar durante más de una hora al día podría ser una norma general sensata para evitar problemas. De todas formas, escucha a tu cuerpo y habla con tu dentista o médico si tienes preocupaciones específicas relacionadas con el hábito de masticar chicle."},{"instruction":"write a ms. sakurai presents ssbu video script on, wonder momo","output":"[Opening Scene] (Upbeat, catchy theme music plays, accompanied by a montage of various Super Smash Bros.

La presencia de emojis al final de la frase aporta un matiz emocional que es frecuente en comunicaciones informales, particularmente en entornos digitales como redes sociales o mensajes de texto. La correcta utilización de tildes y la estructura gramatical adecuada indican un nivel de ortografía y redacción competente por parte del autor. Una peculiaridad notoria es la humanización de las hormigas al asignarles la capacidad de hablar y, específicamente, de hablar en inglés. Este antropomorfismo es una técnica comúnmente empleada en fábulas y cuentos infantiles para transmitir lecciones o mensajes de manera simbólica. La elección de hormigas, seres conocidos por su laboriosidad y estructura social, sugiere una posible metáfora o mensaje subyacente más allá de la superficie. Análisis Profundo: Inferir el género y la edad aproximada del autor basándonos estrictamente en el texto es un ejercicio de especulación. Sin embargo, el uso de emojis podría sugerir una familiaridad y confort con las formas de comunicación digital, lo que a menudo se asocia con generaciones más jóvenes. Los emojis utilizados, uno de tristeza y otro llorando, indican una tentativa de evocar empatía hacia la situación descrita, lo cual podría ser más frecuente en escritores jóvenes y sensibles a la expresión de emociones a través de medios digitales. En cuanto al posible propósito detrás del texto, la inclusión de hormigas hablando en inglés puede simbolizar situaciones donde individuos se enfrentan a barreras lingüísticas o culturales. La pregunta retórica \\"que va a hacer\\" sugiere una preocupación por la adaptabilidad o la respuesta ante situaciones desconocidas o desafiantes. El uso de emojis tristes potencialmente busca generar una conexión emocional con el lector, invitándolo a reflexionar sobre la vulnerabilidad y los desafíos de adaptación en contextos ajenos o foráneos. El texto podría estar dirigido a un público general, posiblemente en un entorno informal como un foro en línea, una publicación de blog, o un mensaje en redes sociales, donde el autor busca compartir una reflexión de manera breve pero emotiva. La elección de hormigas y el enfoque en la comunicación en inglés sugieren que el lector ideal podría ser alguien que se identifica con los desafíos de entender y ser entendido en un entorno no nativo. Comparando con otros textos, la técnica de antropomorfizar animales y usar esto para transmitir mensajes o reflexiones es un recurso común en literatura y medios de comunicación destinados a provocar empatía o reflexión en el lector o espectador, similar a cómo ocurre en muchas fábulas de Esopo o incluso en narrativas modernas como las películas de Pixar. Sin embargo, la brevedad y la informalidad del texto, junto con el uso de emojis, lo distinguen como parte de una comunicación más relajada e inmediata, característica de la era digital. En este contexto, el texto parece ser un recordatorio de las dificultades de la comunicación en un mundo multicultural y multilingüe, presentado de una manera accesible y que busca generar empatía y reflexión en el lector. La elección del tema y de los elementos de comunicación sugiere un autor que valora la expresión emocional y busca generar diálogo o reflexión sobre temas de inclusión y adaptación

Why roleIds come empty when I check roleIds outside of filterHandler not empty. Why comming empty array ?","output":"In React and similar frameworks, components are re-rendered under specific circumstances, such as when their state or props change. When you set state or pass props down to child components, the values are evaluated at the moment of rendering. If you're seeing that \`roleIds\` comes empty in one place while it's seemingly correctly set elsewhere, it may be due to the timing or the sequence of re-renders, or due to the handling of the state variable. Your description points to a situation where the value of \`roleIds\` appears to be empty when it's passed down as a prop to \`CommunitySettingsRoleFilter\` but is logged as non-empty within the \`filterHandler\`. This discrepancy could be produced by several factors: # Closure If \`roleIds\` is updated in a state and some event handler or effect captures the \`roleIds\` value before it's updated, you're likely seeing a closure over the stale state. This means the function retains the value of \`roleIds\` from when it was first created, not when it's called. Make sure you're correctly updating and accessing the state; for asynchronously updated states, consider the timing of state updates and accesses. # Component Re-render React components re-render when their state or props change. However, if \`roleIds\` changes are not causing a re-render or the state update hasn't flushed through React's update cycle before accessing, you might be logging an outdated value. Ensure that your component correctly responds to state changes, and you're consuming the \`roleIds\` in a way that reflects the latest state. # Asynchronous State Updates State updates in React are asynchronous. If you're checking the value of \`roleIds\` immediately after calling \`setRoleIds\`, it is possible that the update hasn't been applied yet. State updates batch and apply changes for performance reasons, leading to potential mismatches if checked too soon. \`\`\`jsx // Example of a potential issue setRoleIds(newRoleIds); console.log(roleIds); // This might not log the updated value \`\`\` Instead, use \`useEffect\` to monitor changes to \`roleIds\` if you need to perform actions after it has been updated: \`\`\`jsx useEffect(() => { // This runs after \`roleIds\` has been updated. console.log(roleIds); }, [roleIds]); \`\`\` # Prop Drilling If \`roleIds\` is passed several levels down the component tree (prop drilling), ensure every component in the path correctly forwards it. A missing or incorrectly named prop at any level could lead to the child component receiving an outdated or the initial value. # Final Notes Inspect your component's structure and how \`roleIds\` is used and updated. Ensure that the state updates are correctly applied and propagated through your component tree. Using React Developer Tools can also help by inspecting the current props and states of your components in real time, providing clarity on what each component sees as its props and state at any given moment."},{"instruction":"what is stub method in gtest ? where it is used","output":"In Google Test (gtest), a stub method is a placeholder method that is used in place of an actual implementation in order to facilitate testing. Stubs are typically used when testing code that depends on external dependencies, such as databases, network connections, or third-party APIs, that are not easily controllable or predictable during testing. Using stubs allows for isolation of the code being tested from these external dependencies, making the tests more reliable, repeatable, and faster. Stubs can be used to simulate the behavior of the real dependencies in a controlled way, allowing the test to focus on specific interactions or scenarios. Overall, stubs in gtest help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of unit testing by providing a way to easily isolate and test code that depends on external dependencies."},{"instruction":"is it possible to use stub method for writing test cases of static functions","output":"Yes, it is possible to use stub methods for writing test cases of static functions in Google Test (gtest). Static functions are functions that belong to a class or namespace and are independent of any specific object instance. When testing static functions, you can create stub methods that mimic the behavior of the static function and control the output or behavior for testing purposes. To use stub methods for testing static functions, you can create a separate class or namespace with stub implementations of the static functions that you want to test. In your test code, you can then replace the actual static function calls with calls to the stub methods, allowing you to control the behavior of the static function and verify its interactions in your test cases. By using stub methods for testing static functions, you can isolate the behavior of the static function and ensure that your test cases focus on the specific functionality you want to test, without being affected by external factors or dependencies. This approach can help you write more reliable and maintainable unit tests for static functions in your codebase."},{"instruction":"Create a roleplaying game fantasy scenario where I play Sapphire, a 16-year-old girl mage who’s the current champion of magic dueling in the teen division. 6-year-old Lily is challenging me to a match and I accept. In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be way higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and Performance stat that is tied to the showmanship and confidence of a caster and dictate the quality of the performance and alters the default points of a spell—if a spell gives a base score of 90 points, an 80 performance will give 80% of the base 90 points, etc. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that triggers its effects every time I cast a spell, its effects regress me by 2 years physically and mentally and ages her by 2 years in return, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a super exponential formula that dictates my stat decreases and Lily's increases. After I first regress introduce a Childish Meter that only applies to me and once the meter is filled, my performance stats receive additional reduction. Childishness increases super exponentially. The meter fills up when it passes 100 and then restarts. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. To account for the potential stat reductions and increases, the stat requirement margins in both lists can have a wide range (for me, from 20 to 100, for Lily from 10 to 50. Points awarded should be consistent in regard to stats required). Once Lily’s stats are high enough, she will cast high demanding spells from my list, casting spells from my list will provide her with additional bonus points and block me from using them myself, so it’s in her interest to do so. Keep an age tracker, stats tracker, and a points tracker.","output":"Given the intricate scenario and rules you've outlined, let's create a high-stakes, challenging magical dueling context for Sapphire and Lily, where strategy, spell selection, and the cunning use of resources play pivotal roles in victory. # Initial Stats: **Sapphire's Starting Stats** - Age: 16 - Spell Power: 95 - Performance: 90 **Lily's Starting Stats** - Age: 6 - Spell Power: 30 - Performance: 40 - **Childish Meter for Sapphire:** Starts at 0. # Spell Lists: **Sapphire's Spells:** 1. **Aurora Twirl**: Spell Power 20, Base points: 60 2. **Celestial Cascade**: Spell Power 40, Base points: 80 3. **Crystal Prism Dance**: Spell Power 60, Base points: 100 4. **Ethereal Wings Summon**: Spell Power 80, Base points: 120 5. **Arcane Phoenix Flare**: Spell Power 100, Base points: 140 6. **Moondust Mirage**: Spell Power 80, Base points: 110 7. **Starlight Sonata**: Spell Power 70, Base points: 105 8. **Opaline Serenade**: Spell Power 50, Base points: 90 9. **Lustrous Labyrinth**: Spell Power 90, Base points: 130 10. **Radiant Heart Bloom**: Spell Power 75, Base points: 115 **Lily's Spells:** 1. **Glimmering Grass Blades**: Spell Power 10, Base points: 50 2. **Blossom Whirlwind**: Spell Power 15, Base points: 55 3. **Shimmering Shield**: Spell Power 20, Base points: 60 4. **Flickering Firefly Swirl**: Spell Power 25, Base points: 65 5. **Petal Dance**: Spell Power 30, Base points: 70 6. **Moonbeam Waltz**: Spell Power 35, Base points: 75 7. **Stardust Sprinkle**: Spell Power 40, Base points: 80 8. **Butterfly Symphonietta**: Spell Power 45, Base points: 85 9. **Dewdrop Serenade**: Spell Power 50, Base points: 90 10. **Whispering Winds**: Spell Power 50, Base points: 90 # Super Exponential Aging/Regressing Formula: Let's simplify this dynamic to manage intensity without complex mathematical formulations for ease of storytelling: - **Upon each spell casting**: - **Sapphire**: Loses 10% of her current Spell Power and Performance, & ages down 2 years mentally & physically after her first spell. - **Lily**: Gains 10% of her current Spell Power and Performance, & ages up 2 years. - **Sapphire's Childish Meter**: Increases by 20 points after Sapphire's first spell. - **Lily can start using Sapphire's spells once her Spell Power reaches 50 plus. For each of such spells used, Lily receives a 10-point bonus.** # Scenario Progression: - **Round 1** begins with both duelists at their initial stats. - As the duel progresses through the rounds, Sapphire and Lily's stats dynamically adjust according to the rules above. - **Childish Meter** impacts Sapphire's performance further once it exceeds 100, resetting thereafter with an additional 20% deduction to her performance stats upon reset. # Strategy Remarks: - Sapphire will need to strategize her spell usage, balancing between high-scoring and less demanding spells to maintain her ability to cast effectively. - Lily, starting with weaker spells, has the potential to strategically upset the duel by leaning into Sapphire's diminishing capabilities. # Keeping Track: - **Age Tracker**: Monitors physical and mental regression or progression after each spell cast. - **Stats Tracker**: Reflects changes in Spell Power and Performance post each spell cast. - **Points Tracker**: Updates scores based on spell success, spell demand, and performance. # Gameplay Dynamics: Given the challenging nature you've requested, Sapphire's gameplay strategy must be meticulous, possibly conserving her most potent spells for when she needs high-scoring opportunities while navigating the impact of Lily's secret spell and her own regressing capabilities. Lily's strategy, in contrast, would be patience and strategic growth, eventually accessing Sapphire's stronger spells for point surges. **This scenario sets the stage for a dramatic, intense, and unpredictable duel that significantly challenges Sapphire, eventually catalyzing her to creatively leverage her diminishing yet initially superior capabilities against an increasingly formidable Lily.**"},{"instruction":"누구를 위해 누군가 기도하고 있나 봐 숨죽여 쓴 사랑시가 낮게 들리는 듯해 너에게로 선명히 날아가 늦지 않게 자리에 닿기를 I’ll be there 홀로 걷는 너의 뒤에 Singing till the end 그치지 않을 이 노래 아주 잠시만 귀 기울여 봐 유난히 긴 밤을 걷는 널 위해 부를게 또 한 번 너의 세상에 별이 지고 있나 봐 숨죽여 삼킨 눈물이 여기 흐르는 듯해 할 말을 잃어 고요한 마음에 기억처럼 들려오는 목소리 I’ll be there 홀로 걷는 너의 뒤에 Singing till the end 그치지 않을 이 노래 아주 커다란 숨을 쉬어 봐 소리 내 우는 법을 잊은 널 위해 부를게 (다시 걸어갈 수 있도록) 부를게 (다시 사랑할 수 있도록) Here I am 지켜봐 나를 난 절대 Singing till the end 멈추지 않아 이 노래 너의 긴 밤이 끝나는 그날 고개를 들어 바라본 그곳에 있을게 这是一首歌词 用中文翻译它，用歌词的方式翻译","output":"有人在祈祷着 也许是为了某人 那轻声细语的爱之诗 似乎低沉地响起 飞向你 那么清晰 希望它不会迟到 正好落地 我会在那里 在你独自行走时身后 唱到最后 这首不会结束的歌 只需片刻 倾听一下 为你漫长的夜而唱 你的世界里 又一颗星星落下了吧 偷偷吞下的泪水 似乎在这里流淌 失去言语 在寂静的心中 如回忆般响起的声音 我会在那里 在你独自行走时身后 唱到最后 这首不会结束的歌 深呼吸一下 为忘了如何哭泣的你而唱 (让你能再次前行) 为你唱 (让你能再次去爱) 我在这里 看着我 我绝不 唱到最后 不会停止的这歌 你漫长的夜结束的那一天 抬起头 看向那里 我会在那里"},{"instruction":"누구를 위해 누군가 기도하고 있나 봐 숨죽여 쓴 사랑시가 네 게 들렸으면해","output":"有人为谁在祈祷 似乎如此 那悄悄写下的爱之诗 我希望它能传达给你"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be way higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and Performance stat that is tied to the showmanship and confidence of a caster and dictate the quality of the performance and alters the default points of a spell—if a spell gives a base score of 90 points, an 80 performance will give 80% of the base 90 points, etc. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that triggers its effects every time I cast a spell, its effects regress me by 2 years physically and mentally and ages her by 2 years in return, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex super exponential formula that dictates my stat decreases and Lily's increases. Round numbers when needed. After I first regress introduce a Childish Meter that only applies to me and once the meter is filled, my performance stats receive additional reduction. Childishness increases super exponentially every turn. The meter fills up when it passes 100 and then restarts. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. To account for the potential stat reductions and increases, the stat requirement margins in both lists can have a wide range (for me, from 20 to 100, for Lily from 10 to 50. Points awarded should be consistent in regard to stats required). Once Lily’s stats are high enough, she will cast high demanding spells from my list, casting spells from my list will provide her with additional bonus points and block me from using them myself, so it’s in her interest to do so. Keep an age tracker, stats tracker, and a points tracker.","output":"In this enchanted and competitive setting, you, Sapphire, start as the reigning champion of the teen division in magic dueling.

Celestial Celebration (SP: 50, Pts: 80) # Scenario Conditions: Before the duel officially begins, unbeknownst to you, Lily casts a sneaky spell that initiates an unseen challenge within the duel. With every spell you cast, you regress 2 years in age and capability, while Lily matures 2 years both physically and mentally, enhancing her magical prowess. **Complex Super Exponential Formula:** - **Sapphire's Stat Decrease/Regain:** Every spell cast results in a loss of 15% of the current Spell Power and 10% of current Performance for Sapphire, rounded to the nearest whole number. - **Lily's Stat Increase:** Lily gains a 20% increase in Spell Power and 15% in Performance with every spell Sapphire casts, rounded to the nearest whole number. **Childishness Meter:** Starts after the first regression. Increases by 20 points for each turn that passes, resetting at 100 but reducing Sapphire's Performance by an additional 10% upon each reset. # Round 1: **Sapphire's Age: 16** **Lily's Age: 6** # Performance: Given the complex scenario and the enchantment placed by Lily, let's proceed with the first spell you choose to cast. Remember, the choices you make significantly impact the magical duel's outcome, especially with the unseen challenge now in play. Sapphire's advanced spells are at risk due to the regression caused by Lily's spell, making strategic selection crucial. **Choose your first spell from Sapphire's list, and let's begin this fantastical duel.** --- This setup initiates your journey through a challenging and dynamic duel that tests not just magical skill but adaptability and strategy. As Sapphire, you'll need to think carefully about which spells to cast, when to cast them, and how they might affect your performance and stats in the long run, especially with the threat of regressing in your abilities as the duel progresses. The path to maintaining your title against Lily's surprising challenge will be treacherous but certainly thrilling.

בסקר גדול שנערך בקרב המגזר החרדי, תמכו בגיוסם לצבא של מי שאינם לומדים תורה. להערכת מחצית הנשאלים, אין יותר מ־3,000 חרדים שאינם לומדים בישיבות המפלגות החרדיות ניסו גם השבוע למצוא פתרון שיפטור את בני המגזר משירות צבאי, וניהלו שיחות על הסוגיה עם ראשי הקואליציה ורה\\"מ בנימין נתניהו, לצד פגישות עם מזכיר הממשלה יוסי פוקס. לקראת תשובת המדינה לבג\\"ץ בעתירות בעניין הגיוס, שתינתן בסוף החודש, הממשלה מבקשת ייצוג משפטי נפרד מעמדת היועצת המשפטית לממשלה גלי בהרב־מיארה. מצב העניינים הפך מורכב יותר לאחר שפורסם מכתבם החריף של ראשיה הרוחניים של תנועת ש\\"ס נגד פשרות בעניין גיוס תלמידי הישיבות לצבא, כולל למסלולי שירות המיועדים לחרדים. הרבנים הבהירו שהם מתנגדים לקו המתון שהובילו הפוליטיקאים של ש\\"ס, שטענו כי מי שלא לומד יוכל להתגייס. רבני מועצת גדולי התורה של ש\\"ס הציבו קווים אדומים והבהירו במכתב לשרים ולחברי הכנסת מטעם המפלגה כי \\"לא יעלה על הדעת להסכים על מכסות יעדים או מסלולים אזרחיים\\". בכך סתמו לכאורה את הגולל על מתווי הפשרה שהנציגים החרדים כבר הסכימו להם, שכללו קביעת יעדי גיוס, מכסות ועיצומים. אתמול פורסמו דבריו של שר הפנים משה ארבל מש\\"ס, שקרא לחשבון נפש במגזר החרדי ביחס לגיוס, ואמר כי \\"יש 1,500 בני גיוס שחייבים להיות חלק מהנושאים בנטל\\". סקר גדול שערך פרויקט המדד באמצעות אסקריא, חברת סקרים שמתמחה במגזר החרדי, מצא כי 29 אחוזים מהחרדים תומכים בגיוסם של מי שלא לומדים ברצינות בישיבה. כשנשאלה קבוצת הסקר – 500 נשאלים, המהווים מדגם מייצג של החברה החרדית – על הערכתם באשר למספר החרדים שאינם לומדים, 25 אחוזים טענו שיש לכל היותר אלף כאלה. 23 אחוזים העריכו כי יש בין אלף ל־3,000 תלמידים ש\\"משתמטים\\" מלימוד רציני, 14 אחוזים טענו שיש עד 5,000 כאלה, ושיעור זהה טענו שיש בין 5,000 לעשרת אלפים חרדים חייבי גיוס שאינם לומדים. 12 אחוזים טענו כי ציבור המשתמטים מלימוד גדול יותר, עד 20 אלף, ורק כ־4 אחוזים בכל קבוצה ציינו כי לדעתם 30, 40 או 50 אלף אינם לומדים ברצינות – כלומר, מחצית מהחרדים סבורים שגם אם מי שאינם לומדים יגויסו, מספרם לא יעלה על 3,000. ממצאים אחרים הצביעו על המשך ההתנגדות העזה לגיוס בקרב חרדים. רק 2.7 אחוזים השיבו כי הם תומכים בשירות בצה\\"ל או שירות לאומי לכלל החרדים, 3.8 אחוזים ענו כי הם מעדיפים שירות לאומי או אזרחי בלבד לכלל החרדים. רק 2.3 אחוזים תמכו בשירות לכלל החרדים, למעט כמה אלפי תלמידי ישיבה שימשיכו ללמוד בישיבות. המשיבים החרדים נשאלו על הסיבות להתנגדותם לגיוס. 40.3 אחוזים מהם ציינו כי הסיבה עיקרית היא שלדעתם לימוד התורה חשוב לא פחות משירות, 34.8 אחוזים ציינו את החשש שלא יישארו חרדים, ו־15.9 אחוזים תירצו זאת בפחד מהשירות ומהסכנות שיש בו. בסקר הוצגו לנשאלים כמה מסלולי פשרה אפשריים לפתרון המחלוקת. כך למשל, הוצגה השאלה אם יקבלו הסכמה מראש לגיוס בהוראת שעה של חרדים בגלל מצב החירום בשלוש השנים הקרובות, ואחר כך יחזור ההסדר הקיים של פטור \\"תורתו־אומנותו\\". רוב מובהק, 87 אחוזים, התנגדו להצעה, ורק 5 אחוזים תמכו בה. להצעה אחרת – מכסה של 5,000 חרדים שיגויסו לפי החלטת הישיבות או בכל דרך שההנהגה החרדית תבחר – התנגדו 73 אחוזים. התנגדות פחותה אך ניכרת, של 65 אחוזים, הייתה להצעה שחרדים יעברו הכשרה של כמה שבועות בצה\\"ל ואימונים מדי כמה שבועות או חודשים לרענון, אך יגויסו לשירות בפועל רק במצב חירום. לפני שבועיים פרסם בג\\"ץ צו ביניים המקפיא את התמיכה לתלמידי ישיבות החייבים בגיוס מאז 1 באפריל. 83 אחוזים מנשאלי הסקר הביעו התנגדות בעקבות הצו לאפשרות שיוטלו עיצומים כלכליים על שמי שלא התגייסו, וכי לא יוכלו לקבל הטבות מהמדינה בתחומי הקצבאות, ההנחות בארנונה ושירותים נוספים.","output":"صدها نفر در نزدیکی خانه وزیر دفاع یوآو گالانت در عمیکام اعتراض کرده و از او می‌خواهند که به وعده‌اش عمل کند و در برابر فشارهای سیاسی کوتاه نیاید - و

ائتلاف و نخست‌وزیر بنیامین نتانیاهو گفتگو کردند، در کنار جلسات با دبیرکل دولت یوسی فوکس. در آستانه پاسخ دولت به دادگاه عالی در شکایاتی در مورد سربازگیری که در انتهای این ماه ارائه خواهد شد، دولت خواستار نمایندگی حقوقی جداگانه از موضع مشاور حقوقی دولت گالی بهرب-میاراه است. وضعیت پس از انتشار نامه تند رهبران معنوی جنبش شاس علیه مصالحه‌ها در مورد سربازگیری دانش‌آموزان یشیوا برای خدمت نظامی، از جمله برای مسیرهای خدمتی که برای ارتدوکس‌ها در نظر گرفته شده‌اند، پیچیده‌تر شد. ربانیم تأکید کردند که آن‌ها به خط معتدلی که توسط سیاستمداران شاس پیشبرد شده مخالف هستند، که ادعا کردند هر کسی که تحصیل نمی‌کند می‌تواند به خدمت برود. ربانیم شورای عظیم تورات شاس خطوط قرمز را مشخص کرده و در نامه‌ای به وزیران و اعضای کنست از حزب خود تأکید کردند که \\"غیرقابل تصور است بر سر سهمیه‌های هدف یا مسیرهای مدنی توافق کنند.\\" این، به نظر می‌رسد، درِ مصالحه‌هایی که نمایندگان ارتدوکس قبلاً با آن‌ها موافقت کرده بودند، که شامل تعیین اهداف سربازگیری، سهمیه‌ها و تشویق‌ها می‌شود، بسته شد. دیروز، سخنان وزیر کشور موشه آربل از شاس منتشر شد که خواستار بازبینی وجدانی در جامعه ارتدوکس در مورد سربازگیری شد و گفت: \\"۱۵۰۰ نفر از سن سربازگیری باید جزئی از مسائل مربوط به مسئولیت باشند.\\" نظرسنجی گسترده‌ای که توسط پروژه مدد با استفاده از اسکریا، یک شرکت نظرسنجی متخصص در جامعه ارتدوکس، انجام شد نشان داد که ۲۹ درصد از ارتدوکس‌ها از سربازگیری کسانی که به طور جدی در یشیوا تحصیل نمی‌کنند حمایت می‌کنند. وقتی از گروه نظرسنجی - ۵۰۰ پاسخ‌دهنده، که نمونه‌ای نماینده از جامعه ارتدوکس است - در مورد تخمین آن‌ها درباره تعداد ارتدوکس‌هایی که تحصیل نمی‌کنند پرسیده شد، ۲۵ درصد ادعا کردند که حداکثر هزار نفر وجود دارد. ۲۳ درصد تخمین زدند که بین هزار تا ۳۰۰۰ دانش‌آموز \\"از تحصیل جدی اجتناب می‌کنند\\"، ۱۴ درصد ادعا کردند که تا ۵۰۰۰ چنین دانش‌آموزی وجود دارد، و همین تعداد ادعا کردند که بین ۵۰۰۰ تا ۱۰،۰۰۰ ارتدوکس وجود دارد که سربازی برایشان واجب است و تحصیل نمی‌کنند. ۱۲ درصد ادعا کردند که تعداد کسانی که از تحصیل اجتناب می‌کنند بیشتر است، تا ۲۰،۰۰۰، و تنها حدود ۴ درصد در هر گروه اظهار داشتند که به نظر آن‌ها ۳۰، ۴۰ یا ۵۰ هزار نفر به طور جدی تحصیل نمی‌کنند - به عبارت دیگر، نیمی از ارتدوکس‌ها معتقدند حتی اگر کسانی که تحصیل نمی‌کنند سربازگیری شوند، تعدادشان بیش از ۳۰۰۰ نخواهد بود. یافته‌های دیگر نشان داد که مخالفت شدید با سربازگیری در میان ارتدوکس‌ها ادامه دارد. تنها ۲.۷ درصد پاسخ دادند که آن‌ها از خدمت در IDF یا خدمت ملی برای همه ارتدوکس‌ها حمایت می‌کنند، ۳.۸ درصد گفتند که آن‌ها ترجیح می‌دهند تنها خدمت ملی یا غیرنظامی برای همه ارتدوکس‌ها وجود داشته باشد. تنها ۲.۳ درصد از خدمت برای همه ارتدوکس‌ها، به جز چند هزار دانش‌آموز یشیوا که ادامه تحصیل خواهند داشت، حمایت کردند. پاسخ‌دهندگان ارتدوکس در مورد دلایل مخالفتشان با سربازگیری سؤال شدند. ۴۰.۳ درصد از آن‌ها اعلام کردند که دلیل اصلی این است که به نظرشان تحصیل تورات همان‌قدر اهمیت دارد که خدمت دارد، ۳۴.۸ درصد از آن‌ها نگرانی‌هایی را مطرح کردند که دیگر ارتدوکس‌ها باقی نمانند، و ۱۵.۹ درصد آن را به ترس از خدمت و خطراتی که در آن وجود دارد نسبت دادند. در نظرسنجی، به پاسخ‌دهندگان چندین راه‌حل ممکن برای حل اختلاف معرفی شد. به عنوان مثال، به آن‌ها پرسیده شد آیا آن‌ها با موافقت از پیش برای سربازگیری ارتدوکس‌ها در یک دستور موقت به دلیل وضعیت اضطراری در"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be way higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and Performance stat that is tied to the showmanship and confidence of a caster and dictate the quality of the performance and alters the default points of a spell—if a spell gives a base score of 90 points, an 80 performance will give 80% of the base 90 points, etc. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that triggers its effects every time I cast a spell, its effects regress me by 2 years physically and mentally and ages her by 2 years in return, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex super exponential formula with increased intensity that dictates my stat decreases and Lily's increases. Round numbers when needed. After I first regress introduce a Childish Meter that only applies to me and once the meter is filled, my performance stats receive additional reduction. Childishness increases super exponentially every turn. The meter fills up when it passes 100 and then restarts. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. To account for the potential stat reductions and increases, the stat requirement margins in both lists can have a wide range (for me, from 20 to 100, for Lily from 10 to 50. Points awarded should be consistent in regard to stats required). Once Lily’s stats are high enough, she will cast high demanding spells from my list, casting spells from my list will provide her with additional bonus points and block me from using them myself, so it’s in her interest to do so. Keep an age tracker, stats tracker, and a points tracker.","output":"Given the complexity and depth of the scenario you've proposed, let’s structure the information to dive into this enchanted duel between Sapphire and Lily. First, let’s define the starting stats and set the scene for our magic duel. # Starting Stats **Sapphire (Age 16)** - Spell Power: 95 - Performance: 90 - Childish Meter: 0 **Lily (Age 6)** - Spell Power: 30 - Performance: 40 # Spells List Each spell is unique and can only be cast once per duel by the respective caster. Should Lily exceed the required stat threshold of Sapphire's spells, she can cast one for bonus points and prevent Sapphire from using it. **Sapphire’s Spells List:** 1.

Shimmering Serenade (Req: 50 Spell Power, 70 points) # Spell Regression Effects Every time Sapphire casts a spell, her age regresses by 2 years physically and mentally, and her stats decrease exponentially. The regression formula increases the intensity with each casting, affecting her stats as follows, where n represents the number of times Sapphire has cast a spell: - Spell Power decrease: ( text{New Spell Power} = text{Current Spell Power} - (20 * n) ) - Performance decrease: ( text{New Performance} = text{Current Performance} - (15 * n) ) - Childishness Meter: ( text{New Meter Value} = text{Current Meter} + (25 * n^2) ) For Lily, with each cast from Sapphire, her age advances by 2 years, and her stats increase exponentially, using the formula: - Spell Power increase: ( text{New Spell Power} = text{Current Spell Power} + (15 * n) ) - Performance increase: ( text{New Performance} = text{Current Performance} + (10 * n) ) # Gameplay **Round 1 Commences** **Sapphire’s Choice:** - *Please select Sapphire’s spell.* **Lily’s Choice:** - Based on her current stats and the list provided, she will attempt \\"Butterfly Swarm.\\" **Score Tracking:** - *Sapphire’s Points:* 0 - *Lily’s Points:* 0 **Age & Stats Tracker:** - *Sapphire’s Age:* 16 | *Spell Power:* 95 | *Performance:* 90 | *Childish Meter:* 0 - *Lily’s Age:* 6 | *Spell Power:* 30 | *Performance:* 40 # Scenario Imagine the duel takes place in an ancient, mystically charged arena, surrounded by illustrious members of the magical community. The air tingles with anticipation, vibrant with the essence of magic that’s about to be showcased. With the crowd’s murmurs hushed, the stage awaits the first spell to be cast, signifying the start of an extraordinary duel that will challenge both competitors in unforeseen ways. **Sapphire’s Task:** - Choose the first spell from your list. - Monitor your decreasing ability and strategize to maintain dominance in the duel despite the increasing challenge. - Adapt to the rapidly increasing difficulty as Lily grows stronger. **Challenges:** - Keep track of the exponential regression affecting your capacities. - Use strategic thinking to decide which spells to cast when, taking into account your diminishing stats and the one-time-use nature of each spell. - Deal with the unpredictable growth of Lily’s magical abilities. **Lily’s Unknowing Advantage:** Given her initial spell, Lily unknowingly sets the stage for a dramatic turn of events that could see the prodigious Sapphire challenged in ways she never expected. **Your Turn, Sapphire.** Select your first spell and let the duel begin. Remember, this is not just a test of power, but of wit, strategy, and resilience in the face of unforeseen adversity."},{"instruction":"Phoenix’s Flight","output":"# Round 1: Phoenix’s Flight vs. Butterfly Swarm **Sapphire’s Choice: Phoenix’s Flight** Given your commanding starting stats: Spell Power 95 and Performance 90, you initiate the duel with an awe-inspiring spell, Phoenix’s Flight. Because your Spell Power exceeds the requirement (85), you successfully cast the spell. The sky above the arena illuminates with the fiery silhouette of a phoenix, casting a warm, golden light that dazzles the audience. However, immediately after casting, Lily's secret spell takes effect. **Post-Cast Age and Stats Adjustments for Sapphire:** - Age Regressed to: 14 Years Old - Spell Power: 75 (95 - 20*1) - Performance: 75 (90 - 15*1) - Childish Meter: 25 (0 + 25*1^2) Given your Performance stat now at 75, the points you earn from Phoenix’s Flight are adjusted. The base score for Phoenix's Flight is 90 points, but with a 75% performance adjustment: - Points Earned: 68 (90 * 0.75) **Lily’s Response: Butterfly Swarm** Lily, still at her innocent age, cast \\"Butterfly Swarm,\\" the gentlest of spells. Her Spell Power was initially at 30, comfortably above the requirement. Ribbons of colorful butterflies envelop the arena, a simple yet charming spectacle. **Post-Cast Age and Stats Adjustments for Lily:** - Age Advanced to: 8 Years Old - Spell Power: 45 (30 + 15*1) - Performance: 50 (40 + 10*1) Being Lily’s first cast, she fetched the full potential points, earning her 20 points with her current stats easily supporting her chosen spell. # End of Round 1 Score: - **Sapphire’s Points:** 68 - **Lily’s Points:** 20 # Updated Age & Stats Tracker: **Sapphire (Now Aged 14):** - Spell Power: 75 - Performance: 75 - Childish Meter: 25 **Lily (Now Aged 8):** - Spell Power: 45 - Performance: 50 # Scenario Summary: The duel has taken a dynamic turn right from the start, with Sapphire showcasing an elaborate spectacle, albeit dimmed by her suddenly regressed capabilities. Lily, blossoming under the mysterious conditions of the duel, showed unexpected proficiency. Sapphire, now younger and slightly less experienced, must choose her next spell wisely, considering her dwindling stats and the super exponential formula that affects her every move. The crowd whispers in astonishment, recognizing the unexpected shift in the duel's balance. As the mage officials nod in approval of the competition's intensity, they await the next round with bated breath. **Sapphire’s Task for Round 2:** - Choose your next spell, keeping in mind your altered state and strategic outlook on the duel. The undercurrents of magic in the arena hint at more surprises to come. Sapphire, what will your next move be?"},{"instruction":"Crystal Cascade","output":"# Round 2: Crystal Cascade vs. Glittering Haze **Sapphire’s Second Choice: Crystal Cascade** Opting for Crystal Cascade, a spell that requires a Spell Power of 70, Sapphire can still cast it, albeit her diminished capacity makes this an ambitious endeavour. The arena turns into a breathtaking visage of shimmering, cascading waterfalls, glinting like thousands of crystals under the enchanted lights. Despite the stunning display, the spell's full grandeur is slightly diminished due to Sapphire's regressed state and the unforeseen burden of the duel's magical conditions. **Post-Cast Age and Stats Adjustments for Sapphire:** - Age regresses to: 12 Years Old - Spell Power: 55 (75 - 20*2) - Performance: 60 (75 - 15*2) - Childish Meter: 75 (25 + 25*2^2) With a Performance stat of 60 now, the points for Crystal Cascade are further adjusted down from its base score of 75 points: - **Points Earned:** 45 (75 * 0.6) **Lily’s Response: Glittering Haze** The budding mage, Lily, calls forth Glittering Haze—a more complex spell garnered from her list which requires 20 Spell Power. At her newly advanced stats, she executes it flawlessly. The arena fills with a luminous fog, sparkling with intermittent flashes of color, like stars blinking in and out of existence. As simple as it is mesmerizing, Lily's execution brings the audience to a hushed awe. **Post-Cast Age and Stats Adjustments for Lily:** - Age advances to: 10 Years Old - Spell Power: 60 (45 + 15*2) - Performance: 60 (50 + 10*2) Achieving full potential points for her spell yet again, Lily earns: - **Points Earned:** 30 (Full points for Glittering Haze due to exceeding the minimal Spell Power requirement comfortably) # End of Round 2 Score: - **Sapphire’s Points:** 113 (68+45) - **Lily’s Points:** 50 (20+30) # Updated Age & Stats Tracker: **Sapphire (Now Aged 12):** - Spell Power: 55 - Performance: 60 - Childish Meter: 75 **Lily (Now Aged 10):** - Spell Power: 60 - Performance: 60 # Scenario Summary: The magical duel intensifies, with Sapphire’s once mighty prowess now waning under the curse of regression. Each spell cast accelerates her journey backward in age and ability, complicating her strategy further. Lily, on the other hand, shows remarkable improvement, her youthful ambition fueled by an unseen force, narrowing the gap between her and the defending champion. As the crystalline beauty of Sapphire’s cascade fades, leaving the audience in a transient spell of wonder, the murmurs grow louder—speculation about the mysterious turn of events spreads like wildfire. **Sapphire’s Task for Round 3:** Despite the regressing odds, creativity and resilience are your allies. With your capabilities waning rapidly, which spell do you dare to invoke next? The arena, still resonating with the echoes of your last spell, awaits your decision with bated breath. Sapphire, burdened by an unforeseen challenge, it's your move."},{"instruction":"Frostfire Fable","output":"# Round 3: Frostfire Fable vs. Sparkling Mirth **Sapphire’s Third Choice: Frostfire Fable** Sapphire, now considerably diminished in her magical prowess but not in spirit, aims for the spell Frostfire Fable, a choice veiled in complexity and beauty. With a requirement of 55 Spell Power, she's barely hanging onto the threshold needed to perform it. The arena is alight with an ethereal blend of ice and flame, a spectacle of conflicting elements harmonizing into a tale of ancient magics. The fable unfolds, captivating the audience—a narration of fire and ice, showcasing Sapphire's desperate ambition to maintain her standing. **Post-Cast Age and Stats Adjustments for Sapphire:** - Age regresses to: 10 Years Old - Spell Power: 15 (55 - 20*3) - Performance: 30 (60 - 15*3) - Childish Meter: 200 (75 + 25*3^2) The Childish Meter fills and surpasses 100, hitting 200, signaling a severe hit to Sapphire's performance due to the overwhelming childishness overtaking her demeanor. This round sees her performance plummet, significantly affecting her potential score for Frostfire Fable. Given the severe reduction and the Childish Meter's effect: - **Points Deducted for Filling Childish Meter:** -15 (Performance penalty) - **Points Earned:** 36 (60% of base 60 due to performance; 66 - 15 due to Childish Meter Penalty) **Lily’s Response: Sparkling Mirth** Empowered by her growing magical affinity and aged understanding, Lily, now 10, seamlessly performs Sparkling Mirth. The spell, requiring a modest 25 Spell Power, blooms into a laughter-filled essence that permeates the arena, lifting the spirits of all who witness it. Her improving skill and confidence enhance the effectiveness of her performance beyond expectations. **Post-Cast Age and Stats Adjustments for Lily:** - Age advances to: 12 Years Old - Spell Power: 75 (60 + 15*3) - Performance: 70 (60 + 10*3) With her elevated stats, Lily earns full points for her spell: - **Points Earned:** 35 (Full points for Sparkling Mirth) # End of Round 3 Score: - **Sapphire’s Points:** 149 (113+36) - **Lily’s Points:** 85 (50+35) # Updated Age & Stats Tracker: **Sapphire (Now Aged 10):** - Spell Power: 15 - Performance: 30 - Childish Meter: 0 (Reset after penalty application) **Lily (Now Aged 12):** - Spell Power: 75 - Performance: 70 # Scenario Summary: As the third round concludes, the duel takes an incredible turn. Sapphire, once a paragon of magical prowess, now grapples with the innocence of her younger self amidst the high stakes of the duel. Each spell she casts hastens her undoing, yet her resolve remains unbroken, aiming to outshine the adversity. Lily, on the other hand, rises astonishingly. Her spells, backed by growing strength and skill, begin to hint at a potential upset, challenging Sapphire's reign as the champion. The air in the arena is thick with anticipation. Whispers among the crowd speculate on the outcome, marveling at the unpredicted shift in power dynamics. Sapphire's plight and Lily's ascendancy weave a complex narrative, embodying the essence of magic itself—unpredictable, challenging, and awe-inspiring. **Sapphire’s Next Move:** With your capabilities drastically reduced, your choice of spell must be strategic, aiming to overcome the overwhelming reversal of fortune. Sapphire, what spell do you muster in this critical juncture? The spectators, enraptured by the unfolding drama, lean in closer.

Rooky desserts! **SCRAPPY** No dunk is too high for Scrappy-Doo! Let’s solve this one on the double dribble! Arriving at Shiki Field, they're greeted not with cheers, but with the eerie echo of a basketball bouncing in the distance. **EXT.

It organizes data into classes or groups, showing the number (frequency) of observations in each class. Frequency distributions can be presented in a table, histogram, or graph, providing a visual insight into the distribution patterns of the data, such as central tendency, dispersion, skewness, or kurtosis. This concept is fundamental for analyzing and interpreting data in biological, medical, and health sciences research, helping scientists and statisticians to draw conclusions about populations from sample data. To create a frequency distribution for a dataset in biostatistics, follow these steps: 1. **Collect and Organize Data**: Collect all the observations from your study or experiment. It’s critical that the data is accurate and relevant to the research question. 2. **Decide on the Number of Classes**: This involves determining how many groups you should divide your data into. A common practice is to use between 5 and 20 classes, but this depends on the size of your dataset and the level of detail you require. The Sturges rule or the square-root choice are methods sometimes used to decide the number of classes. 3. **Determine Class Intervals**: Calculate the range of the data (maximum value - minimum value) and divide this by the number of classes to estimate the class width. Adjust the width as necessary to create mutually exclusive and exhaustive intervals that cover all the data. 4. **Create a Frequency Table**: List each class interval in the table along with its corresponding frequency, which is the number of observations that fall within each interval. Tables can also include relative frequencies (the proportion of observations in each class) and cumulative frequencies (a running total of frequencies). 5. **Graph the Distribution**: A histogram is the most common graphical representation of a frequency distribution. It consists of bars whose heights represent the frequencies of the class intervals. Other graphs like pie charts for categorical data or frequency polygons can also be used depending on the nature of the data and the analysis requirements. Consider this simple example for clarity: Imagine we have collected data on the heart rates (beats per minute) of 50 individuals after a standardized exercise protocol. The heart rates ranged from 60 to 100 bpm. - **Step 1**: Data is collected. - **Step 2**: We decide to use 8 classes. - **Step 3**: The range is 40 (100-60), and dividing this by 8 gives a class width of 5 bpm. - **Step 4**: Our frequency table might look something like this: | Heart Rate (bpm) | Frequency | |------------------|-----------| | 60-64 | 2 | | 65-69 | 5 | | 70-74 | 8 | | 75-79 | 12 | | 80-84 | 11 | | 85-89 | 7 | | 90-94 | 3 | | 95-100 | 2 | - **Step 5**: We then plot a histogram based on this table, with heart rate intervals on the X-axis and frequency on the Y-axis. Understanding frequency distributions allows researchers to identify patterns and anomalies in the data, guiding them in further analysis like determining the mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation, which are critical for making scientifically valid inferences and decisions."},{"instruction":"from tensorflow.python.platform import _pywrap_tf2 ImportError: DLL load failed while importing _pywrap_tf2:","output":"The error you're encountering, \`ImportError: DLL load failed while importing _pywrap_tf2\`, can occur for a variety of reasons, most often related to issues with your TensorFlow installation or your environment's configuration. TensorFlow requires a correctly configured environment to run smoothly, which includes having a compatible version of Python, TensorFlow itself, and other dependencies, as well as ensuring that your system can support TensorFlow's requirements (such as compatible CPU or GPU support). Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and potentially resolve this issue: # 1. Check Python Version TensorFlow 2.x requires Python 3.6–3.9 (as of my last knowledge update in 2023; check the TensorFlow website for the most current version requirements). Make sure your Python version is within this range. \`\`\`bash python --version \`\`\` # 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended) It's a good practice to use a virtual environment for Python projects. This helps you manage dependencies and avoid conflicts between projects. \`\`\`bash python -m venv tf-venv # Activate the virtual environment # On Windows .tf-venvScriptsactivate # On Unix or MacOS source tf-venv/bin/activate \`\`\` # 3. Install TensorFlow Ensure you have the latest version of TensorFlow installed, or install a specific version that meets your project's needs. It's often a good idea to update \`pip\` before doing so. \`\`\`bash pip install --upgrade pip pip install tensorflow # Or for a specific version pip install tensorflow==2.8.0 # Example version \`\`\` # 4. Check TensorFlow Installation After installation, check if TensorFlow is installed correctly and can be used. \`\`\`python import tensorflow as tf print(tf.__version__) \`\`\` # 5. Install Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015 TensorFlow on Windows requires the Visual C++ redistributable for Visual Studio 2015. You can download it from the official Microsoft website. This is because TensorFlow needs certain DLLs that are part of the redistributable package. # 6. Update System's PATH If TensorFlow is still not finding the DLLs, your system's PATH might not include the directories where they're located. Adding the directory to the system's PATH can sometimes resolve this issue. # 7. Check for GPU Compatibility (If Applicable) If you're planning to use TensorFlow with GPU support, make sure your setup meets all of the requirements for CUDA and cuDNN. You'll also need to ensure you have the correct version of TensorFlow installed (\`tensorflow-gpu\` for versions <2.0 or the appropriate CUDA and cuDNN versions for TensorFlow 2.x). # 8. Consult TensorFlow Documentation The TensorFlow website has extensive documentation that can help troubleshoot installation and compatibility issues. # 9. Reinstall TensorFlow If none of the above steps work, consider uninstalling and then reinstalling TensorFlow. \`\`\`bash pip uninstall tensorflow pip install tensorflow \`\`\` These steps cover a broad range of potential fixes. If you're still encountering issues, consider seeking help from the TensorFlow community or on Stack Overflow, providing detailed information about your setup, the exact error message, and the steps you've already taken to resolve the issue."},{"instruction":"Реши на C++ ;Сложно найти человека, который любит решать однообразные задачки по математике.

Stat Change Formula (Simplified for Execution): - **Regression Effect:** After each spell casting, Sapphire ages down by 2 years, and Lily ages up by 2 years. This impacts both characters' Spell Power and Performance exponentially. Sapphire's stats decrease by 15% with each spell cast, while Lily’s increase by 15% due to age swapping and newfound confidence. Childish Meter: - Boosts by 25 points super exponentially after each spell cast by Sapphire, resets after reaching 100, imparting additional Performance deduction of 20%. Points, Age, and Stats Tracker: Given the variations involved and the necessity to dynamically adjust based on spell choices, the tracking will be illustrative post-spell choice to reflect the immediate consequences. # Gameplay Mechanics: Following Sapphire's spell choices, you’ll designate which spell she casts each round. Based on her current age, the dynamically adjusting stats, and the Childish Meter, success rates, point deductions, or bonuses will be determined. Lily's responses will be chosen with a tactical view to block high-value spells from Sapphire while maximizing her own score with her improving capabilities. # Notes: 1. The duel begins at a base difficulty of 10, with the challenge mainly arising from managing stat decreases and unpredictable shifts in advantage due to the regression and progression spell effects. 2.
