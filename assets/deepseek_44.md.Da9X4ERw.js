Melson, who has faced heavy criticism in connection with the controversial Fast and Furious gun-trafficking investigation, announced Tuesday that he is stepping down as acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives Also resigning is Dennis Burke, the U.S. attorney in Phoenix whose office oversaw the Fast and Furious program, in which ATF agents purposely allowed weapons to be illegally purchased in the hope of catching Mexican drug cartel leaders.Melson shared the news in a conference call at 11:30 a.m. EDT with supervisors at the bureau's field offices, telling them that he will be moving back to the Department of Justice to serve as a senior advisor with the Office of Legal Programs. His resignation will take effect at 5 p.m. EDT.Attorney Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. announced that B. Todd Jones, the U.S. attorney in Minneapolis, will replace Melson as acting director, effective Wednesday.Despite the problems with Fast and Furious under Melson's tenure, Holder praised the outgoing acting director and his new responsibilities.\\"Ken brings decades of experience at the department and extensive knowledge in forensic science to his new role and I know he will be a valuable contributor on these issues,\\" Holder said. \\"As he moves into this new role, I want to thank Ken for his dedication to the department over the last three decades.\\"But simply transferring Melson within the Justice Department did not immediately sit well with some critics, including Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), who has asked Justice officials for an accounting of all Fast and Furious cases in Texas.\\"Instead of reassigning those responsible for Fast and Furious within the Department of Justice,\\" Cornyn said, \\"Atty. Gen. Holder should ask for their resignations and come clean on all alleged gun-walking operations, including a detailed response to allegations of a Texas-based scheme.\\"Under Melson's leadership, ATF launched Operation Fast and Furious, through which agents were to watch -- and in some cases record on video -- illegal gun sales and then use surveillance teams and electronic eavesdropping to follow the guns and learn how the weapons were moved. The goal was to arrest cartel leaders overseeing gun smuggling on the U.S. side of the border with Mexico But the chase for guns and cartel leaders soon hit a dead end. The ATF was attempting to follow each of the weapons as they were moved from the straw men who bought them illegally at gun shops to what officials expected would be cartel higher-ups in the U.S., who would move them to Mexico.The agency, which didn't have the resources to follow so many weapons, soon lost track of many of them. When officials did follow them to the next level, the buyers of the guns often turned out to be Mexicans living legally in the U.S. and not cartel honchos.An investigation by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, chaired by Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), uncovered emails that showed Melson was regularly briefed on the botched operation.richard.serrano@latimes.com ||||| The controversy over the Fast and Furious anti-gun-trafficking operation upended the careers of two Justice Department officials Tuesday as the interim head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was transferred to an obscure, new post and the well-connected chief federal prosecutor in Arizona resigned.      ATF’s current acting director, Ken Melson, will move to Justice’s Office of Legal Policy this week to become a senior adviser on forensic science, the Justice Department said. Dennis Burke, the U.S. Attorney for Arizona who oversaw prosecutions in that state related to the Fast and Furious operation, stepped down and left the federal government.      Text Size -      +      reset Issa: ATF actions 'felony stupid' POLITICO 44      Neither Attorney General Eric Holder’s statements nor one from Burke made direct reference to the high-profile congressional investigation or a separate Justice Department probe into the ATF-led operation, which was aimed at reducing the flow of guns to Mexican drug gangs but allegedly allowed as many as 2,000 firearms to pass into the hands of criminals.      However, Holder and Burke — a prominent figure in Arizona politics — both made vague allusions to distractions currently facing federal prosecutors in Arizona.      “I am grateful to Dennis for his dedication and service to the Department of Justice over these many years and commend his decision to place the interests of the U.S. Attorney’s office above all else,” Holder said.      “My long tenure in public service has been intensely gratifying. It has also been intensely demanding. For me, it is the right time to move on to pursue other aspects of my career and my life and allow the office to move ahead,” Burke said in a statement confirming that he’d submitted his resignation to President Barack Obama.      At a House hearing in June, ATF agents complained that their efforts to seize weapons and arrest alleged traffickers were impeded by the unwillingness of federal prosecutors in Burke’s office to intercede immediately after suspicious gun buys. The agents said prosecutors blamed judicial rulings about the evidence needed to prove gun trafficking or other crimes.      Sources in Washington and Arizona said Burke was summoned for an interview on Aug. 18 by the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, chaired by Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.). Burke quickly became the focus of heated questioning and ire from Republicans, a source close to Burke said.      “My understanding is it did not go well,” the source said. “The bottom line is someone’s head needed to roll. … No one at the Justice Department wanted to back him up.”      Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the top Democrat on the committee, said in a statement that Melson and Burke both acknowledged to the panel that “mistakes were made and that Operation Fast and Furious lacked adequate protections for public safety. Fresh leadership will allow ATF to move forward and focus on its vital mission of enforcing our nation’s gun laws.”      A lower-ranking prosecutor who dealt with the Fast & Furious operation, Emory Hurley, was also reassigned from criminal cases to civil litigation, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office said. The change, which took place Monday, came at his own request, the spokeswoman said.      The White House had no comment Tuesday on the personnel moves.      Holder offered no reason for Melson’s reassignment, but simply noted his long tenure at the department and his expertise in forensics.      Melson, a veteran federal prosecutor, took the top spot at the ATF on an interim basis in 2009 and oversaw the execution of Fast and Furious, an effort that was aimed at rooting out gun smugglers selling weapons to Mexican cartels. Investigators say the ATF lost track of as many as 2,000 guns that were sold during the operation, including two that were found near the scene of the killing of a Border Patrol agent last December.      In July, Melson gave a lengthy interview to congressional investigators outside the presence of — and without advance notice to — DOJ’s legislative affairs team. In the interview, Melson said he had objected to aspects of DOJ’s plans for handing the legislative inquiries and that he had been told not to tell Congress why mid-level ATF officials with responsibility for the Fast and Furious operation were reassigned. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"A man named Kenneth Melson and another man, Dennis Burke, both had important jobs in the government. They were involved in a project called Fast and Furious, which was about stopping bad people from getting guns. But the project didn't work well, and this caused many people to be unhappy with them. So, Kenneth decided to leave his current job and move to another job in the government. Dennis also decided to quit his job. Now, a new man, Todd Jones, will take Kenneth's old job to try to make things better.

Article: All reform agreements between justice department and local police forces – including Ferguson and Baltimore – to be reexamined, attorney general says      The US attorney general on Monday ordered a nationwide review of all reform agreements with local police departments, placing a key part of Barack Obama’s legacy on criminal justice in jeopardy.      Jeff Sessions signalled in a memo filed to a federal court that “consent decrees” such as those struck in recent years with troubled departments in Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore, Maryland, could be scrapped or scaled down.      “It is not the responsibility of the federal government to manage non-federal law enforcement agencies,” Sessions said in the memo.      Sessions said he had instructed senior officials to reexamine all formal agreements between the department of justice (DoJ) and police agencies – from training initiatives, to collaborative reform programs, to legal consent decrees – to ensure they fit his series of operating principles for his department.      These included: “The misdeeds of individual bad actors should not impugn or undermine the legitimate and honorable work that law enforcement officers and agencies perform in keeping American communities safe.”      The NAACP’s legal defense fund slammed the move, calling it “a blatant attempt by the justice department to abandon its obligations under federal civil rights law and the US constitution”.      US attorney dismissed by Trump speaks out on Chicago's need for police reform Read more      In a statement, the ACLU also took issue with the attorney general’s suggestion that abuse within police departments was attributable to “the misdeeds of individual bad actors”.      “There is no national census of police misconduct to support the DOJ’s notion that there are only a few bad actors in law enforcement. Indeed, DOJ’s own investigative reports over the past eight years document systemic unlawful policing practices of local law enforcement in cities across the country.”      Sessions, a hardline conservative who was previously a US senator for Alabama, has frequently accused the Obama administration of unfairly maligning all police because of the use of arguably excessive force by officers in a handful of high-profile lethal cases.      Sessions made clear during his confirmation hearings in Washington in January that he was prepared to weaken legal reform agreements in order to hand authority back to local police chiefs.      Consent decrees are court-enforced lists of reforms that are typically struck when justice department civil rights investigators discover a “pattern or practice” of unconstitutional policing by a department. A total of 25 such investigations were opened under the Obama administration.      Sessions has repeatedly expressed unease about such agreements, saying he believes the federal government has too frequently interfered with local policing.      Federal officials are currently enforcing 19 agreements, according to a report released earlier this year. This includes several reached by the Obama administration with cities such as Cleveland; Newark, New Jersey; and Albuquerque, New Mexico.      The new Sessions memo was filed to court in Maryland in the case of the justice department’s consent decree with police in Baltimore. Attorneys for the justice department asked the court for a 90-day pause so it could “review and assess” the plan.      Trump breaks from Obama with crime crackdown and 'blue lives matter' protections Read more      The agreement was reached following severe unrest in the city following the death in April 2015 of Freddie Gray, a 24-year-old black man who died from a broken neck sustained in the back of a Baltimore police van. Baltimore officers had faced a series of allegations of misconduct and brutality in previous years.      The consent decree with Ferguson grew out of the scathing findings of an inquiry prompted by unrest around the fatal police shooting of unarmed black 18-year-old Michael Brown in August 2014. It demands that the Missouri city overhaul its criminal justice system and refocus its policing on de-escalation and avoiding the use of force.      Changes to consent decrees would need to be proposed in court by justice department officials and approved by a federal judge. In a statement on Monday night, Catherine Pugh, Baltimore’s mayor, said: “We strongly oppose any delay in moving forward.” She said a delay “may have the effect of eroding the trust that we are working hard to establish”.      During the presidential campaign, Trump earned the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police union, and the move is likely to be popular among police officers.      “I think most rank and file police officers will welcome this news,” said Jim Bueermann, a former California police chief and the head of the Police Foundation, a nonprofit that focuses on policing research. “I think most street cops believe that the federal government has not been fair to them and finds the consent decree process to be intrusive.”      Police chiefs, in contrast, sometimes welcome the role of the justice department, since court-mandated reforms can be a way of forcing city governments to pay for changes, Bueermann added.      With the future of Chicago’s consent decree in limbo, the Chicago police department has pledged to move ahead with reforms regardless of what role the federal government plays. But in a blunt open letter, Chicago’s outgoing US attorney said that city leaders could not be trusted to fulfilthe needed reforms, and the police department needed a consent decree.      Recent justice department investigations into policing in Chicago and Baltimore found evidence to support what many black residents of those cities already believed: that local police departments had engaged in a pattern of unconstitutional policing. The investigations found evidence of stark racial disparities in police enforcement, excessive force, and patterns of unjustified stops, searches and arrests.      In Baltimore, the investigation’s final report described: “Two Baltimores: one wealthy and largely white, the second impoverished and predominantly black. Community members living in the city’s wealthier and largely white neighbourhoods told us that officers tend to be respectful and responsive to their needs, while many individuals living in the city’s largely African-American communities informed us that officers tend to be disrespectful and do not respond promptly to their calls for service.”      Phillip Atiba Goff, a leading researcher on racial bias in policing, called Sessions’ move “a terrible blow” to efforts to build trust between police and communities. “Without the help of a federal consent decree, police executives often cannot effect the changes they know a department needs, changes designed to build trust with communities that are skeptical of their law enforcement.      “Ultimately, I fear that this new direction from DOJ will make communities less safe by making them less trusting – possibly setting us back years or more.” ||||| WASHINGTON — Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered a sweeping review of federal agreements with dozens of law enforcement agencies, an examination that reflects President Trump’s emphasis on law and order and could lead to a retreat on consent decrees with troubled police departments nationwide.      In a memorandum dated March 31 and made public Monday, the attorney general directed his staff to look at whether law enforcement programs adhere to principles put forth by the Trump administration, including one declaring that “the individual misdeeds of bad actors should not impugn” the work police officers perform “in keeping American communities safe.”      As part of its shift in emphasis, the Justice Department went to court on Monday to seek a 90-day delay in a consent decree to overhaul Baltimore’s embattled Police Department. That request came just days before a hearing, scheduled for Thursday in the United States District Court in Baltimore, to solicit public comment on the agreement, which was reached in principle by the city and the Justice Department in the waning days of the Obama administration. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"US Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered a nationwide review of all reform agreements with local police departments, casting doubt on part of former President Barack Obama's criminal justice legacy.

On my visit last Friday, 12 of 20 camping cabins at Manzanita Lake were empty, the pretty campgrounds at Summit Lake had space, and everything was quiet, pristine with world-class recreation opportunities. At Manzanita Lake, you can discover a sapphire lake with views of Lassen Peak, kayaking (with rentals available) and canoeing, and some of the best stillwater flyfishing (you need a pram or kayak) for wild trout in California. Cabin rentals, campsites and a camper’s store are within a walk of a minute or two. That’s just a start. The park is speckled with lakes nestled in high mountain cirques, rich meadows edged with wildflowers and creeks, cragged volcanic wastelands and peaks with top-of-the-world views. The outskirts of the parks includes two gorgeous lakes, Juniper and Butte, both with drive-in campgrounds, the historic Drakesbad Lodge, and 78,900 acres of wilderness with 150 miles of trails.

Question: -  Your diaphragm moves down - Your lungs have more room - Your lungs fill with air - You exhale - Your diaphragm moves back up - Carbon dioxide is exhaled - You start the process over again.  What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process described above is the initiation of inhalation, which involves the contraction of the diaphragm muscle. To provide a comprehensive understanding, let's examine each of the subsequent steps in this respiratory cycle. 1. Diaphragm contraction: The diaphragm, a sheet-like muscle located beneath the lungs, contracts and moves downward. This contraction is triggered by the phrenic nerve, which sends signals from the brain to the diaphragm to initiate the breathing process. The downward movement of the diaphragm creates a negative pressure within the thoracic cavity. 2. Expansion of the lungs: As the diaphragm moves down, the volume of the thoracic cavity increases, creating more room for the lungs to expand. This expansion reduces the pressure within the lungs, allowing air to flow into them. 3. Inhalation: With the diaphragm contracted and lungs expanded, air rich in oxygen is drawn into the lungs through the nose and/or mouth, the trachea, and the bronchi, finally reaching the alveoli, which are tiny air sacs within the lungs. Gas exchange - the process of swapping oxygen and carbon dioxide molecules - occurs at the alveoli, where oxygen enters the bloodstream and carbon dioxide is transferred from the bloodstream into the lungs. 4. Relaxation of the diaphragm: Once the required amount of oxygen has entered the lungs, the diaphragm relaxes and moves back upwards towards its original position. This movement reduces the volume of the thoracic cavity, and increases the pressure within the lungs. 5. Exhalation: As the diaphragm moves back up, the pressure within the lungs forces air rich in carbon dioxide out of the lungs. This exhalation occurs through the bronchi, trachea, and the nose and/or mouth. 6. Removal of carbon dioxide: During exhalation, carbon dioxide, which is a waste product resulting from cellular respiration, is removed from the body. This helps maintain a healthy balance of gases within the body, ensuring that cells receive adequate oxygen to function properly. 7. Respiratory cycle repetition: The process starts all over again, with the diaphragm contracting once more and initiating another inhalation. This continuous and involuntary cycle, known as the respiratory cycle, allows the body to take in the necessary oxygen for cellular respiration, and to remove carbon dioxide waste, thereby sustaining life. In summary, the first step of the process is the contraction of the diaphragm, which initiates inhalation and the subsequent respiratory cycle. This is an essential and continuous process that provides vital oxygen to cells, ensuring that the body remains healthy and functional."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The meaning of the word \\"right\\" changes depending on the context in which it is used, as is the case in the provided sentences. In the first sentence, \\"She is in the right,\\" the word \\"right\\" conveys a sense of correctness, morality, or justice. In this context, it refers to the fact that her position, actions, or beliefs are considered correct, morally sound, or justified by some standard. This usage of the word \\"right\\" expresses a qualitative attribute, suggesting that she is on the side of what is good and fair. In the second sentence, as spoken by Eleanor Roosevelt, \\"Certain rights can never be granted to the government but must be kept in the hands of the people,\\" the word \\"rights\\" refers to legal, social, and political entitlements or powers that people possess. In this context, \\"rights\\" are fundamental principles or freedoms that belong to individuals, which governments should protect and recognize. Examples of such rights include the freedom of speech, the right to a fair trial, and the right to vote. So, when comparing these two sentences, the meanings of \\"right\\" are distinct – the first one is about moral correctness or justice, whereas the second one refers to an individual's entitlements or abilities that ought to be respected and safeguarded. Although the word \\"right\\" appears in both sentences, its different usage based on the context results in separate interpretations of the term."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Generate a 4-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package com.frostwire.android. The answer is:","output":"Title: Excellent and Easy-to-Use Torrent App with Room for Improvement Review: I've been using com.frostwire.android for a few months now, and I must say, I'm satisfied with my experience so far. I rate this app 4 stars out of 5, as it has been a great tool for downloading files quickly and efficiently, as well as providing me with a clean and user-friendly interface for seamless torrenting. There's still room for growth and improvement, but this app is a worthwhile addition to my arsenal of torrenting tools. One of the most significant advantages of the FrostWire app is its effortless usability. It comes equipped with a neat, minimalistic, and organized interface that makes the overall experience enjoyable and painless. Even for someone who might be new to torrenting, this app provides an easy way to search for and download torrents without any complications. The search function works seamlessly, allowing users to find exactly what they're looking for in a matter of seconds, saving time and effort. The app also provides other interesting features that make it stand out from the competition. One such feature is the in-built music and video player that lets users preview and play downloaded files from within the app, creating a more unified experience and eliminating the need to switch between different apps. Additionally, FrostWire supports batch downloads, which means users can download multiple files at once without having to manage them individually. In terms of performance, the FrostWire app doesn't disappoint. Download speeds are generally fast (depending on the individual torrent's seeders), and it efficiently manages bandwidth usage so that your other tasks and browsing activities aren't affected. Also, I must commend the developers for maintaining a stable app environment with few crashes or glitches. However, the reason I'm giving this app 4 stars instead of 5 lies in its potential for improvement. Firstly, the intrusive ads can be quite bothersome while using the app. While I understand that they may be a necessary source of revenue for the developers, implementing a less invasive advertising strategy or providing an ad-free paid version would be a welcome change. Another area that could use some improvements is the app's battery consumption. I've noticed that the app tends to consume a significant amount of battery life, especially during prolonged downloads. Implementing measures to optimize battery usage while maintaining functionality would make the app even more competitive. Lastly, it would be helpful to see improvements in search engine integration. While the search function works well, having access to more search engines, including the integration of private tracker sites, would allow users to find content across a wider range of sources. This would help increase the overall search efficiency and effectiveness. In conclusion, the com.frostwire.android app provides an impressive torrenting experience, equipped with an easy-to-use interface, efficient download speeds, and useful additional features. However, a few improvements could elevate this app to a solid 5-star experience. Despite these drawbacks, I wholeheartedly recommend this app to anyone looking for a reliable torrent downloader with a streamlined and enjoyable user experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Robert Ervin Howard (January 22, 1906 - June 11, 1936) was an American author who wrote pulp fiction in a diverse range of genres. He is well known for his character Conan the Barbarian and is regarded as the father of the sword and sorcery subgenre. Howard was born and raised in Texas. He spent most of his life in the town of Cross Plains, with some time spent in nearby Brownwood. Context: Howard was born January 22, 1906 in Peaster, Texas, the only son of a traveling country physician, Dr. Isaac Mordecai Howard, and his wife, Hester Jane Ervin Howard. His early life was spent wandering through a variety of Texas cowtowns and boomtowns: Dark Valley (1906), Seminole (1908), Bronte (1909), Poteet (1910), Oran (1912), Wichita Falls (1913), Bagwell (1913), Cross Cut (1915), and Burkett (1917).  During Howard's youth his parents' relationship began to break down. The Howard family had problems with money which may have been exacerbated by Isaac Howard investing in get-rich-quick schemes. Hester Howard, meanwhile, came to believe that she had married below herself. Soon the pair were actively fighting. Hester did not want Isaac to have anything to do with their son. She had a particularly strong influence on her son's intellectual growth. She had spent her early years helping a variety of sick relatives, contracting tuberculosis in the process. She instilled in her son a deep love of poetry and literature, recited verse daily and supported him unceasingly in his efforts to write.  Other experiences would later seep into his prose. Although he loved reading and learning, he found school to be confining and began to hate having anyone in authority over him. Experiences watching and confronting bullies revealed the omnipresence of evil and enemies in the world, and taught him the value of physical strength and violence. Being the son of the local doctor gave Howard frequent exposure to the effects of injury and violence, due to accidents on farms and oil fields combined with the massive increase in crime that came with the oil boom. Firsthand tales of gunfights, lynchings, feuds, and Indian raids developed his distinctly Texan, hardboiled outlook on the world. Sports, especially boxing, became a passionate preoccupation. At the time, boxing was the most popular sport in the country, with a cultural influence far in excess of what it is today. James J. Jeffries, Jack Johnson, Bob Fitzsimmons, and later Jack Dempsey were the names that inspired during those years, and he grew up a lover of all contests of violent, masculine struggle.

They were both very surprised with they findings.  and a hint : In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.

What is the answer to this question? who did bernardo kill in west side story?","output":"In West Side Story, Bernardo, the leader of the Puerto Rican gang called the Sharks, kills Riff, the leader of the white gang called the Jets. The tragic sequence of events that led to this situation stems from the overarching rivalry and animosity between the two major street gangs in the narrative. West Side Story is a modern retelling of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, set in New York City during the 1950s. The Sharks and Jets represent the Montagues and Capulets, respectively, in embedding the feud component from the classic play. Racial tensions predominantly drove the conflict between the two gangs. During the theatrical development, the character of Bernardo is portrayed as a strong, proud, and courageous individual. As the Sharks' leader, he feels a sense of responsibility to protect his fellow members from the inherent discrimination they experience as immigrants in the United States. Love eventually plays a role in exacerbating the conflict between the two gangs when Bernardo's sister, Maria, falls in love with one of the Jets, Tony. The drama-igniting killing occurs during the protagonist's intention to stage a \\"war council\\" in which the feud's climactic rumble would be deliberated. Despite initial intentions to enact a \\"fair fight\\" showdown, unforeseen, tense circumstances provoke Bernardo into killing Riff. In response to the shocking death of his best friend, Tony retaliates and kills Bernardo. Bernardo's tragic death is a pivotal moment in West Side Story, adding increased tension and emotional stakes to the already intense tale of love and rivalry. The story's portrayal of the consequences of racial prejudice and gang violence serves as a cautionary tale, urging audiences to reassess their judgments and prejudices towards others."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Shipman hanged himself in his cell at Wakefield Prison at 06:20 on 13 January 2004, on the eve of his 58th birthday, and was pronounced dead at 08:10. A Prison Service statement indicated that Shipman had hanged himself from the window bars of his cell using bed sheets.  Some of the victims' families said they felt cheated, as his suicide meant they would never have the satisfaction of Shipman's confession nor answers as to why he committed his crimes. The Home Secretary David Blunkett noted that celebration was tempting, saying: \\"You wake up and you receive a call telling you Shipman has topped himself and you think, is it too early to open a bottle? And then you discover that everybody's very upset that he's done it.\\"  His death divided national newspapers, with the Daily Mirror branding him a \\"cold coward\\" and condemning the Prison Service for allowing his suicide to happen. The Sun, however, ran a celebratory front-page headline; \\"Ship Ship hooray!\\" The Independent called for the inquiry into Shipman's suicide to look more widely at the state of Britain's prisons as well as the welfare of inmates. In The Guardian, an article by Sir David Ramsbotham (former Chief Inspector of Prisons) suggested that whole life sentencing be replaced by indefinite sentencing as these would at least give prisoners the hope of eventual release and reduce the risk of their ending their own lives by suicide as well as making their management easier for prison officials.  Shipman's motive for suicide was never established, although he had reportedly told his probation officer that he was considering suicide to assure his wife's financial security after he was stripped of his National Health Service (NHS) pension. Primrose Shipman received a full NHS pension, to which she would not have been entitled had Shipman lived past age 60. Additionally, there was evidence that his wife, who had consistently protested Shipman's innocence despite the overwhelming evidence, had begun to suspect his guilt. Shipman had refused to take part in courses leading toward a full confession of his crimes, leading to temporary removal of privileges, including the opportunity to telephone his wife. During this period, according to Shipman's cellmate, he received a letter from Primrose exhorting him to \\"tell me everything, no matter what\\".

After Shipman's suicide, there were mixed reactions from the public and the media. His death also raised questions about the state of Britain's prisons, inmate welfare, and the potential need for changes in sentencing.

I saw this with a friend a while ago and we both consider ourselves open-minded to the many wonders of cinema, but this sure isn't one of them. While there very well could be some good ideas/concepts and there are certainly some good performances (under the circumstances), it is all buried under random nonsense. Sir Anthony draws way too heavily from the same gene pool as Natural Born Killers, U Turn and similar films as far as the editing is concerned, or maybe he watched himself in Nixon for inspiration.

Read the following context and answer the question. Context: I think that one of the people who caused me the most misery for the longest was someone that I’ll call “Luna”. So, most people have probably met that person that acts all suicidal and then uses that against you. For example, you’re talking to someone like that and you’re having some sort of argument and the moment they realize they aren’t winning they send you pictures of their bloodied wrists and say “This is your fault”. Well, that person was my friend for a long time. Every time I would try to leave her to go to sleep she would threaten to do “something bad” and I knew what she meant, and me, first meeting her when I was around 9 or 10, and I was still extremely naive. So most of the time, I ended up staying awake til 3 AM on school nights and I would get only a few hours of sleep, and she’d be happy because her life wasn’t worsened at all. But I think the thing that made me the most miserable, was the fact that it never got better. No matter how much I talked to her, or how sympathetic I tried to be, or how much I tried to convince her to be happier, it never got better. She still acted super depressed, but like it was a joke. All of these things combined to make me completely miserable because it seemed like it was all for nothing. But I just let it happen, because she was the only person I had and she was really my only “friend” at that point, and all the way up to seventh grade. So for that entire period of time, she certainly wasn’t the only source of misery for me, but she made me feel way worse than I would have if I hadn’t been friends with her.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Stephen Crane (November 1, 1871 - June 5, 1900) was an American poet, novelist, and short story writer. Prolific throughout his short life, he wrote notable works in the Realist tradition as well as early examples of American Naturalism and Impressionism. He is recognized by modern critics as one of the most innovative writers of his generation. The ninth surviving child of Methodist parents, Crane began writing at the age of four and had published several articles by the age of 16. Stephen Crane's fiction is typically categorized as representative of Naturalism, American realism, Impressionism or a mixture of the three. Critic Sergio Perosa, for example, wrote in his essay, \\"Stephen Crane fra naturalismo e impressionismo,\\" that the work presents a \\"symbiosis\\" of Naturalistic ideals and Impressionistic methods. When asked whether or not he would write an autobiography in 1896, Crane responded that he \\"dare not say that I am honest. I merely say that I am as nearly honest as a weak mental machinery will allow.\\" Similarities between the stylistic techniques in Crane's writing and Impressionist painting--including the use of color and chiaroscuro--are often cited to support the theory that Crane was not only an Impressionist but also influenced by the movement. H. G. Wells remarked upon \\"the great influence of the studio\\" on Crane's work, quoting a passage from The Red Badge of Courage as an example: \\"At nightfall the column broke into regimental pieces, and the fragments went into the fields to camp. Tents sprang up like strange plants. Camp fires, like red, peculiar blossoms, dotted the night.... From this little distance the many fires, with the black forms of men passing to and fro before the crimson rays, made weird and satanic effects.\\" Although no direct evidence exists that Crane formulated a precise theory of his craft, he vehemently rejected sentimentality, asserting that \\"a story should be logical in its action and faithful to character. Truth to life itself was the only test, the greatest artists were the simplest, and simple because they were true.\\"  Poet and biographer John Berryman suggested that there were three basic variations, or \\"norms\\", of Crane's narrative style. The first, being \\"flexible, swift, abrupt and nervous\\", is best exemplified in The Red Badge of Courage, while the second (\\"supple majesty\\") is believed to relate to \\"The Open Boat\\", and the third (\\"much more closed, circumstantial and 'normal' in feeling and syntax\\") to later works such as The Monster. Crane's work, however, cannot be determined by style solely on chronology. Not only does his fiction not take place in any particular region with similar characters, but it varies from serious in tone to reportorial writing and light fiction. Crane's writing, both fiction and nonfiction, is consistently driven by immediacy and is at once concentrated, vivid and intense. The novels and short stories contain poetic characteristics such as shorthand prose, suggestibility, shifts in perspective and ellipses between and within sentences. Similarly, omission plays a large part in Crane's work; the names of his protagonists are not commonly used and sometimes they are not named at all.  Crane was often criticized by early reviewers for his frequent incorporation of everyday speech into dialogue, mimicking the regional accents of his characters with colloquial stylization. This is apparent in his first novel, in which Crane ignored the romantic, sentimental approach of slum fiction; he instead concentrated on the cruelty and sordid aspects of poverty, expressed by the brashness of the Bowery's crude dialect and profanity, which he used lavishly. The distinct dialect of his Bowery characters is apparent at the beginning of the text; the title character admonishes her brother saying: \\"Yeh knows it puts mudder out when yes comes home half dead, an' it's like we'll all get a poundin'.\\" Ask a question about this article.","output":"Stephen Crane was a famous writer from a long time ago who wrote poems, stories, and novels. He was known for writing in different styles like Realism, Naturalism, and Impressionism, which helped make his work really special and unique. Sometimes he wrote in a way that showed you the world as it really was, and other times he painted pictures with his words, like an artist would do with colors on a canvas. One of his most famous books is called \\"The Red Badge of Courage.\\" People really liked how he wrote about the feelings of soldiers during a war. Stephen also wrote about everyday people and their lives, but he didn't sugarcoat it. He showed the tough and ugly parts of life, too. And when his characters talked, he made them sound like real people, using the way they would really speak. People keep talking and studying about Stephen Crane today because he was really good at telling stories in different ways, and he knew how to make them feel real and alive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information:  - William John Swainson FLS, FRS (8 October 1789  6 December 1855), was an English ornithologist, malacologist, conchologist, entomologist and artist.  - Nicholas Aylward Vigors (1785  26 October 1840) was an Irish zoologist and politician. He popularized the classification of birds on the basis of the quinarian system.  - William Sharp Macleay or McLeay (21 July 1792  26 January 1865) was a British civil servant and entomologist.  - Johann Jakob Kaup ( April 10 , 1803 - July 4 , 1873 ) was a German naturalist . A proponent of natural philosophy , he believed in an innate mathematical order in nature and he attempted biological classifications based on the Quinarian system .  - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?  - Johann Jakob Kaup (10 April 1803  4 July 1873) was a German naturalist. A proponent of natural philosophy, he believed in an innate mathematical order in nature and he attempted biological classifications based on the Quinarian system. Biography. He was born at Darmstadt. After studying at Göttingen and Heidelberg he spent two years at Leiden, where his attention was specially devoted to the amphibians and fishes. He then returned to Darmstadt as an assistant in the grand ducal museum, of which in 1840 he became inspector. In 1829 he published \\"Skizze zur Entwickelungsgeschichte der europäischen Thierwelt\\", in which he regarded the animal world as developed from lower to higher forms, from the amphibians through the birds to the beasts of prey; but subsequently he repudiated this work as a youthful indiscretion, and on the publication of Darwin's \\"Origin of Species\\" he declared himself against its doctrines. The extensive fossil deposits in the neighbourhood of Darmstadt gave him ample opportunities for palaeontological inquiries, and he gained considerable reputation by his \\"Beiträge zur näheren Kenntniss der urweltlichen Säugethiere\\" (18551862). He also wrote \\"Classification der Säugethiere und Vögel\\" (1844), and, with Heinrich Georg Bronn, \\"Die Gavial-artigen Reste aus dem Lias\\" (18421844).  - The Quinarian system was a method of zoological classification which had a brief period of popularity in the mid 19th century, especially among British naturalists. It was largely developed by the entomologist William Sharp MacLeay in 1819. The system was further promoted in the works of Nicholas Aylward Vigors, William John Swainson and Johann Jakob Kaup. Swainson's work on ornithology gave wide publicity to the idea. The system had opponents even before the publication of Charles Darwin's \\"On the Origin of Species\\" (1859 ) which paved the way for evolutionary trees.  - Natural philosophy or philosophy of nature (from Latin \\"philosophia naturalis\\") was the philosophical study of nature and the physical universe that was dominant before the development of modern science.

Article: Most people are aware of what the adoption process is because it has become rather common in our society. Adoption is where a child is legally placed with guardians   or parents (or perhaps a single parent) other than the birth mother or father. Once an adoption is finalized, all parental rights are turned over to the adoptive parents and there is no legal difference between adoptive parents and natural birth parents. There are generally two types of adoption, which are closed adoption and open adoption. When an adopted person has access to his or her adoption file and original records, it is referred to as an open adoption. The term is also used to describe any contact that may be between the adoptive family, the birth parents, and the adopted child. The level of openness can change greatly in such contact depending on each individual relationship. There can be indirect contact between the natural birth parents and the child through the form of letters and photographs, or there can be actual physical contact. A semi-open adoption is where the birth parents may have contact with the adoptive parents before the birth of the child, either once or several times. After the birth there is no more contact. A semi-open adoption may remain as it is or it can become either open or closed. A closed adoption is where only the medical and historical information about the biological parents is given to the adoptive family. Typically, the birth and adoptive parents do not know each other's identities. The record of the birth parents is kept sealed  . A closed adoption is usually only effective in the adoption of babies. The adoption of an older child who already knows his or her birth parents cannot be kept closed. Question: How many adoption types are mentioned in the passage? Options: A: 2. B: 3. C: 4. D: 5.

Article:The think tank weighed up the benefits of staying in the single market compared with membership of the World Trade Organization alone. The UK voted to leave the EU in the June referendum. Paul Johnson, IFS director, said there was a big difference between access and membership of the single market. \\"We've heard a lot of people saying of course we'll have access if we leave the single market union. \\"Broadly speaking, yes, we will, as every other country in the world does. You can export into the EU wherever you are from, but there are different sorts of barriers to doing so.\\" The IFS report said access to the single market was \\"virtually meaningless as a concept\\" because \\"any country in the World Trade Organization - from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe - had 'access' to the EU as an export destination\\". Five models for post-Brexit UK trade Who has access to the single market? The IFS report argued that the special advantage of being an EU member was that its single market reduced or eliminated barriers to trading in services, such as the need for licences or other regulations. The IFS said that the absence of trade barriers for services was far more important than removing tariffs on the trade in goods between EU members, such as customs checks and import taxes. It said that while leaving the EU would free the UK from having to make a budgetary contribution of Â£8bn, loss of trade could depress tax receipts by a larger amount. It found new trade deals would be unlikely to make up for lost EU trade, which accounts for 44% of British exports and 39% of service exports. The government has yet to start negotiating the UK's departure. The IFS issued stark warnings over the impact of Brexit ahead of the EU referendum, which have made some question its views. Mr Johnson said he hoped the IFS was proved wrong. \\"We wait to see what the economic consequences are going to be, but we've already seen the Bank of England significantly reduce its predictions of growth over the next couple of years and increase its view of where unemployment will be,\\" he added. The report said UK services would be particularly vulnerable if the government were unable or unwilling to negotiate a replacement deal and become a member of the European Economic Area (EEA), like Norway. The IFS report added that financial services, which generate 8% of the UK's economic output, might suffer in particular if a final Brexit deal meant they lost their so-called \\"passporting rights\\" that allows them to be sold directly to EU customers and businesses. \\"To maintain these rights would likely require membership of the European Economic Area (EEA),\\" it said. \\"But that would come at the potentially considerable cost of submitting to future regulations designed in the EU without input from the UK. The UK may have to make some very difficult choices between the benefits from passporting and the costs of submitting to external imposed regulation.\\" The IFS explored the possibility of the UK signing its own free trade agreement with the EU, or simply adopting WTO rules. But in both cases, the report argued, such deals would still involve tariffs or other barriers to free trade in goods and services. Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has warned that the UK could face serious consequences if it opts for a \\"hard Brexit\\" and leaves the EU single market, with reduced access negatively affecting trade and UK economic growth. The IFS emphasised the importance of the single market in reducing or eliminating barriers to trading services, which make up 44% of British exports and 39% of service exports. Financial services could be specifically affected if passporting rights are lost, hindering their ability to be sold directly to EU customers and businesses. The IFS noted that new trade agreements are unlikely to make up for lost EU trade and could lead to a drop in tax receipts larger than the cancellation of the UK's £8 billion budgetary contributions to the EU."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She was a member of the European People's Party and the Christian Democratic Appeal Party. During her tenure as an MEP, one of her focuses was on improving pension systems across the European Union. The report on adequate, sustainable, and secure European pension systems aims to address the challenges faced by the pension systems in the European Union's member countries. It proposes a number of measures to ensure that these systems are financially sustainable and provide adequate support to retirees. Some key recommendations of the report include: 1. Encouraging higher employment rates, particularly among older workers, as well as increasing the effective retirement age, in order to support the financial stability of pension systems. This can be achieved through targeted incentives and policies. 2. Ensuring that pension systems are sufficiently funded and that the investments made by pension funds are managed prudently and transparently. 3. Strengthening the link between contributions and benefits, so that those who have contributed more to their pension funds can expect to receive higher benefits upon retirement. 4. Promoting greater harmonization and coordination across different European pension systems, in order to improve pension portability and make it easier for citizens to move and work across the European Union. 5. Encouraging member countries to develop and implement more efficient and effective ways of delivering pension benefits, such as through the digitalization of services and the simplification of administrative processes. 6. Protecting the rights and interests of beneficiaries, ensuring that pension funds are adequately regulated and supervised, and promoting the development of consumer protection measures, including clear and transparent information for pension savers. Overall, the report on adequate, sustainable, and secure European pension systems aims to provide a comprehensive roadmap for the improvement of pension systems across the EU member countries. It calls for concerted action on the part of national governments and European institutions to ensure that these systems are well-equipped to face the challenges of an ageing population and that they can provide a high level of support and financial security to European citizens as they enter retirement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The growing field of \\"music treatment\\" is presenting increasing amounts of proof that point to the great powers of music. Emotional  benefits The right song can put anybody in a better state. Most people turn to certain songs to make them feel better. The main reason behind this is that music can express our feelings better than any other medium. In addition, we have favorite songs for particular situations because we turn to the music which has the best effect on us. Music and exercise Have you ever noticed how out of breath you get when listening to an exciting song while doing exercises at the gym? It has been suggested that exciting music can actually increase muscle tension  , while light music does the opposite. It has also been proved that music can improve motor skills. An experiment done on a group of pupils proved that children learning basic motor skills such as throwing ,catching and jumping while listening to music did better than those with no music.

What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  Your thermostat sends a signal to your heating system to provide heat for your home - When your oil burner is engaged, heating oil travels from the tank to the burner by way of a pump - Here the oil becomes a fine mist mixed with air - The fuel/air mixture is then injected into the burner where it is ignited in the combustion chamber - The warm air is disbursed through vents, hot water through baseboards, or by steam radiators - Answer:","output":"The missing first step of the process is:  1. The temperature in your home drops below the set point on your thermostat. To give a more detailed and fuller understanding of the whole heating process, here's a breakdown of the steps: 1. The temperature in your home drops below the set point on your thermostat: When the temperature inside your home becomes lower than the desired level set on your thermostat, the thermostat detects this change and activates the heating process. 2. Your thermostat sends a signal to your heating system to provide heat for your home: Once the thermostat detects the temperature drop, it sends an electrical signal to the heating system, indicating that it needs to turn on and start generating heat. 3. When your oil burner is engaged, heating oil travels from the tank to the burner by way of a pump: As the heating system is activated, a pump pulls heating oil from the storage tank and sends it to the oil burner, preparing it for the combustion process. 4. Here the oil becomes a fine mist mixed with air: Before the heating oil enters the combustion chamber, it is transformed into a fine mist by an atomizing nozzle. This process allows for more efficient combustion, as the oil is mixed with air to create a fuel/air mixture. 5. The fuel/air mixture is then injected into the burner where it is ignited in the combustion chamber: The fine mist of heating oil and air is sprayed into the combustion chamber, where it is ignited by a spark or a hot surface. This combustion generates heat, which is then transferred to the air or water that will be circulated throughout your home. 6. The warm air is disbursed through vents, hot water through baseboards, or by steam radiators: Depending on the heating system in your home, the heat generated by the oil burner is transferred to the air or water used for space heating. If your home uses a forced-air system, the heated air is distributed through vents or ducts. If you have a hydronic (hot water) system, the hot water circulates through baseboards or radiators. Finally, if your home uses a steam radiator system, the steam produced by the heating process is sent to the radiators to release heat into the rooms. Ensuring that the temperature in your home is comfortable and consistent involves a sequence of carefully coordinated steps. Understanding these steps can help you manage and maintain your heating system more effectively, keeping your home warm and your energy expenses in check."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Logan earns more money per year than Brian because  Select from: (i) Logan has an extremely well-paying job.; (ii) Brian has an extremely well-paying job.; Answer:","output":"Logan earns more money per year than Brian because Logan has an extremely well-paying job. Having a well-paying job often means that an individual has pursued a career in a high-demand, specialized, or competitive field, which in turn has led them to secure a position with a significantly higher salary than those in other professions. In Logan's case, his dedication, hard work, and acquired skills have granted him the opportunity to land an extraordinarily lucrative role, resulting in an annual income surpassing that of Brian. On the other hand, even though Brian may also have a well-paying job, the income he earns annually does not exceed that of Logan. Brian's career path might involve less specialization or lower market demand for his skills, which could partly explain the discrepancy in their earnings. Additionally, factors like experience, education, and specific job responsibilities can contribute to the variation in their income levels. Nevertheless, it's essential to consider that earning a significant income is not the sole measure of one's success or happiness. Both Logan and Brian may derive satisfaction and a sense of accomplishment from their respective professions, regardless of the difference in monetary compensation. Furthermore, one must take into account external factors affecting these individuals' work-life balance, such as job security, benefits, and overall job satisfaction. It's possible that both Logan and Brian have made respective career choices based on personal values, interests, and goals – not simply by the financial rewards they receive.

Answer this question: n which country was the game chinese checkers invented??","output":"Chinese Checkers, despite its name, was not invented in China nor is it historically linked to traditional Chinese culture. The game was actually invented in Germany. Chinese Checkers is a modern version of an older game called Halma, which was developed in the late 19th century by an American named George Howard Monks. Halma is a board game played on a square or diamond-shaped board with 16 spaces on each side. The goal of the game is to move all of one's pieces from their starting corner to the opposite corner before the other player does the same. In 1892, a German company called Ravensburger introduced a more simplified version of Halma called \\"Stern-Halma,\\" which translates to \\"Star-Halma.\\" This version of the game featured a star-shaped board, making it faster and easier to play compared to its predecessor. Stern-Halma became highly popular across Europe, and soon reached the United States under the name \\"Chinese Checkers\\" — a complete rebranding to make the game more marketable and exotic. Apart from being called Chinese Checkers, there is no direct influence or connection between the game and Chinese culture or history. The game only retains its name in an attempt to attract consumers and to create an air of mystique around its origins, which has led many to mistakenly believe that it was indeed created in China. To summarize, Chinese Checkers was invented in Germany, as an adaptation of the American game Halma.

First, we combine all the constants on one side of the equation and the variables on the other side.  Let's simplify the constant on the left side: -163362 + 89774 = -73688 And the constants on the right side: 172678 + 628454 = 801132 So the equation becomes:  -73688 = -6160*s + 801132 We'll then subtract 801132 from both sides to isolate -6160*s on the right side: -73688 - 801132 = -6160*s Which simplifies to: -874820 = -6160*s Then divide both sides by -6160 to find s: s = -874820 / -6160 Solving the division gives us: s = 142 Therefore, the solution to the equation -163362 + 89774 = -6160*s + 172678 + 628454 for s is s = 142."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As more clouds form overhead, it is expected that the grass will grow faster. This phenomenon can be considered as indirectly impacting a step of the process. The direct impact of the rain is clearly visible when talking about the steps involving the wood; rain falling on the wood, seeping into its surface, permeating the wood, and affecting its finish. However, the grass growing faster, while it may be related to the overall weather conditions, is not directly involved in the process of the wood losing its luster or paint. So, despite not being directly related to the process specified, the grass growing faster can be considered as an indirect perturbation for the following reasons: 1. The faster-growing grass indicates increased levels of moisture and precipitation. This increased moisture in the environment may contribute to the wood being subject to more rainwater exposure, further exacerbating the issue. 2. The growth rate of grass may indirectly influence the rate at which the wood is exposed to and affected by different weather conditions. The more grass grows, the higher the likelihood of trapping additional moisture in the area, which could accelerate the effect of the rain on the wood.

Load testing is a critical aspect of software testing that focuses on verifying the performance, reliability, and stability of an application or system under a specified amount of load.  In more detail, load testing is essential for determining how a software system will perform under real-world conditions such as high traffic, large data volumes, and multiple simultaneous users. The goal of load testing is to identify potential bottlenecks or performance issues that may impact the end-user experience and ensure that the system is optimized to handle the expected workloads. Load testing typically involves the following processes: 1. Requirements gathering: To get started, it is crucial to gather and understand the performance requirements and objectives of an application, which may include metrics like response times, throughput, and resource utilization. 2. Test planning: In this phase, testers create a detailed plan to load-test the application, including the selection of testing tools, identification of test scenarios, definition of test data requirements, and identification of performance acceptance criteria. 3. Test design: Testers design realistic test scenarios that mimic actual user behavior, data volumes, and concurrent users to ensure that the tests cover different aspects of the system's performance under load. This may include parameterized test scripts and automation scripts for simulating users. 4. Test execution: Using load testing tools, testers inject simulated user loads and run performance tests based on the designed test scenarios. Testers monitor the system's behavior and response during the tests, collecting various performance metrics such as response time, throughput, and error rates. 5. Results analysis: After running the tests, testers analyze the results to identify bottlenecks, resource constraints, or other issues impacting performance. They may use various performance monitoring tools and visualizations to interpret the collected data for more in-depth analysis. 6. Optimization and tuning: Based on the findings from the analysis, the development team makes necessary changes to the system - such as optimizing code, fine-tuning server configurations, or addressing architectural flaws - to improve performance under load. 7. Re-testing: After making improvements and optimizations, testers conduct load testing again to validate that the changes yield the desired performance improvements and meet the established acceptance criteria. In conclusion, load testing is an essential method for testing software under a specific load, as it allows developers and testers to ensure the system is robust, stable, and performs well under real-world conditions with large quantities of data or a large number of users."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Would trail B be shorter or longer than trail A?  David is an entomologist. He recently got interested in ants and their behaviors. To that end, he studied a group of ants, which be labeled as case A. To compare ants with other ant like creatures he studied another hymenopteran group, which he labeled as case B. Moreover, he noticed two distinct trails made by the ants, trail A or trail B. Trail A was followed by many ants, but trail B was abandoned by them.  Hint: Ants communicate with each other using pheromones, sounds, and touch. The use of pheromones as chemical signals is more developed in ants, such as the red harvester ant, than in other hymenopteran groups. Like other insects, ants perceive smells with their long, thin, and mobile antennae. The paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents. Since most ants live on the ground, they use the soil surface to leave pheromone trails that may be followed by other ants. In species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail on the way back to the colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. When the food source is exhausted, no new trails are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. This behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. For instance, when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes. If an ant is successful, it leaves a new trail marking the shortest route on its return. Successful trails are followed by more ants, reinforcing better routes and gradually identifying the best path.Ants use pheromones for more than just making trails. A crushed ant emits an alarm pheromone that sends nearby ants into an attack frenzy and attracts more ants from farther away. Several ant species even use \\"propaganda pheromones\\" to confuse enemy ants and make them fight among themselves. Pheromones are produced by a wide range of structures including Dufour's glands, poison glands and glands on the hindgut, pygidium, rectum, sternum, and hind tibia. Pheromones also are exchanged, mixed with food, and passed by trophallaxis, transferring information within the colony. This allows other ants to detect what task group (e.g., foraging or nest maintenance) other colony members belong to. In ant species with queen castes, when the dominant queen stops producing a specific pheromone, workers begin to... Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it is not explicitly mentioned whether trail B would be shorter or longer than trail A. However, we can deduce some information about the trails from the ants' behavior and their use of pheromones. Ants communicate using pheromones and mark trails leading to food sources. When a forager ant discovers a food source, it marks a trail for other ants to follow. This trail is then reinforced by other ants returning with food, making the trail stronger. Once the food source is exhausted, the ants stop marking the trail, and the scent dissipates. When an obstacle blocks an established trail, ants explore new routes to the food source, marking the shortest route they find. In the given case, trail A was followed by many ants, and trail B was abandoned by them. It is possible that trail B was initially established as a path to a food source, but later the food source was either exhausted or blocked by an obstacle. The ants then stopped marking and reinforcing the trail. On the other hand, trail A might still have a viable food source, explaining the preference of ants for this trail. The ants' behavior of marking the shortest route back to the colony when they find a new path after encountering an obstacle could suggest that trail A is shorter than trail B. However, this is not definitive, as the situation might be more complex. To summarize, it is not explicitly mentioned whether trail B is shorter or longer than trail A, but based on the ants' behavior and their use of pheromones, it could be inferred that trail A might be shorter or more efficient in terms of reaching a viable food source. However, without more context and details, we cannot provide a definitive answer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Movie title: Eden Log Movie plot: A man wakes up disoriented, deep inside an underground cave. Suffering amnesia, he has no recollection of who he is, or how he got there. A dead man lies next to him. As he stumbles around in the limited light, he comes upon a dilapidated area with damaged pieces of technology all around him. A registration plays, explaining the place is a sort of processing network called Eden Log, whose workers are all immigrants promised citizenship in the society above ground. The workers are apparently harvesting the sap of a gigantic plant whose roots and vines are now everywhere in the underground complex, which appears abandoned. While trying to reach the surface, the man comes upon a bearded stranger pinned against the wall by the protruding vines that are slowly taking over his body. The stranger, in great pain and sounding deranged, tells the man he's the creator of that entire system, and then warns him about an unseen menace. A growling noise approaches and the man loses consciousness. Upon waking up, the man keeps going up, passing throughout areas increasingly better-lit. He retrieves more recordings, revealing that one of the network technicians refused to give access to security personnel. It becomes clear that some kind of revolt was started by the workers over the conditions in the network. As a result, the corporate overlords ordered the security forces to forcibly take control of the network levels and seal the area.

Bach structured the cantata in eight movements: an instrumental sinfonia and seven vocal movements corresponding to the stanzas of the hymn. The duration is given as 22 minutes.The title of the original parts of the first Leipzig performance is (in Johann Christoph Altnickol's handwriting): \\"Feria Paschatos / Christ lag in Todes Banden / a.4. Voc: / Cornetto / 3 Trombon. / 2 Violini / 2 Viole / con / Continuo / Di Sign. Joh.Seb.Bach\\", In this late version, Bach scored the work for four vocal parts (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T), and bass (B)), and a Baroque instrumental ensemble consisting of strings, brass and continuo. The brass parts, a choir of cornetto (Ct) and three trombones (Tb) playing colla parte with the voices at times, may have been added in the 1720s. They may also possibly represent the original scoring, in the style of the 17th-century polychoral tradition.The scoring of the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden has been described as \\"archaic\\" and its style \\"medieval\\": The string section consists of two violin parts (Vl) and two viola parts (VA); this indicates an older practice as for instance found in 17th-century church cantatas by Bach's ancestors (see Altbachisches Archiv), and in Jesus Christus ist um unsrer Missetat willen verwundet, a Passion setting from the early 18th century (or older) which Bach had performed a few years after composing the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden. In the first half of the 18th century the standard for a string section soon evolved to two violin parts, one viola part and continuo. The cornett used in the cantata was an instrument that belonged to an earlier age: by the second quarter of the 18th century it had almost entirely disappeared from Bach's compositions. The brass instruments were only used for the 1 April 1725 version of the work.  The other performances (24 April 1707, 8 April 1708, and 9 April 1724) were performed without brass instruments (i.e., Cornetto and three Trombones).

Woodes Rogers spent part of his childhood in Poole, England, where he likely attended the local school; his father, who owned shares in many ships, was often away nine months of the year with the Newfoundland fishing fleet. Sometime between 1690 and 1696, Captain Rogers moved his family to Bristol. In November 1697, Woodes Rogers was apprenticed to Bristol mariner John Yeamans, to learn the profession of a sailor. The ships then went to the Dutch port of Batavia in what is now Indonesia, where Rogers underwent surgery to remove a musket ball from the roof of his mouth, and the expedition disposed of the less seaworthy of the two Spanish prizes. Dealing with the Dutch there constituted a violation of the British East India Company's monopoly. When the ships finally dropped anchor in the Thames River on 14 October 1711, a legal battle ensued, with the investors paying the East India Company PS6,000 (about PS820,000 at today's values) as settlement for their claim for breach of monopoly, about four percent of what Rogers brought back. The investors approximately doubled their money, while Rogers gained PS1,600 (now worth perhaps PS218,700) from a voyage which disfigured him and cost him his brother, who was killed in a battle in the Pacific. The money was probably less than he could have made at home, and was entirely absorbed by the debts his family had incurred in his absence. However, the long voyage and the capture of the Spanish ship made Rogers a national hero. Rogers was the first Englishman, in circumnavigating the globe, to have his original ships and most of his crew survive.  After his voyage, he wrote an account of it, titled A Cruising Voyage Round the World. Edward Cooke, an officer aboard Duchess, also wrote a book, A Voyage to the South Sea and Round the World, and beat Rogers to print by several months. Rogers' book was much more successful, with many readers fascinated by the account of Selkirk's rescue, which Cooke had slighted. Among those interested in Selkirk's adventure was Daniel Defoe, who appears to have read about it, and fictionalised the story as Robinson Crusoe.  While Rogers' book enjoyed financial success, it had a practical purpose--to aid British navigators and possible colonists. Much of Rogers' introduction is devoted to advocacy for the South Seas trade. Rogers notes that had there been a British colony in the South Seas, he would not have had to worry about food supplies for his crew. A third of Rogers' book is devoted to detailed descriptions of the places that he explored, with special emphasis on \\"such [places] as may be of most use for enlarging our trade\\". He describes the area of the River Plate in detail because it lay \\"within the limits of the South Sea Company\\", whose schemes had not yet burst into financial scandal. Rogers' book was carried by such South Pacific navigators as Admiral George Anson and privateering captains John Clipperton and George Shelvocke.

Article: On the bus, on the subway, every head is lowered to a cell phone, iPad, or other digital device. But does this mean more and more people are getting into reading the digital way? According to the National Reading Survey, before the 17thWorld Reading Day on April 23, only 1.2 percent of Chinese people said they read a lot. But 38.6 percent said they read on digital devices like cell phone and e-books. This is a 17.7 percent increase from 2010. Many experts are talking about a trend toward fragmented reading --reading many short messages or items on a digital device like a cell phone instead of one long text in a book. Zhao jianmin, a professor at Shanghai University, said fragmented reading was part of modern life. \\"The fast _ of life leaves many people no time to sit and read a whole book,\\" he said. \\"So making use of fragmented time to read is sure to be a trend\\" Fragmented reading has its advantages. People can enjoy large amounts of information, knowledge and entertainment in a short time. Digital reading is faster than traditional deep reading. However, some experts fear the trend of digital reading will lead people to read in a simple way. Xu Guosheng, at a Chinese Academy of Press and Publication, says fragmented reading makes it harder for people to think more about what they read. He also warned fragmented reading could make people lazy about remembering facts because they know they can always just search for answers online. \\"Fragmented reading is sometimes good, but don't let it take all your time,\\" suggested Tian Zhilng, an editor. He said it was important to read quality books in a deeper way, and we should read for knowledge, for practical use and for pleasure. He suggested people choose easy books first, then move onto more difficult ones. Question: What is the main idea of the article? Options: A: The results of a national reading survey.

Article: Everyone's at it, even my neighbors. I thought I might be the only person left in the world who hadn't done an eBay deal. So I decided to try my hand at online auction. Buying for beginners: Sign up on www.eBay.co.uk. Most items (e.g. tables, computers, and books) ready for auction will come with a picture and a short description; others may be marked with \\"Buy It Now\\" and have a fixed price. You can buy these right away. If the item is being auctioned, you offer the highest price you are prepared to pay and eBay bids for you.The bid will be increased little by little until it goes beyond your highest bid, then you are emailed and asked if you would like to bid again. Auctions last up to 10 days, and when they finish you get an email telling you whether you have won the item. How to pay: Sellers decide how they would like to be paid and you need to check this before placing a bid as you might not want to post a cheque or postal orders. The easiest way is through PayPal, an online payment system that takes the money away from your credit card. Selling made simple: If you plan to sell on eBay, it helps to include a picture of the item.I followed my friends' advice and put up the items I wanted to sell for a 10-day auction, starting on a Thursday.This way buyers had two weekends to bid. The big things in life: It's easy to post a small item, but furniture is a big part of eBay and this has to be collected or sent by delivery men.Check the ways of delivery before you bid.

Among them is British journalist David Frost, currently recording a talk show in Australia, who decides to interview Nixon. Nixonâs literary agent, Irving \\"Swifty\\" Lazar, believes the interview would be an opportunity for Nixon to salvage his reputation, and to make some money. Nixon ultimately demands 600,000, and Frost accepts. After persuading his friend and producer John Birt that the interviews would be a success, Frost and Birt travel to California to meet with Nixon. On the plane to California, Frost flirts with a young woman called Caroline Cushing, and they begin a relationship. Frost struggles to sell the interviews to U.S. networks, and decides to finance the project with private money and syndicate the broadcast of the interviews. He hires two investigators â Bob Zelnick and James Reston Jr. â to help him prepare, along with Birt. Frost is not clear on what he wants from the interview, and Reston encourages him to aim for a confession from Nixon. Under the watchful eye of Nixon's post-presidential chief of staff, Jack Brennan, Frost and Nixon embark on the first three recording sessions. Restricted by an agreed-upon timeframe and under pressure from his own team to ask the tough questions, Frost struggles to get a word in as Nixon dominates with lengthy and self-serving monologues, fencing ably on Vietnam and boasting about his achievements in foreign policy.

Four days before the final session, which will center on Watergate, Frost receives a phonecall from an inebriated Nixon.

Given the question: Information:  - A hobby is a regular activity that is done for enjoyment, typically during one's leisure time. Hobbies can include collecting themed items and objects, engaging in creative and artistic pursuits, playing sports, or pursuing other amusements. A list of hobbies is lengthy and always changing as interests and fashions change. By continually participating in a particular hobby, one can acquire substantial skill and knowledge in that area. Engagement in hobbies has increased since the late nineteenth century as workers have more leisure time and advancing production and technology have provided more support for leisure activities. As some hobbies have become less popular, like stamp collecting, others have been created following technological advances, like video games.  - Model building as a hobby involves the creation of models either from kits or from materials and components acquired by the builder . Categories of modelling include : Scale model building Live steam models Matchstick models Military models Model aircraft Model cars Model commercial vehicles Model construction vehicles Building models Architectural models Model figures Model military vehicles Rail transport modelling Model rockets Model ships Freelance model Cardboard engineering Firearm models ( See Airsoft guns ) Gundam Models  - The hobby of collecting includes seeking, locating, acquiring, organizing, cataloging, displaying, storing, and maintaining whatever items are of interest to the individual collector. The scope of collecting is unlimited: \\"If something exists, somebody somewhere collects them.\\"  - Leisure has been defined as a quality of experience or as free time.  - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.  - Stamp collecting is the collecting of postage stamps and related objects. It is related to philately which is the study of stamps. It has been one of the world's most popular hobbies since the late nineteenth century with the rapid growth of the postal service, but is now in decline with the rise of the internet which has sharply reduced the number of postal items arriving in households. Stamp collecting proved to be an almost perfect hobby for collectors because there was a never ending stream of new stamps as each country sought to advertise its distinctiveness through its stamps. Because some stamps became rare, a thriving international trade in stamps was created. While stamp collectors are of all ages, it has been particularly popular hobby among children, many of whom continued the hobby as adults.

Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla.  - Morocco (', lit. \\"The West\\"; '), officially known as the Kingdom of Morocco (', lit. \\"The Western Kingdom\\"; '), is a sovereign country located in the Maghreb region of North Africa. Geographically, Morocco is characterized by a rugged mountainous interior, large tracts of desert, and a lengthy coastline along the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea.  - The Saadi dynasty or Saadian dynasty (Arabic: , \\"as-saadin\\"; Berber: , \\"Isdiyen\\"; original name Bani Zaydan) was a dynasty that ruled Morocco from 1549 to 1659.  - Zidan Abu Maali (?  September 1627) was the embattled Sultan of Morocco from 1603 to 1627, ruling only over the southern half of the country after, his brother took the northern half and a Sanhaji rebel from Tafilalt (Ahmed ibn Abi Mahalli) marched on Marrakesh claiming to be the Mahdi. All of which exacerbated by, a context of chaos that ensued a plague pandemic which left a third of the country dead, the end of the Anglo-Spanish war (Treaty of London (1604)) which broke the Anglo-Dutch axis that Morocco was relying upon as a means of protection from Spain, and so caused the Spanish navy to resume devastating raids on the Moroccan coast and the rebellion of one of his provincial governors who established his own independent republic between Azemmour and Salé. He was the son and appointed hair of Ahmad al-Mansur, and resided mostly in Safi where he became encircled after being driven out of Marrakesh and failed military campaigns against the rebellious brother in the north.  - Ahmad I al-Mansur (also El-Mansour Eddahbi [the Golden], ; and Ahmed el-Mansour; 1549 in Fes  25 August 1603, outskirts of Fes) was Sultan of the Saadi dynasty from 1578 to his death in 1603, the sixth and most famous of all rulers of the Saadis. Ahmad al-Mansur was an important figure in both Europe and Africa in the sixteenth century, his powerful army and strategic location made him an important power player in the late Renaissance period.  - Abu Faris Abdallah , nicknamed al - Wathik Billah ( 1564 -- 1608 ) was a ruler of the Saadi dynasty . He was one of the three sons of Ahmad al - Mansur and reigned in different parts of the country ( 1603 -- 1608 ) , the South , Marrakesh and Fez . He especially fought his brother Zidan Abu Maali ( r. 1603 -- 1627 ) .  - Sultan (') is a noble title with several historical meanings. Originally, it was an Arabic abstract noun meaning \\"strength\\", \\"authority\\", \\"rulership\\", derived from the verbal noun ', meaning \\"authority\\" or \\"power\\".

He identified three planets, planet A, planet B and planet C. Little did he know that less than a hundred years ago people used to call planet A as Earth, planet B as Venus, and planet C as Mercury.  Which planet would have lower pressure on the surface, planet A or planet B?  Hint: Clouds on Earth are made of water vapor. Venus's clouds are a lot less pleasant. They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury. Temperatures at the surface reach 465°C (860°F). That’s hot enough to melt lead! Answer:","output":"To determine which planet has lower pressure on the surface between planet A and planet B, let's examine the given information. 1. Planet A (Earth) has clouds made of water vapor. 2. Planet B (Venus) has clouds made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid. 3.

You could get all existential about your life, but that won't get you anywhere. Instead, put your mind to something and do it. The action of getting something done will show you that you can overcome challenges, and make you feel capable, useful, and worthwhile. It can be anything. Run a 10k. Overcome your shyness. Become a wine connoisseur. Whatever you can see yourself enjoying for a long time will be worth your while. But remember: the harder it is, the bigger the payoff. Losing 5 pounds is great, but losing 10 might make you feel twice as good. This is similar to the previous step. But mastering something, becoming a true expert, will give you a sense of identity, knowledge, and a great feeling of internal satisfaction. Whatever you're good at now, throw yourself into 150%. The payoff will be unimaginable. When you become an expert, you know you're truly good at something. There is no room for doubt, no room for negativity. This can become a haven of positivity, reassurance, and relaxation. And, inevitably, it'll be a part of your everyday life. So if you've been hiding the fact that you play the bagpipes for 8 years now, let 'er out. This is also similar to the last two steps -- in fact, they can all be intertwined. Your resolution could be to become a painter. But back to the point -- creating something is so validating, especially in today's world. We walk through turning on lights with  the flick of a switch, talking to people through screens, and sitting down as we scoot down the highway. Everything is done for us. Create something yourself and you become one of the few who are resourceful, knowledgeable, and tuned in. Once more, it doesn't matter what it is. Sure, a new irrigation system for the Congo would be super great for the world at large, but making a duct tape bag gets you thinking creatively, too. What can you do with your set of talents and skills? This doesn't work for everyone, but it could work for you. Ever gone on a run and felt a thousand times better after (or three times better)? That's it. That's the feeling. Putting your body to work might get your brain on the right track. It's too easy to get cooped up at the office and consider the 20-foot walk into Starbucks to be your daily gallivant with nature. Go for a walk. Get outside. Feel the sun. You'll wake up, you'll feel more energized, and you'll feel more mentally energized. Old habits may be impossible to erase from your brain, but they aren’t impossible to break. Instead of trying to eradicate old habits, develop healthier, stronger alternatives that bypass the old ones. Developing new habits takes time, but once they are established, they’re with you for life.  Do some exercise! Go swimming and try a dive that you have never done before.

Originally setting his sights on the Indianapolis 500, Cole realizes that \\"To win in Indy I'd need a great car, but stock cars are all the same\\". He is recruited by Chevrolet dealership tycoon Tim Daland to race for his team in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series. Daland brings former crew chief and car builder Harry Hogge out of retirement to lead Cole's pit crew. After Cole sets a fast time in a private test at Charlotte Motor Speedway, Hogge builds him a new Chevrolet Lumina. In his first few races, Cole has difficulty adjusting to the larger NASCAR stock cars and communicating with his crew, while being intimidated on the track by Winston Cup Champion and dirty driver Rowdy Burns; these obstacles, combined with crashes and blown engines, prevent Cole from finishing the races. Discovering that Cole does not understand common NASCAR terminology, Harry puts him through rigorous training. This pays off at the Darlington race, when Cole uses a slingshot maneuver from the outside line to overtake Rowdy and win his first race.

It appeared in the late Devonian period (Famennian age) about 365 million years ago, and was anatomically intermediate between lobe-finned fishes and those that were fully capable of coming onto land.  - The Carboniferous is a geologic period and system that spans 60 million years from the end of the Devonian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Permian Period, Mya. The name \\"Carboniferous\\" means \\"coal-bearing\\" and derives from the Latin words \\"carb\\" (\\"coal\\") and \\"fer\\" (\\"I bear, I carry\\"), and was coined by geologists William Conybeare and William Phillips in 1822. Based on a study of the British rock succession, it was the first of the modern 'system' names to be employed, and reflects the fact that many coal beds were formed globally during that time. The Carboniferous is often treated in North America as two geological periods, the earlier Mississippian and the later Pennsylvanian.  - Eogyrinus attheyi ( from Greek eos , meaning \`\` dawn '' , and gyrinos , meaning \`\` tadpole '' ) was one of the largest Carboniferous tetrapods , and perhaps one of the largest of its family , Eogyrinidae , at 4.6 metres ( 15 ft ) in length . Eogyrinus appears to have been a powerful swimmer that moved quickly through the water by swishing its long tail from side to side . It may have been a predator , lying in wait for prey in much the same way as a modern crocodile . It was a lightly built animal , weighing around 560 kilograms ( 1,230 lb ) . Although probably better at hunting in the water , Eogyrinus could probably have also made a grab for prey passing close by on land . Fossils of Eogyrinus are known from northern England . Recent studies by Jennifer A. Clack suggest that the amphibian Pholiderpeton described by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1869 is the same animal as Eogyrinus . If this is so , then Pholiderpeton 's name takes priority .  - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.  - The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present.  - Eogyrinidae is an extinct family of large, long-bodied tetrapods that lived in the rivers of the Late Carboniferous period.    What is the relationship between 'eogyrinus' and 'genus'? A:","output":"Eogyrinus is a species within the Eogyrinidae family, and this family is a group within the superclass Tetrapoda.

In replacement phones, defects including welding issues and a lack of insulation were to blame, the company said. Samsung issued a recall last year after widely reported cases of the phone catching fire and exploding. It ended up axing its answer to the iPhone and losing around 5.3 billion. \\"The lessons of this incident are deeply reflected in our culture and process,\\" Samsung mobile chief Koh Dong-jing told reporters. \\"Samsung Electronics will be working hard to regain consumer trust,\\" Koh said.

Write a text based on this summary: australian treasurer says current account deficit a wake up call Text:","output":"Title: Australian Treasurer Declares Current Account Deficit a Wake-Up Call In recent news, the Australian Treasurer has voiced concerns over the country's current account deficit. This economic issue has arisen as a wake-up call for the nation, urging policymakers and citizens to address structural and budgetary challenges in order to ensure long-term prosperity. The current account deficit, which represents a gap between the value of goods and services a country exports and the value of goods and services it imports, has dramatically widened in recent months. This deficit, coupled with a range of other economic indicators, highlights Australia's vulnerability and the urgent need for strong economic policy reforms. According to the Treasurer, one of the primary contributors to the current account deficit is a decline in export earnings, caused in part by the global economic slowdown and lower demand for Australian commodities. Additionally, Australia has been grappling with persistent trade deficits, diminishing investments, and lower productivity levels – all factors that have placed increased pressure on the nation's current account balance. Moreover, Australia's current account deficit has resulted in an increased reliance on foreign capital. This has the potential to compromise the country's financial stability, should global financial markets undergo a downturn or if investors lose confidence in Australia's economy. As a result, the Treasurer is urging the government to address these issues through strategic planning and policy implementation. Several steps have been proposed to tackle the current account deficit and associated economic challenges: 1. Boosting productivity – There is a pressing need to improve national productivity through investments in infrastructure, education, and skills development. By increasing productivity, Australia can strengthen its competitiveness in global markets and bolster export revenues. 2. Encouraging innovation – Supporting research and development in key sectors such as technology, agriculture, and energy can help Australia diversify its economy and reduce dependence on the commodities market. 3. Enhancing fiscal responsibility – The government should prioritize more efficient spending, reducing the budget deficit, and managing public debt to create a sound financial environment. 4. Focusing on domestic demand – Policymakers should take measures to encourage private sector investment and consumer spending, fostering sustainable economic growth that is less reliant on external factors. 5. Nurturing sustainable relationships – The government should pursue trade agreements and partnerships that create opportunities for economic cooperation and mutual growth with other countries. The Treasurer's remarks on the current account deficit reveal a sense of urgency within the Australian government to address these long-standing economic issues that have accumulated over time. By implementing policy changes and strategic initiatives that address productivity, innovation, fiscal responsibility, domestic demand, and international relationships, Australia can work towards rebalancing its current account and fostering an economy built on stable growth and prosperity. In conclusion, the Australian Treasurer's recent statement on the current account deficit serves as a wake-up call to the nation. The current economic situation is a warning signal that highlights the need for decisive action and a reevaluation of Australia's economic trajectory. It is essential that the government, policymakers, and citizens come together to address the challenges posed by the current account deficit and ensure a brighter economic future for Australia."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Elizabeth I forbid all religious plays in 1558 and the great cycle plays had been silenced by the 1580s. Similarly, religious plays were banned in the Netherlands in 1539, the Papal States in 1547 and in Paris in 1548. The abandonment of these plays destroyed the international theatre that had thereto existed and forced each country to develop its own form of drama. It also allowed dramatists to turn to secular subjects and the reviving interest in Greek and Roman theatre provided them with the perfect opportunity.\\",  answer the following question.

Some of the earliest recorded observations ever made through a telescope, Galileo's drawings on 28 December 1612 and 27 January 1613, contain plotted points that match up with what is now known to be the position of Neptune. On both occasions, Galileo seems to have mistaken Neptune for a fixed star when it appeared close—in conjunction—to Jupiter in the night sky; hence, he is not credited with Neptune's discovery. At his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day. This apparent backward motion is created when Earth's orbit takes it past an outer planet. Because Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small telescope. In July 2009, University of Melbourne physicist David Jamieson announced new evidence suggesting that Galileo was at least aware that the 'star' he had observed had moved relative to the fixed stars.

First, let's combine the terms with b (-446*b and -2362*b): -446*b - 2362*b = -2808*b. 2. Now, the equation will look like this: -2808*b - 92664 = 0. 3. We want to move the -92664 to the other side of the equation. To do this, we need to add 92664 to both sides: -2808*b = 92664. 4. Now, we need to find the value of b. To do this, we'll divide both sides by -2808: b = 92664 / -2808. 5. After calculation, we find that b is approximately equal to -33.

Here is a question about this article: However, in English, the term madrasah usually refers to the specifically Islamic institutions. A typical Islamic school usually offers two courses of study: a ḥifẓ course teaching memorization of the Qur'an (the person who commits the entire Qurʼan to memory is called a ḥāfiẓ); and an ʻālim course leading the candidate to become an accepted scholar in the community. A regular curriculum includes courses in Arabic, tafsir (Qur'anic interpretation), sharīʻah (Islamic law), hadiths (recorded sayings and deeds of Muhammad), mantiq (logic), and Muslim history. In the Ottoman Empire, during the Early Modern Period, the study of hadiths was introduced by Süleyman I. Depending on the educational demands, some madaris also offer additional advanced courses in Arabic literature, English and other foreign languages, as well as science and world history. Ottoman madaris along with religious teachings also taught \\"styles of writing, grammary, syntax, poetry, composition, natural sciences, political sciences, and etiquette.\\" What is the answer to this question: What is shariah?","output":"Shariah, also spelled as sharīʻah, is the Islamic law derived from the Quran (the holy book of Islam) and Hadiths (recorded sayings and deeds of Prophet Muhammad).

Write a question about the following article: Coming off their road win over the Panthers, the Cowboys closed out the regular season at FedExField in a Week 17 NFC East rematch with the Washington Redskins.  With the #1 seed already wrapped up, the Cowboys had little to play for and rested many of their starters in the 2nd half. In the first quarter, Dallas trailed early with Redskins RB Clinton Portis getting a 23-yard TD run for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, Washington increased its lead with kicker Shaun Suisham getting a 46-yard field goal.  The Cowboys would respond with rookie kicker Nick Folk getting a 37-yard field goal, but the Redskins replied with Suisham kicking a 21-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Washington continued to lead as Portis got a 1-yard TD run for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, the Redskins pulled away as QB Todd Collins completed a 42-yard TD pass to WR Santana Moss.  Dallas would end the game with Folk nailing a 30-yard field goal. With the loss, the Cowboys ended the regular season at 13-3, along with the NFC's #1 seed. The Cowboys secured a bye and home field advantage throughout the playoffs with an NFC best 13-3 regular season record. Fresh off a bye week, the #1 seed Cowboys hosted the #5 seed New York Giants in the Divisional round of the playoffs. The Giants were fresh off an upset win over the #4 seed Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Tampa Bay in the Wild Card round. It would be the third time the NFC East division rivals faced off against each other that season, with the Cowboys winning the previous two matchups. The Giants took the opening kickoff and came out firing, hitting the Cowboys with a quick 52 yard touchdown pass from Eli Manning to Amani Toomer. The Cowboys and Giants would exchange punts on the next 2 series before the Cowboy marched 96 yards down the field, scoring on a 5-yard touchdown pass from Tony Romo to Terrell Owens (which was reviewed and upheld), tying the score at 7-7. The Cowboys never faced a 3rd down on the drive. With the 2nd quarter underway, the Giants would punt on the next series, giving the ball to the Cowboys at their own 10 yard line with 11:21 left in the 2nd quarter. The Cowboys would proceed to march methodically down the field in small chunks, as they burned up all but 61 seconds of the clock before Marion Barber bulled into the end zone on a 1-yard touchdown run, making it 14-7 in the Cowboys favor (the play was reviewed but upheld). With just 61 seconds left in the half, the Giants seemed to catch the Cowboys' defense napping as they quickly marched down the field from their own 29 yard line, stunning the Cowboys with a 4-yard touchdown pass from Manning to Toomer with 11 seconds left in the half. It was Manning and Toomer's 2nd touchdown connection of the first half. The game went into halftime with the score tied at 14-14. The Cowboys took the opening kickoff, and much like their last drive in the first half, proceeded to march very slowly down the field, gaining yards in small chunks. After a drop by tight end Anthony Fasano in the end zone, the Cowboys' long drive stalled out and they had to settle for a 34-yard FG from kicker Nick Folk, to make it 17-14 for the Cowboys. The drive took up over 8 minutes of the 3rd quarter. The next 2 series of the game resulted in punts. After a 25-yard punt return, the Giants had excellent field position at the Dallas 37 yard line. The drive went into the start of the 4th quarter, where Brandon Jacobs rumbled into the end zone for a 1-yard touchdown, to make it 21-17 for the Giants. As the 4th quarter ticked on, both teams exchanged punts on the next 4 series. With 1:50 left in the game, the Cowboys took over on the Giants 48 yard line after a short punt return. They marched down to the Giants 22 yard line with 31 seconds left, still trailing 21-17. On 3rd and 11, with 21 seconds left, Romo lofted a pass into the corner of the end zone that dropped just in front of receiver Patrick Crayton, who had a couple steps on his defender. Replays showed that Crayton hesitated at the top of his route instead of running straight into the end zone, which is where Romo expected him. The pass fell incomplete as a result. Now on 4th down and 11, with just 16 seconds left, Romo heaved a desperation pass into the back of the end zone, into double coverage, which was intercepted by Giants cornerback R.W. McQuarters, effectively ending the game, 21-17 Giants. The 2007 Dallas Cowboy season ended in disappointment, after raising huge hopes with a spectacular 13-3 regular season, the best season for the Cowboys since their last Super Bowl season of 1995.

Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: The first MP4 player was born years ago. Soon many music fans were wondering how fantastic it is! If you have been into technology enough, perhaps you may have a knowledge of the MP4. If not, you do need to know something before buying one, even if you are familiar with MP3. MP3 is the CD-like disc with greater capacity. How about MP4? This small digital product will really enrich the joy from listening to music. You can even feel the \\"touch\\" of music to your soul! Now, some similar digital products advertised as \\"MP4 players\\" are simply MP3 players, which do not play video and MPEG format   and also lack other particular functions. These products confuse some buyers, as they may think the \\"MP4\\" players simply mean they can do more than MP3. What is MP4?!  It is a multimedia container. It is not only used to store digital audio   and digital video streams, especially those of MPEG, but can also be used to store other data such as subtitles   and pictures. As a most modern container format, it allows streaming over the Internet.  With the help of a piece of MP4 video equipment, you can change various programs such as MPEG to MP4, ASX to MP4, AVI to MP4 and so on, which can be done very quickly and easily without any effect on the sound quality. By installing   DVD-MP4 software, you can transfer particular music from a DVD to an MP4 video file. It really excites your listening music experience.   Then, there is MP4 advanced and you can set your own collection of all the programs -- TV shows, games, and music. You can even see movies which are still running in cinemas.  _ ?

Justification: Throughout the passage, the author emphasis on the benefits and versatility of MP4, from being a multimedia container that can store different kinds of data, to allowing streaming, and enhancing sound quality. The ability to set your own collection of TV shows, games, music, and view currently running movies as mentioned in the last sentence, display the unique features of an MP4 player. This suggests that buying an MP4 will be a smart choice, therefore option C: a very wise choice to buy an MP4, aligns well with the author's intent."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"Where did Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit originate from?\\"  Context: \\"Culturally, an Ashkenazi Jew can be identified by the concept of Yiddishkeit, which means \\"Jewishness\\" in the Yiddish language. Yiddishkeit is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews. Before the Haskalah and the emancipation of Jews in Europe, this meant the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. From the Rhineland to Riga to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, Yiddishkeit now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and Hasidism, but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, Yiddishkeit can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews, supports Jewish institutions, reads Jewish books and periodicals, attends Jewish movies and theater, travels to Israel, visits historical synagogues, and so forth. It is a definition that applies to Jewish culture in general, and to Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit in particular.\\"  Answer:","output":"Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit, or the unique cultural identity associated with Ashkenazi Jews, originated from the diverse historical, religious, and cultural experiences of Jewish communities residing in Central and Eastern Europe. The development of Yiddishkeit was influenced by various factors such as the migration of Jewish communities throughout Europe, their interaction with surrounding non-Jewish cultures, the religious and cultural practices adopted by these communities, as well as the challenges they faced due to persecution and discrimination. Jewish migration to Europe began in the late Roman period, with the Jewish population expanding into the Rhineland region (comprising present-day Germany and France) during the 9th and 10th centuries. Here, they were exposed to a new cultural milieu, as they came into contact with the Germanic and Latin-speaking Christian population. These early Ashkenazi communities began to develop their unique Jewish identity through the synthesis of their traditional Jewish practices and customs with elements of their new European environment. The development of the Yiddish language itself played a crucial role in shaping Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit. Yiddish, with its combination of Hebrew, Aramaic, German, and Slavic elements, emerged as the lingua franca of Ashkenazi Jewish communities. The Yiddish language not only facilitated communication within the Jewish diaspora but also became an essential medium through which Ashkenazi Jews expressed their religious and cultural beliefs as well as their creativity, including literature, poetry, and theater. The distinctive religious practices of Ashkenazi Jews also contributed to the development of Yiddishkeit. The study of sacred texts like the Torah and Talmud, adherence to Jewish Law, and observance of rituals and holidays formed the core of Ashkenazi religious life. As the Ashkenazi communities faced persecution and expulsion from various European countries, they developed a strong sense of communal solidarity and an unwavering commitment to their faith and traditions. Additionally, the rise of Hasidism in the 18th century offered a more spiritual and mystical dimension to the religious profile of Ashkenazi Jews, which contributed to a rich and diverse tapestry of Ashkenazi religious experience. Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit underwent significant changes with the advent of Haskalah, or the Jewish Enlightenment, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Haskalah aimed to modernize Jewish life by promoting secular education, embracing European culture, and advocating for the emancipation of the Jewish population. As a result, many Ashkenazi Jews began to explore various cultural, intellectual, and political movements outside traditional religious frameworks, such as secularism, socialism, and Zionism. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, continuing political and social upheaval, including the mass migration of Ashkenazi Jews to other parts of the world like the United States and the foundation of the State of Israel, further diversified and reshaped the contours of Yiddishkeit. As their diasporic experience expanded, the cultural horizons of Ashkenazi Jews grew to encompass not only religious and traditional forms of Jewishness but also an eclectic array of expressions and identities within the cultural, political, and artistic spectrum. Today, Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit represents a multifaceted and dynamic cultural identity that has evolved over centuries of complex interactions between the Jewish populations and their surrounding environments. While there has been a decline in the use of the Yiddish language, Yiddishkeit is still identifiable through the artistic and cultural expressions, values, humor, social patterns, culinary traditions, and narratives that continue to enrich the lives of Ashkenazi Jews and the broader Jewish experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: If lions live in communities called prides, then what are lion communities called?  Answer choices: - complex  - PDAs  - groups  - protected  - prides  - murders  - flocks  - dangerous Answer:","output":"Lion communities are called prides. A pride of lions typically consists of several adult females and their offspring, along with one or more adult males that serve as the dominant protectors and breeders within the group. The size of a pride can vary greatly, with some prides consisting of as few as 3 lions, while others may have 40 or more members. Prides have a complex social structure that allows them to efficiently work together as a group. Female lions, also known as lionesses, are typically related and form the core of the pride. They are responsible for hunting and providing food for the entire group. Lionesses work together in a collaborative manner to stalk and capture prey, using their exceptional stealth and speed to increase their chances of success. Male lions in a pride, on the other hand, are focused on protecting the group and its territory from rival prides or other potential threats. These males are usually related, either being siblings or cousins, and form coalitions to help support each other in warding off intruders. The dominant male, or males, have the privilege of mating with the pride's females, fathering the cubs, and ensuring the continuation of their genetic line. It is important to note that lions are not the only animals to have a unique name for their social groups. For instance, groups of crows are called murders, while gatherings of geese are referred to as flocks. These collective nouns provide a convenient and descriptive way to refer to the specific social structures that different animals form. The term \\"pride\\" for a lion community highlights the importance of cooperation and collaboration within these groups. Lions depend on one another for survival, with both males and females playing vital roles in the pride's overall success. The structure of a pride allows lions to thrive in their habitats, working together to overcome challenges like finding food, raising cubs, and defending their territory from rivals or other threats. In conclusion, lion communities are called prides. Prides are groups of lions that consist of related females, their offspring, and dominant males. This unique social structure enables a pride to work as a cohesive unit, utilizing each member's skills and strengths to ensure the successful hunting, reproduction, and protection of the community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in- testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine. This organ consists of three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The large intestine is the last stop in the digestive system. This is where water is absorbed. The food not digested is released as waste.  Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Personal and Chemical\\" correctly answer the question \\"What two forms of digestion help to turn food into nutrients?\\"?","output":"No, the response \\"Personal and Chemical\\" does not correctly answer the question.

What might be the first step of the process?","output":"The first step in the overall process of liver functions is blood filtration. When the blood from the digestive system enters the liver (via the hepatic portal vein), it filters and processes the nutrients, toxins, and waste products present in the blood. This is essential for maintaining the body's overall metabolic balance and preparing substances for further processing or excretion. Here's a breakdown of the functions you mentioned, including their first steps: 1. Bile production: The first step in bile production is synthesizing bile acids from cholesterol. Bile acids are then combined with other substances, like bilirubin and phospholipids, to form bile. Bile is then stored in the gallbladder and released into the small intestine for digestion when needed. 2. Protein production for blood plasma: The liver synthesizes various proteins, including albumin and clotting factors. The initial process involves the translation of amino acids into specific protein chains, based on the information encoded in DNA. These proteins are then folded and modified, if necessary, before being secreted into the bloodstream. 3. Conversion of excess glucose into glycogen for storage: The first step in this process is the phosphorylation of glucose, in which a phosphate group is added to glucose by an enzyme called hexokinase. This creates glucose-6-phosphate, which then undergoes a series of reactions to be converted into glycogen. 4. Conversion of ammonia to urea: The first step in the urea cycle is the formation of carbamoyl phosphate from ammonia and bicarbonate, catalyzed by the enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase. The subsequent steps involve a series of enzymatic reactions, ultimately producing urea, which is excreted by the kidneys. 5. Regulation of blood clotting: The liver primarily achieves this by producing clotting factors, such as fibrinogen, prothrombin, and factors V, VII, IX, and X. The first step in the synthesis of these clotting factors involves the transcription of specific genes that code for these proteins, followed by translation and post-translational modification, as necessary. These clotting factors are then secreted into the bloodstream, where they play a crucial role in initiating and regulating the blood clotting process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Georgette Heyer (; 16 August 1902 - 4 July 1974) was an English historical romance and detective fiction novelist. Her writing career began in 1921, when she turned a story for her younger brother into the novel The Black Moth. While holidaying with her family in December 1920, Heyer met George Ronald Rougier, who was two years her senior. The two became regular dance partners while Rougier studied at the Royal School of Mines to become a mining engineer. In the spring of 1925, shortly after the publication of her fifth novel, they became engaged. One month later, Heyer's father died of a heart attack. He left no pension, and Heyer assumed financial responsibility for her brothers, aged 19 and 14. Two months after her father's death, on 18 August, Heyer and Rougier married in a simple ceremony.  In October 1925 Rougier was sent to work in the Caucasus Mountains, partly because he had learned Russian as a child. Heyer remained at home and continued to write. In 1926, she released These Old Shades, in which the Duke of Avon courts his own ward. Unlike her first novel, These Old Shades focused more on personal relationships than on adventure. The book appeared in the midst of the 1926 United Kingdom general strike; as a result, the novel received no newspaper coverage, reviews, or advertising. Nevertheless, the book sold 190,000 copies. Because the lack of publicity had not harmed the novel's sales, Heyer refused for the rest of her life to promote her books, even though her publishers often asked her to give interviews. She once wrote to a friend that \\"as for being photographed at Work or in my Old World Garden, that is the type of publicity which I find nauseating and quite unnecessary. My private life concerns no one but myself and my family.\\"  Rougier returned home in the summer of 1926, but within months he was sent to the East African territory of Tanganyika. Heyer joined him there the following year. They lived in a hut made of elephant grass located in the bush; Heyer was the first white woman her servants had ever seen. While in Tanganyika, Heyer wrote The Masqueraders; set in 1745, the book follows the romantic adventures of siblings who pretend to be of the opposite sex in order to protect their family, all former Jacobites. Although Heyer did not have access to all of her reference material, the book contained only one anachronism: she placed the opening of White's a year too early. She also wrote an account of her adventures, titled \\"The Horned Beast of Africa\\", which was published in 1929 in the newspaper The Sphere.  In 1928, Heyer followed her husband to Macedonia, where she almost died after a dentist improperly administered an anaesthetic. She insisted they return to England before starting a family. The following year Rougier left his job, making Heyer the primary breadwinner. After a failed experiment running a gas, coke, and lighting company, Rougier purchased a sports shop in Horsham with money they borrowed from Heyer's aunts. Heyer's brother Boris lived above the shop and helped Rougier, while Heyer continued to provide the bulk of the family's earnings with her writing.

It won the MTV Movie Spoof Award at the MTV Movie Awards 2007. The short was created by Andy Signore along with some of his friends. During his speech, he said, roughly, \\"The film was not making fun of a tragedy; it was a tribute to those who stood up against tyranny\\". Can we infer the following? United 300 was banned from some schools","output":"Based on the information provided, it is not explicitly stated that United 300 was banned from some schools. The film is a parody of two popular movies, \\"United 93\\" and \\"300\\", and was created by Andy Signore along with his friends. The film won the MTV Movie Spoof Award at the MTV Movie Awards in 2007, which signifies its recognition and appreciation within the entertainment industry. However, this does not necessarily imply that the film faced any ban or restrictions, particularly in schools. According to Signore's statement during his speech, the short film was intended as a tribute to those who stood up against tyranny, rather than making fun of a tragedy. This suggests that the creators of the parody were mindful of the potential sensitivity around the themes of the films being spoofed, especially \\"United 93\\", which is based on the real-life events of the September 11, 2001 attacks. It is possible that some schools might have disapproved of the film due to its subject matter or the nature of parody, especially if they have concerns related to the way the film handles real-life tragedies or the historical events depicted in the movies it parodies. However, without further information specifically indicating that United 300 was banned from some schools, it would be speculative to make that inference. In conclusion, while it is not possible to definitively state whether or not United 300 was banned from some schools based on the provided information, it is essential to recognize that the creators of the parody intended it as a tribute and not as a way of making fun of tragic events. To accurately determine if the film faced any restrictions or bans, further research would be necessary to corroborate such claims."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, this could be about an Australian sculptor named Bronwyn Joy Gooda. Bronwyn was born on February 22, 1959, in Gum Flat, New South Wales, Australia, and passed away on July 11, 2006. Unfortunately, there isn't a well-known artist by that name in public records or renowned art circles. However, it is plausible that Bronwyn Joy Gooda could have been a local or lesser-known artist whose life and work primarily took place in Australia.  In a country famous for its love for art, it is not uncommon to find talented individuals who engage in various forms of artistic expression, including sculpture. Sculpture, as an artistic medium, has a long tradition of being an integral part of Australian culture. This field is known for producing world-renowned artists such as Ron Mueck, Deborah Halpern, and Ricky Swallow, among others. Considering the timeframe of her life, it is possible that Bronwyn Joy Gooda's work may have been influenced by popular sculptural movements and styles of her time. These could include Abstract Expressionism, Minimalism, or Postmodernism. It is also likely that she could have been influenced and inspired by fellow Australian artists, incorporating distinct elements and themes related to her cultural background, such as Aboriginal art and symbolism, as well as the Australian landscape. Her sculptures may have been exhibited in local galleries or events, providing a platform for Bronwyn to share her work with her community or perhaps even nationally. Although not much information is available about her artistic career, her art may very well have left an impact on those who encountered it. It is important to remember that the significance of an artist's work cannot always be measured by their fame or public recognition alone. In conclusion, while we cannot accurately confirm that the details provided refer to a specific, well-known Australian artist, it is quite plausible that these details refer to Bronwyn Joy Gooda, who might have been a talented and passionate artist in her own right. Her contributions to the world of sculpture, even if known to a limited audience, should be remembered and acknowledged."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Plot title: John Carpenter's The Fog Movie plot: Set in a Northern California fishing town called Antonio Bay, the town is about to celebrate its centennial on April 21, 1980, and are having a celebration led by Kathy Williams (Janet Leigh). However, the centennial is also marked by ominous events, including the appearance of a glowing fog that spreads over land and sea.In the first scene, on the night before the town's celebration, a group of children seated around a campfire on a beach, are entertained by a ghost story, told by 'old' Mr. Machen (John Houseman) (exactly at the stroke of midnight), the resident elderly fisherman. The story being told is indicative of the history of the town's formation, which is being discovered at that exact moment by the local priest, Father Malone (Hal Holbrook), when he finds the diary of his grandfather (who was also the town's priest).The diary later reveals a dark secret unknown to the current inhabitants where, in 1880, six of the founders of Antonio Bay (including Malone's grandfather) deliberately sank and plundered the Elizabeth Dane, a clipper ship owned by Blake, a wealthy man with leprosy who wanted to establish a colony near Antonio Bay. The six conspirators lit a fire on the beach near treacherous rocks, and the crew of the clipper, deceived by the false beacon, crashed into them. Everyone aboard the ship perished. The six conspirators were motivated both by greed and disgust at the notion of having a leper colony nearby. Antonio Bay and its church were then founded with the gold plundered from the ship.The mysterious fog contains the vengeful ghosts of Blake and the clipper's crew, who have come back on the 100th anniversary of the shipwreck and the founding of the town to apparently take the lives of six people (symbolic substitutes for the six conspirators).This same night, three local fishermen, Al Williams, Tommy Wallace, and Dick Baxter, are gruesomely murdered by supernatural attackers after the fog covers their boat. Just prior to their deaths, Al and Tommy are standing on the deck of the boat and... My question: Who kills Dan? Answer:","output":"In the movie John Carpenter's The Fog, the character Dan O'Bannon (played by Charles Cyphers) is killed by the vengeful ghosts of Blake and the crew of the Elizabeth Dane. These ghosts are within the mysterious, glowing fog that spreads throughout the town of Antonio Bay during its centennial on April 21, 1980. The ghosts have returned to seek revenge on the town as they were wronged 100 years earlier when the six founders of Antonio Bay deliberately sank and plundered their ship, the Elizabeth Dane. The town and its church were built using the gold taken from the ship, which originally belonged to Blake, a wealthy leper who wanted to establish a colony near Antonio Bay. As Dan becomes one of the six victims the vengeful ghosts claim to represent the six conspirators involved in the town's dark past, he meets his demise at the hands of the supernatural attackers concealed within the ominous fog. The deaths of the six victims signify the ghosts' pursuit of justice and retribution for the atrocities committed against them a century before. This chilling plot serves as a reminder of the lingering consequences of deceit and the lengths some entities are willing to go to seek vengeance."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The current study examined the effects of attachment orientation on physiological responses to naturalistic social interactions in adolescents.', 'Two-hundred five black (49%) and white high school students (14-16 years; 50% boys) completed a measure of anxious and avoidant attachment, and underwent 1.5 days of ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate (AmBP and AmHR) monitoring while they tracked social experiences.', 'As predicted, individuals with higher avoidant attachment reported fewer interactions with friends (t [299] = -3.18, p < .01) and more anxious adolescents experienced less pleasant interactions both during (t [299] = -3.59, p < .01) and outside of school hours (t [298] = -3.59, p < .01). Individuals who were higher in anxious attachment showed augmented ambulatory diastolic and systolic blood pressure (AmDBP, AmSBP; both p < .05) in conjunction with current or recent interactions with friends. More avoidant adolescents exhibited augmented AmDBP responses to social conflict (p < .05).Question: Does adolescents ' attachment orientation influence ambulatory blood pressure responses to everyday social interactions?

Part 2: Comprehending the context Usage: \\"Adult attachment theory provides a useful framework for understanding how early developmental experiences affect social processes, associated physiological stress responses, and ultimately, health across the lifespan.\\" Explanation: In this example, we are introduced to the adult attachment theory and how it can be used to study the development of social processes, stress responses, and health across a person's life. Part 3: Details of the study Usage: \\"Two-hundred five black (49%) and white high school students (14-16 years; 50% boys) completed a measure of anxious and avoidant attachment, and underwent 1.5 days of ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate (AmBP and AmHR) monitoring while they tracked social experiences.\\" Explanation: The study involves students from different racial backgrounds and measures their attachment orientation while monitoring their blood pressure and heart rate during social experiences. This part of the definition provides information about the study participants and the process of the study. Part 4: Results of the study Usage: \\"Individuals with higher avoidant attachment reported fewer interactions with friends and more anxious adolescents experienced less pleasant interactions both during and outside of school hours. Individuals who were higher in anxious attachment showed augmented ambulatory diastolic and systolic blood pressure in conjunction with current or recent interactions with friends.\\" Explanation: The study found that attachment orientation influences individuals' social interactions and their ambulatory blood pressure responses to these interactions. Anxious attachment leads to increased blood pressure during social interactions, while avoidant attachment results in fewer interactions with friends. Part 5: Answering the question Usage: \\"Does adolescents ' attachment orientation influence ambulatory blood pressure responses to everyday social interactions?\\" Explanation: Based on the information from the study, the answer to the question is yes, adolescents' attachment orientation does influence ambulatory blood pressure responses to everyday social interactions.

Background: Ronnie and Reggie Kray were born on 24 October 1933 in Hoxton, East London, to Charles David Kray (10 March 1907 - 8 March 1983), a scrap gold dealer, and Violet Annie Lee (5 August 1909 - 4 August 1982). They were of English, Jewish, Irish and Romani Gypsy heritage. The brothers were identical twins, with Reggie being born ten minutes before Ronnie. Their parents already had a six-year-old son, Charles James (9 July 1927 - 4 April 2000). Context: Ronnie Kray shot and killed George Cornell, a member of the Richardsons (a rival South London gang), at the Blind Beggar pub in Whitechapel on 9 March 1966. The day before, there had been a shoot-out at Mr. Smith's, a nightclub in Catford, involving the Richardson gang and Richard Hart, an associate of the Krays, who was shot dead. This public shoot-out led to the arrest of nearly all the Richardson gang. Cornell, by chance, was not present at the club during the shoot-out and was not arrested. Whilst visiting the hospital to check up on his friends, he randomly chose to visit the Blind Beggar pub, only a mile away from where the Krays lived.  Ronnie was drinking in another pub when he learned of Cornell's location. He went there with his driver \\"Scotch Jack\\" John Dickson and his assistant Ian Barrie. Ronnie went into the pub with Barrie, walked straight to Cornell and shot him in the head in public view. Barrie, confused by what happened, fired five shots in the air warning the public not to report what had happened to the police. Just before he was shot, Cornell remarked, \\"Well, look who's here.\\" He died at 3:00am in hospital.  Ronnie Kray was already suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the killing.  According to some sources, Ronnie killed Cornell because Cornell referred to Ronnie as a \\"fat poof\\" (a derogatory term for gay men) during a confrontation between the Krays and the Richardson gang at the Astor Club on Christmas Day 1965.  Richardson gang member \\"Mad\\" Frankie Fraser was tried for the murder of Richard Hart at Mr.Smith's, but was found not guilty. Richardson gang member Ray \\"the Belgian\\" Cullinane testified that he saw Cornell kicking Hart. Witnesses would not co-operate with the police in the murder case due to intimidation, and the trial ended inconclusively without pointing to any suspect in particular. Question: Was Ronnie charged?.

To answer this question completely, I would need to look for additional information outside the provided context.  However, based on the text given, it is described that Ronnie Kray shot Cornell in the head in public view, and he did so while suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. This statement could imply that there were witnesses to the event, which typically leads to charges being filed. Yet, the text also says that witnesses did not cooperate with the police due to intimidation, meaning this could have affected the decision to charge Ronnie Kray.

Answer the following question: Given the background: Fish mortality is a parameter used in fisheries population dynamics to account for the loss of fish in a fish stock through death. The mortality can be divided into two types:  Natural mortality: the removal of fish from the stock due to causes not associated with fishing. Such causes can include disease, competition, cannibalism, old age, predation, pollution or any other natural factor that causes the death of fish. In fisheries models natural mortality is denoted by (M).[1] Fishing mortality: the removal of fish from the stock due to fishing activities using any fishing gear.[1] It is denoted by (F) in fisheries models.  and the situation: The fisherman had 2 choices: he could go to Silver Lake situated at a higher altitude and fish there; or he could go to Red lake, a few miles further down the road. Both lakes were natural, but Red Lake had a few pollution problems last year, and the oxygen levels in the water decreased, leading to many fish dying.

Article: A 15-year-old Saanich student who invented a flashlight powered by body heat is heading home today from California with a big prize--and an opportunity to expand on her work. St. Michaels University School student Ann Makosinski was the only Canadian among the four winners at Google's annual international science fair, beating out thousands of other young scientists from around the world. Winning the international contest was \\"a total shock\\", Ann said from San Francisco. \\"I definitely think it will have an influence on my future.\\" Ann thanked her family for encouraging her interest in science, telling the judges that her first toy was a box of transistors  . Ann's prize includes a 25,000 scholarship and a \\"once-in-a-lifetime experience\\" from either the European Organization for Nuclear Research, Lego or Google for her Hollow Flashlight, which has no moving parts or batteries. Ann created the flashlight for a local science fair. The inspiration for the invention came from seeing unwanted batteries and after visits to the Philippines, where she saw the need for a battery-free flashlight. A friend at school there failed in her studies because of a lack of electricity and light to study when it became dark. In her project, Ann wrote that she \\"made two flashlights that do not use any batteries, harmful chemicals, or kinetic energy  . They do not create any noise and will always work. The flashlight's only limitation is its need for at least a 5degC temperature difference to provide usable light.\\" A You Tube video of Ann explaining how she created the flashlight has been viewed more than 1.4 million times. Despite her success, the private school student is undecided about her career path. Ann hopes she can find a way to combine her love of film with science. The four winners were chosen from 15 finalists from eight countries. The contest attracted thousands of entries from students in 120 countries.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What position did the man that Hammer and Mazzoli rescue have during their training? ?  Lawrence Hammer and Dean Mazzoli are two Naval Officers undergoing the rigorous and demanding Navy BUD/s training program. Both men quest to become Navy SEALs. During the training Hammer is shown as cocky and not a true team player. Mazzoli is a natural leader who is respected by the other trainees. The two men clash over time due to Hammer's attitude making a bad name for everyone. The two men's feud eventually is seen by the training instructs and after being punished in a \\"military manner\\" the two become friends. On liberty Mazzoli takes an interest in Barbara, a known love interest and friend of Hammer's. Barbara and Mazzoli share a romantic moment under a capsized canoe but Mazzoli breaks away before anything further happens knowing that his friend Hammer has been \\"with\\" her for a while. Later that night Hammer and Barbara elope and Mazzoli is shocked but accepts the marriage. The two finish their BUD/s training and Mazzoli informs Hammer that he is completing his SDV training on the East Coast, not the West Coast as Hammer will be doing. A brief confrontation between the two occurs on the beach and subsides when Mazzoli says it is because of Barbara. Soon Iraq invades Kuwait and Hammer is seen on a reconnaissance mission with Bosco, who was Mazzoli's and Hammer's former lead training instructor. After coming under enemy fire Bosco is taken prisoner. Hammer and Mazzoli reunite when Mazzoli comes to aid in the rescue mission of Bosco. While preparing for the mission the two catch up, with Hammer talking about how Barbara and her son Josh both miss seeing him. He further goes on and tells of his infidelities and about Barbara knowing about his unfaithfulness. Hammer and Mazzoli successfully rescue Bosco but Hammer is severely injured during the mission.

Summarize: Researchers believe one in 2,000 people in the UK is a carrier of the disease linked to eating contaminated beef. Their estimate in the BMJ comes from studying more than 32,000 samples of human tissue removed during appendix operations carried out between 2000 and 2012 at 41 hospitals. It remains unclear if any of these carriers will ever develop symptoms. Early predictions of a vCJD epidemic didn't come to fruition. To date, here have been 177 UK deaths from vCJD. Most of these occurred in the late 90s and early 2000s. There has been only one death in the last two years. The rare, fatal disease progressively attacks the brain. But it appears that relatively few who catch the infectious agent that causes the disease develop symptoms. People can be \\"silent\\" carriers for decades and not even know it. The BMJ research identified 16 such carriers out of the thousands of appendix tissue samples studied. Experts say many vital questions remain unanswered. Since the link between vCJD and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), known as mad cow disease, was discovered in 1996, there have been strict controls to prevent meat from infected cattle from entering the food chain. However, the average time it takes for the symptoms of vCJD to occur after initial infection is still unclear. Preventing spread This means people exposed to infected meat before the food controls were introduced continue to develop variant CJD, and may spread it to others. Experience tells us that the disease could be transmitted from human to human via blood - in the UK, there have been three reported cases of vCJD associated with a blood transfusion. Blood donor services take measures to ensure blood is not infected but there is no test to screen for vCJD, although scientists are working on this. And there is currently no cure for the disease. Prof Sebastian Brandner of University College London, who led the BMJ research, said: \\"We do not know what will happen. \\"Will these people develop disease and can they transmit it? There are many questions we still do not know the answers to.\\" Prof Richard Knight, director of the National CJD Research and Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh, said the answers might not be known for decades. In the meantime, surveillance was key, he said. \\"You can see from the data available that its likely that we will get a secondary or tertiary wave of disease but its likely that these further waves will be small. \\"Future clinical cases will be pretty small in number,\\" he added. Dr Graham Jackson, of the MRC Prion Unit at UCL Institute of Neurology, said: \\"Given the high levels of infection indicated by this research, it is now crucial we establish how many people in the UK harbour that infection in their bloodstream in order to adequately assess the risks of transmission through contaminated blood donations. \\"Studies to develop new blood tests for CJD must remain a priority to assist with screening and protecting the UK blood supply.\\"","output":"Researchers have found that one in every 2,000 people in the UK could be carriers of the disease linked to eating contaminated beef.

The first important difference is in the man's role.The traditional husband was the head of the household because he was the only one who worked outside the home.If the wife worked for money,then the husband was not considered to be a good provider,In many families today,both husband and wife work for money.Therefore,they share the role of head of household.In addition,the traditional husband usually made big decisions about spending money.However,the modern husband shares these decisions with his working wife.Also,the traditional husband did not help his wife with housework or meal preparation.  Dinner was ready when he came home,In contrast,the modern husband helps his working wife at home.He may do some of the household chores,and it is not unusual for him to cook. The second difference is in the woman's role. In the traditional family,the woman may have worked for miney during her first years of marriage.However,when she gave birth,she would usually give up her job. Her primary role would be to take care of her family and home.In contrast,in many families today,the modern woman works outside the home even after she has children .She's doing two jobs instead of one,so she is busier than the traditional mother was.The traditional wife learned to live within her husband's income.But the modern wife does not have to because the family has two incomes. The final difference is in the role of the children .In the traditional family,the children were taken care of by the mother because she didn't work outside.However,today pre-school children may go to a child-care center or to a baby-sitter regularly because the mother works.The school-age children of a traditional family were more dependent.Their mother was there to help them get ready for school and to make their breakfast.In conrtast,modern children are more independent.They have to get up early and get ready for school themselves,and they may even have to make their own breakfast.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   When was the water level lower, in April or in March?  The water level in Large Lake was high in March, 3 feet higher in April, and 7 feet higher still in May. It dropped to a much lower level in September, October and November, when they released a significant portion of the water as a yearly chore.  Hint: The water level is seasonal, being lowered by about 10 feet (3.0 m) over the winter. The reservoir fills in the spring from snow melt and underground springs. The lake is usually at full level by late spring, but in the occasional years of low snow melt and low rainfall, it may remain up to several feet below its typical level. Water is let out of the lake in the fall so that ice will not damage docks and other structures around the lake. This also leads to excellent water quality, as a significant portion of the water is replaced every year. A:","output":"The water level was lower in March.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What does Adrian Kingsley-Hughes say of his thoughts on the origins of the interface?\\"  Context: \\"The interface of Windows 8 has been the subject of mixed reaction. Bright wrote that its system of hot corners and edge swiping \\"wasn't very obvious\\" due to the lack of instructions provided by the operating system on the functions accessed through the user interface, even by the video tutorial added on the RTM release (which only instructed users to point at corners of the screen or swipe from its sides). Despite this \\"stumbling block\\", Bright said that Windows 8's interface worked well in some places, but began to feel incoherent when switching between the \\"Metro\\" and desktop environments, sometimes through inconsistent means. Tom Warren of The Verge wrote that the new interface was \\"as stunning as it is surprising\\", contributing to an \\"incredibly personal\\" experience once it is customized by the user, but had a steep learning curve, and was awkward to use with a keyboard and mouse. He noted that while forcing all users to use the new touch-oriented interface was a risky move for Microsoft as a whole, it was necessary in order to push development of apps for the Windows Store. Others, such as Adrian Kingsley-Hughes from ZDNet, considered the interface to be \\"clumsy and impractical\\" due to its inconsistent design (going as far as considering it \\"two operating systems unceremoniously bolted together\\"), and concluded that \\"Windows 8 wasn't born out of a need or demand; it was born out of a desire on Microsoft's part to exert its will on the PC industry and decide to shape it in a direction—touch and tablets -- that allows it to compete against, and remain relevant in the face of Apple's iPad.\\"\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Adrian Kingsley-Hughes, a writer for ZDNet, expressed his thoughts on the origins of the Windows 8 interface as an attempt by Microsoft to shape the PC industry and remain relevant amidst the growing popularity of touch devices and tablets, such as Apple's iPad. He believed that the interface was not developed in response to actual needs or demands from users but rather as a strategic move by Microsoft to compete against its rivals and maintain a strong foothold in the industry. Kingsley-Hughes further criticized the Windows 8 interface for being \\"clumsy and impractical\\" due to the inconsistent design between the \\"Metro\\" environment and the classic desktop view. He perceived the interface as an amalgamation of two operating systems that were awkwardly and abruptly connected, which resulted in a disjointed user experience. This inconsistency in design made navigating the operating system difficult and confusing for users, as they would have to switch between the two different environments. Moreover, Kingsley-Hughes argued that the lack of clear instructions on how to utilize the new touch-based interface, such as the hot corners and edge swiping features, contributed to the overall negative reception of the operating system. The video tutorial added in the RTM release proved to be insufficient, as it only instructed users to point at the corners of the screen or swipe from its sides without explaining the functions of accessing the user interface. Despite these criticisms, some, like Tom Warren of The Verge, acknowledged the necessity for Microsoft to adopt a touch-oriented interface to push app development for the Windows Store and adapt to the changing landscape of the tech industry. However, even Warren conceded that the learning curve associated with the new interface was steep and its integration with a keyboard and mouse setup was clunky and uncomfortable. Overall, Adrian Kingsley-Hughes' thoughts on the origins of the Windows 8 interface revolve around the idea that the design was driven by Microsoft's desire to assert its influence on the PC industry and adapt to the growing trend of touch and tablet devices. Although the interface showed potential in some aspects, its clumsy and inconsistent design, coupled with the lack of clear instructions, resulted in a negative user experience that left many users displeased and frustrated with the operating system."},{"instruction":"Question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Gordon Liu Review: When I purchased this DVD I wasn't expecting much, but it's Gordon Liu so I thought I'd give it a try.

Possible A: kitchen floor, furniture, house, mobile home, own land  Why is \\"mobile home\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Mobile home\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for several reasons. First, let's analyze the question and the context it provides: \\"Where do you live if you have cheap linoleum covering and boxy rooms?\\" The question is essentially asking for a type of living space characterized by these specific attributes:  1. Cheap linoleum covering: Linoleum is an affordable flooring material that has been commonly used in a variety of residential settings, including mobile homes. It is durable, inexpensive, and easy to install, which makes it an ideal choice for living spaces that need to be cost-effective and functional. 2. Boxy rooms: Boxy rooms refer to spaces with limited architectural design and simple, rectangular shapes. This description may be indicative of a living environment that is designed with practicality and affordability in mind, which is a common characteristic of mobile homes. Now, looking at the possible answers: a. Kitchen floor: This answer refers to a part of a house rather than the type of living space itself, so it doesn't align with the context provided by the question. b. Furniture: This answer is not relevant, as it refers to objects within a living space rather than the living space itself. c. House: While a house could potentially have both cheap linoleum covering and boxy rooms, the question is presenting a specific combination of features that seems to be hinting at a more particular type of living arrangement, which makes \\"house\\" a less fitting answer. d. Mobile home: As mentioned earlier, a mobile home is a type of affordable, functional living space that often features inexpensive linoleum flooring and boxy, rectangular rooms, making it a suitable answer to the question given the specific attributes mentioned. e. Own land: This answer refers to property ownership rather than the type of living space, making it irrelevant to the question's context. In conclusion, when taking into consideration the context and features mentioned in the question, \\"mobile home\\" aligns with human common sense as it accurately reflects a type of living space characterized by cheap linoleum covering and boxy rooms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The magazine is known for its investigative journalism, political commentaries, and cultural analysis, covering topics such as social issues, economics, and the arts. Born in the mid-1950s, it has since then played a key role in shaping public opinion through its in-depth articles and outstanding journalism. While there are a number of news magazines and dailies that compete with l'Espresso in the Italian media landscape, its biggest rival is Panorama. Panorama is a prominent Italian weekly news magazine founded in 1962 and published by the Arnoldo Mondadori Editore, Italy's largest publishing company. Similar to l'Espresso, Panorama provides its readers with extensive coverages on current events, politics, economy, culture, and entertainment. Both l'Espresso and Panorama have strong readerships, and they appeal to different segments of the Italian public. While l'Espresso is known for its liberal and progressive perspective, often delving deep into social injustices and political corruption, Panorama is considered to have a more center-right leaning and is affiliated with Silvio Berlusconi's media empire. This places Panorama in a more conservative political space, compared to l'Espresso's left-leaning position. Throughout the years, the rivalry between l'Espresso and Panorama has been fueled by their contrasting editorial stances and unique journalistic styles. Competing for the same target audience, these leading Italian weekly news magazines continue to vie for supremacy, each striving to be the primary source of credible and well-informed content to their readers. In conclusion, Panorama is l'Espresso's biggest rival in the Italian weekly news magazine market, with both publications occupying significant positions within the country's media landscape. Their contrasting political affiliations and editorial approaches contribute to their ongoing competition to earn and maintain the trust and attention of readers in Italy and abroad."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In both sentences, the speaker believes that a certain event or decision is favorable or the most appropriate course of action. Here is a detailed breakdown of each sentence: Sentence 1: \\"That was probably for the best.\\" In this sentence, the use of \\"that\\" indicates a specific event or decision. The phrase \\"for the best\\" means that the event or decision is considered to be the most beneficial or suitable choice. The use of \\"probably\\" implies some uncertainty, but the speaker conveys that they believe the event or decision is ultimately a positive one. Sentence 2: \\"This was probably the best solution.\\" In this sentence, the use of \\"this\\" also refers to a specific event or decision, just like \\"that\\" in Sentence 1. The phrase \\"the best solution\\" conveys that the event or decision is seen as the optimal choice. The use of \\"probably\\" once again introduces an element of uncertainty, but the speaker still conveys a belief that the decision or event is a favorable one. Although Sentence 2 uses the term \\"solution\\" and Sentence 1 uses the phrase \\"for the best,\\" they both refer to the idea that an event or decision is the most favorable choice in a particular situation.

Write an article based on this summary: – A busy weekend for California Gov. Jerry Brown culminated in several signed bills designed to assist students across his state.

It's the first state to impose such a mandate. To prevent perpetrators from claiming they never heard a definite \\"no\\" from their victims, the bill now calls for an \\"affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity.\\" The legislation is meant to protect individuals who are drunk, drugged, asleep, or unconscious, the AP reports; it notes consent can be nonverbal (ie, a nod of the head). The bill adds that colleges and universities have to come up with a blueprint to help sexual assault victims, make counseling and health services available, and better train faculty who review such cases. \\"This is amazing,\\" says a UCLA student. \\"It's going to educate an entire new generation of students on what consent is and what consent is not ... that the absence of a 'no' is not a 'yes.'\\" Also signed by Brown over the weekend: a bill that offers college loans to students in the US illegally, and a bill that will ask voters whether to repeal parts of a 1998 law that mandate school instruction be in English. (Some people aren't happy with the way Florida State has handled its sexual assault cases.)","output":"Title: California Leads the Way in Strengthening Sexual Assault Prevention on Campus In an effort to combat sexual assault on college campuses, California Gov. Jerry Brown recently signed several bills aimed at helping students across the state. The most notable among these is Senate Bill 967 (SB-967), which has placed California as the first state to implement an \\"affirmative consent\\" mandate for colleges and universities. This groundbreaking legislation has the potential to reshape how sexual assault cases are handled on campus and protect an entire generation of students. The traditional \\"no means no\\" mantra is axed by SB-967, and instead, colleges and universities will now need to adopt a standard of \\"clear consent\\" when it comes to students' sexual activity, reports the Los Angeles Times. This transformation is an essential step towards mitigating sexual assault on campuses across the state and establishing a safer environment for all students. To prevent perpetrators from claiming that they never heard a definite \\"no\\" from their victims, the bill now requires that \\"an affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity\\" be demonstrated by all parties. This legislation is intended to protect individuals who may be intoxicated, drugged, asleep, or unconscious. It is noteworthy that consent can be nonverbal, such as through a nod of the head. In addition to requiring clear consent, SB-967 proposes that all colleges and universities in the state devise a blueprint to assist victims of sexual assault. This includes providing access to counseling and health services, as well as improving the training of faculty who review such cases. The overall aim of the bill is to create a more supportive ecosystem for sexual assault victims, ensuring that their voices are heard and that they receive the necessary resources to heal and move forward. A UCLA student was quoted as saying, \\"This is amazing. It's going to educate an entire new generation of students on what consent is and what consent is not...that the absence of a 'no' is not a 'yes.'\\" With California leading the way on this crucial issue, it is hoped that other states will follow suit and adopt similar legislation to better protect students on college campuses nationwide. Other bills signed by Gov. Jerry Brown during a busy weekend included a bill offering college loans to students who are undocumented and living in the US, as well as a bill proposing a vote on whether to repeal parts of a 1998 law mandating that school instruction be in English. Given the attention that sexual assault cases have received – including the criticism faced by Florida State University for its handling of such incidents – it is crucial that robust efforts are made in preventing and addressing these crimes on campus. With the passage of SB-967, California has taken a significant step forward in ensuring the safety and well-being of its college students."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Run the apple under clean water, turning it as necessary to remove any dirt and debris.  Remove the skin with a pairing knife or vegetable peeler. Options are: -- Use either a knife or vegetable peeler to gently peel the skin off the apple. Try to remove only a thin layer of skin and keep most of the apple intact. -- Use a shallow cutting knife to cut away the skin near the nape of the apple. Heat the base vegetable roux to 350 ° f (177 ° c). -- Washing apples removes some of the outer flesh in the apples, making it easier to cut. If you don't have a pair of cutting knives, use a paring knife, plastic spoon, or pie plate to peel your apples. -- Scrubbing the apples gently with a vegetable peeler will expose the skin. If you don't have any vegetable peeler, use a bread grater to remove the skin at the base of the apple.","output":"After washing and peeling the apples, the most logical next step would be to core and slice the apples for stewing. Here's a detailed explanation: 1. Core the apples:    -- Use an apple corer or a sharp knife to remove the core from each apple. Place the apple on a cutting board and push the corer or knife into the center of the apple, starting at the stem end and going through the bottom. Twist the corer slightly and pull it back through the apple, bringing the core with it. If you don't have an apple corer, you can use a sharp knife to cut around the core by cutting the apple into quarters first and then removing the core section from each quarter. 2. Slice the apples:    -- Once the core has been removed, slice the apples. Cut each apple into even slices – about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick – depending on your preference. Thinner slices will cook faster and become softer, while thicker slices will retain more of their shape and texture as they cook. Ensure all the slices are of similar thickness for even cooking. 3. Place the apple slices in a pot or large saucepan:    -- Select a pot or saucepan with enough space to hold all the apple slices and accommodate the liquid they will release during cooking. Arrange the apple slices in the pot, spreading them evenly. 4. Add sweetener, spices, and liquid:    -- Add your desired sweetener to taste, such as sugar, honey, or maple syrup. Then, add your preferred spices, such as cinnamon, nutmeg, or cloves, according to your preference. To prevent the apples from sticking to the pot and to enhance flavor, add a small amount of liquid – water, apple juice, or cider all work well. Start with just a couple of tablespoons to avoid making the apples too watery, adding more as needed during cooking. 5. Cook the apple slices until tender:    -- Heat the pot or saucepan over medium-low heat, allowing the apples to cook slowly and release their natural juices. Stir the apples occasionally to ensure even cooking. Cook the apples for 15-30 minutes, depending on the thickness of the slices and your desired level of tenderness. 6. Adjust seasonings and serve:    -- Taste the stewed apples and adjust the sweetener and spices as needed. Once the apples are cooked to your desired tenderness, remove them from the heat. You can serve the stewed apples warm or chilled, as a side dish, dessert, or topping for other dishes such as oatmeal, pancakes, or ice cream."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

Chloroquine is a 4-aminoquinoline previously used in malaria therapy and now becoming an emerging investigational antiviral drug due to its broad spectrum of antiviral activities. To explore whether the low pH-dependency of influenza A viruses might affect the antiviral effects of chloroquine at clinically achievable concentrations, we tested the antiviral effects of this drug on selected human and avian viruses belonging to different subtypes and displaying different pH requirements. Results showed a correlation between the responses to chloroquine and NH 4 Cl, a lysosomotropic agent known to increase the pH of intracellular vesicles. Time-of-addition experiments showed that the inhibitory effect of chloroquine was maximal when the drug had been added at the time of infection and was lost after 2 h post-infection. This timing approximately corresponds to that of virus/cell fusion. Moreover, there was a clear correlation between the EC 50 of chloroquine in vitro and the electrostatic potential of the HA subunit (HA2) mediating the virus/ cell fusion process. Overall, the present study highlights the critical importance of a host cell factor such as intravesicular pH in determining the anti-influenza activity of chloroquine and other lysosomotropic agents.

The annual event, put on by Element 11, is a spinoff of the Burning Man festival held in Black Rock City, Nevada. As part of the event, several effigies about 30 feet tall are constructed out of dry wood and ceremoniously burned, according to Element 11 spokesman J.P. Bernier.      Because the burning produces extreme heat, volunteers form a perimeter around the burning for the safety of other participants, Bernier said.      After 11 p.m., volunteers noticed a man who came running forward through the crowd and went past the perimeter. Volunteers made attempts to call out and stop the man, but they were unsuccessful in preventing him from jumping into the fire, Bernier said.      \\"The nature of the fire is such that our volunteers were not able to get close enough to the fire for risk of their own safety,\\" Bernier said. \\"He was very fast; he was very motivated. It wasn't an accident or any act of negligence on anybody's part. He had a very deliberate objective to get past our volunteers, past our safety perimeter.\\"      The victim's name was not released Sunday. Grantsville police issued a very brief statement only saying that they were investigating \\"a fatality at an event being held within Grantsville City.\\"      Many participants were distraught and confused by the suddenness of the incident, according to a participant and a documentary photographer named Christian, who declined to provide his last name.      \\"I did see that a lot of the community was shocked and traumatized,\\" he said. \\"There's a lot of questions, a lot of facts that are unknown.\\"      Doug Johnson said the incident was the first of its kind that he's seen after attending the event for more than a dozen years.      \\"I was blown away,\\" Johnson said. \\"Fifteen years and I've never had anything like that happen, ever.\\"      More than 100 volunteers help facilitate the regional event, which is intended to \\"ignite a culture of creativity in the community,\\" Bernier said. The event hosted more than 1,200 attendees, and members of the volunteer Grantsville Fire Department were present.      A burning scheduled for Sunday morning was canceled after Saturday's incident.      Christian said safety has been an ever-growing priority at the event over the five years he's been attending.      \\"This is the first event that I was restricted as a documentary photographer to ever get near anything there because safety was such a concern,\\" he said. \\"And the fact that he had to break through that barrier anyway, I would just say that it was not something that was easily prevented at all.\\"      Bernier said that while safety procedures were followed, policies will be examined in the hope that such incidents will be prevented in the future.      \\"We'll definitely look at our policies,\\" Bernier said.

A joyous festival was cut tragically short Saturday night when a man burned to death after leaping into a huge ceremonial bonfire.      As a three-story wooden effigy, inspired by the creatures from Where the Wild Things Are, burned to mark the culmination of the Element 11 festival in Grantsville, hundreds of festival-goers watched in horror as Christopher Wallace of Salt Lake City broke through a safety barrier, danced wildly for a few moments and ran full speed into the flames.      \\"He looked like he was having a great time. He was running out there. He was dancing a little bit,\\" witness Daisy McDonald told KUTV. \\"All of a sudden he jumped into the fire. It’s like he didn’t even know it was fire. It’s like he thought it was just a playground.\\"      Fire safety rangers were unable to stop Wallace from tossing himself into the inferno. Witnesses said they saw Wallace’s hand rise up from the flames as he died.      \\"The whole time I was thinking, ‘He’s gonna walk out. He’s gonna be okay,’ \\" McDonald said. \\"I thought he was gonna survive.\\"      Wallace, who was in his late 20s or early 30s, had told other festival-goers earlier in the day that he planned to kill himself by jumping into the burning effigy, said Grantsville police Lt. Steve Barrett.      \\"This is what he was going to do, and it’s what he did,\\" Barrett said, adding that neither security rangers nor firemen could have prevented Wallace from killing himself. \\"It took not even seconds. He was just through the barricades and into the fire.\\"      Grantsville police reviewed video footage recorded by witnesses before determining that Wallace’s death was a suicide. The effigy had been burning for about 30 minutes when Wallace leapt into the fire at about about 11 p.m. Saturday, said Grantsville police Lt. Steve Barrett. Firefighters on scene tried to extinguish the flames but could not save Wallace.      \\"It was shocking to everybody,\\" said Grantsville Mayor Brent Marshall, who did not witness the burn but visits the event site each year to perform a safety inspection. Marshall expressed his sympathy not only for the family of the dead man but also for the people who witnessed the suicide.      \\"Horrific things get embedded into people’s minds,\\" Marshall said. \\"It’s a tragedy any way you want to look at it.\\"      story continues below      story continues below      Element 11, or E-11 for short, is a so-called \\"regional burn,\\" one of dozens of smaller-scale events affiliated with the Burning Man arts and culture festival that takes place in Nevada’s Black Rock Desert every August. The event drew 1,200 attendees, several hundred of whom were on hand when Wallace dove into the burning effigy.      Grantsville police contacted Wallace’s wife Sunday before releasing his name to the public. Police have asked medical examiners to do a toxicology report to determine if Wallace had drugs in his system, Barrett said.

Summarize this article: Alcoholism vaccine will give drinkers an immediate hangover if they drink even a small amount of booze            The vaccine would be effective for between six months and a year      It sends a message to the liver not to express genes that metabolize alcohol      Trials on mice begin next month with human tests planned for November            A vaccine being developed in Chile will give anyone who drinks alcohol and immediate hangover      A new vaccine will give anyone who drinks even a small amount of alcohol an immediate and very heavy hangover.      Scientists from the University of Chile have spent a year designing the drug in a bid to tackle the growing problem of alcoholism in the country.            The vaccine, which would be effective for between six months and a year, works by sending a biochemical message to the liver telling it not to express genes that metabolise alcohol.            Normally, the liver turns alcohol into the hangover-causing compound called acetaldehyde which is then broken down by a metabolising enzyme.      If someone who’s been vaccinated tries to drink alcohol, they will immediately experience severe nausea, accelerated heartbeat, and general discomfort.      Once the vaccine has been administered it cannot be reversed.      A preclinical trial using mice to determine the correct dosing is due to begin next month with researchers hoping to begin tests on human subjects in November.      The vaccine, which would be effective for between six months and a year, works by sending a biochemical message to the liver telling it not to express genes that metabolise alcohol      Dr. Juan Asenjo, director of the university's Institute for Cell Dynamics and Biotechnology said while the vaccine is not a cure-all, it could provide an important first step.      He told the Santiago Times newspaper: 'People who end up alcoholic have a social problem; a personality problem because they’re shy, whatever, and then they are depressed, so it’s not so simple.      Clanger: The hangover vaccine would be effective for between six months and a year      'But if we can solve the chemical, the basic part of the problem, I think it could help quite a bit.      'In Chile, according to the most recent 2011 study from the World Health Organization, one in 15 men have an alcohol use disorder.            Dr Asenjo belives the vaccine has the potential to help millions of people worldwide.      He added: 'If it works, it’s going to have a worldwide impact, but with many vaccines one has to test them carefully. I think the chances that this one will work are quite high.'      Inspiration for the vaccine came from the far East, said Asenjo, where between 15 and 20 pwer cent of Japanese, Chinese or Koreans have a mutation which inhibits the breakdown of alcohol in their bodies.      The idea of using drugs to combat alcoholism is not new.      Disulfiram, which was developed almost a century ago works in a similar way blocking the enzyme from breaking down alcohol, thus intensifying the body’s negative response.      However users often find the effects so unpleasant they simply stop taking the pills.             ||||| Splitting headaches and waves of nausea – a drinker’s worst enemy – may soon provide alcoholics with an unlikely rescue from a crippling addiction.

The way this vaccine works is by sending a message to the liver that tells it not to break down alcohol.

His father, Bobby, was a long-time professional hockey player in both the National Hockey League (NHL) and World Hockey Association (WHA). His mother, Joanne (McKay), was an American professional figure skater and taught him how to skate. He has three brothers: Bobby Jr., Blake and Bart, and a younger sister: Michelle. Hull worked two jobs in 2006-07. He served as a special assistant to the team president of the Dallas Stars and provided studio analysis for NHL on NBC telecasts. He left NBC after one season when he was named a special adviser to the team's hockey operations department. Hull was promoted to interim co-general manager of the Stars, sharing the role with Les Jackson after Doug Armstrong was fired on November 13, 2007. ESPN analyst Scott Burnside criticized the promotion of Hull, noting his lack of front office experience and questionable work ethic.  The pair made one of the most prominent trades in the 2007-08 NHL season, acquiring Brad Richards from the Tampa Bay Lightning as part of a five-player trade. The team went on to reach the Western Conference Final of the 2008 Stanley Cup Playoffs, the Stars' deepest playoff run in eight years. Team owner Tom Hicks rewarded the pair with three-year contracts and named them permanent co-general managers. He credited Hull for his positive relationship with the players and his \\"unconventional wisdom\\".  The signing of controversial forward Sean Avery prior to the 2008-09 season proved a turning point for Hull and Jackson. Avery's erratic behavior created divisions within the team's locker room, particularly after he made derogatory comments towards another player's girlfriend in the media. The Stars missed the playoffs that season, leading the team to replace Hull and Jackson as general manager with Joe Nieuwendyk. Hull remained with the organization, serving as an adviser to Hicks and team president Jeff Cogen.

It's like when you play with your toy cars, and you have that big dump truck that can fit a lot of other smaller toys in it. One sunny day, we had to move to a new house. My brother had just finished packing all his favorite toy soldiers into a big box, and I had folded all my clothes neatly. Our pet dog, Sparky, wagged his tail excitedly as he watched us pack. He knew something fun was about to happen. My brother Sam and I carried the boxes out to his truck. The truck was red, shiny, and had really big wheels. It reminded me of the firetrucks you see in your cartoons! We carefully loaded the boxes in the back of the truck and made sure they were safely stacked like a big block tower. Once the truck was filled with all our boxes and furniture, we hopped into the front seat – me, Sam, and Sparky – and we buckled our seatbelts, just like you do when we go for a car ride. With a big smile, Sam turned the key, and the truck rumbled to life like a friendly giant. As we drove through the neighborhood, our friends and neighbors waved goodbye to us with big smiles, and we waved back at them. Sparky excitedly barked out the window, happy to see all the friendly faces. The ride to our new home wasn't very long, just like when we go to visit Grandma's house. When we arrived, the new house looked so big, just like a castle! It had a lovely big yard for Sparky to run around in, lots of space for your toys, and a big, comfy bedroom for you to sleep in. We carefully unloaded all the boxes and furniture from the truck, working together like a team of ants carrying food back to their nest. It took time, but eventually, we had everything out of the truck, and with a big high five, we were officially in our new house! We all spent the day unpacking and setting up our new rooms, putting your toy cars on the shelves and hanging pictures on the walls. At the end of the day, we sat down in our cozy new living room, ordered pizza – your favorite, pepperoni – and enjoyed a family movie night, feeling very happy in our new home.

Article: Forty-three years seems like a long time to remember the name of a mere acquaintance. I have forgotten the name of an old lady, who was a customer on the paper route in my home town when I was a twelve-year-old boy. Yet it stays in my memory, for she taught me a lesson of forgiveness that I shall never forget. On a winter afternoon, a friend and I were throwing stones onto the leaning roof of the old lady's house from a spot near her backyard. The object of our play was to observe how the stones changed to missiles as they rolled to the roof's edge and shot out into the yard. I found myself a perfectly smooth rock and threw it out. The stone, however, slipped from my hand and headed straight for a small window on the old lady's back porch. At the sound of fractured glass, we knew we were in trouble. We ran as fast as possible. I was too scared about getting caught to be concerned about the old lady with the broken window in winter. However, a few days later, when I was sure that I hadn't been discovered, I started to feel guilty for her misfortune. She still greeted me with a smile each day when I gave her the paper, but I was no longer able to act comfortably in her presence.  I made up my mind that I would save my paper delivery money, and after three weeks I had the seven dollars that I thought would cover the cost of her window. I put the money in an envelope with a note explaining that I was sorry for breaking her window and hoped that the seven dollars would cover the cost. I put the letter through the letter slot in her door. My soul felt  _ and I could have the freedom of, once again, looking straight into the old lady's kind eyes. The next day, I handed the old lady her paper and was able to return the warm smile that I was receiving from her. She gave me a bag of cookies. I thanked her and felt an envelope in it.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The film is based on actual events, beginning in August 1941.  Nazi Einsatzgruppen (task forces) are sweeping through Eastern Europe, systematically killing Jews. Among the survivors not killed or restricted to ghettoes are the Belarusian Jewish Bielski brothers: Tuvia, Zus, Asael and Aron. Their parents are dead, killed by local police under orders from the occupying Germans. The brothers flee to the Naliboki Forest, vowing to avenge the deaths of their parents. They encounter other Jewish escapees hiding in the forest, and the brothers take them under their protection and leadership. Tuvia kills the local Auxiliary Police chief responsible for his parents' deaths. Over the next year, they shelter a growing number of refugees, raiding local farms for food and supplies and moving their camp whenever they are discovered by the collaborationist police. Bielski brothers stage raids on the Germans and their collaborators. Casualties cause Tuvia to reconsider this approach because of the risk to the hiding Jews. Rivalry between the two eldest brothers, Tuvia and Zus, fuels a disagreement between them about their future; as winter approaches, Zus decides to leave the camp and join a local company of Soviet partisans, while his older brother Tuvia remains with the camp as their leader. An arrangement is made between the two groups in which the Soviet partisans agree to protect the Jewish camp in exchange for supplies.

Q:The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who was one of the first people to study conservation? is inside the article: Nigel Reuben Rook Williams (15 July 1944 – 21 April 1992) was an English conservator and expert on the restoration of ceramics and glass. From 1961 until his death he worked at the British Museum, where he became the Chief Conservator of Ceramics and Glass in 1983. There his work included the successful restorations of the Sutton Hoo helmet and the Portland Vase. Joining as an assistant at age 16, Williams spent his entire career, and most of his life, at the British Museum. He was one of the first people to study conservation, not yet recognised as a profession, and from an early age was given responsibility over high-profile objects. In the 1960s he assisted with the re-excavation of the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, and in his early- to mid-twenties he conserved many of the objects found therein: most notably the Sutton Hoo helmet, which occupied a year of his time. He likewise reconstructed other objects from the find, including the shield, drinking horns, and maplewood bottles. The \\"abiding passion of his life\\" was ceramics, and the 1970s and 1980s gave Williams ample opportunities in that field. After nearly 31,000 fragments of shattered Greek vases were found in 1974 amidst the wreck of HMS Colossus, Williams set to work piecing them together. The process was televised, and turned him into a television personality. A decade later, in 1988 and 1989, Williams's crowning achievement came when he took to pieces the Portland Vase, one of the most famous glass objects in the world, and put it back together. The reconstruction was again televised for a BBC programme, and as with the Sutton Hoo helmet, took nearly a year to complete. Williams died at age 47 of a heart attack while in Aqaba, Jordan, where he was working on a British Museum excavation. The Ceramics & Glass group of the Institute of Conservation awards a biennial prize in his honour, recognising his significant contributions in the field of conservation., can you guess it ?

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who is surrounded by staffers?  Manfred Link is the President of the United States. He and the usually tipsy First Lady have a 28-year-old, sex-starved daughter named Gloria. The President is surrounded by a number of eccentric staffers and allies, including vice president Shockley, ambassador Spender, press secretary Bunthorne and a presidential aide named Feebleman. He also is advised by General Dumpston, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The administration needs the support of the (fictional) African nation of Upper Gorm for an upcoming vote and must deal with Longo, that country's United Nations ambassador. Unfortunately, it can find only one American who knows how to speak the Upper Gormese language, a man named Alexander Grade. As best they can understand it, the ruler of Upper Gorm wants, in exchange, a number of Americans sent to his land so that his country, like the United States, can know what it's like to have an oppressed minority. Gloria is kidnapped and Americans are transported to Africa like slaves.

Charges can build up by friction. Maybe you rub your feet on a wool mat or carpet. Rubber soled shoes readily gain charges. The wool carpet easily gives up charges. The two items become unbalanced. One item has a positive charge. The other has a negative charge. The difference in charge is called static electricity. Just like the teeter-totter, something is going to move.

After reading the above, is \\"It does not move\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What happens if static electricity is not balanced?\\"?","output":"No, sweetie, \\"It does not move\\" is not the correct answer. When static electricity is not balanced, it means one thing, like your shoes, has more negative charges, and the other thing, like the carpet, has more positive charges.

A young woman who was given three months to live and started completing her ‘bucket list’ has stunned doctors by making a miraculous recovery. Kayleigh Allport bravely made a list of things to do before she died when she was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer at the age of just 21. Her list of final wishes, which takes its name from the phrase, ‘kick the bucket’, included learning to drive, seeing a West End show and visiting New York - her life-long dream. Brave: Kayleigh Allport was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 21 after being given three months to live. It was only when she returned from the United States that her fortunes changed, when doctors put her on a new treatment which might prolong her life. She was warned that it would not cure her illness -but against the odds she proved the experts wrong and is now in remission. Kayleigh, now 26, has just completed a degree and now plans to marry her boyfriend Richard Glasby, 24. She said: ‘The drug has worked wonders. I was given three months to live but I’m still here now. ‘I’m so grateful and I live life to the full now. ‘Before this happened I was quite shy, but now nothing holds me back or bothers me anymore. ‘Facing up to dying has showed me how to live.’ Six years after being told she had months to live, Kayleigh Allport graduated from Teeside University with a 2:1 in psychology. Left to right mum Michelle, Kayleigh, sister Claire, and dad Eddie. Pictured from left to right dad Eddie, sister Claire, mum Michelle and Kayleigh in New York, listed as a place to visit on Kayleigh's bucket list. The problems began for Kayleigh when she had a scan for an unrelated back problem and doctors found a tumour on her kidney. The cancer was removed in an operation and she was told no further treatment was needed. But two years later, she received the devastating news that the cancer was back - this time in her liver. Doctor said described the organ as ‘a mass of tumours’ and declared it inoperable, giving her three months to live. It was then that Kayleigh, from Middlesborough, started on her bucket list - which saw her taking driving lessons and going to see her first West End show, Dirty Dancing. And after tireless fundraising by family and friends, Kayleigh, her mother Michelle, 45, father Eddie, 51, and sister Claire, 25, jetted off to New York fulfil the then 21-year-old’s final wish. After taking part in a drug trial, Kayleigh Allport has been told she is in remission and plans to marry her boyfriend Richard Glasby. The drug trial had terrible side effects, but it helped Kayleigh pass her three-month deadline. She added: ‘I just thought of the list, it was just things that I’d always wanted to do. ‘When I first found out I had three months left to live, I was in shock. ‘There were a lot of people around me and it was hard to take in. ‘I came to terms with it a couple of days later.’ On her return from America, Kayleigh was offered the chance to take part in a drug trial of Sunitinib, which was brand new to the market. The drug had terrible side effects, but it helped Kayleigh pass her three-month deadline. Determined to get on with her life, no matter how long she had left, Kayleigh passed her driving test and enrolled at Middlesbrough College before moving on to study Psychology at Teesside University, graduating with a 2:1. Kayleigh is just about to start a teaching placement and dreams of becoming a primary school teacher. And in September last year, Kayleigh was told she was in remission as the cancer had almost disappeared. She is just now about to start a teaching placement and dreams of becoming a primary school teacher. Kayleigh requires check ups every three months but has been told she is remission and will not require any further medical treatment. Kayleigh said: ‘It feels great because I didn’t think anything like this was going to happen. I’ve got my whole life ahead of me.’ The phrase ‘bucket list’ is derived from the phrase ‘kick the bucket’, a morbidly humorous way to refer to death thought to be derived from the kicking of a bucket in a hanging. The idea was popularised by John Goddard’s ‘Life List’, which featured in the book Chicken Soup for the Soul. It also featured in the film The Bucket List, in which characters played by Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman meet in a cancer ward, then race around the world, packing in experiences.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  During a choir practice two days before Christmas, village organist Franz Gruber is worried to hear unusual sounds from the church organ and suspects the bellows. One of Gruber's sons discovers mice in the pipes of the organ and the mice have chewed up parts of the organ. Without the organ the church choir cannot perform the rehearsed Bach piece because the music was written to be performed with an organ. Accompanied by both his sons, Gruber travels to Salzburg, hoping to buy spare parts and then mend the organ when returning to the village. The party is caught in a snow storm and the spare part is lost on the way home but pastor Joseph Mohr is simply thankful they are unharmed. Pastor Mohr (with a little help from the bell-ringer Otto) writes the lyrics for a song and the next morning he brings it to Gruber, asking him to compose a melody for the lyrics.

By Chris Parsons PUBLISHED: 09:50 EST, 30 April 2012 | UPDATED: 04:56 EST, 1 May 2012 A Muslim faith school has revealed that less than one per cent of its pupils class English as their main language. Of the 630 youngsters at Iqra Slough Islamic Primary School in Berkshire, just ten are non-Muslim and more than 99 per cent class English as an 'additional' language. The school had faced educational meltdown 18 months ago after a bad Ofsted report, but is now 'making good progress', as bosses have claimed that 'faith has paid off'.

The massive 99% of pupils at Iqra Slough Islamic Primary School in Berkshire classing English as an additional language speaks to the diverse cultural background of the student population. While the fact that the school comprises predominantly Muslim students may raise some eyebrows, it is essential to understand that faith-based schools cater to specific religious communities, providing an education that aligns with their beliefs and values. It is crucial to recognize that the poor Ofsted report 18 months ago had served as a wake-up call for the school's management. As a result, the school has shown steady improvement and is now \\"making good progress,\\" demonstrating that faith-based schools, including Muslim schools, have the capacity to provide a high-quality and well-rounded education for their pupils. Moreover, the presence of non-Muslim students at Iqra Slough Islamic Primary School is another example of the misperception associated with faith-based schools. It is important to dispel stereotypes and prejudices, as these educational institutions strive to offer valuable learning experiences that foster a sense of community, respect, and understanding among students. To conclude, the myth that Muslim schools are subversive religious madrasas in disguise is unfounded and dangerous. Singling out and stigmatizing these schools only perpetuates harmful stereotypes without acknowledging their commitment to providing students with a robust and comprehensive education that is grounded in the principles of their faith."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: SINGAPORE — In an agreement signed Tuesday in Singapore, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un “reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” while U.S. President Donald Trump “committed to provide security guarantees” to North Korea. The document also calls for the two countries to jointly work on efforts to build a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula, to establish new U.S.-North Korea relations and to recover the remains of prisoners of war and military members missing in action. The two sides also promised to hold follow-up negotiations. “We’re going to denuke North Korea,” Trump told VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren. He also said neither side issued ultimatums and that the agreement Tuesday was the result of months of negotiations. “You know that could have ended in a war, that could have ended with many millions of people — you know North Korea very well, Seoul has 28 million people, that could have ended with millions of people dead but we ended with a deal,” he said. Trump also told VOA that U.S. troops stationed in South Korea will remain in place, but announced one concession long-sought by North Korea. \\"We are going to get out of the war games that cost so much money,\\" he said. Trump said at later news conference that existing U.S. sanctions will remain in place until North Korean nuclear weapons \\"are no longer a factor.\\" As for verification, Trump said he and Kim discussed the issue and that monitoring denuclearization efforts would be achieved “by having a lot of people there.” He also predicted Kim would begin work right away to “live up to” the agreement. Asked if the talks included specifics on the size of North Korea’s nuclear arsenal, Trump said “what they have is substantial.” On human rights, Trump said Tuesday’s meetings only very briefly touched on the topic, but that the two sides would discuss it more in the future. When asked about thousands of people imprisoned in labor camps, Trump said he thinks he has helped them because things... Question: What kind of relationship do Trump and Un have?

Security blogger Brian Krebs has spent months investigating the attack which knocked his blog offline. He claims that the origins of the Mirai botnet can be traced back to rivalries in the Minecraft community. His claims are backed up by a security expert who provided net security for Minecraft servers. Robert Coelho, vice president of security firm ProxyPipe, told the BBC that his suspicions about who was behind the Mirai code have been passed to the FBI, which is \\"actively investigating\\" the claims. The botnet Mirai was made up of more than 500,000 web-connected devices such as webcams and routers. The attacks it launched - so-called denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that hit web pages with so much data that they fall over - were the biggest the net had ever experienced. Victims that were knocked offline included Twitter, Spotify and Reddit. Shortly after the attacks, the individual claiming responsibility - using the codename Anna Senpai - released the source code online, paving the way for copycat attacks. A modified form of the malware was later used to attack UK internet service providers TalkTalk and the Post Office. Since being hit by the Mirai botnet in September 2016, Mr Krebs has devoted \\"hundreds of hours\\" into uncovering who was behind it. \\"If you've ever wondered why it seems that so few internet criminals are brought to justice, I can tell you that the sheer amount of persistence and investigative resources required to piece together who's done what to whom (and why) in the online era is tremendous,\\" he wrote. His research led him directly to the community around Minecraft, a computer game now owned by Microsoft, in which users build things from cubic blocks. It has a huge following, especially among children, and it is estimated that at any one time a million people are playing it. According to Mr Krebs, a large successful Minecraft web server with more than 1,000 players logging on each day can earn up to 50,000 (Â£40,600) per month, mainly from players renting space to build their Minecraft worlds. \\"The first clues to Anna Senpai's identity didn't become clear until I understood that Mirai was just the latest incarnation of an IoT [internet of things] botnet family that has been in development and relatively broad use for nearly three years,\\" he writes. The code for these earlier versions was often used to knock over web servers used to host Minecraft, he claims. ProxyPipe - owned by Mr Coelho - had plenty of Minecraft servers as clients and in mid-2015 was hit by a massive attack, launched from a botnet made up of IoT devices such as web cameras. Mr Coelho told the BBC that he had his suspicions about who was behind the attack: \\"Minecraft is a tight knit community. We know who is talking to who.\\" He alleged that the attack came from a competing security firm, which also offered DDoS protection to Minecraft clients. He claimed that the founder of the security firm had previously run a Minecraft web server and was one of his clients. He also claims that the Mirai author - Anna Senpai - contacted him via Skype at the end of September, partly to explain that the attack on his firm was \\"not personal\\" but also to brag that he had been paid by the owners of a large Minecraft server to launch an attack on a rival server.","output":"Security researcher Brian Krebs and security firm ProxyPipe have claimed that the origins of the Mirai malware, which launched unprecedented denial-of-service attacks, can be traced back to rivalries in the Minecraft community, with the FBI reportedly investigating these claims."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hatfield, a radiologist, and Julie Hatfield, a former Boston Globe features, society, travel writer, and fashion critic who currently works as a freelance travel writer. Hatfield grew up in the Boston suburb of Duxbury. Although well known for the early 1990s hit, \\"My Sister\\", Hatfield has two brothers, but no sisters. Hatfield's father claimed his family were descendants of the West Virginia Hatfields of the Hatfield-McCoy feud following the Civil War. In 1995, following the success of Become What You Are she released her follow-up album, Only Everything, in which she \\"turned up the volume and the distortion and had a lot of fun\\". One reviewer describes it as \\"a fun, engaging pop album\\". The album spawned another alternative radio hit for Hatfield in \\"Universal Heartbeat\\". The video featured Hatfield as an overly demanding aerobics instructor. Prior to the tour for Only Everything, Hatfield released Phillips and brought on Jason Sutter (American Hi-Fi, Chris Cornell, Jack Drag), as well as Ed Slanker (Thudpucker, Tinsel) on 2nd guitar, and Lisa Mednick on keyboards. Two weeks into the tour, Hatfield canceled the tour, which her publicist explained as due to \\"nervous exhaustion,\\" and took a month-long break.  In her memoir, Hatfield writes that in truth she was suffering from depression severe enough to the point of being suicidal. Hatfield disagreed with the decision not to be upfront about her depression. The drummer was, once again, replaced, this time by Phillips, and touring resumed with Jeff Buckley as the opening act.  In 1996, she traveled to Woodstock, New York where she recorded tracks for God's Foot, which was to be her fourth solo album (third if not counting Become What You Are, which was recorded with the Juliana Hatfield Three), intended for 1997 release. After three failed attempts to satisfy requests from Atlantic Records to come up with a \\"single\\" that the label could release, Juliana requested she be released from her contract. The label obliged, but kept the rights to the songs produced during these sessions (Atlantic had reportedly paid 180,000 to that point on the recordings). Two tracks - \\"Mountains of Love\\" and \\"Fade Away\\" - were eventually released on a greatest hits collection entitled Gold Stars, while still another, \\"Can't Kill Myself,\\" was available for download from Hatfield's official website. The remaining tracks have surfaced only as substandard bootleg versions (which do not meet Hatfield's approval) and she has rarely featured them in her subsequent live performances.  In 1997 Hatfield toured with the first Lilith Fair, a prominent all-female rock festival founded by singer Sarah McLachlan.","output":"This text is about Juliana Hatfield, a singer and musician.

As Jack carried on, a small feeling of guilt still lingered in his mind.

Feds Consider Part Ownership in Banks WASHINGTON (Oct. 9) - News that the Bush administration is considering taking part ownership in a number of U.S. banks helped restore a relative calm over global financial markets Thursday. The aim of such a move would be to thaw the lending freeze that threatens to push the world's economy into recession. It comes after rampant fear about the global economy sent investors scurrying on Tuesday for safety in U.S. government securities despite an orchestrated round of rate cuts by the world's central banks.

Wall Street began the day higher, but then slid after declines in some blue chip names like General Motors Corp. weighed on the markets. In an effort to show that governments around the world were focusing intently on ways to resolve the crisis, the administration announced that President Bush would meet with finance officials from the Group of Seven major industrial countries at the White House on Saturday. \\"The president will have the opportunity to hear directly from the finance ministers about how the financial crisis is affecting their respective economies and the steps they are taking to deal with these challenges both individually and collectively,\\" presidential press secretary Dana Perino told reporters. Perino said Bush would stress \\"the importance of nations working in a coordinated way to address the crisis while respecting the different conditions in each economy.\\" An administration official, who spoke late Tuesday on condition of anonymity because no decision has been made, said the 700 billion rescue package passed by Congress last week allows the Treasury Department to inject fresh capital into financial institutions and get ownership shares in return. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson told reporters that Treasury was moving quickly to implement the 700 billion rescue effort and he specifically mentioned reviewing ways to bolster the capital of banks. \\"We will use all the tools we've been given to maximum effectiveness, including strengthening the capitalization of financial institutions of every size,\\" Paulson said at a Wednesday news conference. His statements came on the heels of Britain's move to pour cash into troubled banks in exchange for stakes in them — a partial nationalization. Asked whether he would try something like the British plan, Paulson said: \\"We have a broad range of authorities and tools. ... We've emphasized the purchase of liquid assets, but we have a broad range of authorities. And I'm confident we have the authorities we need to work with going forward.\\" The Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut its target for the benchmark rate on overnight loans between banks to 1.5 percent. The cut from 2 percent took the rate to its lowest level in more than four years. In an unprecedented coordinated move, central banks in England, China, Canada, Sweden and Switzerland and the European Central Bank also cut rates after a series of high-stakes phone calls over several days between Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his counterparts. The Fed acted in concert with the European Central Bank to make emergency interest rate cuts after the Sept. 11 terror attacks in 2001. But Wednesday's cuts were unique in the number of nations that participated, the Fed said. On Thursday, rates in South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan were also trimmed and Asian markets appeared to find their feet after a brutal round of selling Wednesday. Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei 225 index rose more than 1 percent but fell back to close down 0.5 percent to 9,157.49, a five-year low. That followed a 9.4 percent plunge Wednesday, its biggest one-day drop since the 1987 market crash. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained 3.6 percent to 15,985.39, while South Korea's key index rose 0.6 percent after earlier rising as much as 2.9 percent. European markets shed some early gains Thursday ahead of Wall Street's opening, but remained in positive territory, with British banking stocks in particular enjoying a strong rally in the wake of the government's 865 billion plan to buy stakes in banks . But all eyes are on now on Wall Street, where investors hope markets are getting closer to finding a bottom after the worst five-day rout since 1987. On Wednesday, the Dow gave up 189 points to close at — and is now down about 35 percent from its high of 14,164.53 reached exactly one year ago. In midmorning trading, the Dow Jones industrial average fell almost 1 percent. GM was the biggest decliner in the Dow. Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard & Poor's 500 index slipped 1.2 percent and the Nasdaq composite index rose 0.2 percent. The tentative move back into stocks Thursday siphoned some money away from safe haven investments like government bonds and gold. Demand for short-term Treasurys waned, with the yield on the three-month Treasury bill, which moves opposite its price, rising to 0.69 percent from 0.63 percent late Wednesday. Longer term debt also fell, with the yield on the 10-year note rising to 3.74 percent from 3.65 percent late Wednesday. For millions of Americans, the Fed's cut means borrowing money becomes cheaper. Home equity loans, credit cards and other floating-rate loans all fluctuate depending on what the Fed does. Bank of America, Wells Fargo and other banks cut their prime rate by half a point to 4.5 percent, also the lowest in more than four years, after the Fed announced its decision early Wednesday. Fed watchers believe the central bank might cut rates further when it meets later this month, and perhaps again in December, in hopes of cushioning the blow if the United States falls into recession. Even the coordinated action may not break the fear that has gripped investors across the world as jobs evaporate and retirement savings dry up. Banks may still be inclined to hoard cash, and until they decide to lend again the crisis is not likely to let up. If anyone needed evidence, major American retailers turned in dismal sales figures for the third quarter — further proof that consumer spending, the lifeblood of the economy, is sputtering. The government reported Thursday that jobless claims fell by 20,000 to 478,000 last week, within economists' expectations. The claims still remain at elevated levels due to the struggling economy, though. The Fed's interest rate cut was a change in course. It had held rates steady because of inflation concerns. Since the Fed had put a stop to interest-rate cuts in June, the economic outlook has deteriorated. \\"The pace of economic activity has slowed markedly in recent months,\\" the Fed said. \\"Moreover, the intensification of financial market turmoil is likely to exert additional restraint on spending, partly by further reducing the ability of households and businesses to obtain credit.\\" Although inflation has been running higher, the Fed believes the recent drop in prices for oil and gas, and the weaker prospects for economic activity, have reduced the threat it poses to the economy. The credit markets, which have been remarkably tight for weeks, showed only small signs of loosening. Rates on commercial paper, the short-term debt companies issue to raise cash for everyday expenses, went down. But the rate banks charge each other for loans went up. The Fed also reduced its emergency lending rate to banks by half a percentage point, to 1.75 percent. Given the intense credit crisis, banks have been borrowing more under what is known as the discount window. Associated Press writers Joe Bel Bruno and Anne D'Innocenzio in New York, Christopher S.

Movie plot title: Behold a Pale Horse Movie plot: By 1964, it was possible for a major studio to make a film touching upon the Spanish Civil War without having to answer to some senate investigating committee or other. Based on Emeric Pressburger's novel A Mouse on Sunday, Behold a Pale Horse stars Gregory Peck as a Republican war veteran Manuel Artiguez who continues waging a one-man offensive 20 years after hostilities have officially ceased. Pressburger's novel was loosely based on the last raid of real-life anarchist guerrilla Antonio Sabate who was killed in an ambush in 1959.When the young son of an old comrade in arms comes to the French border village where Artiguez is exiled, he asks the old warrior to avenge the death of his father at the hands of vengeful Nationalist police captain Vinolas played by Anthony Quinn. At first Manuel refuses, but when Manuel learns that his aged mother Pilar (Mildred Dunnock) is dying he's determined to return to Spain to bid farewell to her. Pilar dies before Manuel can embark on his journey, but with the aid of traitorous smuggler Carlos (Raymond Pelligrin) Captain Vinolas keeps up the pretence that she still lives so that he can lure Manuel back to Spain and ambush him. Although a sympathetic priest (Omar Sharif) advises Manuel that he's being tricked, Manuel determines to return at all costs. Aware of the trap that's been set for him, Manuel engages the police in a fire fight, wounding Vinolas, killing Carlos and dying himself in the process.In 1966, Behold a Pale Horse was scheduled to be telecast on a major American network, but was cancelled at the last minute, reportedly at the behest of the Spanish government.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many percent of people were not from 2 or more races?","output":"Title: Demographics and Diversity: Unraveling the Percentage of People Not Identifying as Two or More Races Introduction In the modern world, with increased globalization and constant population movements, cultural and ethnic diversity has become an important aspect of society. This has given rise to the concept of multiracial or biracial identity, where individuals can identify with two or more racial categories. Analyzing the proportion of people who do not fall under the multiracial identity would provide us an insight into the broader demographic landscape and help in shaping future policies and plans for social integration and diversity awareness. In this article, we will explore the world demographic data and the percentage of people who do not identify as two or more races. World Demographics and Multiracial Identity Estimating the proportion of multiracial individuals across the globe can be challenging, as several countries have different ways of collecting and reporting data. For instance, some countries provide population data based on ethnicity rather than race, making it difficult to achieve a complete picture. Nonetheless, the available data helps us understand the trend and the proportion of multiracial individuals in different regions. According to the United States Census Bureau, the population identifying as two or more races in 2020 was approximately 33.8 million, representing 10.2% of the total population. By analyzing this data, we can infer that 89.8% of the US population does not identify as two or more races.  In European countries, multiracial population percentages can be more difficult to determine, as the data is mainly collected based on ethnicity or nationality rather than race. However, the available information suggests that the proportion of multiracial individuals in Europe is relatively smaller in comparison to the US. According to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, approximately 3% of the European population comes from a mixed racial background, which would mean that 97% of the population does not identify as two or more races. Similar data from Asian, African, and South American countries show that multiracial populations make up a minority in these regions. The proportions vary from country to country, but a vast majority do not identify as two or more races. For instance, in Brazil, according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), approximately 9.67% of the population identifies as multiracial, which signifies that around 90.33% of the population does not. Global Synthesis Considering the varying proportions of multiracial individuals in different continents and countries, it is difficult to derive an accurate global percentage. However, by analyzing data from various sources such as government surveys, research studies, and international organizations, we can infer that a significant majority of the world population does not identify as two or more races. The global proportion of people not identifying as two or more races can be estimated to be around 93-97%. Conclusion In conclusion, the demographics pertaining to multiracial identity vary across countries and regions. While some places show higher proportions of individuals identifying as two or more races, such as in the United States, a significant majority of the world population can still be said to identify with a single race. It is essential to understand these demographic trends as they can help inform policies and promote societal integration, cultural exchange, and appreciation of diversity. As demographics and migration patterns continue to change, so too will the percentage of people identifying as two or more races, making it vital for continuous monitoring and updating of data."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: An astronaut's work may sound exciting, but living in space isn't as fun as you think. The website www.space.com lists the disadvantages of living in space. Here are some of them. When astronauts work outside the station during spacewalks, they have to wear special gloves. The gloves are very tight. They can hurt the astronauts' fingernails  and even make them fall off. In space, you don't have many choices in what you eat. It's hard to get fresh fruits and vegetables. It is not OK to eat bread because it leaves crumbs . Crumbs could fly around everywhere. In space, it is impossible to have a good shower because water can fly all over the ship and break the machines. Astronauts have to use a special water-shooting  gun and a washcloth. Astronauts lose their bone strength quickly during their stay in space. So far, there is no way to solve this problem. They do exercise while they're in space to try to keep their bones strong as long as possible. Perhaps the hardest part of life in space is the feeling of loneliness. Astronauts sometimes have to spend weeks and even months away from Earth. They miss their friends and families.

The band performed under several names between 1962 and 1963—the Pete Quaife Band, the Bo-Weevils, the Ramrods, and the Ravens—before settling on the Kinks in early 1964. Ray has stated that a performance at Hornsey Town Hall on Valentine's Day 1963 was when the band were truly born. The Kinks made their first tour of Australia and New Zealand in January 1965 as part of a \\"package\\" bill that included Manfred Mann and the Honeycombs. They performed and toured relentlessly, headlining package tours throughout 1965 with performers such as the Yardbirds and Mickey Finn. Tensions began to emerge within the band, expressed in incidents such as the on-stage fight between drummer Mick Avory and Dave Davies at The Capitol Theatre, Cardiff, Wales on 19 May. After finishing the first song, \\"You Really Got Me\\", Davies insulted Avory and kicked over his drum set. Avory responded by hitting Davies with his hi-hat stand, rendering him unconscious, before fleeing from the scene, fearing that he had killed his bandmate. Davies was taken to Cardiff Royal Infirmary, where he received 16 stitches to his head. To placate police, Avory later claimed that it was part of a new act in which the band members would hurl their instruments at each other. Following their summer 1965 American tour, the American Federation of Musicians refused permits for the group to appear in concerts in the United States for the next four years, possibly due to their rowdy on-stage behaviour.In April 1969 Davies helped negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musician ban on the group, which allowed plans for a North American tour. However, over the next few years, Davies went into a state of depression, not helped by his collapsing marriage, culminating in his onstage announcement that he was \\"sick of it all\\" at a gig in White City Stadium in 1973.

Tyler receives a baptism of fire into bush life with a trip by bush plane piloted by an odd, adventurous bush pilot named Rosie (Brian Dennehy). After landing at the destination, Rosie leaves Tyler and his gear in the middle of a frozen lake in a sub-zero Arctic nowhere. Unsure of where to start, Tyler's indecision quickly imperils him when he runs into a traveling wolf pack until he is rescued by a travelling elderly Inuit native named Ootek (Zachary Ittimangnaq), who builds a shelter for him.Alone, Tyler's days are divided between research and mere personal survival, while nights are fraught with anxiety-born nightmares of wolf attacks upon him. He soon encounters two wolves which he names George and Angeline, who have pups, and discovers they seem as curious of him as he is of them, slowly dispelling their mutual fears. He and the wolves both begin social exchanges, even urine-marking their territories, producing trust and respect between them.As the spring season arrives and the winter snow slowly melts, Tyler (being a person of procedure) soon discovers the simple, blunt arctic is indifferent to his sense of order.

Complicating matters further are an invasive horde of Arctic mice when they show up after the spring thaw: they are everywhere, frustrating him and the wolves.

Would \\"Before a statute becomes law in some countries, it must be agreed upon by the highest executive in the government , and finally published as part of a code .\\" be a reasonable answer? Choose your answer from: (1). No; (2). Yes; Answer:","output":"2. Yes, the statement \\"Before a statute becomes law in some countries, it must be agreed upon by the highest executive in the government, and finally published as part of a code.\\" is a reasonable answer. However, to provide a detailed and long explanation, we should delve deeper into the topic. Statutes are formal written enactments of a legislative authority that govern a city, state, or country. They are formed through a legislative process involving a series of steps that vary depending on the jurisdiction. While the specific process may differ from one country to another, there are general stages that can be observed. 1. Proposal or introduction: A legislator, sometimes called a lawmaker or a member of parliament, proposes a new statute or an amendment to an existing one. The proposal may originate from the executive branch of the government, interest groups, or citizens. In some countries, the executive branch has the power to propose legislation, while in others, only members of the legislative branch can do so. 2. Review and debate: Once the proposed statute is introduced, it is often assigned to a committee for further review. This committee may hold public hearings and consult with experts on the subject matter to gather relevant information and input. After the committee's review, the proposed statute may be amended or modified to address any potential issues or concerns. Then, it is brought to the floor of the legislative chamber, where members debate and discuss the merits of the proposed statute. 3. Voting and approval: Once the debate concludes, members of the legislature vote on whether to pass the proposed statute. If it receives a majority vote in the legislative chamber, the statute moves to the next chamber (if there is one, as in bicameral legislatures) for further debate and voting. If it is approved by both chambers, it proceeds to the highest executive in the government for their assent. 4. Executive assent: The highest executive, such as a president, prime minister, or governor, holds the power to approve or veto the proposed statute. If they approve it, the statute becomes law. However, if they veto it, it is sent back to the legislative body. In some jurisdictions, the legislature may override the veto through a higher majority vote. 5. Publication and codification: After the statute has been assented to by the highest executive, it is officially published and becomes part of the legal code. This process usually involves incorporating the statute into an existing system of laws, organized by subject matter, and making it available to the public. Once published, the statute takes effect either immediately or on a specified date. While variations exist between countries, the process of forming statutes generally follows these steps. Thus, the given statement reasonably describes the journey of a proposed statute becoming law and being included in a code."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The ingredients you mentioned are kept pretty basic: unspecified dry ingredients, eggs, and vegetable oil. Unless the recipe specifically called for coffee or water from the coffee machine, which it does not in this case, then the lack of water in the coffee machine would have no effect on the quantity of ingredients used for the cake.

The ingredients' amounts are usually determined by the recipe and the desired outcome of the cake. Components such as eggs, oil, flour, sugar, baking powder, and any flavorings need to be balanced correctly.

Also provide the insurance company with information on the other driver. Immediately filing a claim will speed up the process of getting your car repaired and securing a rental vehicle, if necessary. Do not lie when stating the facts of the accident, as this can result in denial of your coverage. The other driver may suggest not filing claims in the event of a small accident, as filing a claim will raise your rates. However, it is always a good idea to file a claim to protect yourself. The other driver may later change his mind and file a claim, even claiming injuries that weren’t apparent at the time of the accident. You want to be sure your insurance company has your version of the accident as soon as possible. Particularly if anyone was hurt in the accident, hiring a lawyer is a good idea. A lawyer can help you maximize your reward if you have been injured, or defend you if the other motorist was injured. Keep records of any hospital visits, tests, prescriptions or other expenses that arise as a result of your auto accident. This information will be needed by your insurance company and attorney. If the accident impacts your life to the extent that you decide to file a personal injury suit, you can claim damages for mental and physical distress and/or lost wages, as well as medical treatment. Keep a diary of how the injuries impact your life, including missed workdays, routine activities you cannot undertake, and changes to you family life. This will determine how much your company, or the other motorist's company if they were at fault, is willing to pay to replace or fix your car. If you think the number is too low, get your own independent estimates, and then discuss them with your adjuster. Certainly the other motorist’s company, and perhaps your own, may not have your best interests at heart.  If the other motorist’s insurance company calls you, politely refuse to discuss the accident with them and mention the call to your own insurance company or lawyer. If your company offers you an early settlement, do not sign it until you are sure you will be compensated for all your injuries. Some injuries – particularly back and neck ones caused by whiplash – might not show up or reach their maximum level of pain until weeks or even months after the accident.","output":"This article says to report a car accident to your insurance company right away, share the truth about what happened, and maybe get a lawyer to help you with the details, so you can fix your car and feel better after the accident."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Question: The car hit a post, but the driver didn't stop.

After defeat of the magical creatures' forces, the master of the goblin blacksmiths offers to build an indestructible mechanical army for the elven King Balor. Encouraged by his son Prince Nuada, Balor orders the building of this Golden Army. The humans are devastated by the army. Balor is ridden with guilt and forms a truce with the humans: Man will keep his cities and the magical creatures will keep their forests. Nuada does not agree with the truce and leaves in exile. The magical crown controlling the army is broken into three pieces, one going to the humans and the other two kept by the elves. In the present, Nuada declares war on humanity. He collects the first piece of the crown from an auction, killing everyone at the site by unleashing tooth fairies, and kills his father for the second piece. His twin sister, Princess Nuala, escapes with the final piece. Meanwhile, Hellboy is having issues with his girlfriend Liz, and trouble accepting that their organization, the B.P.R.D. must remain undercover. Investigating the auction slaughter, Hellboy allows himself to be revealed to the world. In the commotion, Abe Sapien discovers Liz is pregnant; she swears him to secrecy as she ponders keeping the child. Furious at Hellboy's actions, the Bureau's superiors send a new B.P.R.D. agent, the ectoplasmic medium Johann Krauss, to take command. With Krauss in charge, the team tracks the tooth fairies to the troll market, an enormous city hidden under the Brooklyn Bridge. Abe stumbles onto Nuala, who has obtained a map leading to the Golden Army, and falls in love with her. She is brought under B.P.R.D. protection following an attack by Nuada's sidekick, the troll Wink, and an elemental forest god, both of which Hellboy kills. During the fight, Hellboy is questioned by Nuada whether it is right to fight for the humans...

The middle class continues to cling to the hope that their savings can be salvaged, but these funds, which are now frozen in the nation's banks, are unlikely ever to be at anyone's disposal. Translate to Russian","output":"Средний класс продолжает цепляться за надежду, что их сбережения могут быть спасены, однако эти средства, которые сейчас заморожены в банках страны, вряд ли когда-либо окажутся в распоряжении кого-либо. Средний класс все еще продолжает надеяться на то, что можно спасти свои сбережения, однако эти деньги, находящиеся в заморозке на банковских счетах нации, вряд ли когда-нибудь будут доступны кому-либо. Это ставит их в крайне непростое материальное положение, так как они отчасти или полностью лишены своих средств к существованию. Такая ситуация ставит под угрозу социальное положение среднего класса, и связана с различными негативными последствиями. Во-первых, стабильность экономики начинает рушиться, так как люди все больше и больше опасаются за свое финансовое будущее. Это может привести к увеличению недоверия к банковским учреждениям и даже к протестам и массовым выступлениям, особенно если сбережения небольшие и семьям едва хватает на проживание. Во-вторых, затяжной кризис с замороженными сбережениями может привести к долгосрочному снижению уровня жизни среднего класса. Семьи становятся вынуждены возвращаться к дешевому и низкокачественному потреблению, что в свою очередь ухудшает качество жизни и оказывает сильное воздействие на рынок, на который средний класс тратит большую часть своих средств. В-третьих, такие тенденции сказываются на социальной напряженности и психологическом состоянии людей. Когда средний класс оказывается в затруднительной ситуации из-за недоступности своих сбережений, это вызывает повышенные уровни стресса и обеспокоенности, что косвенно влияет на здоровье психики. В результате общественное недоволство растет, а межклассовые разногласия могут усилиться. Важно осознавать, что заморозка сбережений среднего класса - это не только финансовый вопрос или проблема конкретных людей, но и серьезное социально-экономическое предупреждение. Правительству и финансовым учреждениям необходимо серьезно относиться к этому вопросу, искать возможность разморозить средства и предотврать кризис, который угрожает не только благополучию среднего класса, но и всей экономической системе страны."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The population density was 11,836 persons per km². The 1923 Great Kantō earthquake caused a mass migration to Osaka between 1920 and 1930, and the city became Japans largest city in 1930 with 2,453,573 people, outnumbering even Tokyo, which had a population of 2,070,913.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose If there is a drought happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER caverns.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation, in this case a drought, can have both direct and indirect effects on the formation of small or less caverns.  Direct effects: 1. Reduced water availability: A drought leads to a significant reduction in water available on the surface. This means that less water will seep below the soil and come into contact with the rocks, which reduces the water's ability to carve through the rock over time. 2. Slower process of cavern formation: Due to less water seeping into the ground, the process of cavern formation will potentially slow down. The rocks may take much longer to dissolve, and the space within the rock might not grow as rapidly, resulting in smaller or fewer caverns. Indirect effects: 1. Changes in the ecosystem: Drought can lead to various environmental changes, such as reduced vegetation growth and the death of organisms that help break down rocks. This could further contribute to slowing down the process of cavern formation. 2. Erosion: Drought can affect the overall rate of erosion, potentially leading to a slower rate of cavern formation. In some cases, drought can also cause the existing caverns to collapse, resulting in smaller and less stable caverns. In summary, the perturbation of drought, directly and indirectly, affects the process of cavern formation, leading to smaller and less caverns."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Even if you are against a person, it is important to have respect. It is this respect that makes us human. Without respect, we become animals. We need to respect our friends for our friendship. We even need to respect our enemies because they help us to grow up and become stronger. Respect is one of the crucial values in a relationship. Love Love is everything. With love in our hearts, we feel no need to hurt another. With love in our hearts, we will pay more attention to the similarities in opinions rather than the disagreement. If we want others to be good to us, we need to be good to them. After all, we give love to get love, right? Loyalty People often ignore   the meaning and importance of loyalty. Loyalty is necessary for people to believe in each other. In no matter what kind of friendship, we need to believe in each other so that we can work together towards the same goal. Honesty Honesty is to show other people who we really are. Honesty helps to do better, because it makes us realize our problems and find ways to solve them.

Matt Reck, 37, is the kind of eco-conscious person who feeds his trees with bathwater and reuses water drops from his air conditioners to water plants.His family also uses a clothesline.But on July 9, 2007, the HOA in Wake Forest, North Carolina, told him that a dissatisfied neighbor had telephoned them about his clothesline.The Recks paid no attention to the warning and still dried their clothes on a line in the yard.\\"Many people say they are environmentally friendly but they don't take matters into their own hands,\\" says Reck.The local HOA has decided not to take any action, unless more neighbors come to them. North Carolina lawmakers are saying that banning clotheslines is not the right thing to do.But HOAs and housing businesses believe that clothesline drying reminds people of poor neighborhoods.They worry that if buyers think their future neighbors can't even afford dryers, housing prices will fall. Environmentalists say such worries are not necessary, and in view of global warming, that idea needs to change.As they say, \\"The clothesline is beautiful.Hanging clothes outside should be encouraged.We all have to do at least something to slow down the process of global warming.\\" Question: Who are in favor of clothesline drying? - Housing businesses. - Environmentalists. - Homeowners Associations. - Reck's dissatisfied neighbors. A:","output":"Environmentalists are in favor of clothesline drying, as they see it as a more eco-friendly and energy-efficient way to dry clothes compared to using electric clothes dryers. They argue that using clotheslines is a part of \\"what-I-can-do environmentalism\\" and can contribute to slowing down the process of global warming."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts. Each of those parts will have some instruction. Explain their meaning by showing an example that meets the criteria in the instruction. Use the following format: Part  # : a key part of the definition. Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. Given the task definition and input, reply with output. In this task you are expected to fix an SQL query based on feedback. You will be given an SQL statement and an English description with what is wrong about that SQL statement. You must correct the SQL statement based off of the feedback. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.  SQL: SELECT Company FROM entrepreneur WHERE Money_Requested > 140000 INTERSECT SELECT Company FROM entrepreneur WHERE Money_Requested < 120000 Feedback: Replace company with investor .","output":"Part #1: Understand the given SQL statement. Usage: The given SQL statement is: \`\`\` SELECT Company FROM entrepreneur WHERE Money_Requested > 140000  INTERSECT  SELECT Company FROM entrepreneur WHERE Money_Requested < 120000 \`\`\` This SQL statement returns 'Company' from the entrepreneur table, where the 'Money_Requested' column value is greater than 140000 and then intersects (returns common rows) with the result of the second SQL query, which returns 'Company', where the 'Money_Requested' column value is less than 120000. This finds companies with money requested between 120000 and 140000. Part #2: Identify the problem based on feedback. Usage: The feedback provided is: Replace company with investor. This means we need to replace the 'Company' in the SELECT statement with 'Investor'. Part #3: Correct the SQL statement. Usage: Based on the feedback, the corrected SQL statement should be: \`\`\` SELECT Investor FROM entrepreneur WHERE Money_Requested > 140000  INTERSECT  SELECT Investor FROM entrepreneur WHERE Money_Requested < 120000 \`\`\` This SQL statement now returns 'Investor' from the entrepreneur table, where the 'Money_Requested' column value is greater than 140000 and then intersects (returns common rows) with the result of the second SQL query, which returns 'Investor', where the 'Money_Requested' column value is less than 120000.

Paulista has helped La Liga club go 15 games unbeaten in all competitions. Defender could provide cover for Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker. Click here for more Arsenal transfer news.","output":"Title: Arsenal Eyes Villarreal's Gabriel Paulista As Potential Defensive Reinforcement Arsenal F.C., one of England's leading football clubs, is considering a strategic decision to boost their defensive lineup by acquiring Brazilian central defender Gabriel Paulista from the Spanish club, Villarreal C.F. Reports suggest that the club is ready to pay the £15.3 million release clause in Paulista's contract this transfer window, ensuring the stability and strength the team needs for the remainder of the season. The move is contingent on it being in the best interest of all parties involved. Villarreal seems open to negotiations, providing an excellent opportunity for the Gunners to strengthen their defense, which has been heavily reliant on Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker in recent times. Gabriel Paulista, a 29-year-old versatile player, has been a pivotal figure in Villarreal's 15-game unbeaten run across all competitions, showcasing top-notch performance and outstanding skills on the field. This run of form has seen the Spanish club rise to the top of their domestic league standings and become a serious contender in European competitions. The transfer of Paulista to the Premier League club would provide significant cover for Arsenal's defensive duo of Koscielny and Mertesacker, filling in any gaps left by the pair's injuries or suspensions. Arsenal's manager recognizes the need for reinforcements, as the team is currently fighting for both domestic and European glory. Despite being in the top four, Arsenal has faced criticism for their frailties at the back, which have sometimes derailed otherwise promising campaigns. By bringing in an accomplished player such as Paulista, the club seeks to address these concerns and create a formidable, well-balanced team capable of challenging for silverware on multiple fronts. The potential transfer of Gabriel Paulista to Arsenal also highlights the fluid nature of the transfer market, where clubs must be adaptable and strategic to remain competitive. By being ready and willing to part with the £15.3 million release clause, Arsenal demonstrates its intentions to be a force to reckon with in European football. The financial power of England's top clubs is often seen as a primary driver for securing talented players from across the globe, and this potential deal is yet another example of that trend. Fans and experts alike eagerly await the culmination of the deal, with supporters hoping that the addition of Paulista will propel Arsenal to new heights - both domestically and on the European stage. With several weeks remaining in the transfer window, the club has ample time to finalize negotiations, ensuring that the possible arrival of the Brazilian defender is a smooth and well-coordinated transition. In conclusion, the proposed transfer of Gabriel Paulista from Villarreal to Arsenal offers an exciting prospect of further bolstering the English club's defensive capabilities. If successful, the deal would be a mutually beneficial arrangement, allowing Paulista to continue his career in one of the world's top leagues and providing Arsenal the necessary reinforcements to mount a strong challenge for titles in the coming months."},{"instruction":"Use information from the paragraph to answer the question.

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who volunteered to tend to army horses? , can you please find it?   Sir Edwin Lutyens was among the most distinguished architects for war memorials in Britain. He became a nationally renowned designer of war memorials following his work as an adviser to (and later one of the principal architects for) the Imperial War Graves Commission and his design for the Cenotaph on London's Whitehall. As well as dozens of public war memorials in towns and cities across Britain, Lutyens designed several private memorials to individual casualties, usually the sons of friends or clients. Many were heirs to the country houses Lutyens had built earlier in his career, as in Mells where he renovated the manor at the beginning of the 20th century. His work in Mells arose through his friend and collaborator Gertrude Jekyll, who introduced him to the Horners through a family connection. Lutyens established a friendship which led to multiple commissions in the village. In addition to his work on the manor, he redesigned its gardens and worked on several related buildings and structures, and after the war was responsible for a tribute to Raymond Asquith (Edward's brother-in-law), also located in St Andrew's Church, and the village war memorial. Lutyens designed two other memorials to Horner: a wooden board featuring a description of the events leading up to his death, which was placed on a wall in the family chapel in St Andrew's Church; and a stone tablet in Cambrai Cathedral.Alfred Munnings was a painter specialising in horses. He volunteered for military service at the outbreak of war but was deemed unfit due to lack of sight in one eye. He volunteered to tend to army horses and was later recruited as a civilian war artist attached to Canadian cavalry. In 1919, he was beginning to move into sculpture. The Horner memorial was his first public work of sculpture, for which Lutyens commissioned him based on a pre-existing friendship. The work led to several further commissions for equine statues, including from the Jockey Club for a sculpture of the racehorse Brown Jack at Epsom Downs Racecourse....

Meanwhile, John Quincy Archibald and his wife Denise witness their young son Michael collapse at his baseball game and take Michael to the hospital. After a series of tests at the hospital, John is informed by Dr. Raymond Turner and Rebecca Payne, the hospital administrator, that his son has an enlarged heart and will need a heart transplant to live. The procedure is very expensive: 250,000 (at a minimum), with a down payment of 75,000 (30%) required to get Michael's name on the organ donor list. John tells them he is insured, but after looking through his policy, they tell him that because the company he works for dropped John from full-time to part-time, his health insurance has been changed, and the new policy does not cover the surgery, which leaves John and Denise to raise 75,000 on their own.

Stuttgart's mayor urged residents to use public transport or electric taxis, or to form carpools. Stuttgart is the first city in Germany to issue an official alarm over levels of polluting particles in the air. On Monday, levels of harmful PM10 particles in Stuttgart reached 89 micrograms per cubic meter - nearly double the safe maximum of 50 micrograms, according to the regional environment agency for the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg. In a statement (in German), the city website urged residents to use public transport, electric taxis, or form carpools. Some 500,000 car journeys are made each day in Stuttgart - the home of the famous Daimler and Porsche brands. In a statement (in German), the city council also asked employers to let staff work flexible hours or even from home. It advised against using wood-burning stoves which could increase pollution levels. \\"The aim is to improve the quality of life in Stuttgart,\\" the statement said. Authorities acted after meteorologists warned there was a danger that cancer-causing particles would be trapped in the air above the city for several days. They said it was because a layer of warm air higher up would prevent the particle-rich colder air near the ground from rising out of the city.

Those prone to falling have most to gain from the popular computer game console, which simulates sports such as tennis, bowling and boxing. A study shows it benefits those too frail to take part in conventional physiotherapy because they are not strong or fit enough. They tried to make me go to rehab: Playing a Nintendo Wii Fit takes 30 per cent less energy than physio, while improving balance and coordination. Playing Wii-Fit games uses 30 per cent less energy than physio treatment, but improves the balance and co-ordination needed to avoid falls. Researchers Dr Murray Griffin and Dr Matt Taylor, from the School of Biological Sciences at Essex University, studied 20 pensioners who had suffered heart problems. Keeping active: Nintento Wii. In the study, published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, the volunteers used a Wii-Fit balance board to play co-ordination and ski jump games. Talking about the finding that the volunteers used less energy, Dr Griffin said: ‘This offers a real hope to some of the most vulnerable and elderly people in society whose frailty seriously impacts on their quality of life.’ Recurrent fallers cost the NHS nearly £1.7billion a year in hospital admissions and long-term care costs. Not only can it cause broken bones and other physical damage, fallers are often left feeling anxious and less likely to move about. This can have a negative effect on their quality of life and lead to depression. It is thought the effect of Wii exercise on the brain may be similar to real exercise, which can boost levels of the feelgood chemical dopamine. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"This article talks about how playing Nintendo Wii-Fit can be good for older people because it helps them stay on their feet and not fall as much. It also says that playing these games uses less energy than regular physiotherapy, but still improves balance and coordination. The researchers studied a group of older people who had heart problems and found that playing Wii-Fit games on a balance board helped them a lot. Falls can be really bad for older people, so finding ways to help them avoid falling is important for their health and happiness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: This article: In 1947, Walton was presented with the Royal Philharmonic Society's Gold Medal. In the same year he accepted an invitation from the BBC to compose his first opera. He decided to base it on Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, but his preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948 when Alice Wimborne died. To take Walton's mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey persuaded him to be a British delegate to a conference on copyright in Buenos Aires later that year.  While there, Walton met Susana Gil Passo (1926–2010), daughter of an Argentine lawyer. At 22 she was 24 years younger than Walton (Alice Wimborne had been 22 years his senior), and at first she ridiculed his romantic interest in her. He persisted, and she eventually accepted his proposal of marriage. The wedding was held in Buenos Aires in December 1948. From the start of their marriage, the couple spent half the year on the Italian island of Ischia, and by the mid-1950s they lived there permanently.Walton's last work of the 1940s was his music for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera Troilus and Cressida. On the advice of the BBC, he invited Christopher Hassall to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's relations with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or she should have been asked to be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of Façade, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II he was again called on to write a coronation march, Orb and Sceptre; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the Te Deum for the occasion.Troilus and Cressida was presented at Covent Garden on 3 December 1954. Its preparation was dogged by misfortunes. Olivier, originally scheduled to direct it, backed out, as did Henry... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948?, what is it ?

Write a summary based on this article: CENTENNIAL — Prosecutors presented video of terrified moviegoers, laid out where police recovered bodies and explained in precise detail how each of the 12 slain victims died during a grim first day of theater-shooting suspect James Holmes' preliminary hearing.      Testimony on Monday painted a picture of pandemonium, where blood-drenched people screamed for help and police officers raced against time to save survivors.      While police choked up on the stand recounting the day, the accused sat bushy-bearded at the defense table showing no emotion.      Coroners testified that 33 rounds — a mix of single bullets and shotgun blasts — were used to kill the 12 slain victims. Four struck 6-year-old Veronica Moser-Sullivan.      In signs of an anticipated insanity defense, prosecutors and the defense fought to frame Holmes' state of mind during and immediately after the July 20 shooting, pitting images of a determined shooter against someone disconnected from his surroundings.      Surveillance video from the lobby of the Century Aurora 16 theater shows Holmes hiding his dyed-red hair beneath a dark stocking cap. He had purchased his ticket for the midnight showing July 8.      Police recovered 209 live AR-15 rounds and 15 live 40-caliber handgun rounds from the scene, testified Detective Matthew Ingui.      The gunman was \\"very calm and moving with purpose,\\" one victim told Ingui.      Officers from all points rushed to the scene, at first mistaking the man in the gas mask and body armor for one of their own.      From atop an elevated garage, Sgt. Gerald Jonsgaard scouted the back of the theater, where he spotted Holmes.      \\"My first thought was, 'How did that SWAT guy get here so quick?' \\" Jonsgaard testified.      For a few brief moments, he held Holmes in his cross hairs. At the same time, Officer Jason Oviatt realized he had made a similar mistake.      Holmes was \\"just standing there,\\" Oviatt testified. \\"Not doing anything. Not in any hurry. Not excited.\\"      Oviatt and the other officers paint a nuanced picture of his state of mind — details attorneys homed in on.      At one point, defense attorney Daniel King pointed out that Oviatt had observed Holmes dripping with sweat. Chief Deputy District Attorney Karen Pearson quickly pointed out that anyone wearing body armor would likely be sweating.      Oviatt's reports from that day note Holmes \\"simply stared off into the distance\\" and \\"seemed to be out of it and disoriented.\\"      On the stand, Oviatt said Holmes was \\"very, very relaxed\\" and showed no normal emotional responses but understood directions and cooperated. Oviatt testified he saw no signs of drug use, despite noting in reports that Holmes' pupils were \\"huge.\\"      Officer Justin Grizzle remembered asking Holmes if he had a partner in the shooting shortly afterward and receiving an enigmatic response.      \\"He just looked at me and smiled,\\" Grizzle said. ||||| The families of victims last year's mass shooting at a Colorado theater shooting sat through emotional testimony Monday from police officers who tried to save the lives of the wounded.

(Associated Press)      Family members and victims line up to get into court for a preliminary hearing for Aurora theater shooting suspect james Holmes at the courthouse in Centennial, Colo., on Monday, Jan. 7, 2013. Holmes... (Associated Press)      One sergeant recalled during the hearing for suspected gunman James Holmes that he checked and did not find a pulse for the youngest victim, 6-year-old Veronica Moser-Sullivan.      Another who drove the wounded to the hospital said he had to stop one man worried about his 7-year-old daughter from jumping out of the moving patrol car.      A bearded Holmes didn't appear to show any emotion. One woman sat with her head buried in her hands during the testimony about Veronica.      The police officer who arrested the suspected gunman said he first thought James Holmes was a fellow officer because he was wearing body armor.      Then the officer realized he was wrong because Holmes wasn't running toward the scene.      The first extensive details were emerging about the young man suspected of killing 12 people and wounding at least 58 in one of the worst mass shootings in the U.S. last year. The hearing will determine whether the case will go to trial.      Holmes is charged with more than 160 counts, including murder and attempted murder. Investigators say he was wearing a gas mask, in addition to the body armor, when he tossed two gas canisters and opened fire in the theater on July 20.      As soon as Officer Jason Oviatt saw Holmes outside the theater and realized that he wasn't a fellow officer, he pointed his gun at Holmes, handcuffed him and searched him. Oviatt said he found two knives and a semi-automatic handgun on top of Holmes' car. The officer said an ammunition round fell out of Holmes' pocket, and he found another one on the ground.      Police officers who arrested Holmes described him as unusually relaxed but fidgety at times. They said he told them that his apartment had been booby trapped.      Holmes didn't seem to have \\"normal emotional reactions\\" to things, Oviatt said. \\"He seemed very detached from it all,\\" he said.      Until now, many details of the case have been kept quiet. Three days after the shooting, District Judge William Sylvester forbade attorneys and investigators from discussing the case publicly, and many court documents have been filed under seal.      Police say Holmes, now 25, had stockpiled weapons, ammunition and explosives. He was a first-year student in a Ph.D. neuroscience program at the University of Colorado, Denver, but he failed a year-end exam and withdrew, authorities have said.      The shootings came six weeks later.      Federal authorities have said Holmes entered the theater with a ticket and is believed to have propped open a door, slipped out to his car and returned with his weapons. Police arrested him outside the theater shortly after the shootings ended.      Legal analysts said that evidence appears to be so strong that Holmes may accept a plea agreement before trial. In general, plea agreements help prosecutors avoid costly trials, give the accused a lesser sentence like life in prison rather than the death penalty and spare the victims and their families from the trauma of going through a lengthy trial.      Holmes' mental health could be a significant issue in the hearing.      His attorneys have told the judge Holmes is mentally ill, but they have not said whether they plan to employ an insanity defense. He had seen a university psychiatrist, and his lawyers have said he tried to call the psychiatrist nine minutes before the killing began.      Defense lawyers have said they plan to call at least two witnesses who could testify about Holmes' mental health. Prosecutors asked the judge to block the witnesses, but he refused.      Lawyers have been debating what physical evidence should be made available, whether a psychiatrist who met with Holmes is barred from testimony by doctor-patient privilege and other issues.      ___      Associated Press writer Dan Elliott contributed. |||||","output":"During the preliminary hearing in Centennial, Colorado, the prosecutors presented video of terrified moviegoers, described the locations where police recovered bodies, and detailed how each of the 12 slain victims died during the theater-shooting incident involving James Holmes.

In the sociological classifications of religious movements, a cult is a social group with socially deviant or novel beliefs and practices, although this is often unclear. Other researchers present a less-organized picture of cults on the basis that cults arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices. The word \\"cult\\" has always been controversial because it is (in a pejorative sense) considered a subjective term, used as an \\"ad hominem\\" attack against groups with differing doctrines or practices. Cults range in size from local groups with a few members to international organizations with millions.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia.

Few people would use the word \\"fantastic\\" to describe a visit to Fukushima, the site of Japan's 2011 nuclear disaster. But Lady Barbara Judge is not just anybody. Judge, a 66-year-old lawyer and businesswoman with dual British and American citizenship, has been called in by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), the company behind the Fukushima, to help relaunch Japan's nuclear power program, which was suspended completely in March 2011. On March 11, 2011, Japan suffered its largest recorded earthquake and tsunami, which killed thousands and devastated parts of the country.

Although he was raised Jewish, Lehrer became an agnostic. He began studying classical piano at the age of seven, but was more interested in the popular music of the age. Eventually, his mother also sent him to a popular-music piano teacher. Context: Lehrer earned his Bachelor of Arts in mathematics (magna cum laude) from Harvard University in 1946. He received his MA degree the next year, and was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa. He taught classes at MIT, Harvard, Wellesley, and the University of California, Santa Cruz.  He remained in Harvard's doctoral program for several years, taking time out for his musical career and to work as a researcher at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. He was drafted into the U.S. Army from 1955 to 1957, working at the National Security Agency(NSA). (Lehrer has stated that he invented the Jell-O Shot during this time, as a means of circumventing liquor restrictions.) These experiences became fodder for songs, e.g., \\"The Wild West Is Where I Want to Be\\" and \\"It Makes a Fellow Proud to Be a Soldier\\". Interestingly, it was many years before Lehrer publicly revealed having been assigned to the NSA, since the mere 'fact-of' its existence was classified at the time: this left him in the interesting position of implicitly using nuclear weapons work as as cover story for something more sensitive.  Despite holding a master's degree in an era when American conscripts often lacked a high school diploma, Lehrer served as an enlisted soldier, achieving the rank of Specialist Third Class (later retitled \\"Specialist-4\\" and currently \\"Specialist\\"), which he described as being a \\"corporal without portfolio.\\" In 1960, Lehrer returned to full-time studies at Harvard, but in 1965 gave up on his mathematical dissertation about the subject of modes in statistics, after working on it intermittently for 15 years.  From 1962, he taught in the political science department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). In 1972, he joined the faculty of the University of California, Santa Cruz, teaching an introductory course entitled \\"The Nature of Mathematics\\" to liberal arts majors--\\"Math for Tenors\\", according to Lehrer. He also taught a class in musical theater. He occasionally performed songs in his lectures, primarily those relating to the topic.  In 2001, Lehrer taught his last mathematics class (on the topic of infinity) and retired from academia. He has remained in the area, and in 2003 said he still \\"hangs out\\" around the University of California, Santa Cruz. Question: Did Lehrer ever join the military?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, Tom Lehrer joined the military. He was drafted into the U.S. Army from 1955 to 1957 and worked at the National Security Agency (NSA) during that time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: Who calls Ken? Movie title: In Bruges Movie plot: Carrying out orders to execute a priest, rookie hitman Ray also accidentally kills a young boy. He and his mentor Ken are sent to Bruges, where they are to await further instructions, by their employer Harry. Ken finds the city charming and quaint, while Ray has nothing but contempt for it. One night, Ken indulges Ray's desire to get out of their hotel room, and they explore the city. They chance upon a film shoot involving a dwarf actor, which amuses Ray. Ray approaches ChloÃ«, a local drug dealer moonlighting as a production assistant. He takes her to a fancy restaurant, where he gets into an argument with a couple and ends up knocking them unconscious. ChloÃ« takes Ray to her apartment, but her ex-boyfriend Eirik suddenly appears and threatens Ray with a handgun. Ray disarms him, and fires the gun (which is loaded with blanks) in his face, blinding one of his eyes. ChloÃ« shamefully admits that she and Eirik occasionally rob tourists after she seduces them, insisting she'd told Eirik that Ray was not a target. Ray also becomes acquainted with the dwarf actor, Jimmy, who turns out to be a drug-abusing racist. Harry calls Ken and orders him to kill Ray, on the principle that the killing of a childâeven accidentallyâis unforgivable. With a handgun supplied by Harry's local contact Yuri, Ken tracks Ray to a park and reluctantly prepares to kill him. However, Ray, distraught at his killing of the boy, prepares to kill himself with Eirik's loaded gun. Seeing this, Ken stops Ray, informs him of Harry's order, and tells him to leave Bruges to make a new start elsewhere.

A. bus  B. la ville  C. web page  D. email  E. carrier pigeon  The best answer is A:","output":"The best answer is D. email. Email is a widely-used method for companies to directly communicate advertisements and promotions to consumers. While other options like bus (A), la ville (B, which means \\"the city\\" in French), web page (C), and carrier pigeon (E) do exist, they are not as direct or effective as email marketing. Bus advertisements and posting banners in the city, for example, can only reach people in a specific location and may not target the desired audience effectively. Web pages can display ads, but they require the user to visit that specific page first. Carrier pigeons might be an amusing and creative idea, but it is not practical nor widely used in modern advertising. Email allows companies to send targeted promotional messages, newsletters, and updates to a specific audience who have opted into receiving them. This helps ensure that the message reaches the right people, and they can be tailored to the consumers' needs and preferences.

Excitement: The use of all-caps words like \\"LOL\\" and \\"GOT\\" and multiple exclamation points suggests that the person writing the tweet is highly enthusiastic about the subject they're discussing.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Review: The films of UPA are surprisingly well rated on IMDb despite the fact that the animation quality is light-years behind that of Looney Toons, Disney and MGM at their prime. Sadly, due to rising costs in making pretty cartoons with high frame-rates and lovely backgrounds, the UPA style (which debuted about 1950) began to dominate in the late 50s and 60s. After all, the films were dirt cheap to make and they'd received several Oscars to \\"prove\\" that the cartoons were now mainstream. So as a result, lousy animation was becoming the norm and this trend wasn't reversed until the 1980s. This UPA film is one of the early ones. The characters are very simply drawn (any simpler and they would have used stick figures) and the backgrounds were ugly--simple line drawings with colors added in a very slap-dash manner (often with a sponge and rarely completely filling the items). As for the story, it's a jive story with a strong jazz style attitude. Some will love this, others will just find it very, very loud. It's the traditional \\"Frankie and Johnny\\" story and because of the shootings and all, it's probably not a great film for the kids. Heck, because of the animation and jazz, it's not a particularly good film for me, either! Some will read my review and no doubt think I am a crank (which I am, to a degree). However, I love animated films and a little of this minimalistic UPA style goes a very, very long way and you can't seriously consider them great works of art--just very, very quickly made cartoons.

Context: Despite the passport union with Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland, Finland could not join the Nordic Council until 1955 because of Soviet fears that Finland might become too close to the West. At that time the Soviet Union saw the Nordic Council as part of NATO of which Denmark, Norway and Iceland were members. That same year Finland joined the United Nations, though it had already been associated with a number of UN specialized organisations. The first Finnish ambassador to the UN was G.A. Gripenberg (1956–1959), followed by Ralph Enckell (1959–1965), Max Jakobson (1965–1972), Aarno Karhilo (1972–1977), Ilkka Pastinen (1977–1983), Keijo Korhonen (1983–1988), Klaus Törnudd (1988–1991), Wilhelm Breitenstein (1991–1998) and Marjatta Rasi (1998–2005). In 1972 Max Jakobson was a candidate for Secretary-General of the UN. In another remarkable event of 1955, the Soviet Union decided to return the Porkkala peninsula to Finland, which had been rented to the Soviet Union in 1948 for 50 years as a military base, a situation which somewhat endangered Finnish sovereignty and neutrality.

Article: If you have a dog, it is important not to call him to where you are. He will be expecting something positive when he comes to you, and may be very disappointed that you called him for something as unpleasant as a bath. It is preferable to either pick him up and carry him to the bathing spot (if he's small enough), or walk him there.  You can pick up your cat, but he may run and hide from you if he knows that you are about to give him a bath. Entice him out of his hiding spot with a treat. Do not be surprised if your pet becomes resistant once he realizes where he is going. If this happens, do not raise your voice. Be gentle yet firm with him, since bathing him will be necessary to remove the urine smell. Once you get to the bathing area, it may be helpful to give your pet a treat or two. If you are bathing your pet in the tub, place a towel in the tub before he gets in. Brushing your pet will remove any tangles or matted fur. Doing this before you bathe him is very important—trying to brush through tangles or mattes is next to impossible when your pet's coat is soaked with water. Start from your pet's neck and slowly work your way down to his tail. If your pet's nails have not been trimmed in a while, your pet could easily use his nails to scratch you while you are bathing him. If you are comfortable with doing so, trim your dog's or cat's nails. If you have to use styptic powder on any of the nails to stop bleeding, wait until the bleeding has stopped before bathing him. Keeping water out of your pet's eyes, ears, and face will be important when you are bathing him. If your pet will let you, place one or two cotton balls in each ear. If he doesn't like having cotton balls in his ears, use extra care to avoid getting water in his ears. Remember to take the cotton balls out of his ears when you have finished bathing him. If you are using a hose or handheld shower head to bathe your pet, make sure that the water pressure is not too forceful. You can also use a large plastic pitcher to pour water over him. If you are giving your pet a bath inside, make sure that the water is no hotter than lukewarm.  You may not be able to adjust the temperature of the water if you are bathing your pet outside. To get your pet comfortable with the sensation of getting wet, put the water on his back and shoulders first. Once he has relaxed, wet his neck and work your way back to his tail. Place a generous amount of shampoo in your palm and use your fingers to gently work the shampoo into your pet's coat and skin, starting from his neck and working your way back. By working back from his neck, you will prevent any fleas from moving up his body towards his face and head.  You will probably need to shampoo your pet more than once to get the urine smell out. Keep in mind that shampoo has the tendency to strip the skin and coat of natural oils, so you do not want to shampoo him too many times. Use a washcloth dampened with plain water (no shampoo- bold) to wash your pet's face.  Talking with your pet in calming voice and offering him occasional treats will help make the bathing process more enjoyable for him. Be careful not to get the shampoo in your pet's eyes. Shampoo residue can make your pet feel itchy, so you want to make sure that you rinse out all of the shampoo before drying him. If you are bathing your dog, be mindful that your his hair is thicker than your own, so you will need to take extra time to work your fingers through his hair when rinsing out the shampoo.  You will know when you have rinsed out all of the shampoo when you no longer see any suds in the water that you are using to rinse him. Consider giving your pet a quick sniff after you have finished rinsing him to see if you can smell urine. If you still smell urine, consider shampooing and rinsing him again. If you placed a piece of steel wool in the bathtub drain, remove and discard the steel wool after you have finished rinsing him off. If you are bathing your cat, wrap her snugly in a towel and dry her off in a warm, draft-free location in your home. You may need more than one towel to dry off your dog, depending on his size. If you know that your dog is going to want to shake as soon as you finish rinsing him off, you can try gently holding his muzzle with your thumb and forefinger—a dog cannot shake his body if you hold his muzzle still.  You can let go of his muzzle once he is at least somewhat dry. If you are using a blow dryer to dry your pet, set it on one of the cooler settings to prevent thermal damage to his skin.  Your dog may be tempted to bolt and rub on something (e.g., furniture, carpet, ground) as soon as you have finished drying him off. Consider keeping him in a relatively confined area, such as the kitchen, until he is completely dry. Reward your pet with a generous amount of positive reinforcement. This can be a combination of treats, new toys, verbal praise, and extra playtime. What is a summary?","output":"Summary: Bathing your pet can be a necessary task to remove unpleasant smells, such as urine. To make the experience better for both you and your pet, approach the bathing process gently and calmly. For dogs, walk or carry them to the bathing area, whereas, for cats, entice them out of hiding with a treat. Prepare the bathing area with a towel and ensure the water is lukewarm. Brush your pet before bathing and trim their nails to avoid scratches. Keep their eyes, ears, and face dry and use a gentle water pressure. Apply enough shampoo to remove the urine smell, and rinse thoroughly. Dry your pet well with towels or a blow dryer on a cooler setting and reward them with treats and positive reinforcement after the bath."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Later the woman is found dead near the border. Brogan returns to the grandparents to tell them the bad news. Taslima Jahangir, a 15-year-old girl from Bangladesh, presents a paper at school promoting that people should try to understand the 9/11 hijackers. The school principal reports this to authorities. FBI agents raid the home and ransack the girl's room, reading her diaries and a school assignment on the ethics of suicide; they criticize her room as \\"too austere\\" and note that she has an account on an Islamic website. The profiler says this makes her look like a would-be suicide bomber. Taslima is not charged for this, but it turns out that she stays in the United States illegally. She was born in Bangladesh and brought to the United States at age three. Taslima's continued presence jeopardizes her chances and puts at risk her two younger siblings, who are US citizens because they were born in the country.

After filling his pen, Allan looked at his paper in the orange glow from the lantern set back in the desk's right-hand corner. His pen cast a forbidding line of shadow slanting across the page, echoing the inky darkness crouching in the edges of the lantern's struggling glow. The only other illumination came from a lurid moonlight filtered through thin branches and clouds, casting its bone-pale glow onto the pine floorboards. Allan unfolded another page, this one crowded with ranks of letters in tight formation from left to right. The lines of letters stepped into their divisions, in the shape of a story's outline: the loose, dry skeleton of a tale lay exposed beneath their feet, awaiting tendons, muscle and blushing skin. Allan reviewed the troops, all prepared to disembark, their task to form the tale of a young man returning home from Life Abroad to find his childhood friend a bride to-be, thus upsetting the apple cart of his life's plan, clarified – of course – by his very time away from her he loved best.

Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: A new study done by the Higher Education Quality Council of Ontario (HEQCO) shows that it doesn't make much of a difference that parents reward their children with cash for their better marks. Many parents have offered cash to their children in the hope that it would improve marks and possibly raise their children's interest in achieving higher marks. The study, conducted by researchers from the University of Toronto (UT) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to learn more about the potential for financial encouragement as motivation for improved marks, involved first and second year students receiving financial aid in 2008-2009 at the University of Toronto Scarborough. The top students participating in the study who said they were \\"very concerned\\" about having enough money to complete their degrees were to receive 100 for getting a grade of 70 per cent for each one-semester course, plus 20 for every percentage point beyond that.It was imaginable that a student could earn as much as 700 for achieving 100 percent in a course. Harvey Weingarten, president and CEO of HEQCO said, \\"In its efforts to help disadvantaged students by exploring the idea of paying them to attend school, the Toronto District School Board (TDSB) is asking the same question many other districts are asking about how to improve student participation and performance.Our study and others to date indicate that has little effect if any in those situations where it has been tested.\\" The authors of the study suggest that ineffective study habits may be a barrier to academic achievement and that the real problem may be more a lack of academic preparation than a lack of effort or motivation.They note that the availability of peer   advising does not appear to have helped greatly.They conclude that other potential avenues to improving performance, or other approaches of teaching, are needed at the high school and postsecondary levels.

Write an article based on this summary: The Irish Top Gear producer punched by Jeremy Clarkson is suing the presenter and the BBC for racial discrimination.","output":"Title: Irish Top Gear Producer Sues Jeremy Clarkson and BBC for Racial Discrimination Introduction In a shocking turn of events, the Irish Top Gear producer, who was involved in a highly publicized altercation with Jeremy Clarkson, has decided to file a lawsuit against the former Top Gear presenter and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). The producer, Oisin Tymon, alleges that both Clarkson and the BBC are guilty of racial discrimination.  Background Back in March 2015, Jeremy Clarkson was involved in a physical and verbal altercation with Oisin Tymon, a Top Gear producer, at a hotel in North Yorkshire. According to reports at the time, Clarkson was upset because he could not get a hot meal after a long day of filming and took out his frustrations on Tymon. The argument resulted in Clarkson punching Tymon, leaving him with a split lip and a trip to the hospital. This incident proved to be the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back, as Clarkson's contract with the BBC was not renewed, effectively putting an end to his tenure with the popular motoring show. The Lawsuit In November 2015, Tymon filed a lawsuit against both Jeremy Clarkson and the BBC, claiming racial discrimination. At the heart of the lawsuit, Tymon alleges that Clarkson used derogatory and offensive language, specifically targeting his Irish nationality, during the heated altercation. Consequently, Tymon asserts that such comments constitute racial discrimination under the United Kingdom's law. Furthermore, Tymon's legal claim against the BBC revolves around the notion that the broadcasting corporation failed to protect him from racial discrimination. Employers in the United Kingdom are obliged to shield their workers from any form of discrimination and foster a safe and inclusive working environment. Tymon's legal team posits that the BBC did not fulfill this obligation. Impact on Clarkson and the BBC The lawsuit brought forth by Tymon has had significant implications for Jeremy Clarkson. Firstly, it is important that the case brings Clarkson's character into question, especially considering his departure from Top Gear and subsequent move to Amazon's motoring show, The Grand Tour. With a reputation marred by controversy, it remains to be seen if the lawsuit will have further consequences on his career. The BBC, on the other hand, has been heavily criticized for the handling of the whole fiasco. While the corporation did not renew Clarkson's contract, it has been accused of not taking adequate measures to address the issue of discrimination in the workplace. The lawsuit sheds light on a potential systemic issue within the BBC, which has faced other allegations of discrimination in the past. Possible Outcomes Depending on the outcome of the lawsuit, both Jeremy Clarkson and the BBC could face significant financial reparations to Tymon if they are found guilty of racial discrimination. Furthermore, the incident could have lasting effects on both parties' reputations and their ability to approach similar situations in the future. It also highlights the importance of addressing racial discrimination in all areas of life, including the entertainment industry. Conclusion The lawsuit filed by the Irish Top Gear producer, Oisin Tymon, against Jeremy Clarkson and the BBC for racial discrimination is a stark reminder that such issues should not be taken lightly. Moreover, it presents an opportunity for the entertainment industry and companies, in general, to reassess and strengthen their policies against discrimination in the workplace. The outcome of this case could have considerable consequences for both Clarkson and the BBC and may serve as a precedent for taking racial discrimination seriously within the industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Science fiction films that reflect quality are scarce indeed, largely because transposal of imaginative themes from the genre to the screen too often falls short of effective execution as a result of insufficient funding or inadequate invention, and unfortunately for its producers, this work is lacking on both counts, woefully so in the case of the latter. With essentially no budget with which to operate, it is a grave mistake to attempt the depiction of such a gamut of events as those within this scenario and, in particular, special effects of space opera warfare which appear only clownish, while seeds from the scriptors' imagination lie fallow due to some of the most fatuous misunderstanding of basic scientific principles to be found. Among these are frequent firing of weapons within a sealed environment, and a wayward law of gravity which enables freedom of movement of cast members while inanimate objects float weightlessly, but it is easier to accept these than it is to pretend that any of the episodes have a basis in plausibility. The plot involves an escape of life sentenced prisoners from a space station penal colony to a waste landfill upon our moon and their various attempts to obtain passage back to Earth, with some few capable players present who are execrably directed by first-timer Paolo Mazzucato, whose production team wastes effort upon such as holographic pornography while ignoring a pressing and basic requirement for the creation of states of suspense and of impetus.

Her first album, I Dreamed a Dream, was released in November 2009 and became the UK's best-selling debut album of all time, beating the previous record held by Spirit by Leona Lewis. I Dreamed a Dream set a record for biggest first week sales by a debut album, according to the Official Chart Company in the United Kingdom. Boyle took singing lessons from vocal coach Fred O'Neil. She attended Edinburgh Acting School and took part in the Edinburgh Fringe. She also long participated in her parish church's pilgrimages to the Knock Shrine, County Mayo, Ireland, and sang there at the Marian basilica.  In 1995, she auditioned for Michael Barrymore's My Kind of People.  In 1999, Boyle submitted a track for a charity CD to commemorate the Millennium produced at a West Lothian school. Only 1,000 copies of the CD, Music for a Millennium Celebration, Sounds of West Lothian, were pressed. An early review by Amber McNaught in the West Lothian Herald & Post said Boyle's rendition of \\"Cry Me a River\\" was \\"heartbreaking\\" and \\"had been on repeat in my CD player ever since I got this CD...\\" The recording found its way onto the internet following her first televised appearance and the New York Post said it showed that Boyle was \\"not a one-trick pony.\\" Hello! said the recording \\"cement[ed] her status\\" as a singing star.  In 1998, Boyle recorded three tracks--\\"Cry Me A River\\", \\"Killing Me Softly\\", and \\"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\\"--at Heartbeat Studio, Midlothian. She used all her savings to pay for a professionally cut demo, copies of which she later sent to record companies, radio talent competitions, local and national TV. The demo consisted of her versions of \\"Cry Me a River\\" and \\"Killing Me Softly with His Song\\"; the songs were uploaded to the Internet after her BGT audition.  After Boyle won several local singing competitions, her mother urged her to enter Britain's Got Talent and take the risk of singing in front of an audience larger than her parish church. Former coach O'Neil said Boyle abandoned an audition for The X Factor because she believed people were being chosen for their looks. She almost abandoned her plan to enter Britain's Got Talent believing she was too old, but O'Neil persuaded her to audition nevertheless. Boyle said that she was motivated to seek a musical career to pay tribute to her mother. Her performance on the show was the first time she had sung in public since her mother died.

This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels. On the other other hand, radioactive elements are nonrenewable like fossil fuels and could eventually be used up.  and the situation: Two competing countries used different energy sources to produce their electricity. Turkey used mostly fossil fuels, while Greece used nuclear power.  Answer the following question: Which country caused less acid rain? The answer is:","output":"Greece caused less acid rain because it relied on nuclear power to produce its electricity. Acid rain is primarily a result of the emission of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) into the atmosphere. These emissions mainly come from burning fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. When SO2 and NOx react with other substances in the atmosphere, they form acidic compounds that fall to the ground as precipitation, causing acid rain. In the given situation, Turkey primarily used fossil fuels to produce electricity. This means that their power generation process released significant amounts of SO2 and NOx into the atmosphere, contributing to acid rain formation. In contrast, Greece relied on nuclear power, which produces electricity without emitting SO2 and NOx, leading to a drastically lower contribution to acid rain. Though nuclear power is not without its drawbacks, such as the generation of radioactive waste and the risk of nuclear accidents, it does provide an advantage in terms of reduced air pollution and acid rain when compared to fossil fuel-based electricity production. Therefore, Greece, with its reliance on nuclear energy, is the country that caused less acid rain in this scenario."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer this question: where did hurricane irma hit in the us?","output":"Hurricane Irma, one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record, wreaked havoc across several parts of the United States in 2017. It exhibited maximum sustained winds of up to 185 mph and continued for a record-breaking 37 hours. Irma's destructive path in the U.S. can be traced to several key regions that were severely impacted by the hurricane. Florida: The state of Florida bore the brunt of Hurricane Irma within the United States. The cyclone made its initial landfall on September 10, 2017, as a Category 4 storm in the Florida Keys at Cudjoe Key. The hurricane then moved towards the northwest and made a second landfall on Marco Island, which lies west of the Florida Peninsula. The hurricane proceeded to move northwards, leading to widespread damage throughout the state. Irma's impact was felt across Florida, affecting major cities like Miami, Tampa, Jacksonville, Orlando, and the surrounding areas. Streets, homes, and businesses were flooded; utility infrastructures were damaged, rendering millions without power, and the storm caused incredible damage to agriculture, marinas, and the natural environment. Georgia: Hurricane Irma impacted the neighboring state of Georgia as well, mostly as a tropical storm after being downgraded from a hurricane. As it moved northwards, Irma's strong winds and rain lashed the state, leading to coastal flooding, property damage, and power outages. The areas impacted in Georgia included the coastal cities of Savannah and Brunswick, as well as the regions of Atlanta and South Georgia. Hundreds of thousands of residents lost power, and there were reports of downed trees, damaged homes, and localized flooding. South Carolina: Moving further north, Hurricane Irma's impact was also felt in South Carolina. While not as severe as in Florida or Georgia, coastal areas and the state's Lowcountry region experienced storm surge-induced flooding, and strong winds led to downed trees, property damage, and power outages. Charleston was notably affected, with knee-high flooding reported in some parts of the city. U.S. Territories in the Caribbean: Before reaching the U.S. mainland, Hurricane Irma had already left a trail of destruction in U.S. territories in the Caribbean. The U.S. Virgin Islands, particularly St. Thomas and St. John, were heavily impacted, experiencing widespread devastation to infrastructure and homes. In Puerto Rico, while the eye of the hurricane did not directly pass over the island, it experienced significant rainfall, flooding, and wind damage. As a result, many structures were damaged, and hundreds of thousands of residents were left without power. In conclusion, Hurricane Irma left a massive trail of destruction across the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and the U.S. Caribbean territories. Along its path, millions of lives were disrupted, and the financial, social, and environmental toll from the storm was immense. It will be remembered as one of the most powerful and damaging storms in U.S. history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The play's creators said voices had been \\"silenced\\", but the NYT said the play failed to meet standards.

A modern-day love story of a man seeing the girl of his dreams across a New York subway train and tracking her down over the Internet has failed to have a fairytale ending with the relationship over.  For Web designer Patrick Moberg, then 21, from Brooklyn, it was love at first sight when he saw a woman on a Manthttan train last November. But he lost her in the crowd so he set up a website with a sketch picture to find her--www.Nygirlofmydreams.com.  Unbelievably in a city of 8 million people, it only took Moberg 48 hours to find the woman, with his phone ringing non-stop and email box overflowing. New Yorkers took pity on the subway Romeo and joined his hunt.  The mysterious girl was named as Camille Hayton, from Melbourne, Australia, who was working at the magazine Black Book and also lived in Brooklyn. One of her friends saw the sketched picture on the Web site and recognized her.  But after finding each other, appearing on TV and getting international press, the couple took their romance out of the public eye, with Moberg closing down the Web site and with both refusing to make any more comments--until now.  Hayton told Australian newspaper The Sunday Telegraph that she dated Moberg for about two months but it just didn't work out.  \\"I say we dated for a while but now we're just friends,\\" Hayton, now 23, told the newspaper. Hayton said she is still recognized about three times a week on the streets of Manhattan as \\"that girl\\" and the question is always the same: \\"So what happened?\\"  \\"I think the situation was so intense that it linked us,\\" she said, adding, \\"it linked us in a way that you could mistake, I guess, for being more romantic than it was. I don't know. But I wanted to give it a go so didn't wonder what if, what if?\\"  Hayton told The Sunday Telegraph that she is enjoying single life in New York, keeping busy with acting classes, working in two clothing stores. Last week she had a small role as a waitress in the long-running daytime soap As the World Turns.  \\"I just can't believe it happened. It feels like a long time ago,\\" said Hayton.

When \\"Girlfight\\" came out, the reviews praised it, but I didn't get around to seeing it. I finally saw it when it got released on video, and understand the glowing reviews. The movie opens in a high school in the middle of a ghetto. We quickly get introduced to student Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez). She has a bad-ass expression on her face, and any idea about Diana that we might derive from this expression soon gets corroborated when she gets in a fight. As Diana gets in trouble for this, we then meet her father, an aggressive type in his own right; clearly we can't totally blame Diana for her attitude. But then the movie really picks up, as a new thought germinates in Diana's mind: boxing as a way to escape this grim existence. Her older brother has already gotten into boxing, but her father most likely won't approve. Only Diana herself can decide what to do. Just the first few minutes alone identified that I was in for a very gritty, non-Hollywood movie, but the brief appearance of John Sayles in a supporting role truly affirmed that. Even before they get to any boxing scenes, you feel like you're getting pounded in the face at seeing the ugly life that Diana lives. And when they finally arrive at the film's main story, there's no turning back. All in all, I definitely recommend this movie. I will admit that using boxing as a means to show someone trying to make something of himself/herself has been sort of a cliché in cinema for many years (\\"Rocky\\", \\"Million Dollar Baby\\"), but I still think that they did a great job with it here. In fact, this may have brought the genre to its apex. Really good. Too bad that Michelle Rodriguez wasted herself in Hollywood movies after this one. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"This review thought positively of the movie \\"Girlfight.\\" The reviewer recommends the movie, praises its gritty, non-Hollywood style, and appreciates the performances and storyline.

Title: great trike! Review: After much searching, we finally found a nice trike for our 2 year old. This bike is sturdily built, relatively easy to assmeble (took my mechanically-inclined husband about 30 minutes to assemble), and has lots of great features.It does appear to be for smaller children. Our son just turned 2, is the size of a 3 year old, and this bike will likely only fit him for 1 year. I wouldn't buy this for an older child (like a 4 year old) unless they are small.The frame adjusts to 4 different sizes, as does the seat. The handle telescopes to 3 different lengths. The push bar isn't quite tall enough to suit us, but we are tall people & for a stroll around the neighborhood, it's comfortable enough.You can lock the steering and the rear wheels (nice for walking the long straight-aways) or you can unlock the rear wheels and the adult controls the steering.This little bike is cute, well built, (it's a Kettler!) and quite reasonable in price. We recommend it highly. Answer: A:","output":"Yes"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Please answer the following question: A prospective client sent me a link to this in-depth article on IBM's design thinking revolution, where Phil Gilbert, IBM's General Manager of Design, has hired over 1000 designers into the firm, and pushed for over 8000 of its managers and staff to get 'trained' in design thinking. They have even created specific design centres across the firm, with design offices in most of its key locations, such as the one above. The goal is nothing short of beginning IBM's next phase of transformation, one of many in its 100+ year history. However, all is not rosy. Despite achieving a monumental success relative to the status quo, 8000 'recognised' design thinkers in a corporation of over 370,000 souls is barely a dent in terms of changing practice. If NoTosh were to effect change in only 2% of the teachers with whom we work, we'd have packed up our bags long ago. I'm not sure hiring 1000 designers in and of itself is the answer to any organisation trying to instil a different way of viewing the world. Here's why. Since design thinking really began to be a thing, back in the early 60s, the designer him or herself has consistently been at the centre of the design process. Even though we talk of 'user-centred design', the actual ideation and production of a solution, and in many cases the synthesis and definition of the problem to be solve, too, are all tasks undertaken by skilled 'designers', rather than the people in the organisation who have the scope, brand, or 'permission' to play in that space. Once the designers leave the project, so does the design thinking. There is a reason d.school sees its executive courses filled with repeat customers and firms like IDEO continue to thrive - they are resolving challenges in specific examples of services or products, but not necessarily transforming the firms and organisations who had the budget and desire to solve a problem in that specific area. Solving a problem costs money. Solving a problem and teaching the client how to do it again and again costs more than just money.... Why did IMB hire so many designers?  A. to grow the company  B. to help push a design think revolution  C. to establish more offices across the firm  D. not enough information Answer:","output":"B. to help push a design thinking revolution"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - make music - inspiration - musical sounds - making music - dancing  Explain why a human would choose \\"inspiration\\" to answer the question above:","output":"Inspiration is a crucial element not only in playing piano but in any creative activities. The option \\"inspiration\\" could be selected as the answer for numerous reasons. Firstly, it's important to understand that playing the piano goes beyond just the physical aspect of hitting the right keys and creating sounds or music. It necessitates the capacity for creative expression, which can only come from a source—this source is often referred to as inspiration. Inspiration aids in the process of interpreting the emotion and intention behind the pieces, and influences how the pianist makes the piece their own instead of just recreating the sounds or imitating someone else's interpretation. Furthermore, inspiration leads to the creation of original music. A pianist cannot make music without that initial spark that contributes to the creativity process or the ability to put together notes and rhythms into a meaningful composition. This is true not only for piano players but for all musicians and artists.  For instance, let's take the example of the great composers in history. Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, and many others each had their unique source and type of inspiration—one that fueled and enhanced their creativity, empowering them to write timeless masterpieces that endure till today. This shows how inspiration is a fundamental aspect when it comes to the creation of music. Moreover, creativity is not limited to the physical actions like \\"making music\\" or \\"dancing\\". Inspiration serves as a starting point, ignites imagination, is a motivator and is also important for personal growth and developing artistic skills. It is often seen as the heart of any creative endeavor. It allows artists to imagine, explore, and experiment with new ideas, sounds, or movements—leading to innovation and growth in their craft. Making music and dancing are part of the process, but they rely heavily on inspiration to fuel and guide the process. While musical sounds are the outcome of playing the piano, they could be considered as a mechanical output if devoid of inspiration or emotion. The same applies to dancing—it is the physical realization of an inspirational idea. Hence, a human might choose \\"inspiration\\" as the best response because it encapsulates a core necessity that is integral to playing the piano and any other creative activity. Inspiration is the catalyst that not only launches but also enhances the artistic and creative process, creating a further rippling effect that influences the artist's work, touching the hearts and minds of those who experience it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

After finishing with his latest conquest (Sarah Henderson), Telly bums around town with his friend Casper (Justin Pierce) looking for some kind of distraction .One of Telly's former sex partners, Jennie (Chloë Sevigny), and her friend Ruby (Rosario Dawson) receive mixed news at a public health clinic. The promiscuous Ruby is clean, but Jennie (who has only had sex once, with Telly) is HIV positive. The news devastates Jennie, who will spend much of the film searching for the wandering Telly.Telly & Casper have several adventures: buying weed in the park, shoplifting a \\"40\\" of malt liquor from a Korean Guy (Johnathan Staci Kim) of whom they make fun of, beating up a man who \\"disses\\" them, and finally winding up at a teen party that night.

When the reactant particles are heated, they move faster and faster. This results in a greater frequency of collisions. A more important effect of the temperature increase is that the collisions occur with a greater force and are thus more likely to surmount the activation energy barrier and go on to form products. Increasing the temperature of a reaction increases the number of effective collisions between reacting particles, so the reaction rate increases.

For the third week in a row, the 30-year fixed-rate average did not budge, holding steady at 4.1 percent with an average 0.5 point. It was 4.57 percent a year ago. Since late June, the 30-year fixed rate hasn’t been above 4.14 percent or below 4.1 percent. The 15-year fixed-rate average edged down to 3.24 percent with an average 0.5 point. It was 3.25 percent a week ago and 3.59 percent a year ago. The 15-year fixed rate has drifted between 3.27 percent and 3.22 percent since late June. Hybrid adjustable rate mortgages also were flat. The five-year ARM average was unchanged at 2.97 percent with an average 0.5 point. It was 3.28 percent a year ago. The one-year ARM average inched up to 2.4 percent with an average 0.4 point. It was 2.39 percent a week ago. “Mortgage rates were little changed amid a week of light economic reports,” Frank E. Nothaft, Freddie Mac vice president and chief economist, said in a statement. “Of the few releases, the ISM’s manufacturing index rose to 59 in August from 57.1 the previous month. This was the highest reading of the index since March 2011.” Meanwhile, mortgage applications were flat last week, according to the latest data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. The market composite index, a measure of total loan application volume, barely moved, growing 0.2 percent. The refinance index increased 1 percent, while the purchase index fell 2 percent. The refinance share of mortgage activity accounted for 57 percent of all applications, its highest level since March. It also became more difficult to obtain a mortgage in August, according to the MBA. Mortgage credit availability index, a measure that looks at how available mortgage credit is at a point in time, declined 0.3 percentage points to 116.1 last month. A decline in the MCAI indicates that lending standards are tightening. MCAI is calculated using several factors related to borrower eligibility – credit score, loan type, loan-to-value ratio – reported by 85 lenders or investors. “While overall access to credit tightened in August, we did see some loosening in certain segments of the purchase market,” Michael Fratantoni, MBA’s chief economist, said in a statement. “In particular, lenders instituted additional offerings of loan programs like the FHA 203(k) home improvement program and one-time-close programs for financing new construction.” Write a title for it.","output":"Mortgage Rates Stay Steady, and Home Loans Become a Little Harder to Get"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He has just been awakened by his housekeeper, Urania (Helene Gerasimidou). \\"This is the last day\\" she says, \\"Let me come with you to the hospital.\\" Alexander, very philosophically, refuses and he thanks her for her three years of faithful service. She leaves the room, but promptly returns for an ultimate glance at Alexander, on the pretext of reminding him that his dog has eaten, before furtively leaving again. Alexander, now alone, finishes his cup of coffee. The camera moves to show the balcony, where the dog is lying down, and the sea panorama. Alexander turns on his record player which plays the film's theme for a moment. He turns it off, and looking through the window toward the harbor and then toward the adjacent building, he hears an echo of the same music coming from one of the apartments. Alexander says it happens every morning, and he wonders aloud who it might be and why.Alexander takes his dog for a walk along the harbor.

This is because egg whites beaten to stiff peaks give the cake structure and a light texture, which is ideal for creating a Twinkie-like cake. Step 2: Gather the ingredients and equipment You'll need: - Pound cake mix - Water (as specified on the cake mix package) - Egg whites (as specified on the cake mix package) - A large bowl - An electric mixer or a whisk  Step 3: Mix the cake batter In a large bowl, add water to the cake mix as specified on the package and mix thoroughly using an electric mixer or a whisk. Step 4: Beat the egg whites Using a clean bowl and whisk or electric mixer with clean beaters, beat the egg whites until they form stiff peaks. Stiff peaks are formed when the peaks hold their shape and don't fall back into the mixture when the whisk is lifted out. Step 5: Fold the egg whites into the cake batter Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the cake batter. This will give the pound cake a lighter texture that is more similar to a Twinkie.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: How many crew members from the ship that was crushed in January 1914 were eventually rescued? ?  The last voyage of the Karluk, flagship of the Canadian Arctic Expedition of 1913–16, ended with the loss of the ship in the Arctic seas,  and the subsequent deaths of nearly half her complement of 25. In August 1913, Karluk, a brigantine formerly used as a whaler, became trapped in the  ice while sailing to a rendezvous point at Herschel Island. After a long drift across the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, in January 1914 the ship was crushed and sunk. In the ensuing months, the crew and expedition staff struggled to survive, first on the ice and later on the shores of Wrangel Island. In all, eleven men died before rescue. The Canadian Arctic Expedition was organised under the leadership of Canadian anthropologist Vilhjalmur Stefansson, and had both scientific and geographic purposes. Shortly after Karluk was trapped, Stefansson and a small party left the ship, stating that they intended to hunt for caribou. However, the ice carried Karluk westwards, far from the hunting party who found it impossible  to return to the ship. Stefansson reached land and then devoted himself to the expedition's scientific objectives, leaving the crew and staff on board the ship under the charge of its captain, Robert Bartlett. After the sinking, Bartlett organised a march across the ice to Wrangel Island, 80 miles (130 km) away. Conditions   were difficult and dangerous; two four-man parties were lost before the island was reached. From the island, Bartlett and an Inuk companion set out across the frozen sea for the Siberian coast, in search of help. Assisted by local populations, the pair eventually reached Alaska, but sea ice conditions prevented any immediate rescue mission. On Wrangel Island, the stranded party survived by hunting game, but were short of food and troubled by internal dissent. Before their eventual rescue in September 1914, three more of the party had died, two of illness and one in violent circumstances; 14 were rescued. Historians have divided views on Stefansson's decision to leave the ship. Some of the...

U.S. presidents, both Republican and Democrat, have long argued they have legal authority to order airstrikes and other short-term military campaigns if those engagements fall short of the \\"hostilities\\" mentioned in the War Powers Resolution.

News article: It's 2016: Time for cargo shorts to give up and die The American cargo short is in crisis — and relief doesn't seem to be coming anytime soon. If you've been paying attention to the news this week, you might have noticed a few clickbait stories about a little presidential election and some YMCA summer camp games taking place in Brazil. But beneath all the listicles and the GIFs, a violent skirmish is taking root about one of the greatest social justice issues of our time: the demise of the American cargo short. The nation stands on the precipice of civil war: some want to make cargo shorts \\"great again,\\" while others can't remember when cargo shorts ever were good. And though it can be frightening to take a stand on such a polarizing issue, I feel compelled, dear reader, to make my lonely little voice heard amidst all the screams. The cargo short is sick. The cargo short is violent. The cargo short must die, and it must die today (if not today, tomorrow's totally cool too). As a New Yorker, I know I'm not alone in being biased against cargo shorts and the people who wear them. In the city, cargo shorts are unconsciously banned — and those who do wear them are immediately labeled other/outsider/Midwestern tourist. Only someone who came from Oklahoma, the land of diner booths and wide open parking spaces, could feel so entitled to wear something so loose, so basic, so . . . comfortable. It can be easy, delightful even, to build a profile of the cargo-shorts wearer: the man who chooses Journey on the jukebox, steak tips on the Chili menu, 'Blue Man Group' on the TKTS line. He loves Sirius comedy and hates politicians. Is a big fan of Windows 8. Athletic socks? You bet he's got 'em. Every size and every color of the beautiful white rainbow. He's basic without boundaries, without shame, without spite. And of course, it's unfair to judge people solely on the basis of their terrible, terrible shorts. Blame the short, not the shorts-wearer. See the person beyond the wrench-ready pockets. Perhaps people like me are just jealous of the Cargo Man: entitled to wear something so openly basic, he possesses a liberty that I and other small-pocket folks can only dream of. The right to store fat wallets. The ability to hide his keys. The freedom to take a dump in his pants — and have absolutely no one notice. Blame the short, not the shorts-wearer. See the person beyond the pockets. But just because it's wrong and definitely elitist to criticize the cargo shorts wearer doesn't mean we can't hold cargo shorts accountable for the devastating impact they've had on American life and our cultural imagination. The cargo short, by the very laxness of its construction, lowers our sartorial and behavioral standards while giving us nothing in return. The sag built by choice into the seat of the pant screams: \\"It doesn't matter,\\" \\"Why bother?\\" \\"Can we just have sex in the morning?\\" Excessive pockets are made for excessive consumption. The more you can purchase, the more you can pocket, the greater your material and spiritual worth. You aren't what you eat or what you sow but what you can store near your balls. Excessive pockets are made for excessive consumption Let's not forget where most cargo shorts cut off — right at the knee. Cargo shorts are a part of a long tradition of clothes that shame the inner thigh. In most modern short and skortwear, shorts cut off far above the knee, a place where thighs and stretchmarks can finally peek out and be free. But prurient cargo pants seal one of the sexiest parts of the human body under an amorphous pile of poly-cotton. That's not a problem for most men, but for women — it comes at a tremendous cost. While some women do wear cargo shorts, they often do so at great danger. Head to your nearest Old Navy or Gap and you'll find nothing but line after line of mini-shorts with minipockets that can't hold anything larger than a minigolf pencil. Sure, sometimes women cross the aisle and buy men's cargo pants. And sometimes they are able to find their own in the Women's section of the store. Cargo shorts are fine as long as you're wearing them to Warped Tour — Bobby Big Wheel (@BobbyBigWheel) August 5, 2016 But more often than not, those cargo shorts don't fit right, don't look right, and cost far more than they're worth. Feminism isn't about equality of opportunity; it's about creating better opportunities in the first place. It's not about sharing the cargo wealth, but eliminating the item in the first place. The evidence is in the data. Sales are down. Viral think pieces are up. So many people have complained about their partners use of cargo shorts that, researchers recently found, it has heightened marital dissatisfaction. It can be painful to give up the cargo short collective fantasy we all once shared. The idea that we all looked good in these shorts, should buy these shorts. And while some politicians and writers want you to \\"make cargo shorts great again,\\" remember this: they were never good in the first place. We can build a better world, a world full of tasteful pockets and reasonable seams, zippers that always zip and shorts that cut off just right. Together, we can do this. It just starts with saying goodbye.

Q:What is the final step of the following process: -  A mine is excavated in the side of a mountain - Miners enter the mine - Miners remove the coal from the mine - The coal is placed into carts or on a conveyor belt - The coal is moved up to the surface - The coal is loaded onto a truck A:","output":"The final step of the process after the coal is loaded onto a truck is transporting the coal from the mining site to its destination. This step involves the careful and efficient movement of the coal to power plants, industrial sites, or other locations where the coal will be utilized as a fuel source or for other purposes. It is essential that the coal is handled and transported in a safe and environmentally responsible manner to minimize any potential hazards or negative impacts on the environment. Once the coal is loaded onto the truck, it will typically be taken to a nearby processing facility or directly to the end-user. At the processing facility, the coal may undergo various stages of cleaning, sorting, and grading to remove impurities and ensure that it meets the specific quality standards required by the customer. This process might involve washing, crushing, and other treatments to prepare the coal for its final use. During the transportation process, it is critical that safety and regulatory guidelines are followed to prevent accidents and protect the environment. This may involve securing the coal load properly, adhering to weight restrictions for vehicles, and following designated routes specified by transportation authorities. Drivers who specialize in transporting hazardous materials may be required to obtain proper licenses and certifications to handle and transport the coal legally. In some cases, coal may be transported by other means, such as railways or shipping routes. The decision to use specific transportation methods depends on factors such as distance, cost, and the availability of suitable infrastructure. For instance, a mine located near a port might prefer to export its coal using ships, while a mine in a landlocked region might rely on rail or road transport. Upon arrival at the destination, the coal is unloaded from the truck and either goes through the final stages of processing or is stored temporarily until it is ready to be used. The coal is typically stored in facilities designed to minimize the risk of fire and ensuring the coal remains dry and uncontaminated. Adequate ventilation and monitoring systems are also essential to prevent the accumulation of gases, such as methane, which can pose a significant safety hazard. To summarize, the final step in the coal mining process after the coal is loaded onto a truck involves safely and efficiently transporting the coal from the mine to its destination. This transportation step is critical to ensure the coal reaches the end-user in a timely manner, adhering to safety and environmental regulations. Once the coal arrives at its destination, it either undergoes further processing or is stored until it is ready to be utilized."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Would you eat a ready meal from the fridge rather than cook by yourself? Have you been doing Internet shopping rather than going to the stores? What can't you be bothered to do? A study into how lazy British people are has found more than half of the adults are so idle   that they'd catch the lift rather than climb two flights of stairs. Just over 2,000 people were quizzed by independent researchers at Nuffield Health, Britain's largest health center. The results were extremely surprising. About one in six people questioned said if their remote control was broken, they would continue watching the same channel rather than get up. More than one third of those questioned said they would not run to catch a bus. Worryingly, of the 654 respondents with children, 64% said they were often too tired to play with them. This led the report to conclude that it's no wonder that one in six children in the UK are classified as obese (very fat) before they start school. Dr Sarah Dauncey, medical director of Nuffield Health, said, \\"People need to get fitter, not just for their own sake, but for the sake of their families, friends and evidently (;) their pets too.\\" \\"If we don't start to take control of this problem, a whole generation will become too unfit to perform even the most fundamental tasks.\\" And Scotland's largest city, Glasgow, was shamed as the most idle city in the UK, with 75% questioned admitting they do not get enough exercise, followed closely by Birmingham and Southampton, both with 67%. The results bring serious challenges for the National Health Service, where obesity-related illnesses such as heart disease and cancer have been on a steady increase for the past 40 years and are costing billions of pounds every year.

William Henry Beveridge, 1st Baron Beveridge, KCB (5 March 1879 - 16 March 1963) was a British economist who was a noted progressive and social reformer. He is best known for his 1942 report Social Insurance and Allied Services (known as the Beveridge Report) which served as the basis for the post-World War II welfare state put in place by the Labour government elected in 1945. He was considered an authority on unemployment insurance from early in his career, served under Winston Churchill on the Board of Trade as Director of the newly created labour exchanges and later as Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Food. He was Director of the London School of Economics and Political Science from 1919 until 1937, when he was elected Master of University College, Oxford. After leaving university, Beveridge initially became a lawyer. He became interested in the social services and wrote about the subject for the Morning Post newspaper. His interest in the causes of unemployment began in 1903 when he worked at Toynbee Hall, a settlement house in London. There he worked closely with Sidney Webb and Beatrice Webb and was influenced by their theories of social reform, becoming active in promoting old age pensions, free school meals, and campaigning for a national system of labour exchanges.  In 1908, now considered to be the United Kingdom's leading authority on unemployment insurance, he was introduced by Beatrice Webb to Winston Churchill, who had recently been promoted to the Cabinet as President of the Board of Trade. Churchill invited Beveridge to join the Board of Trade, and he organised the implementation of the national system of labour exchanges and National Insurance to combat unemployment and poverty. During the First World War he was involved in mobilising and controlling manpower. After the war, he was knighted and made permanent secretary to the Ministry of Food.  In 1919 he left the civil service to become director of the London School of Economics and Political Science. Over the next few years he served on several commissions and committees on social policy. He was so highly influenced by the Fabian Society socialists - in particular by Beatrice Webb, with whom he worked on the 1909 Poor Laws report - that he could readily be considered one of their number. He published academic economic works including his early work on unemployment (1909) and a large historical study of prices and wages (1939). The Fabians made him a director of the LSE in 1919, a post he retained until 1937. During his time as Director, he jousted with Edwin Cannan and Lionel Robbins, who were trying to steer the LSE away from its Fabian roots.  In 1933 he helped set up the Academic Assistance Council. This helped prominent academics who had been dismissed from their posts on grounds of race, religion or political position to escape Nazi persecution. In 1937, Beveridge was appointed Master of University College, Oxford.","output":"This text is about William Henry Beveridge, 1st Baron Beveridge, a British economist, progressive, and social reformer.

Each of his three trials were before Judge Nelson Biederman III, who habitually imposed resentfully tough sentences. After being released from his third sentence, John decides to take revenge on Biederman. John tries to determine when Biederman will be presiding over his next case, only to discover that Biederman died three days before John's release. He turns his attention to the judge's brash son, Nelson Biederman IV (Will Arnett). At a dedication ceremony for Nelson III, John breaks into Nelson's BMW, wrecks the interior of it and empties Nelson's emergency inhaler. After the ceremony, Nelson drives off and, finding his inhaler empty, panics and hyperventilates. He stops at a pharmacy and frantically searches through the shelves, desperately seeking a replacement for the empty inhaler, which he finds and immediately opens to use. The pharmacy owners think he's a junkie seeking a fix. One owner mistakes the inhaler for a tiny pistol and calls the police. Nelson is arrested and charged with assault and armed robbery. He demands that the Biederman Foundation do everything possible to have him acquitted. The board nearly complies with Nelson's demands, but, as they are fed up of him and his behaviour, they see an opportunity to be rid of him. They get him a terrible defense lawyer for the trial. Nelson is found guilty and sentenced to three to five years. John, not satisfied with Nelson merely going to prison, decides to join him in prison by committing a crime. At his trial before the same judge Nelson had, John pleads guilty and asks for the same sentence (3â5 years) at the same prison that Nelson is in. He manages to become Nelsonâs cellmate, pretends to be his friend, and gives Nelson wrong advice on surviving life in prison.

The mechanical advantage is the factor by which a machine changes the input force. The ideal mechanical advantage is the increase or decrease in force that would occur if there were no friction to overcome in the use of the machine. Because all machines must overcome some friction, the ideal mechanical advantage is always somewhat greater than the actual mechanical advantage of the machine as it is used in the real world.  Paragraph: John designed a hypothetical lever that would have ideal mechanical advantage. He labeled the lever as lever A. He then wanted to compare this lever with a real world lever, which he labeled as lever B. He intended to use these levers to increase force.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which lever would produce smaller increase in force, lever A or lever B?","output":"Based on the information provided, lever A has an ideal mechanical advantage, meaning it has no friction to overcome. On the other hand, lever B is a real-world lever that does have to overcome some friction. Therefore, lever A would produce a larger increase in force since it does not have to deal with friction. In contrast, lever B would produce a smaller increase in force as it needs to overcome friction. So, the correct answer is lever B would produce a smaller increase in force."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey) is an Animal Control Officer and married to Agatha (Virginia Madsen); they have a son, Robin (Logan Lerman). At a bookstore, Agatha begins looking at a book titled The Number 23 written by Topsy Kretts. She later gives Walter the book as a birthday present. Walter starts reading the book, noticing odd similarities between himself and the main character, a detective who refers to himself as \\"Fingerling\\". Walter begins to have dreams of murdering Agatha. Walter tries to warn her about the number being dangerous and how it was going to come after her. She tells him he is crazy. Walter comes to realize that he is Topsy Kretts, having written the book as a way to rid himself of the guilt he felt over murdering a woman named Laura Tollins (Rhona Mitra). He was never suspected of the crime, and a man named Kyle Flinch (Mark Pellegrino) was convicted and imprisoned instead. Fearing he will hurt his family, he leaves home and moves to a hotel. Agatha finds Walter at the hotel and tries to assure him that he is no longer the person he was when he wrote the book. He insists that he is a killer, accepting the fact that he murdered Tollins, and tells Agatha to leave before he kills her, too. Agatha pushes a letter opener into Walter's hand, saying that, if he is indeed a killer, he can easily kill again and dares him to kill her. She tells him that she loves him. Walter tells her that she can't love him because no one can, mirroring an accusation made by Laura on the night of her murder.

If \\"A gentleman walking in the street.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A gentleman is on his way to a store.\\"?","output":"The statement \\"A gentleman walking in the street\\" does not necessarily imply that \\"A gentleman is on his way to a store.\\" Though it is possible that the gentleman is, indeed, heading towards a store, this information is not provided in the statement. We can only conclude that the gentleman is walking in the street. Here, it is essential to establish a distinction between the two types of reasoning: deductive and inductive. Deductive reasoning implies the drawing of conclusions based on logical premises and facts. It demands that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be correct. Deductive reasoning requires every tidbit of relevant information, and if the information is accurate, the result should yield definite conclusions. In the case of \\"A gentleman walking in the street,\\" we only know that he is walking, with no further information. We cannot apply deductive reasoning to assert that he is heading towards a store. Thus, the statement does not logically follow deductive reasoning rules. Inductive reasoning, on the other hand, involves drawing conclusions based on incomplete information or patterns of occurrence. In this case, it means that even if the available data is not sufficient to derive a conclusion, we can still attempt to make an educated guess. Inductive reasoning aims to develop the most probable outcome, even though it is not always guaranteed to be accurate. If we were to apply inductive reasoning to the given statement, we might assume that \\"A gentleman is on his way to a store\\" based on our knowledge of common activities while walking in the street. However, this assumption would be nothing more than speculation, as there are countless reasons why a person would be walking in the street: going to work, visiting friends, exercising, or simply because they enjoy walking. In summary, while it is possible to use inductive reasoning to speculate that a gentleman is on his way to a store, this conclusion is not logically supported using deductive reasoning.

Sung by Jagger, the song refers to the Devil, written in the first-person narrative, recounting atrocities committed throughout the history of humanity as if they were somehow \\"inspired\\" (or at least witnessed) by him. Although it has been deemed by some as \\"a homage\\", in reality, no admiration (or even sympathy, for that matter) is declared for the Devil in the song -other than his \\"own\\" request. It is performed in a rock arrangement with a samba rhythm, first appearing as the opening track on their 1968 album Beggars Banquet. Context: The recording of \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" began at London's Olympic Sound Studios on 4 June 1968 and continued into the next day; overdubs were done on 8, 9 and 10 June. Personnel included on the recording include Nicky Hopkins on piano, Rocky Dijon on congas and Bill Wyman on maracas. Marianne Faithfull, Anita Pallenberg, Brian Jones, Charlie Watts, producer Jimmy Miller, Wyman and Richards performed backup vocals, singing the \\"woo woos\\". Richards plays bass on the original recording, and also electric guitar. Brian Jones plays a mostly mixed out acoustic guitar, although in isolated tracks of the studio cut, it is audible playing along with the piano.  In the 2003 book According to the Rolling Stones, Watts commented:  \\"Sympathy\\" was one of those sort of songs where we tried everything. The first time I ever heard the song was when Mick was playing it at the front door of a house I lived at in Sussex ... He played it entirely on his own ... and it was fantastic. We had a go at loads of different ways of playing it; in the end I just played a jazz Latin feel in the style of Kenny Clarke would have played on \\"A Night in Tunisia\\" - not the actual rhythm he played, but the same styling.  On the overall power of the song, Jagger continued in Rolling Stone:  It has a very hypnotic groove, a samba, which has a tremendous hypnotic power, rather like good dance music. It doesn't speed up or slow down. It keeps this constant groove. Plus, the actual samba rhythm is a great one to sing on, but it is also got some other suggestions in it, an undercurrent of being primitive--because it is a primitive African, South American, Afro-whatever-you-call-that rhythm (candomble). So to white people, it has a very sinister thing about it. But forgetting the cultural colors, it is a very good vehicle for producing a powerful piece. It becomes less pretentious because it is a very unpretentious groove. If it had been done as a ballad, it wouldn't have been as good. Question: Who produced the song?. Whats the answer?","output":"The song \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" was produced by Jimmy Miller. He worked with the Rolling Stones on the recording at London's Olympic Sound Studios in June 1968, and he also contributed to the backup vocals, singing the \\"woo woos\\" alongside other band members and personnel."},{"instruction":"Q: Write a correct answer for the question.

So Kathryn stopped and gave a few toys to the kids and played with them for a while. \\"The parents couldn't thank me enough for what I did for their children,\\" she says. On the drive back to Evansville, Kathryn came up with an idea to help more kids. She talked her family, friends and neighbors into joining her and spent the next few months organizing fundraisers. Finally, in August 2007, she showed C.J.'s Bus, a 35-foot school bus that was turned into a mobile playroom. In the following years, stocked with video games and DVDs, toys, crafts, books and more, the bus traveled to disaster-torn towns, giving the children there a safe place to play.

Dan studied more about the subject, and became very interested to pursue it more in the future.  Hint: The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue. The answer is:","output":"Bob. The paragraph states that two medical school students named Dan and Bob learned about the human immune system. However, it is specified that Dan studied more about the subject and became very interested in pursuing it further in the future. The hint provided indicates that the body's inflammatory response to pathogens or injuries includes signs such as redness, warmth, and pain at the infected skin area.

Restoration of the elaborate decor of the interior had to be fully redone.

Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Humans could not live on Earth if it were not for protists. Why? Plant-like protists produce almost one-half of the oxygen on the planet through photosynthesis. Other protists decompose and recycle nutrients that humans need to live. All protists make up a huge part of the food chain.   Q: What produces almost one-half of the earth's oxygen through photosynthesis?   Choices:  - prokaryotes  - algae  - arthropods  - protists  A: Answer:","output":"Protists From the given paragraph, it can be inferred that plant-like protists are responsible for producing almost one-half of the Earth's oxygen through the process of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy, which is stored as glucose or other sugars. Oxygen is a byproduct of this process and is essential for the survival of humans and other aerobic organisms on Earth. Protists are a diverse group of eukaryotic organisms, including both single-celled and multi-celled life forms. They are not classified under plants, animals, or fungi, but rather belong to their own unique category. Among the various types of protists, the plant-like protists generate significant amounts of oxygen through photosynthesis. These plant-like protists primarily consist of different types of algae, including green algae, red algae, brown algae, and diatoms. Despite the keywords \\"protists\\" and \\"algae\\" both being available as options, it is important to note that algae is a subgroup within the protists, specifically referring to the plant-like protists performing photosynthesis. Although algae do contribute to a significant portion of oxygen production, the correct answer in this context is \\"protists,\\" as it encompasses the entire group of organisms responsible for nearly half of the oxygen production on Earth. In addition, the paragraph also highlights the importance of protists in various aspects of life on Earth, such as decomposing and recycling nutrients and forming a key component of the food chain. This further emphasizes the vital role protists play in maintaining the balance and sustainability of Earth's ecosystems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Assange founded WikiLeaks in 2006, but came to international attention in 2010, when WikiLeaks published a series of leaks provided by Chelsea Manning. These leaks included the Collateral Murder video (April 2010), the Afghanistan war logs (July 2010), the Iraq war logs (October 2010), and CableGate (November 2010). Following the 2010 leaks, the federal government of the United States launched a criminal investigation into WikiLeaks and asked allied nations for assistance. Assange visited Sweden in August 2010. During his visit, he became the subject of sexual assault allegations from two women with whom he had sex. He was questioned, the case was initially closed, and he was told he could leave the country. In November 2010, however, the case was re-opened by a special prosecutor who said that she wanted to question Assange over two counts of sexual molestation, one count of unlawful coercion and one count of \\"lesser-degree rape\\" (mindre grov valdtakt). Assange denied the allegations and said he was happy to face questions in Britain.  In 2010, the prosecutor said Swedish law prevented her from questioning anyone by video link or in the London embassy. In March 2015, after public criticism from other Swedish law practitioners, she changed her mind and agreed to interrogate Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, with interviews finally beginning on 14 November 2016. These interviews involved police, Swedish prosecutors and Ecuadorian officials and were eventually published online. By this time, the statute of limitations had expired on all three of the less serious allegations. Since the Swedish prosecutor had not interviewed Assange by 18 August 2015, the questioning pertained only to the open investigation of \\"lesser degree rape\\", whose statute of limitations is due to expire in 2020.  On 19 May 2017, the Swedish authorities dropped their investigation against Assange, claiming they could not expect the Ecuadorian Embassy to communicate reliably with Assange with respect to the case. Chief prosecutor Marianne Ny officially revoked his arrest warrant, but said the investigation could still be resumed if Assange visited Sweden before August 2020. \\"We are not making any pronouncement about guilt\\", she said.

Having worked with producer David Bendeth on their previous album \\"Riot!,\\" this time the band collaborated with producer Rob Cavallo, known for his work with successful acts like Green Day, My Chemical Romance, and Avril Lavigne. The writing and recording process for \\"Brand New Eyes\\" turned out to be tumultuous, with tensions arising within the band, particularly between lead vocalist Hayley Williams and guitarist/songwriter Josh Farro. Despite this internal turmoil, the album delivered a compelling mix of the band's catchy pop-punk sound, combined with introspective, emotionally driven lyrics. \\"Brand New Eyes\\" debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200 chart upon its release, with over 175,000 copies sold in its first week in the United States. Not only did it receive widespread critical acclaim, but it also won the band several prestigious awards, including the Best Album in the 2010 Kerrang!

However, the band would later experience lineup changes as guitarist Josh Farro and drummer Zac Farro left the band in December 2010. In conclusion, \\"Playing God\\" is a standout track from Paramore's third studio album, \\"Brand New Eyes,\\" released in 2009 through the record label Fueled by Ramen.

This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly.  and the situation: Harry and Kim studied ancient humans. Kim studied a 15000 year-old settlement, before humans invented agriculture, while Harry studied a 5000 year-old village.  Answer the following question: Which student studied about a village that had a more dependable food supply? A:","output":"Harry studied a village that had a more dependable food supply. As mentioned in the background information, agriculture was invented around 10,000 years ago and provided humans with a more reliable and abundant food source. This allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time, and consequently, birth rates increased due to the availability of more food and the benefits of a settled life. On the other hand, Kim studied a 15,000-year-old settlement, which predates the invention of agriculture by around 5,000 years. During this time, humans were predominantly hunter-gatherers, relying on foraging, hunting, and fishing for sustenance. This lifestyle did not offer a dependable food supply as resources were seasonal and often required significant effort and mobility to locate. In conclusion, Harry's 5,000-year-old village study provided insights into a time when humans had a more stable and dependable food supply, thanks to the invention of agriculture. Whereas, Kim's study of the 15,000-year-old settlement focused on a period before the onset of agricultural practices, when humans were more reliant on hunting and gathering, which was comparatively less reliable as a food source."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It's not a long time for a newcomer, and there are still a lot of things to do. Sorry for not being able to write to you soon. London is an old but beautiful city. There are lots of places of interest to visit. Last weekend I went along Thames River with some friends from Japan, Korea and some other countries. The modern skyscrapers  among the old buildings impressed(...) us deeply. The classes started two weeks after I arrived here alone. Besides the language, I'm trying to learn about the culture as well. British people are quite different from the Chinese. Do you know the people here do not shake hands as much as we do in China? And it's never a good habit to make noise when you eat. They think it's impolite. There is so much to say, but I have to stop. I will write to you soon again. Love, Harry Last weekend Harry was impressed by   _  . A) London's long history B) the modern skyscrapers C) London's old buildings D) the English culture Answer:","output":"Last weekend, Harry was impressed by B) the modern skyscrapers. In the letter, Harry mentions that he and his friends were deeply impressed by the modern skyscrapers among the old buildings while they were walking along the Thames River.

Help as much as you can. Given the question: I can use this background: As shown here, pressure decreases to less than 25% of ground-level atmospheric pressure when we get to an altitude of about six miles. Since this is a common cruising altitude for commercial airplanes, pressurized cabins are needed for the comfort and survival of the passengers. This is because the density of the air decreases along with the decreasing air pressure, so there is less oxygen in a breath of air. You've probably noticed this effect in high-mountain areas, as it often feels harder to breath.  Now, I have a new situation: Pam and Angela live in different cities and are talking to each other on the phone while they are sitting outside. Pam lives in Dunder, a city located at sea level, and Angela lives in Mifflin, a city up high in the mountains. Although they don't get to see each other much any more due to the distance between them, they make sure to stay in regular contact.  Answer this question please: Which woman gets more oxygen per single breath? The answer is:","output":"Pam gets more oxygen per single breath. This is because she lives in Dunder, a city located at sea level, where the air pressure is higher, and therefore the air is denser. In contrast, Angela lives in Mifflin, a city high in the mountains, where the air pressure is lower and the air is less dense, resulting in less oxygen in a breath of air."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While their candidate is riding high — and will be sworn in as the country’s 45th president in just 61 days — their portfolio is feeling a little tattered. Since Election Day, Smith & Wesson shares were down 15 percent heading into Monday’s opening bell. Shares of Sturm, Ruger were down 17 percent over the same span. And the pain may not be temporary. Americans who raced to gun shops to buy guns over the past four years — and in the four weeks leading up to Nov. 8 — out of fear Pres. Obama and Hillary Clinton (who was then leading in the polls) would soon move to cut off their Second Amendment rights, are now slowing the buying spree. Gun shop owners are seeing a steep drop-off in sales since Election Day. Dave Larsen, the sales manager at Doug’s Shoot’n Sports in Salt Lake City told the local Fox TV affiliate that business is off since Trump won. “I did have one gentleman order a gun from me on Tuesday, and then after the election results came in he called me and said, ‘Dave, let’s cancel that order,’” Larsen said. “I asked him point blank, ‘Is this because Donald won?’ And he said, ‘Yeah, kind of.’ ” Larsen said the customer later decided to keep the gun. It’s quite a let down for gun shop owners who saw record sales in October. After posting double-digit declines over the eight trading days since Election Day, Smith & Wesson shares picked up on Monday, jumping 2.2 percent in morning trading, to 24.66.

Article: A volcanic eruption in Iceland has sent ash across northern Europe. Airlines have stopped or changed the flights across the Atlantic Ocean, leaving hundreds of passengers stuck in airports. Grimsvotn is one of the largest and most active volcanoes in Europe. What makes Grimsvotn different is that it lies under a huge glacier of ice up to 12 metres thick. The hot volcano heats up the ice above it, which then forms a layer  of water between glacier and the volcano, keeping it stable. As the water flows out from under the glacier, the pressure lifts. The lava  from the volcano then comes up to the surface. This is exactly what is happening today. Now airlines have to make changes to their flights so as not to fly through the clouds of volcanic ash. According to KLM, one of Europe's biggest airlines, airplanes cannot go under the cloud or over it. Going through the cloud can result in ash getting stuck in the airplane's engines, causing damage to the plane. The eruption has also caused problems for animals in Iceland. The volcano left ash and sharp, glass-like rocks all over the countryside. Farmers are keeping their animals inside to stop them eating ash-covered grass or the sharp objects.

A 20-year-old Texas man who was convicted of raping of a teenage schoolmate but sentenced to only five years' probation must also undergo the standard probationary conditions, including evaluation for sex offender treatment, a Dallas district court judge ruled Thursday. Sir Young pleaded guilty to the attack on a 14-year-old girl at a Dallas high school in 2011. Judge Jeanine Howard, who sentenced Young last week, did not impose the standard probationary conditions. She said he was 'not your typical sex offender' and questioned whether the girl had embellished her story. He was ordered to spend 45 days in jail. The initial punishment for Young sparked a backlash when a prior judge in","output":"the case, Judge Jeanine Howard, faced criticism for issuing a lenient sentence and not imposing standard probationary conditions on Young. Many argued that this decision sent a dangerous message regarding sexual assault, diminishing the gravity of the crime and potentially discouraging other victims from coming forward. In response to the public outcry and to ensure that the justice system upholds its responsibility of protecting victims and holding perpetrators accountable, the Dallas district court judge revisited Young's case. Given the severity of the offense and the urgency to maintain the credibility of the legal system, the judge decided to impose the standard probationary conditions on Young, in addition to the initial 45 days in jail. This decision ultimately demonstrates that the judiciary system acknowledges the importance of enforcing proper consequences for those convicted of sexual assault, regardless of whether they fit the label of a \\"typical\\" sex offender.

Unfortunately, after using the device for a couple of weeks, I was left disappointed by a few glaring issues. Issue 1 - Poor Battery Life: The PhoneX's battery life is abysmal. Even with moderate usage, the phone barely lasts through the day, requiring me to carry a portable charger with me everywhere. The quick charging feature promised in the advertisement doesn't seem to make up for this major drawback. Issue 2 - Unresponsive Touchscreen: To make matters worse, the phone's touchscreen frequently becomes unresponsive, causing delays in basic tasks such as unlocking the device or typing a text message. This has led me to miss important calls and messages, while making me feel frustrated with the overall user experience. Positive Aspects: Despite these issues, I do appreciate the phone's sleek design, and when the touchscreen works, the interface is easy to navigate. The camera quality is also commendable, producing sharp and vibrant images. Conclusion-Final thoughts: While the PhoneX has some redeeming qualities, its poor battery life and unresponsive touchscreen significantly hinder the overall user experience. I would not recommend this device until these issues are addressed in a future update."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Scotland, it was written in places, descended into a \\"sorry heap\\" at Twickenham, they were by turns \\"brainless\\" and an \\"embarrassment\\". What happened down there was \\"a rout\\", \\"a surrender\\", \\"a humiliation, \\"a pathetic showing\\". This wasn't just kicking a team when they were down, this was a savaging done with a smile and the visitors left themselves wide open to it. So many strong, and justified, words were used about the way Scotland played and the manner in which they were coursed around Twickenham for 80 minutes, but the most memorable was one used by not just a Scottish player, but the Scottish captain. \\"Useless,\\" said John Barclay.  Nobody was of a mind to disagree with him. It's not coaches that are needed in the Scotland camp this week, it's psychologists. And medics, of course. Lots of them. Seven England tries and now seven more injuries to add to the misery. Physically, emotionally, spiritually - and every other type of ally you care to mention - that was one bruising day at Twickenham. Mark Bennett has already been ruled out of the Italy game on Saturday, thereby joining Greig Laidlaw, Duncan Taylor, Alasdair Dickinson, WP Nel, Josh Strauss and John Hardie in the cast of the stricken. Stuart Hogg, Tommy Seymour and Ryan Wilson are trying to recover in time after getting concussed. Finn Russell and Huw Jones have to get scans on knee knocks. Richie Gray is getting one on his hamstring. James Robson, the team doctor, may as well borrow a flashing ambulance light and stick it on his head for the next week. He's going to be a busy, busy man. Scotland were caught in the perfect storm on Saturday. They chose this day of all days to deliver a giant calamity of a display, a day when England produced one of their best Tests in years. England were quietly brooding after some bad press, a little angry at the flak sent their way after Italy, maybe a little embarrassed at their slowness in dealing with Italy's tactics, perhaps a tad indignant at all the chat about the revived Scots and how they were heading south to consign 1983 to the dustbin once and for all. The hosts had motivation coming out of their ears. Scotland had weakness coming out of the woodwork. What they need to do now is clear. They need to harness the hurt and use it against Italy in their final match of the Six Nations and the farewell Test in Vern Cotter's reign. They need to do to the Italians what England did to them. Power, pace, deception, invention, tries and more tries. A bonus-point win sends them back up the table from their current slot in fifth. A good season is still there to be secured if the Italians are blasted. The horror of Twickenham can be lessened if Scotland finish third in the table with three wins and a six-point loss in Paris when injury befell them in freakish circumstances. That's definite progress. Twickenham will hang in the air like the dirtiest cloud. That can't be erased, but neither should the victories over Ireland and Wales. Scotland are moving forward, but there was the most brutal reality check on Saturday. When England get it right they're on a different planet. But here's the news. When England get it right they're a match for New Zealand at their ultimate. On Saturday's form, England would happily go toe-to-toe with the All Blacks, home or away, summer, autumn, winter or spring. On Saturday, Scotland have a chance to finish with a flourish, but you have to fear now that terminal damage has been done to their hopes of having a chunky representation on the Lions tour. It was instructive to hear Warren Gatland's words when he visited Scotland last week. The Lions coach spoke of the importance of the game at Twickenham, suggesting that winning matches at home was proof of Scotland's improvement, but that winning games away from home was what he was looking for from the Scotland contenders. Had Scotland lived with England and taken them to the wire then Gatland would have had some interesting decisions to make. He'd have seen players going to an intimidating stadium and standing up to a champion team. They're the kind of customers he needs in New Zealand. The fact that they were brutalised puts an image in the head of the Kiwi taking out a red pen and drawing a line through the names of those Scots who advanced their case so impressively against Ireland and Wales. England will make up the bulk of Gatland's squad, which will number about 38 players.  If they go on and win a second Grand Slam while setting a new world record for consecutive Test wins then as many as 20 of Eddie Jones' squad could travel - and they'd go on merit. If they're denied in Dublin then the by-product of that would be more Irishmen on the tour. Either way, it's bad news for Scotland. They had a lamentable day that probably destroyed the Lions chances of all bar three or four, but they've got to go again. The good work they've done this season demands a proper finale against Italy, a resounding response to the nightmare.

Substituting the values of a and b, we have: [ c = sqrt{a^2 - b^2} = sqrt{2^2 - (sqrt{3})^2} = sqrt{4 - 3} = sqrt{1} = 1. ] Since the major axis lies along the x-axis, the right focus will have a positive x-coordinate equal to c and a y-coordinate of zero.

(A rook attacks all the squares it can reach according to chess rules without passing through other pieces.)","output":"1. We need to determine the maximum number of rooks that can be placed on a 300 times 300 chessboard such that each rook attacks no more than one other rook. By definition, a rook attacks all squares along its row and column up to the next piece or the edge of the board. 2. Let us establish an upper bound on the number of rooks. Suppose each row and column can have at most two rooks. If any row or column had more than two rooks, the rook not on the edge would attack at least two other rooks, violating the given condition. 3. Assume there are k columns with exactly two rooks each. In each such column, the rooks would attack each other, necessitating that no other rooks be in their respective rows. Consequently, this configuration reduces the number of rows available to place additional rooks by 2k. 4. Now, let's calculate the available rows for additional rooks:    [    300 - 2k    ]    In these 300 - 2k available rows, at most two rooks can be placed per row:    [    2(300 - 2k)    ] 5. Taking into account the rooks placed in the k columns where each column has two rooks:    [    2k    ]    Therefore, the total number of rooks can be expressed as:    [    2(300 - 2k) + 2k = 600 - 2k    ] 6. Conversely, let us denote that there are k columns, each containing two rooks, and the remaining 300 - k columns contain at most one rook each:    [    300 - k    ]    Thus, the total in this context is:    [    (300 - k) + 2k = 300 + k    ] 7. We need to ensure that the total number of rooks does not exceed the evaluated bounds. Averaging the constraints:    [    frac{1}{3} left( (600 - 2k) + 2(300 + k) right) = frac{1}{3} (600 - 2k + 600 + 2k) = frac{1}{3} times 1200 = 400    ] 8. Consequently, the maximum number of rooks that can satisfy the given condition is:    [    boxed{400}    ] 9. Finally, we demonstrate that this maximum can be achieved. Consider a 3 times 3 board, where it is possible to place 4 rooks such that each rook attacks no more than one other rook. By tiling the 300 times 300 board with 100 times 100 such 3 times 3 configurations, we can place:    [    100 times 4 = 400    ]    rooks, satisfying the given condition on a 300 times 300 chessboard. 10.

Substitute the coordinates of the center (3, 1) into the equation of the circle:    [    (x - 3)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = R^2    ] 4. Since the circle passes through the origin, we substitute O(0, 0) into the equation to find the radius R:    [    (0 - 3)^2 + (0 - 1)^2 = R^2    ] 5. Calculate the values:    [    (-3)^2 + (-1)^2 = 9 + 1 = 10    ]    Hence,        [    R^2 = 10    ] 6.

Therefore, the total number of slices in five loaves of bread is equal to the total consumption over three days, which is 60 slices.

This specific pattern will ensure that each 3 times 3 block meets the criterion where at least 3 cells are colored. 3. **Calculating the Number of Cells Colored:**    - Since we are coloring cells diagonally every three cells, essentially we are coloring frac{N^2}{3} cells.    - For N = 35, the number of cells to be colored can be calculated as follows:      [      leftlfloor frac{35^2}{3} rightrfloor      ]    - Simplifying the above expression:      [      frac{35^2}{3} = frac{1225}{3} = 408.3333      ]    - Taking the floor function because we cannot color a partial cell:      [      leftlfloor 408.3333 rightrfloor = 408      ] 4. **Verification:**    - By choosing this efficient strategy, every 3x3 block will contain cells that ensure any corner cell group (4-cell L shape) has at least one cell colored, because within any 3x3 block of 9 cells, at least 3 cells are guaranteed to be colored.

According to the problem, when Kolya was as old as the sum of their current ages ((x + y)), the sister’s age at that time was equal to the brother's current age (x).     This can be set up as the first equation:     [     t_1 + x = x + y implies t_1 = y     ]     where (t_1) is the number of years ago when this condition occurred. So, (t_1) years ago, Kolya’s age was (x + y) and the sister’s age was (x). 3. Therefore:     [     y = (x + y) - t_1 rightarrow t_1 = y     ]      4.

We need to prove that the sum of distances from M to the vertices of the triangle ABC achieves a minimum value when M lies inside the triangle such that each side of the triangle is seen from M under an angle of 120^circ. 2. **Rotation**:     We will rotate triangle AMC around vertex A by 60^circ in the direction external to triangle ABC. Specifically:     - Upon rotation, point C moves to a new position, labeled C_1.     - Consequently, point M moves to a new position, labeled M_1.          This means that the rotated configuration of triangle AMC becomes triangle AMC_1 with M moving to M_1. 3. **Path and Length Calculation**:     Consider the sum of distances |AM| + |BM| + |CM|. After the rotation, observe that point M at M_1 lies such that:     [     |AM| + |BM| + |CM| = |AM| + |BM| + |M_1C_1|     ] 4. **Geometric Interpretation**:     Notice that A, M, and M_1 lie on a straight line (ray) emerging from A. The path B rightarrow M rightarrow M_1 rightarrow C_1 forms a broken line that can be minimized to a straight line segment when M and M_1 are collinear, precisely when M lies on the segment BC_1. 5. **Conditions for Minimum**:     The condition for this minimum sum of distances |AM| + |BM| + |CM| is that when M and M_1 align directly on the same line segment between B and C_1. This situation occurs geometry-wise when M is the point inside the original triangle ABC such that every side BC is seen under 120^circ from M. **Conclusion**: Summarizing the above observations, M achieves the condition that minimizes |AM| + |BM| + |CM| when it is the Fermat point under the given angle conditions of the triangle. The proof is complete as this conforms to the requirement that each side must be viewed under 120^circ from this optimal point.

We can calculate this by considering Cheryl drawing first:    - Cheryl draws 2 marbles of the same color. There are 3 pairs of colors (red, green, yellow), and she can draw any one pair:      [      binom{3}{1} = 3      ]    - The remaining marbles are 4, consisting of two colors with one marble each and one color with no marbles. Carol and Claudia then draw from these:      [      binom{4}{2} = 6, quad binom{2}{2} = 1      ]    Thus, the number of favorable outcomes is:    [    3 times 6 times 1 = 18    ] 3. **Probability calculation:**    The probability that Cheryl gets 2 marbles of the same color is the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes:    [    frac{18}{90} = frac{1}{5}    ] Thus, the probability that Cheryl gets 2 marbles of the same color is boxed{frac{1}{5}}.

When Gauss was in elementary school, he calculated the sum of 1+2+3+cdots +100 as follows: 1+100=101, 2+99=101, ..., 50+51=101. There are a total of 50 pairs, so 50times 101=5050. This is the famous Gauss algorithm, and the method of deriving the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence in textbooks is based on the Gauss algorithm. Given that the positive sequence {a_{n}} is a geometric sequence with a common ratio not equal to 1, and a_{1}a_{2023}=1, explore the following: If f(x)=frac{4}{{1+{x^2}}}, then f(a_{1})+f(a_{2})+cdots +f(a_{2023})=left(  right) A: 2023 B: 4046 C: 2022 D: 4044","output":"Given the information, we start by understanding the property of the geometric sequence {a_{n}} where a_{1}a_{2023}=1.

This is because the product of the terms equidistant from the start and end of the sequence equals 1, a property derived from the given a_{1}a_{2023}=1. Given the function f(x)=frac{4}{{1+{x^2}}}, we need to find the sum f(a_{1})+f(a_{2})+cdots +f(a_{2023}). To simplify this, we look at the sum of a term and its 'partner' in the sequence, f(x)+fleft(frac{1}{x}right): [ f(x)+fleft(frac{1}{x}right) = frac{4}{{1+{x^2}}}+frac{4}{{1+left(frac{1}{{x^2}}right)}} = frac{4}{{1+{x^2}}}+frac{4x^2}{{x^2+1}} = frac{4+4x^2}{{1+{x^2}}} = 4 ] This calculation shows that each pair of terms in the sequence, when applied to the function f(x), sums to 4. Since there are 2023 terms in the sequence, and each term pairs with another to give a sum of 4, we can calculate the total sum T as follows: Let T = f(a_{1})+f(a_{2})+cdots +f(a_{2023}). By the symmetry in the sequence, we also have T = f(a_{2023})+f(a_{2022})+cdots +f(a_{1}). Adding these two expressions for T together gives us 2T, which equals the sum of paired terms: [ 2T = (f(a_{1})+f(a_{2023})) + (f(a_{2})+f(a_{2022})) + cdots + (f(a_{2023})+f(a_{1})) = 4 times 2023 ] Solving for T gives us: [ 2T = 4 times 2023 Rightarrow T = 2 times 2023 = 4046 ] Therefore, the sum f(a_{1})+f(a_{2})+cdots +f(a_{2023}) equals 4046.

The term x^4 - 9 can be further factorized as it is also a difference of squares:    x^4 - 9 = (x^2 - 3)(x^2 + 3). 4. The term x^4 + 9 does not neatly factorize into real numbers, so we leave it as it is.

Step 1: Recognize the properties of the triangles within the quadrilateral. Since ABCD has right angles at B and D, triangles triangle ABC and triangle ADC are right triangles sharing the hypotenuse AC. The Pythagorean theorem applies to both triangles, giving us: [AB^2 + BC^2 = AD^2 + DC^2 = AC^2 = 3^2 = 9.] Step 2: Determine possible integer lengths for the sides. Given that ABCD must have two sides with distinct integer lengths, and considering the equation derived from the Pythagorean theorem, the only possible integer values for AB, BC, AD, or DC are 1 and 2. This is because these are the only integers whose squares can sum up to 9 in any combination. Step 3: Assign lengths to the sides of the triangles. Without loss of generality, we can assume one leg of triangle ABC is 1 and one leg of triangle ADC is 2. The specific assignment of these lengths to AB, BC, AD, or DC does not affect the overall area calculation due to the symmetry in the problem's conditions. Step 4: Calculate the lengths of the remaining sides.

When the graph is shifted to the left by frac{pi}{4} units, the input to the function f is effectively increased by frac{pi}{4}. Therefore, [ g(x) = fleft(x+frac{pi}{4}right) = sinleft[2left(x+frac{pi}{4}right)-frac{pi}{3}right] = sinleft(2x+frac{pi}{2}-frac{pi}{3}right) = cosleft(2x-frac{pi}{3}right). ] Hence, the expression of function g(x) is boxed{cosleft(2x-frac{pi}{3}right)}.

The function y=2t+frac{1}{t} decreases for tin [frac{1}{2},frac{sqrt{2}}{2}] and increases for tin (frac{sqrt{2}}{2},1]. Therefore, we conclude 2sqrt{2}leqslant 2t+frac{1}{t}leqslant 3.

Notice that all the intermediate terms cancel out, leaving us with: = frac {1}{2}left( frac {1}{3} - frac {1}{2n+3} right). Simplifying the expression yields: = frac {n}{6n+9}.

For given values of ( k ) and ( t ) to be valid, we must solve the quadratic equation formed by the relationships:    [    u^2 - frac{k}{2} u + t = 0    ]    where ( u ) represents the sides ( x ) and ( y ). 4.

First Solution Approach: 1. **Combine Terms Over a Common Denominator:**        The common denominator for all three terms is ((a-b)(a-c)(b-c)). Therefore:    [    f(x) = frac{(b-c)(x+a)^2 - (a-c)(x+b)^2 + (a-b)(x+c)^2}{(a-b)(a-c)(b-c)}.    ] 2. **Expand the Numerator:**    Let's expand each quadratic term in the numerator:    [    (b-c)(x+a)^2 = (b-c)(x^2 + 2ax + a^2),    ]    [    (a-c)(x+b)^2 = (a-c)(x^2 + 2bx + b^2),    ]    [    (a-b)(x+c)^2 = (a-b)(x^2 + 2cx + c^2).    ]    Now, let’s expand and collect all terms:    [    (b-c)(x^2 + 2ax + a^2) = (b-c)x^2 + 2a(b-c)x + a^2(b-c),    ]    [    (a-c)(x^2 + 2bx + b^2) = (a-c)x^2 + 2b(a-c)x + b^2(a-c),    ]    [    (a-b)(x^2 + 2cx + c^2) = (a-b)x^2 + 2c(a-b)x + c^2(a-b).    ] 3. **Combine and Simplify:**     [    f(x) = frac{(b-c)x^2 + 2a(b-c)x + a^2(b-c) - (a-c)x^2 - 2b(a-c)x - b^2(a-c) + (a-b)x^2 + 2c(a-b)x + c^2(a-b)}{(a-b)(a-c)(b-c)}.    ]    Combine similar terms:    [    f(x) = frac{(b-c)x^2 + (a-b)x^2 - (a-c)x^2 + 2a(b-c)x + 2c(a-b)x - 2b(a-c)x + a^2(b-c) + c^2(a-b) - b^2(a-c)}{(a-b)(a-c)(b-c)}.    ]    Notice that:    [    (b-c)x^2 + (a-b)x^2 - (a-c)x^2 = 0,    ]    [    2a(b-c)x + 2c(a-b)x - 2b(a-c)x = 0,    ]    [    a^2(b-c) + c^2(a-b) - b^2(a-c) = 0.    ]    Therefore, the simplification results in:    [    f(x) = frac{0}{(a-b)(a-c)(b-c)} = 1.    ] So, the range of ( f(x) ) is: [ boxed{1} ]  Second Solution Approach: 1. **Verify at Specific Points:**    Check the value of ( f(x) ) at particular values ( x = -a ), ( x = -b ), ( x = -c ).    - For ( x = -a ):      [      f(-a) = 0 + frac{(b-a)^2}{(b-a)(b-c)} + frac{(c-a)^2}{(c-a)(c-b)} = 0 + frac{b-a}{b-c} + frac{c-a}{c-b} = 1.      ]        - For ( x = -b ):      [      f(-b) = frac{(a-b)^2}{(a-b)(a-c)} + 0 + frac{(c-b)^2}{(c-a)(c-b)} = frac{a-b}{a-c} + frac{c-b}{c-a} = 1.      ]        - For ( x = -c ):      [      f(-c) = frac{(a-c)^2}{(a-b)(a-c)} + frac{(b-c)^2}{(b-a)(b-c)} + 0 = frac{a-c}{a-b} + frac{b-c}{b-a} = 1.      ] 2. **Conclusion Based on Values at Three Distinct Points:**    Since ( f(x) ) takes the same value (1) at three distinct points and can be expressed as a quadratic polynomial (since each term is quadratic), ( f(x) ) must be constant.

The Law of Sines states that frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} = frac{c}{sin C}, but we will focus on the given equation and the Law of Cosines for this problem. 1. **Using the given equation and the Law of Cosines:**    - The Law of Cosines for side c is c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}-2abcos C.     - By comparing this with the given equation, we can deduce that a^{2}+b^{2}=-4abcos C. 2. **Substituting c^{2}=3ab into the equation:**    - We have c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}-2abcos C.    - Substituting a^{2}+b^{2}=-4abcos C into the above, we get c^{2}=-6abcos C.    - Therefore, cos C=-frac{c^{2}}{6ab}. 3. **Finding cos C:**    - Since c^{2}=3ab, substituting this into cos C=-frac{c^{2}}{6ab} gives cos C=-frac{1}{2}. 4. **Determining angle C:**    - With cos C=-frac{1}{2} and knowing that angle C must be in the range (0, pi), we conclude that C=frac{2pi}{3}. Therefore, the measure of angle C is boxed{frac{2pi}{3}}. # Part (2): Value of φ Given f(x)=sin(omega x+varphi) where omega in mathbb{N}^* and |φ|<frac{pi}{2}, and f(C)=-frac{1}{2} with f(x) being monotonic on the interval (frac{pi}{7},frac{pi}{2}), we proceed as follows: 1. **Considering the monotonicity of f(x):**    - For f(x) to be monotonic in the given interval, the period T=frac{2pi}{omega} must be greater than or equal to twice the difference between frac{pi}{2} and frac{pi}{7}, i.e., T geq 2left(frac{pi}{2}-frac{pi}{7}right) = frac{5pi}{7}.    - This implies frac{2pi}{omega} geq frac{5pi}{7}, leading to omega leq frac{14}{5}. Since omega in mathbb{N}^*, omega can be 1 or 2. 2. **Case analysis for omega:**    - **If omega = 1**, then f(x)=sin(x+varphi). Given f(C)=-frac{1}{2}, we have sinleft(frac{2pi}{3}+varphiright)=-frac{1}{2}. However, considering the constraint |φ|<frac{pi}{2}, this case does not provide a valid solution for varphi.        - **If omega = 2**, then f(x)=sin(2x+varphi). Given f(C)=-frac{1}{2}, we have sinleft(frac{4pi}{3}+varphiright)=-frac{1}{2}. This leads to frac{4pi}{3}+varphi=frac{7pi}{6}, solving for varphi gives varphi=-frac{pi}{6}. 3. **Checking the monotonicity for omega = 2:**    - Substituting omega = 2 and varphi = -frac{pi}{6} into f(x), we get f(x)=sin(2x-frac{pi}{6}). However, for x in (frac{pi}{7},frac{pi}{2}), the function f(x) does not maintain monotonicity throughout the interval. Therefore, based on the given conditions and the analysis, varphi has no solution that satisfies all conditions simultaneously. Hence, the value of varphi is boxed{text{No Solution}}."},{"instruction":"A natural number is abundant if it is less than the sum of its proper divisors.

Set B is defined by the inequality x^2-4x<0. We can factor this into: x(x-4)<0 The product of two terms is less than zero when one term is positive and the other negative. So, our inequality holds when x is between the roots 0 and 4.

Since they are moving in opposite directions, their speeds will add up. The man's speed is 12 kmph, which we need to convert to meters per second (m/s) to be consistent with the other units given in the problem. We use the conversion factor that 1 kmph is equal to 5/18 m/s. So, the man's speed in m/s is: 12 kmph * (5/18) m/s per kmph = (12 * 5/18) m/s = (2/3 * 5) m/s = 10/3 m/s The train passes the man completely in 10 seconds, and the length of the train is 500 meters. This means that the relative speed between the train and the man is the distance covered by the train divided by the time taken to cover that distance. Relative speed = Distance / Time Relative speed = 500 meters / 10 seconds = 50 m/s Now, we know the relative speed is the sum of the train's speed and the man's speed. Let's denote the train's speed as V_train (in m/s). V_train + V_man = Relative speed V_train + (10/3) m/s = 50 m/s Now, we solve for V_train: V_train = 50 m/s - (10/3) m/s V_train = (150/3) m/s - (10/3) m/s V_train = (140/3) m/s To convert the train's speed back to kmph, we use the conversion factor in reverse (1 m/s is equal to 18/5 kmph): V_train (in kmph) = (140/3) m/s * (18/5) kmph per m/s V_train (in kmph) = (140 * 18) / (3 * 5) kmph V_train (in kmph) = (2520 / 15) kmph V_train (in kmph) = 168 kmph Therefore, the speed of the train is boxed{168}  kmph."},{"instruction":"A number minus (1002 divided by 20.04) equals 2984.

A partition (pi) of (S) is a way of dividing (S) into non-empty, disjoint subsets whose union is (S). For any (x in S), let (pi(x)) denote the size of the subset containing (x) in the partition (pi). 2. **Claim 1:**    We claim that in any partition (pi) of (S), there can be at most 3 distinct subset sizes.        **Proof of Claim 1:**    Suppose, for contradiction, that there are 4 distinct subset sizes. Let these sizes be (a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4) with (a_1 leq a_2 leq a_3 leq a_4). Since the total number of elements is 9, we have:    [    a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 9    ]    The smallest possible values for (a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4) that satisfy this equation are 1, 2, 3, and 3 (since (1 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 9)). However, this means that we have used up all 9 elements, and there is no room for a fourth distinct size. Therefore, there can be at most 3 distinct subset sizes in any partition of (S). 3. **Claim 2:**    Given a partition (pi), we can find at least 10 pairs ((x, y)) such that (pi(x) = pi(y)).        **Proof of Claim 2:**    We aim to minimize the expression (binom{a}{2} + binom{b}{2} + binom{c}{2}) where (a + b + c = 9). The binomial coefficient (binom{n}{2}) represents the number of ways to choose 2 elements from a set of (n) elements, which is given by:    [    binom{n}{2} = frac{n(n-1)}{2}    ]    To minimize (binom{a}{2} + binom{b}{2} + binom{c}{2}), we choose the smallest distinct values for (a, b, c) that sum to 9. The smallest such values are 2, 3, and 4. Thus, we have:    [    binom{2}{2} + binom{3}{2} + binom{4}{2} = 1 + 3 + 6 = 10    ]    Therefore, there are at least 10 pairs ((x, y)) such that (pi(x) = pi(y)). 4. **Main Proof:**    Let (pi) and (pi') be two partitions of (S). We need to show that there exist two distinct numbers (x) and (y) in (S) such that (pi(x) = pi(y)) and (pi'(x) = pi'(y)).    Suppose, for contradiction, that no such pair ((x, y)) exists. This means that for every pair ((x, y)) such that (pi(x) = pi(y)), we have (pi'(x) neq pi'(y)), and vice versa. However, from Claim 2, we know that there are at least 10 pairs ((x, y)) such that (pi(x) = pi(y)) and at least 10 pairs ((x, y)) such that (pi'(x) = pi'(y)). Since there are only (binom{9}{2} = 36) possible pairs of elements in (S), the total number of pairs is 36. If no pair ((x, y)) satisfies both (pi(x) = pi(y)) and (pi'(x) = pi'(y)), then the total number of pairs would be at least (10 + 10 = 20), which is a contradiction because 20 is less than 36. Therefore, there must exist at least one pair ((x, y)) such that (pi(x) = pi(y)) and (pi'(x) = pi'(y)).

The focus of a parabola y^2 = 2px is (frac{p}{2}, 0).

This means we need to correct the approach for determining |MN|. 3. **Check the circle with MN as its diameter is tangent to l:**    The x-coordinate of the midpoint of M and N is frac{5}{3}, which is correct since it's the average of the x-coordinates of M and N. The directrix of the parabola y^2 = 4x is x = -1 (since p=2 and the directrix is x = -frac{p}{2}).

A permutation is called bad if in it you can find 10 numbers (not necessarily consecutive) that are in descending order. The remaining permutations are called good. Prove that the number of good arrangements does not exceed 81^n. # Detailed Solution: 1. **Goal and Strategy**: The first step is to prove that if a permutation is good, then the sequence can be colored using nine colors such that every number of the same color appears in increasing order.    **Statement**: We need to prove a good arrangement can be colored using at most 9 colors ensuring that the numbers with the same color remain in increasing order. 2. **Coloring Process**: Color the numbers from left to right using the smallest number color ensuring the numbers previously colored with the same color are less than the current number.      - **Assumption**: Assume that nine colors are insufficient.     - **Proof by Contradiction**: Since we cannot use the 9th color, there must exist a larger number already colored with each of the first 8 colors prior to this number needing the 9th color. 3. **Descending Order Result**: For each of the 8 previous colors, there is a larger number, which leads to finding 10 numbers that follow a descending order, contradicting the fact that the permutation is good. Thus, a good permutation can indeed be colored using 9 colors. 4. **Calculation of Good Permutations**:   - Each number from 1 to n can be assigned 9 colors: 9^n ways.   - Each position of 1 to n can be colored by 9 colors: 9^n ways. Therefore, there are at most (9^n) times (9^n) = (9^2)^n = 81^n ways to color the numbers and places such that they form a good permutation. **Conclusion**: Hence, the number of good permutations does not exceed 81^n. boxed{81^n}"},{"instruction":"Do there exist natural numbers ( m ) and ( n ) such that ( m^2 = n^2 + 2014 )?","output":"To determine whether there exist natural numbers m and n such that m^2 = n^2 + 2014, we approach the problem through the following detailed steps: 1. **Rewriting the Equation**:    Start by rewriting the given equation:    [    m^2 = n^2 + 2014    ]    This can be rearranged to express it as a difference of squares:    [    m^2 - n^2 = 2014    ] 2. **Factoring the Difference of Squares**:    We know from algebra that the difference of squares can be factored as follows:    [    m^2 - n^2 = (m - n)(m + n) = 2014    ] 3. **Analyzing the Parity**:    Since 2014 is an even number, we move forward to check the parity of m and n. Both (m - n) and (m + n) must be integers of the same parity because adding or subtracting two integers of the same parity always results in an even number.

All other factor pairs will follow a similar result due to all introducing an odd factor into the mix. 4. **Verification through Modular Arithmetic**:    Another approach is to verify using modular arithmetic if m^2 - n^2 = 2014 can hold. Considering the quadratic residues modulo 4:    [    0^2 equiv 0 pmod{4} quad text{and} quad 1^2 equiv 1 pmod{4}    ]    Therefore, m^2 and n^2 can only be congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4.

The number of books she had after giving some to her nephew is 30, and the number of books she donated is 10. So the ratio is: 10 books donated : 30 books after giving to nephew To simplify the ratio, we divide both numbers by the greatest common divisor, which is 10: (10 books donated / 10) : (30 books after giving to nephew / 10) This simplifies to: 1 : 3 Therefore, the ratio of the number of books she donated to the library to the number of books she had after giving some to her nephew is boxed{1:3} ."},{"instruction":"Distribute four students, named A, B, C, and D, into three different classes, with each class having at least one student.

The Chebyshev polynomials minimize the maximum deviation from zero over the interval ([-1, 1]). 5. **Using the Chebyshev Polynomial:**    The Chebyshev polynomial of the second kind of degree 2, ( T_2(x) ), can be written as:    [    T_2(x) = 2x^2 - 1 implies frac{1}{2} T_2(x) = x^2 - frac{1}{2}    ]    Hence, the polynomial ( x^2 - frac{1}{2} ) has the least maximum value in modulus over the interval ([-1, 1]). 6. **Verification:**    - At ( x = -1 ):      [      P(-1) = (-1)^2 - frac{1}{2} = 1 - frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{2}      ]    - At ( x = 0 ):      [      P(0) = 0^2 - frac{1}{2} = -frac{1}{2}      ]    - At ( x = 1 ):      [      P(1) = (1)^2 - frac{1}{2} = 1 - frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{2}      ]    The maximum absolute value over ([-1, 1]) for this polynomial is indeed (frac{1}{2}), which confirms it minimizes the maximum modulus. # Conclusion: [ boxed{x^2 - frac{1}{2}} ]"},{"instruction":"Given that f(x) is a differentiable function defined on mathbb{R}, and f(x) = f(x) always holds, if f'(x_0) = k neq 0, then f'(x_0) = boxed{text{(A) } k}.","output":"Since f(x) is a differentiable function defined on mathbb{R}, and f(-x) = -f(x) always holds, therefore f(x) is an odd function that is differentiable. therefore (f(-x))' = -f'(-x) = -f'(x), therefore f'(-x) = f'(x), therefore f'(x) is an even function. Furthermore, because f'(-x_0) = k (k neq 0), therefore f'(x_0) = k. Hence, the correct answer is: boxed{text{A}}. From the problem, we can deduce that f(x) is an odd function that is differentiable. By differentiating (f(-x))', we determine that f'(x) is an even function, thus solving the problem.

Determine the slope of line MF. A: ±frac{sqrt{3}}{3} B: ±frac{3}{4} C: ±1 D: ±sqrt{3}","output":"The focus of the parabola is located at Fleft( frac{p}{2}, 0 right) and the equation of the directrix is x = -frac{p}{2}. Since the distance from point M to the focus F is equal to 2p, it follows that the distance from M to the directrix x = -frac{p}{2} is also 2p.  Therefore, the x-coordinate of M is x_M = frac{3p}{2}. Substituting this into the parabola equation yields two possible values for the y-coordinate of M: y_M = ±sqrt{3p^2}. Now we can find the slope k_{MF} of the line MF using the coordinates of points M and F:  k_{MF} = frac{y_M}{x_M - frac{p}{2}} = frac{±sqrt{3p^2}}{frac{3p}{2} - frac{p}{2}} = frac{±sqrt{3p^2}}{p} = ±sqrt{3}.  Thus, the correct answer is boxed{D}. In this problem, we utilized properties of a parabola, specifically relating the focus and directrix, to determine the x-coordinate of point M.
