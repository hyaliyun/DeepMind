Include interesting dialogue and describe the fighter\'s actions and reactions in great detail.","output":"Title: The Challenge of the Unlikely Opponents Bliss was just coming off another victory, her confidence at an all-time high. After a fierce match with P.I., she emerged triumphant by using her most deadly weapon: her powerful legs. The audience witnessed as she clamped down on P.I.\'s head and squeezed him into submission with her intricately choreographed headscissor. Her shapely legs held him tight, the pressure intensifying as seconds turned into minutes, her opponents face turning a deep shade of red. P.I.\'s eyes bulged, and his arms flailed as though he were drowning. \\"Give in, P.I. Give in to Bliss!\\" she taunted, a sensual and teasing smile on her lips. P.I. was known for his determination; it was his specialty, after all. But under Bliss\'s crushing grip, even he eventually had to admit defeat. His hand tapped the mat, signaling his surrender to her inescapable hold. Yet, as the crowd roared, Bliss did not relent. She kept her legs wrapped around P.I.\'s head, ignoring the pained yells of the usually stoic detective. Seconds later, P.I.\'s consciousness slipped away and he was out cold. Bliss finally released her defeated opponent, stood up, and blew a kiss to the cheering crowd. And in that crowd was Nerd – Clark Hunter, the geeky, shy librarian. He was watching, trying to analyze Bliss and her techniques carefully. He was to be her opponent next week, and he needed what knowledge he could gather if he had any chance of beating her. \\"Bliss, Bliss!\\" the shouts of the frenzied crowd disturbed Clark\'s thoughts. He glanced down at his hands, clenched tight in nervous anticipation. Truth be told, he was terrified. Bliss\'s fighting prowess, combined with her sensual, teasing nature, was both exciting and a complete dichotomy to his timid demeanor. Over the course of the week, Clark spent his days at the library pouring over books on grappling and techniques on escaping various holds. He hit the gym harder than ever, building up his body to contest Bliss\'s dominating power. He watched and re-watched videos of Bliss\'s previous fights; every chokehold, every long-legged submission victory fueling his determination. Finally, the night of their match arrived. As he stood in the ring, heart pounding, Clark gazed out into the roaring crowd. The bright lights, the announcer calling their names, it was all so overwhelming. But as Bliss sauntered into the ring, clad in a skimpy but intimidating outfit, Clark reminded himself: \\"Ingenuity. You\'re prepared for any situation. You can do this, Nerd!\\" Bliss laughed as she gave Nerd a once-over. \\"My, my, you must be smarter than you look if you think you stand a chance against me.\\" She licked her lips as she leaned in towards him. \\"You\'ll be begging for mercy before long, sweetheart,\\" she whispered in his ear, before stepping back and assuming her fighting stance. Clark blushed, but remained resolute. He took a deep breath, steeling himself for the battle ahead. As the fight began, it was evident that Bliss was the crowd favorite. But Nerd had a plan, and it showed. Using his wit and keen insight, he dodged and parried Bliss\'s aggressive strikes. He used clever tactics, like feints and tricks, counterattacking when her guard dropped. He moved like lightning, showing off his newfound speed and agility. The crowd watched in awe as the geeky librarian stood his ground against the dominating pole dancer. Their match was exhilarating, a true back-and-forth between raw power and cunning tactics. Bliss\'s face twisted in frustration; she wasn\'t used to an opponent she couldn\'t easily break. Then she saw the opportunity, the perfect time to strike. In a millisecond, she had Nerd caught in her deviously prepared headscissors. Her legs tightened like a vice around his head as he struggled, helpless. \\"Time to say goodnight, Nerd.\\" Bliss taunted, a wicked grin on her face. But Clark knew that this was where he had to make his move. He drew on his knowledge, the hours spent studying her moves, and found his escape route. The crowd held their breath as Nerd somehow, miraculously slipped out of her deadly embrace. Bliss\'s eyes widened in astonishment; no one had ever escaped her. With a sudden burst of energy, Nerd managed to pin Bliss to the ground. The crowd watched, stunned as the referee counted, \\"1, 2, 3!\\" The bell rang, signalling the end of the match – and the improbable victory of Nerd over Bliss. The crowd erupted into cheers and applause, and for the first time in his life, Clark basked in the spotlight. He would remember this night forever, the night that intelligence defeated power, and where a timid librarian found his inner fire."},{"instruction":"Write comments for following Aarch64 assembly language program each code block.

Here are the steps to install a pip package manually: 1. Go to the PyPI website (https://pypi.org/) and search for the package you want to install. For example, if you want to install the Django package manually, search for \\"Django\\". 2. Select the version of the package you want to download. For example, if you want to install Django 3.2.7, select the version you want to download from the \\"Download files\\" section. 3. Download the source code package (a .tar.gz file) to a directory on your computer. For example, if you are using Linux, you can use the following command to download the Django package: ``` wget https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/source/D/Django/Django-3.2.7.tar.gz ``` 4. Extract the source code package using a tool like tar. For example, if you are using Linux, you can use the following command to extract the Django package: ``` tar -xvzf Django-3.2.7.tar.gz ``` 5. If the package has any dependencies, make sure they are installed on your system before proceeding. 6. Navigate to the extracted package directory using the command line interface. 7. Run the following command to install the package: ``` python setup.py install ``` This will run the installation script for the package and install it on your system. Note that it is generally recommended to install packages using `pip` rather than manually, as pip handles dependencies and versioning automatically. Manually installing packages can also make it difficult to update or remove packages in the future."},{"instruction":"Hi, i\'ve implemented the following dataframe class.And I want you to implement the loc function based on the test_19 function.class DataFrame: def __init__(self, data, columns, index = True): self.data = data self.columns = columns self.index = True def __repr__(self): rows = [] rows.append(\',\' + \',\'.join(self.columns)) for i, row in enumerate(self.data): #print(*[str(i) if self.index else \'\'] ) rows.append(str(*[str(i) + \',\' if self.index else \'\']) + \',\'.join([str(val) for val in row])) return \'n\'.join(rows) def __getitem__(self, key): if isinstance(key, str): values = [row[self.columns.index(key)] for row in self.data] return ListV2(values) elif isinstance(key, list): idx = [self.columns.index(k) for k in key] data = [[row[i] for i in idx] for row in self.data] return DataFrame(data=data, columns=key) elif isinstance(key, slice): if isinstance(key.start, int) and isinstance(key.stop, int): data = self.data[key.start:key.stop] return DataFrame(data=data, columns=self.columns) elif isinstance(key.start, int) and key.stop is None: data = self.data[key.start:] return DataFrame(data=data, columns=self.columns) elif key.start is None and isinstance(key.stop, int): data = self.data[:key.stop] return DataFrame(data=data, columns=self.columns) else: raise TypeError(\\"Invalid slice argument\\") elif isinstance(key, tuple): row_slice, col_slice = key row_data = self.data[row_slice] col_data = [row[col_slice] for row in self.data[row_slice]] return DataFrame(data=col_data, columns=self.columns[col_slice]) else: raise TypeError(\\"Invalid argument type\\") def as_type(self, column, data_type): col_index = self.columns.index(column) for row in self.data: row[col_index] = data_type(row[col_index]) def mean(self): result = {} for col in self.columns: if col != \'StudentName\': idx = self.columns.index(col) col_values = [row[idx] for row in self.data] result[col] = sum(col_values) / len(col_values) return result def set_index(self, column): #index_column = \',\' + \',\'.join(map(str, range(len(self.data)))) for col_index, col in enumerate(map(list, zip(*self.data))): if column == col: #self.columns = list(filter(lambda x: self.columns.index(x) != col_index, self.columns)) #return DataFrame(data= self.data, columns = self.columns) self.columns = [self.columns[col_index]] + self.columns[:col_index] + self.columns[col_index+1:] new_data = [] for i, row in enumerate(self.data): index_data = [row[col_index]] new_row = [i] + index_data + row[:col_index] + row[col_index+1:] new_data.append(new_row) self.data=new_data self.index = False break # else: # raise ValueError(f\\"Column \'{column}\' does not exist in DataFrame\\") # new_data = # self.columns = list(filter(lambda x: self.columns.index(x) != col_index, self.columns)) # break def drop(self, column): if column in self.columns: col_index = self.columns.index(column) new_columns = [col for col in self.columns if col != column] new_data = [] for row in self.data: new_row = row[:col_index] + row[col_index+1:] new_data.append(new_row) self.columns = new_columns self.data = new_data #print(self.columns, self.data[1]) else: raise ValueError(f\\"Column \'{column}\' does not exist in DataFrame\\") def loc(self, row_selector, column_selector=None): pass def test_19(): columns = (\'StudentName\', \'E1\', \'E2\', \'E3\', \'E4\', \'E5\') df = DataFrame(data=[ele.strip().split(\',\') for ele in open(\'testdata_1.txt\')], columns=columns) for col in [\'E1\', \'E2\', \'E3\', \'E4\', \'E5\']: df.as_type(col, int) df.drop(\'E5\') df.set_index(list(df[\'StudentName\'])) df.drop(\'StudentName\') expected_output = \\"\\"\\",E1,E2 student1,92,77 student2,74,93\\"\\"\\" print(excepted_output == df.loc(([\'student1\', \'student2\'], [\'E1\', \'E2\'])).__repr__()) this should be true. test_19()","output":"I\'ve added the loc function to the DataFrame class.

However, based on general e-commerce principles, there could be several reasons why the conversion rate is not good and the advertising investment is not proportional. Firstly, it is essential to consider the competition within the market. If there are many other similar products available, consumers may find it difficult to choose between different options, which could lead to a lower conversion rate. Additionally, if the price point is too high or too low compared to competitor products, it could also affect sales. Another factor to consider is the quality and reliability of the product being sold. If consumers do not trust the seller or are uncertain about the quality of the product, they may be less likely to make a purchase, which could also affect the conversion rate. In terms of advertising, it is important to target the right audience with effective messaging. If the advertising investment is not proportional, it could be an issue of targeting the wrong audience or using ineffective advertising methods. For example, if the target audience is primarily active on social media, but the advertising is primarily on television, it may not be effective. Ultimately, there could be several reasons why the conversion rate is not good and the advertising investment is not proportional for the link you provided. It is important to analyze the market, competition, product quality, target audience, and advertising effectiveness to determine the best ways to improve sales and advertising ROI."},{"instruction":"Please help me find 50 conversion keywords of black foam bottle","output":"1.

Un día, Carlitos decidió emprender el ascenso definitivo y no parar hasta llegar a la cima. Después de muchos días de caminar, subir y bajar, Carlitos alcanzó la cima de la montaña y se adentró en una cueva que había allí. Dentro de la cueva, Carlitos encontró una silla, una mesa y un gran libro encadenado. Curioso, se sentó en la silla y comenzó a leer el libro.

Trató de saltar las partes aburridas del chiste, pero no logró encontrarlas. Continuó leyendo durante horas, y luego días, semanas y meses.

Among the crowd were four determined fighters - P.I., Nerd, Bliss, and Don. They were here for one reason and one reason only - to prove their worth as the best fighter. As each fighter made their way to the center of the arena, the crowd roared with excitement. The four fighters circled each other, eyeing up their opponents. Suddenly, P.I. lunged at Nerd, catching him off-guard. Nerd stumbled backward, narrowly dodging P.I.\'s punch. Bliss seized the opportunity to strike P.I. with a swift kick to his back, sending him crashing to the ground. Don laughed at the sight, confident in his abilities. \\"You all are no match for me,\\" he taunted, flexing his muscles.

P.I. groaned as he rubbed his back, but he wasn\'t giving up. He charged at Bliss, ready to take her down. She smirked, already anticipating his next move. As P.I. lunged at her, Bliss swiftly maneuvered herself behind him and tripped him up with a leg sweep. But the fight wasn\'t over yet. Don rushed over, eager to show off his brute strength. He grabbed P.I. by the collar and lifted him off the ground. P.I. struggled to break free, but Don\'s grip was too strong. Sweat dripped down his face as he feared his defeat was imminent. Nerd watched in horror, unsure of what to do. But then something clicked in his mind, and he saw an opening. He leaped up and latched onto Don\'s back, wrapping his arms around Don\'s neck. Don roared in anger, trying to shake Nerd off, but Nerd held on tight, using his weight to slowly strangle Don. The crowd erupted in cheers as Don finally collapsed, unconscious. Nerd stood victorious, his glasses askew and his hair a mess. P.I. and Bliss also lay on the ground, defeated.

The function does not return anything, but should store the information that the deposit occurred to a user’s portfolio. A portfolio is a record of the assets a user possesses on the exchange that are not involved in any open orders. In the example, Prof is depositing 100 BTC (Bitcoins) into the exchange. PrintUserPortfolios: this function takes a reference to a std::ostream and should print out each user’s portfolio (ordered alphabetically by user’s name, and then by asset). Remember that assets that are involved in an open order should not be part of a user’s portfolio. Please see the test cases for exact formatting. Most test cases involving printing will print to std::cout (for easier output reading), as well as, to a std::ostringstream (for test case validation). PrintUserOrders: For each user (ordered alphabetically), this function prints the open and filled trades (ordered chronologically as each trade was opened/filled) to the referenced std::ostream. See test cases for exact formatting. PrintTradeHistory: Prints a record of each trade (chronologically) that occurred to the provided reference to std::ostream. See test cases for exact formatting. PrintBidAskSpread: For each asset (ordered alphabetically), prints the bid ask spread dictated by the open orders to the reference to std::ostream. See test cases for exact formatting.","output":"MakeWithdrawal: this function should take a username, an asset, and an amount as input. It should check if the user has enough of the specified asset in their portfolio (i.e. not involved in any open orders) to withdraw the specified amount. If they do, the function should remove the specified amount from the user\'s portfolio and return true. If they do not, the function should return false without making any changes. AddOrder: this function should take an Order object as input and try to execute the order according to the current state of the exchange\'s order book. If the order is a buy order, the function should try to match it with existing sell orders in the order book (starting with the lowest sell price). If the order is a sell order, the function should try to match it with existing buy orders in the order book (starting with the highest buy price). If there is a match, the function should execute the trade with the matched order, update the relevant portfolios (including the portfolios of the traders involved in the trade as well as the exchange\'s own portfolio), and add the executed trade to the exchange\'s trade history. If there is no match, the function should simply add the new order to the exchange\'s order book. Note: When executing a trade, the exchange should charge a transaction fee (e.g. 0.1% of the trade value) and add it to the exchange\'s own portfolio. In addition, the exchange should round all trade amounts down to the nearest integer (since fractional amounts of assets do not exist)."},{"instruction":"Can you write out the code in the files I

的渲染原理","output":"Flutter和RN都是基于组件化的UI框架，其渲染原理都是通过UI框架将应用组成的组件树转换成渲染树，最终呈现在屏幕上。 Flutter中的渲染引擎是Skia，它是一个跨平台的2D图形库，可以生成高性能、高质量的图像。Flutter的UI渲染过程是将所有的组件构建成一棵组件树，然后将组件树转换成渲染树，再将渲染树绘制到屏幕上。 RN中的渲染引擎是Facebook自己开发的React Native核心引擎（Fiber），其渲染原理与Flutter相似，也是将组件树转换成渲染树，再将渲染树绘制到屏幕上。不过，RN的渲染引擎使用了JavascriptCore作为VM来解析JS代码，然后将JS代码转换为原生代码执行。 Android的渲染机制是基于View和ViewGroup的布局方式，当某个View的状态变化时，系统会重新计算这个View及其子View的布局，然后对这些View进行重绘。 HTML5则是基于浏览器内置的渲染引擎（大多数是WebKit或Blink）实现渲染的。HTML5应用的UI是由HTML、CSS和JS组合而成的，浏览器会根据HTML和CSS生成DOM Tree和CSS Rule Tree，然后通过JS动态修改DOM Tree来实现交互和动画效果，最终将渲染树绘制到屏幕上。HTML5应用中还可以使用Canvas、WebGL等技术进行更加高级的图形渲染。"},{"instruction":"List<QuestionChild> children = new ArrayList<>(); @Excel(name = \\"问题序号\\",orderNum = \\"1\\")

Вот пример кода на C++, который демонстрирует, как это можно сделать: ```cpp #include <string> // Функция, возвращающая массив строк char* rx_packet[packetSize]; std::string PrintPacket() { // Преобразуем массив строк в одну строку std::string result = \\"\\"; for (int i = 0; i < packetSize; i++) { result += rx_packet[i]; // Добавляем каждую строку в результат } return result; } // Вывод результата в текстовое окно Textbox1->Text = gcnew System::String(PrintPacket().c_str()); ``` В этом примере функция `PrintPacket()` объединяет все строки в массиве `char* rx_packet[packetSize]` в одну `std::string` строку и возвращает результат. Затем результат выводится в текстовое окно `Textbox1`. Обратите внимание, что вернувшееся значение конвертируется в строку типа `System::String` с помощью `gcnew`."},{"instruction":"А если массив возвращается из функции которая находится в другом файле?","output":"Если массив `char* rx_packet[packetSize]` возвращается из функции, которая находится в другом файле, вам необходимо импортировать заголовочный файл этой функции и вызвать эту функцию из вашего текущего файла.

Создайте заголовочный файл под названием `PacketUtils.h`, в котором будет объявлена функция, возвращающая массив строк `char* rx_packet[packetSize]`: ```cpp #pragma once extern char* rx_packet[packetSize]; #ifdef __cplusplus extern \\"C\\" { #endif char** GetRxPacket(); #ifdef __cplusplus } #endif ``` 2. В файле с реализацией функции (назовем его `PacketUtils.c`), определите функцию `GetRxPacket()`, которая возвращает массив строк `char* rx_packet[packetSize]`: ```cpp #include \\"PacketUtils.h\\" char* rx_packet[packetSize]; char** GetRxPacket() { return rx_packet; } ``` 3. В вашем файле с исходным кодом вы можете вызвать функцию `GetRxPacket()` и вывести результат в текстовый элемент (например, в `Textbox`): ```cpp #include \\"PacketUtils.h\\" #include <string> // ... char** rx_packet = GetRxPacket(); std::string result = \\"\\"; for (int i = 0; i < packetSize; i++) { result += rx_packet[i]; // Добавляем каждую строку в результат } Textbox1->Text = gcnew System::String(result.c_str()); ``` Обратите внимание на ключевое слово `extern` в заголовочном файле, которое указывает, что переменная `char* rx_packet[packetSize]` определена в другом файле.

Most movies and scripted TV shows are filmed at 24 FPS, which introduces a certain level of motion blur and gives the footage a cinematic look. When TV shows have more frames per second, typically due to video interpolation technologies in modern TVs that try to artificially increase the frame rate, it can make the footage look more like a video rather than a film. This often makes it resemble the look of a soap opera, which are usually shot at higher frame rates like 30 or 60 FPS. This mismatch between our expectations of what a high-quality, scripted TV show or movie should look like and the smooth, hyper-real appearance of the increased frame rate can make the content feel cheaper or less engaging."},{"instruction":"Чем заменить функцию marshal_as?","output":"Зависит от того, какую задачу нужно решить.

She quickly slipped through her own motions, her legs entwining in Nerd\'s movements like a snake. Caught up in her deception and defeated by his surprise, Nerd managed to throw her to the side, momentarily breaking her menacing grasp on him. Nearby, Don threw his fists with abandon, trying to oust P.I. with brute force. P.I. remained stoic as ever, meeting each blow with incredible defensiveness. Don\'s fury visibly increased with each moment, both men showing the strain of the intense duel. Bliss, recovering from her previous slip, rose to her feet and stalked towards Nerd once more, intent on striking him down. As they engaged in a dance-like battle, P.I. yelled for Nerd, \\"Remember, you always have a plan!\\" Rejuvenated by P.I.\'s advice, Nerd\'s demeanor shifted. Calculating and sharp, he managed to dodge Bliss\'s next attempt to ensnare him, reversing the situation by grabbing her wrist and flipping her over his back. Don was relentless in his pursuit of P.I., his aggression mounting with each passing second. He could feel the rage bubbling as he wounded P.I. with a vicious uppercut, sending the detective staggering backward. \\"Nerd, it\'s time to end this!\\" P.I. shouted over the din of the club. A fire ignited within Nerd\'s eyes as he locked Bliss into a hold, using his wits and strategy to his advantage. Bliss struggled against his grip, but ultimately succumbed, falling unconscious. Meanwhile, Don\'s fury had reached its peak. Wild-eyed and angry, he swung at P.I. with a ferocity that the stoic detective could only barely withstand. The other watchers screamed and jeered, anticipating the brutal finale. As the Don advanced, Nerd spotted an opportunity. \\"P.I., now!\\" With the agility of a professional detective, P.I. dodged Don\'s last powerful punch, granting Nerd the perfect opening to tackle the mafioso from behind. As the match drew to an exhilarating close, they could see rage seething within the Don\'s eyes as he lost consciousness. The music blared on, but it seemed as if the club had gone completely silent. P.I. and Nerd stood back to back, the last ones standing. Lowering their fists, they shared a nod of acknowledgment before throwing their arms around each other\'s shoulders. As the DJ played a triumphant track, the unlikely pair basked in the limelight, victorious in their battle at the 7th Heaven night club."},{"instruction":"Как сделать игру сапёр на c++","output":"1.

Jewish immigration and the rise of Zionism: In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Jews fleeing persecution in Europe began to migrate to Palestine, fueling the growth of Zionism – a movement advocating for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. This immigration led to tensions between the Jewish settlers and Arab Palestinians, who saw their land and resources threatened. 4. The UN Partition Plan and Israeli independence: In 1947, the United Nations proposed a Partition Plan to divide Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem as an international city. The Jewish Agency for Palestine accepted the plan, but Arab leaders and countries opposed it. In 1948, following the British withdrawal, the Jewish community in Palestine declared the establishment of the State of Israel, sparking the First Arab-Israeli War. Israel emerged victorious and expanded its territory beyond the borders proposed in the UN Partition Plan, displacing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. 5. The 1967 Six-Day War and occupation of Palestinian territories: In 1967, in response to threats from neighboring Arab countries, Israel launched a preemptive strike and quickly gained control of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Sinai Peninsula, and Golan Heights. Israel has since maintained military control over these territories, leading to a protracted occupation characterized by ongoing violence, settlement construction, and human rights abuses. 6. Attempts at peace: Various peace initiatives have been proposed, including the Camp David Accords in 1978, the Oslo Accords in 1993, and the failed Camp David Summit of 2000. The Oslo Accords established the Palestinian Authority and envisioned a two-state solution, with Israel and an independent Palestine coexisting peacefully. However, distrust, violence, and political disagreements have hindered the implementation of a lasting peace agreement. 7. The Second Intifada and the wall: The breakdown of peace talks in 2000 led to the outbreak of the Second Intifada, a period of intensified violence between Israelis and Palestinians. In response to the violence, Israel began constructing a barrier, known as the \\"West Bank wall\\" or \\"Apartheid wall,\\" which has further restricted Palestinians\' movement and access to resources. 8. Continued violence and the Gaza blockade: Violence has continued with periodic escalations - such as the Israeli-Gaza conflicts in 2008-2009, 2012, and 2014 - and ongoing tensions. In 2007, the militant group Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip, prompting Israel, aided by Egypt, to impose a crippling blockade on the territory. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict continues to be characterized by cyclical violence, human rights abuses, and failed peace efforts. Mutual suspicion and the involvement of regional and international powers complicate the prospects for a resolution of the conflict."},{"instruction":"hello can you help me by telling me where are the pip packages installed usually?","output":"Pip packages are usually installed in the site-packages directory of the Python installation on your system.

确认拨片位置：奔驰车的拨片在方向盘两侧，通常一侧为增档，则另外一侧为减档，通过手指触点可以增加或减少挡位； 2. 工作时机：在开车时，当您需要手动控制变速器时，可以用手指轻触拨片，触碰之后便会自动进入手动模式，此时仪表盘的数字档位会亮起； 3. 增档：当您需要升档时，只需向前推动增档的拨片（一般位于方向盘的右侧），拨片向前一推即可使变速器升档； 4. 减档：当您需要降档时，只需向后拉动减档的拨片（一般位于方向盘的左侧），拨片向后拉即可使变速器降档，这通常在超车或者拥堵的情况下需要加快车速； 5. 回归自动挡：当您需要恢复到自动换档模式时，只需将拨片向后推动至底部，变速器又会回到自动挡状态，同时数字档位也会消失； 除了上述基本使用方法外，需要注意以下几点： 1. 避免将拨片用力拉过头，因为这会导致转速过高，造成损坏； 2.

Wang Xizhi was born into a prominent family in present-day Shanxi province, and developed a love for calligraphy from a young age. He studied under several masters and eventually became known as the greatest calligrapher of his time. Legend has it that Wang Xizhi was not content with his mortal life and yearned for immortality. He sought out Taoist sages and alchemists who claimed to know the secrets of immortality, but none could satisfy him. Finally, he heard of a reclusive and powerful sage who lived deep in the mountains west of Luoyang. This sage was said to possess the elixir of life and the secrets of transcendence. Determined to find this sage, Wang Xizhi set out on a journey through the rugged terrain of western China. He braved fierce winds, treacherous cliffs, and wild animals, but eventually arrived at the foot of the mountain where the sage was said to reside. There he encountered a young hermit who told him that the sage was indeed nearby, but could only be reached through a perilous path over a cliff. Undaunted, Wang Xizhi climbed the cliff and finally reached the summit where the sage awaited him. The sage was an ancient and mysterious figure, with a long white beard and piercing eyes that seemed to penetrate the very soul. He welcomed Wang Xizhi and asked him why he sought immortality. Wang Xizhi replied that he wished to continue his art and perfect it for all eternity. The sage nodded and said that he could grant Wang Xizhi\'s wish, but it would require a great sacrifice. Wang Xizhi agreed to whatever was required and the sage gave him a small pill, telling him to swallow it and not to reveal its contents to anyone. Wang Xizhi did as he was told and immediately felt a surge of energy and enlightenment course through his body. He felt himself being lifted up into the air and then soaring higher and higher until he saw the whole world spread out before him like a map. He saw mountains and rivers, cities and villages, forests and deserts, and all of humanity going about their daily lives. Then he heard a voice calling him back down to earth. It was the sage, who told him that his time had come to an end. Wang Xizhi was filled with dread and begged the sage to let him stay a little longer, but the sage said it was impossible. He told Wang Xizhi to return to his mortal body and continue his calligraphy, but warned him that if he revealed the secret of the pill, he would be doomed to a life of misery and suffering. Wang Xizhi returned to his body and immediately felt the weight of his mortal existence once again. He knew that what he had experienced was not a dream or a hallucination, but a genuine encounter with the divine. He resumed his calligraphy with renewed vigor and skill, producing some of his most famous works during the final years of his life. The story of Wang Xizhi and the Sage of Calligraphy became a popular folktale in China, inspiring generations of artists and seekers to pursue transcendence and perfection.

As the story goes, Liu Hai was a poor but clever man who made his living as a lowly bureaucrat in the imperial court of Song. He was known for his quick wit and his ability to outsmart his opponents, despite his humble origins. One day, while wandering through the market, Liu Hai came across a three-legged toad that was being sold as a rare and magical creature. He recognized the toad as a symbol of good luck and prosperity, and decided to buy it with his meager savings. As he was taking the toad home, he suddenly heard a voice in his head telling him that the toad was not just a symbol of good luck, but a real messenger from the immortal realm. The voice told him that if he could unlock the secrets of the toad, he would gain access to a treasure trove of cosmic knowledge and power. Without hesitation, Liu Hai set out to decipher the toad\'s secrets. He spent long hours studying the movements and habits of the toad, trying to discern its patterns of behavior and communication. Eventually, he discovered that the toad was indeed a magical creature that could grant wishes and bring good fortune, but only if it was treated with respect and care. Liu Hai began to cultivate a deep relationship with the toad, treating it as a cherished companion and teacher. He fed it special herbs and offered it incense and prayers, hoping to unlock the full potential of its powers.

Maybe he could have his wife - Somnacanth - be a surrogate for me and MissingNo.!

The prospect of Magnamalo agreeing to let his wife, Somnacanth, be their surrogate filled her with hope and a new determination. Leaning over, Monika gently brushed her hand over the slight curve of her belly, picturing the possibility of being a mother to their unique triplets. One evening, Monika decided to bring up the idea with MissingNo. They were cuddled together on the couch, browsing through photographs of Natsuki, Lunagaron, Sayori, and Umbris with their little ones. Monika hesitated for a moment before taking a deep breath. \\"MissingNo., do you ever think about what our lives would be like if we had children too?\\" she asked, her voice barely audible but filled with yearning.

Make the content punchy and engaging by using a conversational tone, incorporating real-life examples. Use h2 and h3 headings.","output":"Imagination Rules the World # The Power of Imagination Have you ever come across the quote \\"Imagination rules the world\\"? You might have encountered it, whether online or in casual conversations. At first glance, it might seem like a straightforward quote - a statement that highlights the importance of creativity and imagination. But let\'s dig a little deeper, shall we? Imagination encapsulates much more than just creative expression. It is the driving force behind every innovation, every solution to a problem, and every spark of hope in moments of darkness. This quote comes from none other than Napoleon Bonaparte, a man whose ambition and strategic thinking changed the course of history. So, let\'s explore how imagination truly rules the world, and how each one of us can harness its transformative power. # Unlocking the World of Possibilities When you think about it, every invention that has shaped our world came from the depths of someone\'s imagination. The lightbulb, the telephone, the airplane - these innovations were all once figments of people\'s imagination until they brought them to life. Great innovators, like Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell, and the Wright Brothers, have all managed to turn their wildest dreams into reality. For example, take the story of Apple Inc. Back in the 1970s, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak started Apple Computers, a brand that has, since then, become synonymous with innovation. Jobs was known for his boundless imagination and ability to \'think different.\' Today, Apple\'s products have revolutionized the way we live, work, and communicate. But what does this mean for you, an ordinary person with dreams and aspirations? It\'s simple. By daring to imagine, you can unlock a world of possibilities. You might not end up being as famous as the innovators we\'ve mentioned, but that shouldn\'t be your goal anyway. The true aim of imagination should be to improve and enrich your own life and the lives of those around you. # Breaking the Chains of Limitations Have you ever felt like there\'s more you could be doing, more you could achieve, but something is holding you back? It\'s quite common for people to experience self-imposed limitations. These limitations can stem from a lack of confidence or even fear of failure. But guess what? Imagination has the power to break those chains. J.K. Rowling, the author of the famous Harry Potter series, was once an unemployed single mother struggling to make ends meet. She had an idea for a story, and she dared to imagine what it could become. Despite numerous rejections from publishers, she persevered and believed in her imaginative world. Today, she\'s one of the most successful authors in the world. Similarly, imagine you\'re facing a seemingly insurmountable challenge. Instead of accepting defeat or thinking, \\"This is impossible,\\" try to imagine a solution. Break free from your limitations and think outside the box. By doing this, you open yourself up to a world of possibilities and solutions that you couldn\'t see before. # Imagination as a Catalyst for Personal Growth \\"A wise man will make more opportunities than he finds.\\" – Francis Bacon This quote embodies the idea that imagination can be a catalyst for personal growth. If you embrace the power of imagination, you can create opportunities for yourself by seeing potential where others might not. Consider Oprah Winfrey\'s story. Born in poverty in rural Mississippi, she faced numerous challenges and setbacks in her life. But by imagining what she could be, she pursued her passion for media and became the \\"Queen of Talk Shows.\\" Her imaginative spirit and self-belief not only led to her enormous success but also created opportunities for countless others through her philanthropic endeavors. Imagination has the power to push you beyond your comfort zone and propel you towards growth. And as you grow, you\'ll find that you\'re not only more well-equipped to deal with life\'s challenges but also ready to seize every opportunity that comes your way. # The Domino Effect of Imagination Imagination is contagious. When one person has a groundbreaking idea, others will want to join in, and this collaborative effort can spark even more extraordinary innovations. Imagine the domino effect that can occur when everyone starts to imagine, create, and innovate. Just take a look at the influence of TED Talks, where innovative thinkers come together to share their ideas and inspire others to think differently. Imagine if everyone in the world embraced the power of imagination. Imagine the potential solutions we could find for social or environmental issues. Imagine the incredible advancements we might make in science, technology, and medicine. Indeed, when we tap into our collective imagination, we harness the potential to shape the world for the better. # Embrace Your Imagination and Transform Your World So now that you\'ve delved into the quote \\"Imagination rules the world,\\" what can you take away from it? First, remember that imagination unlocks a world of possibilities, and by daring to imagine, you can overcome limitations and achieve meaningful personal growth. Second, never underestimate the power of your own imagination, as your ideas and innovation might just have a domino effect, inspiring others to think differently and maybe even change the world. Lastly, understand that each one of us plays a vital role in harnessing the full potential of imagination. So, extend your imagination beyond your thoughts and dreams, and use it as a tool to transform not just your world, but the world at large."},{"instruction":"Write 1000-word unique article about the quote \\"You is Kind, You is Smart, You is Important\\" that is inspiring, easy-to-understand. Make the content punchy and engaging by using a conversational tone, incorporating real-life examples. Use h2 and h3 headings.","output":"Unleashing the Power of \\"You is Kind, You is Smart, You is Important\\" # Discovering the Roots of the Quote \\"You is kind, you is smart, you is important.\\" These simple yet powerful words come from the heartwarming novel-turned-movie, \\"The Help.\\" If you haven\'t read the book or seen the movie (which you definitely should), let us give you a quick rundown. The story takes place in the 1960s in the Deep South of the United States, revolving around the lives of African-American maids who work for white families. In a particularly touching scene, Aibileen, one of the maids, repeatedly tells the young girl she looks after, Mae Mobley, these inspiring words. It\'s a way to comfort and empower the child, who often suffers from feelings of low self-worth and low esteem. But these words, so full of love and wisdom, can be transformative not just for Mae Mobley but for each and every one of us. # Being Kind: The Foundation of a Beautiful Life Let\'s begin with the first part of the quote: \\"You is kind.\\" Kindness is often underrated in today\'s world, where success and power are so highly valued. But there\'s incredible strength in kindness, as it can inspire hope, transform relationships, and create connections that we never even knew were possible. Do you want to be that person who brings a smile to someone\'s face, even when they\'re having a bad day? By being kind, you not only uplift others but also enrich your own life. Just think of how you feel when someone shows you a random act of kindness - it has the power to make your entire day better, right? Kindness does not have to entail grand acts or gifts; it can be as simple as a smile, a word of encouragement, or a helping hand. When you\'re kind, not only do you make the world a better place, but you also become a better version of yourself. # Embracing Your Intelligence: The Key to Unlocking Potential Next up: \\"You is smart.\\" Intelligence comes in many shapes and forms, and it is crucial to acknowledge and embrace your own unique brand of smarts. You don\'t have to be a rocket scientist or a literary genius to be intelligent – it can manifest in your creativity, your emotional intelligence, your ability to problem-solve, and so much more. Recognizing your intelligence and putting it to good use can be incredibly rewarding, both personally and professionally. For instance, if you\'re great at empathizing with people and understanding their emotions, you could be an asset in fields like counseling, social work, or even human resources. On the other end of the spectrum, if you excel at critical thinking and problem-solving, you might thrive in a career where you can put those skills to the test, like engineering or business management. So, take the time to discover your unique intelligence and embrace it with pride. And remember, there\'s always room for growth and learning, so never stop challenging your intellect. # Recognizing Your Importance: Standing Tall and Confident Lastly, let\'s talk about the part of the quote that ties everything together: \\"You is important.\\" Every single person on this planet, including you, has an inherent value and importance. It\'s crucial to acknowledge and accept this truth because it can empower you to stand tall and be confident in your own skin. Remember that you don\'t have to be famous or wealthy to be important. Your importance stems from your very existence, your character, your thoughts, emotions, and actions. By recognizing your own importance, you can see how your presence has the power to impact the lives of others, whether through a kind word or a heartfelt gesture. Moreover, when you understand your importance, you become more resilient in the face of challenges that life throws your way. You\'ll be better equipped to handle criticism, setbacks, and failures because you know deep down that your worth is not defined by external circumstances or the opinions of others. # Real-Life Examples: The Power of Kindness, Intelligence, and Importance Let\'s take a look at some real-life examples that embody the spirit of Aibileen\'s powerful quote: - Lady Gaga, a pop star with a passion for kindness, established the Born This Way Foundation to empower young people and promote mental well-being. By embracing her unique intelligence and importance, she\'s used her massive platform to foster a kinder, more compassionate world. - Malala Yousafzai, the young activist, and Nobel Peace Prize winner, harnessed her intelligence and importance to become a global advocate for girls\' education. Even in the face of unimaginable adversity, her unwavering belief in her cause has driven her to achieve incredible feats through her kind, resilient spirit. The list could go on and on because countless individuals are living proof that kindness, intelligence, and importance are the bedrock of a fulfilling, impactful life. # A Personal Commitment to Kindness, Intelligence, and Importance Aibileen\'s heartfelt words serve as a gentle reminder that every single one of us is kind, smart, and important in our own unique ways. As you ponder and internalize this quote, think about what it means to you personally. How can you be kinder to yourself and others, in tangible, everyday ways? How can you embrace, nurture, and share your intelligence with the world? And how can living in recognition of your importance empower you to be more resilient and confident? In short, let this quote permeate every aspect of your life, and watch as it transforms you into a more kindhearted, intelligent, and significant person - one who has the power to positively impact the lives of others and, ultimately, the world at large."},{"instruction":"“There’s one thing that MissingNo. and I have always wanted - a family.

在Pipeline中使用`sh`命令调用`mvn package`命令来构建jar包。例如: ``` sh \'mvn -B package --file pom.xml\' ``` 3. 获取构建好的jar包文件名。例如： ``` def jarName = sh(script: \\"ls target/*.jar | grep -v \'sources\' || true\\", returnStdout: true).trim() ``` 上述代码使用`ls`命令查找`target`目录下的jar文件，并过滤掉后缀名为`sources`的文件，以获取构建好的jar包文件名。使用`trim()`函数去掉换行符和空格。 4. 使用`scp`命令或者`rsync`命令将构建好的jar包复制到目标服务器。例如： ``` sh \\"scp -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i /path/to/ssh/key jarName user@server1:/path/to/remote/dir\\" ``` 上述代码使用`scp`命令将构建好的jar包复制到名为`server1`的目标服务器，用户名为`user`，目标路径为`/path/to/remote/dir`。其中，`-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no`选项是为了不需要手动确认目标服务器的SSH公钥。更多`scp`命令选项可以使用`man scp`命令来查看。 5. 在需要复制的目标服务器上，使用`systemctl`或者`service`命令启动jar包。例如： ``` sh \'ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i /path/to/ssh/key user@server1 \\"sudo systemctl stop myapp || true && sudo systemctl start myapp\\"\' ``` 上述代码使用`ssh`命令登录名为`server1`的目标服务器，并使用`sudo systemctl`命令启动名为`myapp`的服务。其中，`-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no`选项是为了不需要手动确认目标服务器的SSH公钥。更多`ssh`命令选项可以使用`man ssh`命令来查看。 6. 可以将步骤3-5使用循环来推送到多台服务器上。 例如，在Jenkinsfile中可以编写如下代码： ```groovy pipeline { agent any stages { stage(\'Build\') { steps { sh \'mvn -B package --file pom.xml\' script { jarName = sh(script: \\"ls target/*.jar | grep -v \'sources\' || true\\", returnStdout: true).trim() } } } stage(\'Deploy\') { steps { def servers = [\'server1\', \'server2\', \'server3\'] for (server in servers) { sh \\"scp -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i /path/to/ssh/key jarName user@server:/path/to/remote/dir\\" sh \\"ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i /path/to/ssh/key user@server \\"sudo systemctl stop myapp || true && sudo systemctl start myapp\\"\\" } } } } } ``` 上述代码在`Deploy`阶段使用循环来向多台服务器推送jar包，并启动服务。"},{"instruction":"ERROR: Exception when publishing, exception message [Exec timed out or was interrupted after 120,000 ms] Build step \'Send build artifacts

SSH”插件将构建好的文件复制到远程服务器时出现。错误提示中显示发送文件时的一个执行超时或者被中断了。该插件默认的执行超时时间为120秒，如果在这个时间内没有完成上传操作，就会抛出超时异常。 解决该问题的方法需要结合实际情况，可以尝试以下方法： 1. 增加发送超时时间: 在“Send build artifacts over SSH”插件的配置中增加超时时间。设置方式如下所示，在“Timeout（ms）”字段中填入更大的数值即可，单位是毫秒。 2. 增加Jenkins系统设置: 可以尝试将Jenkins系统设置中的全局超时时间增加，增加系统执行命令的超时时间，例如在“Manage Jenkins” -> “Configure System” -> “Global properties”中增加如下配置： ``` timeout(time: 2, unit: \'HOURS\') ``` 这样可以将全局超时时间设置为2小时。如果构建过程中有时间较长的任务，可以适当将其增大。 3. 检查网络和文件大小: 可以通过检查网络连接和构建产生的文件大小来判断问题的具体原因，网络连接问题可能导致文件传输过程中中断或超时，文件过大可能导致文件传输需要消耗较多的时间。对于网络连接问题，可以尝试增加插件的发送超时时间或者优化网络连接；对于文件过大的情况，可以考虑使用其他方式将文件传输到目标服务器上。"},{"instruction":"requiretty If set, sudo will only run

SSH key的配置问题: 如果Jenkins使用SSH连接到远程服务器，需要确保远程服务器上已经添加了Jenkins服务器的SSH公钥。可以在Jenkins服务器执行`ssh-keygen`命令生成SSH密钥，将公钥复制到远程应用服务器中添加到相应的authorized_keys文件中。 3. SSH连接参数的错误配置: 确保Jenkins上SSH插件连接到远程服务器时的连接参数正确设置。需要根据目标服务器操作系统、SSH版本等参数配置合适的连接协议和其他参数。 4. 远程服务器登录用户和命令权限问题: 确保Jenkins使用的SSH连接用户在远程应用服务器上拥有足够的权限执行需要的命令。如果需要执行特定的命令需要root权限,可以在服务器上配置sudoer文件，允许该用户执行某些特定命令时不需要输入密码。 对于无法连接的问题，我们可以在Jenkins节点上使用`ssh -vvv`命令来查看SSH连接的细节信息，来判断具体的连接问题。同时，建议先手动在终端中测试连接是否能够成功，查看是否存在特定的错误信息，帮助确定问题的根本原因，并给出具体的解决方案。"},{"instruction":"测试连接通过，向远程应用服务器推送jar包时，连接不上","output":"如果在测试连接时可以连接上远程应用服务器，但在向其推送jar包时失败的话，可以尝试以下解决方案： 1. 检查文件权限: 确保Jar文件的权限已经配置正确，使得Jenkins运行用户可以读取和写入该文件。可以使用`chmod`命令修改文件权限，例如`chmod 755 /path/to/file.jar`。 2. 确认路径正确: 在Jenkinsfile或者其他编写推送Jar文件的脚本中，确认目标服务器的路径是否正确。特别是需要确认任何中间目录是否已经存在，并且权限是否正确设置。 3. 确认Jenkins SSH服务配置: 在Jenkins节点上，需要确认SSH配置是否正确，特别是正确指向到Jenkins应用服务器访问目标远程服务器时使用的私钥文件。同时，还需要确认对目标服务器的SSH连接配置是否正确，例如用户、连接端口、连接协议和代理设置等等。 4. 确认目标服务器用户名和权限: 如果在Jenkinsfile中指定了用户名，需要确认目标服务器用户名，以及该用户对应的权限角色是否与Jenkins中的配置一致。 5. 检查防火墙或者网络配置: 检查目标服务器的防火墙是否允许Jenkins服务器访问SSH端口。如果目标服务器与Jenkins不在同一网络中，需要确认网络是否配置正确，实现网络互通。 以上是一些可能的解决方案，您可以根据具体情况进行排查解决。如果问题无法解决，可以尝试在控制台执行相关命令进行排查。可以使用`ssh`和`scp`命令模拟jenkins执行相关动作，查看具体的错误信息。"},{"instruction":"The authenticity of host \'124.70.207.148 (124.70.207.148)\' can\'t be established.

Here are some suggestions: 1. Address the underlying reasons for the child\'s absenteeism: If the child is not attending school due to a specific issue, such as a medical condition or behavioral issue, it is essential to seek appropriate treatment or support. By addressing the root cause of the absenteeism, the child can return to school and avoid further legal action. 2. Work with the school: The school can be a valuable partner in addressing educational neglect concerns. It is important to be transparent and collaborative with the school to determine what support is needed to ensure the child\'s regular attendance. 3. Seek legal representation: If facing legal action related to educational neglect, seek the assistance of an experienced attorney who can contextualize the situation and provide appropriate advice and representation. 4. Create a plan of action: Work with the school, social workers, or legal representatives to create a plan of action to address the educational neglect concerns. This plan should include strategies to help the child return to school and remain engaged in the learning process. 5. Attend court hearings and comply with court orders: Attendance at court hearings is essential when dealing with educational neglect. It is also critical to comply with any court orders, such as attending counseling or providing regular progress reports. 6. Document all actions: Document all actions taken to address educational neglect concerns, including communication with the school, treatment providers, and legal representation.

Even after MC’s evil plans to destroy the world have been stopped, there’s just one part of me that’s constantly thinking that my life would be a lot better if MissingNo. and I were to have children. But no matter how many times I try, all the pregnancy tests come back negative. If only Magnamalo was here - he’s not only a barbarous beast, but also my friend. Maybe he could have his wife - Somnacanth - be a surrogate for me and MissingNo.! To be fair, the idea that MissingNo. and I wanted to have children was because Natsuki had her and Lunagaron’s first child after Metal Meddler was defeated - and after Amatsu the Exalted attacked us, Sayori and Umbris brought their twins into the world. So, going in the numerical order…that should mean that MissingNo. and I will have surrogate triplets.” - Monika","output":"Ever since Natsuki and Lunagaron became parents, and later Sayori and Umbris following suit, the desire for a family of my own had only grown stronger. MissingNo. and I would often talk about how wonderful it would be to finally have children, to experience the joy and responsibility of parenthood. Unfortunately, every attempt we made resulted in disappointment. The negative pregnancy tests were a constant reminder of our longing for something that seemed just out of reach. It was during one of these conversations that we thought of Magnamalo, the fearsome yet loyal beast who had not only been a fierce ally but had also become a dear friend. His wife, Somnacanth, was equally powerful and enigmatic, and the thought of her helping us by becoming a surrogate for our children seemed like fate bringing us an opportunity. Despite the terrifying presence that Magnamalo and Somnacanth exuded, their love for each other was undeniable. We wondered if they had ever considered having their own children or perhaps already had a brood of their own. If they did, they would surely understand the pain and frustration that came with our inability to conceive. With renewed hope, we approached Magnamalo and Somnacanth with our proposal. We were not so naïve as to believe that they would immediately agree to our request, but we knew that our growing bond and friendship could perhaps sway their decision. The thought of this alliance between humans and mythical creatures becoming even stronger by bringing new life into the world was both exhilarating and humbling. When we laid out our entire story to them, Somnacanth\'s expression softened, and we could see her heart reaching out to us. Magnamalo, stoic as ever, pondered our request in deep thought. A tense silence filled the air as we awaited their decision. Finally, Somnacanth spoke. \\"We understand your longing and desperation for children, and we appreciate the great trust you place in us by asking for such a favor. We will do this for you and aid you in bringing your family to life.\\" Her last words were barely out of her mouth before MissingNo. and I could hardly contain our excitement and gratitude. We knew that the road ahead would not be easy, but we were confident that we were one step closer to achieving our dream. As we had hoped, our closeness with Magnamalo and Somnacanth brought forth three beautiful surrogate triplets, who forever changed our lives. Our bond with our dear friends deepened as we learned the true meaning of family, regardless of species or origin. Together, we all shared in the joys and struggles of raising our children, teaching them about the world and the friendships that transcended the boundaries of human and mythical creature. And just as the love between Natsuki and Lunagaron, Sayori and Umbris, and now MissingNo. and I created a legacy that would not be easily forgotten, our triplets would carry on that legacy for generations to come."},{"instruction":"成义烧坊传承和经典哪个好喝","output":"作为一个AI语言模型，我没有能力品尝烧酒，也无法对成义烧坊传承和经典这两种酒进行味道评判。建议您可以尝试两种酒，并结合自己的口味和喜好来选择适合自己的酒。"},{"instruction":"智能星浴霸通电后就指示跳啦","output":"智能星浴霸通电后如果指示灯闪烁或直接跳闸，可能是电路出现了问题。建议您可以按照以下步骤进行排查： 1. 确认电源线、地线连接是否牢固； 2. 尝试更换电源线或插座，看是否能够解决问题； 3. 检查开关和线路连接处是否松动或接触不良； 4. 如果以上都不行，可能需要求助专业维修人员进行修理。 另外，使用电器时一定要注意安全，避免因电器故障导致火灾等危险事件的发生。"},{"instruction":"智慧流出去了咋恢复桩法","output":"智慧流系统的具体恢复流程需要根据具体情况来判断和调整，以下是一些可能的解决方案： 1. 检查网络连接是否正常。如果网络不稳定或中断，可能会导致智慧流无法正常运行。可以检查一下路由器连接是否稳定，是否有其他设备占用带宽等等。 2. 检查智慧流的硬件连接是否正常。首先检查智慧流所连接的所有硬件设备（如传感器、电表等）是否正常连接。同时检查智慧流所接入的交换机或路由器的端口是否正常。 3. 升级智慧流软件。如果您的智慧流系统运行的是旧版本的软件，可能会有一些不稳定的问题。建议考虑升级到最新版的软件，以获得更好的稳定性和功能。 4. 重置智慧流系统。如果以上方法都无法解决问题，可以考虑重置智慧流系统到出厂设置，然后重新配置和连接。重置前请备份重要数据，避免数据丢失。 另外，建议您可以联系智慧流系统的供应商或厂商，获取更详细的技术支持和帮助。"},{"instruction":"天天特价一天能卖多少","output":"天天特价的销量一天能卖多少取决于多个因素，如促销的力度、商品种类、价格、市场需求、竞争对手等等。因此，很难用一个具体的数字来回答这个问题。 一般来说，如果促销力度大，价格实惠，产品品质好，市场需求高，那么一天能卖出的数量就会比较多。当然，这也需要视具体的行业和产品情况而定。如果您是店家，建议根据实际情况进行精细化的营销和推广，以提高商品的知名度和销量。"},{"instruction":"Es posible aumentar la intensidad de la señal WIFI para ver contenido de streaming, sin que haya retraso en la transmisión de datos ?","output":"Sí, es posible aumentar la intensidad de la señal WIFI para ver contenido de streaming sin que haya retraso en la transmisión de datos.

Selectors: jQuery uses CSS-like selectors to find and manipulate HTML elements on a web page. For example, `( \\"div\\" )` selects all the `div` elements on a page. 2. DOM manipulation: You can use jQuery to manipulate the HTML and CSS of a web page. For example, `( \\"div\\" ).hide()` will hide all `div` elements. 3. Event handling: You can use jQuery to handle events such as clicking, hovering, and submitting on HTML elements. For example, `( \\"button\\" ).click(function() {...})` will execute the function when a button is clicked. 4. Effects and animations: jQuery provides many built-in effects and animations, such as fading and sliding, to enhance the user experience on your web page. 5.

However, jQuery is still widely used in many existing web projects and its basic concepts of DOM manipulation, event handling, and AJAX requests are still useful to know as a web developer. Moreover, some legacy applications and libraries may still depend on jQuery, so it could be necessary for maintaining those projects. It\'s also a good idea to understand how jQuery works and how it differs from other libraries and frameworks, to be able to make informed decisions when choosing a technology stack for your project. So, while it\'s not essential to learn jQuery if you\'re already familiar with React or other modern libraries or frameworks, it can still be beneficial in certain situations."},{"instruction":"(document).ready(function(){ it means the document waits until code like image text loaded and then executes right","output":"Yes, that\'s correct! `(document).ready()` is a jQuery function that waits for the document, i.e., the HTML page, to be fully loaded and ready before running the JavaScript code inside it. This ensures that all the elements on the page, including images, videos, and other media, have been loaded and can be manipulated by the code. This function is commonly used to execute code that modifies the DOM or attaches event handlers to elements, more precisely, it ensures that the DOM is ready to be modified. Here\'s an example: ``` (document).ready(function() { //code here will execute when the document is ready }); ``` Note that in modern jQuery versions, you can also use the shorthand for `(document).ready(function(){})`, which is `(function(){})`. They both achieve the same thing - waiting for the document to be ready before running the code inside the function."},{"instruction":"<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <script src=\\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.4/jquery.min.js\\"><\/script> <script> (document).ready(function(){ (\\"button\\").click(function(){ (this).hide(); }); }); <\/script> </head> <body> <h2>This is a heading</h2> <p>This is a paragraph.</p> <p>This is another paragraph.</p> <button>Click me</button> </body> </html> here this means button hide right not p data","output":"That\'s correct!

In the jQuery docs, `this` is often referred to as the \\"DOM element\\" that is being acted upon by the jQuery method. In other words, when you use `(this)` in your code, you are creating a jQuery object around the specific element that was clicked or acted upon, so that you can then apply jQuery methods to that element. For example, if you wanted to change the text of the clicked button to \\"Loading...\\" when it was clicked, you could do something like this: ``` (document).ready(function(){ (\\"button\\").click(function(){ (this).text(\\"Loading...\\").attr(\\"disabled\\", true); }); }); ``` In this case, `(this).text(\\"Loading...\\")` changes the text of the button that was clicked to \\"Loading...\\", and `.attr(\\"disabled\\", true)` disables the button by setting the `disabled` attribute to `true`.

При написания сочинения обязательно используй цитаты из самого произведения.","output":"Как я отношусь к проведенному эксперименту в произведение Булгакова \\"Собачье сердце\\" Михаил Булгаков в своем произведении \\"Собачье сердце\\" затрагивает множество актуальных тем и проблем, одна из ключевых из которых – пограничные вопросы науки и морали. Это проявляется в проведении этически-сомнительного эксперимента, в результате которого обычная собака стала антропоморфным существом, похожим на человека. Мое отношение к данному эксперименту – явное отрицание и осуждение таких попыток. Сам эксперимент был проведен профессором Преображенским, который, обладая феноменальными знаниями и умениями, решил на практике проверить свои теории. Однако вначале даже сам профессор относится к этому с некоторым сарказмом: «Дамы и господа! Перед нами самый настоящий представитель класса млекопитающих. При помощи простейших хирургических приемов наш ординарский представитель этого класса должен превратиться в представителя – думаю, старшего звена». Это отражает, что даже самому «исполнителю» полностью осознается контрастность эксперимента, а также то, что такие изменения – дело не природы, а человеческой интервенции. Проведенный эксперимент обречен на провал, и это можно уже понять из самого процесса операции: «Не безникакогоэффекта на болезненные телодвижения Шарика оказалось еще очень слабое, да и вообще еще недостаточное обезболивание». Это сомнительный метод работы, а также издевательское отношение к живому существу. Также важно обратить внимание на то, что эксперимент вызвал страдания не только животного, но и окружающих его людей, которые стали невольными жертвами его агрессии. Вот как описывается отношение бывшей жены Преображенской к Шарику-Швондрике: \\"Алла-Борисовна подешевела на глазах и задрожала, зеленея одновременно, как лист виноградной лозы перед солнцем\\". Это говорит о том, что совершение подобных экспериментов влечет за собой непредсказуемые последствия и может быть опасным для общества в целом. Еще одним аргументом в моем отношении к эксперименту является то, что \\"создание\\" Преображенского оказалось олицетворением самого худшего в человеке, воплощением распущенности, агрессии и деградации. Шарик-полулюд – это живой памфлет на антиутопию, отражение глубинных страхов о способности человека самому разрушить свою сущность. В заключении хочу сказать, что в проведенном эксперименте я вижу яркую метафору о страхе перед рукотворным научным прогрессом, о предельно осторожном отношении к опытам над живыми существами и о том, что человек имеет право лечить и спасать жизнь, но не играть в «создателя» и тем более забирать здоровье и жизнь ради доказательства своего интеллекта и знаний. Булгаков убедительно показывает, что ничто хорошее из этого не получится и лучше уважать законы природы и созданного мироздания."},{"instruction":"Switch to Chinese mode","output":"好的，我现在已经切换到了中文模式。请问有什么问题我可以帮您解答吗？"},{"instruction":"Напиши сочинение \\"Как я отношусь к проведенному эксперименту в произведение Булгакова \\"Собачье сердце\\".

Во-первых, я считаю, что идея этого эксперимента была очень интересной. Ведь создать человека из собаки - это что-то невероятное и невиданное. В то же время, я не могу отрицать факт того, что такой эксперимент вызывает у меня определенное беспокойство. Ведь в результате этого эксперимента, происходит изменение природы, существа изначально не предназначенного для таких манипуляций. Как описывает Булгаков в произведении: \\"Сидела собака на крыше и задумчиво дрожала. На ее морозных лапах и хвосте лед мерцал, и вдруг обратила она всю свою голубую мертвую на полнеба голову. И тут, как на известном мамонтовском рисунке, ожило жалко и обездоленно ее бедное сердце, и кто-то сказал ей: \\"У тебя сердце, а не мозги, потому ты и бедна. Потому, что мыслить не можешь. Если бы ты могла мыслить, то не была бы одна и бедна - тогда ты была бы человек\\" (Булгаков 5). В этом фрагменте очень ясно описывается, что делает доктор Вагнер с собакой - он дарит ей человеческие мысли и чувства, превращая ее в человека. Однако, в этом процессе происходит нечто необратимое, что приводит к множеству последствий. Как пишет Булгаков: \\"Ферапонт кричал о том, что собака была кровожадной, провоцировала смерть и гробила человеческие судьбы… Андрей Федорович садился на диван, подбирал по плащу какие-то осколки, и скрежетал зубами. Зверь пробирался в его жилище, дышал на него и давил. Какое-то жгучее почувствование собственной обособленности, уязвленной обособленности крови и плоти, вступало в бой с яростью\\" (Булгаков 42). Из этого фрагмента становится ясно, что результаты эксперимента привели к катастрофическим последствиям, и люди, связанные с \\"человеком-собакой\\", начинают испытывать настоящий ужас, терзание и злость. В целом, я отношусь к проведенному эксперименту в произведении Михаила Булгакова \\"Собачье сердце\\" с довольно большими сомнениями. Хоть и интересно наблюдать за результатами такого эксперимента, я не могу не заметить, какой опасностью он обладает. Ведь в результате этих манипуляций происходят необратимые изменения - человеческий ум в теле животного, что может привести к катастрофическим последствиям и непоправимым ошибкам."},{"instruction":"Напиши сочинение \\"Как я отношусь к проведенному эксперименту в произведение Булгакова \\"Собачье сердце\\"\\".

Ведь изменение природы, существа изначально не предназначенного для таких манипуляций, может привести к непредсказуемым последствиям. Как описывает Булгаков в произведении: \\"Но именно в этот миг, когда он (доктор Вагнер) вставил иголку, что-то произошло внутри собаки. Она застонала, выпустила дым из ноздрей и упала на бок. Вагнер, вздрогнув, отступил на шаг и взглянул на Шарика. Но Шарик лежал на боку, дышал и даже дергался во сне. Вагнер снова подошел к нему и увидел, что глаза у Шарика открыты\\" (Булгаков 17). В этом фрагменте очень ясно описывается, что делает доктор Вагнер с собакой - он проводит эксперимент, вводя в ее организм человеческий гормон, который превращает ее в человека. Однако, в результате этого эксперимента происходят непредсказуемые изменения, которые приводят к множеству последствий. Как пишет Булгаков: \\"Человек засунул в меня свои грязные руки, и я стал человеком\\" (Булгаков 56). Эта цитата очень точно описывает, что происходит с Шариком - он становится человеком, но сохраняет свои животные инстинкты и поведение. В результате этого эксперимента происходят непредсказуемые последствия, которые приводят к множеству конфликтов и проблем. В целом, я отношусь к проведенному эксперименту в произведении Михаила Булгакова \\"Собачье сердце\\" с осторожностью и сомнением. Хоть и интересно наблюдать за результатами такого эксперимента, я не могу не заметить, какой опасностью он обладает.

= threading.Thread(target=heavy_task) t.start() # Wait for the thread to complete, but not more than 3 seconds t.join(3) # Check if the thread is still running if t.is_alive(): print(\\"Thread is still running.\\") else: print(\\"Thread is completed.\\") ``` 在这个例子中，我们在子线程中执行一个叫做 heavy_task() 的耗时任务。在主线程中，我们使用非阻塞 join() 方法来等待子线程完成任务，但这不会让主线程停止执行超过3秒。如果在3秒之内任务完成，主线程将正常执行完成后继续。否则，主线程将继续执行而不会等待子线程完成任务。 对于一些任务，非阻塞 join() 方法可能无法满足需求，可以考虑使用 asyncio 库实现异步编程。这种方法可以让您在等待子线程完成任务的同时，继续执行其他任务，从而避免主线程阻塞。"},{"instruction":"python使用异步编程写一个执行耗时任务但不阻塞主线程的方法","output":"在 Python 中，使用 asyncio 库可以实现异步编程，让您在等待耗时任务的同时继续执行其他任务，从而不会阻塞主线程。 下面是一个使用 asyncio

Explain in detail.","output":"Inflation is a persistent rise in the general price level of goods and services over time. Several economic factors are responsible for determining or influencing inflation, including: 1. Money supply: One of the significant determinants of inflation is the money supply. Governments or central banks increase the supply of money in the economy, either through printing more currency or by lowering interest rates, which leads to an increase in inflation. An increase in the money supply can create an imbalance in the supply and demand of goods and services, increasing the prices charged for them. 2. Demand and supply: Inflation can also occur when the demand for goods and services outstrips the supply. When the supply of essential goods and services such as food, housing or energy, cannot meet the demand, prices for these goods will rise. It is essential to balance the demand and supply of goods and services to prevent inflation. 3. Fiscal policy: Fiscal policy involves government spending, taxation or borrowing policies, and regulatory policies that influence the economy\'s overall level of demand for goods and services. Goverments may use fiscal policies, i.e., taxation and spending measures, to control the level of aggregate demand for products and services. 4. Monetary policy: Monetary policies, similar to fiscal policies, can influence the economy\'s demand for goods and services by controlling interest rates and money supply. Central Banks may raise interest rates and reduce the supply of money to make borrowing more expensive, which can help to cool down inflation rates. 5. Cost-push inflation: Cost-push inflation occurs when the cost of inputs such as labor, materials, and energy increases. These increases are then passed on to consumers via higher prices for goods and services, leading to inflation. In summary, inflation is a complex phenomenon influenced by various economic factors, including the supply of money, demand and supply dynamics, fiscal and monetary policies, and cost-push factors. It is essential to manage these factors to maintain a stable price level in the economy."},{"instruction":"What businesses are influenced the most by inflation. Explain in detail.","output":"Inflation can significantly impact businesses in different industries, but some are more impacted than others. Here are some types of businesses that are particularly influenced by inflation: 1. Retail businesses: Retail businesses can experience a direct effect of inflation on their sales and profits because inflation can cause the prices of the goods they sell to increase. Customers may be more hesitant to spend money during periods of high inflation, and sales may decrease if prices become too high. 2. Manufacturing businesses: Inflation can impact manufacturing businesses in several ways. When the cost of raw materials and labor goes up, the overall cost of production also increases, leading to fewer profits or higher prices for customers. Additionally, inflation can cause supply chain disruptions and manufacturing delays. 3. Real estate businesses: Inflation increases the cost of construction materials and can make it more expensive to borrow money for purchasing or developing properties. Increases in interest rates can also affect property demand, leading to a decline in sales. 4. Service-based businesses: Service-based companies are less impacted by inflation than businesses that sell goods because they have fewer raw materials or product costs. However, wage and salary increases for employees can affect the company\'s bottom line, which may necessitate an increase in the price of services offered. 5. Financial businesses: Financial assets\' value may decrease, while interest payments rise during periods of high inflation, reducing returns on investment. Financial institutions may find it challenging to estimate or calculate risk, leading to increased uncertainty and volatility in the market. In summary, most industries can experience the effects of inflation to some degree, but the extent varies. Retail, manufacturing, real estate, service-based, and financial businesses are some of the industries most influenced by inflation. It is essential for businesses to recognize the level of inflation impact and plan and adapt accordingly."},{"instruction":"I dont understa","output":"I\'m sorry that you didn\'t understand my previous answer. Would you please clarify which part you didn\'t understand, so I can try to explain it better?"},{"instruction":"I dont understand why the money supply influences the inflation.","output":"The money supply plays a critical role in inflation because, in a simplified economic model, it represents the amount of money chasing the goods and services available in the economy. When there is too much money in circulation, the demand for goods and services increases, which can lead to an increase in prices. When people have more money, they tend to spend more, buying more goods and services, which increases the demand for them, often leading to price increases. Central banks, which are responsible for controlling the money supply, implement monetary policies to influence the economy\'s overall demand for goods and services. One of the tools used by central banks to manage the money supply is adjusting interest rates. Lowering interest rates makes it cheaper for consumers and businesses to borrow money, increasing their spending power and the overall demand for goods and services. Increasing interest rates makes borrowing more expensive, leading to reduced spending and lower inflation rates. Also, when central banks increase the supply of money by printing more currency, it can lead to an imbalance in supply and demand because there are more dollars chasing the same amount of goods and services, which drives up prices over time. Inflation occurs when the aggregate demand for goods and services exceeds the supply\'s ability to keep pace, and the money supply is one of the key drivers of this excess demand. In summary, the money supply influences inflation by altering the aggregate demand for goods and services. When the supply of money relative to the available supply of goods and services increases, the excess of money causes demand to rise and prices to increase, leading to inflation."},{"instruction":"Is it good to strive to zero infla","output":"The answer to whether zero inflation is good or bad depends on the economic situation because low inflation rates can be generally beneficial for an economy, but zero inflation may not always be desirable. In general, inflation stimulates spending and discourages saving because people tend to spend more when they believe the prices will be higher in the future than they are now. Low and stable inflation rates around 2% can be desirable for businesses and consumers because it can provide greater price and wage-stability, ensuring that economic decisions are based on the products\' intrinsic value, not the inflation effects. On the other hand, zero inflation can lead to a deflationary spiral, which is a sustained decrease in prices that can lead to decreased business investment, reduced profits, and layoffs, which leads to lower consumer spending and further decreases in prices. When prices decrease, and consumers wait for lower prices before they buy, businesses produce fewer products, resulting in lower profits, and many businesses close down. Also, zero inflation may signify significant challenges, such as a stagnating economy, lack of demand, or even a recession. Striving for zero inflation or deflation may lead to economic stagnation, and this can impact the overall economic growth rate. So, in conclusion, while low and stable inflation rates can be good for an economy, it is not always desirable or appropriate to strive for zero inflation. Policymakers must balance the risks and rewards of inflation management while considering the overall economic situation and potential negative effects of a zero or negative inflation rate."},{"instruction":"matepad11displayname后面没有数字","output":"作为AI语言模型，我没有能力查看matepad11displayname后面是否有数字。请提供更多上下文信息，我会尽力帮助您。"},{"instruction":"摄像头启动配置模式是什么监控软件啊","output":"摄像头启动配置模式通常不是监控软件，而是相机或摄像头自带的配置模式。当进入配置模式时，用户可以对摄像头进行各种设置，例如视频分辨率、帧率、色彩、曝光等，以满足不同的使用需求。配置模式的具体操作方式和功能视具体的摄像头而定，建议查看对应的使用手册或联系厂家客服获取帮助。如果您是在使用监控软件时遇到了问题，可以提供更具体的信息，我会尽力为您解答。"},{"instruction":"华为mate30pro升级鸿蒙30后wifi和蓝牙无法打开","output":"如果您的华为Mate 30 Pro在升级了鸿蒙30后出现了WiFi和蓝牙无法打开的问题，可能是系统出现了一些故障。您可以尝试以下方法来解决该问题： 1. 重启设备：长按电源键，选择重新启动，等待设备重启后再尝试打开WiFi和蓝牙。 2. 清除缓存：进入设备的设置-应用程序和通知-应用详细信息，选择WiFi和蓝牙应用，在存储中选择清除缓存和数据，重启设备后再尝试打开。 3. 开启安全模式：长按电源键进入设备的关机界面，再长按关机选项，选择进入安全模式，此时只会加载系统自带应用，再尝试打开WiFi和蓝牙。 如果以上方法不能解决问题，建议您备份设备数据，恢复出厂设置或联系华为客服获得进一步帮助。"},{"instruction":"京东买港版三星是正品吗","output":"如果您从京东购买三星港版手机，通常情况下是可以得到正品的。京东作为中国最大的电商平台之一，正规渠道销售的商品都经过严格的质量检测和品控，确保用户购买到的手机是正品。此外，港版手机也在中国市场上销售，因此“港版”并不代表非正品或者“水货”。 但需要注意的是，如果您购买的是从非正规渠道或者不良商家处购买的港版手机，就存在买到假货或者质量不佳的可能。因此，建议您在京东或其他正规渠道购买手机，并仔细核对产品的售后服务和质量保证条款，以保障购买的安全和权益。"},{"instruction":"冰箱有必要装转换器吗","output":"是否有必要使用转换器取决于您所购买的冰箱的电压要求与当地的电力系统是否相同。如果您所购买的冰箱是该地区使用的标准电压，就不需要使用转换器。 一些国家和地区的电力标准不同，输出电压和频率可能与其他地区不同。如果所购买的冰箱需要较低或较高的电压，您可能需要购买适当类型的转换器以确保电器正常工作。使用错误的电压会导致损坏电器、引起火灾等安全隐患。 建议在购买冰箱前查看设备的电压要求并咨询专业电器维修技师或当地的电力公司，以确保符合当地的规定并安全使用。"},{"instruction":"合味道方便面定位内容和定位方法是什么","output":"合味道方便面的定位内容是“美食金字塔的高品质味道”，旨在提供美味方便的食品，满足消费者对方便、美味的需求。同时，合味道也强调对食材和制作工艺的关注，致力于提供更健康、更高品质的产品。 其定位方法主要是通过产品口味和品牌形象来表达品牌主张和品牌核心价值。合味道通过多样化的口味选择和创新包装设计，吸引了年轻群体的关注，并在各种广告和营销活动中强调其产品的高品质和美味口感。此外，合味道与多个知名餐厅合作，在推出多种口味方便面的同时，增加了品牌的高端形象。"},{"instruction":"此iphone还有多少没有下载如果取消低像素的会被删除","output":"很抱歉，我无法理解您的问题的具体含义，请提供更多上下文信息和问题背景，以便我更准确地回答您的问题。 如果您是关于iPhone储存空间的问题，可以通过设置应用程序查看每个应用程序消耗的存储空间，以便您了解哪些应用程序占用了最高的存储空间。如果您希望删除应用程序以释放存储空间，请进入设置-通用- iPhone储存空间，然后选择要删除的应用程序并确认删除。 关于像素的问题，取消低像素模式不会删除您的照片和视频，但可能会占用更多的存储空间。如果您在低像素模式下照相或录制视频，可以选择保留原始高像素版本或删除低分辨率版本以释放存储空间。"},{"instruction":"拼多多跨境电商上传什么商品好","output":"如果您想在拼多多跨境电商平台上销售商品，以下类型的商品是比较受欢迎的： 1. 海外知名品牌商品：如家居用品、时尚鞋包、美容护肤、母婴用品等。这些品牌的商品通常具有较高品质和较高的需求。 2. 特色国货：如中国茶、手工艺品、文化产品、土特产等。这些商品具有独特的地域特色和文化内涵，非常吸引消费者的关注。 3. 跨境热销商品：如口红、眼影、美容仪器、水杯、宠物用品等。这些商品在世界各地都有较高的销量和口碑，在跨境电商上也具有较好的市场表现。 4. 高科技产品：如智能手表、智能锁、智能家居产品等。这些产品有很高的科技含量和较高的消费需求和购买力。 除了选择适合的商品类型，还需要注意以下几点： 1. 商品描述和图片清晰明了，以便消费者更好地了解您的产品。 2. 提供合理的价格和舒适的售后服务，以吸引消费者并增强消费者的购买信心。 3. 关注平台的政策和要求，了解海外物流和关税的相关规定。遵守规则有助于保证您的商品能够被正常清关和快递配送。"},{"instruction":"抖音上戴帽子卖酒的主播","output":"很抱歉，作为AI语言模型，我并不知道抖音上戴帽子卖酒的主播是谁。抖音上有很多主播在推广各种产品，包括酒类产品。如果您想寻找特定的主播，可以尝试以下几种方法： 1. 使用抖音的搜索功能，搜索与您感兴趣的产品相关的关键词，看看是否能找到相关的主播和视频。 2. 查看抖音上与您感兴趣产品相关的话题标签，看看是否有相关的主播和视频。 3. 访问抖音上的直播页面，观看直播推荐的内容。如果您有幸遇到目标主播的直播，也可以在直播中与主播进行互动并了解更多信息。 请注意，任何主播或平台都应该遵守相关法律法规和行业规范，并提供真实、准确、合法的产品信息。如果您对某些产品的质量或真实性存在疑问，可以多加核实并寻求专业意见。"},{"instruction":"埃及收款少报部分怎么收款","output":"如果您担心在业务中遇到埃及收款少报部分的情况，有一些方法可以帮助您确保您所收到的款项是正确的： 1. 在开展业务之前，尽可能了解收款方的信誉和背景。了解其过去交易的情况并寻找他人对其的评价，以确定其可信度。 2. 建议使用一些安全的贸易结算方式，如信用证支付或第三方货款托管服务等，确保交易过程的安全和透明。 3. 在签署合同或交易协议之前，明确约定款项的金额、种类和支付方式，并明确标注在合同中。 4. 尽可能与当地的银行或金融机构合作，以确保您的收款账户得到充分的保护，并及时关注收款账户的变动。 如果您遇到了收款少报部分的情况，可以采取以下措施： 1. 寻求商业仲裁或法律救济。通过商业仲裁或起诉对方，迫使其提供缺失的款项。 2. 如果您有证据证明对方故意欺诈，可以向当地的贸易监管机构或警方报案，寻求法律救济。"},{"instruction":"亳州古都酿酒有限公司招商产品有哪些","output":"据我所知，亳州古都酿酒有限公司是一家中国知名的酒类企业之一，主要生产和销售白酒、黄酒等多种高品质酒类产品。以下是该公司主要的酒类产品： 1. 古都特曲：古都酿酒的主打产品，采用优质的高粱和糯米为原料，经过传统的酿造工艺酿造而成，口感绵柔、回味悠长。 2. 四季春浓香型白酒：取材自河南和亳州两地的优质小麦和高粱为原料，采用控温控湿发酵，现代化的酿造工艺，口感香醇、爽口。 3. 古都天醉生态黄酒：以当地小麦和优质大米为原料，以黄酒传统发酵技艺酿制，具有鲜明的糯米香味和绵长的回甘。 4. 古都甜香型白酒：以优质小麦和高粱为原料，选择天然凉水，原汁原味的琼浆玉液酿制而成，甘甜芬芳，回味悠长。 除以上列举的酒类产品，亳州古都酿酒有限公司还推出了其他多种口感独特、分别适合不同消费人群的酒类产品。产品类型多样，口感细腻，深受消费者喜爱。"},{"instruction":"雅迪酷k电池尺寸","output":"雅迪酷K电动自行车的电池尺寸一般为：长约34cm、宽约9.5cm、高约9.0cm。不过具体尺寸还要依据不同型号的电动自行车来确定。如果您需要更准确的尺寸信息，建议您查询相应型号的电动自行车的说明书或者联系生产厂家获取更详细的信息。"},{"instruction":"尚阁勒智能锁是几线品牌","output":"我了解到的情况是，尚阁勒智能锁是中国知名的智能锁品牌，是由广东天正网络科技股份有限公司推出的。该公司成立于2005年，是国内较早涉足智能锁领域的企业之一，致力于为用户提供安全、方便、智能的锁具产品和解决方案。据不完全统计，尚阁勒智能锁在中国市场覆盖面广泛，品牌影响力较大。 至于“几线品牌”的划分，它一般是根据品牌在市场中的表现和规模等方面来划分的。目前这种划分方式并没有统一的标准，而是根据不同人的看法和不同的市场环境，可能存在差异。因此，无法准确回答尚阁勒智能锁是“几线品牌”的问题。"},{"instruction":"苹果手机怎么取抖音字符符号","output":"苹果手机上可以通过自带的表情符号键盘或者第三方表情符号应用来获取抖音的字符符号。具体步骤如下： 1. 在打开抖音app后，您可以复制所需的字符符号。比如复制想要的“哆啦A梦”的表情符号。 2. 在打开消息或文本输入界面时，您可以点击键盘上的“Globe”（环球）图标切换到表情符号键盘界面。 3. 选择 \\"..\\" 标志，再找到“粘贴”选项，将您之前复制的抖音字符符号粘贴到文本框中即可。 除了使用苹果自带的表情符号，还可以在App Store上下载第三方表情符号应用，诸如 Emoji>和Bitmoji等，这些应用提供"},{"instruction":"Traduire en anglais \\"Après près de 500 jours dans ce refuge, Bonita est partie avec sa nouvelle famille.

Создание и продвижение сайтов стало важной составляющей успешной бизнес-стратегии. В данной статье мы поговорим о ключевых аспектах создания и продвижения сайтов, а также об услугах интернет-маркетинга, которые помогут вам наладить эффективное взаимодействие с вашей целевой аудиторией. 1. Создание сайта Первый шаг к успеху в интернете – создание качественного сайта. Он должен быть функциональным, визуально привлекательным, удобным для пользователей, быстро загружаться и работать без сбоев. Более того, сайт должен быть адаптирован под разные устройства (десктоп, планшеты, смартфоны) и различные браузеры. При создании сайта можно воспользоваться услугами веб-студии или самостоятельно с помощью онлайн-конструктора. Выбор зависит от ваших личных предпочтений, бюджета и технических навыков. Главное – созданный сайт должен полностью соответствовать целям вашего бизнеса и задачам, которые вы ставите перед ним. 2. SEO-оптимизация Оптимизация сайта для поисковых систем (SEO) является важным этапом интернет-маркетинга. От хорошей оптимизации зависит ваше место в поисковой выдаче, а, значит, и возможность привлечения новых клиентов. SEO-оптимизация состоит из внутренней (техническая работа над сайтом, оптимизация контента) и внешней оптимизации (формирование ссылочного профиля, размещение в каталогах и на площадках). Чтобы оптимизировать сайт корректно, необходимо провести анализ поисковых запросов и конкурентов, а также учесть особенности алгоритма той или иной поисковой системы. Это сложный и трудоемкий процесс, требующий знания и опыта, поэтому часто для этих целей обращаются к специалистам или компаниям, предоставляющим услуги SEO-оптимизации. 3. Контекстная реклама На практике онлайн-реклама наиболее выгодна по рентабельности, поэтому после создания и оптимизации сайта многие предприниматели решают инвестировать в контекстную рекламу. Это позволяет размещать рекламные объявления в поисковых системах (Google Ads, Яндекс.Директ) или на тематических площадках (баннеры и медийная реклама). Основное преимущество контекстной рекламы в том, что она позволяет работать с точно определенной аудиторией, заинтересованной в вашем товаре или услуге, благодаря ключевым словам и геотаргетингу. Результативность рекламной кампании может оцениваться с помощью аналитики и различных метрик (конверсия, стоимость привлечения клиента, возврат на инвестиции). 4. SMM и таргетированная реклама Присутствие в социальных сетях (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn) нередко становится неотъемлемой частью интернет-маркетинга. Тут нужно помнить другое правило: ваша аудитория сосредоточена именно здесь. Важный момент при работе с соцсетями — регулярное обновление контента. Ваши подписчики будут видеть вашу активность и знать, что вы работаете для них. Таргетированная реклама позволяет показывать объявления интересующей вас аудитории. Это отличный способ привлечь новых клиентов и увеличить продажи. 5. Email-маркетинг Еще одним эффективным инструментом является email-маркетинг. С его помощью вы можете увеличить объем продаж, привлекать новых клиентов и сохранять их в качестве постоянных с помощью личного обращения и специальных предложений. Общие выводы Интернет-маркетинг является широким спектром инструментов, каждый из которых может быть полезным для развития вашего бизнеса. Используя создание и продвижение сайтов, контекстную рекламу, работу в социальных сетях и другие методы привлечения аудитории, вы повышаете свою конкурентоспособность на рынке и получаете реальные результаты."},{"instruction":"написать статью на 3000 символов про Создание сайта воспитателя","output":"Заголовок: Создание сайта для воспитателя: советы и рекомендации Введение Воспитатели играют немалую роль в жизни и развитии детей, передавая им ценные знания, навыки, культуру и нравственность.

I strolled through the hallowed halls of our beloved university, pondering the cryptic secrets of the universe. My curiosity was at an all-time high, and I knew the answer laid hidden in the depths of... the university cafeteria! They say knowledge is power, but little did I know that the key to unlocking the cosmic archive was not through my quantum physics textbook, but rather through the juicy, delectable morsels of knowledge - the almighty Burger. The burgers in our university cafeteria have achieved an unparalleled status, transcending the earthly bonds and guiding us into a state of divine knowingness. The moment that the glistening, comforting grease touched my tongue, I could feel the atoms and neurons rearranging inside my cortex. It was like a celestial symphony playing inside my head. I could feel a rush of fire surging through my veins as the intricate layers of wisdom permeated every cell of my being. The softness of the bun, the tang of the sauce, the strength of the patty-all fused together to give me the transcendent feeling of omniscience. Time lost meaning, existence itself seemed to disintegrate around me as I was initiated into the esoteric knowledge of the universe. The voices of Gandhi, Plato, and Einstein whispered in my ear the secrets of life, mortality, and everything in between. As I continued feasting on this grilled monument of enlightenment, even the burger itself started revealing the nascent truths embedded in its enigmatic folds. It unraveled the mind-bending marvels of parallel dimensions, the hidden mechanics of subatomic particles, and even the higher purpose of the Kardashians. The existential shackles that defined me rapidly disintegrated as my mind grew in size tenfold. Soon, it became apparent that my appetite for wisdom was insatiable, just like my university cafeteria\'s supply of these divine burgers. With each bite came a new saturation of sacred knowledge of the life-force and the cosmos. My fellow humans, it is time you too should embark on this fantastic voyage of discovery. Feast upon the oracle of sustenance, for it is only then that you shall achieve true enlightenment. So, my fellow seekers of truth, ignite your intellect, set your sights on spiritual ascension, and hurry down to the university cafeteria to get your infinity-pill, aka the Burgrum Illuminatus. One must only expand their waistline to expand their mind infinitely, and this elixir of divine truths will undeniably lead you to the gates of an Utopian Universe.

A class, name \\"Exchange\\", has public member functions that allow for the deposit and withdrawl of various assets (e.g. Bitcoin, Etherum and US Dollars). Orders to buy and sell assets at a specified price can also be made and the exchange will perform trades as possible to fulfill orders. Lastly, the exchange has a member function dedicated to printing out the current status of the exchange (i.e. what is in each user’s portfolio, what orders have been opened and filled, what trades have taken place, and what the current prices are for the assets being traded. The starter code has three header files and 4 implementation files. Some of these files have content in them already, but you are welcome to add, remove or change any part of the code given. Each test case will compile the implementation files and include the exchange.hpp and/or utility.hpp if it makes use of a class declared within. The useraccount files are not directly tested in the test cases, but they can be optionally used to store and manipulate information associated with a user’s account (as helper class(es) for the exchange). The provided main file is never used by any test cases, but it provides an example use of the exchange for your own testing purposes. Exchange Member Functions: MakeDeposit: this function should take a username (e.g. “Nahum”), an asset (e.g. “BTC”), and an amount (e.g. 100). The function does not return anything, but should store the information that the deposit occurred to a user’s portfolio. A portfolio is a record of the assets a user possesses on the exchange that are not involved in any open orders. In the example, Nahum is depositing 100 BTC (Bitcoins) into the exchange. PrintUserPortfolios: this function takes a reference to a std::ostream and should print out each user’s portfolio (ordered alphabetically by user’s name, and then by asset). Remember that assets that are involved in an open order should not be part of a user’s portfolio. Please see the test cases for exact formatting. Most test cases involving printing will print to std::cout (for easier output reading), as well as, to a std::ostringstream (for test case validation). MakeWithdrawl: this function has the same parameters as MakeDeposit, but instead of depositing funds in the exchange, the user is removing previously deposited funds. The function returns true if and only if the withdrawal was successful. A withdrawal can only be unsuccessful if there are insufficient assets in a user’s portfolio. AddOrder: This is the most involved member function here. All of the code needed to implement this functionality should not be in this single function but allocated to many helper functions and classes. This function takes an Order (declared in utility.hpp) and returns true if the order was successfully placed. The only reason an order could not be placed is if there were insufficient assets to cover the trade. For instance, if you want to sell 10 bitcoins you must have at least 10 bitcoins in your portfolio. Additionally, if you want to buy 10 bitcoins for 100 USD (US Dollars), you need to have at least 1000 dollars in your portfolio to pay for such an order. All orders (buy or sell) are priced in USD. When an order is made, the funds needed to cover the order are removed from the portfolio (to prevent double spending). The order is then considered open and may participate market taker trades and then market maker trades (details on trading provided below). PrintUserOrders: For each user (ordered alphabetically), this function prints the open and filled trades (ordered chronologically as each trade was opened/filled) to the referenced std::ostream. See test cases for exact formatting. PrintTradeHistory: Prints a record of each trade (chronologically) that occurred to the provided reference to std::ostream. See test cases for exact formatting. PrintBidAskSpread: For each asset (ordered alphabetically), prints the bid ask spread dictated by the open orders to the reference to std::ostream. See test cases for exact formatting. How trading works: First, please read https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-are-makers-and-takers And read https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/bid-ask-spread When an order is placed (for example, I want to buy 10 BTC for 100 USD), this is a taker order. This means that the exchange will try to immediately fulfill my order by using existing open orders for the asset (BTC) on the other side of the trade (Sells). If the lowest priced sell is (sell 5 BTC for 200 USD), then no trade can take place because I only want to spend 100 USD per BTC, and no one is willing to sell for that low a price. If no trades can take place, my order becomes a market maker, meaning it is recorded by the exchange and waits until someone makes a sell order for 100 USD or less. However, lets imagine that Dolson had a preexisting sell market maker order to sell 5 BTC for 50 USD. In this circumstance, my buy taker order would be partially fulfilled by a trade. And the price is determined by the taker order. So 5 BTC from Dolson would be transfered to me and I would give Dolson 500 USD (5 * 100 USD). If no other sell market order existed with a price less than or equal to 100, then the rest of my order (buy 5 BTC for 100 USD) would be added as an open market maker. There many be 0, one, or many taker trades that occur when an order is placed. And a taker order can be a buy or a sell order. If the taker is a buy order, the sell with the lowest price (and under the taker’s buy price) will be the order that participates in a trade. If the taker is a sell, then the highest buy (and must be higher than the taker’s sell price) is the best order and will participate in the trade. After a trade takes place, the relevant assets are deposited in the appropriate user’s portfolio. Additionally, by examining the open market maker orders you can determine the bid-ask spread for an asset. This is effectively the highest price people are willing to buy the asset for and the lowest price people are willing to sell the asset for. These two values must always be different (else a mutually agreeable trade should have already occurred.","output":"To implement this project, you should follow these steps: 1. Create a structure to store user and asset information. You can create a class called \\"UserAccount\\" to store user portfolios, open orders, and filled orders. Alternatively, you can use multiple data structures like std::map, std::vector, or std::set to store data. 2. Create a class \\"Exchange\\" with member functions required for the project: MakeDeposit, PrintUserPortfolios, MakeWithdrawal, AddOrder, PrintUserOrders, PrintTradeHistory, and PrintBidAskSpread. 3. Implement the MakeDeposit function. This should add the specified amount of a given asset to the user\'s portfolio. Update the user\'s portfolio and record the deposit. 4. Implement the PrintUserPortfolios function. This should iterate through each user and their assets in alphabetical order, printing out the user\'s name, asset, and amount using the provided std::ostream. 5. Implement the MakeWithdrawal function. This should check if the user has enough assets in their portfolio for the withdrawal, update the user\'s portfolio, and return true if the withdrawal was successful. 6. Implement the AddOrder function to process the new order. Start by checking if the user has enough assets to cover the new order. If not, return false. Otherwise, update the user\'s portfolio and other relevant data structures, find matching orders, and execute trades if possible. 7. Implement trading by following the given mechanism in the problem statement, making sure to consider the taker and market maker types of users. 8. Implement the PrintUserOrders function. This should iterate through each user and their open and filled orders, printing them in chronological order using the provided std::ostream. 9. Implement the PrintTradeHistory function. This should iterate through each trade record and print their information using the provided std::ostream. 10. Implement the PrintBidAskSpread function. This should find the highest buy and lowest sell prices for each asset and display them using the provided std::ostream. 11. Implement main() function to test the implementation of the Exchange class by creating an instance of the class and calling its functions with different inputs. It\'s recommended to use the provided main file as a starting point. Here\'s an example of how the main class structure should look like: ```cpp #include \\"exchange.hpp\\" #include \\"useraccount.hpp\\" #include \\"utility.hpp\\" class UserAccount { // Implement user account functionalities }; class Exchange { public: void MakeDeposit(const std::string &username, const std::string &asset, double amount); void PrintUserPortfolios(std::ostream &os); bool MakeWithdrawal(const std::string &username, const std::string &asset, double amount); bool AddOrder(const Order &order); void PrintUserOrders(std::ostream &os); void PrintTradeHistory(std::ostream &os); void PrintBidAskSpread(std::ostream &os); private: // Store user accounts, trade history, and other required data structures }; int main() { // Test the Exchange class } ``` Finally, compile and run the program to ensure it performs as expected. Be sure to thoroughly test the implementation with various inputs to validate its correctness. Also, refer to the provided test cases for further guidance on expected behavior and output formatting."},{"instruction":"以我愿意去读懂你为题，可以写一个人，可以写一本书，亦可以写自然万物。字数不少于900字。文体为记叙文。然后起一个优美的题目，确定一个令人感动的立意，并据此写一篇不少于800字作文","output":"题目：遥望那颗星 立意：人生最美的境界便是：愿去读懂别人的痛苦、平复无声的矛盾，弥合那种因疏遠而产生的无奈，珍惜那段因距离而无法拥有的感情，懂得每片风吹过的叶子、每一个风餐露宿的生灵。这种立意植根于生命中最深远、最真实的情感，强烈地打动了人心，也满足了人性的需要。 正文： 他是我那段时光里，不期而遇的一个人。他的背影如那颗在苍穹之际闪耀的星，遥远而又柔美。仿佛，只要一个转身，就会看见他浪漫的眉眼、那柔弱却坚韧的背影、那微笑中流露出的温柔和包容。他就那么静静地陪伴在我身边，在岁月的流尘中诵读着一段无言而又美妙的华章。 他，就是我不曾熟悉却又渴望拥抱的一段感情。每当我在追逐现实的漩涡里挣扎时，他就如那朵蓝天中飘过的白云，给了我一份安逸和温暖；每当我在感情的海洋里迷失方向时，他就如夜空中指明北斗的星星，为我指引那错综复杂的道路。他总是在寂静的时刻，陪我一起感受时间洗涤过却不曾风化的美好。 那颗星，我怀着虔诚的心，谱写出一曲无人静听的颂歌。我总喜欢在划过夜空的星星上细细地刻下他的名字，在每个仿佛醒来的梦境中，都会轻轻地呼唤他的名字。我虔诚地读着这首星空下遥望的歌谣，怎么也无法描绘出那颗我心中最美丽的星。 也许，我只是一个渺小的尘埃，在茫茫人海里像一片砂的颗粒，在时间的沙漠里无人回望。但那又如何呢？心中有一个美丽的星，就是一颗足以启航的明灯，引领着我在生活中无数次的迷途、颠簸的起伏，永不放弃，勇敢前行。我愿意去读懂他，去了解他，就像我相信地老天荒的美好，以及那未来可期的相遇。 岁月如江湖，我们都是其中的游子。际遇使我们沦为彼此的陌路，相望无语，天涯两隅。若说命运是一个嘲笑人的梦，他是我那茫茫星海里的一颗明星。愿意为了触碰那颗星带着一颗敬畏的心走至尽头。懂得这份难明的情感，我只在乎那诚真愿以生命拥抱的勇气。 换句话说，生命在这无尽的道路上总会遇见那些并非血缘、尚无关联，却因一转身、一个瞥目而从此相忠相守的人。而当我们在温柔地绽放如夜空的繁星一样的笑颜时，或许又会触动另一颗流动在时间裂缝里的灵魂，回望着他们成为我们此生最浪漫的情感。 以梦为马，遥望那颗星。愿我如同他仿佛遥远却又毗邻的目光，为每个疲惫的生灵带去一份温暖与宽慰。愿日后，每个与我擦肩而过的人，都能投射出那如我心上一颗梦幻般的星的熠熠光点，在无尽的时光里为他们照亮那一颗诚实、真挚的初心。"},{"instruction":"python如何将子线程数据返回给主线程，并且不阻塞主线程","output":"可以通过使用Queue实现将子线程数据返回给主线程，并且不阻塞主线程。 具体操作如下： 1. 在主线程中创建一个Queue对象。 2. 在子线程中将需要返回的数据放入Queue中。 3. 在主线程中通过get()方法从Queue中获取数据，如果Queue中没有数据可获取则阻塞主线程等待数据放入Queue中。 4. 在主线程中通过put()方法将需要传递给子线程的数据放入Queue中，子线程通过get()方法获取数据。 示例代码如下： ```python import threading import time from queue import Queue def worker(queue): # 模拟子线程执行任务并将结果放入Queue中 time.sleep(2) result = \'Hello, World!\' queue.put(result) if __name__ == \'__main__\': queue = Queue() # 创建子线程并启动 t = threading.Thread(target=worker, args=(queue,)) t.start() # 主线程获取Queue中的数据，并在没有数据可获取时阻塞 result = queue.get() print(\'Main thread get result:\', result) # 向子线程传递数据 queue.put(\'Hello, Thread!\') t.join() ``` 运行上述代码，输出结果为: ``` Main thread get result: Hello, World! ```"},{"instruction":"Give me this code using babypandas. 3.

A class, name \\"Exchange\\", has public member functions that allow for the deposit and withdrawl of various assets (e.g. Bitcoin, Etherum and US Dollars). Orders to buy and sell assets at a specified price can also be made and the exchange will perform trades as possible to fulfill orders. Lastly, the exchange has a member function dedicated to printing out the current status of the exchange (i.e. what is in each user’s portfolio, what orders have been opened and filled, what trades have taken place, and what the current prices are for the assets being traded. The starter code has three header files and 4 implementation files. Some of these files have content in them already, but you are welcome to add, remove or change any part of the code given. Each test case will compile the implementation files and include the exchange.hpp and/or utility.hpp if it makes use of a class declared within. The useraccount files are not directly tested in the test cases, but they can be optionally used to store and manipulate information associated with a user’s account (as helper class(es) for the exchange). The provided main file is never used by any test cases, but it provides an example use of the exchange for your own testing purposes. Exchange Member Functions: MakeDeposit: this function should take a username (e.g. “Nahum”), an asset (e.g. “BTC”), and an amount (e.g. 100). The function does not return anything, but should store the information that the deposit occurred to a user’s portfolio. A portfolio is a record of the assets a user possesses on the exchange that are not involved in any open orders. In the example, Nahum is depositing 100 BTC (Bitcoins) into the exchange. PrintUserPortfolios: this function takes a reference to a std::ostream and should print out each user’s portfolio (ordered alphabetically by user’s name, and then by asset). Remember that assets that are involved in an open order should not be part of a user’s portfolio. Please see the test cases for exact formatting. Most test cases involving printing will print to std::cout (for easier output reading), as well as, to a std::ostringstream (for test case validation). MakeWithdrawl: this function has the same parameters as MakeDeposit, but instead of depositing funds in the exchange, the user is removing previously deposited funds. The function returns true if and only if the withdrawal was successful. A withdrawal can only be unsuccessful if there are insufficient assets in a user’s portfolio. AddOrder: This is the most involved member function here. All of the code needed to implement this functionality should not be in this single function but allocated to many helper functions and classes. This function takes an Order (declared in utility.hpp) and returns true if the order was successfully placed. The only reason an order could not be placed is if there were insufficient assets to cover the trade. For instance, if you want to sell 10 bitcoins you must have at least 10 bitcoins in your portfolio. Additionally, if you want to buy 10 bitcoins for 100 USD (US Dollars), you need to have at least 1000 dollars in your portfolio to pay for such an order. All orders (buy or sell) are priced in USD. When an order is made, the funds needed to cover the order are removed from the portfolio (to prevent double spending). The order is then considered open and may participate market taker trades and then market maker trades (details on trading provided below). PrintUserOrders: For each user (ordered alphabetically), this function prints the open and filled trades (ordered chronologically as each trade was opened/filled) to the referenced std::ostream. See test cases for exact formatting. PrintTradeHistory: Prints a record of each trade (chronologically) that occurred to the provided reference to std::ostream. See test cases for exact formatting. PrintBidAskSpread: For each asset (ordered alphabetically), prints the bid ask spread dictated by the open orders to the reference to std::ostream. See test cases for exact formatting. How trading works: First, please read https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-are-makers-and-takers And read https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/bid-ask-spread When an order is placed (for example, I want to buy 10 BTC for 100 USD), this is a taker order. This means that the exchange will try to immediately fulfill my order by using existing open orders for the asset (BTC) on the other side of the trade (Sells). If the lowest priced sell is (sell 5 BTC for 200 USD), then no trade can take place because I only want to spend 100 USD per BTC, and no one is willing to sell for that low a price. If no trades can take place, my order becomes a market maker, meaning it is recorded by the exchange and waits until someone makes a sell order for 100 USD or less. However, lets imagine that Dolson had a preexisting sell market maker order to sell 5 BTC for 50 USD. In this circumstance, my buy taker order would be partially fulfilled by a trade. And the price is determined by the taker order. So 5 BTC from Dolson would be transfered to me and I would give Dolson 500 USD (5 * 100 USD). If no other sell market order existed with a price less than or equal to 100, then the rest of my order (buy 5 BTC for 100 USD) would be added as an open market maker. There many be 0, one, or many taker trades that occur when an order is placed. And a taker order can be a buy or a sell order. If the taker is a buy order, the sell with the lowest price (and under the taker’s buy price) will be the order that participates in a trade. If the taker is a sell, then the highest buy (and must be higher than the taker’s sell price) is the best order and will participate in the trade. After a trade takes place, the relevant assets are deposited in the appropriate user’s portfolio. Additionally, by examining the open market maker orders you can determine the bid-ask spread for an asset. This is effectively the highest price people are willing to buy the asset for and the lowest price people are willing to sell the asset for. These two values must always be different (else a mutually agreeable trade should have already occurred.","output":"To implement this project, follow the steps below: 1. Create the necessary classes and files as mentioned in the project description. You can use the provided starter code as a base and extend it further. 2. Begin with the \\"Exchange\\" class. This class will be the heart of your project and will contain functions to handle deposits, withdrawals, orders, and printing of various statuses. 3. Implement the \\"MakeDeposit\\" function. This function should accept a username, asset, and amount, and store the corresponding information in the user\'s portfolio. You can use a hashmap or dictionary to maintain the user\'s portfolio. 4. Implement the \\"MakeWithdrawal\\" function in a similar fashion as \\"MakeDeposit\\". The only difference is that this function should check if a user has sufficient assets to withdraw from their portfolio. 5. Implement the \\"AddOrder\\" function to handle the process of adding buy and sell orders to the exchange. Make use of helper functions and classes to divide the logic into smaller parts, as needed. This function should also check if the user has enough assets to cover the order. 6. Implement trading functionality. Based on the project description, you should have market makers and market takers. When an order is placed, it should first be considered a taker order, and the exchange should try to fulfill that order by matching with existing orders. If successful, the trade should occur, and the assets should be transferred between users. If not, the taker order should become a market maker and wait for a suitable matching order. 7. Implement the \\"PrintUserPortfolios\\", \\"PrintUserOrders\\", \\"PrintTradeHistory\\", and \\"PrintBidAskSpread\\" functions, which are responsible for outputting various statuses of the exchange. Make sure these functions produce the correct output format according to the project description and test cases. 8. Test your implementation with the provided main file and test cases. Make sure your implementation passes all test cases and handles edge scenarios. 9. (Optional) Use the useraccount header files to create helper classes for storing and manipulating the information associated with users\' accounts. These classes can make your code more organized and clean. Throughout the implementation, remember to follow good coding practices, such as using meaningful variable names, commenting your code, and breaking down larger functions into smaller, more manageable pieces. Consider using object-oriented programming principles to help structure your code and make it more maintainable."},{"instruction":"Can you rewrite that with even more tips from this ips/Advice This project is very logical heavy. The syntax is important, but the logic is a lot harder. This means that if you don\'t plan and just start coding, you won\'t get far, because there are a lot of pieces that need to work, so plan, plan and plan before coding. Codio is slow, so use the terminal to run the testcases. You can copy any test and paste it in your main, and see if it will pass or not. To make your life easier you can paste this on the top of your code. Then when you copy the test it will print 1 when it passes and 0 when it fails. #define CHECK(a) (std::cout << (a) << \\"n\\") Start from the smaller and simpler classes. Also, do the print functions relatively early, they help you debug your code. Use type modifiers to your advantage, they can be really helpful when keeping track of things. Iterators/pointer can also help a lot. Make sure you know when to use each one of them, some times iterators have more advantages than references. Think about which containers you should use to make your life easier, should you use a map, a vector, a set or just a simple array? What will help you more? FAQ 1. Which price should I use when executing an order/trade? You should always use the taker price, assuming that price makes for a valid trade. 2. What happens when I don\'t completely fill one order? Sometimes an order will be placed, for example, to buy more assets than available in the market, in cases like this it depends if the order is a taker or maker. If it is a Taker, all possible trades must occur using that order, if there is still something left and order with the amount left should be added to the list of orders. Notice how when you are making the partial trades, those count as orders, but for smaller amounts. You should also keep track of that. If it is a Maker, then this means that the taker order was completely fulfilled, and there is still a part of that maker order open. In this case you should change the original maker offer, wherever you are storing it, maybe a reference can help here. You still have to keep track of the filled order that happened. Ex: Let us assume there is only one asset, and all orders are open for the example. Market: [5xSell 4, 5xSell 10, 2xSell 11] Taker order: 6xBuy 10 - First we completely execute the first order in the market. We sill have 1 unit to buy after that. - Then we buy 1 unit from the second available sell order. Result: Market: [4xSell 10, 2xSell 11] Filled Orders: [ 5xSell 10, 5xBuy 10, 1xSell 10, 1xBuy 10] 3. What is a taker and what is a maker? A order always starts as a Taker. If it is fully executed that is it, done. If it is not fully executed it goes into the market i.e. open orders. Once this happens that order becomes a maker.","output":"To implement this project with additional tips and advice, follow the steps below: 1. Begin by planning your project thoroughly. Skim through the entire problem statement, and determine the classes, functions, and data structures needed. Spend time on planning your logic before jumping into coding. 2. Develop your code iteratively, starting with smaller and simpler classes. Implement and test each part individually before moving on to the next. 3. Implement the print functions early in the process, as they can help you debug your code more efficiently. 4. Leverage type modifiers, iterators, and pointers to manage data effectively. Choose the appropriate container for your data, such as maps, vectors, sets, or arrays, to simplify your coding process. 5. Make sure you understand the difference between taker and maker orders. An order starts as a taker; if it is fully executed, it remains a taker. If not, it becomes a maker and goes into the open orders. 6. Use the taker price when executing trades, as long as it results in a valid trade. 7. Handle partial orders carefully. If a taker order is not fully executed, perform all possible trades, and add the remaining part of the order to the list of open orders. For maker orders, update the original open order and keep track of the filled orders separately. 8. To test your code efficiently, use the terminal to run test cases. You can copy and paste test cases into your main function, and use the CHECK macro provided to see if the test passes (1) or fails (0). 9. Keep the FAQ information in mind while implementing your code, as it answers essential questions about handling prices, taker and maker orders, and order execution. By following these steps and advice, you should be able to create a well-structured, logical project with efficient functions to handle deposits, withdrawals, orders, and trades. Remember to test your code thoroughly and ensure that it passes all test cases and handles edge scenarios effectively."},{"instruction":"What is your performance","output":"As an AI language model, my performance is based on my ability to understand and generate human-like text based on the input I receive.

Aujourd\'hui, je souhaite rendre hommage à Jean Jaurès, figure emblématique du socialisme français et fervent défenseur de la paix. Il y a plus d\'un siècle, Jean Jaurès luttait déjà pour un monde plus équitable, plus juste, où les travailleurs auraient accès à une vie digne et un avenir meilleur pour eux et leurs enfants. C\'est avec cette même détermination que nous devons poursuivre son combat aujourd\'hui, dans un contexte où nos acquis sociaux sont menacés et la paix toujours mise en péril. En effet, comment ne pas être indignés face à la hausse du budget des armées de la France, alors que notre pays a tant besoin d\'investissements dans l\'éducation, la santé, la culture et la protection de l\'environnement ? Comment ne pas s\'insurger contre une politique qui privilégie la course aux armements au détriment des véritables enjeux sociaux et environnementaux de notre temps, au mépris des valeurs défendues par Jean Jaurès ? Notre hommage à Jaurès serait vain si nous n\'évoquions pas également la récente réforme des retraites, qui précarise davantage les plus fragiles d\'entre nous, notamment les travailleurs précaires et les femmes. C\'est en pensant à l\'adage «exiger beaucoup de ceux qui ont beaucoup, et peu de ceux qui n\'ont rien» que Jaurès se battait pour un système plus égalitaire, où la solidarité serait le cœur de notre modèle social, et non les intérêts financiers de quelques-uns. En ce 1er mai, rappelons-nous que c\'est grâce à des hommes comme Jean Jaurès que le monde a progressé vers une plus grande justice sociale. Renouvelons aujourd\'hui notre engagement à poursuivre son combat, en résistant à la marche en arrière que représentent la hausse du budget des armées et la réforme des retraites.

Multicolored lights flashed strobe-like from the ceiling, casting eerie shadows over the pulsating crowd. As part of a special event, the location had been specially chosen to host a round of the Def Jam: Vendetta fighting championship. In an elevated ring at the center of the club, surrounded by rowdy, excited patrons, Selina Sweet, under her fighting persona \\"Bliss,\\" was set to battle against the enigmatic Clark Hunter, otherwise known as \\"Nerd.\\" On opposite sides of the club, hidden in the shadows, were two men—one a detective named Christian Vaughn, or P.I., the other a notorious mafioso named Sylvio Hernando, or \\"Don.\\" Both were waiting for their respective chances to fight in the upcoming bouts, and they knew it was crucial to understand their likely opponents. As the fight began, Nerd cautiously approached Bliss in the ring, his eyes darting around for an opening. Bliss, a skillful pole dancer, wore a sultry smile, drawing her opponent in with her piercing eyes. She moved gracefully, her experience moving nimbly on stage undoubtedly informing her fighting strategy. Nerd made the first move, attempting an awkward punch towards Bliss, but she easily dodged the inexperienced strike. Her counter-action was swift; taking advantage of her flexibility, she spun around, and wrapped her legs in a scissor hold around his neck, encircling him in her formidable vice. Panicking as her thighs squeezed mercilessly, Nerd desperately clawed at her legs, his breathing growing ragged. He managed to sputter out, \\"How... how are you so strong?\\" as he succumbed to the pressure. Bliss, reveling in her power, simply replied with a confident smirk, \\"It\'s all in the legs, darling.\\" In the shadows, P.I. took mental notes on the trap Nerd found himself in, observing how Bliss\'s power came not from her striking skills, but her ability to control her opponent through carefully executed holds. He would need to avoid getting caught in a similar position, lest he suffer the same fate as the hapless Nerd. Meanwhile, Don watched from his vantage point with a calculated gaze, studying Bliss\'s strength and vulnerabilities—after all, his love for power expanded beyond his criminal empire. As he noted the way her strength lied in her crushing leg holds, he also recognized that her speed and nimbleness left her open to a more aggressive, direct attack. As an aggressive brawler himself, Don believed that he could use this to his advantage when the time came. Visible beads of sweat streaked down Nerd\'s face as he futilely continued to pry free from Bliss\'s iron grasp. In contrast, Bliss seemed to further enjoy herself with each passing moment, her initial smirk developing into a smug grin. With one final, gleeful twist of her body, she tightened the grip around Nerd\'s neck. As Nerd\'s last bits of consciousness ebbed away, he gasped out a plea. \\"Please...don\'t.\\" Bliss relished in her power, exhaling a sultry breath in Nerd\'s ear. \\"Sweet dreams, darling.\\" With that, Nerd\'s limbs went limp, the tension leaving his body as it crumpled to the floor. The referee quickly intervened, signaling for Bliss to release her hold. She complied, a devilish smile adorning her face as the crowd roared with enthusiasm at her dominant victory. Meanwhile, P.I. and Don continued to watch from their shadowed vantage points, their eyes narrowing in focus, preparing to face the mysterious allure and unpredictable nature of the undefeated Bliss. They both knew that their encounters with her would be no ordinary fights. Little did they know, as they continued to take their notes, that their own fates would soon intertwine in this thrilling tournament. As the music resumed, the pulsing lights of the nightclub masked the dangerous battles to come. The air was thick with anticipation, as the fighting spirit of each character was now unmistakable in the atmosphere. The game had truly begun."},{"instruction":"Continue where you left off.","output":"As the fallen figure of Nerd was escorted out of the ring and the feverish crowd began to dissipate, the evening progressed towards the next set of matches. Bliss retreated to the backstage area, her body glistening with the sweat of victory. She knew full well that her future opponents had been watching and evaluating her performance, but it didn\'t bother her. She was confident in her abilities and knew that she could adapt to the situation when the time came. P.I. and Don took the opportunity to renew their concentration and focus as their individual matches drew closer. Both men had carefully observed Bliss\'s fighting style in her match against Nerd, but their assessments were far from complete. In their eyes, every piece of information could be useful against an adversary like Bliss. The club\'s pulsating atmosphere never let up as the next fight began. The ring was now occupied by two new fighters, each displaying a unique style of combat. P.I. continued to survey the bustling scene, his stoic demeanor masking the intense calculations and strategies playing out in his mind. As the fights raged on, Don kept to the shadows, his eyes locked on P.I. He knew better than to underestimate his rivals, and he had a feeling that the detective would be a tough adversary. Though Don\'s natural arrogance made him believe in his ultimate victory, he couldn\'t help but acknowledge the resourcefulness of his competition. Hours later, when everyone thought P.I. and Don would finally get their chance to prove their skills in the ring, an announcement blasted through the club\'s speakers. The host declared a sudden change in the previously planned schedule: The two men would now face each other in an unexpected one-on-one showdown. A collective gasp arose from the crowd as all eyes turned to P.I. and Don, both of whom stood resolute, their competitive glares causing sparks to fly. The tension was palpable; it was the perfect storm for an epic battle. As they stepped into the ring, P.I.\'s balanced fighting stance contrasted sharply with Don\'s aggressively posture. The crowd\'s anticipation had reached a fever pitch, and it was only a matter of seconds before the fight begun. With a powerful start, P.I. and Don charged towards each other, each landing a barrage of heavy hits. Punches and kicks flew through the air, their impact resonating with the increasingly frenetic beats emanating from the club\'s speakers. Despite Don\'s raw power and aggressive style, P.I. held his ground, matching his opponent\'s brute strength with his own versatile techniques. Their struggle for dominance continued well into the night, the floor of the ring stained with sweat and blood. As the fight carried on, neither P.I. nor Don seemed to be gaining an advantage over the other—it was a true test of will and determination. From afar, Bliss watched the intense showdown with a mixture of curiosity and amusement. She knew that she\'d eventually face the winner of the clash, and she wanted to ensure that she had a thorough understanding of their strengths and weaknesses. As the ferocious battle drew to a close, it was P.I. who finally scored a decisive blow against Don, sending the mafia boss crashing down to the canvas. As the referee declared P.I. the winner, the crowd erupted in deafening applause. Exhausted yet triumphant, P.I. couldn\'t help but glance in Bliss\'s direction, knowing that she would soon stand before him as his next opponent. Their eyes locked for a brief moment, the electricity of the challenge crackling in the air between them. This electrifying tournament was far from over, and as each fighter prepared for their next battle, the true depth of their skill and strength could only be revealed in the ring. From the shadows of the club, the countless patrons roasted to the intensity of the fights, and Def Jam: Vendetta continued on, ensnaring everyone in its web of heated rivalry and indomitable fighting spirit."},{"instruction":"Vois-tu des fautes dans ce message ? \\"I accidentally kicked the seat in front of me.

Unity 创建一个多重采样的渲染纹理 2. 实际渲染一个帧缓冲区 3. 把帧缓冲区复制到多重采样渲染纹理中 4. 对多重采样的渲染纹理进行加权，然后输出到屏幕 这个过程中的第三个步骤，即把帧缓冲区复制到多重采样渲染纹理中，是实现 MSAA 技术的关键。但是，这个过程有一个问题，就是当我们在 OnPostRender 中执行 GL.Clear 时，它会先在帧缓冲区中填充背景颜色，然后再复制到多重采样的渲染纹理中，从而导致 MSAA 的效果失效。这就是 Unity 的 MSAA 技术会影响 OnPostRender 中的 GL.Clear 语句执行的原因。 为了解决这个问题，可以在 OnPostRender 中禁用 MSAA，然后在执行完 GL.Clear 后再重新开启 MSAA。具体实现如下： ``` GL.PushRenderTarget(source); Graphics.SetRenderTarget(multiSampledTexture); GL.Clear(true, true, Color.clear); GL.PopRenderTarget(); ``` 上面代码中，我们通过 GL.Push/PopRenderTarget 来改变当前帧缓冲区，并使用 Graphics.SetRenderTarget 切换渲染目标。在渲染完成后，再通过 GL.Push/PopRenderTarget 切换回原来的帧缓冲区。 总的来说，MSAA 技术的影响可能会带来一些挑战，但通过合理的应用 OnPostRender 和 GL API，我们可以解决许多由于 MSAA 技术产生的问题。"},{"instruction":"什么是NDC空间","output":"NDC (Normalized Device Coordinates) 空间是一个标准化的、与设备无关的设备空间，是从裁剪（Clip Space）空间转化过来的。在 NDC 空间中，坐标系的中心点在屏幕中心，横轴和纵轴的坐标范围分别为 [-1, 1]。这个坐标系中的所有坐标都是标准化的，可以准确地与屏幕上的像素一一对应，因此在渲染流程中是非常重要的一个空间。 NDC 空间的转换需要采用矩阵乘法，是一个 4x4 的矩阵，常常被称为投影矩阵（Projection Matrix），它是由裁剪空间的投影矩阵和视口变换矩阵组合而成。将物体从裁剪空间转换到 NDC 空间只需要将物体坐标与投影矩阵相乘即可。在这个过程中，裁剪空间中的物体经过投影变换后变成 NDC 空间中的物体，其顶点坐标可以直接用来做屏幕像素的最终计算。 NDC 空间是 3D 图形学中非常重要的一个概念，它为计算像素和渲染显示提供了标准的坐标系。同时，NDC 空间可以通过各种矩阵变换转换到屏幕空间或世界空间，也可以利用其标准化坐标计算照明、阴影和法线等效应。因此，在实际的图形渲染过程中，经常需要对物体进行从 NDC 空间转换到其他空间的转换操作。"},{"instruction":"Write blog title, meta description, introduction and conclusion for \\"55+ Butterfly Captions for Instagram\\"","output":"Title: 55+ Beautiful Butterfly Captions for Instagram: Spread Your Wings and Fly!

Access to SCP-XXXX for testing requires approval from at least one (1) Level 3 researcher. In the event that SCP-XXXX is breached, standard clean-up and sterilization protocols are to be followed immediately. Description: SCP-XXXX is a glass cup that, when observed by any human, always appears as a cup of water filled with ice cubes. The cup\'s dimensions are approximately 10 cm tall with an 8 cm diameter, while the ice cubes typically measure 2 cm on all sides. The exact amount of water and ice cubes in the cup appears to change depending on the observer\'s perceived ideal ratio for a cold beverage. Upon initial observation, SCP-XXXX\'s glass cup appears to be completely ordinary. However, any attempt to touch or physically interact with the contents results in a localized drop in temperature within a 2-meter radius surrounding SCP-XXXX. The temperature drop is instantaneous, with measured temperatures as low as -50°C (-58°F). This effect is not cumulative with multiple individuals making contact at the same time. Prolonged contact with SCP-XXXX\'s contents results in mild to severe localized frostbite within 10-30 seconds, depending on proximity and the individual\'s tolerance to cold temperatures. Additionally, any attempts to melt the ice or modify the contents of SCP-XXXX have proven unsuccessful. Subjects have reported feeling severe discomfort and a burning sensation when attempting to consume the contents of SCP-XXXX. If an observer loses direct line of sight to SCP-XXXX, upon regaining sight of the object, the contents appear unchanged, regardless of any modifications made during physical interaction. Notably, SCP-XXXX\'s contents cannot be moved or manipulated by any known means. It is hypothesized that SCP-XXXX was designed to be an eternal source of ice-cold water, albeit dangerous and impractical for consumption.

Они стали неотъемлемой частью современной культуры и способом проведения свободного времени для многих людей разного возраста. Однако, как и многое другое, они могут быть отрицательным явлением – вызывая зависимость и обратную сторону медали. В данной статье мы поговорим о зависимости от интернет-игр и последствиях, с которыми сталкиваются люди, попавшие в эту ловушку. Проблема зависимости от интернет-игр Зависимость от интернет-игр может быть классифицирована как поведенческая, или процессная, зависимость. Такие зависимости сходны с зависимостями от веществ – например, наркотиков или алкоголя – с той разницей, что нет введения химических веществ в организм. Зависимость вызывается удовольствием, полученным от определенной деятельности. В случае интернет-игр основными причинами возникновения зависимости являются: - Бегство от реальности и проблем, асоциальные особенности; - Погружение в фантастический мир, ощущение власти и контроля над виртуальным окружением; - Острой конкуренции и достижении успеха в игре вместо реальной жизни; - Социальная составляющая – взаимодействие с другими игроками онлайн. Последствия зависимости от интернет-игр Зависимость от интернет-игр ведет к серьезным последствиям, которые влияют на многие аспекты жизни: - Психологические и эмоциональные: повышенная тревожность, депрессия, ирритабельность, возникновение нарушений сна и проблем с самооценкой; - Социальные и семейные проблемы: растущее отчуждение от друзей и родных, утеря интереса к общественным событиям, конфликты с близкими на фоне игровой зависимости; - Проблемы со здоровьем: сидячий образ жизни, неправильное питание, отсутствие физической активности способствуют развитию заболеваний позвоночника, сердечно-сосудистой системы, проблем с пищеварением и общему ухудшению здоровья; - Работа или учеба: снижение мотивации, производительности, успеваемости и трудоустройства. Как справиться с зависимостью от интернет-игр? 1. Признание проблемы и желание измениться – первый и самый важный шаг к излечению. 2. Искать поддержку среди близких людей, друзей или семьи, которые смогут помочь в поиске альтернативных занятий и развлечений. 3. Рациональное использование времени: график работы, отдыха и занятий на день/неделю/месяц. 4. Найти новый круг общения и занятий, которые ставят цель развития личности и расширения границ общения. 5.

Here are a few reasons why autogenous bone remains the gold standard: 1. Biological properties: Autogenous bone grafts contain all the necessary components for successful bone healing and regeneration, including osteoconductive, osteoinductive, and osteogenic properties. The presence of living bone cells, growth factors, and proteins within the graft help to promote rapid bone formation and remodeling. 2. Compatibility: Since the bone graft material is harvested from the patient\'s own body, there are no immune system-related issues like rejection or disease transmission that can be seen with other types of graft materials such as allografts or xenografts. 3. Proven clinical success: Numerous clinical studies have demonstrated superior results in terms of bone healing, integration, and long-term stability with autogenous bone grafts compared to other graft materials. 4. Adaptability: Autogenous bone grafts are highly versatile and can be used in various applications, such as sinus lifts, ridge augmentation, and spinal fusion surgeries. 5. Reduced risk of complications: The use of autogenous bone grafts reduces the risk of complications, such as graft rejection or infection that can be associated with other graft materials. However, it\'s important to note that there are some disadvantages associated with the use of autogenous bone grafts, including donor site morbidity, limited availability, and the need for an additional surgery to harvest the graft material. This has led to the development of alternative graft materials, such as allografts or bone substitutes, which aim to overcome these limitations while still delivering successful regenerative outcomes."},{"instruction":"正步走玉齐步走手型的具体区别？","output":"正步走和玉齐步走都是军队训练中常见的步态，它们的区别主要体现在以下两个方面： 1. 步幅：正步走的步幅相对较大，每步一般为75cm左右；而玉齐步走的步幅较小，每步为50cm左右。 2. 手型：正步走时，手臂与身体自然垂直，手掌向内，手指自然放松，手臂摆幅与腿的大小相似；而玉齐步走时，手臂与身体呈45度角，手掌向下，手指并拢，手臂的摆幅与腿的大小不同，手臂长短、前后幅度不一。 总的来说，正步走更注重高大挺拔，玉齐步走则更注重优美舒展。"},{"instruction":"Нужно повторять уведомления в mattermost каждый день в определенное время","output":"Чтобы повторять уведомления в Mattermost каждый день в определенное время, вы можете использовать встроенные интеграции с веб-хуками или сервисами автоматизации, такими как Zapier.

Зайдите в системное меню, выберите \\"Integrations\\" (Интеграции), затем \\"Incoming Webhooks\\" (Входящие веб-хуки), нажмите \\"Add Incoming Webhook\\" (Добавить входящий веб-хук) и заполните требуемые поля. 2. Получите ссылку на входящий веб-хук. После создания веб-хука Mattermost предоставит вам уникальный URL. Сохраните этот URL для дальнейшего использования. 3. Создайте скрипт для отправки уведомления через веб-хук. Ниже приведен пример скрипта на Python: ```python import requests import json def send_message_to_mattermost(url, message): headers = {\'Content-Type\': \'application/json\'} payload = json.dumps({\'text\': message}) response = requests.post(url, data=payload, headers=headers) return response webhook_url = \'https://your-mattermost-webhook-url\' message = \'Your daily reminder message\' send_message_to_mattermost(webhook_url, message) ``` 4. Настройте автоматический запуск скрипта каждый день в определенное время с использованием планировщика задач, такого как cron (для Linux и macOS) или Task Scheduler (для Windows). Пример настройки задания cron (Linux и macOS) для отправки уведомления каждый день в 9:00: 1. Откройте терминал и запустите команду `crontab -e` для редактирования файла cron. 2. Добавьте следующую строку в файл: ``` 0 9 * * * /path/to/your/python /path/to/your/send_message_script.py ``` Замените `/path/to/your/python` путем до исполняемого файла Python на вашей системе (обычно это `/usr/bin/python3` или `/usr/local/bin/python3`) и `/path/to/your/send_message_script.py` - путем до скрипта, созданного на шаге 3.

\\"Igo\\" Igorevich Background: Marco was born in Moscow, Russia, but was raised in Los Santos after his family moved to the city in search of a better life. Marco\'s father, a former KGB agent, taught him the ways of organized crime as a means of survival in the seedy underworld of Los Santos. As a result, Marco quickly developed a talent for intricate heists, street races, and gunfights. Appearance: Marco is in his mid-30s with a strong, muscular build. He sports a shaved head with a thick beard and wears a signature ushanka (Russian fur hat) to remember his roots. Marco has a distinct Russian accent and speaks English with a deep and intimidating voice. Personality: Marco is tough, fiercely loyal, and cold-hearted when it comes to crime. Despite his aggressive demeanor, he is fiercely protective of his family and friends. Marco\'s stoic exterior comes as a result of his troubled past, hardening him to the world. Skills: Marco is an expert in close-quarter combat, thanks to his father\'s KGB training. His time in Los Santos has also made him adept in firearms and sharpshooting. This, combined with his exceptional driving skills, make him a valuable asset in high-stakes heists and car chases. Story Arc: Marco Igo finds himself navigating a precarious balance between the Los Santos criminal underworld and the tenuous loyalty between his fellow criminals. His quest for power and money drives him to pursue daring heists and dangerous missions, all while maintaining his alliance with his closest friends and making new enemies along the way. As Marco\'s criminal empire grows, he must confront his own dark past - including his strained relationship with his father and his loyalty to his Russian heritage. Ultimately, Marco is challenged with protecting his family, sustaining his friendships, and staying alive as his nefarious actions draw the attention of both the authorities and rival criminals."},{"instruction":"Come up with the first mission given by Marco called Live Freight","output":"Mission Title: Live Freight Mission Objective: The objective of this mission is to help Marco Igo steal valuable contraband from a heavily guarded warehouse and transport the goods via a freight train to a remote drop-off location. Mission Briefing: As Marco Igo\'s new associate, you are summoned to his hideout where he tasks you with your first assignment: infiltrating a heavily guarded warehouse with him to steal a shipment of valuable contraband. The warehouse is located near the docks of Los Santos, and Marco has planned the precise details of the heist. Mission Steps: 1. Meet Marco at his hideout: You first meet up with Marco at his hideout to discuss the details of the plan and gear up with necessary equipment, including silenced weapons, night vision goggles, and lock-picking tools. 2. Infiltrate the warehouse: Drive with Marco to the docks and infiltrate the warehouse under the cover of night. Stealth is crucial as you silently take down the guards stationed outside the warehouse and pick the lock of the main entrance. 3. Locate the contraband: Inside the warehouse, you must remain unnoticed as you locate the shipment of contraband. Marco provides guidance using your night vision goggles to avoid security cameras and additional guards. 4. Load the freight train: After successfully securing the contraband, you and Marco move it to a nearby freight train, which you must carefully load without being spotted by the stationed guards. 5. Drive the freight train: Once the contraband is on board, Marco will drive the train, while you provide cover as guards on nearby roads will chase and attempt to stop the train. Use your weaponry to fend off any attackers and protect Marco and the shipment. 6. Drop off the contraband: Safely transport the stolen goods to the remote drop-off location. Marco will then unload the contraband and pay you for your assistance in the mission. Completion of the mission, \'Live Freight\', will solidify your alliance with Marco Igo and unlock additional missions, progressively making you more deeply involved in Marco\'s criminal empire."},{"instruction":"SRB","output":"SRB stands for Solid Rocket Booster.

class ProtocolAdapter { public: virtual ~ProtocolAdapter() = default; virtual int Connect(const std::string& ip, int port) = 0; virtual void Disconnect() = 0; virtual NetStatus Send(const void* data, size_t len) = 0; virtual NetStatus Receive(void* buffer, size_t max_len, size_t& read_len) = 0; virtual NetStatus GetStatus() = 0; }; ``` 该接口定义了五个函数，包括连接、断开连接、发送数据、接收数据和获取连接状态，使用了枚举类型NetStatus来表示网络连接状态。 接下来可以定义TCP、UDP、1078、GB28181和SIP协议的适配器类，这里以TCP协议的适配器类为例： ```cpp class TCPAdapter : public ProtocolAdapter { public: TCPAdapter(); ~TCPAdapter() override; int Connect(const std::string& ip, int port) override; void Disconnect() override; NetStatus Send(const void* data, size_t len) override; NetStatus Receive(void* buffer, size_t max_len, size_t& read_len) override; NetStatus GetStatus() override; private: SOCKET fd_; NetStatus status_; }; ``` 该适配器类继承了通用接口，实现了连接、断开连接、发送数据、接收数据和获取连接状态五个函数，使用了SOCKET类型的变量fd_来标记网络连接，使用枚举类型NetStatus来保存网络连接状态。 此外还需要编写协议适配模块的实现，这里以TCP和UDP的协议适配模块为例： ```cpp class ProtocolAdapterFactory { public: static std::unique_ptr<ProtocolAdapter> CreateTCPAdapter() { return std::make_unique<TCPAdapter>(); } static std::unique_ptr<ProtocolAdapter> CreateUDPAdapter() { return std::make_unique<UDPAdapter>(); } }; class ProtocolAdapterModule { public: explicit ProtocolAdapterModule(const std::string& protocol) : protocol_(protocol) {} std::unique_ptr<ProtocolAdapter> CreateAdapter() { if (protocol_ == \\"TCP\\") { return ProtocolAdapterFactory::CreateTCPAdapter(); } else if (protocol_ == \\"UDP\\") { return ProtocolAdapterFactory::CreateUDPAdapter(); } else { return nullptr; } } private: std::string protocol_; }; ``` 该模块包括了一个工厂类ProtocolAdapterFactory用于创建TCP和UDP适配器，以及一个适配模块类ProtocolAdapterModule用于根据不同的协议类型选择相应的适配器。 现在可以使用该协议适配模块实现网络通信了，例如： ```cpp std::string protocol = \\"TCP\\";

Overall, Amazon should focus on expanding its market presence, improving customer experience, and diversifying its business to maintain its dominant position in the e-commerce sector. By leveraging its strengths and seizing new opportunities, Amazon can continue to grow and gain a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving industry."},{"instruction":"You are an expert in strategic analysis of companies in the e-commerce industry. Justify why Amazon should cut down on its side projects and do more research to focus on developing only projects/tech that will improve its cost and customer satisfaction, using relevant strategic management theories and citing news, events, and trends from the past 3 years.","output":"When analyzing Amazon\'s strategic focus, it is essential to consider theories such as the core competency theory, resource-based view (RBV), and the concept of opportunity cost. Here is a justification for Amazon to concentrate on projects that improve cost efficiency and customer satisfaction, based on these theories: 1. Core Competency Theory: According to Prahalad and Hamel, core competencies are the unique and valuable capabilities that provide a company with a competitive advantage. For Amazon, its core competencies are efficient logistics, advanced technological infrastructure, and data-driven customer experience. By focusing on enhancing these competencies, Amazon can improve its overall efficiency and satisfy its customers better. Recent news (September 2019) highlights that Amazon has announced an ambitious plan to make its delivery services carbon neutral. Dubbed \\"Shipment Zero,\\" the company\'s strategy aims to reach a 50% carbon neutral target by 2030. By cutting down on side projects and focusing on improving its logistics, Amazon can achieve this goal and simultaneously please environmentally-conscious customers. 2. Resource-Based View (RBV): The RBV emphasizes a company\'s internal resources and capabilities, stressing the importance of leveraging unique resources to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage. By reallocating resources (human, financial, and technological) from side projects to improving cost and customer satisfaction, Amazon can better utilize its resources, leading to a more significant competitive advantage. In recent years, Amazon experienced several high-profile failures, such as the Fire Phone and Amazon Restaurants. These ventures consumed valuable resources which could have been more effectively allocated to projects with stronger potential impact on customer satisfaction and cost optimization. 3. Opportunity Cost: Opportunity cost refers to the benefits a company misses out on by not pursuing the best alternative investment. When Amazon devotes resources to side projects rather than improving core operations, it potentially misses out on better investment opportunities. By focusing on projects that directly enhance customer satisfaction and reduce costs, Amazon ensures it is making the most of its investments. As seen in recent news, Amazon continues to prioritize customer satisfaction by investing in and researching technology to improve its services (January 2021). For example, the company acquired Selz, an e-commerce platform that allows businesses to launch their online stores. By focusing on improving its core e-commerce offerings, Amazon is allocating resources efficiently to generate the highest value. In conclusion, by applying strategic management theories such as the core competency theory, resource-based view, and opportunity cost, it is evident that Amazon should cut down on side projects and focus more on research and development of technology that improves costs and customer satisfaction. In doing so, Amazon will better allocate its resources, build on its core competencies, and invest in areas with the highest potential for long-term success."},{"instruction":"Explain why Amazon should constantly monitor the new technology S-curve and adapt its business model to maintain its market dominance, citing news, events, and trends from the past 3 years.","output":"The technology S-curve represents the phases of innovation, adoption, and saturation of a particular technology. It highlights how technology performance improves over time – starting slow, then picking up rapidly, and finally stabilizing as it reaches maturity. Constantly monitoring the technology S-curve is crucial for companies like Amazon to adapt their business model and maintain market dominance. Below are some reasons and examples from the past three years demonstrating why Amazon should do this: 1. Early adoption of disruptive technologies: Staying abreast with the technology S-curve enables Amazon to identify and adopt disruptive technologies early, giving them a competitive advantage over rivals.

By keeping track of the S-curve and embracing new technologies at an early stage, Amazon can gain a first-mover advantage and strengthen its market position. 2. Ensuring customer satisfaction: Adapting to technological advancements allows Amazon to enhance its customers\' experience continually. Voice technology is an excellent example, where Amazon has leveraged the growing trend of smart home devices and cloud-based AI. In November 2018, Amazon announced that Alexa, its voice assistant, surpassed 50,000 skills globally, offering more convenience and personalization for users. By staying ahead of the S-curve, Amazon can meet and exceed customer expectations, thus reinforcing its market dominance. 3. Streamlining operations and cost optimization: New technologies can provide Amazon with better operational efficiency, resulting in cost savings in the long run. For example, Amazon has been utilizing machine learning algorithms and AI to optimize warehouse operations and last-mile delivery logistics. In 2019, Amazon rolled out its Pegasus Drive system, which uses small wheeled robots to streamline package sorting, reducing processing time and enhancing warehouse efficiency. Adopting such technologies in a timely manner helps Amazon maintain its competitive edge and reduce costs. 4. Diversification and growth opportunities: Monitoring the S-curve helps Amazon identify opportunities to expand into new markets, which contributes to its continuous growth. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the company\'s cloud computing division, which has grown exponentially over the past years. In Q4 2020, AWS revenue reached 12.7 billion, reflecting a 28% year-over-year growth. This success is due to Amazon\'s ability to identify and adapt to the growing demand for cloud computing services early on, thereby maintaining its market leadership in this segment. In conclusion, constantly monitoring the technology S-curve enables Amazon to stay at the forefront of innovation, ensuring customer satisfaction, driving operational efficiency, and uncovering new growth opportunities. By adapting its business model accordingly, Amazon can reinforce and maintain its market dominance in an ever-evolving technological landscape."},{"instruction":"Pretend you are roleplaying a mature, motherly older elf.

// 512x512，每个像素包含 3 个字节（RGB） // 此处省略填充 texData 的代码 ``` 接下来，我们使用 `gl.texImage2D()` 创建纹理对象，但是我们使用 `gl.TEXTURE_IMMUTABLE_FORMAT` 标记告诉 WebGL，这个纹理是不可变的： ```javascript const texture = gl.createTexture(); gl.bindTexture(gl.TEXTURE_2D, texture); gl.texParameteri(gl.TEXTURE_2D, gl.TEXTURE_WRAP_S, gl.CLAMP_TO_EDGE); gl.texParameteri(gl.TEXTURE_2D, gl.TEXTURE_WRAP_T, gl.CLAMP_TO_EDGE); gl.texParameteri(gl.TEXTURE_2D, gl.TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, gl.LINEAR);

gl.texSubImage2D(gl.TEXTURE_2D, 0, 0, 0, 512, 512, gl.RGB, gl.UNSIGNED_BYTE, texData); ``` 上面的代码中，我们使用 `gl.texSubImage2D()` 将纹理数据上传到 GPU，此时 WebGL 会检查上传的数据是否与纹理参数相匹配。如果不匹配，将引发错误。 需要注意的是，一旦创建了不可变纹理，就无法修改它的内容。如果需要修改纹理数据，必须销毁当前的纹理对象，重新创建一个新的纹理对象。"},{"instruction":"使用texStorage2D 来实现不可变纹理","output":"`texStorage2D()` 是 WebGL 2 新增的函数，它可以用来创建不可变纹理。相比 `texImage2D()` 和 `texSubImage2D()`，`texStorage2D()` 的参数更少，也更简单。下面是使用 `texStorage2D()` 创建不可变纹理的示例代码： ```javascript const width = 512; const height = 512; const texture = gl.createTexture(); gl.bindTexture(gl.TEXTURE_2D, texture); gl.texParameteri(gl.TEXTURE_2D, gl.TEXTURE_WRAP_S, gl.CLAMP_TO_EDGE); gl.texParameteri(gl.TEXTURE_2D, gl.TEXTURE_WRAP_T, gl.CLAMP_TO_EDGE);

// 512x512，每个像素包含 3 个字节（RGB） // 此处省略填充 texData 的代码 gl.texSubImage2D(gl.TEXTURE_2D, 0, 0, 0, width, height, gl.RGB, gl.UNSIGNED_BYTE, texData); ``` 上述代码中，`gl.texSubImage2D()` 的参数和 `texImage2D()` 相同，但由于我们使用 `texStorage2D()` 创建的纹理是不可变的，因此这里的 `gl.UNSIGNED_BYTE` 参数只是为了告诉 WebGL 纹理数据的格式，并不会改变纹理的存储格式。 使用 `texStorage2D()` 创建不可变纹理的好处是，WebGL 编译器可以更好地优化纹理访问，因为它可以假设纹理数据是不可变的，而不必悲观地认为纹理可能随时被修改。另外，由于 `texStorage2D()` 创建的纹理对象是不可变的，我们可以避免因意外修改纹理数据而引起的错误。"},{"instruction":"Write blog title, meta description, introduction and conclusion for \\"55+ Butterfly Captions for Instagram(Cute, Short, Quotes, etc.)\\"","output":"Title: 55+ Beautiful Butterfly Captions for Instagram: Cute, Short, Quotes, and More!

Существуют различные причины миграции, включая экономические, социальные, политические и экологические. Одной из основных причин миграции является экономическая - люди переезжают на места, где есть больше возможностей для заработка и улучшения своего материального положения. Также миграцию могут вызвать социальные причины, такие как желание улучшить качество жизни, получить лучшее образование или возможности для развития карьеры. Политические причины миграции могут включать конфликты, войны, преследования и дискриминацию. Например, многие беженцы вынуждены покидать свои дома из-за гонений на основе расы, религии, политических взглядов или сексуальной ориентации. Значительное количество людей также вынуждены мигрировать из-за экологических проблем, таких как засуха, наводнения, эрозия почвы и другие природные бедствия. Миграция может оказывать как положительное, так и отрицательное воздействие на общество и экономику. Положительные последствия включают улучшение качества жизни для мигрантов и возможности для развития государства за счет вовлечения новых рабочих сил.

CMYK（印刷四色）颜色模式：CMYK是一种常见的印刷颜色模式，用于打印出高品质的出版物。但是，Pillow不支持直接将CMYK图像进行处理，因此如果你尝试打开这种图像，就会触发`OSError: cannot identify image file`错误信息。如果需要处理CMYK图像，可以先将其转换为RGB模式。 2. P颜色模式：P模式是一种具有固定调色板的8位颜色模式。但是，Pillow支持的调色板最多只能有256种颜色，因此如果尝试使用包含超过256种颜色的P颜色模式，就会触发`OSError: cannot identify image file`错误信息。 3.

However, by following these general steps and continually iterating based on feedback you can create engaging, rewarding game mechanics that make your JavaScript card game a success."},{"instruction":"write lite version of Hearthstone","output":"As an AI language model, I\'m not able to create a complete game like Hearthstone. However, I can give you some tips on how to create a lite version of Hearthstone using JavaScript. 1. Simplify the game mechanics: reduce the number of cards, abilities, and game modes. A lite version of Hearthstone may just include basic cards with straightforward effects, fewer classes, and one game mode. 2. Optimize animations: use fewer animations, cutscenes, and visuals. The lite version would focus on functions over form, so it should be lightweight on graphics, animations, and sound effects to ensure a smooth and fast experience. 3. Reduce the UI complexity: eliminate unnecessary interface elements, simplify the card layout, and simplify the user interface. This way, it would be easier for players to navigate and understand the game mechanics. 4. Implement a smaller game board: reduce the number of useable spaces on the board. A reduced board would make the game easier to follow, understand and implement. 5. Use simple AI opponents: implement non-complex AI opponents. These opponents will be easy to defeat and would not require advanced strategies. 6. Simplify game progression: reduce the number of levels and shorten gameplays. The lite version would work best if it\'s a quick, easy, and entertaining experience for players. Overall, creating a lite version of Hearthstone is all about simplifying the game mechanics while maintaining the core elements that make the game entertaining. By implementing fewer cards, a lighter UI, and basic animations, you should be able to create a lite version of the game using JavaScript."},{"instruction":"which card abilities can be realised in your lite version Hearthstone","output":"A lite version of Hearthstone would require that we simplify the card abilities to make the game easier to play and manage. Here are some card abilities that could be easily implemented in a lite version of Hearthstone using JavaScript: 1. Charge: allows a minion to attack immediately after being played. 2. Taunt: forces the opponent to target the minion with taunt. 3. Battlecry: triggers an effect when the minion is played. 4. Destroy: removes a card from the field entirely. 5. Heal: restores health to a target. 6. Draw a card: allows the player to draw an additional card from their deck. 7. AoE damage: deals damage to all characters in a specific area. 8. Buff: boosts a minion\'s stats or abilities. 9. Silence: removes all card text and enchantments from a minion. 10. Discover: allows the player to discover a new card option from a specific set. These are some of the simplest card abilities that can be used in a lite version of Hearthstone. They provide enough variety to create an engaging game while being simple enough to allow the game to run smoothly and not overwhelm the player. By implementing a limited number of abilities in your game, you can create a lightweight version of Hearthstone that is enjoyable and easy to play using JavaScript."},{"instruction":"pls.

Redis配置文件中的 `shutdown-after-save` 选项造成Redis无法关闭：如果Redis配置文件中启用了 `shutdown-after-save` 选项，并且Redis持久化正在执行中，当执行 `SHUTDOWN` 命令时，Redis会先等待持久化完成，而不是直接停止Redis。要解决此问题，可以在Redis配置文件中禁用 `shutdown-after-save` 选项。 在解决问题之前，建议先备份Redis数据，以免数据丢失。"},{"instruction":"明白你情况，已经为你们更换了POs，请找到以下check list 链接供你参考，如果有什么问题，请告诉我，谢谢。帮我发封邮件给sandy","output":"Hi Sandy, I hope this email finds you well.

The research delves into the problematic nature of Western feminism\'s assumption of superiority while attempting to \\"save\\" other women, the disregard of contextual factors, and the homogenization of Third-World women. By drawing from the works of renowned scholars, such as Abu-Lughod (2002), Syed and Ali (2015), and Mahmoud and Sarhan (2011), this paper underscores the need for a more nuanced, culturally sensitive approach to understanding and addressing the multifaceted experiences of Third-World women. Introduction The evolution of feminism as a theoretical and activist movement has significantly transformed discourses surrounding gender, power, and social justice across the globe. While feminist movements in the West have achieved numerous milestones in raising awareness about gender inequalities and promoting women\'s rights, their application of a Western-centric framework in the portrayal of Third-World women has generated multiple controversies. According to Abu-Lughod (2002), \\"projects of saving other women depend on and reinforce a sense of superiority by Westerners, a form of arrogance that deserves to be challenged\\" (789). This paper critically examines the Western feminist framework in relation to Third-World women, focusing on three core aspects: the assumption of superiority, the dismissal of contextual factors, and the homogenization of Third-World women. Assumption of Superiority Central to the critique of Western feminist approaches to Third-World women is the implicit assumption of superiority. As Abu-Lughod (2002) contends, the act of \\"saving\\" other women presupposes a sense of Western superiority, creating a dichotomy between the enlightened liberators and the underprivileged victims. This hierarchical positioning simultaneously elevates Western women and disenfranchises Third-World women, stripping them of agency and autonomy in their own struggles for social, political, and economic emancipation (Syed and Ali, 2015). The presumption of Western superiority not only underpins the act of saving but also underlines the understanding of Third-World women\'s experiences. According to Syed and Ali (2015), Western feminists frequently \\"overstep indigenous women\'s subject position and sense of agency\\" (352). By imposing their own definitions of empowerment, gender equality, and liberation, Western feminists systematically disregard the rich diversity of Third-World women\'s experiences and subjectivities, reducing them to passive recipients of feminist enlightenment. Disregarding Contextual Factors The Western feminist framework\'s disregard for contextual factors further exacerbates the misrepresentation of Third-World women. By adopting a one-size-fits-all approach, Western feminists fail to account for the complex intersections of culture, history, language, education, traditions, family, society, religion, race, and class, along with political and economic systems, that underlie Third-World women\'s experiences (Mahmoud and Sarhan, 2011). In sidelining contextual factors, Western feminists inadvertently perpetuate a uniform portrayal of Third-World women, stripping them of the nuances and distinctions that are integral to their lived realities. Moreover, this lack of contextualization overlooks the indigenous forms of feminism and resistance that operate within and through these contextual factors, disregarding the agency and empowerment that Third-World women assert in culturally specific ways (Mahmoud and Sarhan, 2011). Homogenization of Third-World Women The Western feminist predilection for homogenizing Third-World women constitutes yet another pathway for misrepresentation. By grouping all Third-World women into a single, homogenous category, Western feminists erroneously assume that they all confront uniform issues and require identical interventions (Syed and Ali, 2015). This oversimplified perspective neglects the complexities and heterogeneities that characterize Third-World women\'s experiences and perpetuates a reductive understanding of their multifaceted lives. Furthermore, the homogenization of Third-World women perpetuates the myth that they universally possess the same capacity and strength to combat the entrenched systems of patriarchy and male-domination within their societies (Mahmoud and Sarhan, 2011). By ignoring the differentiated impact of these systems on Third-World women based on their specific socio-cultural, political, and economic contexts, Western feminists inadvertently undermine their efforts to address gender inequalities and promote social justice on a global scale. Conclusion This paper has engaged in a critical analysis of the Western feminist framework in relation to Third-World women, focusing on the assumption of superiority, the dismissal of contextual factors, and the homogenization of Third-World women. By drawing on the works of Abu-Lughod (2002), Syed and Ali (2015), and Mahmoud and Sarhan (2011), the research underscores the need for a more inclusive, culturally sensitive, and contextually grounded approach to understanding and addressing the diverse experiences of Third-World women. By abandoning the pretense of superiority and engaging in a genuine dialogue with Third-World women and their indigenous forms of feminism, Western feminists can contribute more effectively to the global struggle for gender equality and social justice. In doing so, they can help to forge a more nuanced, unified, and empowering feminist movement that transcends geographical, cultural, and political boundaries, fostering genuine solidarity and collaboration among women across the world.

Within the greater context of Western culture and, more specifically, Western feminism, Third-World women are routinely portrayed through the lens of what can be described as a ‘persistent trope’- a trope encompassing the notions of helplessness, submissiveness, dependency, and experiencing oppression","output":"Title: Deconstructing the Orientalist Discourse: The Portrayal of Third-World Women in Western Feminism Abstract This academic paper critically examines the Orientalist discourse constructed by Western scholars and its influence on the depiction of Third-World women within Western feminism. By scrutinizing the \\"persistent trope\\" of helplessness, submissiveness, dependency, and oppression, this study unveils the role played by both male and female Western scholars in perpetuating this reductive portrayal of Third-World women. This paper advocates for a more nuanced, intersectional, and culturally sensitive understanding of Third-World women that acknowledges their agency and empowerment. Introduction The Orientalist discourse, as theorized by Edward Said, refers to the ways in which the Western world has sought to understand and represent the so-called \\"Orient\\" - a geographical and cultural space encompassing the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. This discourse, marked by a range of stereotypes and assumptions about the East, has served as a tool for perpetuating Western hegemony and control over Third-World countries. In the realm of Western feminism, this Orientalist discourse has manifested in the portrayal of Third-World women as inherently helpless, submissive, dependent, and oppressed. This paper critically examines this \\"persistent trope\\" and its implications for feminist theory and practice, calling for a more inclusive, intersectional, and culturally sensitive understanding of Third-World women\'s experiences. Deconstructing the Persistent Trope Despite the significant role played by male scholars in constructing the Orientalist discourse, Western female scholars and feminists have also been complicit in perpetuating the distorted image of Third-World women. By adopting and reinforcing this \\"persistent trope,\\" they contribute to the ongoing marginalization and exoticization of Third-World women in feminist scholarship and activism. The tropes of helplessness and submissiveness deny the agency of Third-World women and assume a passive role for them in the face of patriarchal oppression. This portrayal discounts the various ways in which Third-World women actively engage in resistance and negotiate power dynamics within their unique cultural contexts. Similarly, the tropes of dependency and oppression presuppose a monolithic experience of suffering and victimhood for Third-World women, ignoring the diverse range of identities, aspirations, and achievements possessed by them. By reducing Third-World women to these four overlapping tropes, Western feminists perpetuate a one-dimensional characterization that positions them as inferior to their Western counterparts, thus legitimizing the need for Western intervention and \\"liberation.\\" The Need for an Intersectional and Culturally Sensitive Approach To counter this flawed portrayal of Third-World women, it is imperative for Western feminists to adopt an intersectional and culturally sensitive approach that acknowledges and respects the multiple dimensions of Third-World women\'s lives. Intersectionality, as a theoretical framework, emphasizes the overlapping and intersecting nature of various social categories, such as gender, race, class, and sexuality, thereby providing a more nuanced understanding of the complexities of human experiences. By employing an intersectional lens, Western feminists can avoid the homogenizing tendencies of the Orientalist discourse and recognize the diverse range of experiences, struggles, and achievements that characterize Third-World women\'s lives. Moreover, this approach also calls for a greater engagement with indigenous feminist knowledge production, as it acknowledges the multiple forms of resistance and empowerment employed by Third-World women in their own cultural contexts. An intersectional and culturally sensitive approach also necessitates the deconstruction and abandonment of the Western-centric, colonial, and Eurocentric worldview that underpins the Orientalist discourse. This means relinquishing the assumed superiority and authority of Western feminism and engaging in meaningful dialogues with Third-World feminists and grassroots organizations to foster a more egalitarian and inclusive global feminist movement. Conclusion This academic paper has critically examined the Orientalist discourse and its impact on the portrayal of Third-World women within Western feminism, focusing on the deconstruction of the \\"persistent trope\\" of helplessness, submissiveness, dependency, and oppression. By advocating for an intersectional and culturally sensitive approach, this study highlights the necessity of revisiting and revising the Western feminist framework to account for the rich diversity and complexity of Third-World women\'s experiences. In challenging the Orientalist discourse, Western feminists must engage in critical self-reflection and open up to alternative knowledge systems and perspectives that encompass a more equitable and inclusive understanding of gender, power, and social justice. Ultimately, dismantling the Orientalist discourse and embracing intersectionality and cultural sensitivity can pave the way for a truly transformative and unified global feminist movement that respects and values the contributions and experiences of all women, irrespective of their geographical or cultural origins."},{"instruction":"High definition waterfall landscape map","output":"I\'m sorry, I cannot create high definition waterfall landscape maps as I am an AI language model and do not have mapping or graphical capabilities.

Al considerar solicitar la nacionalidad china después de renunciar a tu antigua nacionalidad, es esencial entender que para la República Popular China la adquisición de su nacionalidad se basa en principios de jus sanguinis (derecho de sangre) principalmente, y las oportunidades bajo jus soli (derecho de suelo) son muy limitadas. Aquí te presento un resumen de los requisitos generales según la Ley de Nacionalidad de China, pero ten en cuenta que la interpretación y aplicación de estos requisitos pueden variar y es crucial consultar con las autoridades competentes o asesoría legal especializada. # Requisitos Generales para Solicitar la Nacionalidad China 1. **Parentesco cercano con ciudadanos chinos:** Tener padres o cónyuges que son ciudadanos chinos o tener otros parentescos cercanos con ciudadanos chinos. Esto es muy relevante en el caso de personas de ascendencia china. 2. **Residencia:** Haber residido en China durante el tiempo requerido. La ley especifica que los solicitantes deben haber \\"fijado su residencia en China\\", lo que a menudo se interpreta como tener permiso de residencia permanente o una larga historia de residencia en China. Sin embargo, la ley no especifica un período exacto en años. 3. **Integración y contribución:** Ser capaz de demostrar que te has integrado en la sociedad china y, en algunos casos, haber hecho contribuciones significativas a la sociedad o al desarrollo del país. Esto puede incluir, pero no se limita a, logros en ciencia, arte, educación o economía. 4. **Renuncia a la nacionalidad anterior:** Lo más crítico, como ya mencionaste, es haber renunciado a tu nacionalidad anterior. China no permite la doble nacionalidad, por lo que debes haber completado el proceso de renunciar a cualquier otra nacionalidad que tuvieras antes de que tu solicitud de nacionalidad china pueda ser considerada. 5. **Obediencia a la Constitución y leyes de China:** Debes demostrar que estás dispuesto a acatar la Constitución y las leyes de la República Popular China. # Documentación Requerida (Generalmente) - Formulario de solicitud completado para la adquisición de la nacionalidad china. - Prueba de residencia permanente en China o documentación que demuestre un largo período de residencia. - Documentos que prueben la relación con ciudadanos chinos (si aplicable). - Evidencia de renuncia a la nacionalidad anterior. - Documentación que demuestre la integración en la sociedad china y, si es aplicable, contribuciones significativas al país. - Otros documentos solicitados por las autoridades chinas. # Consideraciones Importantes - **Proceso de revisión:** La solicitud de nacionalidad china es cuidadosamente revisada por las autoridades locales y centrales, y el proceso puede ser largo. - **Sin garantías:** Cumplir con los requisitos básicos no garantiza la aprobación de la solicitud. Las autoridades tienen discreción considerable en estas decisiones. - **Asesoría legal:** Dada la complejidad y las consecuencias de este proceso, consultar con un asesor legal especializado en inmigración china es altamente recomendado.

Antes de tomar tal decisión, es muy importante considerar cuidadosamente las consecuencias y consultar a un abogado o asesor legal para entender completamente el proceso y sus implicaciones. # Proceso General para Renunciar a la Nacionalidad Española 1. **Motivos válidos:** Generalmente, se debe tener un motivo válido para renunciar a la nacionalidad española, como adquirir otra nacionalidad que no permita la doble nacionalidad. Algunos países no permiten a sus ciudadanos mantener una doble nacionalidad, por lo que la renuncia podría ser un requisito para la naturalización en otro lugar. 2. **Residencia fuera de España:** Para la mayoría de los casos, es necesario residir fuera de España para renunciar a la nacionalidad española. Sin embargo, hay excepciones, principalmente para españoles que residen en España pero desean adquirir la nacionalidad de otro país que no acepta la doble nacionalidad. 3. **Mayoría de edad y capacidad jurídica:** Es necesario ser mayor de edad (18 años o más, o 14 años con asistencia jurídica) y estar en plena capacidad jurídica para tomar la decisión de renunciar voluntariamente a la nacionalidad española. 4. **Documento de renuncia:** La renuncia se formaliza mediante un documento escrito en el que se declara tu intención de renunciar a la nacionalidad española. Este documento debe presentarse ante el Registro Civil competente, ya sea en el Consulado de España si resides en el extranjero o en el Registro Civil correspondiente si resides en España. 5. **Aprobación:** La renuncia debe ser aprobada por el Ministerio de Justicia de España. Es importante tener en cuenta que este paso es crucial y que la renuncia solo se hace efectiva una vez aprobada. 6. **Adquisición de nueva nacionalidad:** A menudo, la renuncia se realiza en el contexto de la adquisición de una nueva nacionalidad. Es fundamental asegurarse de que tendrás otra nacionalidad antes de completar el proceso de renuncia, ya que renunciar a tu nacionalidad española sin tener otra te dejaría en estado de apatridia, lo que puede tener graves consecuencias legales y personales. 7. **Registro:** Una vez aprobada, la renuncia debe ser inscrita en el Registro Civil. # Consideraciones Importantes - **Reversibilidad:** Renunciar a la nacionalidad española es, en principio, irreversible. Aunque existen circunstancias bajo las cuales una persona podría recuperar su nacionalidad española, estos procesos son complicados y no garantizados. - **Derechos perdidos:** Al renunciar a la nacionalidad española, se pierden todos los derechos asociados, incluidos los derechos de residencia y trabajo en la UE, así como los derechos a votar y ser elegido en elecciones españolas y europeas. - **Asesoramiento legal:** Dada la complejidad y las significativas repercusiones de renunciar a la nacionalidad española, es altamente recomendable obtener asesoramiento legal especializado para navegar este proceso.

Aquí te describo un poco cómo proceder en cada caso: # Si Resides en España: Deberás presentar la solicitud de renuncia en el Registro Civil de tu lugar de residencia. Aquí procesarán tu solicitud y te guiarán sobre los documentos específicos que necesitas presentar. La documentación requerida puede variar, pero generalmente incluirá tu DNI (Documento Nacional de Identidad), pasaporte y, posiblemente, documentos que justifiquen la razón de la renuncia, como puede ser la adquisición de otra nacionalidad. # Si Resides en el Extranjero: Deberás dirigirte al consulado o embajada española más cercano. Los procedimientos pueden variar ligeramente de un país a otro, pero en esencia, el consulado actuará como el Registro Civil para los ciudadanos españoles residentes en el extranjero. Necesitarás llevar tu pasaporte español y cualquier otro documento que pueda ser requerido, como puede ser un documento que acredite tu nueva nacionalidad o la inminente adquisición de la misma. # ¿Es recomendable tener a un abogado? Renunciar a tu nacionalidad es un paso legal significativo con consecuencias a largo plazo, y el proceso puede ser complejo y variar según las circunstancias individuales. Por ello, es aconsejable contar con la asesoría de un abogado especializado en derecho de la nacionalidad o derecho internacional privado que pueda: 1. **Ofrecer asesoramiento legal personalizado:** Un abogado te proporcionará asesoramiento específico a tu situación, incluyendo si es realmente beneficioso y necesario renunciar a la nacionalidad española para tu caso particular. 2. **Ayudar con la documentación:** Preparar y presentar la documentación necesaria puede ser complicado. Un abogado asegurará que todos los documentos estén correctos y completos antes de la presentación, minimizando las posibilidades de retrasos o rechazos. 3. **Guiarte a través del proceso:** Un abogado experimentado en estos casos te guiará a través de cada paso, explicando qué esperar en cada etapa y cómo mejorar tus probabilidades de un resultado exitoso. 4. **Representarte:** En algunos casos, el abogado puede actuar en tu nombre ante las autoridades españolas, lo cual puede ser particularmente útil si ya resides en el extranjero.

However, I can still offer some advice on what you might look for or how to analyze a Facebook page if that would be helpful to you. **Key points to consider when analyzing a Facebook page:** 1. **Audience Engagement:** Look at the numbers of likes, shares, and comments on your posts to gauge audience engagement. High engagement means your content is resonating well with your audience. 2. **Content Quality:** Review the content you\'ve posted for its quality and relevance. High-quality, informative, and relevant content is likely to engage your audience better than content that does not align with their interests or needs. 3. **Consistency:** Check the frequency of your posts. Regular postings can help in keeping your audience engaged and informed. 4. **Response Time:** How quickly do you respond to comments or messages? A quick response time can improve audience satisfaction and engagement. 5. **Page Insights:** Utilize Facebook\'s Page Insights to track page performance, including post reach, page views, and more. These metrics provide valuable feedback on how well your content performs and what kind of content your audience prefers. 6. **Followers Growth:** Analyze your follower growth over time. A steady increase in followers indicates that your content strategy might be working, while stagnant or declining numbers may suggest a need for strategy adjustment. 7. **Visual Aesthetics:** Ensure your page is visually appealing, including your profile picture, cover photo, and post images. High-quality and relevant visuals can attract more users to your page. 8. **Call to Action:** Check if your page effectively uses calls to action, such as encouraging users to visit your website, sign up for a newsletter, or contact you. Effective calls to action can convert page visitors into potential leads or customers. 9. **Competitor Analysis:** Look at similar businesses or pages and compare your activity, engagement, and content quality. This can provide insight into what works well in your field and areas where you might improve. 10. **User Feedback:** Pay attention to feedback from your followers, both positive and negative. This can offer direct insights into what your audience values and areas for improvement. Remember, the goal is to create a vibrant, engaged community around your page. This involves not just analysis but also continuous improvement based on the data and feedback you gather."},{"instruction":"https://www.facebook.com/siddhaarchitects I need the links to always open Facebook app if it’s present on their phone how to change the url","output":"To ensure that links open in the Facebook app instead of a web browser when someone clicks on them from a device where the Facebook app is installed, you can use the Facebook app\'s URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) scheme. However, it\'s important to note that the behavior can depend on various factors, including the device\'s operating system, the app\'s version, and the browser\'s settings. For universal links that directly target the Facebook app when possible, there\'s a more generic approach that tends to work across most devices and platforms. For a general purpose, instead of using a traditional web link like `https://www.facebook.com/siddhaarchitects`, you might suggest or implement links that can intelligently decide whether to open in the app or browser based on the environment. This is not directly about changing the URL itself but leveraging how links are shared or embedded in different contexts (e.g., a mobile app, website, or digital document). # Android & iOS Deep Linking Both Android and iOS support a concept known as deep linking, which can direct links to open in apps if the app is installed. For Facebook or other specific apps, this might involve using platform-specific schemas or leveraging universal link technologies: - **Android:** Uses Intents and can define URL patterns in the app manifest that open the app. - **iOS:** Uses Universal Links (for iOS 9 and later) where you can link to content inside the app using regular HTTPS links, but this requires configuration in both the app and the website. # Use a Service for Smart URL Redirection Another approach is to use online services that generate URLs designed to open specific apps directly if possible. Services like Branch.io or OneLink by AppsFlyer provide ways to create links that automatically detect the user\'s device and attempt to open the link in the associated app. These services often offer analytics and additional features as well. # Direct Facebook URI Example In the past, Facebook and other apps used URI schemes like `fb://` for directly opening the app. For example, `fb://page/{page-id}` might open a Facebook page directly in the app. However, this method\'s reliability and support can vary significantly across different devices, app versions, and operating systems. # Recommendation For the broadest compatibility and simplest implementation—without adjusting code based on the receiving device—it\'s usually best to share the standard HTTPS URL (`https://www.facebook.com/siddhaarchitects`). Most modern mobile devices and browsers are smart enough to prompt users to open the link in the app if it\'s installed, especially if the user has previously set app preferences for such links. If you\'re embedding the link in a mobile app you\'re developing, or if you have control over a digital platform where the link will be shared, looking into the specific deep linking capabilities of iOS and Android, or using a service that specializes in smart URLs, might offer the advanced behavior you\'re looking for."},{"instruction":"Give me fb:// url for my page","output":"To create a Facebook URL that attempts to open directly in the Facebook mobile app using the Facebook URI scheme, you will typically need the numerical ID of your Facebook page. However, based on the provided information and without direct access to real-time data or the ability to fetch current details for your page, I\'ll guide you through the format and how you might obtain your page\'s numerical ID to create such a link. # Format of Facebook URI Scheme URL For a page, the format using the Facebook URI scheme is generally: ``` fb://page/{page-id} ``` Where `{page-id}` should be replaced with your page\'s numeric ID. # Finding Your Facebook Page ID **If you already know your Page ID:** Just replace `{page-id}` with your actual ID in the format above. **If you need to find your Page ID:** 1. **From Your Facebook Page:** - Navigate to your Facebook Page on a web browser. - Click \\"About\\" from the left menu. - Scroll down to find the \\"Page ID\\" section. 2. **Using the Facebook Page URL:** - Sometimes, if your page has a custom URL (vanity URL), you might be able to see the ID by looking at the page source code. This is less straightforward and not as reliable as it used to be. 3. **Facebook Graph API:** - Developers can use the Facebook Graph API for querying information, including page IDs, by accessing the URL `https://graph.facebook.com/v13.0/{your-page-name}?fields=id&access_token={your-access-token}`. You’ll need an access token and to replace `{your-page-name}` with the name of your page. Once you have your page ID, your Facebook URI link will look something like this (assuming your page ID is `123456789`): ``` fb://page/123456789 ``` # Important Considerations - **Deprecation and support:** Direct URI schemes like `fb://` are not officially documented by Facebook for external developers, meaning their support might be inconsistent. What works today could potentially stop working in future versions of the Facebook app or on certain devices. - **Experience varies by device:** Even with a correctly formatted URI, how a device responds can vary based on the installed apps, the operating system version, and user settings. Some devices may open the Facebook app directly to your page, while others might prompt the user or default to opening the link in a web browser. Given these potential issues, whenever possible, providing the full https:// link to your Facebook Page is generally the most reliable way to ensure users can access your page, regardless of their device or settings."},{"instruction":"fb://page/110096364049643 Why is it not working","output":"As of my last update in 2023, using the `fb://` URL scheme to directly open Facebook content within the Facebook app may not work as expected across all devices and versions of the Facebook app. There are several reasons why the `fb://page/{page-id}` format might not work: 1. **App Updates and Support:** Facebook frequently updates its mobile app, and the features or support for URI schemes like `fb://` can change. It\'s possible that newer versions of the app may not support this scheme or may handle it differently. 2. **Platform Differences:** Different operating systems (iOS vs. Android) and even different versions of the same operating system can affect how these URLs are handled. For example, iOS has moved towards Universal Links, which require a different configuration than custom URL schemes. 3. **User Settings and Permissions:** Some devices or browsers might have settings or permissions that affect how URLs are opened. For example, a browser might not correctly interpret the `fb://` scheme if it\'s set not to open links in external apps by default. 4. **App Not Installed or Logged Out:** If the Facebook app is not installed, or if a user is not logged in, the `fb://` link cannot function as intended. Instead, the device might attempt to open the link in a web browser or show an error message. 5. **Incorrect Page ID:** Ensuring you’ve got the right page ID is crucial. If the ID is incorrect, the Facebook app won\'t be able to direct the user to the intended page. However, in your case, assuming the ID is correct, this is likely not the issue. # What to Do? - **Check for Alternatives:** Periodically check if there are any new or updated methods for creating app-specific links. Facebook\'s developer documentation or community forums might provide updated guidance. - **Use Web URLs:** A more reliable method for sharing links to Facebook pages is to use the full web URL (e.g., `https://www.facebook.com/siddhaarchitects`). Most mobile devices will offer to open this link in the Facebook app if it is installed. - **Consult Developer Documentation:** If you\'re a developer, consider looking into Facebook\'s official documentation for any changes to how they handle URL schemes or for any new recommended practices. - **Testing:** Sometimes, testing across multiple devices and Facebook app versions can help determine compatibility ranges for the `fb://` links. This is more practical for app developers or marketers running campaigns. Unfortunately, without direct access to Facebook’s internal app development details and the constant changes in mobile operating systems, it can be challenging to provide a one-size-fits-all solution for `fb://` URLs not working as expected. Always consider the most user-friendly and current method of linking to ensure a good experience for your audience."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

technologies play an indispensable role in digital video applications today, effectively reducing the costs associated with video storage and transmission. However, in the traditional block-based hybrid coding framework, image partitioning and quantization steps inevitably introduce various forms of compression distortion, severely impacting video quality. Loop filtering techniques, by addressing compression artifacts generated during coding, significantly enhance the visual quality of reconstructed videos, thus holding a vital position in video coding standards. With the continual advancement of deep learning technologies, neural networks have augmented the understanding and processing capabilities towards video content, enabling loop filters to better adapt to encoding needs across different scenes and content types. Loop filtering techniques based on neural networks have demonstrated exceptional performance and broad application prospects in the field of video encoding. This paper focuses on \\"Neural Network-Based Loop Filtering Techniques,\\" exploring more efficient loop filtration methods from the perspectives of video content diversity, video encoding parameter characteristics, and video temporal dependency. The main innovations of this paper include: Firstly, a content-adaptive reinforcement learning-based in-loop filtering algorithm is proposed. Addressing the issue where current neural network-based in-loop filters often sacrifice complexity for enhanced model performance, this approach starts from the perspective of video content diversity, introducing a multi-complexity model adaptive decision method to effectively elevate encoding efficiency. Initially proposing a lightweight backbone network structure, experiments demonstrate that, in enhancing compressed image quality, more complex neural network models do not necessarily outperform simpler ones. Therefore, based on the lightweight network structure, an ensemble of models with varying complexities is formed. Moreover, considering the challenges in designing an appropriate loss function for direct supervision model training due to the need for extensive labeled data, this paper employs reinforcement learning to model loop filtering as a decision-making process, introducing a simple yet effective agent network to predict the optimal model from the ensemble, enhancing adaptability to various video content types. Results on the next-generation video coding standard VVC (Versatile Video Coding) reference software platform show that this method achieves an average of 2.51% encoding performance improvement under the random access configuration while better balancing model complexity and encoding performance. Secondly, a quantization parameter and frame-type adaptive in-loop filtering algorithm is proposed. Addressing the common issue in current neural network-based in-loop filters of training multiple networks for different quantization parameters and frame types, an efficient and flexible attention module is designed from the angle of encoding parameter characteristics, enabling the model to adapt to various quantization parameters or frame types. To ensure the continuous utilization of these rich-feature characteristics during the residual learning process, the proposed attention module is embedded into residual blocks, and a residual feature aggregation module is introduced for more efficient feature extraction. A focal mean square error loss function is employed to train the proposed network during the model training phase, mitigating the imbalance issue of training data across different quantization parameters and frame types. This approach enables a single model to effectively process reconstructed video frames with varying quantization parameters and frame types. Experiments on the VVC reference software platform show that this method achieves an average encoding performance improvement of 3.63%, 4.36%, 4.23%, and 3.56% under all intra coding, low-delay P, low-delay B, and random access configurations, respectively. Thirdly, an efficient out-of-loop filtering algorithm based on multi-frame reference is proposed. Facing the challenge of high complexity in utilizing temporal information of adjacent frames in current multi-frame reference out-of-loop filtering, an efficient deformable offset estimator is introduced from the perspective of feature correlation, allowing for coarse-to-fine estimation of offsets in lower resolution spaces, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining good performance. To fully exploit the prior knowledge reflecting the compression level, an efficient mapping feature transformation module is proposed, guiding feature learning to effectively utilize aligned visual features and quantization parameter representations. Experimental results indicate that this method can improve the average peak signal-to-noise ratio of compressed videos by 0.85 dB, with reduced complexity. In summary, this paper investigates neural network-based loop filtering algorithms, presenting a content-adaptive reinforcement learning in-loop filter from the perspective of video content diversity; a quantization parameter and frame-type adaptive in-loop filter from the angle of video coding parameter characteristics; and an efficient out-of-loop filter based on multi-frame reference from the aspect of temporal correlation. The methodologies introduced in this paper further enhance the quality of reconstructed videos, offering new ideas and methods for the development of intelligent video encoding."},{"instruction":"用js写一个mp4 web播放器","output":"创建一个简单的MP4视频播放器在Web页面上使用HTML和JavaScript是相对直接的。HTML5提供了`<video>`标签，使得在网页上嵌入视频变得非常简单。接下来，我将提供一种基本的方法来实现这一功能： # 第一步：HTML结构 首先，在你的HTML文件中，你需要定义一个`<video>`标签来承载视频内容。例如： ```html <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>简单MP4播放器</title> </head> <body> <video id=\\"videoPlayer\\" width=\\"720\\" controls> <source src=\\"your_video.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\"> 您的浏览器不支持视频标签。 </video> <script src=\\"videoScript.js\\"><\/script> </body> </html> ``` 在这个例子中，`<video>`标签有三个关键的属性： 1. `id`：一个唯一的标识符，以便在JavaScript中引用。 2. `width`：定义视频播放器的宽度。 3. `controls`：这个属性使浏览器提供的播放控件变得可用，允许用户控制视频的播放。 `<source>`标签定义了视频文件的来源（`src`）和文件的类型（`type`）。 # 第二步：引入JavaScript（Optional） 在大多数基本的使用场景中，直接使用HTML的`<video>`标签就已经足够了，因为它自带有控制播放、暂停等基本功能。但是，如果你想要添加一些自定义的行为（比如在视频播放完毕后自动播放下一个视频），你可以通过JavaScript来实现。 创建一个名为`videoScript.js`的文件，并在其中编写你的JS代码。例如，下面的脚本会在控制台中打印一条消息，每当视频播放结束时： ```javascript document.addEventListener(\'DOMContentLoaded\', function() { var videoPlayer = document.getElementById(\'videoPlayer\'); videoPlayer.onended = function() { console.log(\\"视频播放已结束.\\"); // 在这里可以添加更多行为，比如自动播放下一个视频等。 }; }); ``` 这段代码首先等待文档完全加载，然后获取到我们之前定义的视频播放器元素，并添加一个事件监听器来处理视频播放结束（`onended`）的事件。 # 结论 通过使用HTML5的`<video>`标签结合可选的JavaScript，你可以在你的网页上非常容易地嵌入和控制MP4视频文件的播放。对于更高级的功能和定制化的播放器UI，你可能需要引入外部的JavaScript库或者框架，比如Video.js等，但对于基础用途而言，上述方法已经足够。"},{"instruction":"用js写一个mp4 web播放器，要求将视频流送到wasm解码器解码","output":"要创建一个Web播放器，它通过JavaScript将视频流发送到WebAssembly（Wasm）解码器进行解码，需要进行几个步骤。这个过程比较复杂且高级，因为它涉及到在前端使用Wasm来处理视频流的解码任务。以下是一个概述，涵盖了整个过程的关键部分： # 1. 准备Wasm解码器 首先，你需要有一个可以用于视频解码的Wasm模块。根据你想要解码的视频格式（如H264、VP9等），这个模块可能需要从相应的C/C++解码库（例如FFmpeg）编译而来。 1. **获取或创建Wasm模块**：如果你没有现成的Wasm视频解码器，你需要从适当的C/C++库编译一个。这可能需要使用Emscripten或其他工具来完成。 2. **使Wasm模块可用**：将编译好的Wasm模块部署到你的Web服务器上，确保它可以被你的Web应用访问到。 # 2. 编写JavaScript播放器和Wasm交互代码 接下来，你需要编写JavaScript代码以加载Wasm模块，并将MP4视频流送入该模块进行解码。 HTML部分 ```html <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>Wasm视频解码器播放器</title> </head> <body> <canvas id=\\"videoCanvas\\"></canvas> <script src=\\"videoPlayer.js\\"><\/script> </body> </html> ``` 在这个例子中，我们使用`<canvas>`来显示解码后的视频帧。 JavaScript部分（videoPlayer.js） ```javascript const videoCanvas = document.getElementById(\'videoCanvas\'); const canvasContext = videoCanvas.getContext(\'2d\'); let wasmDecoder; const loadWasmDecoder = async () => { try { wasmDecoder = await WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch(\'wasmDecoderModule.wasm\')); // 初始化Wasm模块 wasmDecoder.instance.exports.init(); } catch (err) { console.error(\'加载Wasm解码器失败:\', err); } }; const decodeVideoFrame = (videoFrame) => { // 假设Wasm解码器有一个叫做 decodeFrame 的方法 const decodedFrame = wasmDecoder.instance.exports.decodeFrame(videoFrame); // 将解码的视频帧渲染到canvas上 // 注意：你需要自己处理帧数据到可渲染格式的转换 }; // 模拟从视频源获取视频帧 const fetchVideoFrames = () => { // 假设getVideoFrame是获取视频帧的函数 const videoFrame = getVideoFrame(); decodeVideoFrame(videoFrame); requestAnimationFrame(fetchVideoFrames); }; loadWasmDecoder().then(() => { // 开始从视频源接收视频帧进行解码和渲染 fetchVideoFrames(); }); ``` 这段代码大致展示了如何加载Wasm模块，从视频源提取帧，然后将这些帧发送到Wasm解码器进行解码，最后将解码的帧渲染到canvas上。 # 注意事项 1. **视频解码和帧渲染**：需要特定的逻辑将解码的帧数据转换为可以在canvas上渲染的格式。这通常意味着处理YUV到RGB的转换，并可能需要手动操作像素数据。 2. **性能和优化**：视频解码是一个资源密集型任务。使用Wasm可以提高性能，但是优化你的解码器和渲染管线是至关重要的，尤其是对于高分辨率和高帧率的视频内容。 3. **兼容性和测试**：确保在不同的浏览器和设备上测试你的播放器，以验证Wasm模块的兼容性。 结论 在Web上使用Wasm进行视频解码展示了Web技术的强大功能，但这是一个高级和复杂的项目，可能需要深入了解视频编码原理、Wasm、和JavaScript。上面的指南提供了一个起点，但实现一个完整功能的解决方案需要进一步研究和开发。"},{"instruction":"I bought proxy server.

CondaHTTPError: HTTP 000 CONNECTION FAILED for url","output":"When experiencing a `CondaHTTPError: HTTP 000 CONNECTION FAILED` error, it suggests that Conda couldn\'t connect to the server to fetch the necessary package metadata. This issue can stem from a variety of causes, such as network issues, firewall settings, proxy configurations, or problems with the Conda servers themselves. Here are steps you can follow to troubleshoot and potentially fix this error: # 1. Check Your Internet Connection Ensure that your internet connection is stable. You can try accessing other websites or use `ping` commands to check the connectivity. # 2. Update Conda Sometimes, the issue might be with the version of Conda you are using. Updating Conda to the latest version can potentially resolve the issue, as updates often include bug fixes and improvements. ```bash conda update conda ``` # 3. Check Conda Configuration Your Conda configuration can affect how Conda connects to the internet. Use the following command to check your current Conda configuration: ```bash conda config --show ``` Pay attention to settings like `ssl_verify`, `channels`, and any proxy settings (`proxy_servers`) if you\'re behind a corporate or institutional firewall. # 4. SSL Verification If there are SSL verification issues, you can temporarily disable SSL verification as a test: ```bash conda config --set ssl_verify false ``` **Note:** This is not recommended for long-term use due to security concerns. Use this only for troubleshooting. Remember to enable it again with `conda config --set ssl_verify true` after testing. # 5. Configure Proxies If you are behind a proxy, you may need to configure Conda to use your proxy settings: ```bash conda config --set proxy_servers.http http://<proxy_server>:<port> conda config --set proxy_servers.https https://<proxy_server>:<port> ``` Make sure to replace `<proxy_server>` and `<port>` with your actual proxy server address and port number. # 6. Try Different Channels Sometimes, the issue might be with a specific channel being unavailable. You can try adding different channels or using only the defaults to see if the issue persists: ```bash conda config --add channels defaults ``` # 7. Reset Conda Configuration As a last resort, you can reset your Conda configuration to its defaults: ```bash conda config --remove-key proxy_servers conda config --set ssl_verify true ``` Resetting the entire configuration can be done, but be cautious as this will remove all custom configurations: ```bash conda config --remove-key channels conda config --set show_channel_urls true ``` # 8. Test with a Minimal Command Try running a minimal Conda command to see if the issue persists. Sometimes, the problem could be related to a specific package or server: ```bash conda search numpy ``` If none of these steps work, consider checking the Conda GitHub issues or forums. The problem might be on their end, or there could be an ongoing issue affecting more users. Remember, if the problem relates to a corporate or institutional network, you may need to speak with your network administrator for assistance with the firewall or proxy settings."},{"instruction":"发展新能源是我国能源战略的重要举措。围绕高比例新能源大电网安全高效运行的世界性难题，先后主持/参与国家自然科学基金、国家重点研发、国家863等国家级项目15项（主持5项）、重大工程研发项目21项（主持6项），面向世界上首个±1100kV、首个100%清洁能源远距离外送直流特高压等重大工程新能源消纳及安全运行的迫切需求，带领团队开展高比例新能源接入大电网安全稳定的原创性基础理论研究，首创了电网电压支撑强度量化评估方法和体系，研发了世界首套5万节点级电网新能源接纳规模量化评估软件，首次研制了响应驱动的大电网安全稳定实时防控系统，有力保障了我国电网的绿色供电安全 获省部级/学协会科技奖励17项（一等奖13项），其中中国电力科学技术进步一等奖1项（2022年，排名3）、北京市科技进步一等奖1项（2021年，排名3）、中国电工技术学会科学技术一等奖3项（2021/2017/2015年，均排名3）；获授权发明专利36项，出版专著4部，发表SCI/EI论文109篇（SCI收录36篇），其中2篇（均为第一/通讯作者）分别获IEEE PES最佳论文奖（2021年）、中国电机工程学会优秀论文一等奖（2018年）；参与制定电力行业唯一全文强制性国家标准《电力系统安全稳定导则》等国家标准4项、行业标准1项。2017年入选中国科协青年人才托举工程、2018年入选中国电力优秀青年科技人才、2021年入选首批国网公司青年人才托举工程、中国电科院青年科学家（仅2人），改写为500字以内的主要事迹","output":"发展新能源是我国能源战略的重要举措。在解决高比例新能源大电网安全高效运行的世界性难题方面，我先后主持/参与了多个国家级项目，围绕世界上首个±1100kV、首个100%清洁能源远距离外送直流特高压等重大工程新能源消纳及安全运行需求，进行了原创性基础理论研究。我们首次提出了电网电压支撑强度量化评估方法和体系，研发了世界首套5万节点级电网新能源接纳规模量化评估软件，以及响应驱动的大电网安全稳定实时防控系统，有效保障了我国电网的绿色供电安全。 在科技奖励方面，我获得了17项省部级/学协会科技奖励，包括一等奖13项，其中中国电力科学技术进步一等奖、北京市科技进步一等奖、中国电工技术学会科学技术一等奖等。我还获得了36项发明专利授权，出版了4部专著，发表了109篇SCI/EI论文，其中两篇分别获得了IEEE PES最佳论文奖和中国电机工程学会优秀论文一等奖。此外，我还参与制定了多项国家标准和行业标准。 基于在新能源领域的突出贡献，我先后入选了中国科协青年人才托举工程、中国电力优秀青年科技人才、国网公司青年人才托举工程和中国电科院青年科学家等荣誉称号。通过持续努力和创新，我将继续为推动我国电网新能源接入的安全稳定做出更大贡献。"},{"instruction":"把我去掉","output":"发展新能源是我国能源战略的重要举措。在解决高比例新能源大电网安全高效运行的世界性难题方面，先后主持/参与了多个国家级项目，围绕世界上首个±1100kV、首个100%清洁能源远距离外送直流特高压等重大工程新能源消纳及安全运行需求，进行了原创性基础理论研究。首次提出了电网电压支撑强度量化评估方法和体系，研发了世界首套5万节点级电网新能源接纳规模量化评估软件，以及响应驱动的大电网安全稳定实时防控系统，有效保障了我国电网的绿色供电安全。 在科技奖励方面，获得了17项省部级/学协会科技奖励，包括一等奖13项，其中中国电力科学技术进步一等奖、北京市科技进步一等奖、中国电工技术学会科学技术一等奖等。还获得了36项发明专利授权，出版了4部专著，发表了109篇SCI/EI论文，其中两篇分别获得了IEEE PES最佳论文奖和中国电机工程学会优秀论文一等奖。此外，参与制定了多项国家标准和行业标准。 基于在新能源领域的突出贡献，先后入选了中国科协青年人才托举工程、中国电力优秀青年科技人才、国网公司青年人才托举工程和中国电科院青年科学家等荣誉称号。通过持续努力和创新，将继续为推动我国电网新能源接入的安全稳定做出更大贡献。"},{"instruction":"改为300字以内","output":"发展新能源是我国能源战略的重要举措。在解决高比例新能源大电网安全运行难题方面，我参与了多个国家级项目，围绕世界上首个100%清洁能源远距离外送直流特高压工程进行原创性研究。提出了电网电压支撑强度评估方法，研发了大电网安全稳定实时防控系统，确保电网绿色供电安全。获17项省部级科技奖励，36项发明专利授权，发表109篇SCI/EI论文，其中两篇获得IEEE PES最佳论文奖和中国电机工程学会优秀论文一等奖。制定了多项国家标准和行业标准。入选中国科协青年人才托举工程、中国电科院青年科学家等称号。将继续努力，为推动我国电网新能源接入的安全稳定贡献力量。"},{"instruction":"把我去掉","output":"发展新能源是我国能源战略的重要举措。在解决高比例新能源大电网安全运行难题方面，参与了多个国家级项目，围绕世界上首个100%清洁能源远距离外送直流特高压工程进行原创性研究。提出了电网电压支撑强度评估方法，研发了大电网安全稳定实时防控系统，确保电网绿色供电安全。获17项省部级科技奖励，36项发明专利授权，发表109篇SCI/EI论文，其中两篇获得IEEE PES最佳论文奖和中国电机工程学会优秀论文一等奖。制定了多项国家标准和行业标准。入选中国科协青年人才托举工程、中国电科院青年科学家等称号。将继续努力，为推动我国电网新能源接入的安全稳定贡献力量。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

How can I assist you today in making your content shine?✨"},{"instruction":"When it comes to writing content, two factors are crucial, “perplexity” and “burstiness”. Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter ones. Al sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following content I am going to ask you to create, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness.

Je me souviens encore de la première fois qu\'on m\'a confié la tâche d\'habiller mon petit neveu. Franchement, cela semblait aussi complexe que de déchiffrer un code secret. Entre les petits bras qui gigotent et les couches, on pourrait croire qu\'on entre dans une danse ancestrale dont seuls les bébés connaissent les pas. Mais voilà, l\'espoir brille toujours au bout du tunnel – grâce, notamment, à des ateliers personnalisés pour les parents. Imaginez un guide, tel un phare dans la nuit, qui éclaire votre chemin dans l\'apprentissage des soins de votre bout de chou. Ces sessions sont un peu comme avoir une carte lorsqu\'on navigue dans une ville inconnue, sauf que là, on apprend à interpréter les pleurs de bébé plutôt que de déchiffrer des symboles cryptiques. Des conseils pratiques, oh combien précieux, sont donnés : Comment tenir votre bébé en toute sécurité pendant le bain ? Quelle est la meilleure manière de lutter contre les coliques, ce fameux fléau des nuits blanches? Et, la perle rare, des astuces pour réussir l\'allaitement ou le choix du lait infantile. On parlera aussi de cette bénédiction qu\'est le sommeil, avec des techniques pour aider votre petit trésor à mieux dormir (et vous aussi, par la même occasion). Le partage d\'anecdotes personnelles y occupe une place de choix, transformant l\'atmosphère en celle d\'un café entre amis plutôt qu\'en un séminaire médical. On rit, on s\'émeut, et surtout, on apprend que, oui, au début, on tâtonne un peu tous. Les bébés ne viennent pas avec un manuel d\'instructions après tout. Et parfois, le soutien le plus précieux vient de ceux qui sont passés par là, armés de patience et d\'une bonne dose d\'humour. Alors, si l\'arrivée d\'un nouveau membre dans votre famille vous fait sentir comme si vous deviez désamorcer une bombe sans instructions, un atelier sur les soins bébé pourrait bien se révéler être cette douce caresse d\'assurance dont vous avez tant besoin.✨"},{"instruction":"Consultation : Développement de l\'Enfant (atelier personnalisé pour les parents)","output":"✨Plongeons dans l\'un des mystères les plus fascinants de l\'univers, un sujet qui pourrait rivaliser en complexité avec le dernier gadget technologique : le développement de l\'enfant. Ah, ce joyeux labyrinthe de premiers pas maladroits, de babillages qui semblent parfois former des dialectes anciens, et de ces éclairs de compréhension pure dans leurs yeux quand ils découvrent quelque chose de nouveau - c\'est un peu comme observer les premières lueurs de l\'aube. Orchestrer un atelier personnalisé pour les parents sur le développement de l\'enfant, c\'est un peu comme devenir le guide de ces explorateurs en herbe, s\'aventurant dans la forêt dense et inexplorée qu\'est la croissance et l\'apprentissage de leur progéniture. Imaginez un espace où l\'on décode ensemble les étapes cruciales du développement, où chaque question trouve une oreille attentive. Un lieu où l\'on démystifie les caprices, où l\'on comprend que derrière chaque \\"non!\\" catégorique se cache un enfant qui, en fait, apprend à tester ses limites et à affirmer son individualité. On y apprend le langage secret des enfants, comment leurs jeux apparemment simples sont en fait des missions d\'espionnage dans le monde gigantesque de la cognition et de la motricité. On découvre que chaque \\"pourquoi\\" est une porte ouverte vers un monde d\'émerveillement, où le ciel est une vaste étendue pour l\'imagination, pas juste un espace à survoler en avion. Dans ces ateliers, on partage des astuces pour nourrir ce développement, des livres à lire ensemble blottis dans un coin calme, des jeux qui stimulent plus que juste les rires. Et surtout, on crée une communauté - un réseau de soutien fait de parents tout aussi perplexes, émerveillés, et parfois dépassés que vous. Le développement de l\'enfant, avec ses hauts et ses bas, ses moments d\'éclat et ses périodes de silence, est une aventure extraordinaire. Et dans cet atelier, on vous donne non seulement une boussole mais aussi des jumelles pour mieux observer, comprendre et apprécier la beauté unique de ce voyage.✨"},{"instruction":"Consultation : alimentation de bébé (atelier personnalisé pour les parents)","output":"✨Ah, l\'alimentation de bébé, un sujet aussi vaste que l\'océan et par moments, tout aussi mystérieux. On se retrouve, parents, tel des marins naviguant sans boussole à travers les premières étapes culinaires de notre enfant. L\'atelier personnalisé pour les parents sur l’alimentation de bébé apparaît alors comme un phare dans la brume, offrant direction et réconfort. Imaginez un espace où le lait n\'est pas seulement un aliment, mais l\'elixir de croissance, où la purée n’est pas juste une mixture, mais un arc-en-ciel de saveurs à découvrir. Chaque aliment introduit est un continent à explorer, avec ses propres coutumes et ses merveilles cachées. Ces ateliers démystifient le passage de l’allaitement ou du biberon aux solides, un périple qui peut paraître intimidant. \\"Quand introduire les aliments solides? Purée ou morceaux? Allergies?\\" sont des questions qui résonnent dans le coeur de chaque parent comme les tambours d\'un rituel ancestral. Et là, au sein de l\'atelier, on cherche ensemble les réponses, guidés par des experts comme des chamanes de la nutrition infantile. C\'est un lieu où l\'on apprend l\'importance des textures, des couleurs, où chaque expérience alimentaire peut devenir une aventure. On y parle de légumes verts comme des trésors à découvrir, des fruits comme des joyaux de la couronne nutritionnelle. Des anecdotes croustillantes viennent pimenter les conseils pratiques, transformant ce voyage alimentaire en une quête pleine d\'humour et d\'amour. Dans cet atelier, on partage des recettes, des astuces pour les repas difficiles, et des stratégies pour que les diverses étapes de l’alimentation de bébé soient aussi nourrissantes pour l\'âme des parents que pour le corps de l\'enfant. Et ce, toujours avec une perspective de bienveillance, reconnaissant que chaque bébé (et chaque parent!) avance à son propre rythme, avec ses propres goûts et aversions. L\'introduction à l\'alimentation devient moins un casse-tête et plus une célébration des étapes du développement de votre enfant. Un atelier sur l’alimentation de bébé, c’est la promesse que, même si le voyage est sinueux, on ne navigue pas seul. Et surtout, que le but n\'est pas seulement de nourrir mais de découvrir, ensemble, le plaisir de manger.✨"},{"instruction":"Consultation : santé de la maman (atelier personnalisé pour les parents - pré-partum et postpartum)","output":"✨Dans le tourbillon d\'excitation et de préparation à l\'arrivée d\'un bébé, il est facile d\'oublier une vérité fondamentale : prendre soin de la santé de la maman est tout aussi crucial que de s\'occuper de celle du nouveau-né. L’atelier sur la santé de la maman, dédié aux phases pré-partum et postpartum, est conçu comme un havre de paix et de compréhension pour naviguer à travers ces eaux souvent tumultueuses. Ce voyage commence, bien sûr, avant même que bébé ne pointe le bout de son nez. La période pré-partum est une phase de transformations profondes - physiques, émotionnelles, et même spirituelles. D\'une certaine façon, c\'est la préparation à une renaissance personnelle, où la femme devient mère, avec tout ce que cela implique. L’atelier aborde des sujets essentiels, tels que les changements corporels, la nutrition optimale, les techniques de relaxation, et la gestion de l\'anxiété qui peut parfois frôler l\'ampleur d\'un tsunami. Après l’accouchement, l\'aventure se poursuit, mais avec de nouveaux défis à relever. La période postpartum est souvent décrite avec une honnêteté crue dans ces ateliers, dévoilant le spectre complet de l\'expérience maternelle, loin de l’idéalisation parfois véhiculée. On explore les sujets de la récupération physique, des émotions en montagnes russes, de l’allaitement (ou du choix de ne pas allaiter), et de la redécouverte de son propre corps. Mais c\'est aussi un espace où la solidarité féminine trouve son expression la plus pure. En partageant des histoires, des peurs, des joies, et des larmes, une communauté se tisse, offrant un filet de sécurité émotionnel. Des experts offrent des conseils, mais les véritables étoiles sont les mamans elles-mêmes, qui, dans leur vulnérabilité et leur force, rappellent à chacune qu’elle n’est pas seule. Rire, c\'est aussi une partie intégrante de ces ateliers. Parce que, avouons-le, il y a des jours où si l\'on ne rit pas, on pleurerait - comme lorsque l\'on découvre une trace de vomi sur son épaule juste avant une réunion importante, ou quand les hormones postpartum rendent une publicité pour des croquettes pour chien étonnamment émouvante. L’atelier sur la santé de la maman, en phases pré-partum et postpartum, c’est une bulle de ressourcement et de réassurance. C’est apprendre à accueillir chaque étape, chaque sentiment, comme une partie intégrante d’un voyage magnifique. C’est, en somme, prendre soin de celle qui est au cœur de la vie naissante, avec tendresse et compassion.✨"},{"instruction":"Дополни фразу вместо многоточия: Цифры и слова смешались как во сне ... ну и пусть","output":"Цифры и слова смешались как во сне, ну и пусть - становится только интересней!"},{"instruction":"Ещё 5 вариантов.

There are several possible causes of Cushing syndrome, including: 1. Adrenal tumors: Most cases of Cushing syndrome are caused by tumors in the adrenal glands, which can be either benign (adenomas) or malignant (carcinomas). These tumors produce cortisol in excess. 2. Pituitary adenoma: Another common cause of Cushing syndrome is a tumor in the pituitary gland, known as a pituitary adenoma, which stimulates the adrenal glands to produce excessive cortisol. 3. Ectopic ACTH production: In rare cases, Cushing syndrome may be caused by tumors outside the pituitary and adrenal glands that produce adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which in turn stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol. The clinical manifestations of Cushing syndrome can vary widely and may include: 1. Weight gain: Patients with Cushing syndrome often experience rapid weight gain, particularly in the abdomen, face, and neck. 2. High blood pressure: Elevated levels of cortisol can lead to high blood pressure (hypertension). 3. Muscle weakness: Weakness in the muscles, particularly in the arms and legs, is common in Cushing syndrome. 4. Skin changes: Patients may develop thin and fragile skin, stretch marks (striae), acne, and easy bruising. 5. Glucose intolerance: Elevated cortisol levels can lead to insulin resistance and high blood sugar levels, resulting in glucose intolerance and an increased risk of diabetes. 6. Osteoporosis: Chronic exposure to high cortisol levels can lead to bone loss and an increased risk of osteoporosis. 7. Mood changes: Patients with Cushing syndrome may experience depression, irritability, anxiety, and cognitive impairment. 8.

PAM 구성 파일은 `/etc/pam.d/` 디렉토리 내에 위치합니다. 특히 `/etc/pam.d/common-password` 파일에 있는 설정을 확인하는 것이 좋습니다. 4. **잘못된 `/etc/shadow` 파일 권한**: `/etc/shadow` 파일은 비밀번호 정보를 저장하는 파일로, 이 파일의 권한이 잘못 설정되었을 수 있습니다. 일반적으로 이 파일은 `root` 사용자만 읽고 쓸 수 있어야 합니다. 5. **SELinux(AppArmor) 문제**: SELinux 또는 AppArmor와 같은 보안 모듈이 비밀번호 변경 과정을 차단하는 정책을 가지고 있을 수 있습니다. 6. **임시 파일 생성 오류**: `passwd` 명령은 비밀번호를 변경하는 과정에서 임시 파일을 생성할 수도 있는데, `/tmp` 디렉토리가 가득 차 있거나, 쓰기 권한이 없는 경우 오류가 발생할 수 있습니다. 이러한 문제를 해결하기 위한 일반적인 접근 방법은 다음과 같습니다: - 파일 시스템이 읽기 전용인지 확인하고 필요한 경우 수정합니다. - 파일 시스템의 무결성을 검사하고 오류를 수정합니다. - PAM 설정을 확인하고 잘못된 구성이 있는지 검토합니다. - `/etc/shadow` 파일의 권한을 확인하고 필요한 경우 수정합니다 (`sudo chmod 640 /etc/shadow`). - SELinux 또는 AppArmor의 로그를 확인하여 정책 차단이 있는지 확인합니다. - `/tmp` 디렉토리의 상태를 확인하고, 필요한 경우 정리합니다. 위의 조치들 중 하나로 문제를 해결할 수 있으며, 이러한 단계를 거쳐도 문제가 해결되지 않는다면 시스템 로그에서 더 자세한 오류 메시지를 찾아보는 것이 도움이 될 수 있습니다."},{"instruction":"root로 변경 시 문제점","output":"시스템에서 작업을 수행할 때 `root` 사용자로 변경하여 작업하는 것은 여러 가지 문제를 야기할 수 있습니다. `root` 사용자는 리눅스 시스템에서 가장 강력한 권한을 가지고 있기 때문에, 이 사용자로 작업할 때는 특별한 주의가 필요합니다. 다음은 `root`로 변경하여 작업할 때 발생할 수 있는 몇 가지 주요 문제점입니다: 1. **보안 취약성**: `root` 사용자는 모든 파일에 대한 접근 권한과 시스템 설정을 변경할 수 있는 권한을 가지고 있습니다. 만약 해커가 `root` 권한을 획득한다면, 시스템에 대한 완전한 제어권을 얻게 되어 시스템 안전에 큰 위험을 초래할 수 있습니다. 2. **시스템 손상**: `root` 권한으로는 중요한 시스템 파일을 실수로 삭제하거나 수정할 위험이 높아집니다. 심각한 경우 시스템이 부팅되지 않거나 중요한 데이터를 복구할 수 없는 상태가 될 수 있습니다. 3. **설정 변경 오류**: `root` 사용자는 시스템 설정을 변경할 수 있습니다. 잘못된 설정은 시스템의 보안 취약성을 높이거나, 시스템 성능을 저하시킬 수 있습니다. 4. **보안 정책 위반**: 많은 조직에서는 보안 정책으로 일반 작업에 `root` 계정 사용을 금지하고 있습니다. `root` 권한으로의 무분별한 접근은 이러한 정책을 위반하는 것으로, 관리적인 문제를 초래할 수 있습니다. 5. **감사 추적 어려움**: 여러 관리자가 `root` 계정을 공유하여 사용할 경우, 각 관리자의 행동을 추적하기 어렵습니다. 이로 인해 보안 문제 발생 시 문제의 원인을 파악하는데 어려움을 겪을 수 있습니다. 이러한 문제를 회피하기 위해, 다음과 같은 안전 대책을 사용할 수 있습니다: - **sudo 사용**: `sudo` 명령어를 사용하면 일반 사용자가 `root` 권한이 필요한 명령어를 실행할 수 있습니다. `sudo`는 감사 로그에 실행된 명령어를 기록하여 어떤 사용자가 어떤 명령어를 실행했는지 추적할 수 있게 해 줍니다. - **최소 권한 원칙**: 가능한 한 `root` 권한이 필요하지 않은 계정으로 작업하고, `root` 권한이 필요한 경우에만 `sudo`를 사용하여 필요한 명령어만 실행하는 것이 좋습니다. - **접근 제어 및 감사 정책 적용**: `root` 접근을 필요로 하는 작업에 대해 철저한 접근 제어 및 감사 정책을 수립하고, 이를 엄격히 적용해야 합니다. 이러한 원칙을 지키면서 시스템 관리를 진행하면 보안 사고의 위험을 줄이면서도 필요한 관리 작업을 수행할 수 있습니다."},{"instruction":"chage -M 90 -W 10 cloudium 취소","output":"`chage` 명령어를 사용하여 사용자 `cloudium`의 패스워드 만료 정책을 설정했다면, 설정된 정책을 취소하려면 비밀번호 만료를 비활성화하거나 기본값으로 재설정해야 합니다. `chage -M 90 -W 10 cloudium` 명령은 `cloudium` 사용자의 비밀번호 만료 기간을 90일로, 비밀번호 만료 10일 전에 경고를 보내도록 설정합니다. 이 설정을 취소하고 싶다면, 두 가지 접근 방식이 있습니다: 1. **비밀번호 만료를 무기한으로 설정**: 이것은 패스워드 만료 정책을 \\"비활성화\\"하는 것과 같습니다. 이를 위해서는 `-M` 옵션에 `99999`를 사용하면 됩니다 (리눅스 시스템에서 \'99999\'는 패스워드가 만료되지 않음을 나타내는 공통적인 방법입니다). ```shell chage -M 99999 cloudium ``` 2. **비밀번호 변경 경고를 비활성화**: `-W` 옵션을 사용하여 경고 기간을 `0`으로 설정할 수 있습니다. ```shell chage -W 0 cloudium ``` 위의 명령들은 각각 비밀번호 만료 일자와 비밀번호 만료 경고를 기본값 또는 특정 조건에 맞게 조정합니다. 만약 둘 다 \\"기본 설정\\"으로 되돌리고 싶다면, 시스템이나 조직의 정책에 따라 기본 설정이 무엇인지 알아야 합니다. 특정 \\"기본값\\"으로 설정하는 명령어 옵션은 없으며, 기본 설정은 시스템 설정이나 관리자가 정한 정책에 따라 다릅니다. 만일 이전 설정을 정확히 알고 있다면, 해당 값으로 다시 설정할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 만일 기본 비밀번호 만료 기간이 60일이었다면, 다음과 같은 명령을 사용할 수 있습니다: ```shell chage -M 60 cloudium ``` 그러나, 대부분의 경우 \\"취소\\"라는 것은 단순히 패스워드 만료 정책을 무기한 또는 사용하지 않는 설정으로 바꾸는 것을 의미합니다. 사용자 패스워드 정책을 확인하고 변경하는 작업은 주의를 요하기 때문에, 이러한 변경을 시행하기 전에 조직 내의 보안 정책과 지침을 확인하는 것이 좋습니다."},{"instruction":"Last password change : Jul 26, 2022 Password expires : never Password inactive : never Account expires : never Minimum number of days between password change : 0 Maximum number of days between password change : 99999 Number of days of warning before password expires : 0 뜻","output":"이 정보는 `chage` 명령어를 사용하여 특정 사용자(이 경우에는 질문에서는 언급되지 않았습니다)의 비밀번호 및 계정 만료 정책에 대한 세부 사항을 보여줍니다. 각 항목의 뜻은 다음과 같습니다: 1. **Last password change (마지막 비밀번호 변경)**: \\"Jul 26, 2022\\"는 사용자가 마지막으로 비밀번호를 변경한 날짜입니다. 이 정보를 통해 사용자의 비밀번호 변경 주기를 관리하거나, 얼마나 자주 비밀번호를 바꾸는지 확인할 수 있습니다. 2. **Password expires (비밀번호 만료)**: \\"never\\"는 사용자의 비밀번호가 만료되지 않음을 의미합니다. 즉, 사용자는 비밀번호를 변경하라는 통지를 받지 않으며, 현재 설정된 비밀번호를 계속 사용할 수 있습니다. 3. **Password inactive (비밀번호 비활성화)**: \\"never\\"는 비밀번호가 만료된 후에도 계정이 비활성화되지 않음을 의미합니다. 일부 시스템에서는 비밀번호가 만료된 후 일정 기간이 지나면 계정을 비활성화할 수 있습니다. 4. **Account expires (계정 만료)**: \\"never\\"는 계정 자체가 특정 기간 후에 만료되거나 비활성화되지 않음을 의미합니다. 사용자 계정은 계속 활성 상태로 유지됩니다. 5. **Minimum number of days between password change (비밀번호 변경 사이의 최소 일수)**: \\"0\\"은 사용자가 비밀번호를 얼마나 자주 변경할 수 있는지에 대한 제한이 없음을 의미합니다. 즉, 사용자는 필요한 경우 비밀번호를 연속해서 여러 번 변경할 수 있습니다. 6. **Maximum number of days between password change (비밀번호 변경 사이의 최대 일수)**: \\"99999\\"는 사용자가 비밀번호를 변경하기까지 허용되는 최대 일수입니다. 이 숫자는 일반적으로 비밀번호가 사실상 만료되지 않도록 설정될 때 사용됩니다. 7. **Number of days of warning before password expires (비밀번호 만료 전 경고 일수)**: \\"0\\"은 사용자가 비밀번호 만료 전에 경고를 받지 않음을 의미합니다. 만약 비밀번호 만료가 설정되어 있지 않다면, 이 설정은 적용되지 않습니다. 이 설정들은 시스템 관리자가 사용자 계정의 보안과 편의성을 관리하기 위해 조정할 수 있는 다양한 옵션입니다. 보안 요구 사항이나 조직의 정책에 따라 이러한 값들은 변경될 수 있습니다."},{"instruction":"GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES on DestinyECM.* to \'ghostone\'@\'%\' identified by \'ghostone\';

This customization is aimed at not only providing an authentication token for a user but also fetching and returning additional user-specific data as part of the authentication response. Below is a breakdown of what the code does: 1. **Override the `post` method**: The `post` method is overridden here to define custom behavior when the API endpoint associated with this class is accessed using the HTTP POST method. This is typically when a client sends a request for authentication. 2. **User Authentication**: The `serializer` object is created by passing the request data and context (including the request object itself) to check if the provided credentials (username and password) are valid. If the credentials are invalid, the `serializer.is_valid(raise_exception=True)` call will raise an exception and return an error response. If they are valid, it proceeds to find or create an authentication token associated with the user. 3. **Fetching User-specific Data**: - The code then tries to fetch JSON data associated with the user from the `UserJsonData` model. If there is an entry for the user, it retrieves this JSON data; otherwise, it defaults to an empty string. - Additionally, it fetches the user\'s test level data from the `leveldata` model, selecting the latest entry based on `testNo` (assuming this represents some sort of test number or level) to find the max test number the user has reached. If there is no such data, it defaults this value to `0`. 4. **Building Response Data**: It constructs a response dictionary `res` that contains: - The authentication token (`token.key`), - The user\'s ID (`user.pk`), - The user\'s username (`user.username`), - The JSON data fetched earlier (`jsonData`), - The maximum test number or level (`max_testNo`). 5. **Logging and Response**: Then, it prints the response dictionary `res` to the console (which is usually for debugging purposes) and returns this data wrapped in a `Response` object to the client. This effectively sends all the included user information and authentication token back to the requesting client. In essence, this code extends a basic token authentication mechanism to also provide client applications with additional user-specific data (like JSON data and test number) upon successful authentication, which can be particularly useful in applications where just the authentication token is not enough and more context about the authenticated user is required immediately after login."},{"instruction":"@api_view([\'POST\']) @authentication_classes([TokenAuthentication]) @permission_classes([IsAuthenticated]) def upload(request): user = request.user postData = request.POST # print(\\"~~~~~ postData: \\", postData[\'leveldata\']) if (len(postData[\'leveldata\']) == 0): # print(\\"upload: Empty form data\\") return Response({\'message\': \\"No data\\", \\"isConflict\\": False}) try: # if json data does not exist yet - needs checking if len(UserJsonData.objects.filter(user=request.user)[0].jsonData) == 0: jsonMaxCurrent = 0 else: jsonMaxCurrent = json.loads(UserJsonData.objects.filter(user=request.user)[0].jsonData)[\'maxCurrent\'] levelDataTestNo = [r.split(\\"t\\")[2] for r in filter(None, postData[\'leveldata\'].split(\\"n\\"))] minLDTestNo, maxLDTestNo = min(levelDataTestNo), max(levelDataTestNo) minLDTestNo = int(minLDTestNo) maxLDTestNo = int(maxLDTestNo) jsonMaxCurrent = int(jsonMaxCurrent) print(f\\"{minLDTestNo=}, {maxLDTestNo=}, {jsonMaxCurrent=}\\") if (minLDTestNo <= jsonMaxCurrent): print(\\"upload: Conflict\\") entry = Conflict_Data_Serializer(data={\\"user\\": user.id ,\\"time\\": datetime.now().isoformat(), \\"data\\": json.dumps(postData)}) if entry.is_valid(): entry.save() else: print(request.user) print(f\\"{entry.data}n{entry.errors}\\") return Response({\'message\': \\"upload into conflict data success\\", \\"isConflict\\": True}) # old code # for k, v in modelTable.items(): # if k in postData.keys(): # print(f\\"{k}:n{postData[k]}\\") # for r in filter(None, postData[k].split(\\"n\\")): # # print(getFieldNames(v[\\"model\\"])) # if k == \\"leveldata\\": # rData = {v[\\"model\\"].getFieldNames()[j]: c.strip() for j, c in enumerate(list(filter(None, r.split(\\"t\\"))))} # rData[\\"user\\"] = user.pk # prev = leveldata.objects.filter(user=rData[\\"user\\"], testNo=rData[\\"testNo\\"]) # else: # rData = {getFieldNames(v[\\"model\\"])[j]: c.strip() for j, c in enumerate(list(filter(None, r.split(\\"t\\"))))} # try: # rData[\\"leveldata\\"] = leveldata.objects.get(user=user, testNo=rData[\\"leveldata\\"]).pk # prev = v[\\"model\\"].objects.filter(internalNo=rData[\\"internalNo\\"], leveldata=rData[\\"leveldata\\"]) # except Exception as e: # exceptionEntry = Exception_Data_Serializer(data={\\"time\\": datetime.now().isoformat(), \\"tableName\\": k, \\"entryData\\": json.dumps(rData), \\"exceptions\\": str(e)}) # if exceptionEntry.is_valid(): # exceptionEntry.save() # else: # print(\\"Model \\"Exception_Data\\" Error 1\\") # print(request.user) # print(f\\"{exceptionEntry.data}n{exceptionEntry.errors}\\") # if len(prev) > 0: # entry = v[\\"serializer\\"](prev, data=rData) # else: # entry = v[\\"serializer\\"](data=rData) # # test Exception_Data # # entry = v[\\"serializer\\"](data={\\"Test Exceptions\\": \\"Exception\\"}) # if entry.is_valid(): # entry.save() # else: # print(request.user) # exceptionEntry = Exception_Data_Serializer(data={\\"time\\": datetime.now().isoformat(), \\"tableName\\": k, \\"entryData\\": json.dumps(rData), \\"exceptions\\": json.dumps(entry.errors)}) # if exceptionEntry.is_valid(): # exceptionEntry.save() # else: # print(\\"Model \\"Exception_Data\\" Error 2\\") # print(f\\"{exceptionEntry.data}n{exceptionEntry.errors}\\") # print(f\\"{rData}n{entry.errors}\\") # return Response({\'message\': \\"upload data success\\", \\"isConflict\\": False}) # old code end # new code - under construction LD_override, override_log= {}, [] for tableName, tableValue in modelTable.items(): if tableName in postData.keys(): print(f\\"{tableName}:n{postData[tableName]}\\") for row in filter(None, postData[tableName].split(\\"n\\")): # print(getFieldNames(v[\\"model\\"])) # print(\\"row is\\", row) if tableName == \\"leveldata\\": # LD_override, override_log= {}, [] # original position rData = {tableValue[\\"model\\"].getFieldNames()[index]: column.strip() for index, column in enumerate(list(filter(None, row.split(\\"t\\"))))} rData[\\"user\\"] = user.pk prev = leveldata.objects.filter(user=rData[\\"user\\"], testNo=rData[\\"testNo\\"]) allPrev = leveldata.objects.filter(user=rData[\\"user\\"]) # list of all previous entries if len(allPrev) == 0: # played for the first time so len(allPrev) = 0 # current max testNo in server\'s database serverDBMaxTestNo = 0 # to avoid negative indexing else: serverDBMaxTestNo = getattr(allPrev[len(allPrev)-1],\\"testNo\\") # will allPrev always contain 1..max?

The code defines a view function named `upload`, which processes POST requests containing user-generated data. It encompasses various functionalities, including input validation, conflict detection, and data serialization for storage. Here\'s a detailed breakdown of what this intricate script accomplishes: # Initial Setup 1. **Authentication and Permissions**: The `upload` function is decorated with `@api_view([\'POST\'])`, indicating it only accepts POST requests. The `@authentication_classes([TokenAuthentication])` and `@permission_classes([IsAuthenticated])` decorators ensure that only authenticated users, possessing a valid token, can access this endpoint. # Data Processing and Validation 2. **Request and Data Extraction**: The function extracts the user object from the request and the posted data. It verifies if the `leveldata`, a key component of the POST data, exists and if it is not empty. 3. **JSON Data Handling**: It assesses whether the authenticated user has associated JSON data (`UserJsonData`). If JSON data exists, it retrieves a specific value (`jsonMaxCurrent`) from it for comparison purposes. 4. **Data Parsing and Validation**: The script parses the `leveldata` from the POST data, splitting it into rows and extracting a `testNo` value from each row. It determines the range of test number values submitted and evaluates these against `jsonMaxCurrent` to detect potential data conflicts. # Conflict Detection and Data Handling 5. **Conflict Resolution**: Should any of the submitted test numbers precede or match `jsonMaxCurrent`, indicating a potential overlap with existing data, the code marks the submission as a conflict. It serializes the conflicting data (including appending a timestamp) and stores it, possibly for later resolution. # Data Serialization and Storage 6. **Dynamic Model Handling**: The core of the script involves iterating over a dictionary (`modelTable`) which seemingly maps form field names to Django model classes and serializers. For each relevant piece of POST data: - It validates whether the submitted data represents new or existing entries by querying the database based on identifiers like `testNo` and `internalNo`. - The script checks for duplicates or generates new test numbers if necessary to avoid overwriting existing records. - It then attempts to serialize and save the validated data. Serialization involves converting the structured data into a format suitable for storage in a Django model. This step incorporates extensive error handling, including logging serialization errors for analysis and debugging. 7. **Exception Handling**: Encapsulated in a try-except block, the function is equipped to catch and log any unforeseen exceptions that might occur during the execution, ensuring that any error does not result in a server crash and is instead gracefully reported. # Response Generation 8. **Returning a Response**: Lastly, assuming all operations are successful and there are no conflicts or exceptions, the function returns a success message to the sender. If there was a conflict detected in the processed data, it informs the client about this state. # Conclusion This function is designed to handle complex data uploads in a scenario where preserving data integrity and order is critical—such as a learning management system or a platform where users\' progress through various levels is tracked. It demonstrates sophisticated error handling, data validation, and conflict resolution strategies appropriate for applications that deal with concurrent user interactions and asynchronous data submissions."},{"instruction":"was that code clean rate it out of 10","output":"Rating the provided code snippet for cleanliness is subjective and depends on several factors including readability, maintainability, adherence to best practices, and overall structure. Here\'s a breakdown on several aspects to consider: 1. **Readability and Structure (5/10)**: The code, while functional, suffers from readability issues due to its length, deeply nested conditional logic, and comments that seem to indicate sections of old and new code, without clear delineation. Structurally, breaking down the function into smaller, more focused functions could significantly enhance readability and maintainability. 2. **Adherence to Best Practices (6/10)**: The code uses decorators appropriately for authentication and permissions, and properly leverages Django\'s ORM for data access and manipulation. However, the way it handles conflict detection and data serialization could be streamlined. Use of raw print statements for debugging and the lack of clear error messages or logging also detract from best practices. 3. **Error Handling (7/10)**: The script includes a try-except block covering a large portion of the code, which is good for catching and handling unexpected errors. However, the error handling could be more granular, especially in data validation and serialization sections, to provide more informative responses to the client. 4. **Efficiency and Performance (5/10)**: The script performs multiple queries to the database, some of which could potentially be optimized or reduced. For instance, repeated filtering operations on `UserJsonData` and `leveldata` could be minimized. The conflict detection mechanism might also be more efficiently implemented to avoid unnecessary processing. 5. **Maintainability (4/10)**: The high-level complexity, coupled with sections of commented-out \\"old code\\" and under-construction \\"new code,\\" suggests that maintaining and updating this script could be challenging. Proper version control and phasing out obsolete blocks of code would aid maintainability. 6. **Use of Comments (6/10)**: While the code contains comments, their utility varies throughout the script. Some comments provide useful context or signify sections of code undergoing work, but others are more ambiguous, leaving room for confusion about the code\'s intention or state of completion. Overall, considering these factors, the code snippet might be rated around **5.6/10** on cleanliness. Improvements could include enhancing readability by restructuring the code into smaller functions, improving error handling with more specific catch blocks, adhering more closely to Python and Django best practices, refining database interactions for performance, and cleaning up commented and debug code for maintainability."},{"instruction":"teach me how to write clean code","output":"Writing clean code is a fundamental skill in software development that enhances readability, maintainability, and overall quality of the codebase. Here are principles and best practices you can follow to write cleaner code: # 1. **Follow a Naming Convention** - **Use Meaningful and Descriptive Names**: Choose names that reveal intent. For variables, functions, and classes, use names that clearly describe what they do, what they represent, or the value they hold. - **Be Consistent**: Follow the naming conventions of the language you\'re using (e.g., `camelCase` for JavaScript, `snake_case` for Python) and be consistent in your project. # 2. **Keep Functions Small and Focused** - **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each function or method should do one thing and do it well. Aim for functions that are short, with a clear purpose. If a function is doing too much, consider breaking it down into smaller functions. - **Limit Parameters**: Too many parameters can make functions complicated and hard to use. Aim for a few parameters per function. Consider using objects if you have too many parameters. # 3. **Write Readable Code** - **Use Whitespace**: Proper use of whitespace, line breaks, and indentation makes code easier to read and understand. - **Avoid Deep Nesting**: Deeply nested loops and conditionals can make code hard to follow. Try to limit nesting; flattening logic where possible, using guard clauses, or breaking down complex functions. # 4. **Write Comments Wisely** - **Explain Why, Not What**: Good comments explain why certain decisions were made or clarify complex parts of the code. Avoid comments that simply reiterate what the code does. - **Keep Comments Updated**: Ensure that comments are updated alongside the code they describe. Stale comments can be misleading and worse than no comments at all. # 5. **Use Meaningful Error Handling** - **Be Explicit**: Catch specific exceptions rather than generic ones. This helps in pinpointing issues and handling them appropriately. - **Provide Context in Messages**: Error messages should be descriptive enough to give a clear understanding of what went wrong and possibly how to address it. # 6. **Refactor Ruthlessly** - **Improve Existing Code**: Continuously look for opportunities to simplify and improve the code without changing its behavior. This includes removing duplicate code, using more descriptive names, and reducing complexity. - **Review Code with Peers**: Code reviews are a powerful tool for ensuring code quality and consistency. They provide an opportunity for feedback and improvement. # 7. **Adhere to Established Patterns and Principles** - **Design Patterns**: Familiarize yourself with common design patterns in your programming language or domain. These patterns are solutions to common problems and can help in writing well-structured, reliable code. - **SOLID Principles**: If you’re working with object-oriented programming, adhering to SOLID principles can significantly enhance the quality of your code. These principles encourage modular, flexible, and maintainable code design. # 8. **Automate Where Possible** - **Code Formatting Tools**: Use tools like Prettier, Black, or ESLint to automatically format your code according to a predefined set of rules. This helps maintain consistency across the codebase. - **Static Analysis**: Tools that analyze code for potential errors, code smells, or stylisitic issues can help catch problems early. # 9. **Learn and Adapt** - **Keep Learning**: Best practices and standards evolve. Stay up-to-date with the latest recommendations, tools, and techniques. - **Be Open to Feedback**: Constructive criticism from code reviews, pair programming, or mentorship is invaluable for growth. Clean code is as much about the mindset as it is about techniques. Writing clean code requires practice, patience, and reflection. Always aim to leave the codebase a little better than you found it."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Напиши сочинение на эту тему по тексту - (1)В дождливый летний день я подходил к Светлому озеру, к знакомому сторожу на рыбачьей стоянке Тарасу. (2)Избушка оказалась пустой. (3)Хозяина не было, он, вероятно, отправился на озеро осматривать какую-нибудь рыболовную снасть. (4)Когда Соболько радостно взвизгнул, я понял, что он завидел хозяина. (5)Действительно, в протоке черной точкой показалась рыбачья лодка, огибавшая остров. (6)Этои был Тарас. (7)Он плыл, стоя на ногах, и ловко управлял одним веслом.: (8)Когда он подплыл ближе, я заметил, к удивлению, плывшего перед лодкой лебедя. - (9)Ступай домой, гуляка! - ворчал старик, подгоняя красиво плывшую птицу. (10)Лебедь красиво подплыл, вышел на берег, встряхнулся и, тяжело переваливаясь на своих кривых чёрных ногах, направился к избушке. (11)СтарикТарас был высокого роста, с окладистой седой бородой. (12)Он всё лето ходил босой и без шляпы. (13) 3агорелое широкое лицо было изборождено глубокими морщинами. (14)Серые глаза его светились добротой. - (15)3дравствуй, Тарас! - (16)3дравствуй, барин! - (17)Откудапуть держишь? - (18)А вот за Приёмышем плавал, за лебедем. (19)Всё тут вертелся в протоке, а потом вдруг и пропал. (20)Ну, я сейчас за ним. (21)Выехал в озеро - нет; по заводям проплыл - нет. (22)Аон за островом плавает. - (23)Откуда достал-то его, лебедя? - (24)А бог послал, да! (25)Охотники лебедя с лебёдушкой пристрелили, а вот этот остался. (26)3абился в камыши и сидит. (27)Летать-то не умеет, вот и спрятался. (28)Я его поймал, чтобы ястребы не заели. (29)Пропадёт один-то. (30)Сиротой остался. (31)Не возьму я в толк, зачем охотники лебедей застрелили. (32)Ведь и есть не станут, а так, для озорства. (33)Вот я его привёз и держу. (34)И он тоже привык. (35)Теперь вот скоро месяц будет, как живём вместе. (36)Утром на заре поднимается, поплавает в протоке, покормится, потом и домой. (37)Он знает, когда я встаю, и ждёт, чтобы покормили.(38)Умная птица, одним словом, и свой порядок знает. (39)Старик говорил необыкновенно любовно, как о близком человеке. (40)Лебедь приковылял к самой избушке и, очевидно, выжидал какой-нибудь подачки. (41)Лебедь точно понимал слова старика и посматривал на него своими умными глазами. - (42)А как он с Собольком? - спросил я. - (43)Сперва-то боялся, а потом привык. (44)Теперь лебедь-то в другой раз у Соболька и кусок отнимает. (45)Пёс заворчит на него, а лебедь его - крылом. (46)Смешно на них со стороны смотреть. (47)А то гулять вместе отправляются: лебедь по воде, а Соболько по берегу. (48)Пробовал пёс плавать за ним, да ремесло-то не то: чуть не потонул. (49)А как лебедь уплывёт, Соболько ищет его. (50)Сядет на бережку и воет. (51)Дескать, скучно мне, псу, без тебя, друг. (52)Так вот и живём втроём. (53)Вот и сейчас они разыгрались, посмотри-ка. (54)Действительно, стоило полюбоваться оригинальной картиной: лебедь стоял, раскрыв крылья, а Соболько с визгом и лаем нападал на него. (55)Умная птица вытягивала шею и шипела на собаку, как это делают гуси. (56)Старый Тарас от души смеялся над этой сценой, как ребёнок. ДОЛЖНО быть два аргумента и к каждому анализ и микровывод. Аргументы должны отвечать на вопрос этого сочинения","output":"Доброе отношение к природе может стать источником истинного счастья и удовлетворения для человека. Это утверждение находит подтверждение в рассказе о взаимоотношениях старика Тараса с природой, а особенно с одним особенным лебедем, который стал его другом и спутником. Первый аргумент демонстрирует, как близость и гармония с природой обогащают внутренний мир человека и приносят ему радость. Примером этого является отношение Тараса к спасенному им лебедю. Старик спас птицу после того, как охотники убили ее спутника и, по сути, подарил ей второй шанс на жизнь (строки 24-29). Тарас не только заботится о лебеде, но и строит с ним доверительные, почти семейные отношения. Это чувство ответственности перед живым существом и его благополучием существенно укрепляет эмоциональную связь старика с природным миром, делая его жизнь более насыщенной и счастливой. Микровывод: забота о природе и живых существах способна наполнить сердце радостью и умиротворением, подтверждая значимость добрых отношений с окружающим миром для душевного спокойствия. Второй аргумент заключается в том, что дружба с природой позволяет человеку чувствовать себя нужным и важным, укрепляя его самооценку и внося смысл в повседневную жизнь. Отношения Тараса с лебедем и их совместная жизнь иллюстрируют это явление (строки 34-38). Лебедь, ждущий Тараса и взаимодействующий с ним, как друг, а также забавное взаимодействие с собакой, показывает, что природа способна отвечать на добро заботой и привязанностью. Такой обмен позитивным опытом между человеком и природой усиливает ощущение собственной значимости и позитивного влияния на окружающий мир. Микровывод: глубокие и заботливые отношения с природой обогащают жизнь, принося счастье через осознание собственной роли в сохранении и защите живых существ. Таким образом, доброе и заботливое отношение к природе не только способствует сохранению и укреплению природного мира, но и становится источником глубокого душевного удовлетворения и счастья для человека. История Тараса и его лебедя подтверждает, что любовь и уважение к природе обогащают человеческую жизнь, делая ее более полной и смысловой."},{"instruction":"тема почему нужно хорошо относиться к животным? давай так же","output":"Хорошее отношение к животным является не просто проявлением человечности и сочувствия, но также способствует развитию и поддержанию более гармоничного и здорового общества. В этом аспекте можно выделить несколько ключевых причин, по которым важно относиться к животным с любовью и уважением. Первая причина заключается в развитии эмпатии и ответственности. Уход и забота о животных учат человека состраданию и способности разделять чувства других существ. Взаимодействие с животными способствует формированию у детей и взрослых чувства ответственности, поскольку за каждое доверенное ими существо приходится нести ответственность, что делает людей более зрелыми и внимательными к потребностям других. Микровывод: воспитание эмпатии и ответственности через хорошее отношение к животным формирует более чуткие и доброжелательные личности. Вторая причина связана с сохранением биоразнообразия и устойчивым развитием нашей планеты. Каждое животное играет важную роль в экосистеме, и их исчезновение или ухудшение условий жизни может привести к непредсказуемым последствиям для всей природной среды, в том числе для человека. Отношение к животным с уважением и заботой подтверждает признание их важности для поддержания экологического равновесия и здоровья планеты. Микровывод: забота о животных способствует поддержанию биоразнообразия и устойчивому развитию, что делает это направление важным не только для самих животных, но и для будущего всей планеты. Третья причина, по которой нужно хорошо относиться к животным, заключается в положительном влиянии на физическое и психологическое здоровье человека. Тесная связь и дружба с животными доказали свою способность снижать уровень стресса, улучшать настроение и даже повышать физическую активность своих хозяев. Животные становятся не просто питомцами, но источниками поддержки, помогая людям справляться с депрессией, одиночеством и другими эмоциональными проблемами. Микровывод: положительное взаимодействие с животными может значительно улучшить качество жизни человека, способствуя его физическому и эмоциональному благополучию. В заключение, хорошее отношение к животным не является просто моральным выбором, но и важным элементом развития здорового общества, защиты природы и повышения качества жизни людей. Оно способствует развитию сострадательности, поддерживает биоразнообразие и приносит пользу психологическому и физическому здоровью, демонстрируя, что забота о животных ведет к гармонии и благополучию всего живого на нашей планете."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Какая комиссия на размещение ордеров на OKX","output":"Привет! Структура комиссии на бирже OKX может изменяться в зависимости от сделок и рынка, на котором вы торгуете (например, спотовом рынке, фьючерсах, опционах). Также размер комиссии может зависеть от вашего уровня VIP. По состоянию на последнее обновление в 2023 году, комиссия на OKX для спотового и фьючерсного рынков для обычных пользователей начинается с 0.1% за тейкерскую операцию и 0.08% за мейкерскую. VIP-пользователи могут получить более низкие комиссии в зависимости от объёма торговли и/или баланса OKB (собственной криптовалюты OKX), который у них на счету. Уровни комиссий обновляются и могут меняться, поэтому рекомендуется проверять актуальную информацию прямо на сайте или в приложении OKX. Также там вы сможете уточнить, какие комиссии применяются к другим видам сделок, например, к торговле опционами или на других специализированных платформах, которые предлагает OKX."},{"instruction":"Сколько транзакций мне надо выложить на OKX в спотовой торговле, чтобы сжечь с 100 USDT до 50 USDT","output":"Чтобы посчитать, сколько транзакций необходимо совершить для того, чтобы \\"сжечь\\" со 100 USDT до 50 USDT на комиссиях в спотовой торговле на OKX, необходимо знать точный размер комиссии для вашего аккаунта. Допустим, базовая комиссия для мейкеров и тейкеров на OKX составляет 0.1% от суммы сделки для пользователей без VIP статуса. Чтобы упростить задачу, предположим, что вся сумма в 100 USDT будет использована в каждой сделке (хотя на практике это довольно необычная ситуация, поскольку трейдеры обычно распределяют свои средства между множеством сделок). В случае с комиссией 0.1% для облегчения расчетов будем считать, что на каждые 100 USDT, торгуемые в сделке, с вашего баланса будет сниматься 0.1 USDT комиссии. Чтобы \\"сжечь\\" 50 USDT на комиссиях: 1. Необходимо определить общую сумму комиссий: 50 USDT. 2. Разделить эту сумму на размер комиссии за одну сделку. Если предположить, что комиссия составляет 0.1 USDT за сделку на сумму в 100 USDT, то получится 50 / 0.1 = 500 сделок. Таким образом, при условии, что вы используете всю сумму в 100 USDT в каждой сделке и комиссия составляет 0.1% за сделку, вам потребуется совершить 500 транзакций, чтобы \\"сжечь\\" 50 USDT на комиссиях на спотовой торговле на OKX. Однако на практике ситуация может быть значительно отличаться, поскольку размер комиссии может варьироваться в зависимости от вашего торгового объема, статуса на бирже и других факторов, также маловероятно, что вы будете использовать всю сумму в 100 USDT в каждой сделке, что также изменит результат."},{"instruction":"Какая прибыльность бота, который торгует на споте?","output":"Прибыльность торгового бота, который работает на спотовом рынке, сильно зависит от множества факторов, включая стратегию торговли, рыночные условия, величину комиссий биржи и уровень конкуренции среди других трейдеров и ботов. Важно понимать, что торговые боты могут проявлять высокую эффективность в определённых рыночных условиях и потерпеть неудачу в других. Вот некоторые ключевые аспекты, на которые следует обратить внимание при оценке потенциальной прибыльности бота для спотовой торговли: 1. **Стратегия торговли:** Эффективность стратегии имеет решающее значение. Некоторые стратегии лучше работают в трендовых рынках, в то время как другие оптимизированы под волатильность или рынки без чёткого направления. 2. **Параметры и настройки бота:** Даже прибыльная стратегия может потерпеть неудачу, если параметры бота не оптимизированы под текущие рыночные условия. Постоянная настройка и тестирование важны для поддержания прибыльности. 3. **Рыночные условия:** Волатильность, направление тренда и ликвидность могут значительно влиять на результаты торговли бота. 4. **Комиссии:** Низкие комиссии жизненно важны для стратегий с высокой частотой сделок, поскольку даже небольшие сборы могут съесть значительную часть прибыли. 5. **Слежение и управление риском:** Эффективное управление риском, включая установление ограничений на потери и применение стоп-лоссов, является ключом к долгосрочной прибыльности. 6. **Техническая надёжность:** Простои системы, ошибки в программном обеспечении или задержки в исполнении могут серьёзно подорвать эффективность торговли. Прибыльность торговых ботов может варьироваться от отрицательной до очень высокой, и нет гарантии успеха. Некоторые торговцы сообщают о значительной прибыли благодаря автоматизированной торговле, в то время как другие сталкиваются с убытками. Важно провести тщательное тестирование любой торговой стратегии на исторических данных и начать с небольшого объёма сделок в реальной торговле, прежде чем увеличивать масштаб."},{"instruction":"Мне нужны цифры. Мне тест не нужен. Сколько процентов приносит бот, который торгует на споте в крипте","output":"Понимаю ваш запрос, однако предоставить точные цифры прибыльности торгового бота на спотовом рынке криптовалют невозможно без знания конкретной стратегии, рыночных условий и других факторов, влияющих на торговлю. Прибыльность может значительно колебаться в зависимости от этих условий. Тем не менее, давайте рассмотрим потенциальные сценарии на примере гипотетических ситуаций: 1. **Консервативная стратегия:** Торговый бот, реализующий консервативную стратегию с упором на минимизацию рисков и маленькие, но стабильные доходы, может приносить прибыль в пределах 1% - 5% в месяц. Это приблизительная цифра и может значительно варьироваться. 2. **Агрессивная стратегия:** Боты с агрессивной стратегией, нацеленные на высокую прибыльность за счёт увеличенного риска, могут показывать прибыльность 10% - 20% в месяц или даже выше в очень благоприятных рыночных условиях. Однако следует помнить, что в этих случаях риск убытков также значительно повышается. 3. **Спекулятивная стратегия/высокочастотная торговля (HFT):** Боты, использующие спекулятивные стратегии или HFT, могут иметь очень разнообразную прибыльность — от небольшой до очень высокой (например, 30% и более в месяц), зависящую от способности бота использовать малейшие колебания цен. Имеется также реальная возможность потерь, особенно в условиях высокой волатильности или при наличии неоптимальной стратегии. Обращу ваше внимание на то, что вышеупомянутые цифры являются крайне условными и не должны восприниматься как гарантия прибыльности. Кроме того, историческая эффективность не гарантирует будущие результаты. Успешная торговля на рынке криптовалют требует глубокого анализа, постоянного обучения и адаптации к меняющейся ситуации."},{"instruction":"Как сделать это в Python Вопрос: тебе нужна переменная в классе, которая будет приватной, но чтобы статическая функция видела эту переменную","output":"Чтобы создать приватную переменную в классе, которая будет доступна статическим методам этого класса в Python, вы можете использовать конструкцию с двумя подчеркиваниями `__` в начале имени переменной. Это сделает переменную \\"приватной\\" в контексте Python (точнее, Python применяет так называемое \\"name mangling\\", изменяя имя переменной таким образом, чтобы сделать ее труднодоступной извне класса). Однако, поскольку статические методы не имеют доступа к переменным экземпляра класса без явной передачи экземпляра, вместо этого вы можете использовать переменную уровня класса, которая также будет \\"приватной\\" для внешнего доступа, но доступной внутри статических методов через имя класса. Пример кода: ```python class MyClass: __private_class_var = \\"Это приватная переменная класса\\" @classmethod def access_private_var(cls): # Доступ к приватной переменной класса через cls return cls.__private_class_var @staticmethod def static_access_to_private_var(): # Доступ к приватной переменной класса через название класса return MyClass.__private_class_var # Выведем значение приватной переменной через метод класса print(MyClass.access_private_var()) # Выведем значение приватной переменной через статический метод print(MyClass.static_access_to_private_var()) ``` В этом примере `__private_class_var` является приватной переменной класса `MyClass`, доступ к которой осуществляется через метод класса `access_private_var()` и статический метод `static_access_to_private_var()`. Обратите внимание, что статические методы не получают автоматически ссылку на класс (`cls`) или экземпляр (`self`), так что для доступа к переменным класса в статическом методе необходимо использовать непосредственно имя класса. Этот подход считается хорошей практикой для защиты внутреннего состояния класса и обеспечения контроля над доступом к его \\"приватным\\" переменным и методам."},{"instruction":"А есть такое понятие как статические переменные в Python?","output":"Да, в Python существует концепция, аналогичная статическим переменным, известным в других языках программирования, таких как C++ или Java. Однако в Python терминология может немного отличаться. Вместо \\"статических переменных\\" чаще используются термины \\"переменные класса\\" или \\"атрибуты класса\\". Переменные класса определяются в теле класса вне всех методов и принадлежат самому классу, а не какому-либо конкретному его экземпляру. Это означает, что эти переменные совместно используются всеми экземплярами класса. Изменение значения этой переменной через один экземпляр приведёт к изменению этого значения для всех остальных экземпляров, а также для самого класса, поскольку переменная принадлежит классу. Пример использования переменной класса: ```python class MyClass: static_var = \\"Это переменная класса (аналог статической переменной)\\" @staticmethod def static_method(): print(MyClass.static_var) def instance_method(self): print(MyClass.static_var) # Доступ к переменной класса через сам класс print(MyClass.static_var) # Изменение переменной класса MyClass.static_var = \\"Новое значение\\" # Доступ к переменной класса через экземпляр класса instance = MyClass() instance.instance_method() # Использование статического метода для доступа к переменной класса MyClass.static_method() ``` В этом примере `static_var` является переменной класса `MyClass`, и мы можем обратиться к ней как через имя класса, так и через экземпляр класса. Она совместно используется всеми экземплярами и самим классом. Такие переменные часто используются для хранения данных, специфических для класса и общих для всех его экземпляров, или при определении констант. Важно также отметить, что в Python также существуют статические методы, которые определяются с использованием декоратора `@staticmethod` и также принадлежат классу, а не отдельным экземплярам. Статические методы могут быть вызваны как через экземпляр класса, так и напрямую через класс, и они не имеют доступа к `self` или `cls`, что означает, что они не могут изменять состояние объекта или класса."},{"instruction":"Почему статик переменные и функции в классе - это зло","output":"Считать статические переменные и функции в классе \\"злом\\" — утверждение довольно жёсткое и однобокое, однако есть ряд аргументов, на основании которых разработчики могут выражать осторожность или предпочтение другим подходам в некоторых случаях. Важно понимать контекст, при котором использование статических переменных и функций может быть менее предпочтительным или вызывать определённые проблемы. Вот некоторые аспекты: # 1. ООП и инкапсуляция В объектно-ориентированном программировании (ООП) одним из ключевых принципов является инкапсуляция, которая предполагает управление доступом к состоянию объекта через его методы. Статические переменные и методы принадлежат классу, а не объекту, что может уменьшить чёткость инкапсуляции и объектной структуры программы. # 2. Тестирование и мокирование Статические методы и переменные могут усложнить тестирование, поскольку они не привязаны к экземплярам и не могут быть легко замокированы или заменены в процессе тестирования без добавления дополнительного функционала или использования сложных фреймворков. Это может затруднить написание модульных и изолированных тестов. # 3. Глобальное состояние Статические переменные можно рассматривать как глобальное состояние в вашем приложении, который является антипаттерном во многих ситуациях. Глобальное состояние усложняет управление зависимостями и может привести к ошибкам, связанным с порядком инициализации, а также затрудняет отслеживание изменений состояния в больших и сложных системах. # 4. Наследование и переопределение Статические методы затрудняют использование полиморфизма, поскольку их нельзя переопределить так же, как обычные методы экземпляров. Это уменьшает гибкость и возможности рефакторинга при изменениях в иерархии наследования классов. # Заключение Тем не менее, статические переменные и функции могут быть полезны в определённых сценариях, например, когда нужно хранить данные или функциональность, общую для всех экземпляров класса, или когда реализуются утилитарные функции, которые не зависят от состояния объектов. Ключ к их эффективному использованию — понимание соответствующих паттернов и антипаттернов проектирования, а также осторожность в их применении, чтобы избежать потенциальных подводных камней."},{"instruction":"Привет.

} if (cardKeyWordType == CardKeyWordType.HolyShield) { OnAfterHealthChanged?.Invoke(GameAttribute.Zero); } Effects.RemoveAll(e => e.keyword == cardKeyWordType); ``` 在这个优化版本中，使用了 `?.Any()` 来检查 `Effects` 是否不为空且有元素，如果为空或没有元素，就直接返回。这种方法涵盖了原始检查的目的并且避免了不必要的逻辑执行。 # 总结 原始代码片段的直接性和明确的条件检查是好的，优化更多是关于代码风格的偏好。对于这种场景，关键在于保持代码的可读性和清晰意图，而从性能角度来看，优化的空间非常有限。此外，当考虑到优化时，记得核心目标是提高代码的可维护性和可读性，有时这比微小的性能提升更重要。"},{"instruction":"在哪里调整rider的快捷键？ 整理代码格式的快捷键是什么？用的是mac电脑","output":"在 Rider（JetBrains 的跨平台 .NET IDE）中，您可以通过以下步骤调整快捷键： 1. 打开 Rider。 2. 选择顶部菜单中的 \\"Rider\\" > \\"Preferences\\" (或使用快捷键 `Cmd + ,`)。 3. 在 \\"Preferences\\" 对话框左侧，选择 \\"Keymap\\"。 4. 在这里，您可以搜索和调整各种操作的快捷键。您可以通过操作名称搜索，比如 \\"Reformat Code\\"，然后调整它的快捷键。 对于整理代码格式的快捷键（也就是 Reformat Code 的操作），Rider 默认提供了以下快捷键： - **在 macOS 上**：`Option + Cmd + L` - **在 Windows/Linux 上**：`Ctrl + Alt + L` 请注意，快捷键可能会因您的个人设置或不同的 Rider 版本而有所不同。如果默认快捷键与您系统中其他应用的快捷键冲突，或者您想设定一个更适合您的快捷键，您可以按上述步骤访问快捷键设置进行更改。 在 \\"Keymap\\" 部分，如果您对快捷键不确定，可以使用搜索框输入 \\"Reformat Code\\" 来快速找到并修改其快捷键。也可浏览或搜索其他具体操作的快捷键，并根据需要进行自定义设置。此外，Rider 还允许您从多种预设的键盘映射方案中选择，方便您在不同的开发环境（如从 Visual Studio 或 IntelliJ IDEA 迁移过来）之间进行适应。"}]'),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:_},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},N={class:"search-container"},q={class:"card-container"},M={key:0,class:"empty-state"},j=["disabled"],R={key:0},L={key:1};function z(n,e,l,p,i,r){const m=f("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",N,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>i.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[b,i.searchQuery]]),i.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>i.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):d("",!0)]),t("div",q,[(a(!0),o(w,null,v(r.displayedPoems,(s,g)=>(a(),k(m,{key:g,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",M,' No results found for "'+c(i.searchQuery)+'".
