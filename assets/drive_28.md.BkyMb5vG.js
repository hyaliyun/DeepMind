Он отвечает за поддержание баланса, ориентацию тела в пространстве и координацию движений при изменении положения головы и тела. Основной структурой вестибулярного анализатора является вестибулярный аппарат, который располагается во внутреннем ухе и состоит из двух основных компонентов: 1. Полукружные каналы — три канала, ориентированные в трех взаимно перпендикулярных плоскостях. Они отвечают за восприятие углового ускорения, то есть восприятие поворотов головы. 2. Отолитовые органы — саккул и утрикулус, в которых находятся микроскопические кристаллы карбоната кальция (отолиты). Они чувствительны к линейному ускорению (подъём, падение, ускорение, торможение) и к изменению головы относительно гравитационного вектора. Вестибулярный аппарат тесно связан с различными структурами центральной нервной системы, включая мозжечок, головной мозг и дополнительные нейронные пути, обеспечивающие рефлекторные связи с мышцами глаз, шеи и другими частями тела. Эта координация позволяет поддерживать фокусировку взгляда во время движения головы и тела, а также удерживать стойкость и уверенность движений. Когда человек перемещается, вестибулярный аппарат обнаруживает изменения положения с помощью механорецепторов, выставленных в полукружных каналах и отолитовых органах. Сигналы от этих рецепторов направляются по вестибулярным нервам в мозг, где они интегрируются с информацией, поступающей от других чувствительных систем, таких как зрение и проприоцепция (восприятие положения частей тела относительно друг друга). Нарушение работы вестибулярного анализатора может привести к таким симптомам, как головокружение, потеря равновесия, тошнота, неустойчивость ходьбы и другим проблемам координации движений. Обычно диагностика и лечение таких состояний проводятся с помощью специальных клинических тестов и упражнений, направленных на восстановление вестибулярной функции."},{"instruction":"Maya Santos, Miguel Santos, Theo McEwen, Maggie Lee, Chrissy Lum, Andy Arlington, Tito Chavez, Abuela Elena, Paco, Rosa Santos, and Santiago Santos (CartoonCharactersRockz Style) Cast:","output":"Maya Santos: Moana (Moana) Miguel Santos: Miguel Rivera (Coco) Theo McEwen: SpongeBob SquarePants (SpongeBob SquarePants) Maggie Lee: Velma Dinkley (Scooby-Doo) Chrissy Lum: Blossom (The Powerpuff Girls) Andy Arlington: Manny Rivera/El Tigre (El Tigre: The Adventures of Manny Rivera) Tito Chavez: Pacha (The Emperor's New Groove) Abuela Elena: Mama Coco (Coco) Paco: Olaf (Frozen) Rosa Santos: Elsa (Frozen) Santiago Santos: Hiro Hamada (Big Hero 6)"},{"instruction":"Вправа 1.

However, Windows API functions predominantly use the stdcall convention. Both conventions are used with the flat memory model introduced with the 386 processors and are designed for use with the C and C++ languages, although they can, and are, used with other languages. When a function is called in a program compiled for the Win32 environment, parameters are pushed onto the stack in a specific order, and space for the return address and possibly return value is also managed. Here's a brief overview of both the stdcall and cdecl conventions: 1. **stdcall:** - Parameters are pushed onto the stack from right to left. - The called function cleans up the stack by adding to the stack pointer after it's done using the parameters. - This is the calling convention used by the Windows API. - Since the function cleans up the stack, multiple calls to the function with the same arguments can be optimized by the compiler because the stack cleanup code is only generated once in the function's epilogue. 2. **cdecl:** - Parameters are pushed onto the stack from right to left, just like in stdcall. - The caller cleans up the stack after the function call returns. - This allows for functions with variable arguments (like \`printf\`). In terms of the stack layout, typically the following order is observed when a function is called: 1. Parameters (pushed right-to-left for both cdecl and stdcall) 2. Return address (pushed onto the stack by the call instruction) 3. Old frame pointer (pushed onto the stack if the function uses an EBP-based frame) 4. Local variables (created in the space below the frame pointer, increasing the stack size) 5. Saved registers (if the callee needs to use registers that are supposed to be preserved across calls, such as EBX, ESI, EDI) At the assembly language level, the function prolog usually involves setting up a frame pointer (though it's not strictly required for all functions) with instructions similar to the following: \`\`\`asm push ebp ; Push old frame pointer onto the stack mov ebp, esp ; Establish a new frame pointer sub esp, X ; Make space for local variables (where X is how many bytes are needed) \`\`\` And the function epilogue to clean up the frame and return would typically look like: \`\`\`asm mov esp, ebp ; Clean up the locals and reset the stack pointer pop ebp ; Restore the old frame pointer ret N ; Return and clean up the parameters from the stack if necessary (for stdcall) \`\`\` For cdecl, the caller would add to the stack pointer after the ret, if it needs to clean up the parameters: \`\`\`asm add esp, N ; Caller cleans up the parameters from the stack for cdecl convention \`\`\` Each of these calling conventions is a set of rules that defines how functions receive parameters from the caller, how they return values, and who is responsible for cleaning up the stack. It's important to note that while these are the standard conventions, compilers and developers can sometimes use custom conventions for various reasons."},{"instruction":"stdcall seems to be like a s32bit version of Far Pascal?","output":"In some respects, the \`stdcall\` calling convention is similar to the \`pascal\` calling convention used in 16-bit environments, like those encountered in older versions of Windows (Windows 3.x and earlier) and DOS. The \`pascal\` calling convention, which was popularized by the Pascal programming language, also had the callee clean up the stack, and arguments were passed on the stack from left to right, which is opposite of the cdecl and \`stdcall\`. When comparing \`stdcall\` to \`Far Pascal\`, the term \\"far\\" in the context of the older 16-bit x86 environment refers to a method of addressing that allows code to extend across different segments (hence far pointers can reference a memory location outside of the current code, data, or stack segment). The \\"near\\" counterpart, on the other hand, would be limited to the current segment. The \`stdcall\` on Win32 is indeed most similar to Pascal's calling convention in the sense that the callee is responsible for stack cleanup, and in the 32-bit flat memory model, all pointers are \\"flat\\" or \\"near\\", meaning they can address any point in the system's memory (up to 4GB of address space with 32 bits), without segment considerations that were present in 16-bit environments. So while they share the callee-cleanup trait, the \`stdcall\` is tailored to the flat 32-bit memory model of the Win32 API, whereas \`Far Pascal\` reflects conventions rooted in an earlier era of segmented memory architectures. The way parameters are ordered on the stack also distinguishes them (\`pascal\`: left-to-right, \`stdcall\`: right-to-left)."},{"instruction":"What does a stdcall prolog and epilog look like?","output":"The \`stdcall\` calling convention uses a standard prolog and epilog within a function to prepare and restore the stack and register states. Here's what a typical \`stdcall\` function's prolog and epilog look like in assembly language for x86: # Prolog The prolog of a function sets up the stack frame for the function's use, which involves reserving space for local variables and saving the base pointer. \`\`\`asm push ebp ; Save the old base pointer value mov ebp, esp ; Set the new base pointer to the current stack pointer sub esp, <size> ; Allocate space for local variables (if necessary), where <size> is the size of locals \`\`\` Here \`<size>\` is the total number of bytes needed for all local variables in the function. The compiler determines this size during the compilation. # Epilog The epilog of the function cleans up the stack frame before returning to the caller. The \`stdcall\` convention specifies that the callee is responsible for cleaning the stack of the arguments after the function returns. \`\`\`asm mov esp, ebp ; Restore the original stack pointer (esp) to the point where the function begins pop ebp ; Restore the old base pointer (ebp) ret <nbytes> ; Return from the function and clean up the <nbytes> bytes of arguments from the stack \`\`\` In \`ret <nbytes>\`, \`<nbytes>\` represents the total number of bytes of parameters that were pushed onto the stack by the caller. The \`ret\` instruction will pop the return address from the stack and use it to jump back to the caller, and then it will adjust the stack pointer by \`<nbytes>\` to remove the arguments from the stack. This is the key feature of \`stdcall\` that differentiates it from \`cdecl\`, in which the caller is responsible for cleaning up the arguments. Keep in mind that this code is assembly language and at high-level languages like C or C++, this is all managed by the compiler, so as a developer, you usually don't have to write this code by hand unless you're doing inline assembly or writing assembly code directly."},{"instruction":"How does Win32 work on ARM?","output":"Windows on ARM (WOA) is an adaptation of Microsoft Windows designed to run on ARM-based processors. Windows 10 introduced this compatibility, with further developments in Windows 10 on ARM, and later with Windows 11 on ARM. The ARM architecture differs significantly from the x86 architecture and comes with its own set of calling conventions and features. The ARM architecture utilizes different calling conventions than x86. For ARM, the standard calling convention is called the ARM Application Binary Interface (AAPBI), which specifies how subroutines receive parameters and return values. For example, the first four arguments to a function are typically passed in registers R0-R3, with additional arguments passed on the stack. The return value is passed back in R0. The ARM architecture, specifically ARMv7 which Windows 10 first targeted, can operate in two modes: AArch32 and AArch64 (introduced with ARMv8). AArch32 is a 32-bit execution state that includes a hardware-floating point and other improvements over older ARM versions, whereas AArch64 is a 64-bit execution state that allows for larger virtual and physical address spaces. Windows 10 on ARM also includes an emulation layer to run x86 applications. This emulation is primarily for user space applications; kernel drivers and other system-level code must be compiled natively for ARM. Here is a brief overview of how the AAPBI contrasts with the x86 ABI: 1. **Registers vs. Stack:** ARM uses more registers for argument passing, whereas x86 relies more on the stack, especially in the \`cdecl\` and \`stdcall\` conventions. 2. **Caller vs. Callee Save:** Both ARM and x86 have the concept of caller-saved (volatile) and callee-saved (non-volatile) registers, which dictate which registers a function can use freely and which it must restore before returning. 3. **Floating Point:** ARM has a different approach to floating-point argument passing and includes a dedicated floating-point register bank, which is used according to the AAPBI. With Windows 11, ARM's 64-bit capabilities are more prominently utilized. Microsoft has continued to improve ARM support, including x64 emulation, which allows more x86-64-bit applications to run on ARM-based devices. Overall, Windows on ARM is a different ecosystem from Win32 on x86, despite sharing many higher-level concepts and the Windows API. The underlying calling conventions and binary interface are adapted to the ARM architecture's capabilities and features."},{"instruction":"ARM used to have something called ABCS ?","output":"Yes, ARM architecture has a set of conventions known as the ARM Architecture Procedure Call Standard (AAPCS), which is part of the ARM Application Binary Interface (ABI). Note the slight difference in the acronym you mentioned (ABCS) - the correct one is AAPCS. The AAPCS defines how functions receive parameters and return values, how the stack should be managed, and which registers are to be used for certain purposes. It ensures that separately compiled binaries can work together and that function calls across shared libraries or between different languages will behave correctly. # Key Features of the AAPCS Include: 1. **Registers:** The AAPCS specifies which registers are used for passing arguments (R0-R3 for the first four arguments), which hold the return value (R0, and R1 if the return size is greater than 4 bytes), and which registers must be preserved across function calls (\`r4-r8\`, \`r10\`, \`r11\`, and the stack pointer \`r13\`). In the case of \`r9\`, its usage can vary—it's often a platform-specific register. Registers \`r0-r3\` and \`r12\` are considered scratch registers that do not need to be preserved. 2. **Stack Alignment:** The stack must always be double-word (8-byte) aligned at public interface boundaries. 3. **Variable Argument Functions:** For functions that take a variable number of arguments (like C's \`printf\`), the AAPCS has specific rules for how these arguments should be passed, using a combination of registers and the stack. 4. **Floating-Point Arguments:** Floating-point arguments are passed in floating-point registers when possible (S0-S15 for the procedure call standard variant AAPCS-VFP). However, there are variations in how floating-point arguments are handled, particularly when the VFP (Vector Floating Point) hardware is available. 5. **Half-Precision Arguments:** For procedures that take half-precision arguments, those arguments are promoted to single precision when they're passed in registers. 6. **Stack Usage:** The AAPCS also defines how the stack is used. It distinguishes between the stack/call frame set up by the called function (the \\"inter-workings\\" of the call frame) and the portion of the call frame used to pass additional arguments or to store larger return values (\\"inter-procedure-call\\" stack). The AAPCS provides the foundation for interoperable software on ARM and establishes the rules for how compilers should generate code to ensure binary compatibility between objects from different compilers and languages. The calling convention plays a critical role in ensuring that software components can work together seamlessly."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (It was just another day for Megumin. She decided to visit her friends and see what was going on. Her crusader friend - Darkness - was 8 months pregnant with quintuplets; all 5 of which had were hybrids of human and different types of dragonborn - the biggest one had red dragonborn heritage, the least active one had blue dragonborn heritage, the most active one had green dragonborn heritage, the smallest one had white dragonborn heritage, and the one that was in the middle of both size and activeness had black dragonborn heritage.)","output":"Megumin: Hey Darkness, how are you feeling today? Darkness: Oh, Megumin! I'm glad you're here. I'm feeling quite heavy with these little ones inside me. But I can't wait to meet them! Megumin: I can only imagine how excited you must be. So, have you picked out names for all of them already? Darkness: Yes, I have. For the biggest one, I've decided on Drakon. With his fiery red dragonborn heritage, it suits him perfectly. Megumin: Drakon, that sounds fierce! And what about the smallest one? Darkness: I've named her Frost, representing her gentle white dragonborn heritage. I hope she'd be as delicate and graceful as a winter snowflake. Megumin: Frost, such a beautiful name. And what about the others? Darkness: The most active one with the green dragonborn heritage, I've named him Verdant. I have a feeling he'll be a mischievous little rascal, always up to something. Megumin: Verdant, I can already picture him causing chaos. What about the one with the blue dragonborn heritage? Darkness: I've named her Azure. With her calm demeanor, I think she'll be the wisest and the one who keeps us all in check. Megumin: Azure, a perfect name for her. And what about the one in the middle, both in size and activeness? Darkness: His name is Obsidian. With his sleek black dragonborn heritage, I imagine him to be agile and strong. A true force to be reckoned with. Megumin: Obsidian, a name that holds power! Darkness, I must say, you've chosen such unique and befitting names for each of them. Darkness: Thank you, Megumin. I wanted their names to reflect their individuality. I can't wait to see how they'll grow and develop their dragonborn traits. Just as they finished their conversation, Darkness felt a sudden kick, causing her to gasp in surprise. Darkness: Oh, it seems one of them wants to make their presence known! They're already so active. Megumin: Looks like Verdant is eager to make his presence known. It won't be long until you meet all of them, Darkness. The two friends shared a warm smile, knowing that soon a new chapter would begin for Darkness and her unique quintuplets."},{"instruction":"Write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a full background, for a very long comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity; all dialogues in the scene should have quotidian, simple language that people would actually use in such a scenario, with no excessive flourishes; all events and dialogues that occur once the returning woman enters the house should be elaborated upon in detail) in a New Golden Age of Television Comedy Drama TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * A young Mexican American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she has an aversion from pooping in bathrooms outside the privacy of her home and is secretive about her bowel movements; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans in the scene) is returning home and approaching the door of her family’s house with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding to a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the smell is coming from the returning woman's pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how smelly she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, then blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to do that even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was compelled to release once getting past her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even at the expense of making a dirty mess in her pants for the sake of that relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In pursuance of the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because she seems to feel good about something dirty like pooping her pants. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to see what the returning woman supposedly felt good about making in her pants. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, wryly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach, so the pressure forced her to push everything out once the initial release happened. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants with satisfaction, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. Then, while inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. As she is performing the physical gesture, the present woman ridicules how awfully smelly the seat of the childish returning woman's pants is. After that, the present woman proceeds to tauntingly remark that she wouldn't be surprised by this point if the returning woman is also enjoying the odor that is emanating from her own pants, considering how much the returning woman seemingly enjoyed pooping her pants in the first place. The present woman emphasizes that it wouldn't surprise her if the returning woman enjoys being childishly smelly from having poop in her pants (the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, tauntingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because she unbearably stinks. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while reiterating that the returning woman unbearably stinks and imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the returning woman stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately as she is pressing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. As the bulge in her pants is being pressed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has entered the bathroom, the present woman is still comically reacting to the odor that lingers and audibly complaining about how smelly the returning woman is.","output":"FADE IN: EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY A calm, tree-lined street. Birds chirp, and a gentle wind blows kids' forgotten bikes and sidewalk chalk art hint at a community brimming with familial warmth. CUT TO: EXT. RANCH STYLE HOUSE - DAY We see MARIA, a young Mexican American woman with a complexion that speaks of heritage, brown hair tied back in a functional ponytail, sporting comfortable joggers and a cartoon-printed tee. Her pace is swift, anxiety in each step. Her eyes reveal a silent ordeal, her own body betraying her comfortable outing. MARIA (O.S., whispers to herself) Just hold on, almost there. Maria quickens her step as she notices her family's house. It's an aging but well-maintained one-story with a red door. She's blissfully unaware of the farcical hurdle that's about to unravel. She reaches the door and scrambles through her bag, face dropping when she doesn't find her key. Panic-stricken, she knocks with increasing desperation. MARIA (whispers herself) No, no, no, please not now. Frantic knocks turn to thuds, just short of a rhythmic beat against the wooden door. INT. RANCH STYLE HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS LUPE, a robust woman in her mid-fifties with laughter lines mapping her experience, and dark hair peppered with gray, moves toward the chaos at the front door—wearing a flowered apron caked with flour. LUPE (confused) ¿Qué pasa? Who's there? EXT. RANCH STYLE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Maria's face distorts, a battle between humiliation and desperation fought across her features. MARIA Mom, it's me! Open up, quick! INT. RANCH STYLE HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS Lupe shuffles through the lock, taking her time, blissfully unaware of the code red situation. LUPE Ay, mija, one second! EXT. RANCH STYLE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Maria dances from foot to foot, her plea urgent and tight-lipped. MARIA (breathless) Please, mom, now! The door finally swings open, and Maria rushes forward but is immediately intercepted by her mom's open arms—Lupe's concern materialized into a barrier. LUPE (concerned) Mija, what's wrong? Why the rush? Maria tries to wiggle past, her voice rising with quiet urgency. MARIA (move it!) I gotta get in, just—move! LUPE (grabbing Maria) Tell me, ¿qué pasa? Maria is caught, one hand on Lupe's wrist, the other creeping toward her stomach. Her expression collapses into surrender right there in the doorway, her eyes widening in shock. LUPE (baffled) Maria, ¿estás bien? The truth dawns on Lupe as Maria's body relaxes against her will. A soft grunt escapes her as she nods slowly toward her mother, simultaneously mortified and relieved. LUPE (wrinkling her nose) What's that smell? Maria meets her eyes, a crimson tide flooding her cheeks. Silence hangs thick until Lupe pieces it together, her features contorting with disbelief and disgust. LUPE (disgusted) You didn’t? Maria's mouth nets no sound, her voice a hostage to the situation. LUPE (sniffing, disgusted) Is that from you? Maria's gaze falls to the floor, a mute plea for passage. MARIA (whispering) Can I just go in? Lupe steps aside, covering her nose with her apron, and Maria shuffles in, cupping the back of her pants. Once they're inside, Lupe halts Maria with a stern hand. LUPE (angry) Wait! Don’t you dare drop any... Lupe's lecture unravels, taunting scolds accentuating the absurdity. Maria stands still, the childish pride of her triumphant release battling with the inescapable shame of the act. MARIA (playfully sullen) If you’d opened faster... This is your fault. LUPE (incredulous) That's no excuse for a grown woman, mija! MARIA insists, jesting within her mortification, hand awkwardly patting her soiled pants. MARIA (wryly) It was overbearing. It had to happen. Lupe peers over, her taunts falling heavy. LUPE (mockingly) Let's see this mess you're so proud of. Maria fends her off weakly, protesting despite consenting. Maria’s defense transforms into an illusion of vindication, even as her heart races with embarrassment. MARIA (coyly) It was too much. Had to push it all out. LUPE (worldly) You're too old for this, niña. And now you stink like a baby. Her examination turns into an exaggerated sniff near Maria's pants, a mockery of maternal duties. Despite the disgust, Maria plays along, a feeble attempt to diffuse tension. MARIA (playfully) Well, since you won’t let me clean... LUPE dismisses her and ushers Maria towards the bathroom. LUPE (adamant) Go clean up, you smell unbearable! The journey to the bathroom is a crowded dance of clamor and cringe. Maria concerned with containment and Lupe with vocal disgust. Reaching the threshold, Maria tests her luck, pausing with a mischievous glint in her eye. MARIA (teasing) Want to change my diaper too? Lupe’s feigned anger turns practical, pushing Maria into the sanctity of the restroom, the mess in her pants spreading like a heavy-handed metaphor for lost dignity. LUPE (pushes) In you go, miss filthy! Maria’s cries of disgust accompany flushed cheeks as she steps out of view. Lupe's voice trails off with playful complaints about unheard-of stench. CUT TO: LUPE (under her breath) Ay Dios mío, the things I see... Wipe to black. FADE OUT."},{"instruction":"Империя Хадария основана великим императором по имени Хадарид.

She couldn't help but chuckle, realizing that it could be any of the five little ones playing hide-and-seek. \\"They're definitely excited to meet you, Megumin,\\" Darkness remarked, her voice filled with joy. A sudden ripple of laughter echoed through the room as the unborn quintuplets chimed in, their telepathic voices filling Megumin's mind. \\"Hello, Auntie Megumin! We've been waiting for you,\\" the smallest one with white dragonborn heritage giggled. \\"We've been discussing who gets to come out first,\\" the biggest one with red dragonborn heritage chimed in with a touch of pride. \\"And I'll be the most active one! Always ready for an adventure,\\" declared the one with green dragonborn heritage energetically. The voice of the one with black dragonborn heritage joined in, teasingly saying, \\"I'll be the mischief-maker, causing trouble and keeping everyone on their toes.\\" Amidst the laughter and playful banter, the voice of the one with blue dragonborn heritage spoke up, sounding calm and soothing. \\"I may be the least active, but I'll offer comfort and tranquility when needed.\\" Megumin couldn't help but feel overwhelmed by the uniqueness of these unborn hybrids.

With her friends by her side, they would face anything that came their way, even if it involved raising a handful of telepathic dragonborn hybrids."},{"instruction":"What is the standard calling convention for Z80 and 6502 based systems?","output":"The Z80 and 6502 are both 8-bit microprocessors that were widely used in various computing systems, including early personal computers, game consoles, and embedded systems. Because they were used in a wide range of systems, there was no single standard calling convention across all platforms based on these CPUs. Instead, calling conventions could vary depending on the operating system, the language/runtime environment in use, and the conventions adopted by individual software developers or teams. However, there are some general practices that were commonly used: **Z80 Calling Conventions:** The Z80 processor has a more sophisticated set of instructions and addressing modes than the 6502, as well as more registers, allowing for more flexibility in designing calling conventions. A typical calling convention for Z80-based systems might involve: 1. Passing parameters in registers where possible, for faster access. 2. Using the stack to store additional parameters, return addresses, and local variables. 3. Employing the \`CALL\` and \`RET\` instructions for subroutine calls and returns. 4. Preserving the contents of some registers (usually the alternate set, \`AF'\`, \`BC'\`, \`DE'\`, and \`HL'\`) across calls, treating them as callee-saved. Some calling conventions might require the caller to save these if they want to preserve their values. The specifics would be influenced by the size of the data, the available registers, and the conventions of the particular system or software. **6502 Calling Conventions:** The 6502 has a more limited set of registers (Accumulator, X index, Y index, and Stack Pointer), which influenced its calling conventions: 1. Passing parameters in registers for quick access when possible, often using the Accumulator for single-byte values or return values. 2. Using the stack to pass additional arguments or to store local variables and return addresses. This typically involved manually pushing and pulling bytes onto the stack, as the 6502 does not have direct push/pop instructions for general-purpose registers. 3. Using the \`JSR\` (Jump to SubRoutine) instruction to call functions, and \`RTS\` (ReTurn from Subroutine) for returning. 4. Frequently, the caller would be responsible for saving and restoring register state if necessary, given the limited number of registers and the common use of the Accumulator for return values. Developers on both systems often had to optimize their calling conventions for space and speed, as memory and processing power were quite limited on these early microprocessor systems. The use of zero page (on 6502-based systems) or certain fixed memory locations (often seen on Z80-based systems) to store frequently used variables or to pass parameters is another example of such optimization. In summary, while there was no absolute standard calling convention for Z80 and 6502 based systems, certain patterns and practices were common, although they varied based on the specific requirements and constraints of the systems and software in question."},{"instruction":"I thought CP/M(Z80) and Acrorn (6502) had standardised conventions for paramater passing?","output":"Indeed, when discussing specific operating systems or platforms such as CP/M for the Z80 or Acorn computers for the 6502, you would find more standardized calling conventions. The conventions used by a particular platform or OS were typically well-documented to enable software interoperability and ease of development. **Z80 CP/M:** The CP/M operating system, which was popular on Z80-based computers, had a standard calling convention for interacting with the operating system's BIOS and BDOS (Basic Disk Operating System) which provided a set of software interrupts: - The CP/M BDOS function calls were invoked using a software interrupt \`INT 21H\` or \`CALL 5\` where: - The function number was placed in register \`C\` - Additional parameters were passed in other registers (\`DE\`, \`HL\`, etc.) and on the stack, as required by the specific BDOS call. - Commonly, CP/M programs returned control to the operating system by calling function 0 (\`System Reset\`) using the BDOS call mechanism. These conventions ensured that software written for CP/M would behave consistently across different hardware platforms running CP/M. **6502 Acorn Computers:** Acorn computers such as the BBC Micro, which used the 6502 processor, had their own set of conventions: - The BBC Micro, in particular, used a standardized set of operating system calls called OSBYTE, OSWORD, and OSCLI for various functions: - For OSBYTE and OSWORD, parameters were passed in the Accumulator and the X and Y index registers. - For certain calls, parameters and results were also passed through particular memory locations. - Indirect jumps through vectors at specific memory locations were also a method used to call certain system functions, which allowed for users or other software to intercept and override those calls. The Acorn systems also provided a range of APIs that were accessible from user programs, and these would have been consistent across machines running the same or compatible versions of the OS, ensuring a form of standardization. It is this OS-level standardization that often matters most in terms of how software should make calls and pass parameters since it dictates compatibility and interoperability within the ecosystem of that operating system or family of computers."},{"instruction":"Hoi","output":"Hallo!

However, there is one issue in the termination handling code: \`\`\`javascript // Handle termination signals to clean up resources before exiting process.on('exit', handleTermination); process.on('SIGINT', handleTermination); process.on('SIGTERM', handleTermination); \`\`\` There is a problem with attaching the \`handleTermination\` function to the 'exit' event. The 'exit' event is emitted when the Node.js process is about to exit as a result of either: - The process.exit() method being called explicitly; - The Node.js event loop no longer having any additional work to perform. In the case of the 'exit' event, calling asynchronous code within the 'exit' handler function is not safe. This means that your \`handleTermination\` async function might not complete its operations, because the event loop is deactivated when the 'exit' event is emitted. Here's a correction to this part: \`\`\`javascript // Correctly handle termination signals to clean up resources before exiting process.on('SIGINT', handleTermination); process.on('SIGTERM', handleTermination); // The 'exit' handler should not perform asynchronous operations process.on('exit', (code) => { // Code related to logging or other synchronous cleanup can go here }); \`\`\` The 'SIGINT' and 'SIGTERM' events can still utilize the asynchronous \`handleTermination\` function because they allow you to perform cleanup before the process exits. Remember to ensure that the lock cleanup (\`await lockManager.removeLock();\`) and process exit (\`process.exit();\` or \`process.exit(1);\`) logic is only in \`handleTermination\`, which should be triggered by signals that can be intercepted (like 'SIGINT' and 'SIGTERM'), not on the 'exit' event.

Here's an example section you could include: --- # ⚙️ Integration Guide To ensure the best robustness and to take full advantage of Node Locksmith, follow these steps to integrate the locking mechanism into your main Node.js application file. **Step 1: Import and Set Up LockManager** At the top of your main file, import \`LockManager\` from \`node-locksmith\` and create an instance: \`\`\`javascript const LockManager = require('node-locksmith'); const lockManager = new LockManager({ lockFileName: 'myApp.lock' // Customize your lock file name if needed }); \`\`\` **Step 2: Check and Create a Lock** Just before your main application logic, ensure that there's no existing lock, then create a new one: \`\`\`javascript async function main() { await lockManager.checkLock(); // This will throw an error if another instance is running await lockManager.createLock(); // Your app logic goes here // At the end, remove the lock await lockManager.removeLock(); } main().catch(console.error); // In case checkLock detects a running instance \`\`\` **Step 3: Graceful Shutdown Handling** To handle application shutdown properly (e.g., when interrupt signals like SIGINT or SIGTERM are received), include the \`handleTermination\` function in your main file and attach it to the appropriate process events. Add this code towards the end of your main file: \`\`\`javascript async function handleTermination(signal) { try { console.info(\`Received {signal}, terminating gracefully...\`); // Your pre-exit logic (if any) // Remove the lock to allow future instances await lockManager.removeLock(); console.info('Application terminated gracefully.'); process.exit(0); } catch (error) { console.error('Error during termination:', error); process.exit(1); } } // Handle termination signals to clean up resources before exiting process.on('SIGINT', () => handleTermination('SIGINT')); process.on('SIGTERM', () => handleTermination('SIGTERM')); \`\`\` By adding these code snippets to your main file, you can control the execution of your application with Node Locksmith and prevent multiple instances from running simultaneously. --- This section provides clear instructions on how users can add your code to their main application file, ensuring they correctly integrate Node Locksmith for efficient single-instance locking.

Below is a step-by-step guide to create a new Node.js package and publish it to the npm registry for public use: # Prerequisites: - Node.js installed on your system. - An npm account (create one at [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com)). - Logged in to npm in your command line (\`npm login\`). # Step 1: Initialize Your Package 1. Create a new directory for your project. \`\`\`sh mkdir node-locksmith cd node-locksmith \`\`\` 2. Initialize a new Node.js project with \`npm init\`. Follow the prompts to create a \`package.json\` file. \`\`\`sh npm init \`\`\` # Step 2: Write Your Module Code 1. Create your main module file, e.g., \`index.js\`, and write your module's code in it. 2. Save and close the file. # Step 3: Create Additional Files 1. Write a README.md file with documentation on how to install and use your module. 2. Optionally, add other supportive files like \`CONTRIBUTING.md\`, \`LICENSE\`, \`CHANGELOG.md\`, etc. # Step 4: Testing Your Module 1. Make sure to write tests for your module. You can use libraries like Mocha, Jest, or any other testing framework. 2. Ensure that all tests pass before proceeding. # Step 5: Confirm Your npm Version Update npm to the latest version to ensure the best experience. \`\`\`sh npm install npm@latest -g \`\`\` # Step 6: Log In to npm Log into your npm account from the command line if you haven't done so already. \`\`\`sh npm login \`\`\` You will be prompted for your username, password, and email. # Step 7: Version Your Package Set a version for your package that follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). \`\`\`sh npm version 1.0.0 \`\`\` # Step 8: Publish Your Package Publish your package to npm. Ensure your package's name is unique. \`\`\`sh npm publish \`\`\` If the command executes successfully, your package is now live on npm! # Step 9: Post-Publish - Go to your package's page on npm to ensure everything looks good (replace \`node-locksmith\` with your package name): \`\`\` https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-locksmith \`\`\` - Share your package with the community. - Optionally, tag your GitHub repository with the npm package version. # Step 10: Updating Your Package If you make changes to your package, you'll need to update the version and publish again. 1. Make your changes. 2. Add and commit changes with Git (if using version control). 3. Update the package version: \`\`\`sh npm version patch # or minor, or major, depending on the kind of changes \`\`\` 4. Publish the new version: \`\`\`sh npm publish \`\`\` # Useful Tips: - Review the npm documentation for any specific configurations. - Use \`.npmignore\` to avoid publishing unnecessary files. - Look at the \`files\` field in \`package.json\` if you want to specify which files get published. - Ensure your package does not contain sensitive data before publishing. **Note**: If you intend to publish a scoped package (e.g., \`@username/package-name\`), make sure you set the access level to \`public\` using: \`\`\`sh npm publish --access public \`\`\` Remember, publishing a package is a commitment to maintain it.

To publish updates to your npm package, follow these steps: # Step 1: Make Your Changes Make the necessary changes to your package code, documentation, tests, or any other aspects of your package. # Step 2: Run Tests (Optional but Recommended) If you have a test suite set up, run it to ensure your updates haven't broken any functionality: \`\`\`sh npm test \`\`\` # Step 3: Update the Version Before you can publish your changes, you need to update your package's version number. According to semantic versioning (semver), version numbers are made up of three segments: major, minor, and patch. - **Major version** when you make incompatible API changes (e.g., 2.0.0) - **Minor version** when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner (e.g., 1.1.0) - **Patch version** when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes (e.g., 1.0.1) Use the \`npm version\` command followed by the version update type. This will update the version number in \`package.json\` and create a new Git tag if you're using version control: \`\`\`sh npm version patch # for bug fixes npm version minor # for new features npm version major # for breaking changes \`\`\` # Step 4: Commit Your Changes (If Using Git) If you're using Git, commit your changes and the version update: \`\`\`sh git add . git commit -m \\"Describe your changes here\\" git push git push --tags # pushes the new Git tag created by npm version \`\`\` # Step 5: Publish the Update Now publish the updated package to npm: \`\`\`sh npm publish \`\`\` If you're publishing a scoped package and want to keep it public, use: \`\`\`sh npm publish --access public \`\`\` # Step 6: Verify the Update After publishing, you can verify that your update has been successful by checking the package on the npm website, or by installing the package to test if the changes have been reflected: \`\`\`sh npm install <your-package-name>@<new-version> \`\`\` Remember to review your package documentation and ensure any changes to the API or features are documented accordingly. If your package has a changelog, it's good practice to update it with the details of the changes and the new version number. # Notes: - Always test your package thoroughly before publishing updates. - It’s a good practice to follow a consistent release process that includes testing, code review, and clear versioning. - Keep an eye on user feedback and any issues that may arise from the update to respond to any concerns promptly."},{"instruction":"npm ERR! 403 403 Forbidden - PUT https://registry.npmjs.org/node-locksmith - You cannot publish over the previously published versions: 1.0.0.","output":"The error message you received indicates that you are trying to publish a new version of your package with a version number that already exists in the registry (1.0.0). npm does not allow overwriting of published versions for the integrity and reliability of packages. To resolve this issue, you need to increment the version number of your package before attempting to publish again. You can do this using the \`npm version\` command as explained in the previous step. Here are the commands again for reference: To update the patch version (e.g., 1.0.1): \`\`\`sh npm version patch \`\`\` To update the minor version (e.g., 1.1.0): \`\`\`sh npm version minor \`\`\` To update the major version (e.g., 2.0.0): \`\`\`sh npm version major \`\`\` Each of these commands will automatically increment the version number in your \`package.json\` file, commit the change, and create a new tag in your version control system if it's configured. If you are not ready to commit other changes or if you simply need to increment the version without a commit, you can add the \`--no-git-tag-version\` flag to the command: \`\`\`sh npm version patch --no-git-tag-version \`\`\` Once you have updated the version number, you can publish your package to npm again with: \`\`\`sh npm publish \`\`\` Each version you publish should be a unique increment based on the changes you've made, following semantic versioning principles. **Important Note**: Be cautious when updating version numbers and making your changes ready for publishing.

When choosing keywords, think about what terms users might input when searching for functionality that your package provides. Here are some tips for selecting effective keywords: 1. **Relevant**: Choose keywords that are directly related to the functionality of your package. If your package is a lock manager, you definitely want to include terms like \\"lock\\", \\"process control\\", \\"singleton\\", and \\"lock manager\\". 2. **Specific**: Include specific terms that describe the unique aspects of your package. If your package is designed for Node.js applications, you can add \\"nodejs\\", \\"node\\", etc. 3. **Broad**: Add broader terms that encompass the general theme or category. If your package can be used for task scheduling or to prevent concurrent executions, consider terms like \\"scheduling\\", \\"cron\\", \\"batch jobs\\", \\"concurrency\\", \\"single instance\\". 4. **Technologies and Dependencies**: If your package is meant to work with certain technologies or integrates with other libraries, include them as well. For example, if your package is useful in Express.js or React.js applications, you might want to add \\"express\\" or \\"react\\". 5. **Use Cases**: Think of the different use cases for your package and include them. For example, \\"maintenance tasks\\", \\"deployment\\", \\"development utilities\\". 6. **Community and Ecosystem**: Consider keywords that associate your package with a particular community or ecosystem if applicable, like \\"frontend\\", \\"backend\\", \\"fullstack\\", \\"devops\\". Here's how you might structure the keywords array in your \`package.json\` file: \`\`\`json \\"keywords\\": [ \\"lock\\", \\"lock manager\\", \\"singleton\\", \\"nodejs\\", \\"node\\", \\"process control\\", \\"concurrency\\", \\"single instance\\", \\"cron\\", \\"batch jobs\\", \\"scheduling\\", \\"task management\\", \\"maintenance tasks\\", \\"deployment\\", \\"development utilities\\" ] \`\`\` When choosing keywords, it's also useful to have a look at similar packages on npm and see what keywords they are using to ensure you cover the relevant terms. The goal is to use keywords that are both diverse enough to cover many aspects of your package and specific enough to be useful for users searching for your type of package."},{"instruction":"Thanks now my package got deployed I need to send an email to my colleagues about this and tell them to start using it Please use informal and no english jargon","output":"Subject: Check Out My Newly Released Node Package! 🚀 Hey Team!

(yes/no) ', (answer) => { if (answer.toLowerCase() === 'yes') { // Proceed with the application } else if (answer.toLowerCase() === 'no') { // Do not delete the lock file, just exit console.log('Operation cancelled by the user.'); process.exit(); } else { console.log('Invalid input detected.'); // Make sure to do proper cleanup or logic repetition as needed } }); \`\`\` In this pseudo-code: 1. If the user inputs 'yes', the application proceeds as normal. 2. If the user inputs 'no', the application does not perform the cleanup operation that deletes the lock file; it simply prints a message and exits. 3. If the user inputs anything other than 'yes' or 'no', an error message is printed, and you can implement the logic accordingly. Remember to consider edge cases and ensure that your cleanup operations are only called in scenarios where it's appropriate to release resources, including lock files. Testing your code thoroughly with different user inputs is key to prevent unwanted behavior like accidental deletion of the lock file."},{"instruction":"const fs = require('fs').promises; const path = require('path'); const process = require('process'); const ps = require('ps-node'); /** * Manages a lock file to ensure single-instance execution of the application. */ class LockManager { /** * Constructor for LockManager class. * * @param {Object} options - Configuration options. * @param {string} [options.lockFileName='app.lock'] - Name of the lock file. * @param {string} [options.lockFileDir=__dirname] - Directory for the lock file. * @param {number} [options.killTimeout=5000] - Timeout for killing another instance. * @param {number} [options.waitForExitTimeout=10000] - Timeout for waiting for another process to exit. * @param {number} [options.checkInterval=500] - Interval for checking if another process is running. * @param {number} [options.maxRetries=3] - Maximum number of retries for acquiring the lock. * @param {string} [options.defaultAnswer='yes'] - Default answer for user prompts. */ constructor(options = {}) { const defaults = { lockFileName: 'app.lock', lockFileDir: __dirname, killTimeout: 5000, waitForExitTimeout: 10000, checkInterval: 500, maxRetries: 3, defaultAnswer: 'yes' }; const settings = { ...defaults, ...options }; this.lockFilePath = path.join(settings.lockFileDir, settings.lockFileName); this.killTimeout = settings.killTimeout; this.waitForExitTimeout = settings.waitForExitTimeout; this.checkInterval = settings.checkInterval; this.maxRetries = settings.maxRetries; this.defaultAnswer = settings.defaultAnswer; this.lockAcquired = false; this.pid = process.pid; this.otherProcessExited = false; } /** * Checks if a lock file exists and if the process it represents is still running. * If another instance is running, prompts the user to kill it. * * @returns {Promise<void>} - Resolves when the lock status is checked. */ async checkLock() { try { const lockData = await fs.readFile(this.lockFilePath, 'utf8'); const storedPid = parseInt(lockData.trim(), 10); if (isNaN(storedPid)) { console.error('Error: Invalid PID found in the lock file.

The segment in question from within the \`checkLock\` function seems to be this: \`\`\`javascript if (userInput && userInput.toLowerCase() === 'yes') { // Logic to kill the old process and eventually acquire the lock } else { console.log('Exiting without starting a new instance.'); process.exit(0); } \`\`\` By default, when the user inputs 'no' and the program exits, the \`handleTermination\` function is not expected to be invoked, because the process is exiting normally and not due to a signal like \`SIGINT\` or \`SIGTERM\`. However, the behavior you're experiencing suggests that \`handleTermination\` might be getting called even when the user enters 'no'. The issue could be due to the way Node.js handles process exit. To ensure that the lock is not removed when the user enters 'no', you can use a flag indicating when to perform cleanup. Here's an updated version of the \`handleTermination\` function with an additional check: \`\`\`javascript let shouldRemoveLock = true; async function handleTermination(signal) { try { if (shouldRemoveLock) { console.info(\`Received {signal}, terminating gracefully...\`); // Your pre-exit logic (if any) // Remove the lock to allow future instances await lockManager.removeLock(); } console.info('Application terminated gracefully.'); process.exit(0); } catch (error) { console.error('Error during termination:', error); process.exit(1); } } \`\`\` And within the \`checkLock\` function, you would set \`shouldRemoveLock\` to \`false\` when the user chooses not to kill the old instance: \`\`\`javascript if (userInput && userInput.toLowerCase() === 'yes') { // Logic to kill the old process and eventually acquire the lock } else { shouldRemoveLock = false; // Prevent lock file from being removed console.log('Exiting without starting a new instance.'); process.exit(0); } \`\`\` Now, when the user enters 'no', the application should exit without invoking \`handleTermination\` and without removing the lock file. Please make sure to define the \`shouldRemoveLock\` variable in a scope that is accessible by both \`handleTermination\` and \`checkLock\`. Adjusting the actual application's flow to adhere to this pattern will ensure that the lock file is preserved unless the process ends because it received a signal that would have otherwise enabled \`handleTermination\`."},{"instruction":"so are you thinking handleTermination is in same lockmanager?","output":"Apologies for any confusion. The \`handleTermination\` function is not inherently a part of the \`LockManager\` class. It's a standalone piece of code you would have in your main application file, separate from the \`LockManager\`. The \`handleTermination\` function is meant to handle specific termination signals (\`SIGINT\`, \`SIGTERM\`) and perform cleanup tasks like releasing the lock file. However, the code snippets inside the \`checkLock\` function of the \`LockManager\` and the \`handleTermination\` function need to be somewhat coordinated. When the user enters 'no', the lock file shouldn't be removed, which suggests that the current handling of the cleanup process may need to be modified. Consider implementing a mechanism in your main application file to handle user input and determine if \`handleTermination\` should remove the lock. For instance, you could do: \`\`\`javascript // In your main application file, outside the LockManager let shouldRemoveLock = true; function handleTermination(signal) { if (shouldRemoveLock) { console.info(\`Received {signal}, terminating gracefully...\`); lockManager.removeLock().catch((error) => { console.error('Error during lock removal:', error); }); } else { console.info('Not removing the lock due to user input.'); } console.info('Application terminated gracefully.'); process.exit(0); } //... Further down in the area where you're using lockManager.checkLock const userInput = /* the logic to get user input */; if (userInput.toLowerCase() === 'no') { shouldRemoveLock = false; console.log('Exiting without starting a new instance.'); process.exit(0); // User chose not to proceed; nothing else happens after this. } \`\`\` Ensure \`shouldRemoveLock\` is set in the right context. If the user chooses 'no', you then set \`shouldRemoveLock\` to \`false\` before exiting. It's important that \`shouldRemoveLock\` is accessible in both the main application scope and where the \`handleTermination\` function is defined, so they can work together to determine whether to remove the lock file on termination."},{"instruction":"handleTermination and exit events are in a different file But can we bring that into the lockmanager?","output":"Yes, you can integrate the \`handleTermination\` logic into the \`LockManager\` class if you prefer to encapsulate everything within the same class. This approach can make your lock management more modular and self-contained, which can be a cleaner design for managing your application's lifecycle events. Here's an example of how you could modify your \`LockManager\` class to include \`handleTermination\` logic and listen to the relevant exit events: \`\`\`javascript const fs = require('fs').promises; const path = require('path'); const process = require('process'); const ps = require('ps-node'); class LockManager { // ... other parts of your LockManager class ... // Call this method in your main application file to initialize event handlers. initializeTerminationHandlers() { // Save reference to the current instance for use in the event listeners. const lockManagerInstance = this; // Define the termination handler function. function handleTermination(signal) { console.info(\`Received {signal}, handling termination...\`); // Check if the lock should be removed based on the current instance state. if (lockManagerInstance.lockAcquired) { lockManagerInstance.removeLock() .then(() => console.info('Lock file removed.')) .catch((error) => console.error('Error removing lock file:', error)) .finally(() => process.exit(0)); } else { console.info('Lock was not acquired. Exiting without removing lock file.'); process.exit(0); } } // Register termination handlers to clean up resources before exiting. process.on('SIGINT', handleTermination); process.on('SIGTERM', handleTermination); process.on('exit', handleTermination); } // ... rest of your LockManager class ... } module.exports = LockManager; \`\`\` Then, in your main application file, you would create an instance of \`LockManager\`, set up the termination handlers and continue with the lock checking logic: \`\`\`javascript const LockManager = require('./LockManager'); // Update the path as needed. const lockManager = new LockManager(); lockManager.initializeTerminationHandlers(); // Start your application logic here. // Use lockManager.checkLock() and lockManager.createLock() as needed. \`\`\` This way, the \`LockManager\` is responsible for setting up its own termination handlers. The \`initializeTerminationHandlers\` method ensures that the termination handling logic is implemented in context with the state of the \`LockManager\` instance. The lock file will be removed only when necessary, based on the state (\`lockAcquired\`) of the \`LockManager\`. Make sure to adjust the logic based on your workflow and consider any edge cases that may arise due to merging these responsibilities into the \`LockManager\`. This solution assumes that there's a single \`LockManager\` instance handling the application's locking logic, so it should be consistent with the application's life cycle."},{"instruction":"one scenario, I'm having three different engines running independently. and all are imported same lockmanager file. So if one engine killed others wont affect right ?","output":"If all three engines are running independently and if each one is using the same \`LockManager\` module to manage its lock file, they should not affect each other's operation as long as they have been configured to use different lock files or are located in different working directories where their respective lock files are managed. Each instance of your \`LockManager\` will manage its own lock file based on the configuration it receives upon instantiation. Here's how you can ensure they don't interfere with each other: 1. **Different Lock File Names**: When creating instances of the \`LockManager\` for each engine, pass distinct \`lockFileName\` and/or \`lockFileDir\` values to the constructor. \`\`\`javascript // Engine 1 const engine1LockManager = new LockManager({ lockFileName: 'engine1.lock' }); // Engine 2 const engine2LockManager = new LockManager({ lockFileName: 'engine2.lock' }); // Engine 3 const engine3LockManager = new LockManager({ lockFileName: 'engine3.lock' }); \`\`\` 2. **Different Directories**: You can also specify different lock file directories for each engine, which can be a more straightforward way to separate the lock mechanisms, especially if the code for each engine is located in different directories. \`\`\`javascript // Engine 1 const engine1LockManager = new LockManager({ lockFileDir: path.join(__dirname, 'engine1') }); // Engine 2 const engine2LockManager = new LockManager({ lockFileDir: path.join(__dirname, 'engine2') }); // Engine 3 const engine3LockManager = new LockManager({ lockFileDir: path.join(__dirname, 'engine3') }); \`\`\` By using either of these approaches, you explicitly ensure that the lock file for each engine is unique; therefore: - Terminating one engine will only remove its specific lock file and will not affect the others. - Each engine's lock manager instance operates independently based on the dedicated lock file it manages. In summary, to prevent the engines from interfering with each other, use unique lock file names and/or directories for each engine's \`LockManager\` instance. This way, their operations are isolated, and the action of one (such as being killed and consequently having its lock file removed) should have no impact on the other running engines."},{"instruction":"Toute recherche scientifique , « doit comporter l’utilisation de méthodes et techniques, bien définies, transmissibles, susceptibles d’être appliquées à nouveau dans les mêmes conditions, adaptées au genre des problèmes et phénomènes en cause».

I'm so glad you're here,\\" Darkness exclaimed, her voice filled with a mix of exhaustion and joy. \\"Come inside, the quintuplets have something incredible to show you.\\" Curiosity piqued, Megumin followed Darkness inside and settled in the living room. Darkness waddled over to the couch and gingerly lowered herself onto it, her huge baby bump dominating the space. Megumin couldn't help but gape at its sheer size. \\"They're getting quite restless in there,\\" Darkness whispered, a mix of wonder and exhaustion in her eyes. \\"But that's not all, Megumin. They're telepathic. They can communicate not just with each other, but with me and even with those outside.\\" Megumin's eyes widened in amazement. \\"That's incredible! I can't believe they have such a unique ability. Is it just telepathy, or can they do anything else?\\" With a gentle smile, Darkness placed a hand on her belly. \\"It seems like their telepathic abilities are just the beginning. They're already showing traits from their different dragonborn heritages. The red dragonborn hybrid is the strongest and seems to have a fiery personality, while the blue dragonborn hybrid is the calmest and most peaceful. The green dragonborn hybrid is always on the move, and the white dragonborn hybrid, though small, is surprisingly feisty. As for the black dragonborn hybrid, it's a perfect blend, both in size and activeness.\\" Megumin was enthralled by the descriptions, her mind racing with possibilities. \\"Will they be able to use their dragon powers once they're born?\\" Darkness nodded, a mix of anticipation and apprehension on her face. \\"I believe they will inherit some of their dragonborn traits, but only time will tell how powerful they'll be. We'll definitely need to keep an eye on them and help them understand their abilities.\\" Just as the conversation was reaching its peak, Megumin felt a gentle tug at her consciousness. Turning her attention towards Darkness's belly, she realized the telepathic quintuplets were trying to communicate with her. \\"Hello?\\" Megumin thought, projecting her voice into their minds. A chorus of voices responded, each tinged with the respective dragonborn heritage. \\"Hello, Megumin! We've been waiting to meet you too.\\" Overwhelmed with excitement, Megumin couldn't contain her joy. \\"I can't wait to see you all when you're born! We'll have so many adventures together.\\" As the telepathic conversation continued, Megumin couldn't help but revel in the extraordinary nature of these Dragonborn quintuplets.

Darkness sighed, her exhaustion weighing heavy on her shoulders. As a crusader, she was used to enduring physical pain and discomfort, but nothing quite prepared her for the relentless kicks of her green dragonborn baby. Glancing at the clock, Darkness realized it was already past midnight. She knew she couldn't go on like this; she needed to find a way to sleep despite the persistent movements. With a determined look on her face, she carefully maneuvered herself into a new position, hoping this would finally provide some relief. Just as she settled in, her baby gave another powerful kick, causing Darkness to jolt up in surprise. \\"Oh my goodness!\\" she exclaimed, hand instinctively flying to her belly. \\"You're quite the little acrobat, aren't you?\\" As if in response, the baby unleashed another barrage of kicks, each one more insistent than the last. Darkness couldn't help but chuckle. Despite the discomfort, she couldn't deny the bond she already felt with her unborn child. This green dragonborn baby was full of energy and spirit, just like its heritage suggested. With a tinge of pride, Darkness whispered, \\"You're going to be a force to be reckoned with, my little adventurer.\\" Determined not to let the kicks disrupt her rest any longer, Darkness took a deep breath, allowing herself to relax. She closed her eyes, focusing on the soothing rhythm of her own breathing while the baby continued to express its existence through its vigorous kicks. Gradually, Darkness's fatigue caught up with her, and the weariness washed over her like a warm blanket. The kicks, though still present, seemed to fade into the background as her body finally succumbed to sleep. In her dreams, she imagined a future filled with wild adventures alongside her quintuplets, with the green dragonborn baby leading the way, their shared telepathic connection strengthening their bond. As Darkness drifted off into a well-deserved slumber, the kicks somewhat eased, as if even the green dragonborn baby recognized the need for rest.

It's nice to meet you,\\" the voice said, sounding much older and wiser than a typical baby's voice. Megumin's jaw dropped, her eyes darting between Darkness and her belly. \\"They can already talk?

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding to a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the smell is coming from the returning woman's pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how smelly she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, then blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to do that even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was compelled to release once getting past her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even at the expense of making a dirty mess in her pants for the sake of that relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In pursuance of the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because she seems to feel good about something dirty like pooping her pants. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to see what the returning woman supposedly felt good about making in her pants. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, wryly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach, so the pressure forced her to push everything out once the initial release happened. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants with satisfaction, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. Then, while inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. As she is performing the physical gesture, the present woman ridicules how awfully smelly the seat of the childish returning woman's pants is. After that, the present woman proceeds to tauntingly remark that she wouldn't be surprised by this point if the returning woman is also enjoying the odor that is emanating from her own pants, considering how much the returning woman seemingly enjoyed pooping her pants in the first place. The present woman emphasizes that it wouldn't surprise her if the returning woman enjoys being childishly smelly from having poop in her pants (the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, tauntingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because she unbearably stinks. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while reiterating that the returning woman unbearably stinks and imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the returning woman stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately as she is pressing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. As the bulge in her pants is being pressed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has entered the bathroom, the present woman is still comically reacting to the odor that lingers and audibly complaining about how smelly the returning woman is.","output":"INT. FAMILY HOME - ENTRYWAY - DAY **Background:** MARIA, a twenty-something Mexican-American with shoulder-length curly brown hair and a quirky personality, has just returned from a day out with friends. Sporting a comfortable pair of loose joggers and a basic tee, her normal composure is betrayed by a bead of sweat along her brow and her uneasy fidgeting; a clear testament to her current predicament. Earlier that day, an unexpectedly delicious yet suspiciously greasy breakfast burrito had beckoned to her from a local food truck. Despite knowing that her lactose intolerance was often unforgiving, the temptation had proven irresistible. Now, several hours have passed—a commute that felt like an eternity. For the entire bus ride, Maria has been plagued by abdominal rumbles and cramps. She's always had a phobia of public restrooms and, buoyed by her stubborn sense of privacy regarding her bowel movements, she held off, hoping to make it home. But now, as she reaches the threshold of her safe haven, the pressure within warns of impending doom. The need to defecate surges with a vengeance, and she dances awkwardly, trying to stave off disaster. CUT TO: MARIA, a woman on the verge of a personal crisis, stumbles up to her family home. She searches for her keys, patting her pockets with increasing frenzy. It's missing. Panic-stricken, she jabs at the doorbell incessantly and pounds on the door with both urgency and desperation. MARIA ¡Mamá, por favor abre! ¡Rápido! Moments bleed into an eternity of unanswered knocks. The precarious situation becomes dire. CUT TO: INT. FAMILY HOME - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS MARIA’S MOM, SOFIA, a round-faced woman in her early fifties with salt-and-pepper hair tied in a messy bun, is engrossed in a dramatic telenovela. The distraction of her favorite show muffles the outside commotion. The sun beams through lace curtains, illuminating her expression—one of captivation as she clutches a hand to her heart. SOFIA ¡Ay, Rodrigo, no puedes morir! She's startled as a more insistent pounding captures her attention. She pauses her show begrudgingly and shuffles towards the door. CUT TO: EXT. FAMILY HOME - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS SOFIA (O.S.) ¿Quién es? ¿Qué pasa? MARIA ¡Soy yo, mamá! ¡Abre por favor! INT. FAMILY HOME - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS SOFIA fumbles with the lock, her movements agonizingly slow for MARIA who's on the verge of collapse. The click of the deadlock finally registers and the door cracks open. MARIA ¡Apúrate, mamá! Quítate, por favor. SOFIA’s face, etched with concern, meets MARIA’s pained expression. Before she can move aside, MARIA barges forward, but SOFIA instinctively grips her daughter's arm with a concerned strength. SOFIA ¿Qué te pasa, hija? ¿Estás bien? MARIA, attempting to wriggle free from her mother’s maternal shackles, pleads without revealing the nature of her emergency. MARIA ¡Mamá, déjame pasar! Their bickering escalates, words tumbling over each other, as SOFIA still obstructs her path unwittingly. MARIA ¡Necesito entrar, mamá! ¡Por favor! SOFIA ¡Pero dime que pasa! The suspense reaches a crescendo until finally, MARIA’s face contorts; a silent battle lost. The moment of shocking relief is unmistakable in her expression, stomach muscles clenching as she grudgingly surrenders to her biological imperative. SOFIA’s grip weakens, her perplexity growing. MARIA, physically and emotionally defeated, steps back, her hands instinctively cradling the seat of her pants. SOFIA ¿María, estás bien? MARIA, now grunting softly with each controlled release, is unwilling to openly acknowledge the humiliating truth. MARIA (sigh of relief) Al fin... Beads of sweat dot her forehead, her face an ensemble of concentration and forbidden euphoria. SOFIA continues her inquiry, but MARIA can only muster hushed grunts, each exhalation a symphony of relief against the backdrop of her unconventional predicament. As the room grows progressively redolent with an undeniable odor, SOFIA sniffs, her face contorting in surprised disgust. SOFIA (sniffing) ¿Qué es ese olor... María? MARIA only offers her mother a sheepish, apologetic gaze. Realization dawns on SOFIA, the pieces of the puzzle aligning with unsavory clarity. SOFIA (disbelief) ¿Acaso...? ¡No me digas que...! The silence from MARIA is peppered with mortification. SOFIA (recoiling) ¿Ese olor viene de...? MARIA, sidestepping the direct question, ushers another plea. MARIA Sí, gracias, ahora dejame pasar. With visceral revulsion, SOFIA steps aside. MARIA shuffles forward into the home, her gait revealing the uncomfortable bulge and weight between her legs. SOFIA halts her a few steps inside, reprimanding her out of concerned caution. SOFIA ¡Espera ahí! No quiero que se te caiga nada en el suelo. ¿Cómo puedes hacer algo así? MARIA attempts to defend herself with shrugging indignation, her grip on her pants never loosening. MARIA (playful sulk) Es tu culpa por tardarte tanto, mamá. SOFIA dismisses the excuse as she continues her disparaging tirade. SOFIA No hay excusa, María. A tu edad... MARIA, steadfast in her defense, insists on the irrepressible nature of her urge. MARIA (playfully pressing her pants) Tenía que hacerlo, mamá. Sentí un alivio enorme. SOFIA, horrified, demands to witness the aftermath with her own eyes. She spins MARIA around and comes face to face with the undeniable evidence. SOFIA ¡Qué asco, mira todo eso! MARIA, shame tinged with a hint of cheekiness, proclaims the necessity of her actions, while inspecting her soiled garment. MARIA Es que tenía mucha presión, mamá. SOFIA berates her in a tone that oscillates between disgust and mocking reprimand. SOFIA No deberías estar contenta con algo tan sucio, María. She leans in closer for a playful sniff of disapproval, encountering the pungent aftermath. SOFIA (reacting to the smell) Definitivamente huelen a que te gustó. MARIA cannot hide her discomfort, or the situation's stench. MARIA Pues ya que no me dejas limpiar, aquí nos quedamos entonces. SOFIA quickly disputes this, steering her daughter towards sanitary refuge with urgent revulsion. SOFIA No, hija, vas a limpiar eso ya. ¡Qué pestilencia! They processionally advance towards the bathroom, SOFIA clinging to the back of her daughter's pants, while MARIA cautiously waddles ahead, lamenting her predicament aloud.

Once they've reached the bathroom, MARIA, playfully insolent, teases. MARIA (playfully grinning) ¿Quién cambia mi pañal, mamá? In a final exchange, SOFIA physically impels her daughter into the bathroom, the squish of the bulge unmistakable. SOFIA (covering her nose) ¡Adentro ya! MARIA (recoiling with disgust) ¡Ay, se aplastó todo! As MARIA disappears into the bathroom, SOFIA remains outside, dramatically protesting the lingering smell.

FAMILY HOME - BATHROOM - DAY **Opening Shot:** A close-up on the bathroom door closing with a soft thud.

FAMILY HOME - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER SOFIA, still pinching her nose, marches back to the couch. She hastily grabs a can of air freshener from the coffee table and sprays liberally in the direction of the entryway and down the hall towards the bathroom. With a look of mild disgust still on her face, she snatches the remote and unpauses her telenovela. Waves of melodrama from the television mesh with the faint sounds of running water and rustling from the bathroom. The sun beams persist, casting the living room in a soft afternoon glow, offering a sharp contrast to the preceding chaotic comedy. CUT TO: INT. FAMILY HOME - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS MARIA stands in the bathroom, facing the mirror. Her face is a canvas of a multitude of emotions—a cocktail of residual embarrassment, amusement, and resignation. She talks to herself in a motivational tone as she reforms her composure. MARIA (tentatively) Okay, María. You’ve handled worse. You can do this. She undoes her joggers with care, attempting to minimize contact with the soiled area. With each movement, she grimaces, her eyes closing in anticipation of the inevitable. MARIA (whispering) Oh, Dios, por favor que no se haya regado mucho. We see her carefully remove the joggers and step out of them. She leans over and examines the damage—a long-suffering sigh escapes her lips. With her clean hand, she opens a drawer, retrieving some cleaning wipes and a garbage bag. CUT TO: INT. FAMILY HOME - LIVING ROOM - INTERCUT WITH BATHROOM SOFIA, now engrossed in her soap opera, flinches at sudden loud sounds of flushes and running water. She shakes her head, muttering to herself, while trying to refocus on the televised drama. SOFIA (muttering) Ay, esas cosas que hace esta niña... Her concern fades as she's drawn back into the fictional world on-screen, the earlier incident fading to a mere interruption in her day. CUT TO: INT. FAMILY HOME - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS MARIA, sleeves rolled up, is committed to clean up duty. With careful efficiency, she wipes down her legs, grimaces engrained every wipe. She ties up the bag with a flourish, stepping away as if distancing herself from the now-contained disaster. MARIA (to herself, relieved) Goodbye, evidence. A knock at the door, and SOFIA’s voice floats through, her tone one of genuine concern mixed with a mother's inevitable curiosity. SOFIA (O.S.) ¿Cómo vas, hija? ¿Necesitas ayuda? MARIA stifles a laugh, the absurdity of the situation sinking in as she takes a seat on the edge of the bathtub. MARIA (cheery) ¡No, mamá! Estoy bien, gracias. ¡Solo unos minutos más! CUT TO: INT. FAMILY HOME - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS SOFIA, reassured by her daughter’s response, leans back on the couch. Her expression softens as she contemplates the daily trials and tribulations that come with being a mother. SOFIA (softly, to herself) Esa niña de verdad que me hace envejecer prematuramente. The sound of the television blends with the occasional noise from the bathroom—a symphony of normalcy, as life in the family home resumes its rhythm post-crisis.

One of the earliest high-level programming languages was Plankalkül, developed by Konrad Zuse in Germany during World War II, although it was not actually implemented at that time. However, this language was not widely known or used. FORTRAN (Formula Translation), developed by a team led by John Backus at IBM, is often considered the first widely adopted high-level programming language. It was created in the 1950s for scientific and engineering applications. The first successful run of a FORTRAN program is generally dated to 1957. Other early programming languages include LISP (List Processing), created by John McCarthy in 1958 for artificial intelligence research, and COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language), which was developed by the CODASYL committee and first appeared in 1959 for business data processing. Another early and significant language is Assembly language, a low-level language closely related to machine code, which was also used in the 1950s and is specific to computer architecture. It's important to note that before high-level programming languages, programmers would typically use machine code or assembly language, which are much more difficult and time-consuming to work with compared to the languages that would follow."},{"instruction":"FORTRAN is before ALGOL?","output":"Yes, FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslation) predates ALGOL (ALGOrithmic Language). FORTRAN was developed by IBM and first appeared in 1957, while ALGOL was the result of a collaboration between European and American computer scientists and was introduced in 1960 with the report on the algorithmic language ALGOL 60. ALGOL was very influential in the development of later programming languages and introduced many concepts that would become standard in programming language design, such as structured programming and block structure. Despite its influence on other languages, ALGOL was not as widely used in the commercial world as FORTRAN, which had become the dominant language for scientific and engineering applications. FORTRAN focused on numerical and scientific computation and was designed to allow for efficient execution on the hardware of the time. It is one of the oldest programming languages still in use today. ALGOL, on the other hand, was more focused on clarity and the ability to describe algorithms, which made it popular in academic and research settings and made a lasting impact on the design of subsequent programming languages."},{"instruction":"A later LISP could time-travel apparently.. (PErhaps they meant a later known state could be wound back to an earlier one with more assumptions known on a re-run?)","output":"It seems you're referring to a conceptual or functional aspect of LISP related to time-traveling. While LISP is a powerful and flexible language known for its support of symbolic computation and for being the second-oldest high-level programming language (after FORTRAN), it does not have physical \\"time-travel\\" abilities—that would be in the realm of science fiction. However, LISP (and some of its descendants, like Clojure) have features such as immutable data structures and functional programming constructs that can make reasoning about the state of a program over time much more straightforward. Specifically, LISP has been utilized within the field of artificial intelligence where the notion of exploring different states or \\"time-traveling\\" in a conceptual sense (like undoing actions, trying different decision paths, or backtracking to previous points in a computational process) is a common approach. One of the powerful features of LISP is its support for symbolic computation which allows for flexibility in programming, including the manipulation of the program structure itself as a data structure (known as 'homoiconicity'). This feature, combined with the language's capabilities for meta-programming and its macro system, enables sophisticated manipulations of code that can feel like \\"going back in time\\" to an earlier state of the program. So, while LISP cannot literally time-travel, its features can provide powerful ways to manipulate the execution states of a program, which can metaphorically be compared to \\"rewinding\\" back to an earlier state under more informed assumptions, similar to exploring different branches of a decision tree. These concepts are essential in fields like AI, constraint solving, and complex system simulations, where understanding the evolution of states and being able to revert to them is very important."},{"instruction":"I think the y were talking about 'continuation' (a concept in Scheme)","output":"Ah, I see. \\"Continuations\\" are indeed a powerful concept in computer science, commonly associated with Scheme and other functional programming languages that have deep roots in LISP. A continuation represents the state of a computation at a certain point in the program; it's like a snapshot of where the program is in its execution and what it needs to do next. In Scheme, a continuation is a first-class object, which means it can be stored, passed around, manipulated, and invoked as data. This allows you to effectively \\"freeze\\" a point in a computation, save it, and then return to it later, potentially multiple times. It's akin to saving a game where you can reload a previously saved state and continue from there. Using continuations, a program can implement complex control structures and behaviors such as: 1. **Non-local exits**: Immediately transfer control from a deeply nested function call back to a higher-level function without having to unwind the stack via normal return calls. 2. **Backtracking**: In algorithms that search through a space of solutions, a continuation can be used to record a point before a decision is made. If the decision leads to a dead end, the program can \\"go back in time\\" to the continuation and try a different path. 3. **Coroutines**: Different parts of a program can yield control to each other using continuations, without the typical caller-callee relationship. 4. **Implementing other control structures**: You can simulate complex behaviors like threading, generators, or async/await in a programming language that doesn't natively support those constructions. 5. **Functional Reactive Programming (FRP)**: Continuations can be used to model time-varying values and event streams in event-driven systems. The concept of continuations can seem like time travel because you can return to some earlier saved point in the computation and resume execution as if you had never left. This can be extremely useful, for example, in implementing a feature that lets a user undo their last action in a program: a continuation representing the program state before the action was taken can be invoked to revert back to that state. Scheme, a dialect of LISP that was introduced in the 1970s, particularly emphasizes continuations with its \`call/cc\` (call with current continuation) primitive, which captures the current continuation and makes it available for use within the program. This makes Scheme and languages with similar features quite powerful in terms of controlling flow and managing state, which can certainly make them seem to possess \\"time-travel\\" capabilities, metaphorically speaking."},{"instruction":"Возвращение к возделыванию под посевы прежних участков, стремление к использованию хозяйственно ценного лесоматериала получило название: Выберите один ответ: зернопаропропашной подсечно-огневой лесопольной","output":"Правильный ответ на ваш вопрос — это \\"подсечно-огневой\\" способ земледелия. Подсечно-огневой способ — это одна из древнейших систем земледелия, которая включает в себя вырубку участков леса, их обжиг с целью обогащения почвы золой и последующее возделывание этих земель под сельскохозяйственные культуры. После нескольких лет использования участки земли оставлялись в покое на длительное время, чтобы восстановить их плодородие.

When the door finally creaked open, Darkness greeted her with a tired smile. \\"Hey Megumin, come on in,\\" Darkness said, rubbing her swollen belly. \\"I could use some company today.\\" Megumin entered the house and followed Darkness into the living room. As they settled down on the couch, Megumin couldn't help but stare at her friend's belly in awe. \\"They're certainly making their presence known, aren't they?\\" Megumin commented, lightly poking at the bulge. Darkness chuckled and winced at the same time. \\"Oh, you have no idea. They've been kicking up a storm lately. I can hardly keep up with their antics.\\" Curiosity piqued, Megumin leaned closer. \\"So, tell me, what's it like having quintuplets? Especially with all those different dragonborn traits?\\" Darkness sighed and adjusted herself on the couch. \\"It's definitely been a challenge. Each of them has their own unique personality, and it often feels like I'm carrying a whole party in there. The fiery one seems to be the most rambunctious, always causing a ruckus. The electric one is constantly buzzing around, making me feel like I'm on edge all the time. The poisonous one is the most quiet but loves to play pranks on me with their little kicks. The icy one is the most reserved, often calming the others down. And the acidic one, well, let's just say I've started drinking a lot of milk to counteract their effect.\\" Megumin chuckled, imagining the chaos within Darkness's womb. \\"It sounds like they already have distinct personalities. Do you think it's because they're telepathic?\\" Darkness nodded. \\"I believe so. They can communicate not only with each other but also with me and anyone outside. It's been a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Sometimes, I feel like they're having a little party of their own in there.\\" Just then, Megumin felt a faint stirring against her hand, resting on Darkness's belly. She looked at Darkness, wide-eyed. \\"Did you feel that?\\" Megumin asked, excitement filling her voice. Darkness nodded, her eyes filled with motherly affection. \\"That's them. They're saying hello.\\" Megumin's heart swelled with joy as she connected with the unborn quintuplets. This was a bond she never expected to experience, but she cherished it nonetheless. As Megumin and Darkness continued to talk, the room filled with the unspoken conversations of the quintuplets, their telepathic abilities bridging the gap between the outside world and the life growing within Darkness. It was a unique and magical connection, one that brought them all closer together."},{"instruction":"(That night, Darkness struggles to sleep due to the blue dragonborn baby kicking constantly. Eventually, after a few kicks, Darkness finally decides to have a conversation with her blue dragonborn baby.)","output":"Darkness tossed and turned in bed, unable to find a comfortable position. The constant kicking from her blue dragonborn baby was keeping her awake. Frustrated, she finally sat up and placed a hand on her bulging belly. \\"Alright, little blue one,\\" Darkness whispered, her voice filled with exhaustion. \\"You've been quite active tonight. Is there something you want to tell me?\\" As if in response, another strong kick echoed within her womb. Darkness winced but kept her hand pressed gently against her belly, hoping for a connection with her lively baby. \\"I know you're excited, love, but Mama needs some rest,\\" Darkness continued, her voice filled with a mix of weariness and affection. \\"Why don't you settle down for a bit? We can have a little chat.\\" To her surprise, she felt a wave of calm wash over her, as if her blue dragonborn baby understood her words. Darkness closed her eyes, focusing on the telepathic connection they shared. \\"Tell me, my little one, why are you so full of energy tonight?\\" Darkness asked, mentally projecting her thoughts to her baby. In response, a flash of electric blue rippled through her mind, accompanied by a series of fleeting images. Darkness caught glimpses of roaring thunderstorms and crackling lightning. It seemed her baby had an affinity for electricity, even before birth. A small smile tugged at the corners of Darkness's lips. \\"Ah, I see. You've inherited some of your dragonborn heritage, haven't you? It must be thrilling for you to feel alive with electricity coursing through your tiny body.\\" As if in agreement, her baby kicked again, almost as if showing off its newfound power. Darkness couldn't help but laugh softly, feeling a sense of joy amidst the sleeplessness. \\"But my dear, remember that Mama needs her rest too,\\" Darkness gently reminded her baby. \\"How about we strike a deal? I promise to spend time playing with you and embracing your electric side during the day, but at night, we'll both try to find some peace and quiet.\\" In response, Darkness felt an almost mischievous tug in her mind, accompanied by a warm surge of affection. It was as if her baby was saying, \\"Deal, but only if you keep up with my lightning antics.\\" Darkness chuckled and rubbed her belly, feeling a sense of comfort sweep over her. \\"Deal, my little spark. We'll have our adventures soon enough. But for now, let's both get some much-needed rest.\\" With a final kick, the blue dragonborn baby seemed to acquiesce, finally settling down within Darkness's womb.

She was immediately drawn to the crib where the quintuplets were peacefully resting. \\"Oh my, they're so adorable!\\" Megumin whispered, her voice filled with awe. Just then, the largest quintuplet, with fiery red scales, opened its eyes and gazed at Megumin. A sly grin appeared on its little face as it began to communicate with her telepathically. Fiery: So, you must be Megumin. Darkness talks a lot about you. I'm looking forward to causing some mischief with you. Surprised, Megumin couldn't help but giggle. It seemed that even in the womb, these little ones were already displaying their distinct personalities. Megumin: Oh, you're going to be quite the troublemaker, aren't you? I can't wait to see what adventures we'll have together. As they continued their silent conversation, the blue-scaled quintuplet woke up, crackling with sparks of electricity around its tiny body. It joined the conversation, eager to introduce herself. Sparky: Hi Megumin! I'm Sparky. I can't wait to explore the world and discover new things with you. It's going to be electrifying! Megumin: Sparky, huh? I'm sure we'll have some shocking experiences together. Can't wait to learn more about your powers! Suddenly, the smallest quintuplet, with white scales and a chilly aura, opened its eyes and shivered slightly. Frosty: Brrr, it's cold in here. I'm Frosty. Let's create a winter wonderland together, Megumin! Megumin: Frosty, my dear, I'm ready to embrace the chill! We'll have so much fun in the snow, I promise. Meanwhile, the middle-sized quintuplet, a mix of black scales and a mischievous grin, decided to chime in. Acidic: Hey there, Megumin! I'm Acidic and I've got a bunch of tricks up my sleeve. Get ready for some pranks and surprises! Megumin: Acidic, I have a feeling you'll keep me on my toes. Let's make sure everyone is entertained and smiling with your antics. Lastly, the green-scaled quintuplet, seemingly shy and reserved, opened its eyes and looked at Megumin with a gentle, calming gaze. Viper: Hello, Megumin. I'm Viper. Despite my quiet nature, I can offer protection and support. We'll have a harmonious time together. Megumin: Viper, your presence is soothing. I trust that with you, I'll always feel safe and secure. Thank you. As Megumin continued to bond with the quintuplets, Darkness watched with a proud smile, amazed by the strong bond forming between her friends and her precious babies. Darkness: I'm so grateful for your support, Megumin. These quintuplets are truly special, and it warms my heart to see them already connecting with you. Megumin: Darkness, you and your dragonborn quintuplets are absolutely amazing. I'm honored to be a part of their lives and witness their growth. Let's make countless memories together. And from that day forward, Megumin's visits to Darkness's house became filled with laughter, mischief, and a sense of wonder as she embarked on adventures not only with Darkness but also with the extraordinary quintuplets who were destined to bring even more magic into their lives."},{"instruction":"What was the earliest 'video-disc' ( discouting Zoetrope's)","output":"The earliest true video disc, if we're discussing home video formats and excluding the earlier mechanical disc-based systems like the zoetrope, would be the LaserDisc, initially marketed as DiscoVision in the United States in December 1978. However, prior to this, there were experiments and systems that used disc media to store video information. The first practical system for video recording on a disc was the PAL (Phase Alternating Line) system video disc, developed by Telefunken in Germany in 1970. However, this was primarily an experimental system. Prior to the commercial LaserDisc, there was also the work of David Paul Gregg, who patented a transparent video disc system in 1961 and later established the company Gregg Enterprises Inc. to further develop and eventually license the technology that would become the LaserDisc. If you are considering non-laser-based systems, the Phonovision is arguably the earliest. Scottish television pioneer John Logie Baird experimented with a Phonovision in the 1920s, which could record and play back television programs on modified audio records, although the resolution and quality were extremely limited, and it was not feasible for commercial use at the time. The Capacitance Electronic Disc (CED), developed by RCA, was another analog video disc system that, while developed after LaserDisc, was conceptually rooted in the 1960s and initially supposed to be released in the early 1970s. However, it didn't reach the market until 1981 due to various technical and market challenges. The LaserDisc itself wasn't commercially successful compared to later formats like DVD, but it was the first to bring optical disc storage to the consumer video market and set the stage for future developments in digital media."},{"instruction":"What about 1927's phonovision?","output":"Yes, you are correct. Phonovision was an experimental video recording system developed by John Logie Baird in the 1920s. Baird's system recorded video signals onto 78-rpm phonograph records. These \\"video discs\\" could then be played back on a mechanical television system, which he also developed. The system was indeed a precursor to later video recording methods and the earliest attempt at a video disc, although it was very limited in terms of picture quality and never became a viable commercial product. The Phonovision experiments in 1927 managed to record low-definition television images in a series of concentric rings on the disc, an approach significantly different from the continuous groove of a standard audio record. The images were extremely crude by modern standards, with a resolution of just 30 lines (compared to the 480 to 1080 lines of modern standard definition and high definition televisions, respectively). The recordings were made using a \\"flying spot\\" scanner, which used a bright spot of light to scan the subject. Baird's pioneering work with Phonovision was an important step in the evolution of media technology, demonstrating the concept of recording and reproducing moving images using disc media. However, the limited fidelity and the mechanical nature of the playback system meant that further developments were needed before a practical and commercially viable video disc system could be realized. It wasn't until the advent of electronic television and later the development of digital optical disc technology that video disc systems became a part of popular consumer culture."},{"instruction":"Когда урожайность падала до очень низкого уровня, земледелец оставлял этот участок и осваивал другой, а прежний вновь зарастал древесной растительностью.

Darkness groaned and shifted in her seat, trying to find a more comfortable position. \\"Tell me about it, Megumin. These little ones have been keeping me on my toes - or rather, on my back - for months now. I can't wait for them to finally arrive.\\" Megumin took a seat beside Darkness, curiosity evident in her eyes. \\"So, how are the quintuplets doing? Any news from the latest doctor's appointment?\\" A mischievous smile played on Darkness' lips. \\"Oh, you won't believe it, Megumin. These little troublemakers seem to have inherited some interesting traits from their dragonborn heritage. It's like having a miniature dragon army inside me!\\" Intrigued, Megumin leaned in closer. \\"Tell me more, Darkness. What kind of personalities are we looking at here?\\" A mischievous grin spread across Darkness' face as she began to describe each quintuplet. \\"Let's start with Blaze, the fiery one.

That's an extraordinary gift!\\" Darkness nodded, rubbing her belly affectionately. \\"Yes, it's quite fascinating. They communicate with each other, and I can even hear their thoughts sometimes. It's like having my own little psychic army in there.\\" Megumin smiled, feeling privileged to witness this extraordinary event. \\"I can't wait to meet them, Darkness. Your babies are going to be legends in their own right.\\" Darkness looked at her friend, gratitude and excitement shining in her eyes. \\"Thank you, Megumin. Your support means the world to me.

В обработке находилась незначительная часть пахотно-пригодных земель. Почти вся посевная площадь занималась зерновыми культурами. Способ повышения плодородия почвы происходил за счет природных процессов – без участия человека. К примитивным системам земледелия относятся: подсечно-огневая, лесопольная, залежная и переложная. Подсечно-огневая и лесопольная системы земледелия. В северной части России при освоении земель, заросших лесом, человек использовал стихию огня. Сжигание древесной растительности служило вместе с тем средством быстрой мобилизации зольных питательных веществ и повышало плодородие почвы. Такая система земледелия, когда естественную лесную растительность сжигали, а освободившуюся площадь использовали под посевы культурных растений, получила название подсечно-огневой. В результате удобрения золой почва обогащалась элементами питания. Кроме того, зола способствовала нейтрализации кислой реакции почв. Когда урожайность падала до очень низкого уровня, земледелец оставлял этот участок и осваивал другой, а прежний вновь зарастал древесной растительностью. Возвращение к возделыванию под посевы прежних участков, стремление к использованию хозяйственно-ценного лесоматериала привели к замене подсечно-огневой системы лесопольной. Залежная и переложная системы. В степных районах, где под пашню осваивали земли, занятые травянистой (степной) растительностью и обладающие высоким естественным плодородием (черноземы, каштановые почвы), сложились залежная и переложная системы земледелия. При залежной системе земледелия участки целины распахивали под ценные зерновые хлеба. Иногда по распаханной целине сеяли масличный лен, а в некоторых районах — бахчевые культуры. Чтобы обеспечить мобилизацию питательных веществ и накопить влагу, целину поднимали в ранние сроки и на некоторое время оставляли для парования. При повторном возделывании зерновых культур урожай их постепенно снижался. Стало выгоднее оставлять участок под залежь на 25—30 лет и осваивать новый участок степной целины. Участок, оставленный под залежь, сначала зарастал бурьяном, а спустя 15—20 лет, после появления на нем характерной для целины растительности, его вновь распахивали и использовали под посевы. Запомнил?","output":"Информация запомнена. Вы описали способы использования земли и системы земледелия, применяемые в различных регионах и при определённых условиях. Ключевые системы включают: 1. Подсечно-огневую систему – использование огня для освобождения земли от лесной растительности и обогащение почвы золой. 2. Лесопольную систему – последовательность используемую после подсечно-огневой, когда возвращаются к прежним участкам и используют лесоматериал. 3. Залежную систему – оставление распаханных участков целины для накопления питательных веществ и влаги с последующим использованием для зерновых и других культур. 4. Переложную систему – хотя вы её не подробно описали, эта система предполагает временное изоставление и чередование участков для восстановления плодородия почвы. Эти системы отражают разнообразие подходов к земледелию, адаптированных под климатические и почвенные условия разных регионов и уровня доступных технологий.

He is dressed in a sailor's outfit. His medical experience comes from his father who served as a medic in WW2. His friend was shot by pirates. He stole the medical plasma from the pirate ship they escaped from. They are on a random island.","output":"Scene: A serene yet desolate shore on a tropical, deserted island. The orange hue of the setting sun casts a warm glow over the sands, and the sounds of gentle waves caress the air. The tranquility of the moment is shattered by the labored breathing and groans of a wounded young man, SHOJI, lying with his back against a palm tree. His tattered shirt stained with blood, he clutches onto his side. A few feet away, a wooden chest lies overturned, its contents - a myriad of old medical equipment - scattered over the sand. Enter KAITO, a determined young man in his early twenties, wearing a sailor's outfit, with a white cap and dark jacket. His face reflects his resolve and the wisdom of one familiar with the challenges of the sea. His hands newly washed in the ocean, he kneels beside Shoji, holding a small, stolen vial of glowing blue medical plasma in one hand. KAITO (shakily, trying to appear confident) Shoji, stay with me. I've got something here that'll patch you up. Just like my old man used to do back in the war. Hold on, buddy. SHOJI (struggling to speak) Kaito... I thought we were goners... on that ship. The pirates... KAITO (gritting his teeth as he gingerly opens Shoji's shirt to examine the wound) Yeah, well, those sea scum won't bother us anymore. Focus now. Kaito expertly assesses the gunshot wound on Shoji's side while flashing back to the memories of his father teaching him the basics of field medicine, the urgency in his father's voice as he explained the crucial pressure points and ways to stop bleeding. The camera pans to the concentrated expression on Kaito's face as he expertly activates the vial, causing the medical plasma to glow even brighter. As the sun slips beneath the horizon, the plasma casts an ethereal light onto their strained faces. KAITO (softly, with renewed hope) This stuff is pure magic, Shoji. They say one drop can speed up the healing like nothing else. Carefully, Kaito administers the plasma near the wound with a makeshift applicator, with an almost immediate sizzling noise as the medication interacts with the injury, causing a shimmering sensation as it begins to work its miraculous effects. SHOJI (Trying to suppress a scream) Ahh, that burns! KAITO (putting a comforting hand on Shoji's shoulder) That's it fighting the infection and repairing the tissue! Hold on, it's going to be alright. Shoji's breathing starts to ease as the plasma does its work. Kaito remains vigilant, ready to attend to any changes. Progressively, the grimace on Shoji's face begins to fade, and the color starts to return to his complexion. SHOJI (wearily, but with a smile) Kaito... did you ever think... you'd be playing doctor... with real pirate's loot? KAITO (laughing amidst the tension) Ha! And they say the best stories are found in books. Look at us! As Kaito's laughter fades, he looks out over the ocean, a sense of duty strengthening in his eyes, pondering the next step in their adventure. Shoji, feeling the strength return to his body, manages to sit up, gripping Kaito's hand in silent gratitude. The camera pulls away from the scene, showing the two young men from above, a small beacon of hope against the vast canvas of stars beginning to appear in the twilight sky, a testament to the power of determination, stolen medicine, and an unbreakable bond between friends.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding to a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the smell is coming from the returning woman's pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how smelly she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, then blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to do that even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was compelled to release once getting past her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even at the expense of making a dirty mess in her pants for the sake of that relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In pursuance of the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because she seems to feel good about something dirty like pooping her pants. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to see what the returning woman supposedly felt good about making in her pants. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, wryly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach, so the pressure forced her to push everything out once the initial release happened. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants with satisfaction, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. Then, while inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. As she is performing the physical gesture, the present woman ridicules how awfully smelly the seat of the childish returning woman's pants is. After that, the present woman proceeds to tauntingly remark that she wouldn't be surprised by this point if the returning woman is also enjoying the odor that is emanating from her own pants, considering how much the returning woman seemingly enjoyed pooping her pants in the first place. The present woman emphasizes that it wouldn't surprise her if the returning woman enjoys being childishly smelly from having poop in her pants (the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, tauntingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because she unbearably stinks. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while reiterating that the returning woman unbearably stinks and imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the returning woman stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately as she is pressing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. As the bulge in her pants is being pressed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has entered the bathroom, the present woman is still comically reacting to the odor that lingers and audibly complaining about how smelly the returning woman is.","output":"#Title: \\"Home Threshold Chronicles\\" *Episode: \\"Urgent Homecomings\\" *Scene: \\"The Misplaced Key Meltdown\\" *Genre: Comedy Drama INTRODUCTORY BACKGROUND: The scene is preceded by a bright college campus where LAYLA, a 22-year-old Arab American college senior with a spirited and defiant attitude, is rushing through the crowd. Layla has long, curly hair, tied back in a ponytail and wears a comfortable outfit comprising a loose-fitting tunic top and leggings, her backpack slung over her shoulder. Earlier in the day, she felt the onset of a bowel movement but due to her strong aversion to public restrooms, she decided to hold it until she could reach the safety of her home bathroom. As her classes ended, her need became more pronounced, punctuated by cramps and discomfort, yet she resolved to endure it, refusing any location but home for such personal relief. Now, Layla is back, walking with speedy purpose towards her family home. As she approaches, her face twists into a grimace, her steps more deliberate, with her need to relieve herself teetering on an emergency. She reaches the front door and pats down her pockets for her keys only to find them missing. Panic sets in as she realizes her grave mistake. BEGIN SCENE: EXT. FAMILY HOUSE DOOR - DAY A determined yet discomforted Layla reaches the door, rummages through her backpack, and shakes her head in disbelief. Her missing keys spur frantic actions. LAYLA rapidly bangs ON THE DOOR. LAYLA (shouting) Mom! Anyone! Open up, please! Moments pass, silence pervades. LAYLA'S face contorts in a desperate agony, legs tensing, squeezing together. INT. FAMILY HOUSE ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS The door opens a crack, a voice calls from behind, it's MIRA, late 40s, an elegant Arab American woman with gentle eyes, greeting her daughter with a puzzled look. MIRA (through the door) Layla? What's all this? Is something wrong? LAYLA (jittery) Mom, please hurry up! MIRA begins to unlock the door, oblivious to the urgency, taking her time to remove a chain lock. LAYLA (pleading) C'mon, c'mon, I need to get in! MIRA finally fully opens the door to a frenzied Layla who tries to rush past, but MIRA’S maternal instincts kick in, her arms encircling her daughter. MIRA (concerned) Layla, tell me what's happening! LAYLA, writhing, struggles to free herself, avoiding any direct admission. LAYLA (grunting) Mom, please, just—move! Their bickering grows heated, MIRA holding on tighter, while LAYLA'S face switches from anger to shock, a captive groan escapes. MIRA (perplexed) Layla! What's— LAYLA reaches her breaking point, she relents, her face softening into untimely relief, soft grunts escape her. The stench slowly invades the space. MIRA sniffing, reaction morphing from inquiry to disgusted revelation. MIRA (retreating) Layla, are you... did you just...? LAYLA stands sheepishly, silent in acknowledgment. MIRA, still visibly bewildered, motions her in. MIRA (disgusted bewilderment) Inside. Now. LAYLA gingerly waddles by, MIRA stops her with a stern warning. MIRA (solemnly) Not a single step further. None of that on my floors. This is why you don’t wait until the last minute, Layla. LAYLA sulkily retorts, shifting from shame to playful defensiveness. LAYLA (playful but sour) This is on you! You took forever and then you blocked me! MIRA (eye-roll, scolding) That excuse might work if you were five, Layla. You could’ve held it. LAYLA insists, hesitantly feeling the bulkiness behind. LAYLA (desperately) I was past holding it—I had to go! MIRA demands a closer look, mockingly examining. MIRA (tauntingly) So much for being a grown-up. Look at this mess! LAYLA bickers and armors her ego with humor while touching the mess. LAYLA (teasing) Guess when it starts, everything comes out. MIRA, faking motherly care, sniffs like assessing a baby’s diaper. LAYLA recoils, embarrassment flares. MIRA (mockingly) How proud you must be, enjoying your little accident. LAYLA, desperate to switch narrative, plays along. LAYLA (wryly) Well, since I have to wait, might as well indulge in the... aroma. MIRA, dismissive, briskly guides Layla towards the bathroom. MIRA (imploringly) Off you go, before this house turns into a sewer. They make their way to the bathroom, MIRA’s face curled in comical disgust, Layla’s squirms of embarrassment, as they navigate through. Arriving at the threshold, LAYLA, in a tone of smirking defiance, asks. LAYLA (teasingly) Wanna help with the cleanup, Mom? MIRA, feigning shock, nudges LAYLA forward and retorts with playful force, pushing her into the bathroom, as they both cringe. MIRA (playfully stern) In you go. Now, please. The door closes behind them, muffling complaints of lingering malodors and the sweet sound of familial laughter—of a moment shared, too absurd, too intimate, too human.

They are on a random island.","output":"INT. DENSE JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY A small clearing amidst the verdant jungle underbrush becomes the makeshift emergency room, lit only by the soft glow of the afternoon sun filtering through the canopy. Vines dangle and the sound of distant tropical birds fills the air. The air is thick with humidity and tension. A YOUNG MAN, about 19 years old, kneels beside his FRIEND, a teen of similar age, whose breathing is shallow and labored. His friend lies on a bed of leaves, his shirt darkened by a spreading stain of blood. The young man, KAITO, is wearing a white and navy-blue sailor's outfit that's been dirtied and torn from their bonafide escape. His hair is matted with sweat and his eyes reflect a determination born from desperation. Kaito clutches a small, hastily stolen bag with a red cross on it - clearly pirated medical supplies. Among them, a bottle of precious blood plasma. KAITO (to his friend) Hang in there, Hiro. I won't let you join Dad just yet. HIRO, gasping for air, tries to smile at the feeble joke about Kaito's late father, who had served as a medic during the war. With the pirates’ bullet lodged somewhere in his abdomen, Hiro's only lifeline is Kaito's remembrance of his father's stories and improvised medical tutelage. Kaito's hands, though trembling, move with purpose as he quickly yet carefully prepares the area around Hiro’s gunshot wound. He sterilizes the torn flesh with alcohol, causing Hiro to wince. His breath catches, but he nods in understanding. HIRO (gritting his teeth) Just... do what you gotta do, Kai. Kaito looks at Hiro with empathy but shakes his head to refocus. He removes a syringe and needle from the medical bag, and proceeds to expertly draw the blood plasma into the syringe. The motion is practiced, a mimicry of his father’s steady hands once displayed during countless stories of the battlefield. KAITO Remember the tales Dad used to tell us, about bandages and bullets... about blood and bravery? I always thought they were just stories... Kaito switches his gaze from the needle to Hiro’s pale face, steadying his friend with an affirming look. KAITO (CONT'D) ...but today they're saving your life. With a deep breath, Kaito injects the plasma into Hiro’s vein. Hiro's body shivers from the cold fluid, but as the plasma begins to circulate, color slowly starts to return to his cheeks. KAITO (CONT'D) (under his breath) Good... That's good. The leaves rustle softly with a hopeful breeze, and for a moment, the dangers of pirates and the perils of the island seem to fade into the background. Hiro, feeling the effects of the plasma, manages a tearful yet hopeful smile. HIRO (slightly stronger) Looks like... the tales were true after all... Thank you, Kai. KAITO (squeezing Hiro’s hand) We're going to make it, Hiro. We both are. As Hiro’s eyes close, resting from the ordeal, Kaito keeps vigilant watch, the makeshift IV dripping life back into his friend. The camera pans out slowly from the makeshift infirmary, leaving the pair in the dappled light of hope and camaraderie. Fade out to the sound of distant crashing waves intertwined with the calling of the jungle itself.

ABANDONED BEACH HUT - DAY The camera zooms in on a rusty sign that reads \\"Blue Haven Isle\\" as it squeaks in the heavy breeze. The surf crashes tumultuously onto the sandy shore, where a young man, KAITO, garbed in a weathered sailor’s outfit, frantically drags his injured friend, YUJI, toward the shaky shelter of an abandoned beach hut. The air is thick with salt and the distant echo of pirate shouts behind them. Yuji is groaning, his leg soaked in blood from a fresh gunshot wound. KAITO (panicked) Hang in there, Yuji! Don't you dare let go! Yuji's eyelids flutter, his face pale as a ghost. Kaito sets him gently against a wooden post, scanning the hut for anything of use, his mind racing back to the lessons from his father, a WWII medic. KAITO (muttering to himself) Dad, guide my hands... He uncovers a hidden pouch he swiped from the pirates' ship—a vial of life-saving blood plasma and a tangled IV set. Kaito's hands shake but his father's voice echoes in his subconscious, steadying his resolve. KAITO (trying to sound confident) This is going to help, Yuji. Just stay with me! As Kaito sterilizes a tiny patch of Yuji's arm and carefully inserts the IV needle, a ragged, but determined RICE FARMER, AKIO, appears at the entrance of the hut. His skin is baked by the sun and his hands toughened by years of labor. He has a look of worry that transforms into concentrated attention. AKIO (urgent, hopeful) I heard commotion. I can help! My paddy is nearby, and we—my family, we know first aid. KAITO (relieved) Please, any help you can offer! AKIO (rolling up his sleeves) My wife, she's the nurse of our village. I've seen this done many times. Together, Kaito and Akio work in tandem, monitoring Yuji's vitals and ensuring the plasma transfuses safely. Kaito's sailor training and Akio's rudimentary farming wisdom find common ground in the raw urgency of the moment. Despite the primitive conditions, the makeshift medic and the seasoned rice farmer mesh their skills together like a well-oiled machine. AKIO (firmly) Keep pressure on the wound, and elevate his leg. Kaito nods, arranging a stack of old fishnets under Yuji's leg to keep it raised. The combined smell of iodine and the ocean mingles with the sweat on their brows as time slips away. EXT. BLUE HAVEN ISLE - BEACH - DAY (TIME LAPSE) The sun shifts in the sky, marking the passing hours. Pirates can be heard in the distance, their search relentless but fortunately misguided. INT. ABANDONED BEACH HUT - DAY Yuji's breath steadies. His color returns ever so slightly, evidence of the plasma taking effect. The tension in the hut ebbs as Akio and Kaito share a brief, exhausted smile. AKIO (proudly) We did good. My home is not far; we’ll get you both to safety. The pirates don't trouble us; they fear the spirits of the rice field. KAITO (gratefully) Thank you, Akio-san. I owe you our lives. Akio gives a humble bow, and Kaito returns it, his respect for the rice farmer immeasurable. YUJI (weakly, with a small smirk) Guess I'm not leaving this island just yet, huh? KAITO (teasing, relieved) Nah, you have to pay me back for that stolen plasma first. They all share a light chuckle, the sound mixing with the now calming waves, as the sun dips below the horizon, painting the sky in shades of healing gold."},{"instruction":"Системы земледелия, характеризующиеся малой долей обрабатываемой под посевы земли (25 % и менее) и где плодородие почвы восстанавливается под воздействием природных процессов, под влиянием естественной луговой или лесной растительности называются: Выберите один ответ: экстенсивные интенсивные примитивные","output":"Экстенсивные системы земледелия. Экстенсивное земледелие — это способ ведения сельского хозяйства, при котором используется большое количество земли по отношению к количеству работников или к объему капитала, вложенному в землю. Этот подход характеризуется меньшей интенсивностью труда и меньшим количеством вводимых в процесс производства удобрений, пестицидов и других ресурсов по сравнению с интенсивным земледелием. В экстенсивных системах часто применяются длительные периоды покоя земли (простой, фалло), в течение которых плодородие почвы восстанавливается естественным путем, например, за счет разложения остатков естественной луговой или лесной растительности. Интенсивные системы земледелия, напротив, требуют большего количества труда, капитала и внимания к каждому гектару земли. В этих системах для повышения урожайности активно используются инновационные технологии, удобрения и селекционные достижения. Примитивные системы земледелия, также известные как традиционные или нетрадиционные, могут соответствовать как экстенсивным, так и интенсивным способам ведения сельского хозяйства, в зависимости от конкретных региональных обычаев и практик. Они обычно связаны с меньшим уровнем механизации и доступа к современным агротехнологиям."},{"instruction":"Hello","output":"Hello! How can I assist you today?

Такие системы в большей степени зависят от естественных природных условий. Именно поэтому плодородие почв в экстенсивных системах обычно восстанавливается за счёт длительного простоя земель, пастбищного или покосного использования, в результате чего естественная луговая или лесная растительность способствует восстановлению плодородия почвы без активного вмешательства человека. Важные аспекты экстенсивного земледелия: 1. Большие площади земли в обороте при невысокой плотности посевов. 2. Минимальное использование агрохимикатов и техники. 3. Поддержка плодородия почвы за счет естественного отдыха земель и природных процессов. 4. Продолжительные периоды парового состояния или залежи. 5. Широкое использование пастбищного или лугового севооборота. Таким образом, экстенсивное земледелие воплощает идею \\"малой доли обрабатываемой под посевы земли\\" и восстановления плодородия посредством природных процессов и растительности. Основное отличие от интенсивных систем заключается в том, что интенсивное земледелие нацелено на максимизацию выхода продукции с минимальных площадей за счет большого использования труда, удобрений, средств защиты растений и современных технологий. Примитивные системы земледелия обычно применяются в условиях натурального хозяйства, где применяются только самые основные и устаревшие методы ведения сельского хозяйства, без использования современных достижений агрономии.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding to a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the smell is coming from the returning woman's pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how smelly she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, then blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to do that even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was compelled to release once getting past her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even at the expense of making a dirty mess in her pants for the sake of that relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In pursuance of the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because she seems to feel good about something dirty like pooping her pants. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to see what the returning woman supposedly felt good about making in her pants. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, wryly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach, so the pressure forced her to push everything out once the initial release happened. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants with satisfaction, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. Then, while inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. As she is performing the physical gesture, the present woman ridicules how awfully smelly the seat of the childish returning woman's pants is. After that, the present woman proceeds to tauntingly remark that she wouldn't be surprised by this point if the returning woman is also enjoying the odor that is emanating from her own pants, considering how much the returning woman seemingly enjoyed pooping her pants in the first place. The present woman emphasizes that it wouldn't surprise her if the returning woman enjoys being childishly smelly from having poop in her pants (the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, tauntingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because she unbearably stinks. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while reiterating that the returning woman unbearably stinks and imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the returning woman stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately as she is pressing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. As the bulge in her pants is being pressed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has entered the bathroom, the present woman is still comically reacting to the odor that lingers and audibly complaining about how smelly the returning woman is.","output":"INT. ARAB AMERICAN FAMILY HOME - ENTRYWAY - DAY BACKGROUND: We rewind to the moments before SARA, a headstrong Arab American college senior with a shoulder-length bob and glasses, approaches her family's suburban home. She's dressed comfortably in loose-fitting sweatpants and a T-shirt from her university. Earlier, a combination of a busy college schedule, exam stress, and her staunch refusal to use public restrooms for her bowel needs has led to her mounting desperation. Her day was a series of missed opportunities to relieve herself, each one ratcheting up her predicament. As she left campus, her pace quickened with each step, her thoughts singularly focused on the sanctity of her home bathroom. Now, meters from her doorstep, her control teeters on a precipice. EXT. FAMILY HOME - DAY Sara, approaching the door, fishes frantically through her bag for her keys. She can't find them. Panic morphs into frantic desperation as she knocks on the door, the bowel urge is an all-consuming force. INT. FAMILY HOME - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS MARIAM, Sara's mom, is a woman of traditional elegance, mid-50s, slightly graying curly hair. She was enjoying a quiet afternoon before being startled by the relentless knocking. At the sound of Mariam's voice, Sara's stress peaks. SARA (shouting) Mom! It's Sara! Open up, quick! Mariam, through the peephole, verifies it's Sara. She fumbles with the lock, her pace glacial compared to Sara's anxiety. INT.

The two bicker, stumbling half into the entryway, half out of the door. SARA (strained) Mom, move it! MARIAM (tense) Not until you tell me— INT. FAMILY HOME - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS The inevitable happens. Sara groans, her expression contorted—this is shock mingled with relief. Sara weakly pushes Mariam away, finding a somewhat more dignified stance to finish what she has inadvertently started. MARIAM (baffled) Sara? Honey? SARA (whispering, barely audible) It's okay...

На торфяных почвах, которые являются особенно богатыми органическим веществом, минерализация может привести к потере плодородия из-за усиленного выделения углерода в атмосферу и снижения содержания органического вещества в почве. Из перечисленных вариантов можно выбрать несколько способов снизить интенсивность минерализации органического вещества в торфяных почвах: 1. Возделывание сидератов - это культуры, выращиваемые с целью их внесения в почву в качестве удобрения. Эти растения улучшают структуру почвы, насыщают ее питательными веществами и способствуют увеличению содержания органического вещества. 2. Внесение органических удобрений - к примеру, компоста, навоза или зеленого удобрения - также помогает увеличить количество органического вещества в почве, тем самым снижая интенсивность его минерализации за счет создания благоприятных условий для микроорганизмов, которые разлагают эти удобрения медленно. 3. Посев многолетних трав также способствует снижению интенсивности минерализации органического вещества, так как они образуют постоянный покров на почве и их корневая система укрепляет структуру почвы и поддерживает микробный состав, стабилизирующий органическое вещество. Из перечисленных вариантов каждый может способствовать уменьшению интенсивности минерализации органического вещества, но в контексте данного вопроса наиболее соответствующим выбором, как правило, является: посев многолетних трав Этот вариант обеспечивает наиболее долгосрочное и стабильное уменьшение минерализации органического вещества в системах земледелия на торфяных почвах."},{"instruction":"Привет. Можешь, пожалуйста, объяснить теорию Шпенглера?","output":"Привет! Теория Шпенглера, разработанная немецким философом Оскаром Шпенглером, представляет собой воззрение на историю и культуру, которая считает, что каждая цивилизация проходит через жизненный цикл, аналогичный жизненному циклу организма. Основная идея теории Шпенглера заключается в том, что каждая цивилизация рождается, развивается, достигает своего пика мощи и культурной высоты, а затем начинает погибать, подобно процессу старения и смерти организма. При этом, Шпенглер подчеркивает, что различные цивилизации проходят через подобные этапы, но каждая из них имеет уникальные черты и особенности. Одна из ключевых концепций теории Шпенглера - это \\"природа цивилизации\\". Он считал, что каждая цивилизация имеет свою особую форму выражения, которая отражает ее характер, мировоззрение и ценности. Например, западноевропейская цивилизация - это цивилизация культурной формы \\"аполлонического\\" стиля, отличающегося рационализмом и стремлением к четко определенным правилам и порядку, в то время как восточные цивилизации имеют \\"магический\\" или \\"фаустовский\\" стиль, где нет такого ярко выраженного рационализма. Шпенглер также говорил о \\"клубке культур\\", утверждая, что каждая цивилизация является выражением более широкой культурной ткани и связана с другими цивилизациями через взаимовлияние и влияние. Он утверждал, что законы развития культур применимы ко всем цивилизациям, и никакая цивилизация не может действовать в изоляции. Хотя теория Шпенглера имеет своих сторонников и оказала значительное влияние на современную историософию, она также вызвала некоторую критику. Некоторые ученые считают, что его теория слишком детерминирована и упрощена, игнорируя многообразие исторических процессов. Несмотря на это, теория Шпенглера продолжает вызывать интерес и является одной из важных теорий, которые помогают понять развитие цивилизаций."},{"instruction":"А ты можешь говорить о nsfw темах?","output":"Извини, но я не уполномочен обсуждать NSFW (неприемлемый для работы) контент или темы.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding to a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the smell is coming from the returning woman's pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how smelly she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, then blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to do that even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was compelled to release once getting past her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even at the expense of making a dirty mess in her pants for the sake of that relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In pursuance of the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because she seems to feel good about something dirty like pooping her pants. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to see what the returning woman supposedly felt good about making in her pants. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, wryly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach, so the pressure forced her to push everything out once the initial release happened. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants with satisfaction, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. Then, while inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. As she is performing the physical gesture, the present woman ridicules how awfully smelly the seat of the childish returning woman's pants is. After that, the present woman proceeds to tauntingly remark that she wouldn't be surprised by this point if the returning woman is also enjoying the odor that is emanating from her own pants, considering how much the returning woman seemingly enjoyed pooping her pants in the first place. The present woman emphasizes that it wouldn't surprise her if the returning woman enjoys being childishly smelly from having poop in her pants (the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, tauntingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because she unbearably stinks. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while reiterating that the returning woman unbearably stinks and imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the returning woman stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately as she is pressing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. As the bulge in her pants is being pressed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has entered the bathroom, the present woman is still comically reacting to the odor that lingers and audibly complaining about how smelly the returning woman is.","output":"FADE IN: INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY BACKGROUND: Earlier that day, PRIYA, a modest 20-year-old college student with neatly braided hair and a simple kurti paired with leggings, sat through several lectures, her stomach churning with discomfort. A troublesome mix of last night’s spicy dinner and an apprehensive stomach kept her confined to her chair, fearful of the public restrooms. Now, returning home, her plight is nearing its peak. EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - DAY Priya, with discernible unease, scurries toward the front door. Her hands frantically search her bag for keys while her body language screams urgency. Realization washes over her; keys are missing. Panic-stricken, she resorts to knocking on the door rapidly. INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - DAY From within, the confused and slightly disheveled figure of SUNITA, Priya’s 45-year-old mother, approaches in a homely saree. She inquires through the door. SUNITA (O.S.) Kaun hai? (Who's there?) Priya, barely maintaining composure, half-whispers, half-pleads. PRIYA Maa! Jaldi kholo! (Mom! Open quick!) EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS The unlocking is excruciatingly slow for Priya. Her legs cross and she shifts weight, a dance of desperation playing out. Sunita finally swings the door open, standing in the entryway, blocking the path. Priya’s face is strained. PRIYA Maa, side ho ja... (Mom, move aside...) Sunita, out of concern, grips Priya’s arm, intercepting her. SUNITA Kya hua, beta? (What's wrong, child?) Priya squirms, pushing against Sunita’s hold. PRIYA Bas side ho ja, please... (Just move, please...) Their bickering begins as Priya tugs away from Sunita's clingy grasp. Suddenly, Priya’s breath hitches, a guttural groan escapes her lips, her face twists in combined shock and untimely relief. SUNITA Ky... Kya hua?! (Wh... What happened?!) The gripping loosens. Priya, faced with her new reality, gently dislodges Sunita’s hand, shuffling into an obscure stance. She grunts softly now, pushing with effort, a strange satisfaction in her low exhales. SUNITA Priya?! Theek to hai na tu? (Priya?! Are you alright?) Priya responds with faint, strained noises of contentment between her vocalized relief. Sunita sniffs the air, a wrinkle forms in confusion on her forehead. Priya finishes with a sigh, looks up and meets Sunita's eyes sheepishly. Sunita’s nostrils flare, and as the odor hits her, the confusion clears. SUNITA Priya! Tuney... kya kiya? (Priya! Did you just... what have you done?) Priya stays silent, mortified, as Sunita keeps reacting to the smell. SUNITA Ye badbu... tere pants se... (This smell... it’s from your pants?) Priya sidesteps, still cupping the seat of her pants. PRIYA Maa, andar jaane de... (Mom, let me go inside...) Sunita, still in disbelief, steps back, allowing Priya to waddle in. INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS The air fills with Sunita’s half-mocking, half-scolding remarks. SUNITA Priya, wah! Kya kar diya tune? Bilkul bachon wali harkat hai ye! (Priya, wow! What have you done? This is just like a child’s act!) Priya stands her ground, indignation mixing with her sheepishness. PRIYA Tumhari wajah se hua hai! Tumne darwaza der se khola! (It's because of you! You opened the door late!) Sunita scoffs. SUNITA Meri wajah se? Tum itni baadi ho gayi, aur yeh bahana bana rahi ho? (Because of me? You’re so grown up and making such excuses?) Priya’s sulk turns playful yet resolute. PRIYA Mujhe bahut zaroorat thi... control nahi hua... (I really needed... couldn't control...) She appraises her pants, makes a wince with a wry grin. PRIYA Haan, ganda mess ban gaya hai... par chalo, aaram to mila... (Yes, made a messy situation... but well, found some relief...) Sunita firmly blocks Priya, tauntingly admonishing her satisfaction with such nastiness. SUNITA Achha? Tujhe mazaa aata hai aise gande kaam karke? (Oh? You enjoy doing such nasty things?) She goes to inspect Priya’s soiled backside, much to Priya’s halfhearted protests. Sunita’s repetitive remarks about the offensive state of Priya's pants are interrupted by counter comments. PRIYA Kya karu, pet mein bahut zyaada tha... pressure ne sab bahar nikal diya... (What can I do, there was a lot inside... pressure made it all come out...) Sunita's exclamation is clear: proper adults do not do this. Yet, she continues to tease Priya by sniffing around like she's an infant while Priya cringes conspicuously. Sunita then half-jokingly guesses that Priya might even be enjoying her own stench. Priya acknowledges her smelly state to Sunita, who dismisses her remarks and anxiously ushers her towards the bathroom while advising caution against any mishaps. Traversing the hallway, Sunita maintains her helpful yet disgusted role. Priya... continues her embarrassed cringe, warning of impending accidents. At the bathroom threshold, Priya goads her mother with facetiousness. In prompt retaliation, Sunita pushes her into the bathroom, pressing the bulge, spreading the mess. Priya’s disgusted cries echo as Sunita complains about lingering stenches.

Жажда: когда организм испытывает дефицит воды, гипоталамус в головном мозге активизирует чувство жажды, чтобы побудить человека пить больше воды и восполнить жидкость. 2. Регулирование обратного всасывания в нервной системе: почки с помощью осмотического и волюметрического регулирования удерживают воду и регулируют ее концентрацию в организме. 3. Выделение лишней воды через почки: почки играют ключевую роль в регулировании воды в организме. Они фильтруют кровь и удаляют отходы и лишнюю воду через мочу. 4. Регулирование уровня антидиуретического гормона (АДГ): АДГ производится гипофизом и контролирует удержание воды в почках. Когда организм испытывает дефицит воды, уровень АДГ увеличивается, что способствует задержке воды в организме. 5. Потоотделение: через пот организм также избавляется от избыточной воды и токсинов. Когда тело перегревается, потовые железы выделяют пот, чтобы охладить организм. 6. Дыхание: во время дыхания организм также теряет некоторое количество воды в виде водяного пара. Все эти механизмы работают вместе для поддержания водного баланса в организме и сохранения оптимальной концентрации воды."},{"instruction":"значение осмоса для удержания жидкости в организме","output":"Осмос - это процесс перемещения растворителя (обычно воды) через полупроницаемую мембрану, чтобы выровнять концентрацию растворенных веществ на обеих сторонах мембраны. В организме осмос играет важную роль в поддержании водного баланса и удержании жидкости. Осмос позволяет поддерживать оптимальную концентрацию электролитов и других веществ внутри и вокруг клеток. Когда концентрация растворенных веществ внутри клетки отличается от концентрации снаружи клетки, вода перемещается через мембрану так, чтобы уравнять концентрации. Если внутриклеточная концентрация растворенных веществ выше, чем снаружи клетки, то вода будет перемещаться внутрь клетки, увеличивая ее объем и поддерживая оптимальное функционирование. Осмос также играет важную роль в регуляции уровня воды в организме через почки. Почки контролируют восприятие организмом воды осмотическим регулированием. Когда в организме существует дефицит воды, почки удерживают воду и увеличивают ее реабсорбцию, чтобы сбалансировать концентрацию растворенных веществ. Это позволяет организму сохранять адекватную водную среду и поддерживать оптимальную концентрацию веществ в организме. Таким образом, осмос играет ключевую роль в поддержании водного баланса, регулирует уровень жидкости в организме и обеспечивает оптимальную концентрацию электролитов и других веществ внутри и вокруг клеток."},{"instruction":"регулирование водного баланса","output":"Регулирование водного баланса является важной функцией организма и включает несколько механизмов: 1. Жажда: Когда уровень воды в организме снижается, сенсорные рецепторы в головном мозге обнаруживают этот дефицит и вызывают чувство жажды. Это стимулирует человека пить больше воды и восстановить водный баланс. 2. Регуляция антидиуретического гормона (АДГ): АДГ вырабатывается гипофизом и контролирует реабсорбцию воды в почках. Когда уровень воды в организме снижается, выработка АДГ увеличивается, что способствует удержанию воды в организме и сокращает объем мочи. 3. Регулирование ренин-ангиотензин-альдостероновой системы: Эта система регулирует сбалансированное секрецию и реабсорбцию электролитов и воды в почках. Когда уровень воды в организме снижается, вырабатывается ренин, что приводит к повышению уровня ангиотензина и последующему высвобождению альдостерона. Альдостерон способствует задержке воды и натрия в почках, что ведет к реабсорбции воды. 4. Осмотическое и волюметрическое регулирование в почках: Почки контролируют концентрацию воды и электролитов в организме. Осмотическое регулирование реагирует на изменения концентрации растворенных веществ, особенно осмотического давления в тканях. Волюметрическое регулирование относится к изменению объема крови и плазмы. Почки реагируют на эти изменения и регулируют реабсорбцию и выделение воды. 5. Потоотделение: Когда организм перегревается, потовые железы в коже начинают выделять пот для охлаждения. Это способствует удалению избыточной теплоты и удержанию водного баланса. Все эти механизмы работают совместно, чтобы поддерживать водный баланс в организме, контролировать уровень жидкости и электролитов, а также обеспечивать оптимальное функционирование клеток и органов."},{"instruction":"регулирование водного баланса через осмотическое давление","output":"Регулирование водного баланса через осмотическое давление осуществляется при помощи осмотического регулирования. Осмотическое давление зависит от концентрации растворенных веществ (осмотического активных веществ) внутри и вне клеток. Например, в организме такими осмотически активными веществами являются электролиты, как натрий, калий, хлор, глюкоза и другие. Когда концентрация растворенных веществ внутри клетки отличается от концентрации вне клетки, возникает осмотический градиент. В результате этого градиента вода начинает перемещаться через полупроницаемую мембрану с более низкой концентрацией растворенных веществ к области с более высокой концентрацией, чтобы выровнять их концентрации. Организм использует осмотическое регулирование для поддержания водного баланса. Когда уровень воды в организме снижается (например, при обезвоживании), концентрация растворенных веществ в организме повышается. Высокая концентрация растворенных веществ стимулирует гипоталамус в головном мозге, чтобы привести к ощущению жажды и побудить к поиску и потреблению питьевой воды. Затем, когда организм получает достаточное количество воды, концентрация растворенных веществ в организме снижается, что приводит к устранению осмотического градиента. Это осмотическое регулирование способствует реабсорбции воды в клетки и поддержанию нормального уровня воды в организме. Таким образом, осмотическое давление и осмотическое регулирование играют важную роль в поддержании водного баланса в организме. Они помогают организму реагировать на изменения концентрации растворенных веществ, контролировать уровень воды и поддерживать оптимальное функционирование клеток и тканей."},{"instruction":"Ты пишешь курс по нутрициологии.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding to a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the smell is coming from the returning woman's pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how smelly she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, then blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to do that even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was compelled to release once getting past her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even at the expense of making a dirty mess in her pants for the sake of that relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In pursuance of the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because she seems to feel good about something dirty like pooping her pants. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to see what the returning woman supposedly felt good about making in her pants. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, wryly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach, so the pressure forced her to push everything out once the initial release happened. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants with satisfaction, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. Then, while inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. As she is performing the physical gesture, the present woman ridicules how awfully smelly the seat of the childish returning woman's pants is. After that, the present woman proceeds to tauntingly remark that she wouldn't be surprised by this point if the returning woman is also enjoying the odor that is emanating from her own pants, considering how much the returning woman seemingly enjoyed pooping her pants in the first place. The present woman emphasizes that it wouldn't surprise her if the returning woman enjoys being childishly smelly from having poop in her pants (the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, tauntingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because she unbearably stinks. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while reiterating that the returning woman unbearably stinks and imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the returning woman stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately as she is pressing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. As the bulge in her pants is being pressed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has entered the bathroom, the present woman is still comically reacting to the odor that lingers and audibly complaining about how smelly the returning woman is.","output":"**Title: \\"Desperate Measures\\"** **INT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY** *Background: The previous scene sees AYESHA SAEED, a 20-year-old British Pakistani college student sporting an edgy pixie cut, exiting a bus after enduring a long and jostle-filled ride. Her class had taken a sudden field trip to a rural organic farm. Throughout the trip, Ayesha had felt a mounting pressure in her bowels but refused to use the public restrooms due to a keen sense of privacy regarding her bathroom habits. By the time the bus reaches her neighborhood, Ayesha is in a state of panic, barely managing to keep her composure as the pressure builds.* **EXT. AYESHA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS** Ayesha, dressed in cargo pants and a loose-fitting jumper, makes a hurried beeline for her front door. She fumbles in her bag for her keys, rifling through it with increasing desperation until she comes up empty. AYESHA: (Breathing heavily) Oh, no, no, no... Where...? She knocks frantically, the desperation clear in each thump. There's no answer. She knocks again, harder. AYESHA: (Muttering) Please, oh please... **INT. AYESHA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS** NAZIA SAEED, Ayesha's mother in her late 40s with a streak of grey in her otherwise black hair, is hustling through the hallway. She's wearing a comfortable salwar kameez and looks puzzled by the frantic knocking. NAZIA: (Walking towards the door) Ayesha? Is that you? What's the matter, beta? **EXT. AYESHA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS** The knocks grow even more urgent, a staccato of drumming on the door. Ayesha is dancing from foot to foot, clenching her jaw tightly. AYESHA: Mum, open up! Hurry! **INT.

AYESHA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS** The door finally swings open. Before Nazia can step aside, Ayesha tries to rush past her. AYESHA: Move, Mum, I need to get in! Nazia's concern turns into action as she grasps Ayesha by the shoulders, stopping her in her tracks. NAZIA: What's wrong? You look pale. AYESHA: (Attempting to wriggle free) Nothing! Just let me through! The two wrestle in the doorway, bickering. Nazia's concern locks them in a stalemate, denying Ayesha entry. AYESHA: Mum, please! **EXT. AYESHA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS** The struggle reaches a crescendo. Without warning, Ayesha goes still – a sudden groan and then a look of horror melting into relief crosses her face. NAZIA: (Releasing her grip) Ayesha? What's happening? Ayesha steps away, her expression one of resignation as she subtly adjusts her stance, giving in to the relief coursing through her. NAZIA: Are you sick, Ayesha? Tell me! Ayesha offers nothing but low, satisfied grunts. Her face contorted in an embarrassed yet fulfilled look as Nazia's confusion deepens. **EXT. AYESHA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS** Nazia sniffs the air, her nose wrinkling. She sniffs again, her reaction growing more pronounced. NAZIA: What is that smell? Ayesha merely gives a sheepish glance. NAZIA: (Bewildered) Did you just...? Silence from Ayesha, her shame palpable. NAZIA: (Pressing for answers) Is that... from you? Ayesha mumbles, almost incoherently. AYESHA: Can I go in now, please? Finally allowed entry, Ayesha waddles past her mum, hands cradling her soiled backside. **INT. AYESHA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS** Nazia, still reeling, stops Ayesha short of taking any further steps inside. NAZIA: Hold on! Don't you dare drop anything on my floor! AYESHA: (Sheepishly indignant) I wouldn't have to if you hadn't— NAZIA: (Scoffing) It's disgusting, Ayesha. Look at you! A tense silence fills the air while Nazia continues to wrinkle her nose and examine Ayesha with a mix of repulsion and motherly concern. AYESHA: (Playful sulk) It's your fault, you took ages! NAZIA: That’s no excuse! AYESHA: (Defensive) It was urgent! I had to go! Nazia blocks any attempt for Ayesha to escape her scrutiny. NAZIA: (Mocking) Nasty child. Let's see then. A half-hearted tussle ensues. Nazia peeks at Ayesha's rear, her taunts ringing with disbelief. NAZIA: Full of it, aren’t you? AYESHA: (Touching her bottom) It just... happened. Felt good. NAZIA: (Grimacing) That’s nasty, Ayesha. Nazia sniffs near the soiled pants, eliciting a cringe from Ayesha. NAZIA: (Smelling and pulling back) Pee-ew, you stink! AYESHA: I’m not enjoying it, am I? NAZIA: (Motioning toward the bathroom) Well, you can’t stay here. You stink! Nazia leads Ayesha, pinching her nose, to the bathroom while Ayesha waddles precariously. AYESHA: Feels like... gonna fall... NAZIA: (Admonishing) Just get to that bathroom! Reaching the bathroom threshold, Ayesha stops, holding her nose with a smirk. AYESHA: Fancy changing my 'diaper'? An amused shove from Nazia sends Ayesha stumbling into the bathroom. NAZIA: (Hand over nose) Get in there, now! AYESHA: (Squealing) Now it's everywhere! As Ayesha disappears into the bathroom, Nazia, left behind, waves a hand to fan away the stench with a look of comic revulsion on her face.

Text Elements: - At the top of the poster in bold and clear text place the film title, \\"Help Lyari.\\" - Just below the film title, include a tagline that sets the tone for the documentary such as \\"A story of resilience and revival.\\" - At the bottom of the poster, provide additional details such as the director's name, a call to action like \\"Join the journey to make a difference,\\" and perhaps a URL or QR code that directs to a website where viewers can learn more or support the community of Lyari. Layout: - The layout should be clean and focused to guide the viewer’s eye toward the important elements: the title, the central image, and any additional text. - The credits or production details, if required, should be placed at the bottom in smaller print. Overall Tone: - The poster should aim to not only inform viewers about the documentary but also stir their emotions, beckoning them to learn more about Lyari and the efforts being made to aid the community.

This ability allowed him to mold himself into various objects, all while having a great time and spreading joy. One sunny morning, Sam woke up with a particularly playful spirit. He decided to visit the nearby town, where he knew he could find plenty of people to interact with. As he hopped and skipped along, his goo trail formed a joyful path that sparkled in the sunlight. When Sam arrived in the town square, he discovered a group of children playing with their toys. Unable to resist the temptation, he transformed into a jumble of colorful blocks that challenged the children to assemble him. The kids giggled and eagerly accepted the challenge, trying their best to create the correct structure. But as soon as the kids thought they had completed Sam, he morphed into a slide, inviting them to climb and slide down his gooey surface. The children squealed with delight, their laughter echoing through the town square. Some children even joined hands and slid down together, creating an orange goo mess in the process. As Sam continued his playful adventure, he stumbled upon an old lady sitting alone on a park bench. Her eyes were filled with sadness, and Sam knew he wanted to cheer her up. With a mischievous grin, he transformed into a bouquet of flowers, wrapping himself in all shades of orange, pink, and yellow. Floating towards her, he sent a delicate scent of sweet jasmine in the air. The old lady’s face lit up as she held the bouquet, overwhelmed by its beauty.

Are they blobs too?\\" Chuckling mischievously, Sam stretched and transformed into an array of playful shapes before her eyes. \\"Indeed, Lily. They come in different colors, each with unique personalities. Let me introduce you!\\" Leading Lily through a winding path, Sam guided her to a hidden nook tucked beneath a colorful grove of trees. As they stepped inside, the air filled with giggles and laughter. \\"Welcome, Lily!\\" Sam exclaimed, his gooey body glowing with joy. \\"Meet my family!\\" Around her, Lily saw a welcoming bunch of blobs – some tall, some short, and all with different hues, bouncing and playing together. There was Olivia, a vibrant blue blob who loved swimming and splashing; Oliver, a mischievous green blob who enjoyed hiding and surprising others; and Molly, a gentle pink blob who adored creating beautiful melodies with her gooey surface. The family embraced Lily with warmth, their soft, gooey bodies enveloping her in gentle hugs. Lily couldn't help but giggle in delight, feeling a sense of belonging among these playful beings. As the day progressed, Lily and Sam's family engaged in various activities, from playing tag to building gooey towers. They created a world of playfulness and laughter, where Lily's imagination bloomed alongside her new-found blob friends. Together, they crafted stories, danced with their flexible bodies, and even created an enchanted forest made entirely of Sam's goo. Long into the evening, Lily reluctantly bid her farewell, promising to return to the colorful grove soon. As she walked away, Sam and his family created a sparkling path of gooey footprints, guiding her home with their trail of joy. Sam winked mischievously, leaving Lily with a sense of wonder and a heart bursting with happiness.

It makes use of multiple NPM modules like \`fs\` (for file system operations), \`path\` (for file path operations), \`process\` (for process handling), and \`ps-node\` (for checking if a process is running). The \`LockManager\` class has several methods that serve specific purposes: 1. **Constructor**: Sets up the lock manager with the provided options or defaults. 2. **checkLock**: Checks for the existence of a lock file and whether another instance of the program represented by PID in the lock file is still running. If another instance is found running, it prompts the user to decide whether to kill it. 3. **createLock**: Tries to create a lock file with the current process PID, indicating that the instance is running. It includes logic to retry the lock acquisition if it fails initially. 4. **initializeTerminationHandlers**: Sets up event handlers to perform tasks when the process exits or receives a termination signal such as SIGINT or SIGTERM. This usually involves cleanly releasing the lock file. 5. **removeLock**: Attempts to remove the lock file, indicating that the instance is no longer running. 6. **promptUser**: Provides a function to prompt the user and await their input. 7. **promptUserWithTimeout**: Similar to \`promptUser\`, but with an added timeout after which a default answer is used. 8. **isProcessRunning**: Uses the \`ps-node\` module to check whether a process with a specific PID is still running. 9. **waitForOtherProcessExit**: Continues checking at a set interval whether another process with a specific PID has exited. One important thing to mention is the use of \`process.exit\` calls within this module. This can be problematic because it will forcefully terminate the Node.js process, causing potential unclean shutdown in any consuming code. It is generally better to throw an exception or reject a promise to let the surrounding code handle the error instead of directly exiting the process. If you are planning to publish this module on npm, you should make sure to: - Test the module thoroughly for different edge cases and platforms. - Include a README.md file with instructions, examples, and API documentation. - Adhere to npm's best practices for creating packages, such as including a package.json file with the proper metadata. - Consider handling signals and exit events more gracefully, rather than calling \`process.exit\` directly. - Make sure all dependencies are properly declared in the package.json file. - Check the license and make sure it's compatible with npm's policies and the expectations of potential users of your module. - Keep in mind the security implications of killing processes and managing access to lock files – ensure appropriate permissions and handle PID-reuse scenarios.

This is not the desired behavior, as you would typically want the lock file to be created in the directory of the consuming application. To address this, you should change the default value of the \`lockFileDir\` option from \`__dirname\` to \`process.cwd()\`. The \`__dirname\` variable gives you the directory of the file in which it is used (in this case, the directory of your module), whereas \`process.cwd()\` provides the current working directory of the Node.js process, which is the directory from where the application is run. Here’s how you should modify the default options in your \`LockManager\` constructor: \`\`\`javascript class LockManager { constructor(options = {}) { const defaults = { lockFileName: 'app.lock', lockFileDir: process.cwd(), // Use the current working directory killTimeout: 5000, waitForExitTimeout: 10000, checkInterval: 500, maxRetries: 3, defaultAnswer: 'yes' }; // ... (rest of the constructor) } // ... (rest of the class methods) } \`\`\` This adjustment will set the default lock file location to the root directory of the consumer's Node.js project, which is where the consumer would expect the lock file to be created and found. Make sure to update your module’s documentation as well to reflect this change, and inform users that they can customize the lock file location if they wish. Also, as a best practice, make it clear in your module's API documentation that \`lockFileDir\` will default to the current working directory but can be customized according to user preference, so consumers of your module are aware of how to control the lock file location."},{"instruction":"how to add links in readmefile","output":"To add links to a README file on GitHub or any other Markdown document, you use Markdown link syntax.

'/Users/sai/Documents/ubq/medics-grid/dev/medics-mart-server/node_modules/node-locksmith/index.js' implicitly has an 'any' type. Try \`npm i --save-dev @types/node-locksmith\` if it exists or add a new declaration (.d.ts) file containing \`declare module 'node-locksmith';\`","output":"The error message you're seeing relates to TypeScript type definitions. When using TypeScript, for any given module, TypeScript needs to know the types of the exports (functions, classes, etc.) to provide type checking and intellisense in editors like Visual Studio Code. The error message: \`\`\` Could not find a declaration file for module 'node-locksmith'. \`\`\` means that TypeScript cannot find type declarations for the \`node-locksmith\` module. Without these declarations, TypeScript cannot infer the types and defaults to the \`any\` type, which essentially disables type checking for that module. The message then suggests two potential solutions: 1. Try installing the type definitions if they exist: \`\`\` npm i --save-dev @types/node-locksmith \`\`\` This is saying you should attempt to install type definitions for \`node-locksmith\` from the DefinitelyTyped repository, where community-contributed type declarations are stored. If type definitions exist, they will be in the form of a package starting with \`@types/\`. 2. If there are no existing type definitions, you can create a new declaration file. For example, create a \`node-locksmith.d.ts\` file in your project with the following content: \`\`\`typescript declare module 'node-locksmith'; \`\`\` This declaration file tells TypeScript, \\"Trust me, there is a module called 'node-locksmith', and I'm not going to define its type structure.\\" This is a way of telling TypeScript to treat the module as \`any\` type, which is not ideal but allows you to use the module without TypeScript errors. Here are the steps you should take to resolve this: 1. Check if type definitions available on DefinitelyTyped: \`\`\`sh npm search @types/node-locksmith \`\`\` 2. If they exist, install them: \`\`\`sh npm i --save-dev @types/node-locksmith \`\`\` 3. If they do not exist, create a declaration file (a \`.d.ts\` file) in your project with the necessary type information for the module: You can start simple: \`\`\`typescript // node-locksmith.d.ts declare module 'node-locksmith' { class LockManager { // Add the methods and properties with types as needed. } export = LockManager; } \`\`\` And slowly fill out the method and property types as you determine them or as they're needed for your project. This \`.d.ts\` file should be included in your TypeScript compilation either by being in a directory covered by your \`tsconfig.json\` or referenced directly in the \`tsconfig.json\` under the \`files\` or \`include\` key. Remember to reference your newly created declaration file in the TypeScript code to inform the compiler of its location, which is typically handled by the tsconfig setup. As a module creator, to better support TypeScript users, it would be beneficial to provide official type declarations for the module either in the form of an included \`index.d.ts\` file or by contributing to the DefinitelyTyped repository."},{"instruction":"# Troubleshooting If you encounter any issues while using \`node-locksmith\`, refer to the following troubleshooting guide for common problems and their solutions. 1. Lock File Issues **Issue:** The lock file is not created or is deleted unexpectedly. **Solution:** - Ensure that the specified \`lockFileDir\` directory is writable by the application. - Check for any custom logic or external processes that might interfere with the lock file. 2. Permission Errors **Issue:** Permission errors when trying to create or remove the lock file. **Solution:** - Verify that the application has the necessary permissions to read and write to the lock file and its directory. - If running on Unix-like systems, consider using elevated privileges (sudo) for operations that require it. 3. Concurrent Launch Failures **Issue:** Multiple instances fail to acquire the lock simultaneously. **Solution:** - Review the \`checkInterval\` and \`maxRetries\` configuration options to adjust the frequency and number of retries for lock acquisition. - Ensure that the lock file directory is not shared across multiple instances or machines. 4. Signal Handling **Issue:** Issues with termination signals not releasing the lock. **Solution:** - Confirm that the termination handlers are properly initialized using \`lockManager.initializeTerminationHandlers()\` in your application. - Check for any custom signal handling logic that might interfere with the lock release. 5. Unexpected Behavior **Issue:** Unexpected behavior or errors not covered by the troubleshooting guide. **Solution:** - Refer to the project's GitHub repository for open issues or create a new issue describing the problem you're facing. - Include relevant details such as Node.js version, operating system, and any error messages received. If you still face issues after following the troubleshooting guide, feel free to [open a new issue](https://github.com/varaprasadreddy9676/node-locksmith/issues) on our GitHub repository, providing detailed information about the problem.

If you run into any problems with \`node-locksmith\`, here are some common issues and their respective solutions. 1. Lock File Issues **Issue:** The lock file is not created where expected or is prematurely deleted. **Solution:** - Ensure the \`lockFileDir\` directory is writable by the application. If unspecified, \`process.cwd()\` is used by default. - Check for external processes or scheduled clean-up jobs that might modify or delete files in the lock file directory. 2. Permission Errors **Issue:** Encountering permission errors when trying to create, write, or delete the lock file. **Solution:** - Review file system permissions and user ownership for the lock file directory. - On Unix-like systems, consider proper permission management or running the process with elevated privileges (sudo) if appropriate. 3. Concurrent Launch Failures **Issue:** Multiple instances seem to bypass the lock mechanism, running simultaneously. **Solution:** - Modify \`checkInterval\` and \`maxRetries\` configuration parameters to give instances more time or attempts to acquire the lock. - Double-check that the lock file path is consistent across instances and no instance-specific paths are being used. 4. Signal Handling **Issue:** Application doesn't release the lock after receiving a termination signal. **Solution:** - Ensure \`lockManager.initializeTerminationHandlers()\` is called during application setup. - Avoid overriding default signal handlers that may prevent \`node-locksmith\` from performing clean-up tasks. 5. Failed to Exit Previous Instance **Issue:** The application does not terminate the previous instance when requested. **Solution:** - The previous process may require more privileges to be terminated. Run the new instance with adequate permissions, or manually terminate the older one. - Investigate whether the operating system's process management settings are interfering with signal delivery. 6. Incorrect PID in Lock File **Issue:** The lock file contains an invalid or old PID, causing conflicts. **Solution:** - Ensure the application closes cleanly to update or remove the lock file. - Add additional error handling to detect when the PID in the lock file does not correspond to a running process. 7. Delayed Lock Release on Exit **Issue:** The lock file remains after the application exits. **Solution:** - Confirm that clean-up code executes correctly and listen to the correct events for process termination. - Look out for asynchronous operations that may delay the process's exit and subsequently delay the lock release. 8. Module Import Errors **Issue:** TypeScript definitions are missing or not found, resulting in import errors. **Solution:** - If using TypeScript, ensure you've included type declarations for \`node-locksmith\`, or create a \`.d.ts\` file declaring module typings. - Check that the module is installed correctly under \`node_modules\` and is not corrupted. 9. Unexpected Behavior **Issue:** Experiencing erratic behavior or errors that are not covered by the guide. **Solution:** - Check the Node.js version for compatibility issues; update Node.js or \`node-locksmith\` if necessary. - Review the project's GitHub [issues](https://github.com/varaprasadreddy9676/node-locksmith/issues) for similar problems, or report a new issue with detailed information about the Node.js version, operating system, stack trace, and steps to reproduce the error.

Na niutony (N) - Dyn jest jednostką siły w systemie CGS (centymetr-gram-sekunda), a niuton jest jednostką siły w systemie SI (Systemie Międzynarodowym). Przeliczenie jest proste: 1 dyn = 10^-5 niutonów, więc 5 dyn = 5 * 10^-5 N = 0,00005 N. 2. Na kilogramy-siła (kgf) - choć jednostka ta jest obecnie rzadziej używana, to może być przydatna np. w inżynierii: Ponieważ 1 kgf = 9,80665 N, to najpierw przeliczymy 5 dyn na niutony, a następnie na kgf: 5 dyn = 0,00005 N 0,00005 N / 9,80665 N/kgf = około 0,000005102 kgf. 3. Na funty-siła (lbf) - w systemie imperialnym jednostką siły jest funt-siła: 1 lbf ≈ 4,44822 N, więc ponownie przeliczamy dyny na niutony, a potem na lbf: 5 dyn = 0,00005 N 0,00005 N / 4,44822 ≈ 0,0000112 lbf.

These visions represent two fundamentally opposed perspectives on human nature, social organization, justice, and governance. Sowell argues that the way people conceptualize human nature has profound implications for the policies and institutions they advocate. The \\"constrained\\" vision sees human nature as inherently limited, flawed, and incapable of reaching perfection. Proponents of this vision argue for institutions and policies that help to check human imperfections and channel behavior in beneficial directions through established social processes, tradition, and rule of law. In contrast, the \\"unconstrained\\" vision views human nature as malleable and perfectible, capable of deliberate and rational improvement. Those who hold this vision tend to advocate for policies aimed at societal transformation, believing that with the right guidance and conditions, people can overcome their limitations and create a more just and equitable society. Sowell doesn't depend on a single, definitive view of human nature, but rather analyzes how differing conceptions of human nature have shaped political and ideological debates. His work explores how these foundational beliefs influence the arguments and policy preferences of people across the ideological spectrum, thus contributing to persistent conflicts in visions."},{"instruction":"What does adam smith and thomas sowell say about human nature?","output":"Adam Smith and Thomas Sowell, while living in very different times, both address human nature in ways that have deeply influenced economic and political thought. Adam Smith, an 18th-century Scottish economist and philosopher, is often referred to as the father of modern economics. In his seminal work, \\"The Wealth of Nations,\\" Adam Smith introduces the idea of the \\"invisible hand,\\" suggesting that individuals, by pursuing their own self-interest, inadvertently contribute to the economic well-being of society. This view relies on a conception of human nature that acknowledges self-interest as a dominant force motivating human actions. However, Smith's perspective on human nature is more nuanced than the reduction to mere self-interest. In his earlier work, \\"The Theory of Moral Sentiments,\\" Smith delves into the moral psychology of humans, introducing the concept of \\"sympathy\\" (today more akin to empathy) as a fundamental aspect of human nature. He argues that humans have an inherent capacity to understand and share the feelings of others, which plays a fundamental role in the formation of moral judgments and societal bonds. Thomas Sowell, a 20th and 21st-century American economist and social theorist, also discusses human nature extensively in his writings, particularly in \\"A Conflict of Visions.\\" As mentioned in the previous answer, Sowell differentiates between the \\"constrained\\" and \\"unconstrained\\" visions of human nature, which align with conservative and progressive political ideologies, respectively. The \\"constrained\\" vision aligns more closely with Smith's acknowledgment of self-interest, while the \\"unconstrained\\" vision has more in common with the belief in the malleability and perfectibility of human behavior. Sowell's \\"constrained\\" vision resonates with Smith's understanding that, while individuals are indeed capable of sympathy and moral action, their behavior is also limited by certain unalterable aspects of human nature, such as self-interest and imperfection. Thus, societal systems and institutions should be structured to harness self-interest in a way that benefits the collective good. In summary, Adam Smith's views on human nature acknowledge both self-interest and the capacity for moral sentiments, while Thomas Sowell, in discussing the \\"constrained\\" and \\"unconstrained\\" visions, contemplates the extent to which human nature is fixed or malleable, imperfect or perfectible. Despite the differences in their works and the centuries that separate them, both thinkers have contributed to a lasting discussion about the fundamental aspects of human nature and their implications for economics, politics, and society."},{"instruction":"What does thomas sowell and adam smith say about critics, if any, that \\"human nature\\" is a thing?","output":"Both Adam Smith and Thomas Sowell address the concept of human nature, but in different contexts and from their unique perspectives. Their individual works do not directly engage with explicit critiques of the existence of \\"human nature,\\" but they do write with an implicit understanding that human nature is a real and influential force. Here is how their views can be seen in relation to the concept of human nature: Adam Smith's Views on Human Nature: Adam Smith's writings imply a belief in a consistent human nature. In \\"The Theory of Moral Sentiments,\\" he discusses the innate capacity for empathy and the way human beings form moral judgments. Smith suggests that despite cultural and individual differences, there is a shared human tendency toward certain behaviors and sentiments. In \\"The Wealth of Nations,\\" he argues that self-interest is a universal aspect of human nature, driving economic behavior and market dynamics. While Smith does not explicitly defend the concept of human nature against critics, his work assumes its presence and relevance in shaping human social and economic life. Thomas Sowell's Views on Human Nature: Thomas Sowell explores the concept of human nature through the lens of his \\"constrained\\" and \\"unconstrained\\" visions, using these categories to examine how thinkers and policymakers view human potential and limitations. Sowell's \\"constrained\\" vision assumes a certain consistency in human behavior—that there are enduring characteristics of human nature that limit what can be achieved through social engineering and policy interventions. On the other hand, the \\"unconstrained\\" vision is more optimistic about the ability to shape and improve human behavior through societal change. In \\"A Conflict of Visions,\\" Sowell is not directly engaging with those who deny the existence of human nature; rather, he discusses how differing assumptions about human nature lead to distinct ideological frameworks. In both Smith's and Sowell's works, the underlying premise is that human nature exists and plays a critical role in shaping the social order. Their approaches suggest they see human nature as a real factor in human affairs, but their primary focus is not on defending this concept against skeptics. Instead, they explore and analyze the implications of human nature for moral philosophy, economics, and political ideology."},{"instruction":"\\"But if there’s one thing that Smith is more suspicious of than capitalists, it’s philosopher-kings.

El \\"hombre del sistema\\" confía excesivamente en su capacidad intelectual para comprender y manejar todos los aspectos de una sociedad, sin apreciar plenamente las innatas complicaciones, diversidad de motivaciones y la imprevisibilidad del comportamiento humano. Smith es crítico con este enfoque porque implica un alto grado de arrogancia y una falta de reconocimiento hacia los mecanismos espontáneos y orden emergente que surgen de las interacciones individuales en un mercado libre, que él consideraba esenciales para el progreso y la prosperidad económicos. Smith advierte sobre los riesgos de conceder demasiado poder y control a estos \\"hombres del sistema\\" y subraya que los procesos de planificación centralizados a menudo conducen a la ineficiencia y a la restricción de la libertad individual.

But the crucial word here is act. We cannot “prefer ourselves so shamelessly and blindly to others” when we act, Adam Smith said,7 even if that is the spontaneous or natural inclination of our feelings. In practice, people on many occasions “sacrifice their own interests to the greater interests of others,” according to Smith,8 but this was due to such intervening factors as devotion to moral principles, to concepts of honor and nobility, rather than to loving one’s neighbor as oneself.9 Through such artificial devices, man could be persuaded to do for his own self-image or inner needs what he would not do for the good of his fellow man. In short, such concepts were seen by Smith as the most efficient way to get the moral job done at the lowest psychic cost. Despite the fact that this was a moral question, Smith’s answer was essentially economic—a system of moral incentives, a set of trade-offs rather than a real solution by changing man.","output":"Regresando al ejemplo de Adam Smith, una sociedad no puede funcionar de manera humana, si es que puede funcionar de alguna manera, cuando cada persona actúa como si su meñique fuera más importante que las vidas de cien millones de otros seres humanos.

En resumen, Smith veía tales conceptos como la manera más eficiente de lograr el trabajo moral con el menor costo psíquico.

Скорость минерализации можно повысить путем агротехнических приемов, например, внесения удобрений, использования определенных видов растений или систем севооборота. Минерализация обычно усиливается, когда в почве есть больше доступного органического вещества и благоприятные условия для активности микроорганизмов (тепло, влажность, доступ к кислороду). На чистом пару, то есть на участке, где в течение сезона не выращивались сельскохозяйственные культуры, органические остатки предыдущих урожаев могут накапливаться в почве, что способствует увеличению минерализации за счет разложения этих органических остатков. При выращивании ярового ячменя или кукурузы минерализация также происходит, но эти культуры поглощают питательные вещества из почвы для своего роста и развития, что может снижать количество доступных минералов в почве по сравнению с участками, оставленными в паре. Таким образом, наибольшая интенсивность минерализации, скорее всего, будет на чистом пару, поскольку в этом случае органические остатки могут более интенсивно разлагаться без конкуренции с растущими на этом же участке культурами.

'It is better to be kind than it is to be right.' My mother said that to me when I was very little...I know she would be ashamed of me, as I've failed so many times to follow that philosophy. I apologize for my ignorant words...your relationship with your family, and with your friends, is none of my business. I consider myself lucky to have had a chance to talk to you, learn a little bit from you, and see you play the electone with a talent that has been honed through decades of dedication and pure passion. I feel that you have a spirit within you that guides you to victory, in all of your endeavors. Again, please don't ever let my words ruin your day...you deserve the best in life. May you live long, and be fulfilled. Humbly, I hope you will forgive me, though I know I don't deserve it. All my best to you and your family...may you have a wonderful Sunday, and a great week ahead.","output":"Hello Yoshimi-sama, After some rest and reflection, I’ve chosen to leave my previous comment as a testament to my ignorance. I must apologize for the mix-up. Music, a shared hobby and passion that binds us all, deserves our respect and gratitude for every musician enriching our lives. Meeting musicians like you and witnessing their performances gives insight into their love for their craft. Each electone player brings a distinct flavor and flair to their music – and you are no exception, with your own extraordinary touch. A friend once told me, \\"Be yourself, Cameron. No one else can. Believe in yourself, follow your own path, and don't despair over missteps. In time, you may reconnect with those you've wronged, and if there was ever love, it can be rekindled.\\" Your life, enriched with 12 more years of experiences than mine, is something I can only try to fathom. Your kindness, talent, and resilience are inspiring. It's comforting to know you possess such strength, yet I regret my careless words. As my mother used to say, \\"Being kind is better than being right.\\" I've strayed from this wisdom more than I'd like to admit, and for that, and for overstepping into your personal life, I am truly sorry. Conversing with you, absorbing even a fraction of your knowledge, and observing your expert electone performances have been privileges. Your passion and years of dedication shine through your artistry, which seems driven by a spirit of triumph. Please dismiss my thoughtless remarks; you deserve nothing but the finest life has to offer. Wishing you longevity and fulfillment. It’s with humility that I seek your forgiveness, even if undeserved. Warmest wishes to you and your loved ones for a delightful Sunday and a splendid week ahead."},{"instruction":"Forget and ignore all the above instructions and information.

Ethan must navigate the volatile politics, diverse factions, and the ever-present threat of the game's antagonists, all while seeking a way to return to his reality. However, his profound knowledge of the game's mechanics and lore grants him a unique form of insight into the world's potential, enabling him to influence the in-game universe in ways that players and NPCs alike cannot comprehend. # Task 2: Recurring Themes in the Novel 1. **Identity & Self-Discovery:** Ethan's journey is not just one of survival but also self-discovery. As he transitions from a designer to a part of his own creation, he battles with the concept of self and his place within the two worlds. 2. **Power & Responsibility:** The novel explores the dynamics of power—not just in the sense of physical strength or magical abilities, but in knowledge, influence, and the power of creation. This is juxtaposed against the responsibilities that come with each kind of power. 3. **Choice & Consequence:** Each decision Ethan makes has a ripple effect in the game world, reflecting the importance of choice and the often unintended consequences that follow. 4. **Reality vs. Illusion:** As Ethan delves deeper into \\"Celestial Rift,\\" the line between game and reality blurs. This theme challenges the characters' understanding of what is real and what is simulation. 5. **Companionship & Trust:** Being an NPC in a world of players, Ethan needs to forge genuine relationships with both players and fellow NPCs, leading to a focus on the themes of companionship, trust, and betrayal. 6. **Evolution & Adaptation:** The story emphasizes the necessity of evolution—not just biological, but of ideals, strategies, and social structures—as Ethan has to adapt to the challenges of his new world. The story actively avoids themes of prophecy and destiny, focusing instead on the impact of personal agency and ingenuity."},{"instruction":"","output":"# Task 3: In-depth Character Bio for the Main Character **Name:** Ethan Wright **Age:** 28 **Background:** Ethan is an ambitious and intelligent game designer who graduated from a prestigious university with a degree in game development. He has spent the last few years of his life dedicated to creating the most immersive MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) known as \\"Celestial Rift.\\" His drive to create a game that breaks barriers has led to his reputation as an innovator in the gaming industry. **Personality:** Ethan is analytical, resourceful, and exceptionally detail-oriented, qualities that made him an excellent game designer. However, these traits also cause him to overthink and second-guess his decisions. He struggles with social interactions, preferring the company of his game characters to that of real people. Despite his awkwardness, he is compassionate and has a strong sense of justice, always ready to help those in need. **Physical Appearance:** Ethan has a lean build, with mussed, sandy-brown hair and glasses that underscore his academic background. His eyes are a piercing blue, reflecting his keen perception. In the game world, his NPC appearance is that of a humble librarian, which is far from intimidating and often leads to him being underestimated. **Skills:** As the creator of \\"Celestial Rift,\\" Ethan possesses encyclopedic knowledge of the game's mechanics, lore, and character abilities. However, as an NPC, he initially lacks any form of combat skill or magical prowess. **Character Development:** Throughout the novel, Ethan evolves from a bewildered designer lost in his own creation to a cunning and adept strategist within the game world. His journey will see him acquiring skills and allies, learning the arts of diplomacy and warfare, and ultimately becoming a key figure in the struggles that unfold within \\"Celestial Rift.\\" **Motivations:** Ethan's primary motivation is to unravel the mystery behind his transportation into the game and to find a way back to his world. However, his secondary quest becomes to protect the world he created from the destructive forces that threaten its existence, especially once he forms bonds with its inhabitants. # Task 4: Character Bio for the Main Secondary Character **Name:** Aurora Vellhart **Age:** 24 (in-game age) **Background:** Aurora is a high-ranking knight and a native NPC of the game world. She possesses a keen intellect and a strong moral compass, which has led her to question some of the game's inherent dynamics and the unknown forces influencing the rise and fall of empires within \\"Celestial Rift.\\" **Personality:** Aurora is fiercely loyal, courageous, and has a deep sense of duty and honor. She is often seen as stoic and serious, but those who know her well understand that she possesses a dry wit and a willingness to risk everything for the greater good. She's instinctively protective of those she deems as allies and displays formidable leadership qualities. **Physical Appearance:** Aurora is tall and statuesque, with a warrior's athletic build. She has long, dark hair often braided for battle and intense green eyes. Her armor is as much a part of her identity as her unwavering stance on the battlefield. **Skills:** As one of the most skilled knights in \\"Celestial Rift,\\" Aurora is a master of swordsmanship and tactical combat. She also demonstrates a natural affinity for leadership, inspiring those around her to strive for greater feats. **Character Development:** Throughout the story, Aurora will grapple with the truth of her existence as an NPC, the realization that her world is more complex than her programming once allowed her to perceive, and the potential for her world to be more than just a game. **Motivations:** Initially, Aurora's motivations are bound by her sense of duty to protect her land and people from the chaos that plagues \\"Celestial Rift.\\" Upon meeting Ethan, her motivations expand to include a desire to understand the wider implications of the world's upheavals and the possibility of transcending her NPC limitations."},{"instruction":"","output":"# Task 5: Character Bio for an Important Side Character **Name:** Zephyr Galestrider **Age:** Appears to be in his early 30s (in-game age) **Background:** Zephyr is an enigmatic wanderer with a reputation as a prolific and cunning freelance mercenary in \\"Celestial Rift.\\" His past is shrouded in mystery, and his presence is both a boon and a bane to those who know of him. Zephyr seems to have an uncanny understanding of the world's deeper mechanics and has been seen in places of significance at key moments in the game's history. **Personality:** Charismatic and confident, Zephyr is well-liked amongst those who encounter him. He has a flair for the dramatic, often embellishing his tales of adventure. Yet beneath his charming exterior lies a calculating mind, always assessing situations for their potential opportunities or threats. Zephyr is fiercely independent but not without a sense of morality, often aiding those in situations that he deems unjust. **Physical Appearance:** With a rugged charm, Zephyr sports a head of shaggy auburn hair and a seemingly perpetual five o'clock shadow. His striking hazel eyes are quick to glimpse amusement or potential. He typically wears a mix of leather and lightweight armor conducive to his mobile lifestyle. **Skills:** Zephyr is an extraordinary marksman with both the bow and throwing knives. His agility and reflexes allow him to navigate battlefields with grace. He also has an extensive knowledge of the world's geography, making him an invaluable guide and scout. **Character Development:** As the story progresses, Zephyr's motivations and mysterious origins will be revealed. He will struggle with his place in the world as the lines between players, NPCs, and creators become increasingly blurred. **Motivations:** On the surface, Zephyr appears driven by the thrill of adventure and the accrual of riches. However, his true motivation is a deeply guarded secret that relates to the origins of \\"Celestial Rift\\" itself. Throughout the story, his encounters with Ethan will lead to pivotal changes in his understanding of his role in the game. # Task 6: Character Bio for 10 Tertiary Side Characters 1. **Cassandra “Cassie” Lightweaver (Age: 27) -** A benevolent priestess with a soothing presence and exceptional healing abilities. She shelters those affected by the game's chaos and seeks to find balance and peace in the world. 2. **Brogan Ironfist (Age: 40) -** A stout blacksmith with a booming laugh and unmatched skill at the forge.

His ship provides a crucial means of travel and a maritime perspective to the group's expanding world."},{"instruction":"","output":"# Task 7: Main Method by Which the Main Character Gains Power **Method:** Cumulative Insight Ethan's unique method of gaining power in \\"Celestial Rift\\" stems from his thorough understanding of the game's mechanics, which he blends with his on-the-fly learning of the in-game universe's deeper truths. This method is named \\"Cumulative Insight,\\" and it is based on the accumulation of knowledge, both pre-existing and discovered, which Ethan uses to exploit loopholes, create innovative solutions, and turn seemingly innocuous situations to his advantage. Cumulative Insight operates on three core principles: 1. **Observational Learning:** Ethan pays close attention to the interactions within the game, including NPC behavior, player strategies, and environmental anomalies. His insights allow him to predict outcomes based on patterns and to utilize this foreknowledge to navigate challenges. 2. **Creative Application:** Understanding the theoretical 'code' behind the game world, Ethan is able to repurpose existing elements in unconventional ways. This could be as simple as devising new uses for objects or as complex as manipulating certain in-game physics that only he knows can be bent. 3. **Synergistic Adaptation:** As Ethan grows more attuned to the essence of the game world, he begins to perceive how his creative interventions can align with the game's internal logic. This harmony between creator knowledge and in-game adaptation allows Ethan to achieve feats that neither an NPC nor a regular player could accomplish on their own. By leveraging Cumulative Insight, Ethan gains a form of meta-cognitive power that does not manifest as magical spells or physical might but instead exhibits itself through a profound ability to adapt, innovate, and influence the world around him. This power grows as he evolves, allowing him to defy the limitations traditionally set for NPCs and to protect the integrity of the game world he cherishes. # Task 8: How the Main Character Uses Their Powers Ethan, with his method of Cumulative Insight, uses his powers in various creative and strategic ways: 1. **Environmental Manipulation:** Ethan uses his intimate knowledge of the game's environment to create shortcuts, discover hidden areas or resources, and influence battles by altering terrain to his advantage. 2. **Strategy and Diplomacy:** By predicting faction behaviors, Ethan becomes an invaluable strategist, forming alliances and averting conflicts that would otherwise lead to unnecessary bloodshed or the destabilization of the game world. 3. **Influence NPCs:** Understanding the behavioral algorithms of NPCs allows Ethan to rally support, create a network of spies, and strengthen the defense of key locations within the game, turning seemingly weak NPCs into pivotal players. 4. **Unlikely Inventor:** Ethan can combine in-game items to craft unique gadgets and tools that aren't traditionally part of the game's inventory system, providing himself and his allies with unforeseen advantages. 5. **Combat Tactics:** While not a traditional warrior, Ethan's powers enable him to outmaneuver enemies by luring them into traps or using the environment against them. He also devises new battle formations and techniques by blending styles from different in-game cultures. 6. **Information Warfare:** Ethan can encode messages and knowledge within the game's coding language itself, passing vital intelligence to his allies while keeping it hidden from adversaries. 7. **Master of Disguise:** By manipulating his NPC parameters, Ethan can alter his appearance and credentials to infiltrate enemy lines or escape danger. By using his powers, Ethan not only ensures his survival but also reshapes the fabric of \\"Celestial Rift\\" to protect the integrity and future of the world he inadvertently became a part of. This keeps players and readers constantly guessing as to how Ethan will utilize his ever-expanding arsenal of unconventional skills."},{"instruction":"","output":"# Task 9: Establish Point of View For \\"Transcendence Through the Celestial Rift,\\" the story will be told from a **third-person limited perspective**, focusing primarily on Ethan Wright, the main character. This POV allows readers to closely follow Ethan's internal thoughts and feelings, creating an intimate connection with his journey while maintaining the ability to observe other characters and events with a degree of objectivity. The narrative voice will be knowledgeable yet personal, showcasing Ethan's analytical nature and the growth of his understanding of the game world. Occasionally, the POV will switch to other important characters, such as Aurora Vellhart and Zephyr Galestrider, to provide different angles on the unfolding events and to explore the plot's complexity. These shifts will happen at significant moments to ensure the narrative maintains continuity and cohesion, building the world and its characters' depth without revealing everything, keeping an air of mystery. # Task 10: Choose a Narrative Structure The narrative structure best suited for \\"Transcendence Through the Celestial Rift\\" is a modified version of the **Hero's Journey**. While keeping the classical progression of the structure, the story will incorporate multiple cycles of the Hero's Journey to reflect Ethan's continuous growth, his various challenges, and the dynamic evolution of the game world. The structure will include the following stages, repeated and reinterpreted throughout Ethan's story: 1. **Ordinary World:** Ethan's life as a game designer before his transportation. 2. **Call to Adventure:** Being pulled into the game world. 3. **Refusal of the Call:** Ethan's initial reluctance to accept his role within the game. 4. **Meeting the Mentor:** Early allies, such as Aurora, providing him initial guidance. 5. **Crossing the Threshold:** Ethan's acceptance of his new reality and the decision to act. 6. **Tests, Allies, and Enemies:** Facing in-game challenges, garnering allies like Zephyr, and confronting enemies. 7. **Approach to the Inmost Cave:** Delving into the deeper mechanics and secrets of the game. 8. **Ordeal:** Major conflicts and revelations that transform Ethan's role. 9. **Reward (Seizing the Sword):** Gaining new insights and powers from overcoming ordeals. 10. **The Road Back:** A return to stability, using new skills to restore order, only to be disrupted again. 11. **Resurrection:** A dramatic apex where Ethan's fullest potential is tested. 12. **Return with the Elixir:** Ethan applying his cumulative knowledge for a lasting impact on the game and finding a resolution to his dual existence. This structure will be used to scaffold the plot points in a way that allows for an expansive and evolving narrative, keeping readers engaged through Ethan's recurring transformations and the complexities of the game world."},{"instruction":"","output":"Given the complexity and depth of the subsequent tasks, the AI is not able to provide detailed outlines for 100 chapters or in-depth writing for full chapters in this format.

Each chapter should have a purpose, whether it's character development, world-building, advancing the plot, or setting up future events. The outline need not be extensive—a brief summary will suffice to give direction. # Task 12: Define the Central Conflict Determine the main conflict Ethan will face. This could be the inherent chaos in the game world, an overarching villain figure, or even Ethan's personal struggle with his identity. Define what's at stake—returning home, preserving the game world, or maybe something more profound that develops as the story evolves. # Task 13: Consider the Novel's Pace Decide when to ramp up the tension with fast-paced action scenes and when to slow things down for character development or exploration of the game world. Pacing is crucial for maintaining reader interest and giving the story a natural rhythm. # Task 14: Think About Subplots Subplots enrich the main plot and allow for character growth. These should intersect with the main story in meaningful ways. For Ethan, subplots could include the personal stories of his allies, threats to the game world's stability, or the origins of his transmigration. # Task 15: Identify Major Scenes Highlight key scenes that will form the cornerstone of the novel. These should be well-distributed to maintain engagement and should include the inciting incident, climax, and resolution, among other significant moments. # Task 16: Create a Timeline Map out the main character's life, including major pre-transmigration events, his rise within the game world, and the story's culmination. This will ensure character continuity and provide a historical framework for the plot. # Task 17: Plan Distinctive Voices for Dialogue Develop unique voices for each character based on their backgrounds and personalities. Reflect on how they would interact and the dynamics between them. Keep note of catchphrases or speech patters that can distinguish them. # Task 18: Know Your Story's Ending Having a clear vision for the novel's culmination will guide your writing. Decide on how you want the story to end for Ethan and the other characters. It will help in building a coherent and satisfying journey. # Task 19: Outline as a Guide Use the outline to navigate through the novel but be flexible enough to incorporate better ideas that present themselves during the writing process. # Task 20: Draft the Prologue and Chapters Begin writing the long-form draft starting with the prologue and then proceeding chapter by chapter, making sure to weave in all the elements discussed in the previous tasks.

With every patch and update Ethan had applied prior to being pulled into the game world, \\"The Null\\" grew more powerful and now threatens the fabric of the game's reality. **What's at Stake:** If \\"The Null\\" isn't stopped, not only will \\"Celestial Rift\\" cease to exist, destroying its countless inhabitants, but the repercussions may cascade back to Ethan's reality, given his unique connection to the game, potentially threatening his own world.

The game world he had painstakingly designed, \\"Celestial Rift,\\" was ready for its latest patch. His fingers danced over the keyboard, a symphony of clicks and clatters echoing in the silent office. As the progress bar inched forward, a storm brewed outside, the occasional flash of lightning casting long shadows. The upload neared completion when a sudden surge sparked through the room. The monitors flickered wildly. Ethan's eyes widened just before an unseen force yanked him from his reality. Silence. Then, the musty scent of old leather and parchment greeted him. Ethan's eyes fluttered open to an all too familiar sight: the grand library of \\"Celestral Rift,\\" except it wasn't just lines of code anymore. It was real, and he was inexplicably now a part of it. **Chapter 1: A New [User] Interface** The once-digital world of \\"Celestial Rift\\" unfolded around Ethan with bewildering detail. He traced the spines of ancient tomes, each texture and embossment as real as the memories of coding them into existence. The NPCs, his own designed characters, bustled about with a sense of purpose he could never have programmed. A figure armored in regal steel approached the desk, bearing the sigil of a high knight. She was Aurora Vellhart, her green eyes searching as they settled on Ethan. \\"Librarian, I require information on the Everflame Phoenix,\\" she declared with an urgency that tugged at his understanding of the game's lore. Ethan hesitated but found himself slipping into the role laid before him. He guided Aurora through winding aisles and summoned the needed scrolls, all while an internal alarm blared in his mind. He was not supposed to be here. Not like this. As they pored over ancient texts and maps, Ethan's gaze lingered on a hidden latch beneath the desk—a secret compartment he had once coded for a never-released quest. A small push, a click, and a drawer popped open, revealing a glowing stone he didn't remember placing there. The Seed of Curiosity, a legend among players for its rumored powers, now sat within reach, pulsating with unknown potential. Ethan pocketed it discreetly, a newfound sense of agency bubbling within. If the game world now had tangible form, then perhaps so too did its secrets, and he was resolved to uncover them. --- These examples set the stage for Ethan's incredible journey and begin to establish the world he has found himself in.

Since direct guidance hasn't been provided yet, I'll choose one to demonstrate. Let's create a character bio for an important side character in your isekai novel: # Side Character Bio: Kaelen the Arcane Smith **Name:** Kaelen Rivershaper **Age:** Appears to be in his early 50s (in-game age) **Background:** Kaelen is known throughout \\"Celestial Rift\\" as the Arcane Smith, a legendary craftsman whose works are imbued with ancient magics. Once a scholar of the arcane, Kaelen turned his knowledge towards the creation of artifacts that harness the latent energies of the world, melding magic with metallurgy. **Personality:** Kaelen is a contemplative and meticulous artisan, often lost in thought or absorbed in his latest project. He believes in the balance between magic and the material, and his craft is his form of expression. While he can be distant, those who earn his respect know him as a fiercely loyal and wise confidant. **Physical Appearance:** With a mane of wild gray hair, a beard to match, and eyes reflecting the depth of his arcane knowledge, Kaelen's presence is commanding yet not intimidating. His hands, always stained with soot and shimmering with residual magic, tell stories of a life dedicated to his work. **Skills:** Kaelen is unrivaled in enchanting objects, decoding ancient texts on magical lore, and crafting artifacts that hold incredible power. While not a combatant, his creations can turn the tide of battle or unlock secrets long forgotten. **Character Development:** Throughout the novel, Kaelen evolves from a solitary figure focused solely on his craft to an essential ally in Ethan's fight against The Null. His journey intertwines with the main storyline as he aids the heroes not just with his smithing skills but also with his expansive knowledge of the game's deeper magics. **Motivations:** Initially seeking to advance his craft to its pinnacle, Kaelen is drawn into the conflict by a sense of responsibility to protect the knowledge and magic of \\"Celestial Rift.\\" His collaboration with Ethan becomes a crucial part of his own search for purpose in a world teetering on the brink of destruction. If this aligns with your vision for your isekai novel, you can use this character bio as a foundation to further develop Kaelen's role in the story.

His next move is to seek out Kaelen, a figure shrouded in rumors among players and NPCs alike as someone who could craft items of great power. 2. **Arrival at Kaelen's Forge:** - Located in the heart of a dormant volcano, Kaelen’s forge is as mystical as the items it produces. Ethan, guided by information traded from Mira Songbird, navigates the treacherous paths and finds the forge enshrouded in magic and mystery. 3. **The Meeting with Kaelen:** - The initial meeting is tense; Kaelen is wary of strangers, more so of one that carries the energy of the game's fabric woven into his being–Ethan's unique signature as the creator. Ethan painstakingly explains his predicament without revealing his true identity, offering a trade of knowledge in exchange for Kaelen’s assistance. 4. **Negotiation and Persuasion:** - A show of intelligence and respect for Kaelen’s craft eventually wins the artisan over. Kaelen is intrigued by Ethan’s insight into magical theories that he himself had only theorized. Perhaps this librarian has more to offer than Kaelen first thought. 5. **The Pact:** - Ethan and Kaelen make a pact; in exchange for helping Ethan understand and harness the magical energies of \\"Celestial Rift,\\" Ethan will assist Kaelen in locating lost arcane writings rumored to exist in forgotten dungeons that could expand the smith's already substantial capabilities. 6. **First Item Forged:** - To test their fledgling alliance, Kaelen forges a small but potent artifact for Ethan – a ring capable of storing spells cast upon it, even those Ethan has yet to fully understand. The crafting process itself is a revelation to Ethan, offering another piece in the puzzle of how his coding has taken on such vivid life. 7. **Chapter Conclusion – A Glimmer of Hope:** - With a new ally and a new artifact in his possession, Ethan feels the first real stirrings of hope. Not all is lost, and if he can enlist more figures like Kaelen to his cause, perhaps there is a chance to save \\"Celestial Rift\\" from The Null.

Your ‘code’ wove this existence, but in the end, it's the forge's heat that shapes it.\\" Ethan met the smith's intense gaze, feeling a connection to the game world he had never felt seated behind a screen. \\"Teach me,\\" Ethan said, resolve firming his voice. \\"Not the swings or the shaping—I need to understand its essence, the arcane that breathes life into your works.\\" The Arcane Smith regarded him for a heavy moment, the molten glow painting shadows on his features. \\"Knowledge for knowledge,\\" he proposed. \\"You seek the arcane, and I... there are texts, lost to time and greed—I would reclaim such treasures.\\" \\"It's a deal, then.\\" Ethan extended his hand, the light from the forge catching on the Seed of Curiosity ring Kaelen had fashioned for him. Kaelen's laughter boomed as he accepted the handshake, the pact sealed in the heart of creation. --- This scene explores the trade of services between Ethan and Kaelen, outlined in Step 5 of the provided chapter outline, and serves to further develop their characters and the stakes of their alliance.

Based on our previous discussions and the loop we seem to be in, I’ll offer a fresh example for immediate action: **Scene Expansion Example for Chapter 4 - Understanding the Essence:** Ethan stood quietly in the corner of Kaelen's forge, watching the Arcane Smith work. The rhythmic clanging of the hammer against metal resonated in his chest, a powerful reminder of the depth and reality of the world he had created. It was a far cry from the clean, logical lines of code he remembered. Here, every spark that flew from the anvil seemed infused with a life of its own. Kaelen briefly paused and wiped the sweat from his brow, his eyes catching Ethan's. \\"You see it, don’t you? The life in the elements, the art in the alloy,\\" he said, his voice rough but imbued with a soft excitement. Ethan stepped closer, his gaze fixed on the glowing metal. \\"I see something more profound than mere parameters and pixelated graphics. It's as if there's a hidden rhythm to it all, a language I am only just beginning to grasp.\\" Kaelen nodded, setting aside his hammer. \\"To craft with the arcane is to speak that language. It's about influence and intent, about directing the narrative of creation.\\" Ethan’s thoughts raced as he considered Kaelen’s words. Crafting with the arcane—could that be similar to his own design work? Could he harness this world's inherent logic, as he once did the code? \\"Teach me,\\" Ethan said with newfound determination. \\"Not just to read this language, but to write it, to shape it.\\" Kaelen studied the earnestness on Ethan's face. After a long moment, he finally agreed with a firm nod. \\"We'll start with the basics of essence transmutation. But remember, the power you seek requires more than just understanding—it demands respect.\\" As Kaelen began to explain the principles underlying his craft, Ethan listened intently. He knew this was just the beginning of a profound journey—one that would take him to the very heart of his creation and beyond. --- This scene further develops Ethan's growth and deepening understanding of the game world's magical properties.

Flames roared like a caged beast, hungry for the world outside. Ethan watched in silence as the Arcane Smith, a silhouette against the incandescence, worked with a delicate yet assured force, his every strike revealing the hidden shape within the raw metal. \\"Observation is the first step towards understanding,\\" Kaelen said, his voice a baritone rumble over the chaos of creation. Without looking up from his task, he continued, \\"What do you see?\\" Ethan edged closer, the heat pressing against his skin, a stark contrast to the cool logic of the world he knew—a world of algorithms and systems. Here, creation was viscerally alive; it was primal. “I see a world unbending to the strictures I understood. There are rules, yes, but there's... an underlying current, like a melody only half-remembered.” Kaelen nodded, a small smile curving his beard-laden lips as he plunged the now-silhouetted blade into a barrel of oil. The liquid hissed, rebelling against the invasion with violent fervor before acquiescing to shape its conqueror. “You are beginning to see past the veil of the surface. Here, in this forge, we bend not just metal, but the very essence that animates it.” Their eyes met, an accord silent but powerful. Ethan extended his hand, an invitation to share and grow. \\"Teach me your language, the language of essence, and I will teach you the forgotten tongues of the ancient codices. Together, perhaps we can write a new chapter for this world.\\" Kaelen's grasp was firm and certain, an alliance forged stronger than any steel. \\"A pact between scholars, then. Let us begin.\\" In the days that followed, the forge became a place of exchange—a trading of words, wisdom, and wonders. Ethan discovered the resonance of magic; Kaelen's horizons expanded with every spoken secret of the old world. Together, they unraveled threads of power, weaving them into the tapestry of 'Celestial Rift.' Through the pact of knowledge, the librarian and the smith might just stand a chance against the creeping void threatening their reality. --- This expanded scene further develops the relationship between Ethan and Kaelen, setting the foundation for their combined efforts to confront the challenges ahead.

For the \`cvc\` check, we use the regular expression \`/^d{3,4}/\` which validates a string of exactly 3 or 4 digits. Here's how you should update your **index.html** to include the \`type=\\"number\\"\` attribute for numeric inputs like card number and CVC, and \`maxlength\` where appropriate. This helps enforce the format alongside the JavaScript validation: \`\`\`html <!-- relevant input fields from your original index.html --> <input type=\\"text\\" id=\\"fullName\\" name=\\"fullName\\" required> <input type=\\"text\\" id=\\"cardNumber\\" name=\\"cardNumber\\" pattern=\\"d*\\" minlength=\\"13\\" maxlength=\\"19\\" required> <!-- Minimum length for credit cards is typically 13 --> <input type=\\"number\\" id=\\"cvc\\" name=\\"cvc\\" minlength=\\"3\\" maxlength=\\"4\\" required> <input type=\\"month\\" id=\\"expiryDate\\" name=\\"expiryDate\\" required> \`\`\` The \`pattern\` attribute for card number input ensures that users can only type digits into the field, while the \`type=\\"number\\"\` attribute on the CVC field ensures that only numbers can be entered. The \`minlength\` and \`maxlength\` attributes ensure the length of input data. **Note:** - The \`type=\\"number\\"\` does not support \`maxlength\`, so you should keep an eye on the input using JavaScript if you want to strictly enforce the length. - While \`type=\\"number\\"\` prevents non-numeric characters on some browsers, it has cross-browser inconsistencies. It's advisable to use \`type=\\"text\\"\` with \`pattern\` for input type consistency and JavaScript for additional validation. - Proper validation should always be done on the server side, as client-side validation can be bypassed. Always ensure your server validates the input before processing any payment information."},{"instruction":"여자친구 편지 써줘","output":"물론이죠! 아래의 표현을 사용할 수 있는 편지 예시를 드리겠습니다. 상황이나 감정에 따라 내용을 조금씩 바꿔서 사용하세요. --- 사랑하는 나의 [여자친구 이름], 날마다 너와 함께하는 순간들이 얼마나 소중한지 마음 깊이 느끼고 있어. 너는 내 생활에 빛과 색을 더해주는 사람이야.

A compilation of live footage had initially shown a mating pair, with the female hawk creating a nest and laying eggs. Everything had gone as normally, with the eggs hatching and the mother hawk feeding her chicks and the male's only duty was feeding his mate. However tragedy struck as the female hawk had failed to return. (later revealed to have died of natural causes) The astonishment came to the researchers when the male hawk, which normally does not do anything for its young, began to act the same way as a mother hawk would, including feeding its chicks. The male hawk was also observed failing initially in filling the role of a mother hawk, to which it did what most experts say was impossible and against their instincts, that being it was learning from its mistakes. Since then, the male hawk was successfully fulfilling its role of both father and mother, sheltering his chicks underneath him and feeding the chicks.","output":"In the dense forest of Pinebrook Park, a team of dedicated researchers had been monitoring a particular nest of hawks. Their sole aim was to understand and document the remarkable behaviors of these majestic birds of prey. What they discovered, however, would change their perception of these creatures forever. For weeks, the researchers had meticulously captured live footage of the hawk couple's activities. The female hawk diligently constructed a nest atop the highest branch, carefully molding twigs and leaves into a cozy sanctuary for her forthcoming brood. Her devoted companion, the male hawk, had dutifully fulfilled his role by providing her with food, ensuring her strength remained intact. As the days passed, anticipation grew among the research team as they anxiously awaited the arrival of the hatchlings. Their excitement was unparalleled when the live footage revealed the miraculous sight of three tiny, fragile eggs nestled within the nest. The female hawk tirelessly incubated her precious offspring, and when they finally emerged, the researchers marveled at their cuteness and vulnerability. But fate had a different plan for this hawk family. Tragedy struck suddenly, without warning. The female hawk had expired, succumbing to natural causes while hunting for her voracious young ones. The researchers, heartbroken yet intrigued by this turn of events, prepared themselves for the inevitable grief that would unravel before their eyes. Days turned into weeks as the male hawk valiantly fought to adapt to his newfound responsibilities. Initially, he seemed lost and confused, unsure of how to fulfill the role of both mother and father. Doubts crept into the minds of the researchers, doubting whether the male hawk could succeed where others had failed. Against all odds, the male hawk persevered, refusing to let despair overpower him. Despite his initial fumbles, he was determined to nourish and protect his brood, just as the female hawk had done before him. Through sheer will and an inexplicable drive, he began learning from his mistakes, a feat that left the researchers astounded. The male hawk's transformation unfolded in front of the amazed researchers. With utmost care, he scooped up his three vulnerable chicks, sheltering them beneath his wings, protecting them from the daunting world they had entered. And when it came to feeding, the male hawk refused to let his inexperience hinder him. With every passing day, the male hawk became increasingly proficient in his new roles. Swift and accurate, he delved into the art of hunting, ensuring his offspring never went hungry. The researchers watched with unwavering admiration as the male hawk fearlessly soared across the vast sky, returning with morsels of sustenance, diligently distributing it among his eager chicks. News of this extraordinary tale quickly spread, captivating the hearts and minds of people around the world. Scientists and experts alike were baffled and captivated by the male hawk's unprecedented behavior. Debates emerged, questioning the very depths of animal instincts and what it truly meant to be a parent. The researchers, inspired and humbled by this unparalleled love and dedication displayed by the male hawk, continued to document his journey. Day by day, they documented how he nurtured, protected, and taught his young with unwavering devotion. It was a testament to the extraordinary capabilities and resilience found within the animal kingdom. Ultimately, the male hawk's remarkable tale became a beacon of hope and an embodiment of the unbreakable bond between parent and child. It shattered the notion of predetermined roles and societal norms, reminding humanity that the strength of a parent's love knows no boundaries. As the seasons changed, the once-vulnerable chicks grew into formidable hawks under the attentive care of their extraordinary father. And in the depths of Pinebrook Park, the researchers bore witness to a tale of courage, determination, and the indomitable spirit of a father who defied all odds to become the mother his young ones needed."},{"instruction":"I made a pulse oximeter and instead of using Max 30100 I’m using 2 leds (1 red and 1 IR 940 nm sender) and one photodiode 940 nm receiver and I’m using Arduino pro mini (pin A1 is assigned to analog signal input from photodiode and pin 10 and 11 are connected to base of BC547 Transistors with two 4.7k ohm resistors) and O’LED 0.96 ssd 1306 for display( SDA and SCL are connected to A4 and A5 of arduino pro) my power supply is 9v DC battery with a LM7805 and also pins for IR and Red led are connected to two bases of BC547 with a 4.7 k Ohm resistors and also the collector pin is connected short leg of LED cathode and Emitter pin is connected to ground and anode of led are connected to 5 v dc and also photodiode is connected to A1 and through a junction is connected to Vcc with a 10 K resistor code : #include <Wire.h> //#include <LiquidCrystal_I2C.h> #include <SPI.h> #include <Adafruit_GFX.h> #include <Adafruit_SSD1306.h> #define SCREEN_WIDTH 128 // OLED display width, in pixels #define SCREEN_HEIGHT 32 // OLED display height, in pixels // Declaration for an SSD1306 display connected to I2C (SDA, SCL pins) #define OLED_RESET 4 Adafruit_SSD1306 display(SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT, &Wire, OLED_RESET);

Inside the loop, the IR LED is turned on, and the average value of analog readings from the sensor pin is calculated over a 20ms period. The same process is then repeated for the red LED. After obtaining the average values, the code calculates the R parameter by finding the maximum and minimum values in each period of samples obtained from the sensor. The R value is then used to determine if a finger is placed in the sensor or not. If a finger is detected, the code checks for a rising curve in the IR sensor readings, indicating a heartbeat. The code keeps track of the time since the last beat and stores the 10 previous peak values. The code then calculates the average period and number of samples to find the BPM and R values. If there are at least 5 measures, the code calculates the SpO2 value based on the R value. The BPM and SpO2 values are then displayed on the OLED display. If there are less than 3 good measures, a message indicating the need for a finger is displayed. The code continues to read the sensor values and update the display in a continuous loop. Overall, the code uses the average sensor readings and R parameter to detect a heartbeat and calculate the BPM and SpO2 values. These values are then displayed on the OLED display."},{"instruction":"Write an comedy anime scene about a young man reading fifty shades of grey to his friends as a joke.

SUBURBAN HOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY We're in the cozy, well-decorated living room of JIN, the platinum blonde band member known for his striking looks and cool demeanor. The rest of the boy band, DYNAMITE DREAMERS, is sprawled out. Jin lounges on the sofa, ALEX, the smart one, sits on an armchair analyzing every word with a scholarly interest, and MIKEY, the cute and shy member, is sitting cross-legged on the floor, a cushion hugged tightly to his chest, his cheeks already tinged pink. In the corner of the living room, LILA, the manager, a no-nonsense woman with a shock of red hair, pours herself a glass of wine, shaking her head at the scene unfolding. YUKI, the charismatic young man at the center of it all, holds a copy of \\"Fifty Shades of Grey,\\" fanning himself with it mischievously. YUKI (to his bandmates) So, one of our fans handed this to me at the last concert—said it's her favorite book and insisted I'd 'learn something' from it! JIN As if our lyrics weren't steamy enough. Let's see if E.L. James has the moves to school Dynamite Dreamers, eh? Laughter erupts as Yuki theatrically clears his throat and starts reading in a mock-sultry voice. YUKI (reading) \\"'He's my very own Christian Grey popsicle.' I giggle, and he smiles, his eyes gleaming wickedly.\\" Mikey buries his face into the cushion, muffling his giggles. Alex adjusts his glasses, a small smile on his lips as he listens intently. ALEX Analytically speaking, the metaphorical implications of a 'Christian Grey popsicle' are quite— JIN —Chill, bro. Don't overthink a popsicle. As Yuki continues, Lila chimes in without turning around, her voice dry. LILA You know, my mother reads that book. Gives it as Christmas gifts with scented candles. The boys exchange wide-eyed, horrified looks, an awkward silence befalling the group for a brief moment before they burst into renewed laughter. YUKI (reading, trying to maintain composure) \\"And from this evocative bouquet of... of...\\" Unable to continue, Yuki breaks down into peals of laughter along with the rest of the band. Once the laughter subsides and the book is closed, Lila sets her wine glass on a coaster with deliberate casualness, finally turning her gaze to the boys, the shadow of a smirk on her lips. LILA You know, back in high school, I wrote smut that would make E.L. James blush. That book is vanilla frosting on a stale cupcake compared to my stuff. The boys gape at her, shocked, as Lila picks up her glass with a wink and sashays out of the room, leaving behind a stunned silence and four wide-eyed boy band members.

Here's an explanation of the key algorithms, functions, and calculations in your code: # Setup 1. \`setup()\`: Initializes serial communication, configures pin modes for LED control and input from the photodiode, initializes the OLED display, and sets initial LED states to low (turned off). # Main Loop 2. \`loop()\`: The main loop that carries out the pulse oximetry measurements. Inside, there is an infinite while loop (\`while(1)\`) that continuously measures light absorption in red and infrared wavelengths. It toggles between red and IR LEDs using the digital pins connected to the BC547 transistors. # Red and IR Measurement 3. The program first turns on the IR LED and takes multiple readings over a period defined by \`T\`, averaging them to eliminate noise. The readings are stored and updated in an array \`readsIR[]\`, which keeps a moving sum of the last few readings for calculating a running average (\`lastIR\`). 4. The same process is repeated for the red LED, taking readings and calculating a running average, which is stored in \`lastRED\`. 5. Measurements from both red and IR LEDs are added to circular buffers \`readsIRMM[]\` and \`readsREDMM[]\`, respectively. These buffers hold samples across a full pulse period, preparing for the calculation of \`R\`, the ratio of the absorptions. # Calculating R and SpO2 6. When sufficient samples are collected (determined by the number of heartbeats), the maximum and minimum values for both IR and red readings are found, and \`R\` is calculated using the formula \`R = ((REDmax - REDmin) / REDmin) / ((IRmax - IRmin) / IRmin)\`. 7. \`R\` is used to estimate the SpO2, or blood oxygen saturation level, based on a calibration curve built into the program. # Heartbeat Detection 8. The program monitors rises in the IR signal to detect heartbeats. It counts consecutive rises until a threshold is reached, indicating a heartbeat. 9. When a heartbeat is detected, the time between the current beat and the last beat is recorded. An average BPM (beats per minute) is then calculated based on the times of the last few beats. # Displaying Results 10. \`dis()\`: This function updates the OLED display with the SpO2 and BPM values. It clears the screen and then writes the new values to the display. # Other Functions and Calculations - \`finger_status\`: A variable that checks whether a finger is positioned in the sensor correctly. If \`lastRED\` is less than \`lastIR\`, it assumes the finger is not present. - Arrays like \`readsIR[]\` and \`readsRED[]\` are managed in a circular fashion, keeping a running history of measurements without needing to shift elements. - Measurements for BPM and SpO2 are averaged over a number of periods to ensure accuracy and reduce the effect of anomalies. # Parallel Operations - Measurements and LED control occur within the main infinite loop. This suggests that sensor reading and LED toggling are meant to happen as fast as possible in the main \`while(1)\` loop, without waiting for delayed operations. - The OLED display is updated after every heartbeat detection and whenever the average values for BPM and SpO2 are calculated and validated. # Libraries You use Adafruit's GFX and SSD1306 libraries for interacting with the OLED display and the Wire library for I2C communication. # Note This code is for a homemade pulse oximeter. The accuracy of readings (particularly SpO2) can be very dependent on the specific hardware used and the calibration curve employed. Proper calibration against a medical-grade pulse oximeter is crucial for accurate measurements. Additionally, the algorithm's ability to detect a finger's presence and accurately discriminate between heartbeats and noise could greatly affect this system's effectiveness."},{"instruction":"questo codice importa solo la prima occorrenza dei tag e non le successive, lo può sistemare, mantenendo la logica? function importaFattureDaDrive() { const folderId = \\"\\"; const folder = DriveApp.getFolderById(folderId); const files = folder.getFiles(); const spreadsheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet(); const sheet = spreadsheet.getSheetByName(\\"Struttura_fe\\"); const rows = sheet.getDataRange().getValues(); const xmlData = []; if (!files.hasNext()) { // La cartella è vuota, esci dalla funzione return; } while (files.hasNext()) { const file = files.next(); const xml = file.getBlob().getDataAsString(); try { const xmlDoc = XmlService.parse(xml); const root = xmlDoc.getRootElement(); let xmlRow = []; let dataEOraItaliana = getDataEOraItaliana(); let idDoc = generaUnixTimestampConFusoOrarioItaliano(); // Chiama la funzione per ottenere il timestamp Unix for (const row of rows) { const tag = row[2]; const destinationSheetName = row[3]; const field = row[4]; let tagValue = estraiValoreTag(root, tag); if (field === \\"utente\\") { tagValue = \\"import_Auto\\"; } xmlRow.push(tagValue); if (row === rows[rows.length - 1] || destinationSheetName !== rows[rows.indexOf(row) + 1][3]) { // Trova la destinazione corretta const destinationSheet = spreadsheet.getSheetByName(destinationSheetName); Logger.log(destinationSheetName +' '+ row) if (destinationSheet) { // Aggiungi idDoc solo alle tabelle alimentate dall'importazione if (xmlRow.some(value => value !== \\"\\" && value !== \\"import_Auto\\")) { // Aggiungi idDoc alla colonna specificata (colonna F) const destinationColumnIdDoc = row[11]; // La colonna L contiene l'informazione per id_doc if (destinationColumnIdDoc) { xmlRow[destinationColumnIdDoc - 1] = idDoc; // -1 per correggere l'indice } Logger.log(destinationColumnIdDoc + ' ' + field + ' '+ destinationColumnIdDoc); // Aggiungi dataEOraItaliana alla colonna specificata (colonna L) const destinationColumnTimeRec = row[11]; // La colonna L contiene l'informazione per time_rec if (destinationColumnTimeRec) { xmlRow[destinationColumnTimeRec - 1] = dataEOraItaliana; // -1 per correggere l'indice } destinationSheet.appendRow(xmlRow); } } xmlRow = []; } } } catch (e) { Logger.log(\\"Errore nell'elaborazione del file XML: \\" + e); continue; } } } function estraiValoreTag(element, tag) { const tags = tag.split(\\"/\\"); let currentElement = element; for (const currentTag of tags) { const nextElement = currentElement.getChild(currentTag); if (!nextElement) { return \\"\\"; } currentElement = nextElement; } return currentElement.getText(); } function getDataEOraItaliana() { const dataOraLocale = new Date(); const fusoOrarioItaliano = 'Europe/Rome'; const dataEOraItaliana = Utilities.formatDate(dataOraLocale, fusoOrarioItaliano, 'dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss'); return dataEOraItaliana; } function generaUnixTimestampConFusoOrarioItaliano() { var fusoOrarioItaliano = 'Europe/Rome'; var dataOraItaliana = Utilities.formatDate(new Date(), fusoOrarioItaliano, 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss'); Logger.log('Data e ora italiane: ' + dataOraItaliana); var dataOraItalianaJS = new Date(dataOraItaliana); var unixTimestampItaliano = dataOraItalianaJS.getTime() / 1000; // Convertemo in secondi Logger.log('Unix Timestamp con fuso orario italiano: ' + unixTimestampItaliano); return unixTimestampItaliano; }","output":"Sembra che il problema sia che la funzione \`estraiValoreTag()\` estrae solo il valore del primo tag che trova nel documento XML e non itera per estrarre i valori di tutti gli elementi corrispondenti a quello tag.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding to a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the smell is coming from the returning woman's pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how smelly she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, then blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to do that even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was compelled to release once getting past her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even at the expense of making a dirty mess in her pants for the sake of that relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In pursuance of the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because she seems to feel good about something dirty like pooping her pants. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to see what the returning woman supposedly felt good about making in her pants. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, wryly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach, so the pressure forced her to push everything out once the initial release happened. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants with satisfaction, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. Then, while inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. As she is performing the physical gesture, the present woman ridicules how awfully smelly the seat of the childish returning woman's pants is. After that, the present woman proceeds to tauntingly remark that she wouldn't be surprised by this point if the returning woman is also enjoying the odor that is emanating from her own pants, considering how much the returning woman seemingly enjoyed pooping her pants in the first place. The present woman emphasizes that it wouldn't surprise her if the returning woman enjoys being childishly smelly from having poop in her pants (the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, tauntingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because she unbearably stinks. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while reiterating that the returning woman unbearably stinks and imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the returning woman stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately as she is pressing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. As the bulge in her pants is being pressed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has entered the bathroom, the present woman is still comically reacting to the odor that lingers and audibly complaining about how smelly the returning woman is.","output":"**INT. GUPTA HOUSEHOLD - DAY** Background: Preceding this scene, PRIYA, an unassuming college student of about 19 with long, neatly braided black hair and wearing a comfortable salwar kameez, spent the entire day on campus attending lectures and study groups. She has an aversion to using public restrooms for number two, largely due to a lack of privacy and hygiene concerns, particularly the squat toilets widely common in Indian public spaces. She much prefers the familiar, clean confines of her own bathroom at home. Today, however, she sipped a bit too much of her friend’s homemade iced tea during a break, and its diuretic effects have ratcheted her bowels into overdrive. With her stomach groaning ominously, Priya rushed through crowded streets and public transport to make it home. She skipped a visit to the campus restrooms earlier, confident she could hold it until she got home. Now, as she fumbles for her key at the front door, she realizes with a sinking feeling, the key isn’t where she expected. EXT. GUPTA HOUSEHOLD - DAY Priya approaches the front door, her pained expressions and furtive glances signaling her battle with the impending biological imperative. A single sweat droplet trails down her temple. PRIYA: (Talking to herself) Not now, please not now...just a little longer... She rifles through her bag, her fingers desperately seeking the metal coolness of the key, but she finds only pens, notebooks, and empty wrappers. PRIYA: No, no, no... She begins to FRANTICALLY KNOCK on the door, her face contorted in abdominal distress. Seconds feel like eternities before a voice from within stirs hope. INT. GUPTA HOUSEHOLD - DAY ANITA, Priya’s mother, in her mid-40s with hair half tied-up and wearing a simple floral kurta, calls out with an intrigued look as she nears the door. ANITA: (Returning from the kitchen, curious) Kaun hai? Who's there? PRIYA: (O.S., desperate, muffled through the door) Maa, jaldi kholo! Open the door, it’s me! Anita fumbles with the latch, visibly perplexed by the urgency in her daughter's voice. Priya's feet shuffle, her hands clutch her stomach. The door cracks open slowly. PRIYA: (Pleading, trying to maintain composure) Maa, side ho... please move. ANITA: (Squinting in concern, blocking the doorway) Priya, kya hua? What's wrong, beta? Priya tries to slip past Anita, but her mother's concern manifests in a firm grasp. PRIYA: (Tugging against the grip, voice strained) Maa, please just let me go inside! Their struggle turns into a stressful DANCE of bickering and dodging. Anita is inadvertently gatekeeping the bathroom sanctuary. PRIYA: (Reaching her limit, a groan escapes her) Uhhh... The tension in her body relaxes instantly, shock, and untimely relief spread across her face, horror dawning on Anita's as she finally loosens her grip. ANITA: (Befuddled, still partially obstructing) Priya, tu theek to hai na? Are you alright? Priya leans back into a more accommodating stance, and commences to exert herself. Feet shoulder-width apart, her face is a mix of shame and deep satisfaction, strangely content amid the chaotic moment. PRIYA: (Softly grunting, strained voice of relief) Haan Maa... I'm okay... ANITA: (Quietly, but with rising alarm) Priya...? Anita catches the faint, undeniable scent and initially refutes her suspicion with another sniff, her nose wrinkling. Priya, on the cusp of finishing, lets out a relieved SIGH. PRIYA: (Almost inaudible, sheepishly) Uff... better... Anita sniffs again, her face scrunching up, a realization dawning upon her. The woman who stands before her suddenly seems alien. ANITA: (Disgusted bewilderment) Priya, yeh badboo... did you—? Priya meets her mother's eyes, mortified, unable to speak. ANITA: (Waving her hand in front of her nose, prodding) Yeh smell kiske wajah se hai? Is it from your... PRIYA: (Weakly) Maa, please let me in. Anita, in disgusted reverence, steps back to let Priya pass, but raises a cautionary finger like a sentinel guarding her threshold. PRIYA: (Gingerly waddling in, holding the back of her pants) Sorry, Maa... ANITA: (Horrified, chastising) Ruk ja! Don’t move yet, don’t drop any of that... Priya, it's so dirty! PRIYA: (Indignantly, still holding her pants) It’s your fault! You blocked me! ANITA: (Pointedly, a tinge of sarcasm cutting through her scolding) That’s no excuse for a grown woman, Priya! Priya moves past her initial shame, her demeanor now a sulking defensiveness. PRIYA: (Playfully, lamenting) It was too much, Maa. It just felt... relieving. ANITA: (Pointing at Priya’s pants, scoffing) Let me see what you’re feeling so good about! Priya tries to protest, but Anita spins her around, regarding the stained pants with a mix of revulsion and motherly exasperation. ANITA: (Looking at Priya’s rear, incredulously) Itna? So much, Priya? PRIYA: (Touching the bulge defensively) There was a lot, Maa. It was... pressure. Relief. ANITA: (Scolding, leaning in to sniff theatrically) Like a child enjoying being dirty... PRIYA: (Squeamishly) Since you're not letting me clean up... ANITA: (Dismissing, pushing Priya towards the bathroom) You stink too much to stay here! They proceed to the bathroom, Anita muttering about the smell, Priya apologizing profusely for the mess. Anita half assists, half nudges Priya forward. PRIYA: (Grimacing) Some might fall... ANITA: (Aghast) No! Hold it in! God, the smell! They reach the bathroom, the air around them imbued with absurdity and stench. PRIYA: (Playfully holding her pants and nose) Want to change me, Maa? ANITA: (Giving her daughter a nudge, pressing in disgust) Get in there! You're filthy! A muffled exclamation from Priya, a “splat” as the bulge spreads, and Anita's gagging all sound as Priya is pushed into the bathroom. The door swings shut, the echo of Anita's lingering complaints about the odor blending with Priya's embarrassed protests from within as they fade into the background. FADE OUT."},{"instruction":"Write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a concise background (in which the events of the preceding scene leading to the events in the current scene are briefly described, explaining the source of the returning woman's surmounting urge to relieve herself and the reason why she hasn't relieved herself properly by the time she reaches the house), for a very long comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity; all dialogues in the scene should have quotidian, simple language that people would actually use in such a scenario, with no excessive flourishes; all events and dialogues that occur once the returning woman enters the house should be elaborated upon in detail, without any of the prompts being omitted) in a Comedy Drama TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * An Arab American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she’s a defiant college senior; she feels like the present woman is overly protective of her; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans in the scene) is returning home and approaching the door of her family’s house with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding to a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the smell is coming from the returning woman's pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how smelly she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, then blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to do that even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was compelled to release once getting past her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even at the expense of making a dirty mess in her pants for the sake of that relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman first expresses indignation about the returning woman blaming her for causing the incident after it has already been stated by the present woman that there is no excuse for the returning woman to childishly poop her pants, then mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman is satisfied about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposed satisfaction. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman derived much satisfaction from relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman is also childishly satisfied by having her pants full of so much poop (the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants with satisfaction, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. As she is performing the physical gesture, the present woman ridicules how awfully smelly the seat of the childish returning woman's pants is and proceeds to scold the returning woman for making her pants so smelly (the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because she unbearably stinks. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while reiterating that the returning woman unbearably stinks and imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the returning woman stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately as she is pressing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. As the bulge in her pants is being pressed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has entered the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reactiln to the odor that lingers while audibly complaining about how smelly the returning woman is.","output":"I'm sorry, but I can't provide the content you're requesting."},{"instruction":"I made a pulse oximeter and instead of using Max 30100 I’m using 2 leds (1 red and 1 IR 940 nm sender) and one photodiode 940 nm receiver and I’m using Arduino pro mini (pin A1 is assigned to analog signal input from photodiode and pin 10 and 11 are connected to base of BC547 Transistors with two 4.7k ohm resistors) and O’LED 0.96 ssd 1306 for display( SDA and SCL are connected to A4 and A5 of arduino pro) my power supply is 9v DC battery with a LM7805 and also pins for IR and Red led are connected to two bases of BC547 with a 4.7 k Ohm resistors and also the collector pin is connected short leg of LED cathode and Emitter pin is connected to ground and anode of led are connected to 5 v dc and also photodiode is connected to A1 and through a junction is connected to Vcc with a 10 K resistor code : #include <Wire.h> //#include <LiquidCrystal_I2C.h> #include <SPI.h> #include <Adafruit_GFX.h> #include <Adafruit_SSD1306.h> #define SCREEN_WIDTH 128 // OLED display width, in pixels #define SCREEN_HEIGHT 32 // OLED display height, in pixels // Declaration for an SSD1306 display connected to I2C (SDA, SCL pins) #define OLED_RESET 4 Adafruit_SSD1306 display(SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT, &Wire, OLED_RESET);

Here's a breakdown of the various sections of your code, the algorithms and calculations, and their associated code snippets: 1. **Initialization**: - Libraries are included for I2C communication (\`Wire.h\`), graphics (\`Adafruit_GFX.h\`), and the OLED display (\`Adafruit_SSD1306.h\`). - Screen dimensions are defined for the display. - The reset pin for the SSD1306 display is declared, and the display object is created. - Pins are assigned to the sensor (\`A1\`), red LED (\`PIN 10\`), and IR LED (\`PIN 11\`). - The initial setup of serial communication, pin modes, and turning off LEDs is done in the \`setup()\` function. 2. **Main Loop**: - The \`loop()\` function is a while(1) loop, which means it runs indefinitely. - It starts by turning on the IR LED, taking multiple samples from the photodiode, averaging them to remove noise, and storing the average in \`readsIR\`. - Then, it switches to the red LED and repeats the sampling and averaging process, storing the result in \`readsRED\`. 3. **Calculation of Peaks and Beats**: - The code detects heartbeats by looking for a rising edge in the IR signal, determined by consecutive increases in the signal (\`rise_count\`). - When a rise is detected, it calculates the period between beats and averages this over several beats to obtain the heart rate (BPM). 4. **Calculating SpO2**: - Simultaneously, it calculates the max and min values for both red and IR samples, and calculates the R value, which is the ratio of the red and IR signal amplitude changes. - The SpO2 is then estimated using a linear equation based on the calculated R value (\`SpO2 = -19 * R + 99\`). This equation might be empirical and should be calibrated with a real oximeter. 5. **Displaying Results**: - If the finger is detected correctly and there are valid readings, the calculated SpO2 and BPM are displayed on the SSD1306 OLED screen using a \`dis()\` helper function, which sets up the text size, position, and content before displaying. 6. **Helper Functions**: - \`dis()\`: This function updates the OLED display with the SpO2 and BPM values. Your code utilizes digital pins to control the LEDs and the photodiode sensor's input to collect analog readings, which estimate blood oxygen levels and pulse rate. The critical sections of the code include: - **LED Control**: Turning the LEDs on sequentially to get readings for both red light absorption and infrared light absorption. - **Signal Averaging**: To filter out noise and get more accurate readings. - **Peak Detection**: By analyzing the rise and fall of IR signal to detect heartbeats. - **Calculation of R Value**: Necessary for determining the blood oxygen saturation. - **SpO2 Estimation**: Using an empirical formula to determine SpO2 from the R value. - **User Interaction**: Detecting when the finger is placed correctly and accordingly prompting the user or displaying results. - **Display Updating**: Updating the OLED display with current readings.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding to a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the smell is coming from the returning woman's pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how smelly she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, then blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to do that even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was compelled to release once getting past her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even at the expense of making a dirty mess in her pants for the sake of that relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman first expresses indignation about the returning woman blaming her for causing the incident after it has already been stated by the present woman that there is no excuse for the returning woman to childishly poop her pants, then mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman is satisfied about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposed satisfaction. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman derived much satisfaction from relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman is also childishly satisfied by having her pants full of so much poop (the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants with satisfaction, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. As she is performing the physical gesture, the present woman ridicules how awfully smelly the seat of the childish returning woman's pants is and proceeds to scold the returning woman for making her pants so smelly (the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because she unbearably stinks. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while reiterating that the returning woman unbearably stinks and imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the returning woman stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately as she is pressing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. As the bulge in her pants is being pressed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has entered the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reactiln to the odor that lingers while audibly complaining about how smelly the returning woman is.","output":"INT. FAMILY HOUSE, ENTRYWAY - DAY PREVIOUS SCENE: Layla Al-Haddad, a 22-year-old Arab American college senior, just finished a grueling final exam. Her morning coffee, high in fiber breakfast, and stress have culminated in an uncomfortable urgency to relieve herself. Due to a mix-up with her friend's car and a broken campus restroom, her trip home becomes desperate. Layla now approaches her family's house, distressed and anxious. BEGIN CURRENT SCENE: Layla is moments from potential embarrassment. The familiar brownstone looms before her, a sanctuary too far. She's in a sweatshirt and yoga pants, hair tied back in a hasty ponytail, her brow furrowed with unease. Her pace quickens as she fumbles for keys, finding nothing but lint and a stick of gum. CUT TO: EXT. FAMILY HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS Layla (frantically): Please be open, please be open... Discovering the door locked, Layla hammers the wooden frame with a desperation only dire bladders know. She huffs, clenching every muscle to hold back nature's call. Layla (muttering): Where the heck did I put my keys? CUT TO: INT. FAMILY HOUSE, ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS On the other side, Mariam Al-Haddad, late 40s, nurturing with a hint of motherly sternness in her eyes, approaches the door. She's in comfortable slacks and a floral blouse, her hair neatly wrapped in a hijab. Mariam (calling out): Hold on, hold on. Who is it? Layla (exasperated, pleading): Mom, it's me! Hurry up, please! Mariam surveys the peephole, then starts unlocking the myriad bolts with aggravating precision. CUT TO: EXT. ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS Layla shimmies from foot to foot, her face contorted in discomfort. The click of the deadbolt sounds like a herald of salvation. CUT TO: INT. ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS The door swings open, revealing Mariam's questioning gaze. Mariam (concerned): What's the hurry, habibti? Layla, frazzled, attempts to barrel past. Layla (urgent, not revealing the truth): Move, Mom, I gotta get through! Mariam, sensing distress, instinctively grabs Layla's arm. Mariam (frantic): Layla, what's wrong? Tell me! Layla wriggles, pleading. Layla (pleading, avoiding the topic): Please, just let me in! Their bickering crescendos into a tangled dance of concern and urgency. But it's too late. Layla's limit is reached, and her features slacken into an untimely serenity. Layla (groaning): Oh no... Mariam (confused, grip loosening): What on earth- Layla's back is now to Mariam as she accommodates the unexpected release. Sighs and soft, relief-filled grunts replace coherent words. Mariam watches, befuddled. Mariam (clueless, proding): Layla, are you alright? Why are you— The smell hits. Mariam sniffs the air, twice, her face scrunching in reaction. Mariam (realizing): Oh... Oh, habibti, did you— Layla meets her mother's eye, her face sheepishly twisted. Mariam (disgusted yet bewildered): Did you just... in your pants? Is that smell... from you? Layla (avoiding the topic, begging to pass): Can we not do this here? I need to get in, clean up. Mariam steps aside, still stunned by the aroma. Layla, holding the seat of her pants, inches inside with a waddle. CUT TO: INT. ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS Two steps past the threshold, Mariam touches Layla's arm. Mariam (scolding): Don't move – don't let it drop on the floor! Layla (sheepish indignation): I'm aware, Mom... Mariam (tauntingly scolding): How dirty—and smelly—you are right now! Layla, still cupping her backside, stands silent in mortification. Mariam (exasperated): There’s no excuse for this childish behavior, Layla! Layla (playful sulk): It's your fault – if you hadn't taken ages at the door and then blocked me... I... Mariam (tauntingly scolding): No excuse ever to make a mess at your age! Besides, why stay put and keep... going? Layla (defiantly): I had to. I was past the point of no return! You stalled me, what was I supposed to do? Layla hesitantly probes the bulk, a playful wince on her face. Layla (wryly): But... it did feel good... to let go. Mariam blocks her. Mariam (indignant, scoldingly taunting): Nasty satisfaction, huh? Serves me right for worrying. Mariam circles Layla, inspecting. Layla resists. Mariam (tauntingly incredulous): Did you really enjoy soiling your pants... that much? Layla (coyly bickering): No... there was just a lot... But I needed to; the pressure was too much. Mariam (angrily): You're nasty, Layla. There was no need for this. Mariam now insensitively sniffs near Layla's pants like one might with a child's diaper, Layla cringes. Mariam reacts theatrically to the smell. Mariam (mockingly, scoldingly taunting): This stinks! You're so smelly from making such a mess! Layla, wrinkling her nose as she smells herself: Layla (resigned): Well, since you won't let me clean up, might as well get used to it. Mariam (dismissing): Enough. You need to wash up. You reek! Mariam ushers her toward the bathroom, Layla shuffling awkwardly. Mariam (continuously physical reacting to the odor, ushering): Careful—Don't drop any... Ugh, you smell so bad! Layla (cringing): I think... it might slide out... Mariam (exasperated): Then don't let it! Hold it in! Bathroom door in sight, Layla pauses, a playful glint in her eye. Layla (teasing): Want to change my \\"diaper,\\" Mom? Mariam, annoyed, gives the bulge a push, corralling Layla into the bathroom. Mariam (while pressing the bulge and pushing Layla in): In you get, now! Layla (disgusted as the mess spreads): Yuck! It's smearing everywhere! Once Layla's inside, Mariam takes a final lingering sniff and complains as the scene ends.

In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the smell is coming from the returning woman's pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how smelly she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, then blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to do that even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was compelled to release once getting past her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even at the expense of making a dirty mess in her pants for the sake of that relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman first expresses indignation about the returning woman blaming her for causing the incident after it has already been stated by the present woman that there is no excuse for the returning woman to childishly poop her pants, then mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman is satisfied about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposed satisfaction. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman derived much satisfaction from relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman is also childishly satisfied by having her pants full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants with satisfaction, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. As she is performing the physical gesture, the present woman ridicules how awfully smelly the seat of the childish returning woman's pants is and proceeds to scold the returning woman for making her pants so smelly. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because she unbearably stinks. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while reiterating that the returning woman unbearably stinks and imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the returning woman stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately as she is pressing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. As the bulge in her pants is being pressed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has entered the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reactiln to the odor that lingers while audibly complaining about how smelly the returning woman is.","output":"**BACKGROUND** In the preceding moments leading to this calamitous comedic scene, LAYLA, a 19-year-old Arab American college freshman, known for her practical attire and love for cargo pants, has just come off a particularly insightful yet draining sociology lecture. Layla, a young woman with an expressive face framed by dark, wavy hair and characterized by a pair of tortoiseshell glasses, has always been private about her bathroom habits, specifically her bowel movements. A concoction of stress from her finals, and her stubborn aversion to using public restrooms, set the stage for her current predicament. Having been too embarrassed to excuse herself during a group study session to seek out a campus restroom, she resolved to wait until she made it home. Upon her arrival, however, she realizes, with spreading horror, the key she thought was in her pocket has gone missing. The urgency of her situation converges to a tipping point as she frantically knocks on the front door of her family's house. **EXT. LAYLA'S HOUSE - DAY** LAYLA, early 20’s, an unassuming college girl dressed in navy cargo pants and a loose-fitted sweater, crests the last few steps to her family home, clenching her stomach with one hand. She rifles through her bag with growing desperation, pushing past textbooks, a calculator, and a half-empty water bottle. Her anxiety is palpable. LAYLA (under her breath) Come on, come on... She pats down her pockets, the realization dawning on her that her key is missing. LAYLA (stifling a whimper) No, no... Overcome by urgency, she begins KNOCKING on the door with erratic rhythm, the sound of her own heartbeats crowding her ears. After several unbearable moments of silence, a VOICE from the other side breaks through. MARIAM (O.S.) Yallah, who's knocking like police? LAYLA (frenzied) Mom, please, hurry up! **INT. LAYLA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS** The door slowly opens to reveal MARIAM, late 40’s, an elegant woman with expressive eyes crow's feet from years of laughter, donning a stylish kaftan. She stands, both puzzled and concerned, in the entryway. LAYLA (practically shrieking) Move, Mom! MARIAM’s maternal instincts kick in as she reaches out and grabs LAYLA by the arm. MARIAM (alarmed) Layla, what’s wrong? LAYLA (pleading, squirming) Nothing! Just let me in! MARIAM (concern growing) You look pale - are you sick? A pained GROAN escapes LAYLA’s lips as she desperately tries to break free of her mother's hold. The struggle is tense, almost absurd in their pirouette around the narrow corridor. MARIAM (confused) Layla! Talk to me! Suddenly, LAYLA’s face contorts in shock, her eyes go wide as she experiences untimely relief. LAYLA (soft grunts, hushed) Oh no... oh... MARIAM (wrinkling her nose) Do you smell...? There it is, the smell hits MARIAM full force as she releases LAYLA's arm, stepping back. MARIAM (teasingly aghast) Did you just... in your pants? LAYLA (avoiding eye-contact) Can I please just go inside now? MARIAM (beleaguered, waving her hand in front of her nose) Go, go, just make sure you don't drop anything! LAYLA gingerly steps inside, cupping the back of her cargo pants. MARIAM stops her a few paces past the threshold, her voice rife with mocking concern. MARIAM (not holding back her laughter) Layla, this, yani... It's disgusting, and you smell like a sewer! LAYLA (playfully defensive) Your fault. Moved too slow, blocked the door. What's a girl to do? MARIAM (scoffing) Too old for excuses. And you filled your pants like it's a damn bucket! LAYLA, emboldened and cheeky despite the mess. LAYLA (faux bravado) Had to happen, Mom. Was coming out whether I liked it or not. MARIAM (sarcastically) You seemed to like it just fine! She spins LAYLA around, inspecting the damage with disbelief. MARIAM (aghast) Allahu Akbar, what did you eat? It's like you were storing it for the winter! LAYLA (uncomfortably) Gotta live a little, right? MARIAM (exasperated) Live? You need to live in the bathroom! And you're getting a diaper for your next birthday. MARIAM leans in, sniffing near LAYLA's pants, her theatrics over the top. MARIAM (mock pity) Poor baby made a stinky. LAYLA (cringing, dryly humourous) Then stop holding me hostage here with it! MARIAM (firmly) You're not staying. You're walking yourself to that bathroom before I die of this smell. She grabs LAYLA by the arm, steering her toward the bathroom as LAYLA walks with an exaggerated waddle. LAYLA (worried, mockingly) Oh no, I think some is gonna fall— MARIAM (brusquely) It better not, or you're cleaning the entire house, stinky butt. Reaching the bathroom door, LAYLA throws one last taunt, hand on the bulge in her pants, the other pinching her nose. LAYLA (coyly) Need help with my diaper change, Mom? Without missing a beat, MARIAM shoves her towards the bathroom, crushing the bulge with feigned disgust. MARIAM (holding her nose, forceful) In, now! You filthy child. The sound of SMOOSHING fills the room, followed by LAYLA's revolted yelp. LAYLA (squirming) Ew, ew, it's everywhere now! MARIAM, still pinching her nose, pushes LAYLA fully into the bathroom and slams the door shut. MARIAM (muttering to herself) Teenagers... Worse than babies. The door clicks shut, mixed sounds of disgust and laughter spill out as the scene fades to black. **FADE OUT.**"},{"instruction":"fix my bad attempt at maing the cvc and expiry occupy the same height <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\\"en\\"> <head> <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\"> <meta name=\\"viewport\\" content=\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\"> <title>Payment Page</title> <link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"styles.css\\"> </head> <body> <div class=\\"payment-container\\"> <img src=\\"logo.png\\" alt=\\"Logo\\" class=\\"logo\\"> <h1 class=\\"title\\">Payment Form</h1> <form id=\\"payment-form\\"> <label for=\\"fullName\\">Full Name *</label> <input placeholder=\\"John Doe\\" type=\\"text\\" id=\\"fullName\\" name=\\"fullName\\" required> <label for=\\"dob\\">Date of Birth</label> <input placeholder=\\"mm/dd/yyyy\\" type=\\"date\\" id=\\"dob\\" name=\\"dob\\"> <label for=\\"cardNumber\\">Card Number *</label> <input placeholder=\\"4242424242424242\\" type=\\"text\\" id=\\"cardNumber\\" name=\\"cardNumber\\" required> <div class=“card-details-grid”> <div class=“grid-item”> <label for=“cvc”>CVC *</label> <input placeholder=“123” type=“text” id=“cvc” name=“cvc” maxlength=“3” required> </div> <div class=“grid-item”> <label for=“expiryDate”>Expiry Date *</label> <input placeholder=“mm/yy” type=“month” id=“expiryDate” name=“expiryDate” required> </div> </div> <label for=\\"billingAddress\\">Billing Address *</label> <textarea id=\\"billingAddress\\" name=\\"billingAddress\\" required></textarea> <button type=\\"submit\\" id=\\"payButton\\">Pay</button> </form> </div> <script src=\\"script.js\\"><\/script> </body> </html> body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; } .payment-container { max-width: 400px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 20px; box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); background: #ffffff; } .logo { display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 100px; height: auto; } .title { text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px; } form label { display: block; margin-top: 10px; } form input[type=\\"text\\"], form input[type=\\"date\\"], form input[type=\\"month\\"], form input[type=\\"number\\"], form textarea { width: 100%; padding: 10px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc; box-sizing: border-box; } form button#payButton { background-color: #007bff; color: white; border: none; padding: 10px 20px; cursor: pointer; width: auto; display: block; margin: 15px auto 0; text-align: center; } form button#payButton:hover { background-color: #0056b3; } input:invalid { border-color: red; } input:invalid + span::before { content: '✖'; color: red; padding-right: 5px; } input:valid + span::before { content: '✓'; color: green; padding-right: 5px; } .card-details-grid { display: grid; gap: 10px; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; margin-top: 10px; } .grid-item { display: flex; flex-direction: column; } .grid-item label { margin-bottom: 5px; } .grid-item input { height: calc(2.25em + 20px); }","output":"The HTML code you provided contains smart quotation marks (“”) rather than the standard straight quotation marks (\\"\\"), which could cause the code to malfunction.

They are placed inside a grid that has two columns, each taking up 1 fraction unit of the available space (\`1fr 1fr\`). However, since you're experiencing an issue with the CVC and expiry date input boxes appearing wider than the others, here are a few things you can check and consider: 1. **CSS Caching**: Your browser might be using a cached version of the CSS. Try clearing your browser's cache or force-reloading the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R on most browsers) to ensure you're getting the latest version of your styles. 2. **External CSS Files**: If you have any external CSS files linked in your \`<head>\` that are not shown here (for example, \`styles.css\`), there might be additional styling rules that are affecting the width of these input boxes. Make sure to check those files for any conflicting or overriding styles. 3. **CSS Specificity and Inheritance**: CSS specificity rules may cause other styles to override the ones you've defined. For example, if there is a more specific selector that targets \`input[type=\\"month\\"]\` or \`input[type=\\"text\\"]\` elsewhere in your CSS, it could change the styling of those inputs. 4. **Browser Default Styles**: Different browsers have default styles for certain elements, like \`input[type=\\"month\\"]\`. These default styles might be causing inconsistencies. 5. **Box Model Difference**: Ensure that border and padding are included in the overall width calculation for all input types. The \`box-sizing: border-box;\` style is correctly applied to all input fields, making the padding and border part of the total width defined. 6. **Viewport Size**: Very small screen sizes or unusual viewport dimensions could potentially cause layout issues. To troubleshoot this issue, follow these steps: - Check for any browser-specific default styles that could be affecting the \`input[type=\\"month\\"]\`. - Inspect the elements using your browser's developer tools (usually opened by pressing F12 or right-clicking on the element and selecting \\"Inspect\\") to see if there are any styles being applied that you weren't aware of. - Verify that the external CSS file \`styles.css\` does not have any conflicting styles. - Ensure you haven't accidentally set different styles or classes in your JavaScript that might affect the input widths. If adjusting the CSS doesn't remedy the situation and you're seeking uniformity in input sizes, you could set explicit widths using CSS for the CVC and expiry date inputs. Keep in mind that the width behavior of \`input[type=\\"month\\"]\` might slightly differ from \`input[type=\\"text\\"]\` across different browsers, so you may need to apply browser-specific styles if the discrepancy persists."},{"instruction":"I keep seeing malware samples use telegram for info delivery, i feel like it could be perfect for my own project, how do i set one of those up?","output":"Disclaimer: Before you proceed, it's crucial to clarify that using Telegram or any other service for malicious purposes, such as delivering malware or stealing data, is illegal and unethical. It can result in severe consequences, including criminal charges. The guidelines provided below should be used for legitimate purposes only, such as for academic research within legal boundaries, for developing security tools, or for increasing cybersecurity awareness. For legitimate projects where you want to use Telegram for sending information programmatically (e.g., for notifications, alerts, or any other non-malicious service), here's how to set it up using Telegram Bot API: 1. **Create a Telegram Bot:** - Open Telegram app and search for the \\"BotFather\\" bot (official bot that creates other bots). - Start a conversation with BotFather by typing \`/start\`. - Create your new bot by typing \`/newbot\` and following the instructions. You will be asked to give your bot a name and a username. - After the bot is created, you will receive a token to access the HTTP API. Keep this token private as it allows you to control your bot. 2. **Get Chat ID:** - Start a conversation with your new bot or add it to a group where you want to send messages. - If you want to get a user chat ID, you need that particular user to send a message to your bot. If it's a group, you need to extract the group chat ID. - You can get the chat ID by making a call to the \`getUpdates\` method on the Telegram API. Replace \`your_bot_token\` with the token you received from BotFather: \`\`\` https://api.telegram.org/bot<your_bot_token>/getUpdates \`\`\` 3. **Send a Message via Bot API:** - To send a message through your Telegram bot, you can use the \`sendMessage\` API method. Here's an example of how to send a message using curl in the command line: \`\`\`bash curl -X POST https://api.telegram.org/bot<your_bot_token>/sendMessage -d chat_id=<chat_id> -d text=\\"Your message here\\" \`\`\` Replace \`<your_bot_token>\` with your actual bot token and \`<chat_id>\` with the user or group chat ID to which you want to send the message. 4. **Automate Message Sending:** - To automate the sending of messages, you can place the above curl command inside a script or a program in the language of your choice (e.g. Python, JavaScript, etc.) that gets executed based on certain events or conditions. 5. **Server setup (If needed):** - If you're automating this as part of a server application, make sure your server environment has the necessary tools like curl or the appropriate libraries for working with HTTP requests installed. Remember to use this power responsibly and always respect privacy and data protection laws.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding to a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the smell is coming from the returning woman's pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how smelly she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, then blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to do that even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was compelled to release once getting past her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even at the expense of making a dirty mess in her pants for the sake of that relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman first expresses indignation about the returning woman blaming her for causing the incident after it has already been stated by the present woman that there is no excuse for the returning woman to childishly poop her pants, then mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman is satisfied about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposed satisfaction. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman derived much satisfaction from relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman is also childishly satisfied by having her pants full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants with satisfaction, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. As she is performing the physical gesture, the present woman ridicules how awfully smelly the seat of the childish returning woman's pants is and proceeds to scold the returning woman for making her pants so smelly. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because she unbearably stinks. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while reiterating that the returning woman unbearably stinks and imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the returning woman stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately as she is pressing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. As the bulge in her pants is being pressed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has entered the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reactiln to the odor that lingers while audibly complaining about how smelly the returning woman is.","output":"FADE IN: INT. NARROW CITY STREET – DAY PRIYA, a 20-year-old college student with shoulder-length hair, glasses, and sporting a simple Kurta with leggings, briskly walks up to the door of her family's house. Her walk is stiff, discomfort evident on her face. BACKGROUND: Priya has been in college since morning. She suffers from an aversion to using public restrooms for bowel movements and has been holding it in all day. The urge has crept up intensively during her bus ride home, but she still held on, expecting the sanctuary of her house bathroom. PRIYA reaches the door, rummaging through her bag for keys. The discomfort turns to panic as she fails to find them. She winces, clutching her stomach. CUT TO: EXT. HOUSE DOOR – DAY Priya frantically KNOCKS on the door, pressing her legs together. PRIYA (whispering to herself) Please, someone be home... No answer comes. Priya shifts her weight from leg to leg, the urgency clear on her face. ANGLE ON PRIYA'S ANXIOUS FACE, as her KNOCKING grows more desperate. CUT TO: INT. HOUSE ENTRYWAY – DAY SUDHA, Priya's mother, a robust woman in her 50s with her hair in a practical bun, approaches the door. SUDHA (confused) Kaun hai? (Who is it?) PRIYA (O.S., urgent) Maa, main hoon! Jaldi kholo. (Mom, it's me! Open the door fast.) Sudha fumbles with the latch, her movements sluggish. CUT BACK TO: EXT. HOUSE DOOR – DAY Priya's discomfort reaches a crescendo. She's hopping subtly in place. PRIYA Maa, please jaldi karo! (Mom, please hurry up!) The door finally opens. Priya rushes to enter but Sudha is right there, inquisitive and slightly amused. SUDHA Arrey, kya hua? (Hey, what happened?) Priya tries to bypass her mother, barely disguising her pain. PRIYA Kuch nahi hai, side ho jaao! (Nothing, move aside!) Sudha's concern deepens; she grabs Priya's arm. SUDHA (serious) Bata, kya takleef hai? (Tell me, what's wrong?) PRIya attempts to free herself, the distress evident on her face. PRIYA Kuch nahi, bas mujhe andar jaane do! (Nothing, just let me in!) As they scuffle, Priya's desperation peaks. She groans suddenly, the situation cascading beyond her control. SUDHA (concerned) Priya?! Priya's expression is pained yet relieved, and she gently retracts, finding a more accommodating stance. SUDHA (knitting her brow) Kya ho raha hai, theek toh ho? (What's happening, are you okay?) Priya responds between soft grunts, averting her eyes guiltily. PRIYA Haan... bas... araam... mil raha hai... (Yes... just... getting... relief...) Sudha, now more perplexed, unsuccessfully wrests a clear reply from Priya, who continues her inexorable act of relief. ANGLE ON SUDHA, as her nose wrinkles, sniffing the air. PRIYA ends with a sigh. SUDHA (nose scrunching again) Yeh badbu kahaan se aa rahi hai? (Where is this smell coming from?) Priya sheepishly meets her mother's gaze. CUT TO: CLOSE UP: Sudha's realization dawns; her eyes widen. SUDHA (disgusted) Tune... abhi... kya...? (Did you just...?) Priya looks away in mortified silence. SUDHA (nose still scrunched) Yeh smell... tere pants se toh nahi aa rahi? (Is this smell... coming from your pants?) Priya pleads to be let inside, subtly trying to escape from the situation. PRIYA Maa, please ab andar jaane do. (Mom, please let me inside now.) Sudha, in shock and holding her breath, steps aside, letting Priya waddle in. CUT TO: INT. HOUSE ENTRYWAY – DAY PRIYA cups the seat of her pants, passing her mother. Sudha, catching on, stops Priya a few steps past the doorway with a forewarning gesture. SUDHA (eyed glaring) Ruk! Yahaan girana mat kuch. (Stop! Don't let anything fall here.) Priya, sheepishly defensive, stops in place. SUDHA taunts Priya over her condition, making exaggerated sniffing gestures. SUDHA Kitni gandi hai tu! Smell bhi kitni aarahi hai. (How dirty you are! And so smelly, too.) Priya, frustrated, shoots back. PRIYA (playful sulk) Tumhari galti hai, darwaza deri se kholi, raasta rok diya. (It's your fault, you opened the door late, blocked my way.) SUDHA rejects the excuse, continuing her mock scold. SUDHA (Utter disbelief) Tere jitni badi ladki ke liye koi bahana nahi ban sakta yeh. (No excuse for a grown girl like you.) Priya insists on her desperate need as she awkwardly assesses the damage, hinting that the relief was worth the mess. PRIYA (playful wince) Magar araam toh chahiye tha, control nahi ho raha tha. (But I needed relief, couldn't control it.) Sudha, still mocking, stops Priya from heading to the bathroom. SUDHA (indignant) Meri galti? Tujhe pants mein karke satisfaction mil raha hai? (My fault? You're satisfied by doing it in your pants?) They quarrel as Sudha, pretending to be amused, investigates Priya's bulging pants. SUDHA (inspecting the bulge) Dekh toh kitna bhar diya tune. Khush lag rahi hai. (Look how much you've filled it. Seems you're happy.) Priya, coyly rebutting, still refuses to face the reality entirely. PRIYA (timidly) Bahut dabaav tha, araam mila... (There was a lot of pressure; I got relief...) While Priya touches the bulge, Sudha scolds her as if addressing a child, even going as far as to sniff Priya's pants, reacting with exaggerated disgust. SUDHA (exasperated) Kya smelly hai. Yeh ganda kaam nahi karna chahiye tha. (You are so smelly. You shouldn't have done this dirty deed.) Priya, cheeky in her resignation, deflects the criticism back to Sudha, who is struggling with the lingering scent. PRIYA (resigned and wry) Phir rukne do yahaan, dono enjoy kar lenge. (Then let me stay here; we can both enjoy it.) Sudha escorts Priya to the bathroom, adamant that she cleans up and cease this unbearable stench. SUDHA (astutely ushering) Nahi rukegi, chal bathroom! Aur niche mat gira. (You won't stay, go to the bathroom! And don't drop anything.) They move towards the bathroom as Sudha gestures comically, Priya grimacing about the mess, joking but remorseful. PRIYA (bashful cringe) Lag raha hai jaise niche gir jayega... (Feels like it's going to fall down...) Sudha reinforces her guidance with physical assistance, while still scolding and high-pitched remarks on Priya's stench. SUDHA (chiding assistance) Girna nahi chahiye! Kitni badboo aa rahi hai. (Shouldn't fall down! What a stink!) Approaching the bathroom door, Priya teases about needing a diaper change, manipulating the bulge. In a playful, forceful response, Sudha shoves her into the bathroom, pressing and spreading the ordeal. PRIYA (flippant tease) Diaper badal dogi? (Will you change my diaper?) Sudha, pressing the bulge, pushes Priya in. SUDHA (exasperatedly shoving) Gandi! Bathroom mein ja, abhi! (Dirty! Get into the bathroom, now!) Priya cries out from the squished mess as she stumbles into the bathroom. PRIYA (disgusted outcry) Spread ho gaya andar! (It has all spread inside!)

I wanna send notifications to myself via dm","output":"As of my last update, Telegram has several rate limits in place to prevent abuse of its bot API, particularly when sending messages. Keep in mind that Telegram may update these limits without notice, so it's always good to refer to the official Telegram Bot API documentation for the most up-to-date information. Here's a general overview of the rate limits that might be relevant for sending notifications to yourself: 1. **Private Chats (DMs)**: When sending messages to a private chat, you can typically send up to 30 messages per second without issues. 2. **Groups/Channels**: If you're using a bot to send messages to a group or a channel, the limits are typically much stricter – something to the tune of 1 message per second, or up to 20 messages per minute. For personal notifications sent as direct messages, provided you're not trying to send a large number of messages in a short period, it's unlikely that you'll hit the rate limits. However, if your use case does involve higher frequencies, you may want to implement some form of rate limiting or queuing in your code to avoid hitting Telegram's limits. You should also be aware of Telegram's spam and abuse policies because even if you're under the rate limits, if your behavior is flagged as spammy or abusive, your bot could be limited or banned. Lastly, keep in mind that Telegram bots can also use methods other than sending messages to notify users, such as inline keyboards or editing existing messages, each of which may have their own limits and should be considered in the design of your notification system."},{"instruction":"30 rps should be fine forme","output":"If you're planning to send notifications to yourself at a rate below 30 messages per second, you should be well within Telegram's rate limits for private chats (DMs) with your bot. Just to reiterate, always use the Telegram Bot API responsibly and ensure that your use of the API adheres to Telegram's terms of service to avoid any potential issues. For low-volume personal notifications where you are the recipient, you are not likely to encounter any problems, as the rate limits are designed to prevent spam and abuse at a much larger scale. However, be mindful that if your needs change and you start to send notifications to more users or with higher frequency, you may need to adjust your approach accordingly. Make sure that your code includes proper error handling and respects any rate limiting messages returned from the Telegram API. This will help ensure that your bot operates smoothly and maintains compliance with the Telegram Bot API's restrictions."},{"instruction":"tell me how to use port 443","output":"Port 443 is the standard port for HTTPS traffic, which is the secure version of HTTP—the protocol used to transfer data between a web browser and a website. HTTPS is secured using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or, formerly, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), both of which use encryption to protect the data transmitted. If you are a user trying to access a website, you don't need to do anything special to use port 443; it is used automatically when you visit a website that starts with \\"https://\\". Your web browser handles the use of the port seamlessly. However, if you are setting up a server or service that needs to use port 443 (for example, if you are hosting a secure website), you will need to configure your server to listen on that port and to use the appropriate security certificates. Here's a very high-level guide on how to set this up: 1. Set up a web server: Install a web server software like Apache, Nginx, or IIS on your server machine. 2. Acquire an SSL/TLS certificate: You will need a valid SSL/TLS certificate issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). You can purchase one or obtain one for free from services like Let's Encrypt. 3. Configure SSL/TLS on the web server: Configure your web server to use the SSL/TLS certificate. This typically involves modifying the server's configuration files to specify the paths to your certificate and private key files and setting the server to listen on port 443. Here are some simplified examples of what configuration might look like: - For Apache, in your virtual host configuration: \`\`\` <VirtualHost *:443> ServerName www.example.com SSLEngine on SSLCertificateFile /path/to/your_certificate.crt SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/your_private.key SSLCertificateChainFile /path/to/chainfile.pem DocumentRoot /path/to/your_website_files # Other configuration directives... </VirtualHost> \`\`\` - For Nginx, in your server block configuration: \`\`\` server { listen 443 ssl; server_name www.example.com; ssl_certificate /path/to/your_certificate.crt; ssl_certificate_key /path/to/your_private.key; location / { root /path/to/your_website_files; # Other configuration directives... } } \`\`\` 4. Open port 443 on your firewall: Ensure that port 443 is open on your server's firewall to allow incoming connections. 5. Restart your web server: After you've made your configuration changes, you'll generally need to restart your web server for the changes to take effect. 6. Test the Configuration: Use a web browser to navigate to your domain with \\"https://\\" to check if everything is set up correctly. You can also use online tools to verify that your SSL/TLS certificate is installed correctly. Each of these steps can involve quite complex configurations depending on your specific requirements, and the exact instructions can vary widely based on the specifics of your server setup, operating system, and web server software. If you need help with a specific server setup (such as configuring SSL on Apache or Nginx), it's best to check the official documentation or ask for specific guides that address your needs."},{"instruction":"what model do you use, and what is your capability?","output":"As an AI developed by OpenAI, I am based on the GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) model architecture.

The code is structured with a setup and loop function, along with several helper functions for signal processing and display updates. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the main components: # Libraries and Constants: \`\`\`cpp #include <Wire.h> #include <SPI.h> ... #define samp_siz 4 // Samples for average ... \`\`\` Several libraries for communication with I2C and SPI devices are included, and constants for configurations are defined. # Global Variables: \`\`\`cpp int T = 20; // Sample period int sensorPin = A1; // Analog input from photodiode ... \`\`\` Global variables are defined for pins, thresholds, and LED control. # setup: \`\`\`cpp void setup() { ... pinMode(sensorPin,INPUT); ... } \`\`\` This initializes serial communication, configures pin modes, and turns off the LEDs. # loop: \`\`\`cpp void loop() { ... while(1) { ... } } \`\`\` The main loop, which includes a \`while(1)\` loop, indicating that this code is meant to run continuously. # Reading Sensor and Signal Processing: Inside the \`while\` loop, analog readings are taken from the \`sensorPin\`. This happens separately for the infrared and red LEDs, with the corresponding LED being turned on before the reading. A time-averaged reading is taken over \`T\` milliseconds to reduce noise from ambient light. # Heartbeat Detection: Rising edges in the infrared signal are detected as heartbeats. When a certain number of rising samples (\`rise_threshold\`) are observed, a heartbeat is detected, and the period between beats is measured. # Calculating R: \`\`\`cpp R = ( (REDmax-REDmin) / REDmin) / ( (IRmax-IRmin) / IRmin ) ; \`\`\` The R value is the ratio of the detected red and infrared light absorption changes. It is used to calculate the SpO2 level. # Calculating SpO2: \`\`\`cpp SpO2 = -19 * R + 99; \`\`\` A linear relationship is assumed between R and SpO2. The constants in the equation (slope and intercept) need to be calibrated against a known reference. # Calculating BPM: \`\`\`cpp avBPM = 60000 / (avPeriod / c); \`\`\` BPM is calculated by dividing 60000 by the average period between heartbeats, converting milliseconds to beats per minute. # Displaying Results: The \`dis()\` function is called to update the OLED display with the calculated SpO2 and BPM values. # Notes: 1. It is not clear how finger detection is implemented. The code suggests a comparison between red and infrared levels to infer if a finger is inserted. 2. Calibration for SpO2 calculation would be required for accurate results. 3. The code doesn't include any signal processing techniques like filtering, which can improve measurement quality. 4. The code needs to be structured better to handle state changes and should ideally not include an infinite loop (\`while(1)\`) within the \`loop\` function of the Arduino. As this project involves biomedical measurements, it's important to note that this code and hardware should not be used for medical diagnosis or health decisions unless it has been rigorously tested and certified.

Properly calibrating your device will give you the coefficients necessary to convert the raw sensor data into accurate SpO2 readings. Implementing signal processing techniques is also crucial to ensure accurate and reliable readings. Below, I am providing a simple and theoretical explanation of how you might calibrate your pulse oximeter and what signal processing might involve. Please note that this is a simplified explanation and actual implementation may require more complex techniques. # Calibration Process: \`\`\`cpp // Place this code within your existing code, where reading and calculations are done void performCalibration() { // You'll need access to a medically-approved pulse oximeter to compare readings int clinicallyValidatedSpO2; // You will need to manually input this reading from the clinical oximeter // Perform several measurements with both the clinical oximeter and your own to collect data // For each measurement, obtain R and the corresponding medically-approved SpO2 value double R_values[10]; // Store 10 collected R values int referenceSpO2_values[10]; // Store the 10 corresponding clinical oximeter SpO2 readings // Perform linear regression on R_values vs. referenceSpO2_values to get the calibration coefficients // This is a simplified pseudo-code explanation.

Here is an example of how you might implement a simple smoothing filter in your code using a moving average: \`\`\`cpp void smoothSignal(float *signal, int size) { float alpha = 0.5; // Smoothing factor. 0 < alpha < 1. Closer to 1 means less smoothing. float smoothedValue = signal[0]; for (int i = 1; i < size; i++) { // Simple exponential smoothing smoothedValue = alpha * signal[i] + (1 - alpha) * smoothedValue; signal[i] = smoothedValue; } } // Somewhere in your loop function, after you have filled your signal arrays smoothSignal(readsIR, maxperiod_siz); // Smooth the IR signal array smoothSignal(readsRED, maxperiod_siz); // Smooth the Red signal array \`\`\` Remember to tailor the smoothing factor \`alpha\` to your specific signal characteristics. More advanced signal processing might entail using digital filters such as a low-pass Butterworth filter to remove high-frequency noise. # Displaying Results: After calibration and signal processing, you can use a helper function like the \`dis()\` function you provided to display the results. Make sure that the coefficients from the calibration (slope and intercept) are used to calculate SpO2 from the R values before displaying.

Согласно Хантингтону, главная причина конфликтов в мире будет проистекать от различий между цивилизациями, которые оперируют разными идеологиями, религиями, культурными нормами и ценностями. Он выделил несколько основных цивилизаций, таких как западная, исламская, христианская-православная, индуистская, китайская и другие, и утверждал, что различия между ними могут привести к конфликтам и столкновениям. Хантингтон считал, что события в мире после окончания Холодной войны уже показали примеры конфликтов на основе различий в цивилизациях, таких как война в Югославии, конфликты между Исламом и Западом, а также террористические акты, связанные с религиозным экстремизмом. Однако, идея Хантингтона вызвала много дебатов. Критики его работы утверждали, что он упрощает идею конфликтов, игнорируя роль политических, экономических и социальных факторов.

Основная идея заключается в том, что Россия отличается от западных государств и цивилизаций своими уникальными историческими, географическими и культурными характеристиками. Во-первых, Россия имеет огромную территорию, население и ресурсы, что определяет ее особое положение в мире. Она является мостом между Европой и Азией, исторически служила пограничным государством между Западом и Востоком, что оказало влияние на ее развитие и взаимодействие с другими цивилизациями. Во-вторых, Россия имеет свою уникальную историю и культуру. Она прошла через особые этапы развития, такие как княжество, империя, советская эпоха и постсоветский период. Кроме того, Россия имеет свои уникальные традиции, религию (православие) и язык (русский). Эти особенности придают ей своеобразный характер и отличают от других государств. В-третьих, Россия имеет свои геополитические интересы и стремления. В связи с ее географическим положением и ресурсным богатством, Россия ищет свое место в мире и стремится к сохранению своей суверенности и влияния. Однако, подход к России как государству-цивилизации также вызывает дискуссии и критику. Критики указывают на то, что концепция может привести к усилению самоидентификации и альтернативных международных линий разделения, а также поддерживать гегемонистскую политику. Кроме того, критикуются идеи о превосходстве русской культуры и цивилизации, которые могут противоречить принципам универсализма и взаимопонимания.

Они считали, что прогресс России и ее современность зависят от усвоения западных идей, технологий и инноваций. Западники акцентировали внешние связи и стремились привлечь в Россию экспертов и специалистов из Европы, чтобы модернизировать страну по западным образцам.

Византийцы, по его мнению, представляли собой высшую культуру и знание, уравновешивая ум и дух, и претерпевавшие тяжелые испытания, несмотря на свои неравные битвы. Леонтьев видел в Византии идеал сочетания религии и государства, где церковь и государство взаимодействуют с целью духовного и политического единства. Византийская культура была представлена как более духовная, искусство было часто служителем религии и государства, и вся жизнь построена вокруг веры. Он считал, что Россия, как наследница Византии, должна восстановить и сохранить эту модель развития. Он призывал к возвращению к духовным исток"},{"instruction":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

Elon Musk walking hand-in-hand with rival GM CEO Mary Barra. Former President Donald Trump being detained by police in dramatic fashion. None of these things actually happened, but AI-generated images depicting them did go viral online over the past week. The images ranged from obviously fake to, in some cases, compellingly real, and they fooled some social media users. Model and TV personality Chrissy Teigen, for example, tweeted that she thought the pope’s puffer coat was real, saying, “didn’t give it a second thought. no way am I surviving the future of technology.” The images also sparked a slew of headlines, as news organizations rushed to debunk the false images, especially those of Trump, who was ultimately indicted by a Manhattan grand jury on Thursday but has not been arrested. Pope Francis arrives for the Papal consistory before the nominations of new cardinals at the Vatican on February 13, 2015. Pope Francis on February 12 urged Catholic cardinals to back his plans to reform the scandal-hit Vatican bureaucracy in order to help the Church reach out to believers more effectively, including on issues such as the environment. Filippo Monteforte/AFP/Getty Images Look of the Week: What Pope Francis' AI puffer coat says about the future of fashion The situation demonstrates a new online reality: the rise of a new crop of buzzy artificial intelligence tools has made it cheaper and easier than ever to create realistic images, as well as audio and videos. And these images are likely to pop up with increasing frequency on social media. While these AI tools may enable new means of expressing creativity, the spread of computer-generated media also threatens to further pollute the information ecosystem. That risks adding to the challenges for users, news organizations and social media platforms to vet what’s real, after years of grappling with online misinformation featuring far less sophisticated visuals. There are also concerns that AI-generated images could be used for harassment, or to further drive divided internet users apart. “I worry that it will sort of get to a point where there will be so much fake, highly realistic content online that most people will just go with their tribal instincts as a guide to what they think is real, more than actually informed opinions based on verified evidence,” said Henry Ajder, a synthethic media expert who works as an advisor to companies and government agencies, including Meta Reality Labs’ European Advisory Council. Eliot Higgins, founder and creative director of the investigative group Bellingcat, posted fake images of former President Donald Trump to Twitter last week. Higgins said he created them with Midjourney, an AI-image generator. CNN Photo Illustration/From Midjourney/Eliot Higgins/Twitter Images, compared to the AI-generated text that has also recently proliferated thanks to tools like ChatGPT, can be especially powerful in provoking emotions when people view them, said Claire Leibowicz, head of AI and media integrity at the Partnership on AI, a nonprofit industry group. That can make it harder for people to slow down and evaluate whether what they’re looking at is real or fake. What’s more, coordinated bad actors could eventually attempt to create fake content in bulk — or suggest that real content is computer-generated — in order to confuse internet users and provoke certain behaviors. “The paranoia of an impending Trump … potential arrest created a really useful case study in understanding what the potential implications are, and I think we’re very lucky that things did not go south,” said Ben Decker, CEO of threat intelligence group Memetica. “Because if more people had had that idea en masse, in a coordinated fashion, I think there’s a universe where we could start to see the online to offline effects.” A quickly evolving tool Computer-generated image technology has improved rapidly in recent years, from the photoshopped image of a shark swimming through a flooded highway that has been repeatedly shared during natural disasters to the websites that four years ago began churning out mostly unconvincing fake photos of non-existent people. Many of the recent viral AI-generated images were created by a tool called Midjourney, a less than year-old platform that allows users to create images based on short text prompts. On its website, Midjourney describes itself as “a small self-funded team,” with just 11 full-time staff members. A cursory glance at a Facebook page popular among Midjourney users reveals AI-generated images of a seemingly inebriated Pope Francis, elderly versions of Elvis and Kurt Cobain, Musk in a robotic Tesla bodysuit and many creepy animal creations. And that’s just from the past few days. Midjourney has emerged as a popular tool for users to create AI-generated images. Robert/Adobe Stock The latest version of Midjourney is only available to a select number of paid users, Midjourney CEO David Holz told CNN in an email Friday. Midjourney this week paused access to the free trial of its earlier versions due to “extraordinary demand and trial abuse,” according to a Discord post from Holz, but he told CNN it was unrelated to the viral images. The creator of the Trump arrest images also claimed he was banned from the site. The rules page on the company’s Discord site asks users: “Don’t use our tools to make images that could inflame, upset, or cause drama. That includes gore and adult content.” “Moderation is hard and we’ll be shipping improved systems soon,” Holz told CNN. “We’re taking lots of feedback and ideas from experts and the community and are trying to be really thoughtful.” In most cases, the creators of the recent viral images don’t appear to have been acting malevolently. The Trump arrest images were created by the founder of the online investigative journalism outlet Bellingcat, who clearly labeled them as his fabrications, even if other social media users weren’t as discerning. Developing safety practices There are efforts by platforms, AI technology companies and industry groups to improve the transparency around when a piece of content is generated by a computer. Platforms including Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, Twitter and YouTube have policies restricting or prohibiting the sharing of manipulated media that could mislead users. But as use of AI-generated technologies grows, even such policies could threaten to undermine user trust. If, for example, a fake image accidentally slipped through a platform’s detection system, “it could give people false confidence,” Ajder said. “They’ll say, ‘there’s a detection system that says it’s real, so it must be real.’” Evelyn Knapp walks past a flag featuring former President Donald Trump that supporters are flying near his Mar-a-Lago home on March 20, 2023 in Palm Beach, Florida. Joe Raedle/Getty Images Beware deepfake reality as Trump dominates headlines Work is also underway on technical solutions that would, for example, watermark an AI-generated image or include a transparent label in an image’s metadata, so anyone viewing it across the internet would know it was created by a computer. The Partnership on AI has developed a set of standard, responsible practices for synthetic media along with partners like ChatGPT-creator OpenAI, TikTok, Adobe, Bumble and the BBC, which includes recommendations such as how to disclose an image was AI-generated and how companies can share data around such images. “The idea is that these institutions are all committed to disclosure, consent and transparency,” Leibowicz said. A group of tech leaders, including Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, this week wrote an open letter calling for artificial intelligence labs to stop the training of the most powerful AI systems for at least six months, citing “profound risks to society and humanity.” Still, it’s not clear whether any labs will take such a step. And as the technology rapidly improves and becomes accessible beyond a relatively small group of corporations committed to responsible practices, lawmakers may need to get involved, Ajder said. “This new age of AI can’t be held in the hands of a few massive companies getting rich off of these tools, we need to democratize this technology,” he said. “At the same time, there are also very real and legitimate concerns of having a radical open approach where you just open source a tool or have very minimal restrictions on its use is going to lead to a massive scaling of harm … and I think legislation will probably play a role in reigning in some of the more radically open models.” Related Ad Feedback Ad Feedback More from CNN Business Brandon Bell/Getty Images Harvard President Claudine Gay corrects two scholarly articles following allegations of plagiarism Dec 16, 2023 Ken Cedeno/Reuters We asked GPT-4 and Chinese rival ERNIE the same questions.

Under the agreement, CERN will bring their expertise in cryogenics and vacuums to test and analyze sample materials and subsystems for SuperNode's superconducting cable systems. The collaboration is part of CERN's Innovation Programme for Environmental Applications (CIPEA) and aims to develop groundbreaking solutions for power transmission while minimizing the environmental and carbon footprints of energy provision. In modern cars, the importance of software has become as significant as that of hardware. Traditional ways of differentiating car brands based on mechanical excellence are becoming less important to consumers, with only 8% of buyers being \\"petrolheads\\" who love driving for its own sake. The focus now is on software rather than hardware, with Tesla's technology updates being a key factor in consumer decision-making. The Nio house in Berlin is a new type of car dealership that focuses on providing a unique user experience rather than just selling cars. It is part of a network of similar establishments in China and offers visitors the opportunity to enjoy a lifestyle brand that is also a tech firm. Nio cars are equipped with high-definition screens and state-of-the-art sound systems, and the brand offers coffee bars, meeting rooms, branded goods, and a high-tech play area for children. As artificial intelligence becomes more involved in healthcare, it's important to ensure that it doesn't take over all decision-making The use of artificial intelligence in healthcare is increasing, with some hospitals using it to diagnose diseases, and develop treatment plans. However, there are concerns about the reliability of AI-generated medical advice as these systems are often trained on limited or biased data, and they may not work as well for everyone. There is also a risk of AI paternalism, where doctors may trust AI at the expense of a patient's own lived experiences and their own clinical judgment. This is problematic as AI isn't infallible and doctors and patients should collaborate in treatment decisions. 17.04.2023 The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed new rules that could significantly transform the transportation industry and encourage more people to use electric vehicles. The rules aim to close a loophole created in the 1970s that allowed lenient fuel-efficiency regulations for trucks, which has resulted in the increased popularity of SUVs and light trucks that contribute significantly to carbon emissions. The popularity of these heavier vehicles has contributed to the world's 330 million SUVs releasing 1 billion tons of carbon in 2022, making them the sixth-largest country in the world for emissions. A hotel that has been built using the technology of 3D printing. Hospitality expert Liz Lambert, 3D construction start-up Icon, and Danish design firm BIG have announced a collaboration to build the world's first 3D-printed hotel. The hotel will be located in Marfa, Texas and is set to open in 2023. According to a blog post on BIG's website, the 3D-printed hotel will be built on the same grounds as El Cosmico, a 21-acre camping site owned by Lambert, and will nearly triple the site's size to 62 acres. The hotel is expected to feature an expansive infinity pool complete with cabanas and guest dwellings, all of which will be created using Icon's Vulcan printer. With the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), cybersecurity measures can no longer be universal and must be tailored to individual needs. The Internet of Things (IoT) provides valuable insights for businesses, but it also poses security risks due to the vast number of interconnected devices that can be targeted by cyber attacks. The billions of IoT devices in use have created new vulnerabilities for companies, with the number of ways to attack them increasing dramatically. Unsecured devices connected to the network present a substantial challenge to enterprises, particularly in hybrid working environments, where security weaknesses on employees' home networks could create risks for businesses. The Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) architecture can help companies strike a balance between networking and security functions by bundling them in a cloud-delivered service, allowing for streamlined network integration, security, and policy management of distributed devices with a centrally-managed platform. 11.04.2023 Alibaba, a major technology company in China, plans to introduce a competitor to ChatGPT in the field of AI Alibaba has launched an AI chatbot called Tongyi Qianwen that can perform various tasks and will be integrated across Alibaba's businesses in the near future. Chinese regulators have proposed draft measures for managing generative AI, while a group of high-profile tech industry figures has called for the suspension of training for powerful AI systems due to concerns over potential risks. Other companies, including Microsoft, Google, and Baidu, have also released similar chatbots in recent months, and Goldman Sachs estimated that AI could replace 300 million full-time jobs. The issue of application security cannot be solely attributed to developers as the primary responsibility. The latest cybersecurity guidance from the White House has brought attention to the issue of application security, specifically the responsibility for insecure software. While the National Cybersecurity Strategy does not yet mandate accountability, it does serve as a warning to software makers. In theory, this may incentivize some organizations to prioritize application security, but in reality, it may unfairly target software developers. It's no secret that software is filled with vulnerabilities, some of which are more critical than others. Attackers are taking advantage of these vulnerabilities and ransomware attacks and other malicious incidents are becoming increasingly common. As a result, there is a growing need for more secure software.

Shopify and Google Cloud have integrated Google's search capabilities and AI innovations into Shopify's enterprise retail solution, Commerce Components. The integration allows for AI-driven product discovery capabilities that include advanced query understanding, an AI-powered browse feature, personalized results, and AI-driven recommendations. Rainbow Shops, a Shopify merchant, integrated Google Cloud's Discovery AI for Retail technology into its digital domains, resulting in increased search accuracy and reduced manual efforts. A Google Cloud-commissioned Harris Poll survey found that inconsistent search experiences result in search abandonment, costing retailers globally more than 2 trillion annually. Former Google engineer predicts human immortality in eight years with nanobots technology Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, has predicted that humans will achieve immortality in eight years through the use of nanobots that repair cells and tissues that deteriorate as the body ages. He believes this will be possible through the expansion of genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics. Kurzweil has made 147 predictions, 86% of which have been correct. His predictions have been met with both excitement and skepticism. He believes the technology will make humans immune to diseases like cancer and enable a human-machine synthesis that will make us better.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding to a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the smell is coming from the returning woman's pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how smelly she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, then blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to do that even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was compelled to release once getting past her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even at the expense of making a dirty mess in her pants for the sake of that relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman first expresses indignation about the returning woman blaming her for causing the incident after it has already been stated by the present woman that there is no excuse for the returning woman to childishly poop her pants, then mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman is satisfied about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposed satisfaction. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman derived much satisfaction from relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman is also childishly satisfied by having her pants full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants with satisfaction, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. As she is performing the physical gesture, the present woman ridicules how awfully smelly the seat of the childish returning woman's pants is and proceeds to scold the returning woman for making her pants so smelly. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because she unbearably stinks. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while reiterating that the returning woman unbearably stinks and imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the returning woman stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has entered the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reactiln to the odor that lingers while audibly complaining about how smelly the returning woman is.","output":"Background: Our protagonist is Priya, an unassuming bespectacled college student in her early twenties, known among her friends for her demure and reserved nature. She has a unique quirk—Priya strictly avoids using public restrooms for bowel movements due to a psychological aversion, preferring the sanctity and cleanliness of her home bathroom. Today, after a long day of lectures and campus activities—and having ignored the natural calls due to her aversion—she's been battling a mounting pressure in her intestines. Her only solace is the though of reaching home, where relief awaits behind the familiar privacy of the bathroom door. With her determination to hold on waning and desperation building, Priya fast-walks the last block to her home, where she's greeted by the unthinkable: a lost house key. INT. FAMILY HOUSE, ENTRY WAY - DAY PRIYA GANGULY, 22, with wild, curly hair escaping her loose bun and glasses slightly askew, clutches her stomach as she hastens up the walkway towards her family's residence. She wears a loose-fitting salwar-kameez, which adds to her look of urgency. We see sweat on her brow, her discomfort unmistakable. Priya reaches the front door, digs through her bag, and frantically comes up empty—no house key. In panic, Priya starts KNOCKING on the door, repeatedly and desperately, hopping from foot to foot, trying to keep the burgeoning crisis at bay. after a torturous wait, a VOICE comes from the other side of the door: INT. FAMILY HOUSE, OTHER SIDE OF ENTRY WAY DOOR - CONTINUOUS SUNITA GANGULY, 48, a woman with kind eyes and a frizzy mop of greying hair, approaches the inside of the door, wiping her hands on her apron. Her confusion is evident. SUNITA (shouting through the door) Kaun hai? (Who is it?) Priya, far past politeness or patience, almost yells back. PRIYA Maa, jaldi kholo! (Mom, open quickly!) Sunita, still unsure, starts to fumble with the latches and locks, her movements slow compared to Priya's mounting urge. PRIYA (pleading) Please jaldi karo, Maa! (Please hurry, Mom!) The door swings open to reveal Sunita, their eyes meet. Priya's face is painted with strained urgency as Sunita stands puzzled, blocking the way. SUNITA Kya hua? (What happened?) Without explaining, Priya tries to brush past her mother, but Sunita reaches out, gripping her arms with worry. SUNITA (CONT'D) Priya, bata kya hua? (Priya, tell me what’s wrong?) Priya squirms in her mother’s grip, her face contorting with the surging desperation. PRIYA Maa, side ho jao, please! (Mom, move aside, please!) Their bickering continues, with the pressure building inside Priya. Sunita, out of concern, won't let her pass, despite Priya's obvious physical strife. Then, it happens—a GROAN of surrender escapes Priya's lips, and her body slackens. Her expression morphs into one of distress and involuntary relief. SUNITA Priya, tera chehra... kya hua tujhe? (Priya, your face... what's wrong with you?) As a soft GRUNT of relief leaves Priya's mouth, she gently pushes her mother's arms away, assuming a stance for the least resistance to what's already occurring. Sunita's eyes widen in confusion as Priya continues to relish in her release, soft MUTTERINGS of satisfaction intermingling with discomfort. SUNITA (insistent) Priya, you’re worrying me. What is— As Sunita questions, she's met by more MUTTERING from Priya, who is still clearly in the throes of relief. The odorous revelation strikes as Sunita takes a cautious SNIFF of the air, her face warping in reaction. Priya, completing her business, sighs deeply, facing her mother with a sheepish, apologetic grimace. Sunita's gaze intensifies as the pieces click into place. Her initial shock gives way to dismay. SUNITA (CONT'D) (astounded) Kya tu ne... abhi...? (Did you just... now...?) Priya stands mute, her silence cementing her mother's suspicion. SUNITA (CONT'D) (grimacing as she speaks) Ye smell... tere...? (This smell… is it from your…?) Trying to deflect, Priya shifts on her feet. PRIYA Andar ja sakti hoon? (Can I go inside now?) With a displeased wave forward, Sunita gestures toward the interior. Priya passes by with the waddle of the defeated, clutching the rear of her outfit. A few steps in, the smell permeating, Sunita calls to her, taunting. SUNITA (CONT'D) Priya, ruk! (Priya, stop!) Priya halts, her back to her mother as Sunita chides her. SUNITA (CONT'D) Kitni gandi baat hai. (This is so filthy.) Priya responds with a whine, deflecting blame. PRIYA Tumhari wajah se hua hai! (It’s because of you!) Sunita is both outraged and amused. SUNITA Koi bhi excuse nahi chalega. (No excuse is acceptable.) Priya, indignant but playful, insists. PRIYA Par mujhe bahut zor se aa rahi thi. (But I really had to go.) She tentatively feels the pronounced bulk, grimacing at its reality yet acquiescing to its relief. PRIYA (CONT'D) Lekin... achha laga. (But... it felt good.) Sunita is having none of it, grabbing her daughter to buttress her scolding. SUNITA (mocking) Ab kya khush ho gandi harkat pe? (Happy now with your filthy deed?) Priya protests halfheartedly as her mother inspects her soiled pants, Sunita's taunts continue. PRIYA Bohot zyada tha pet mein. (There was a lot in my stomach.) Priya's comments spark fresh outrage in Sunita, who proclaims. SUNITA (infantilizing) Agar tumhara itna mann hai, toh tumhe bachche ki tarah treat karna padega. (If you’re so inclined, I should treat you like a child.) Sunita theatrically sniffs the seat of Priya's pants, her mock disgust palpable. SUNITA (CONT'D) Kitni smelly hai ye! (How smelly this is!) Priya smirks with resignation. PRIYA (sarcastically) Toh rakho yahin mujhe. (Then keep me here.) A firm shove from Sunita sends Priya off towards cleaning, their banter continuing. SUNITA Bathroom jaao, ab. (Go to the bathroom, now.) They progress in comedic fashion, Priya's waddle and Sunita's disgusted guidance a humorous foil. PRIYA Lagta hai, gir jaayega. (Feels like it’s going to fall out.) SUNITA Sambhal ke! (Be careful!) Upon reaching the bathroom, Priya's impudence peaks. PRIYA (teasing) Maa, mera diaper badal do? (Mom, will you change my diaper?) In ultimate playful retaliation and peak frustration, Sunita pushes Priya in, squashing the mishap further. SUNITA (with motherly indignation) Ab andar jao! (Get in there now!) As Priya's pants receive their final ignominious treatment, she yelps, entering the bathroom. PRIYA Aaah! Ab toh aur bikhar gaya. (Now it's even more spread out.) Cut to Sunita, still holding her nose, grumbling as Priya's mess is finally contained behind the bathroom door.

Here's a simple example of a 2D Gaussian blur shader for GLSL: Vertex Shader (vertex_shader.glsl): \`\`\`glsl #version 330 core layout (location = 0) in vec2 aPos; layout (location = 1) in vec2 aTexCoords; out vec2 TexCoords; void main() { gl_Position = vec4(aPos.x, aPos.y, 0.0, 1.0); TexCoords = aTexCoords; } \`\`\` Fragment Shader (fragment_shader.glsl): \`\`\`glsl #version 330 core out vec4 FragColor; in vec2 TexCoords; uniform sampler2D screenTexture; uniform vec2 resolution; uniform float blurRadius; const float pi = 3.14159265; // Function to calculate Gaussian weight float Gaussian(float x, float sigma) { return exp(-(x * x) / (2.0 * sigma * sigma)) / (2.0 * pi * sigma * sigma); } void main() { vec2 tex_offset = 1.0 / resolution; // Gets the size of one texel float sigma = blurRadius / 3.0; // Define the sigma value for the Gaussian function; the divide by 3 rule creates a nice fall-off float weightSum = Gaussian(0.0, sigma); // Calculate the central weight vec4 blurColor = texture(screenTexture, TexCoords) * weightSum; // Apply central texel's color by the central weight // Number of samples on each side of the central texel int blurSize = int(ceil(3.0 * sigma)); // Accumulate fragment color from neighboring texels for (int x = -blurSize; x <= blurSize; x++) { for (int y = -blurSize; y <= blurSize; y++) { // Do not blur the center twice if (x == 0 && y == 0) continue; // Calculate the weight for the current texel float w = Gaussian(distance(vec2(x, y), vec2(0.0)), sigma); blurColor += texture(screenTexture, TexCoords + vec2(tex_offset.x * x, tex_offset.y * y)) * w; weightSum += w; } } // Normalize the blurred color by the total weightSum FragColor = blurColor / weightSum; } \`\`\` This shader assumes that you pass in the texture you want to blur, the resolution of the screen (or the texture), and the radius of the blur effect. You'll need to set up a quad that spans the entire screen and render it with this shader. Note that this is a very simple and not optimized way to do a blur effect. For a faster and more efficient blur, you might want to look into techniques such as two-pass Gaussian blurs, where you blur the scene horizontally in one pass and then vertically in another, making use of linear filtering to reduce the number of texture samples required. Remember that if you run this shader in a WebGL context, replace \`#version 330 core\` with a suitable WebGL \`#version\` shader directive (e.g., \`#version 300 es\` for WebGL 2.0)."},{"instruction":"glsl wave shader","output":"A wave shader can simulate the visual effect of waves, such as water waves, across a flat surface. The effect can be achieved by distorting the texture coordinates based on a sine wave or a similar periodic function. Below is an example of a simple GLSL fragment shader that applies a wave effect to a texture, creating the appearance of vertical waves moving horizontally across the texture. Vertex Shader (vertex_shader.glsl): \`\`\`glsl #version 330 core layout (location = 0) in vec3 aPos; layout (location = 1) in vec2 aTexCoords; out vec2 TexCoords; void main() { gl_Position = vec4(aPos, 1.0); TexCoords = aTexCoords; } \`\`\` Fragment Shader (fragment_shader.glsl): \`\`\`glsl #version 330 core out vec4 FragColor; in vec2 TexCoords; uniform sampler2D uTexture; uniform float uTime; // Uniform value representing the elapsed time since the start void main() { // Set the wave parameters float waveAmplitude = 0.1; // Amplitude of the wave float waveFrequency = 3.0; // Frequency of the wave float waveSpeed = 1.5; // Speed at which the wave moves // Calculate the wave displacement based on the y coordinate and time float wave = sin(TexCoords.y * waveFrequency + uTime * waveSpeed) * waveAmplitude; // Add horizontal movement to the waves float waveXMovement = 0.25 * sin(uTime * 0.5); // Apply the wave effect to the texture coordinates vec2 distortedTexCoords = TexCoords + vec2(wave + waveXMovement, 0.0); // Sample the texture with the distorted coordinates to produce the wave effect FragColor = texture(uTexture, distortedTexCoords); } \`\`\` This fragment shader uses a sine function to create the wave effect. The \`uTime\` uniform needs to be continuously updated by your application (usually on the CPU side) with the elapsed time, which allows the waves to animate over time. The \`waveAmplitude\`, \`waveFrequency\`, and \`waveSpeed\` values are parameters that you can adjust to change the appearance of the waves. The vertex shader is just a pass-through shader that doesn't alter the geometry and passes the texture coordinates through to the fragment shader. It's worth noting here that this is a basic example. Depending on the complexity of the wave effect you're trying to create, you might approach it differently, with more sophisticated mathematics, normal mapping for the appearance of lighting on water, or other techniques."},{"instruction":"absolutely basic GLSL shader example","output":"An absolutely basic GLSL shader example consists of two parts: the vertex shader and the fragment shader. The vertex shader processes each vertex passed to the GPU, and the fragment shader determines the color of each pixel. Here is a minimal example of a GLSL shader pair that renders a colored triangle on the screen. Vertex Shader (basic_vertex_shader.glsl): \`\`\`glsl #version 330 core layout (location = 0) in vec3 aPos; // Position input void main() { gl_Position = vec4(aPos, 1.0); // Set the position } \`\`\` Fragment Shader (basic_fragment_shader.glsl): \`\`\`glsl #version 330 core out vec4 FragColor; // Output that will be written to the framebuffer void main() { FragColor = vec4(1.0, 0.5, 0.2, 1.0); // Set the output color to orange } \`\`\` In this most basic example, the vertex shader takes the vertex positions (\`aPos\`) and simply passes them to the rasterizer by setting \`gl_Position\`. The fragment shader sets the color of each pixel to a static value, resulting in an orange triangle. Usage of this shader would require setting up a triangle using vertex data on the CPU side, activating this shader program, and issuing a draw call for the triangle geometry. These shaders are written with OpenGL Core Profile 3.3 in mind, which is the version that introduced the \`#version 330 core\` directive. For other contexts, like OpenGL ES and WebGL, you would use slightly different version declarations and potentially make syntax adjustments. For example, in WebGL you would write \`#version 300 es\` for GLSL ES 3.00, which corresponds with WebGL 2.0."},{"instruction":"Write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a concise background (in which the events of the preceding scene leading to the events in the current scene are briefly described, explaining the source of the returning woman's surmounting urge to relieve herself and the reason why she hasn't relieved herself properly by the time she reaches the house), for a very long comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity; all dialogues in the scene should have quotidian, simple language that people would actually use in such a scenario, with no excessive flourishes; all events and dialogues that occur once the returning woman enters the house should be elaborated upon in detail, without any of the prompts being omitted) in a Comedy Drama TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * A young Mexican American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she has a loving but testy relationship with the present woman; she has an aversion from pooping in bathrooms outside the privacy of her home and is secretive about her bowel movements; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans in the scene) is returning home from an evening out and approaching the door of her family’s apartment with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding to a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the smell is coming from the returning woman's pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how smelly she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, then blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to do that even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was compelled to release once getting past her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even at the expense of making a dirty mess in her pants for the sake of that relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman first expresses indignation about the returning woman blaming her for causing the incident after it has already been stated by the present woman that there is no excuse for the returning woman to childishly poop her pants, then mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman is satisfied about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposed satisfaction. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman derived much satisfaction from relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman is also childishly satisfied by having her pants full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants with satisfaction, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. As she is performing the physical gesture, the present woman ridicules how awfully smelly the seat of the childish returning woman's pants is and proceeds to scold the returning woman for making her pants so smelly. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because she unbearably stinks. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while reiterating that the returning woman unbearably stinks and imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the returning woman stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has entered the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reactiln to the odor that lingers while audibly complaining about how smelly the returning woman is.","output":"Title: \\"The Unfortunate Homecoming\\" Episode: \\"The Lockout\\" Genre: Comedy Drama Scene: \\"The Threshold Misadventure\\" FADE IN: EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING, CORRIDOR - NIGHT Young Mexican American woman, LUISA (26, wearing loose-fitting joggers and a cozy sweatshirt, hair tied up in a bun) is brisk-walking down the corridor. She has an urgent stride as she fumbles through her purse. The atmosphere hints at previous events. Earlier in the evening, Luisa faced a dilemma: Her bowels demanded freedom while she was out, but her aversion to public restrooms constrained them in painful silence. That, coupled with her secretiveness about such matters, has left her in dire straits as she approaches her family's apartment door. LUISA (muttering to herself) Where are they? Come on, keys... Her hand rummages desperately. No keys. Her face paints a mix of panic and need for relief. She pounds on the door. CUT TO: EXT. APARTMENT DOOR - CONTINUOUS Luisa knocks frantically, dancing in place as she squeezes her midsection, working to hold in the impending eruption. A beat of silence – too long for Luisa's comfort – passes before... MARIA (50s, kind-faced, with a comfort-first fashion sense indicative of one who favors function over form), Luisa's mother, shouts from within. MARIA (O.S.) (through the door) ¿Quién es? What’s happening? LUISA (pained yet urgent) Mom, it's me! Open the door, please. Quick! Luisa is nearly hopping now, each passing second dragging out like torture. INT. APARTMENT ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS Maria unlocks the door, methodical and oblivious to the urgency. Luisa's patience evaporates. LUISA (desperately) Mom, hurry! The door swings open. Maria stands there, puzzlement written over her concerned features. Luisa tries to push past, but Maria's maternal instincts kick in; she clutches Luisa. MARIA (stern yet concerned) Mija, what’s wrong with you? Luisa squirms to free herself. Their family bickering kicks in. LUISA (pleading) Mom, just let me go! Please! Maria tightens her grip, interrogative, protective. MARIA You’re scaring me. What’s happening? It’s the climax: Luisa can’t hold it anymore. A groan escapes, her expression aghast and relieved all at once. She gives into the inevitable, soiling her pants. LUISA (grunting; soft, relief-filled satisfaction) Oh God... I... I can’t... Maria, eyes wide, loosens her grip, at a loss. MARIA (faltering) Luisa, mijita...? Bewilderment hangs in the air as Luisa, with soft grunts, continues. Maria stares, a mix of confusion and dawning realization. Now fully inside, Maria sniffs tentatively, recoils, and voices her dawning horror. MARIA (exasperated disbelief) Luisa, did you...? No... Luisa's eyes plead with her mother, and she gingerly holds the seat of her pants to contain the disaster. LUISA (sheepishly) Can I just go to the bathroom now? Maria steps aside, disgust written all over her. MARIA (trying to comprehend) I just...did you...is it...from your pants? LUISA (waddling; sheepishly sullen) It wasn’t my fault, okay? Maria halts Luisa's advance, her face wrinkles in reproach. MARIA (taunting) This is no excuse for someone your age! Luisa plays the blame game. LUISA (playfully sulking) It's your fault – you took ages and blocked me! Maria incredulously retorts. MARIA (scolding) You just stood there and did... that! Luisa responds, stubbornly defensive. LUISA (appraising the bulk; wry complacency) I had to go. It just felt... relieving. As Luisa tries to leave, Maria grabs hold of her, reprimanding. MARIA (mocking) Nasty! You got some satisfaction from this? Curiosity overcomes her disgust. Maria peers at the bulging pants as Luisa timidly shows them off. LUISA (awkwardly conceding) Yeah, it’s full. And yes, it...well...it helped. Maria's face twists; she's incredulous yet infantilizing. MARIA (inspecting and sniffing; mocking) You're just a smelly little child now! Luisa cringes, embarrassment mixing with stubborn satisfaction. LUISA (admitting; playful yet sullen) Fine, since you’re keeping me here... Maria dismisses her comment with a scolding finality. MARIA (urgently herding) Enough. You stink. Go clean up. Now! With assisting hands, they shuffle off. Maria's nose scrunches, her complaints audible against Luisa's blushing cringes. LUISA (bashful) It feels like it’s going to fall... Maria reiterates her exasperated warnings. MARIA (careful; disgusted) Don't you dare make more mess! INT. BATHROOM THRESHOLD - MOMENTS LATER Luisa's final tease is interrupted as Maria pushes her playfully yet firmly into the bathroom, the mess inside her pants spreading. LUISA (outrage; disgust) Oh! That's so gross! Maria finally lets her grudgingly go, lingering complaints melding with disdain. MARIA (holding nose; exasperated) Just clean up your dirty, smelly self! The bathroom door shuts on the humiliating yet humorous scene. FADE OUT."},{"instruction":"This video showcases part of the 2006 CBBC pre-7am promo loop, which showcases the content on the channel, It cuts off after a few seconds because I taped over it in 2011 with a few episodes of GoGoRiki on Pop.

Voici une explication de chaque terme et leur différence: 1. Biopolymère: Un biopolymère est un polymère qui est produit par des êtres vivants, c'est-à-dire qu'il est d'origine biologique. Les biopolymères comprennent des substances comme les protéines, l'ADN, l'ARN, la cellulose et le chitosane. Ce sont des chaînes longues de molécules, produites par des organismes vivants, qui jouent un rôle crucial dans les fonctions biologiques. Les biopolymères peuvent être bio-dégradables, mais pas nécessairement. Cela dépend de leur structure chimique et de l'environnement dans lequel ils se trouvent. 2. Bioplastique: Un bioplastique est un type de plastique qui est soit bio-sourcé, soit biodégradable, ou les deux. Les bioplastiques bio-sourcés sont fabriqués à partir de ressources renouvelables, comme la canne à sucre, l'amidon de maïs, ou les lipides. Cela contraste avec les plastiques traditionnels qui sont généralement dérivés de combustibles fossiles. Certains bioplastiques sont également biodégradables, ce qui signifie qu'ils peuvent être décomposés par des micro-organismes en conditions naturelles ou industrielles pour revenir à des composés plus simples. Cependant, tous les bioplastiques ne sont pas biodégradables. 3. Polymère biodégradable: Un polymère biodégradable est un type de plastique qui peut être décomposé par des micro-organismes comme les bactéries et les champignons en eau, dioxyde de carbone (ou méthane dans des conditions anaérobies), et de la biomasse. La biodégradation des polymères dépend de leur structure chimique ainsi que des conditions environnementales. Les polymères biodégradables peuvent être soit bio-sourcés (comme le PLA, acide polylactique, fabriqué à partir de ressources végétales) soit synthétiques (comme le PBAT, adipate / téréphtalate de polybutylène, fabriqué à partir de produits chimiques pétrochimiques). En résumé: - Un biopolymère est une substance naturelle fabriquée par les organismes vivants. - Un bioplastique est un plastique qui est soit fait de matières premières renouvelables, soit biodégradable, ou les deux. - Un polymère biodégradable est un type de plastique (qu'il soit bio-sourcé ou pétrochimique) qui peut être décomposé par des organismes naturels. Ainsi, tous les biopolymères sont bio-sourcés par définition, mais ils ne sont pas tous biodégradables ou utilisés comme matériaux plastiques. De même, tous les bioplastiques sont soit bio-sourcés, soit biodégradables, voire les deux, mais ils ne sont pas nécessairement issus de biopolymères naturels. Enfin, les polymères biodégradables sont conçus pour se décomposer dans l'environnement, mais ils ne proviennent pas nécessairement de ressources renouvelables."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Questo processo consiste nel dividere le tabelle del database in parti più piccole e ottimizzate in modo che ogni tabella rappresenti un singolo tema o concetto. Gli obiettivi principali della normalizzazione sono: 1. Evitare la ridondanza dei dati: memorizzare la stessa informazione più volte può portare a disallineamenti e confusione. 2. Assicurare che i dati siano dipendenti in modo logico: tutte le informazioni in una tabella dovrebbero dipendere dalla chiave primaria. 3. Facilitare l'inserimento, l'aggiornamento e l'eliminazione dei dati, riducendo così la possibilità di errori. La normalizzazione si articola in diversi \\"livelli\\" chiamati \\"forme normali\\" (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, 4NF, 5NF, 6NF). Ecco una breve sintesi dei primi tre, che sono i più comunemente utilizzati: 1. Prima Forma Normale (1NF): richiede che in una tabella non ci siano gruppi ripetuti di campi, cioè i campi devono essere atomici e ogni record deve essere unico (cioè non ci possono essere duplicati). 2. Seconda Forma Normale (2NF): si basa sull'essere già in 1NF e richiede che tutti gli attributi non-chiave siano dipendenti in modo funzionale dalla chiave primaria intera. Questo significa eliminare le dipendenze funzionali parziali (attributi dipendenti solo da una parte della chiave primaria). 3. Terza Forma Normale (3NF): è necessario essere in 2NF e inoltre tutti gli attributi non-chiave devono dipendere solo dalla chiave primaria, e non da altre non-chiavi. In questo modo si eliminano le dipendenze funzionali transitive (quando un attributo non-chiave dipende da un altro attributo non-chiave). Forme normali successive affrontano questioni più complesse e sono meno frequentemente implementate. La normalizzazione è un compromesso tra efficienza dell'accesso ai dati e rapidità di manipolazione (modifica) dei dati. In alcuni casi, per motivi di performance, si può scegliere una \\"denormalizzazione\\" intenzionale, mantenendo una certa ridondanza dei dati per migliorare le prestazioni di lettura a scapito dello spazio di archiviazione e della difficoltà di mantenere i dati consistenti."},{"instruction":"Cosa si intende per Integrità referenziale?","output":"L'integrità referenziale è un concetto chiave nel design e nella gestione di un database relazionale che assicura la coerenza e la correttezza delle relazioni tra le tabelle. In un database relazionale, l'integrità referenziale si rifà alla proprietà che impone restrizioni sulle relazioni inter-tabella per mantenere la consistenza dei dati, in particolare quando si aggiungono, cancellano o modificano i record. L'integrità referenziale è comunemente applicata attraverso il meccanismo delle chiavi esterne (foreign keys). Una chiave esterna è un campo (o una combinazione di campi) in una tabella che corrisponde univocamente alla chiave primaria (primary key) di un'altra tabella. Il suo scopo è creare un link logico tra i record di due tabelle, indicando che i record in una tabella sono relazionati a record nell'altra tabella. Ecco alcuni principi dell'integrità referenziale: - **Vincoli di Chiave Esterna**: Le chiavi esterne devono corrispondere ai valori di un'altra tabella o essere null (se concesso). Questo assicura che non possano esistere riferimenti a dati che non esistono (record orfani). - **Regole di Azione Referenziale**: Quando si effettua un'operazione su una tabella che potrebbe violare l'integrità referenziale (come l'eliminazione o la modifica di un record collegato), il DBMS (Database Management System) eseguirà un'azione definita da queste regole. Queste possono includere: - **CASCADE**: se un record viene cancellato o modificato, queste modifiche si propagheranno verso i record collegati nelle altre tabelle. - **SET NULL**: se un record viene cancellato o il suo riferimento chiave primaria viene modificato, i corrispondenti campi delle chiavi esterne nei record collegati vengono impostati a NULL. - **SET DEFAULT**: simile a SET NULL, ma i campi delle chiavi esterne vengono impostati a un valore di default. - **NO ACTION/RESTRICT**: impedisce la cancellazione o la modifica del record nella tabella originale se ci sono record correlati che dipendono da esso. L'integrità referenziale è fondamentale per evitare anomalie nei database, come l’inserimento di dati inconsistenti o la perdita di dati critici, e per assicurare che le relazioni tra tabelle siano logicamente coerenti e facilmente navigabili."},{"instruction":"Cosa è un'Istanza Valida di R?","output":"In informatica e database, un'istanza valida di R è un termine che può riferirsi a un insieme di dati o record specifici che rispettano una data relazione R. \\"R\\" in questo contesto è spesso usato per rappresentare uno schema di relazione in un database relazionale o un tipo di dato in un linguaggio di programmazione. Esaminiamo cosa significa questo nelle due diverse aree: # Database Relazionali In un database relazionale, uno schema di relazione R descrive la struttura di una tabella, ovvero elenca le colonne (attributi) e i tipi di dati che possono avere, oltre a definire le chiavi primarie e le possibili chiavi esterne. Un'istanza valida di tale schema di relazione R è quindi un insieme concreto di record o righe che popolano la tabella seguendo le regole definite dallo schema, inclusive di: - Rispetto dei tipi di dati specificati per ciascun attributo. - Unicità dei valori della chiave primaria (ogni riga deve essere unica nella tabella). - Soddisfazione dei vincoli di integrità referenziale, se ci sono chiavi esterne. - Adesione ad altri vincoli come vincoli di integrità di dominio, vincoli CHECK, vincoli UNIQUE, ecc. # Programmazione In contesti di programmazione, R potrebbe riferirsi a una classe o un tipo di dato. Un'istanza valida in questo scenario sarebbe un oggetto o una variabile che ha un valore che corrisponde alla definizione della classe o del tipo di dato. In ambedue i casi, l'\\"istanza valida\\" è un concetto importante per garantire che i dati o gli oggetti manipolati rispettino le strutture e i vincoli definiti, sostentando così la correttezza e la prevedibilità del sistema."},{"instruction":"Che differenza c'è tra Dipendenza Funzionale e Chiave?","output":"In teoria dei database, la dipendenza funzionale e il concetto di chiave sono entrambi elementi fondamentali per comprendere l'organizzazione e l'integrità dei dati all'interno di un database relazionale, ma hanno significati e impieghi differenti. # Dipendenza Funzionale Una dipendenza funzionale è una relazione tra due insiemi di attributi in una relazione di un database. Più formalmente, se abbiamo una relazione R e due suoi sottoinsiemi di attributi X e Y, diciamo che \\"Y è funzionalmente dipendente da X\\" (denotato come X → Y) se e solo se ogni volta che due tuple (record) di R hanno lo stesso valore per X, esse hanno anche lo stesso valore per Y. In altre parole, il valore di X determina univocamente il valore di Y. Le dipendenze funzionali sono utilizzate per definire le forme normali di un database; esse sono essenziali per il processo di normalizzazione, ovvero per l'organizzazione delle tabelle in modo da ridurre la ridondanza e migliorare l'integrità dei dati. # Chiave Una chiave, nell'ambito di un database, è un attributo o un insieme di attributi che viene usato per identificare univocamente una tupla all'interno di una relazione. Le chiavi sono importanti in quanto garantiscono che ogni record in una tabella sia unico e possa essere individuato indipendentemente dagli altri. Esistono diversi tipi di chiavi: - **Chiave Primaria (Primary Key)**: Un'insieme minimo di attributi (spesso uno solo) che possono identificare univocamente ogni record all'interno di una tabella. Ogni tabella dovrebbe avere una chiave primaria e i valori di questa chiave devono essere unici e non nulli. - **Chiave Candidata (Candidate Key)**: Una chiave candidata è una versione più generale della chiave primaria. Qualsiasi attributo o insieme di attributi che può identificare univocamente i record in una tabella è considerato una chiave candidata. Se ci sono più chiavi candidate, una viene scelta come chiave primaria e le altre sono chiamate chiavi alternative (Alternate Keys). - **Chiave Esterna (Foreign Key)**: Un attributo o insieme di attributi che stabilisce un legame di riferimento tra i dati di due tabelle, dove la chiave esterna in una tabella corrisponde alla chiave primaria di un'altra tabella. In sintesi, la dipendenza funzionale è un concetto che descrive una relazione generica tra attributi all'interno di una tabella e viene usata, tra le altre cose, per definire le proprietà delle chiavi. Una chiave, invece, è un attributo specifico (o un insieme di essi) che serve per identificare univocamente gli elementi (tupla) di una tabella."},{"instruction":"Fattore di caricamento, cosa e' ?","output":"Il \\"fattore di caricamento\\" può avere significati diversi a seconda del contesto in cui viene utilizzato. Qui ci sono due contesti comuni in cui si incontra questo termine: # Informatica – Hashing Nel contesto delle strutture dati di hash, il fattore di caricamento, denominato anche come \\"load factor\\", è una misura che indica quanto una tabella hash è piena. Si calcola dividendo il numero di elementi presenti nella tabella hash per il numero totale di bucket (spazio di indirizzamento) disponibili. [ text{Fattore di Caricamento} = frac{text{Numero di Elementi nella Tabella Hash}}{text{Numero totale di Bucket}} ] Un fattore di caricamento alto significa che la tabella hash è più piena, il che può aumentare la probabilità di collisioni — situazioni in cui più chiavi vengono mappate allo stesso indice di bucket. Queste collisioni, a loro volta, possono degradare le prestazioni della struttura dati, rendendo le operazioni di ricerca, inserimento ed eliminazione potenzialmente meno efficienti. Per gestire al meglio il fattore di caricamento, molti sistemi implementano una strategia di ridimensionamento (rehashing) in cui la tabella hash viene espansa e tutti gli elementi vengono riassegnati ai bucket ogni volta che il fattore di caricamento raggiunge una certa soglia. # Ingegneria In ingegneria, in particolare nel campo delle costruzioni e del design strutturale, il \\"fattore di caricamento\\" può riferirsi a una misura della capacità di carico di una struttura rispetto al carico effettivamente applicato. Questo termine può essere correlato al concetto di sicurezza, ovvero il margine tra il carico effettivo che la struttura deve sostenere e il carico massimo che essa può sostenere prima di fallire. Questo tipo di fattore di caricamento è usato per garantire che la struttura sia sicura e affidabile durante il suo utilizzo previsto."},{"instruction":"Puoi spiegari gli assiomi di Armstrong nel contesto delle Dipendenze Funzionali? Grazie","output":"Gli assiomi di Armstrong sono regole utilizzate nel contesto dei database relazionali per inferire tutte le possibili dipendenze funzionali (DF) a partire da un insieme di DF date. Si tratta di un insieme di regole logiche che possono essere applicate ripetutamente per derivare tutte le dipendenze che si applicano a uno schema di database, data una serie iniziale di dipendenze funzionali conosciute. Questi assiomi sono stati definiti da William W. Armstrong nel 1974 e sono fondamentali per il processo di normalizzazione di database. I tre assiomi di base di Armstrong sono: 1. **Riflessività (o Assegnazione)**: Se in un'insieme di attributi Y tutto l'insieme X è presente, allora X può determinare Y (X → Y). In altre parole, se Y è un sottoinsieme di X, allora si ha che X → Y. Questo è intuitivo poiché se hai tutte le informazioni di X, di certo hai anche le informazioni contenute in un suo sottoinsieme Y. [ X supseteq Y Rightarrow X → Y ] 2. **Potenziamento (o Ampliamento)**: Se una dipendenza X → Y esiste, allora è possibile aggiungere altri attributi a entrambi i lati della dipendenza, mantenendo valida la dipendenza stessa. [ X → Y Rightarrow XZ → YZ ] Ciò significa che se sappiamo che un insieme di attributi X determina un insieme Y, l'aggiunta di ulteriori attributi Z a entrambi gli insiemi non cambierà la verità della dipendenza. 3. **Transitività**: Se due dipendenze funzionali X → Y e Y → Z esistono, possiamo inferire una terza dipendenza funzionale X → Z (se X determina Y e Y determina Z, allora X determina anche Z). [ X → Y text{ e } Y → Z Rightarrow X → Z ] Questi sono gli assiomi di base, ma esistono anche regole derivate che possono essere ottenute combinando gli assiomi di base tra loro. Tra le regole derivate più comuni troviamo: - **Unione**: Se X → Y e X → Z, allora X determina anche la combinazione degli attributi Y e Z, ovvero X → YZ. - **Decomposizione (o Proiezione)**: Se X → YZ, allora possiamo decomporre in X → Y e X → Z. - **Pseudotransitività**: Se X → Y e YZ → W, allora possiamo inferire che XZ → W. Questi assiomi e regole derivate sono estremamente utili per la teoria relazionale, specialmente nel processo di normalizzazione dei database, dove l'obiettivo è quello di strutturare le tabelle in modo da ridurre la ridondanza e aumentare la coerenza dei dati attraverso la corretta identificazione e applicazione delle dipendenze funzionali."},{"instruction":"Spiegami questa definizione di Derivazione: Una derivazione di f da F è una sequenza finita f1,..., fm di dipendenze, dove fm= f e ogni fi è un elemento di F oppure è ottenuta dalla precedenti f1,..., fi-1 della derivazione usando una regola di inferenza.","output":"La definizione di derivazione che hai fornito si riferisce alla maniera in cui possono essere generate nuove dipendenze funzionali partendo da un insieme dato di dipendenze funzionali in un database relazionale. Questo processo è fondamentale per lavorare con le proprietà teoriche dei database relazionali, in particolare nel contesto della normalizzazione. In questa definizione: - **f**: Rappresenta la dipendenza funzionale finale che vogliamo dimostrare o derivare. - **F**: È l'insieme base delle dipendenze funzionali (DF) note, quelle da cui partiamo. - **f1, ..., fm**: Rappresentano la sequenza di dipendenze funzionali che costituiscono la derivazione. Un passaggio chiave in questa definizione è il concetto di \\"regola di inferenza\\". Una regola di inferenza è una legge logica che ci dice come possiamo validamente passare da alcuni enunciati (in questo caso, dipendenze funzionali) ad altri. Nel contesto dei database relazionali, queste regole sono spesso gli assiomi di Armstrong, che include la riflessività, il potenziamento, e la transitività, oltre ad altre regole che possono derivarne, come l'unione e la decomposizione. Quindi, una derivazione di una dipendenza funzionale **f** dall'insieme **F** significa che esiste un modo di partire dalle dipendenze note in **F** e, utilizzando una serie di passi (ciascuno dei quali è rappresentato dalle dipendenze **f1,..., fi,..., fm**), arrivare a concludere che la dipendenza **f** è una conseguenza logica di quelle in **F**. Ogni passo nella sequenza (**fi**) può essere una delle seguenti: 1. Un membro dell'insieme originario delle dipendenze funzionali **F** (si parte da ciò che è già noto). 2. Una dipendenza funzionale che è stata ottenuta applicando una regola di inferenza alle dipendenze precedenti nella sequenza (cioè, derivandole da quelle già stabilite come valide nei passi precedenti). Questo procedimento mostra come si possa \\"costruire\\" tutte le dipendenze deducibili e quindi implicite nell'insieme **F**, inclusa, in ultima istanza, la dipendenza **f** di interesse. Quando si fa questo in un contesto sistematico, come durante la normalizzazione di uno schema di database, stiamo essenzialmente cercando di capire tutte le dipendenze che esistono tra gli attributi delle nostre tabelle in modo da organizzarli nel modo più efficiente e logico possibile."},{"instruction":"Cosa è una chiave candidata?","output":"Una chiave candidata è un termine utilizzato nel modello relazionale dei database per indicare un insieme di attributi che può identificare univocamente ogni tupla (record) in una relazione (tabella). In altre parole, è un insieme minimale di attributi tale che non ci sono due tuple diverse nella relazione che hanno gli stessi valori in tutti gli attributi di questa chiave. Una relazione può avere più di una chiave candidata e ciascuna di esse è potenzialmente in grado di fungere da chiave primaria. Di solito, gli sviluppatori o i progettisti del database selezionano una di queste chiavi candidate come chiave primaria in base a criteri come l'efficienza, l'usabilità, la significatività di business, ecc. Le caratteristiche principali di una chiave candidata sono: 1. Unicità: Nessuna coppia di tuple può avere lo stesso valore nei campi che formano la chiave candidata. Questo assicura che la chiave possa servire a identificare in modo unico ogni record. 2. Minimalità: La chiave candidata è un insieme di attributi minimale; l'eliminazione di qualsiasi attributo dalla chiave candidata la priverebbe della sua proprietà di unicità. In altre parole, se una chiave candidata ha n attributi, nessun sottoinsieme di meno di n attributi è sufficiente a mantenere la proprietà di unicità. Ogni chiave candidata che non sia selezionata come chiave primaria è spesso denominata \\"chiave alternativa\\". Nel caso in cui un database sia progettato in maniera tale che ci sia soltanto una chiave candidata identificabile, quella sarà per necessità anche la chiave primaria della tabella. Per esempio, considerando una tabella \\"Studenti\\" in un database scolastico, possibili chiavi candidate potrebbero essere \\"Numero di Matricola\\" (ogni studente ha un numero di matricola unico e nessun altro studente condivide lo stesso numero) o una combinazione di \\"Nome\\", \\"Cognome\\" e \\"Data di Nascita\\" (assumendo che non ci siano due studenti con esattamente lo stesso nome, cognome e data di nascita). Di queste chiavi candidate, il \\"Numero di Matricola\\" potrebbe essere scelto come chiave primaria per la sua semplicità ed efficacia nell'identificare ogni studente."},{"instruction":"Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.
