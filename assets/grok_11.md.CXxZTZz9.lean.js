Movie title: Life of Brian Movie plot: Brian Cohen is born in a stable a few doors down from the one in which Jesus is born, a fact which initially confuses the three wise men who come to praise the baby Jesus, as they must put up with Brian's boorish mother Mandy until they realize their mistake.Brian grows up to be an idealistic young man who resents the continuing Roman occupation of Judea, even after learning his father was a Roman Centurion - Naughtius Maximus. While attending Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, he becomes attracted to a young female rebel, Judith. His desire for Judith and hatred for the Romans lead him to join the People's Front of Judea, one of many factious and bickering separatist movements, who spend more time fighting each other than the Romans.The group's cynical leader Reg gives Brian his first assignment as a rebel: an attempt at scrawling some graffiti (\\"Romanes eunt domus\\", poorly translated Latin for \\"Romans Go Home\\") on the wall of the governor's palace. He is soon confronted by a passing Centurion who, in disgust at Brian's faulty Latin grammar, forces him to write out the grammatically correct message (\\"Romani ite domum\\") one hundred times. The walls of the fortress are literally covered in text by dawn.When the Roman guards change shifts at daybreak, the new guards immediately try to arrest Brian. After a series of misadventures, the fugitive winds up in a motley group of mystics and prophets who harangue the passing crowd in a plaza. Forced to come up with something plausible in order to blend in, he babbles pseudo-religious nonsense which quickly attracts a small but intrigued audience. Once the Roman guards have left, Brian tries to put the episode behind him, but has unintentionally inspired a movement; and a crowd begins to follow him around, with even the slightest unusual occurrence being hailed as a \\"miracle.\\" After slipping away from the mob (who are busy persecuting a \\"heretic\\") and spending the night with Judith, he discovers that an enormous crowd proclaiming him the Messiah has formed outside his... The answer is:","output":"Yes, Brian does get crucified in the movie \\"Life of Brian.\\" Towards the end of the film, after numerous comedic misadventures, Brian is captured by the Romans. He is then sentenced to be crucified along with several others. In a satirical take on crucifixion, the scene showcases upbeat singing and an ironic theme of looking at the bright side of life, despite the dire circumstances. As the movie progresses, Brian becomes an unwilling and accidental messiah figure, with people mistakenly believing him to have divine powers. This culminates in his crucifixion – an event that bears a parallel to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, albeit in a highly satirical and comedic manner. The film \\"Life of Brian\\" has been hailed by some as a classic comedy, but has also been criticized for its controversial religious themes.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article in one sentence. It may seem corny to you at first, but repeating self-affirmations to yourself will help you practice self-compassion. As you brush your teeth or get ready for work, repeat a mantra that is meaningful to you and expresses kindness to yourself.  For example, you might say something like, “I accept myself today for who I am” or “I love myself completely.” If you have particular areas of weakness, such as anxiety or body image issues, try focusing your self-affirmations on those. For example, if you experience frequent anxiety, a helpful self-affirmation might be “I will do the best that I can do today. I cannot do more than my best. I cannot control others’ actions.” If you experience body image issues, try finding something positive to focus on: “I will be kind to my body today, because I deserve kindness” or \\"I look happy and healthy today.\\" Confidence is key when becoming emotionally stronger. Being confident in the fact that you are a unique and worthy individual will help you feel more in control of your emotions. When something bad happens, remind yourself that you have the ability to overcome this obstacle, whatever it may be.  Remind yourself that even the difficulties you have gone through are learning experiences. You can draw strength and courage from knowing that you have made it through tough times, and you can do it again.  Make a list of things you like about yourself. These could be skills, personal strengths, achievements...anything. Don't minimize your abilities and good qualities. If you're having trouble thinking of things, ask a friend to help you. They probably see many wonderful things about you that you might not even be aware of.  Set yourself a (reasonable) challenge to accomplish. For example, you could learn to cook a meal for your friends, or learn a few new poses in yoga, or learn to take artsy photographs. If you love to exercise, train for a 5k or 10k. Once you have accomplished this goal, celebrate it! Honor your successes, no matter how small they may seem to you. Don't compare yourself to others. This is a surefire way to damage anyone's self-confidence. Only you are the unique person who is you. The only person whose approval you need to seek is yours. Set goals that matter to you, and don't worry if they're not the same as everyone else's. Your physical health can directly affect your emotional health, and vice versa. Caring for your physical health can help you feel less stressed. It can also increase your feelings of well-being and make it easier for you to handle your emotions. Exercising is an important part of staying emotionally healthy. When you exercise, your body releases endorphins that make you happy. Next time you find yourself getting upset, go on a walk, run, or to the gym. Studies have shown that regular, moderate exercise makes you feel calmer and happier. ” You can develop emotional strength by focusing on positive emotions such as compassion and gratitude. Maintaining a compassionate, grateful attitude will help you understand that many of your fears and anxieties are shared by others. This will allow you to be kind to yourself and to others.  Research has shown that people who regularly practice active gratitude are more resilient in handling trauma. It can also help you interpret even the suffering and negative things in life as learning and survival experiences that have contributed to the self you are now. Gratitude can help keep you from judging others.  Gratitude is more than feeling grateful. We often cannot control what feelings appear. Trying to control those feelings can overwhelm us. Instead, gratitude is an active exercise in recognizing and savoring the positive. Keeping a gratitude journal, learning prayers of gratitude in your spiritual tradition, and stopping to savor a beautiful or positive experience can all help you practice gratitude. Exercising empathy for others can help you build stronger, healthier relationships. It can also help you develop healthier ways of dealing with your own emotions and feelings.  Studies have shown that “loving-kindness” or “compassion” meditation can be a good way to exercise your empathy muscles.Compassion meditation not only enhances your feelings towards others, it has also been shown to decrease depressive symptoms. There are many ways to practice compassion meditation, although several methods stem from Buddhist traditions.  Read novels. Fiction can encourage you to imagine what it would be like to experience emotions and situations unlike you own. Some studies suggest that reading novels can increase your ability to empathize with others.  Avoid jumping to conclusions. Studies have shown that when we think about what others “deserve,” we feel less empathy for them. Try not to assume that others “deserve” or are responsible for their suffering. Extend that same compassion to yourself, too. We’re all human. Uncertainty can be scary, and it can be the cause of a lot of emotional trouble. Being unable to live with uncertainty can cause you to constantly worry, avoid uncertain situations, and become overly reliant on others’ reassurance. Uncertainty is also an unavoidable fact of human life. You can develop your emotional strength by practicing accepting uncertainty.  “Intolerance of uncertainty” plays a large role in anxiety. When you have a low tolerance for uncertainty, you find it difficult to accept that it is not impossible for something negative to happen. You may ask “What if” questions or overestimate the risks and consequences of a negative situation or event. You may find yourself consumed with worry. Keep a journal throughout the day of times when you feel uncertain or anxious. Write down, as specifically as possible, what triggered these feelings. How did you respond to them?  Rank your uncertainties. Try to place things that make you feel uncomfortable or anxious on a scale from 0-10. For example, “going shopping without a list” might rank as a 2, but “delegating a project to someone else at work” might be an 8 or 9.  Practice tolerating uncertainty. Start safe and small. Learn to manage your fear of uncertainty by exposing yourself to it in safe, manageable situations. For example, if you only ever go to one restaurant because you’re worried you wouldn’t like the food somewhere else, try to pick a new place and eat something you have never tried before. You may or may not enjoy the food. However, you will have shown yourself that you can handle uncertainty and come out okay on the other side. Work up to bigger uncertainties gradually.  Record your responses. When you try out something uncertain, record what happened when you did this. What did you do? How did you feel while you were doing it? How did it turn out? If things didn’t go as planned (and this will happen), how did you respond? Were you able to handle the unexpected outcome? Ruminating is a common response to many emotions, especially feelings of sadness or anger. When you ruminate, you obsess about things. You think about a particular situation, thought, or feeling over and over again. It’s like a broken record that keeps playing the same 5 seconds of a song. Ruminating can keep you from coming up with a helpful solution to a problem. It can also trap you in a cycle of negative thinking that can lead to depression and stress. Perfectionism can foster ruminating. So can an “excessive relational focus,” where you overvalue your relationships so much that you will do anything to keep them, even when that is costly or unhealthy. Part of a ruminating loop is getting stuck on the same negative thought. Rather than allowing yourself to think the same thoughts over and over, challenge those negative thoughts! Reframe the negative thoughts in positive terms.  For example, if you have recently broken up with a romantic partner, it can be easy to focus on everything that went wrong. These thoughts can become exaggerated, to where you might feel like the situation was all your fault. You might rehearse “what if” thoughts. You might feel like you’re a failure and you can’t do anything right. Instead, try to focus on a productive, realistic thought. For example: “My relationship with that person ended. I didn’t want that to happen, but I can form another healthy relationship. I can use all I've learned from this one to have a stronger relationship with the next person.” Ruminating often focuses on abstract, unanswerable questions such as “Why does this always happen to me?” or “What’s wrong with me?” Rather than focus on huge, vague ideas that may not even be accurate, try to think about specifics you can do to address your problem.  For example, if you’re worried that your work isn’t going well, make a list of specific actions you can take to address that situation. Call a friend or someone you trust for help, if you can’t think of anything on your own. As another example, perhaps you are frustrated because your romantic relationships always seem to end up the same way. Think specifically about what traits you look for in a romantic partner. What sorts of people are you attracted to? What do you tend to do in relationships with them? What do they tend to do? Are any of these elements related to how your relationships end up? Feeling emotionally weak might make it more difficult for you express your feelings, thoughts, and needs to others. Practicing assertive communication will help you make sure that you are clearly communicating your needs and desires. It may also help you feel more confident in yourself.  Being assertive is very different from being arrogant. Being assertive about your emotions doesn’t mean that you don’t consider others’ feelings. In fact, you respect others’ emotions and needs. You also respect your own emotions and needs. By establishing communication based on mutual respect and openness, you will become a stronger communicator. Arrogant people often base their strength and confidence on external factors, such as how others think of them. This can cause arrogant individuals to prioritize their own feelings over others’. Being assertive means that you know that you have self-worth on your own. You can communicate your feelings openly, honestly, and respectfully because you are not worried how others will judge you.  Use “I”-statements. This will help you own your emotions without “mind-reading” or making others feel blamed. For example, if your partner forgot your birthday, don’t assume that it is because s/he doesn’t care about you and react based on that. Instead, use an “I”-statement to state how you feel: “I felt hurt when you forgot my birthday. I’d like to talk about what happened.” Rather than assigning blame and making the other person defensive, you’ve expressed your feelings and invited the other person to share their experience. If you wait until you feel like making a change in your emotional life, you may wait a long time. Practice behaving as if you already have made progress. Learning to tolerate the discomfort and uncertainty from new ways of thinking and behaving is a great way to become stronger emotionally. For example, if you feel isolated and sad because you tend to be shy and not approach new people, choose to behave differently. You may not “feel like” going out or striking up a conversation at first, but you will become more comfortable with practice. Even more importantly, you will know that you are taking steps to become stronger and healthier. It’s a common myth that therapy is only for people whose issues are so \\"serious\\" that they have no other option. This isn’t true. A therapist or counselor can help you learn to understand and process your emotions. They can help you learn coping techniques and how to become a stronger, healthier person.  There are many types of health professionals. Psychiatrists and Psychiatric Nurse Practitioners are usually the only ones who prescribe medication. They may also offer counseling. Clinical Psychologists, Licensed Clinical Social Workers, Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists, and Licensed Professional Counselors can all offer counseling services. Many services offer counseling and therapy. Talk with your doctor or insurance company to find someone in your location.","output":"Repeating self-affirmations, practicing gratitude and empathy, accepting uncertainty, reframing negative thoughts, communicating assertively, and seeking professional help can contribute to building emotional strength and improving mental well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The detained man, reported to be a Swedish national, has a history of psychiatric problems, the Spanish interior minister said. Barcelona's city hall said the truck had been stolen. Police started pursuing the vehicle after the driver, who was travelling at high speeds, failed to stop when ordered to do so, regional police chief Joan Carles Molinero said. The driver then turned to make his way along the wrong side of a ring road in the city, finally coming to a stop when the truck hit a wall at about 11:00 local time (10:00 GMT). Around 20 officers and at least six police cars arrived quickly on site, where several gas bottles were later seen lying on the ground. At least one gunshot was visible on the windscreen of the truck, although officials have not said whether there were any injuries following the incident. Spanish national television TVE reported that the truck had rammed several cars before police fired several times to stop it. Spain's interior minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said in a tweet that the incident on Tuesday was \\"not a case of a terrorist act\\". \\"The detained driver of the stolen butane gas truck has a psychiatric history,\\" Mr Zoido said.

Lots of special effects, and for a movie that's not made on mega budget, this movie really does great job of creating a fantasy masterpiece. I'm one of the guys who didn't understand the story at all, but this was still a great flick to watch. It's definitely up there in standards surpassing Bored of the Rings, and on par with movies like Harry Potter. Which is saying a lot for a movie again, made on a fraction of the budget of these international hits. One thing I really love about this movie is that it so stretches the envelope of adventure movie to come out of Hong Kong. The topic is exotic and original. Production quality is unlike anything seen coming out of HK for fantasy action movie, and acting is great. One of the best movies to come out of Hong Kong, this is the Infernal Affairs of Hong Kong fantasy movie, and I hope they'll continue working in this area, until they surpass Hollywood adventure movies.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: John couldn't arise from his position, so he remained at his desk. What might his position be? Possible A: get down, kneeling, lie down, lay down, sitting down  Why is \\"sitting down\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Sitting down\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for several reasons, which will be discussed in detail below: 1. Context: In the given context, John is described to be at his desk. It is most likely that someone at a desk would be in a seated position. Desks are commonly designed to be utilized while sitting down on chairs or stools. Therefore, given the context, human common sense would associate the position with sitting down, rather than other possible positions. 2. Social and cultural norms: In many societies and cultures, the standard practice when working at a desk or an office environment involves sitting down. Humans have been conditioned to expect that a person would be sitting while working at a desk. Hence, common sense would again guide one towards choosing \\"sitting down\\" as a likely position of John. 3. Ergonomics and practicality: Desks and chairs are commonly designed with ergonomics in mind, offering a comfortable and efficient workspace for an individual. Most desks are built at a height meant for the use of a chair. Attempting to work at a desk from a position like kneeling, lying down, or laying down would be impractical and uncomfortable, making it less likely for John to be in these positions while at his desk. 4. Frequency and probability: The position of \\"sitting down\\" is a more frequently observed position at a desk compared to the other given options. Human common sense is influenced by the frequency and likelihood of encountering various situations in daily life. Since it is more common to observe people sitting down at desks in most settings, this position would be considered more aligned with human common sense. 5. Language and idiomatic usage: The question's phrasing, \\"John couldn't arise from his position,\\" suggests that John was in a position that required some effort or assistance to stand up from. Comparatively, sitting down is an easier position to arise from than lying or kneeling positions, making it more likely that common sense would lead to the conclusion that he was sitting down. Additionally, \\"remaining at his desk\\" is a phrase that is frequently used to imply that an individual continues to perform their work in a seated position, which further reinforces the idea of sitting down being the common sense answer. In summary, the answer \\"sitting down\\" is aligned with human common sense due to the context of the question, social and cultural norms, ergonomics and practicality, frequency and probability of observed positions, and the language and idiomatic usage."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In 1828 Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant who had arrived with his wife and family on the brig Ellen on 29–30 July 1828, was granted an allotment on the western side of Stirling Ridge. A second grant was made to William Klensendorlffe (a German who had served in the British Navy and arrived free in the Colony in 1818), who had bought the land from John Stephen, on 7 March 1839. Donnison's land was named Yarralumla in a survey of the area conducted in 1834. Yarralumla was a name for the area used by the local people, apparently meaning \\"echo\\". An area to the west of what is now the suburb was the Yarrolumla parish.The prominent New South Wales parliamentarian Sir Terence Aubrey Murray (1810–1873) purchased Yarralumla in 1837. He lived there with his wife Mary Murray (née Gibbes, 1817–1858), the second daughter of the Collector of Customs for NSW, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873), MLC. In 1859, Murray sold Yarralumla to his brother-in-law, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes (1828–1897). Later that same year, Augustus' parents came to live with him at Yarralumla homestead. Augustus Gibbes improved the estate and acquired additional land by purchase and lease. However, In 1881, he sold Yarralumla for 40,000 pounds to Frederick Campbell, a descendant of Robert Campbell, in order to travel overseas. Frederick Campbell erected a new, three-storey, brick house on the site of the former Yarralumla homestead at the beginning of the 1890s. Campbell's house would later form the basis of what is now the Governor-General of Australia's official Canberra residence, known colloquially as \\"Yarralumla\\" or \\"Government House\\". Campbell also built a large wooden woolshed nearby in 1904.

Donald Trump and the Central Park Five: the racially charged rise of a demagogue Yusef Salaam was 15 years old when Donald Trump demanded his execution for a crime he did not commit. Nearly three decades before the rambunctious billionaire began his run for president – before he called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States, for the expulsion of all undocumented migrants, before he branded Mexicans as “rapists” and was accused of mocking the disabled – Trump called for the reinstatement of the death penalty in New York following a horrific rape case in which five teenagers were wrongly convicted. The miscarriage of justice is widely remembered as a definitive moment in New York’s fractured race relations. But Trump’s intervention – he signed full-page newspaper advertisements implicitly calling for the boys to die – has been gradually overlooked as the businessman’s chances of winning the Republican nomination have rapidly increased. Now those involved in the case of the so-called Central Park Five and its aftermath say Trump’s rhetoric served as an unlikely precursor to a unique brand of divisive populism that has powered his rise to political prominence in 2016. Related: Media outlets dare to call Donald Trump a liar, racist and misogynist “He was the fire starter,” Salaam said of Trump, in his first extended interview since Trump announced his run for the White House. “Common citizens were being manipulated and swayed into believing that we were guilty.” It was 1989. The crack epidemic had torn through New York as poverty soared to 25% and the city’s elites reaped the rewards of a booming Wall Street. The murder rate had risen to 1,896 killings a year; 3,254 rapes would be reported in the five boroughs, but only one captured the city’s extended attention and later exposed bias in its criminal justice system and media establishment. On the evening of 19 April, as 28-year-old investment banker Trisha Meili, who was white, jogged across the northern, dilapidated section of Central Park, she was brutally attacked – bludgeoned with a rock, gagged, tied and raped. She was left for dead but discovered hours later, unconscious and suffering from hypothermia and severe brain damage. The New York police department believed they already had the culprits in custody. That same night, a group of more than 30 youths had entered the park from East Harlem. Some engaged in a rampage of random criminality, hurling rocks at cars, assaulting and mugging passersby. Among the group was Salaam, along with 14-year-olds Raymond Santana and Kevin Richardson, 15-year-old Antron McCray and 16-year-old Korey Wise. The teenagers – four African American and one Hispanic – would become known collectively as the Central Park Five. They would all later deny any involvement in criminality that night, but as they were rounded up and interrogated by the police at length, they said, they were forced into confessing to the rape. “I would hear them beating up Korey Wise in the next room,” recalled Salaam. “They would come and look at me and say: ‘You realise you’re next.’ The fear made me feel really like I was not going to be able to make it out.” Four of the boys signed confessions and appeared on video without a lawyer, each arguing that while they had not been the individual to commit the rape they had witnessed one of the others do it, thereby implicating the entire group. The city erupted. The case came to embody not only fears that accompanied the dramatic rise of violent crime in New York, but also its perceived racial dynamics. The case of a black woman, raped the same day in Brooklyn by two men who threw her from the roof of a four-story building, received little media attention. Just two weeks after the Central Park attack, before any of the boys had faced trial and while Meili remained critically ill in a coma, Donald Trump, whose office on Fifth Avenue commanded an exquisite view of the park’s opulent southern frontier, intervened. He paid a reported 85,000 to take out advertising space in four of the city’s newspapers, including the New York Times. Under the headline “Bring Back The Death Penalty. Bring Back The Police!” and above his signature, Trump wrote: “I want to hate these muggers and murderers. They should be forced to suffer and, when they kill, they should be executed for their crimes. They must serve as examples so that others will think long and hard before committing a crime or an act of violence.” Salaam, now 41, cannot remember exactly where he was when he first saw the ads. He had no idea who Trump was. “I knew that this famous person calling for us to die was very serious,” he recalled. “We were all afraid. Our families were afraid. Our loved ones were afraid. For us to walk around as if we had a target on our backs, that’s how things were.” All five minors had already been paraded in front of the cameras and had their names and addresses published, but Salaam said he and his family received more death threats after the papers ran Trump’s full-page screed. On a daytime TV show two days later, a female audience member called for the boys to be castrated and echoed the calls for the death penalty if Meili died. Pat Buchanan, the former Republican White House aide, called for the oldest of the group, Wise, to be “tried, convicted and hanged in Central Park by June 1”. “Had this been the 1950s, that sick type of justice that they wanted – somebody from that darker place of society would have most certainly came to our homes, dragged us from our beds and hung us from trees in Central Park. It would have been similar to what they did to Emmett Till,” Salaam said. All five boys pleaded not guilty at trial the following year. The prosecution’s case rested almost entirely on the confessions they had given shortly after the incident. As would become crucial later on, there was no DNA evidence linking any of them to the crime scene and Meili, who made a miraculous recovery and testified in court, could not remember any details of the attack. The jury found all five boys guilty. The court condemned them to prison to serve sentences ranging from five to 10 years and five to 15 years. Wise, who had remained in the city’s notorious Rikers Island jail, was sentenced as an adult. Michael Warren, the veteran New York civil rights lawyer who would later come to represent the Central Park Five, is certain that Trump’s advertisements played a role in securing conviction. “He poisoned the minds of many people who lived in New York and who, rightfully, had a natural affinity for the victim,” said Warren. “Notwithstanding the jurors’ assertions that they could be fair and impartial, some of them or their families, who naturally have influence, had to be affected by the inflammatory rhetoric in the ads.” A spokeswoman for Trump’s campaign declined to comment. For many who have studied Trump’s rise to prominence, the Central Park case provided an early glimpse into how his racially charged views entered his political and tactical mindset. “He has this penchant for what you might call otherising,” said Michael D’Antonio, the author of Never Enough, a recently published Trump biography. “I think he knew what he was doing by taking a side, and I think he knew he was aligning himself with law and order, especially white law and order. I don’t think that he was consciously saying ‘I’d like to whip up racial animosity’, but his impulse is to run into conflict and controversy rather than try to help people understand what might be going on in a reasoned way.” I think he knew what he was doing by taking a side, and I think he knew he was aligning himself with white law and order Two years before the Central Park case, Trump had briefly considered a run for president that most dismissed as a naked attempt to drum up publicity for his book The Art of the Deal, released later that year. But he couldn’t resist the opportunity to speak in New Hampshire at the invitation of the Portsmouth Republican committee, using the platform to single out allies in Saudi Arabia and Japan while critiquing US foreign policy in the Persian Gulf. He employed the same tactics as he would in 1989, publishing full-page ads in three of America’s biggest newspapers that called for the US to impose taxes on these allies, whom he argued were “taking advantage of the United States”. In February 2000, when Trump was again flirting with a run for the White House, he took out anonymous ads in local upstate New York newspapers, in an effort to shut down a rival casino backed by a group of Native Americans. Beneath a picture of needles and drug paraphernalia, the ad stated: “Are these the new neighbors we want?” It added: “The St. Regis Mohawk Indian record of criminal activity is well documented.” Trump later apologised, but his biographer argued the incident underlined a “willingness to use rhetoric that other people won’t use under the guise of talking straight” that is now a fixture on the campaign trail. After declaring in his campaign announcement that Mexico was “bringing crime” and “rapists” to the US, Trump quickly seized on the murder case of a 32-year-old white woman in San Francisco in which an undocumented Mexican migrant is the chief suspect. He has since frequently condoned and incited violence against protesters at his rallies, and has vowed to bring back waterboarding of terror suspects. In referencing a promise to issue an executive order to mandatorily execute anyone in the US who kills a police officer, he said: “We just can’t afford any more to be so politically correct.” But examples of overt racism were perhaps kept behind closed doors in the late 1980s. One year after the Central Park Five were convicted, John O’Donnell, a former executive who ran Trump Plaza hotel and casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, published a tell-all alluding to his former boss’s casual racism behind closed doors. He quoted Trump as saying: “I’ve got black accountants at Trump Castle and at Trump Plaza. Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day.” In a later interview with Playboy magazine, Trump labelled his former employee a “fucking loser” but added: “The stuff O’Donnell wrote about me is probably true.” But Barbara Res, a member of Trump’s inner circle through much of the 1980s who served as his executive vice-president in 1989, told the Guardian she never witnessed any signs of racism throughout her time at his company and was “surprised” by his inflammatory rhetoric today. “I think he got angry when he saw what happened to that woman, and I think he reacted to it,” she said of the Central Park jogger case. “I think we were all horrified at what happened. I think everybody basically supported Donald. I don’t think he was trying to be racist – I think he was trying to be a proponent of law and order.” For Salaam, however, the intent was explicit: “If we were white, would Donald Trump had written this in the paper?” In 2002, after Salaam had served seven years in prison, Matias Reyes, a violent serial rapist and murderer already serving life inside, came forward and confessed to the Central Park rape. He stated that he had acted by himself. A re-examination of DNA evidence proved it was his semen alone found on Meili’s body, and just before Christmas that year, the convictions against each member of the Central Park Five were vacated by New York’s supreme court. By this point, Trump had gotten his wish: the death penalty had been reinstated in New York since 1995, at great cost to the state. It was subsequently abolished in 2007, without a single execution carried out. Following a 14-year court battle, the Central Park Five settled a civil case with the city for 41m in 2014. But far from offering an apology for his conduct in 1989, Trump was furious. In an opinion piece for the New York Daily News, he described the case as the “heist of the century”. “Settling doesn’t mean innocence, but it indicates incompetence on several levels,” Trump wrote, alluding to how police and prosecutors initially involved in the case have long maintained the five boys were involved in the rape, even after the convictions were thrown out. D’Antonio, the biographer, met with Trump shortly after the settlement was announced. The billionaire was once again considering a shot at the presidency and would, this time, actually run. Trump was asked if he worried that his publicly confrontational style would affect his political prospects. He retorted instantly with a reference to the Central Park Five. “I think it will help me,” he said. “I think people are tired of politically correct. I just attacked the Central Park Five settlement. Who’s going to do that?” The biographer was shocked by what he heard. “His insensitivity and inability to adjust to reality is sometimes shocking,” D’Antonio said of Trump. “But I don’t think that he is necessarily interested in reality as others experience it or as it’s determined by the courts. “There have been few cases of injustice that are as clear and profound as this one is, but he’s not able to consider that.” Salaam, who said he had been scarred for life by his experiences in prison, also felt insulted. But it was the announcement last June that Trump had finally decided to run for president that was, in a way, more alarming. “To see that he has not changed his position of being a hateful person, to see that he has not changed his position of inciting people, to see that he’s still the same person and in many ways he has perfected his sense of being that number-one inciter, you know, I was scared,” Salaam said. He was unsurprised that Trump currently leads polling averages by nearly 20 points in South Carolina, a state that votes for the Republican nomination on Saturday and where only last year the Confederate flag was withdrawn from the state house grounds. (A survey released this week suggests 70% of Trump’s supporters in south Carolina believe that decision was wrong and 38% of his supporters wish the south had won the civil war.) “I thought for a moment: What would this country look like with Donald Trump as being a president? That’s a scary thing,” Salaam said. “That’s a very scary thing.” What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"This article examines the Central Park Five case and its aftermath, arguing that Donald Trump's intervention in the case, including placing full-page newspaper advertisements calling for the reinstatement of the death penalty, contributed to divisive populism which has fueled Trump's later political career. The Central Park Five were a group of African-American and Hispanic teenagers wrongly convicted of the brutal rape of a white woman in New York, convictions which were later overturned due to DNA evidence. Critics argue that Trump's advertisement played a role in securing the teens' conviction by inciting racial tensions.

As well as flagship fashion outlets, the area boasts one of the city's best department stores, Mitsukoshi (4-6-16 Chuo Dori). The real treat here, as at many Tokyo department stores, is the fantastic basement-level food hall (\\"depachika\\"). For the complete Mitsukoshi experience, there's an ever bigger store in Nihombashi. The \\"Electric Town\\" of Akihabara is tech-head's heaven. Next door is Matsuya, another big department store, and while you're in the area don't miss the Sony Building (5-3-1 Ginza, Chuo-ku). Your inner games geek won't be able to resist the entire floor devoted to the PlayStation. If you've ever wondered where Tokyo teenagers buy their wacky cyber-goth manga-inspired attire, the answer is Takeshita-Dori, a narrow street in Harajuku. On Sundays the street fills with fashion-conscious teens, dressed to impress. For the less adventurous, but more discerning shopper, Harajuku's main thoroughfare, Omotesando is lined with elegant boutiques, including Louis Vuitton, Prada and Loveless (3-17-11 Minami-Aoyama). Looking unlike any shop you've seen before, Loveless has three floors of hip Japanese clothing and a basement decked out like the dungeon of some deranged medieval aristocrat. Harajuku is also home to six-floor Kiddy Land (6-1-9 Jingu-mae), one of the city's best toy stores, with a huge selection of Hello Kitty products. The area around Shibuya Station is a buzzing epicenter of shopping activity. Among its highlights are Tokyu Hands (Takashimaya Times Square, 5-24-2 Sendagaya), a department store that sells everything you could ever need, and plenty of stuff you had no idea even existed (electrically heated pilllows anyone?). A Bathing Ape (1 - Rise Bld. 13-17 Udagawa-Cho) offers funky T-shirts and trainers in an art gallery-style space, and Mandarake (Shibuya Beam B2 31-2 Udagawacho) is the place to satisfy your manga cravings, should you have any. For more manga, and a glimpse into the future, you'll want to go to Akihabara. Also known as Electric Town, Akihabara is a district of electronics stores clad in illuminated signs. Visit after dark for the full \\"Blade Runner\\" experience. Yodobashi Camera sells everything from next generation cell phones to cameras that aren't yet available outside Japan. For something more sedate, Daikanyama is a refined area popular with in-the-know fashionistas, while Jimbocho is the city's used-book quarter. Marunouchi was once a drab business district but is fast becoming the city's hottest shopping area. Shin-Marunouchi (just opposite the Marunouchi exit of Tokyo Stations) is a huge building, with the lowest seven floors devoted to chic shopping. The basement \\"depachika\\" is a feast for foodies. Tokyo International Forum (5-1 Marunouchi 3-chome, Chiyoda-ku) is a vast space used for art exhibitions and as a concert hall.

Question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: The drama begins in an asylum in Whitby, England. A mysterious patient escapes from his cell and intrudes upon a small party hosted by Dr. Seward, referring to the guest of honorâCount Draculaâas \\"Master.\\" Moments later he insists he does not know the Count and is led back to his cell. In conversation, it emerges the Count is sensitive to sunlight, has only recently arrived from abroad, and that Seward's fiancee Lucy finds him fascinating. Dr. Van Helsing comes to consult on the case, and manages to hypnotize the patient, so he recounts in flashback events in Transylvania, including an attack by Dracula's brides.     Denholm Elliott and Susan George Lucy, meanwhile, greets her old friend Mina Harker, who is distraught over the disappearance of her husband, Jonathan. She is puzzled when Dracula insists that Harker left unharmed months ago. Later, the mysterious patient catches sight of Mina and calls her by name. He is the missing Jonathan Harker. Dracula visits Lucy at night, feeding on her blood and forcing the two doctors to perform a blood transfusion. Van Helsing recognizes the signs of a vampire attack, but at first refrains from explaining this to Seward. When he does, the English scientist balks, but later comes to suspect Count Dracula of being the vampire. Despite Helsing's efforts, Dracula controls Mrs. Weston to remove the garlic from Lucy's bed. Through Harker, they find out Dracula has attacked her. By the time they get back, it's too late, Lucy dies and begins turning into a vampire. Lucy is soon buried and Mina goes to pay her respects to her grave.

Here is a detailed explanation: 1. Subject: \\"The Emperor's every wish\\" - It is a proper subject, using the possessive form (\\"Emperor's\\") to indicate that the wishes belong to the Emperor.

I have a new situation: With my previous cell phone, in order to charge it I would have a plug the charger into the wall and the plug the cord into my phone to connect it to the electric source. With my new phone, I just place the phone into the charging dock and my phone is charge wirelessly.  But I can use this background: Charging an object by touching it with another charged object is called charging by conduction. By bringing a charged object into contact with an uncharged object, some electrons will migrate to even out the charge on both objects. Charging by conduction gives the previously uncharged object a permanent charge. An uncharged object can also be charged using a method called charging by induction . This process allows a change in charge without actually touching the charged and uncharged objects to each other. Imagine a negatively charged rod held near the knob, but not touching. If we place a finger on the knob, some of the electrons will escape into our body, instead of down the stem and into the leaves. When both our finger and the negatively charged rod are removed, the previously uncharged electroscope now has a slight positive charge. It was charged by induction. Notice that charging by induction causes the newly charged object to have the opposite charge as the originally charged object, while charging by conduction gives them both the same charge.  What is an answer for this question: Was my new cell phone being charge using induction or conduction? The answer to this question is:","output":"Your new cell phone is being charged using induction.  This is because wireless charging, as you described with your new phone and charging dock, works on the principle of electromagnetic induction. In this method, an electric current is generated in the phone's internal charging coil by a changing magnetic field produced by the dock's charging coil. The generated electric current then charges the phone's battery. There is no direct physical contact between the phone and the charging dock, which is a key characteristic of charging by induction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The ruins of Moore, Oklahoma, a town destructed for the fourth time in 14 years by a major tornado , are a reminder that current building codes  can't do much to prevent property destruction and loss of life, especially when a powerful tornado cuts through town. But the total death number can be reduced when people take shelter in underground storm bunkers and hardened safe rooms. The tornado that carved a path of destruction through Moore took 24 lives. Its winds were clocked at 400 kilometers per hour. With only 15 minutes' warning, residents fled town or took refuge in the firmest corners of their homes. The luckiest were able to climb into shelters or move to safe rooms.  In Moore those rooms saved lives. But at two schools destroyed by Monday's tornado, no such shelter was available. Leslie Chapman Henderson is CEO of a non-profit group called the Federal Alliance for Safe Homes. She's an advocate for tornado safe rooms.   \\"The safe room is an interior room of the home that has been reinforced and tested to withstand high wind. In fact, we've already heard of stories of survival of people who were in safe rooms, either above or below ground,\\" she said.  Better storm forecasts give people more time to react. But they need someplace safe to go. Buildings can be built to resist strong winds, but not like those in the F-5 tornado that touched down in Moore. Chapman Henderson says even the building codes that do exist are not widely adopted or enforced.  As its residents prepare to rebuild, Moore's mayor is pushing for an order to make safe rooms compulsory in all new construction. Similar proposals were made following each of the previous tornado strikes, but none were adopted. Question: According to Chapman Henderson, which of the following does she probably agree with? - Building codes make a difference in preventing property destruction. - If people take shelter in safe rooms, nobody will die. - It is urgent to build tornado safe rooms. - Safe rooms can be built only underground. The answer to this question is:","output":"It is urgent to build tornado safe rooms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I read this background article the other day: Carbon dioxide is the most significant long-lived greenhouse gas in Earth's atmosphere. Since the Industrial Revolution anthropogenic emissions – primarily from use of fossil fuels and deforestation – have rapidly increased its concentration in the atmosphere, leading to global warming.  Carbon dioxide also causes ocean acidification because it dissolves in water to form carbonic acid.  I am facing a new situation today: Milton has just discovered two new planets while looking through his telescope. Luckily, he has invented a device that allows him to analyze far away planets from the comfort of his own home. He boots up the device and discovers that while these two planets are very similar, planet A has much more carbon dioxide in its atmosphere than planet B. While looking through his telescope, he is also able to see that there is the same race of intelligent creatures on both planets. Milton plans to write to his local observatory about his discovery.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which planet probably has less trees? The answer to this question is:","output":"Planet A probably has less trees. Step 1: Understanding the link between trees and carbon dioxide Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and use it during the process of photosynthesis. This helps in reducing the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Step 2: Considering the difference in carbon dioxide levels between the two planets Planet A has much more carbon dioxide in its atmosphere than planet B. This indicates a higher concentration of the greenhouse gas on planet A. Step 3: Relating the level of carbon dioxide to the presence of trees If there are more trees on a planet, they will absorb more carbon dioxide, thus reducing its concentration in the atmosphere. As a result, a planet with less trees will likely have a higher concentration of carbon dioxide in its atmosphere. Step 4: Identifying the planet with less trees Since planet A has a higher concentration of carbon dioxide in its atmosphere than planet B, it can be inferred that planet A probably has less trees than planet B. This is because the presence of more trees on planet B has helped in reducing the carbon dioxide concentration in its atmosphere."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: In a race with national implications, Democrat Conor Lamb declared victory in a very close special congressional election held Tuesday in Pennsylvania. Officially, the race has not been called for Lamb, who holds a lead of 627 votes over Republican candidate Rick Saccone, a strong supporter of President Donald Trump. It’s possible Saccone and his supporters may request a recount, given the close vote. Even though Lamb’s apparent victory is narrow, the Pennsylvania result could broaden implications for Republicans looking to defend their congressional majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate in the November midterm elections. Lamb ran surprisingly strong in a district that Trump carried by nearly 20 points, campaigning as a moderate Democrat. “We fought to find common ground, and we found it, almost everywhere. Democrats, Republicans, independents — each of us, Americans,” Lamb told supporters early Wednesday. Saccone was not ready to concede the race. “We are going to fight all the way to the end. You know I never give up.” The Pennsylvania race follows Democratic victories late last year in Virginia and Alabama, fueled in large part by what some analysts see as an anti-Trump theme that continues to build. “The opposition to Donald Trump is as intense as I have seen since the last year of [Richard] Nixon’s presidency,\\" said University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato via Skype. “It is so intense, it is so hot, that it could result in a much bigger turnover than we think in the midterm elections to the Democrats and away from the Republicans.” Saccone cast himself as the president’s “wingman,” and Trump campaigned on his behalf at a rally last Saturday when Trump urged Republicans to get out and vote. “We want to keep the agenda, the make America great, going. You have got to get him in. This is a very important race,” Trump said. Democrats were thrilled with the result, while some Republicans saw the race as a “wake-up” call for what could be a devastating midterm in November. What is probably true about Rick Saccone? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - He hoped more republicans had come out to vote for him - not enough information - He wanted a recount - He was not ready to concede the race A:","output":"He was not ready to concede the race."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- It is perhaps the most iconic sports photograph ever taken. Captured at the medal ceremony for the men's 200 meters at the 1968 Mexico Olympics, U.S. sprinter Tommie Smith stands defiantly, head bowed, his black-gloved fist thrust into the thin air. Behind him fellow American John Carlos joins with his own Black Power salute, an act of defiance aimed at highlighting the segregation and racism burning back in their homeland. It was an act that scandalized the Olympics. Smith and Carlos were sent home in disgrace and banned from the Olympics for life. But they were treated as returning heroes by the black community for sacrificing their personal glory for the cause. History, too, has been kind to them. \\"I had known they had gone through with their plans when a voice in the crowd sang the","output":"national anthem,\\" recalls Australian athlete Peter Norman, who stood alongside Smith and Carlos on the podium, having won the silver medal for his country. The three men had discussed their intentions before the ceremony, and although Norman did not raise his fist, he supported his fellow athletes' protest by wearing an Olympic Project for Human Rights badge on his tracksuit – an act of solidarity that, back in Australia, would subject him to criticism and affect his own athletic career for years to come. As the last strains of the \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" faded away, the stadium was filled with a mix of cheers and boos, reflecting the divisive nature of the protest. For Smith and Carlos, it was a moment of vindication and empowerment, knowing that they had made a powerful statement on an international stage, at a time when racial tensions in the U.S. were at a boiling point. Their actions reverberated around the world, inspiring generations of activists and athletes to use their platforms to challenge injustice and inequality. Over the decades, the image of Smith and Carlos' raised fists has become synonymous with the fight for civil rights and social justice. While detractors saw it as an unpatriotic, political act that had no place at the Olympic Games, supporters lauded their bravery and willingness to take a stand for what they believed in. Today, more than 50 years since that seminal moment, the debate over the role of protest and activism in sports continues, fueled by the actions of athletes like Colin Kaepernick, who took a knee during the national anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality in the United States. And while the consequences faced by Smith and Carlos in 1968 were undoubtedly severe, they have since been acknowledged and celebrated for their courage and the impact their actions had on the civil rights movement. \\"I don't have any regrets about what we did,\\" Tommie Smith said years later. \\"It was a time in our lives when we had to make a stand, and we did it to the best of our ability.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Located along California's San Andreas Fault, the city of San Francisco is likely to take precautions(,) in the event of the next big earthquake. According to aNew York Timesreport, emergency planners in San Francisco are not only thinking of human evacuation(,) plans in the event of an earthquake, but also of how to care for pets during a natural disaster. Ideally, the planners will be able to train pet-disaster responders who work to evacuate dogs, cats and other household pets from the disaster site to one of the 125 temporary animal shelters that will be set up or, if the pet is injured, it will be brought to an emergency animal medical unit where there will be people on hand to tend to the pet's injury. The city's \\"no-pets-left-behind\\" policy results from the great number of pet deaths during the destruction of Hurricane Katrina. As emergency responders arrived to rescue people isolated in their homes during Katrina, hurricane victims were told that they could not take their pets along with them when evacuating; thus, many pet owners were forced to make the heart-breaking decision to save themselves while leaving their pets behind to perhaps meet their deaths. Since then, the U.S. has passed the Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act of 2006, allocating federal funds for animal disaster planning projects. Yet, not all counties are as progressive as San Francisco has been in the effort to protect pets in the event of a natural disaster. Pets are after all, a large part of San Francisco's population -- overnumbering the number of school age children in the city.

US Marines end command in Iraq after 7 years; Biden visits Baghdad Saturday, January 23rd 2010, 4:15 PM RAMADI, Iraq - The U.S. Marines marked the end of nearly seven years in Iraq on Saturday by handing the Army their command of Anbar province, once one of the war's fiercest battlefields but now a centerpiece of U.S.-Iraqi cooperation. The changing of the guard - overseen by military brass and some of Anbar's influential Sunni sheiks - signals the start of an accelerated drawdown of American troops as the U.S. increasingly shifts its focus to the war in Afghanistan. American commanders are trumpeting security gains in places such as the western Anbar province as a sign that their partnership with Iraqi security forces is working, and that the local troops can keep the country safe. But fears are growing about a possible resurgence in sectarian tensions - fed by the Shiite-dominated government's plans to blacklist more than 500 parliamentary candidates over suspected links to Saddam Hussein's regime. In Baghdad, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden met with Iraq's leaders Saturday to try to alleviate the pressures. While he kept expectations of a breakthrough low - telling reporters after a meeting with President Jalal Talabani it was up to the Iraqis, not him, to resolve the issue - his visit alone underscored Washington's concern. The White House worries the bans could raise questions over the fairness of the March 7 parliamentary election, which is seen as an important step in the American pullout timetable and a way to break political stalemates over key issues such as dividing Iraq's oil revenue. \\"I am confident that Iraq's leaders are seized with this problem and are working to find a just solution,\\" Biden said during his visit. The Marines formally handed over U.S. responsibility for Sunni-dominated Anbar, Iraq's largest province, to the Army during a ceremony at a base in Ramadi, the scene of some of the war's most intense fighting. Overall control of the province shifted from the U.S. military to Iraq in September 2008, but the U.S. continues to provide support for Iraqi forces. Iraqi and American color guards stood together at attention as both countries' national anthems were played by a U.S. military band. As many as 25,000 Marines were in Iraq at the peak of the fighting, mostly in Anbar province. Fewer than 3,000 remain. All but a handful of those will ship out in a matter of weeks. The Marines' extended stay in Anbar went against the grain of the Corps' usual role as a fighting force designed to quickly seize territory and then turn it over to the Army to maintain control from fixed bases. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"The US Marines concluded their nearly seven-year mission in Iraq by transferring command of Anbar province to the Army, marking the beginning of an expedited drawdown of American troops and increased focus on the war in Afghanistan.

Marco, who I had already made turn 180 degrees to drive back to the truck, gave me that look of disapproval when I want to do something totally unreasonable like impulse buy citrus fruit that we can’t keep. “What are we going to do with these?” He questioned. I wasn’t sure. I wanted to taste them, I wanted to photograph them. And maybe I could even squeeze some of them into our tiny bag to take home. “It won’t be a waste, I’ll give the rest away!” I reasoned. He just shook his head, giving in. I bought them, a big grin on my face.

HDMI out is a term used to denote the output of the HDMI data stream typically from a computing or media device. HDMI, stands for High-Definition Multimedia Interface, is an interface that enables the transmission of high-quality video and audio data between devices. For example, if you have a DVD player with an HDMI out port, you can connect it to a TV or monitor with an HDMI in port, so the video and audio from the DVD player can be displayed and heard on the TV or monitor. This connection ensures that no quality is lost from the source (DVD player) to the destination (TV or monitor).

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: In this article, I’ll address a real mainstay of modern medicine: laboratory tests that require drawing blood. This is sometimes referred to as “checking labs,” “doing bloodwork,” or even “checking blood.” Most older adults have been through this. For instance, it’s pretty much impossible to be hospitalized without having bloodwork done, and it’s part of most emergency room care. Such testing is also often done as part of an annual exam, or “complete physical.” Last but not least, blood testing is usually — although not always — very helpful when it comes to evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults. Fatigued and experiencing low energy? We should perhaps check for anemia and thyroid problems, among other things. Confused and delirious? Bloodwork can help us check on an older person’s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more. Like much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it’s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person’s health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults. Historically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it’s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health. In fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (And then, keep it in your personal health record!) This way, if you ever have questions about your health, or need to see a different doctor, you’ll be able to quickly access this useful information about yourself. In this article, I’m going to list and briefly explain the blood tests that are most commonly used, for the primary medical care of older...

Given the below context:  Stereolab's music is politically and philosophically charged. Dave Heaton of PopMatters said that the group \\"[uses] lyrics to convey ideas while using them for the pleasurable way the words sound.\\" The lyrics of the 2006 compilation Fab Four Suture, contains themes of war, governments that suppress freedom, and \\"the powerlessness that everyday people feel in the face of it all\\", in contrast to \\"humans [working] together, [treating] each other like people, and [pushing] for governments that would do the same.\\" Lætitia Sadier, who writes the group's lyrics, was influenced by both the Situationist philosophy Society of the Spectacle by Marxist theorist Guy Debord, and her anger towards the Iraq War. The Surrealist, as well as the Situationist cultural and political movements were also influences, as stated by Sadier and Gane in a 1999 Salon interview.Critics have seen Marxist allusions in the band's lyrics, and have gone so far as to call the band members themselves Marxist. Music journalist Simon Reynolds commented that Sadier's lyrics tend to lean towards Marxist social commentary rather than \\"affairs of the heart\\". The 1994 single \\"Ping Pong\\" has been put forward as evidence in regard to these alleged views. In the song, Sadier sings \\"about capitalism's cruel cycles of slump and recovery\\" with lyrics that constitute \\"a plainspoken explanation of one of the central tenets of Marxian economic analysis\\" (said critics Reynolds and Stewart Mason, respectively).Band members have resisted attempts to link the group and its music to Marxism. In a 1999 interview, Gane stated that \\"none of us are Marxists ... I've never even read Marx.\\" Gane said that although Sadier's lyrics touch on political topics, they do not cross the line into \\"sloganeering\\". Sadier also said that she had read very little Marx. In contrast, Cornelius Castoriadis, a radical political philosopher but strong critic of Marxism, has been cited as a marking influence in Sadier's thinking.

What is the answer to this question? law related to inter caste marriage in india?","output":"In India, inter-caste marriages have historically faced societal backlash, mainly due to deeply rooted caste systems and traditions. However, recognizing the need to uplift socially backward communities and foster social harmony, the Indian Government introduced and implemented numerous laws to protect and support inter-caste couples. The primary laws related to inter-caste marriage in India include: 1. The Special Marriage Act, 1954: The Special Marriage Act was enacted to provide a special form of marriage for people who wish to marry outside the customs and rituals of their religion or caste. This Act allows any Indian citizen, irrespective of religion, caste, or creed, to marry under a civil ceremony. The Act also permits inter-religious marriages. Some of the essential conditions for a marriage under this Act comprise: - Both parties must be Indian citizens. - Neither party should have a living spouse at the time of the marriage. - Both parties must be at least 21 years old (for males) and 18 years old (for females). - The parties must give their consent to the marriage, free from fraud, force, or undue influence. 2. The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955: While the Hindu Marriage Act primarily deals with marriages within the Hindu community, Section 5 of the Act details specific conditions for a valid marriage. Among various conditions, the Act states that the parties should not be sapindas (closely-related) and not fall within the prohibited degree of relationships unless the regional customs or traditions recognize such relationships as valid for marriages. This provision indirectly allows inter-caste marriages within the Hindu community. 3. The Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955 (formerly The Untouchability (Offences) Act, 1955): The Act aims to prevent and eliminate the practice of untouchability by laying down specific provisions and punishments for offenses relating to untouchability. This law indirectly supports inter-caste marriages by penalizing the discrimination against lower castes, often the target of prejudice in inter-caste marriages. 4. The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989: This Act specifically protects the Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST), vulnerable to various forms of exploitation and atrocities. Under this law, any individual who promotes or forces someone to marry an SC/ST person with the objective of dominating and exploiting that individual may be punished. This Act illustrates the Indian Government's commitment to ensure the upliftment and protection of backward communities that often face challenges in the context of inter-caste marriages. 5. State-Specific Laws and Incentives: Various state governments in India provide incentives, financial or otherwise, to promote inter-caste marriages among their citizens. The financial incentives generally include a one-time lump sum payment to the couple, while some states may also provide additional benefits such as housing or education support. Despite the legal framework and measures, inter-caste marriages still face numerous challenges in India. However, these laws are an essential step to break down the rigid caste system barriers and promote social harmony in the country. As public awareness and education improve, it is hoped that societal acceptance of inter-caste marriages will continue to grow, and the role of the laws in this process will remain crucial."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Police in the Kenyan border town of Mandera said the attackers - thought to belong to al-Shabab - used explosives during the overnight attack. The main target appeared to be a guesthouse in the north-eastern town. It is the latest in a spate of deadly attacks targeting Christians in the mainly Muslim region. Pro-Shabab media outlets say the latest incident \\"killed Christian Kenyans\\" who were not from the local area. The dead included 10 people who had travelled to Mandera to stage performances in schools relating to books on the curriculum, the Daily Nation newspaper reported. Earlier this month, al-Shabab militants killed six people in an attack the group said was aimed at forcing Christians out of the area. Analysis: Abdullahi Abdi, BBC Somali service, Kenya Mandera borders Somalia, making it vulnerable to attacks from militants based there. The militants usually cross the porous border, carrying out deadly attacks on civilians and security agents before fleeing back. Muslims in the north east increasingly see al-Shabab as a threat to their own interests and are making a concerted effort to improve relations with Christians living there. Many of the Christians are skilled workers from other parts of Kenya, making a vital contribution to hospitals and schools. The north east is one of Kenya's poorest areas and, if they are driven out, public services will worsen. Al-Shabab, based in Somalia, is affiliated to al-Qaeda. The group has been at war with Kenya ever since Kenyan forces entered Somalia in October 2011 in an effort to crush them. Kenyan troops are now part of the African Union mission in Somalia. The militants have lost control of most Somali towns and cities in recent years but still control rural areas in southern and central Somalia.","output":"Suspected al-Shabab militants attacked a guesthouse in the Kenyan border town of Mandera, killing at least 12, primarily targeting non-local Christians as part of their ongoing campaign to drive them out of the predominantly Muslim region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"The girl in the music video for \\"Take on Me\\" by Norwegian synth-pop band A-ha is actress and model Bunty Bailey. Born on May 23, 1964, in England, Bailey was a professional dancer in the early 1980s, which led her to work with choreographer Arlene Phillips. This connection proved to be essential in Bailey landing her role in A-ha's iconic music video. \\"Take on Me\\" was a groundbreaking music video directed by Steve Barron in 1985 and is regarded as one of the most memorable videos in pop music history. It combines live-action with an animation technique known as rotoscoping, which involves tracing over live-action film footage frame by frame to create an animated look. In the video, Bunty Bailey plays the role of the main female character who falls in love with the lead singer Morten Harket. The storyline in the music video revolves around a budding romance between the Bunty Bailey's character and Morten Harket, whose comic book character comes to life. Their interaction starts with Bailey sitting at a cafe, sipping coffee while reading a comic book featuring a racing event. Morten Harket, as the main character of the comic, catches her attention and magically pulls her into his animated world. They embark on a whirlwind adventure, running from antagonists, and trying to make their way back to the real world. In the end, they are reunited in live-action, signifying the triumph of love. The \\"Take on Me\\" music video became an instant classic when it was released, winning multiple awards, including six MTV Video Music Awards in 1986. The video is often praised for its innovative combination of animation and live-action, as well as its engaging storyline. It played a significant role in boosting the popularity of the song, propelling A-ha to international fame. As for Bunty Bailey, following the release of the \\"Take on Me\\" video, she starred in the music video for A-ha's \\"The Sun Always Shines on T.V.,\\" another critically acclaimed video that continued the storyline from \\"Take on Me.\\" Bailey continued to work in entertainment as a model, actress, and dancer throughout the 1980s, working closely with the British dance troupe, Hot Gossip. In the years that followed, Bailey took a step back from the limelight but continued to work as a fitness instructor and volunteered for various charities. She occasionally appeared in reunion events and interviews related to A-ha and the music video, celebrating its lasting impact on popular culture. Overall, Bunty Bailey's essential role in the iconic \\"Take on Me\\" music video made her an unforgettable part of 1980s pop culture history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Output:","output":"To understand the effect of sediment not dissolving in water on smaller rocks moving around, let's break down the process step by step: 1. Wind or water breaks small pieces off of a rock. 2. The wind or water deposits tiny rocks (as a result of step 1). 3. The rocks become known as sediment (as a result of step 2). 4. The layers of sediment are pressed together by other layers of sediment on top. 5. Minerals from the rocks in the sediment dissolve. 6. Minerals glue the sediment together into a single rock. Now let's analyze the question: What is the effect of sediment not dissolving in water on smaller rocks moving around? If the sediment does not dissolve in water (step 5), it would prevent the minerals from gluing the sediment together into a single rock (step 6). This means that the layers of sediment would not be bonded together. The question asks about the effect of this event on smaller rocks moving around. Since the sediment not dissolving would not cause smaller rocks to move around (step 1 & 2) in the first place, there is no causal relationship between the two events.

I’m sitting at the airport on a Sunday morning waiting for my flight to Las Vegas for the now-annual pilgrimage to the NamesCon conference. A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me.  The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem. Question: When did the cab driver have enough money to only work 1 job? Options:  A. during a jackpot win  B. before winning a jackpot  C. after winning a jackpot  D. not enough information  === The correct answer is","output":"C. after winning a jackpot"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Zimmerman's wife depicted him as a man she has never seen angry. His father said he was a truthful man who had long been concerned with helping others. And his mother said he had organized a campaign to \\"get justice\\" for a homeless man who had been beaten in Sanford, as well as mentoring a 14-year-old African-American boy from a dangerous Orlando neighborhood. Zimmerman has acknowledged killing Martin during an encounter in his Sanford neighborhood, saying he shot in self-defense. This case has attracted national attention and sparked a widespread debate about racial profiling, gun control, and self-defense laws in the United States. As Zimmerman's personal life and character gain more attention, there remains a deep divide within the country over whether his actions that fateful night were justified or not. During the bond hearing, Zimmerman's family members testified to his character, painting a picture of a caring and compassionate individual, giving examples of his community involvement and concerns for the safety of those around him. The campaign to help the homeless man in Sanford that his mother mentioned showcases his dedication to fighting for justice, while his work mentoring a young African American boy highlights the hypocrisy of claims that he held racial biases. Yet, despite these claims by his relatives, there remain many who doubt Zimmerman's version of events and argue that the tragic death of Trayvon Martin was due not to self-defense but rather an act of aggression and prejudice on Zimmerman's part. Critics point to the multiple 911 calls he made during the incident, when he was specifically told not to follow Martin, but chose to do so anyway. As this case progresses through the legal system, more details and information about both Zimmerman and Martin will surely come to light, offering a more in-depth understanding of the events that transpired that night. However, as the public and media pore over these complexities, it is important to remember that the central issue of the case remains whether or not Zimmerman acted within the confines of the law when he shot and killed Trayvon Martin. The nation watches with bated breath as the justice system works to determine the answer to this critical question."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Sometimes, the scale needs to be zeroed out to be accurate. This can be done in two ways, depending on the scale you have. If you have an analog scale, press down on the scale with your hand and then lift up. The dial should level out to zero.  If it doesn't, use the turn wheel, usually located at the bottom of the scale or near the dial, to move the dial of the scale to zero while it's resting. Test it again to ensure it is at the right place. If you have a digital scale, follow the same procedure as with an analog except the balancing will be done with a digital button instead of a turn wheel. One way to check the accuracy of your bathroom scale is to test an object that you already know the weight of. It needs to be large enough to register on your scale but small enough that you can carry it to the scale. Try something like a new, unopened bag of flour or sugar. These generally are five to ten pounds and should be a consistent weight.  The weight of the paper or plastic bag these things come in shouldn't mess with the weight. If the flour or sugar comes in a heavy sack or metal container, you won't get an accurate reading and you should try another object. You can also try hand weights. The weight of these objects will be written on the side. Test to see if they are the weight they say they are. Another way that a scale may be inaccurate is across multiple weigh ins. Take an object you know the weight of, such as a hand weight or bag of sugar. Place it on the scale and note the weight. Take the object off and let the scale return to zero. Place the object on the scale again. Note the weight again. Repeat this at least five times to make sure that the scale in consistent over multiple weigh ins. You can weigh the object more if you get inconsistent results. Just make sure you do it an odd number of times so you can't have split results. Another way to make sure that a scale is accurate is to check the weight of two objects together. This will typically give you a larger amount of pounds, which will help test the scale at a higher level. It will also test the accuracy of the scale with an uneven weight distribution, which can be helpful for when you weigh yourself, since sometimes you might not stand with your weight 100% balanced.  Place one object on the scale. Note the weight. Take it off and let the scale even back out. Place another object on the scale and note its weight. Take it off and let the scale even back out. Now, place the two objects on the scale together. Note the combined weight. Add together the weight of the objects and see if it matches the weight the scale told you of them together. If it matches, the scale is accurate. If it doesn't, try it again and see if it is off by the same number. If it is, it might be that your scale is always off by that amount. You can also try stepping on the scale alone, noting the weight, and then stepping on the scale with an object that weighs X amount of pounds, like a 5 pound dumbbell or a 1 pound bag of flour. Then, check to see if the weight goes up by the exact amount that you are holding. If it does, then the scale is accurate.  For example, if you step on the scale and it says 145, then it should go up to 150 when you step on again while holding a 5 pound dumbbell. A scale can be affected by the surface it sits on. The best surface for a scale is a hard surface such as a flat bathroom or kitchen floor. It may be cushioned too much by carpet or other soft surfaces, which can make the scale off balance and give you inaccurate readings. Weight an object or yourself in the location you have your scale. Clear the scale and then move it to a different, more stable location. Weigh the same object again. The object should weigh the same. If it doesn't, one of the locations is causing inaccurate readings. Do a test with an object of known weight to see which one is accurate. Try to keep the scale in the same place every day. This way, even if the scale is slightly off, you should be getting the same error each day. This means that any weight you gain or lose, despite the number not being exactly correct, will still be how much you have gained or lost since your starting point was always the same. Summary:","output":"The article provides detailed information on how to properly zero out and test the accuracy of both analog and digital scales, suggesting using objects with known weights, testing multiple weigh-ins for consistency, checking the weight of combined objects, ensuring the scale is on a hard and flat surface, and maintaining the scale's location for consistent readings."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Analyzing the question: The question asks where geese invading a secure installation will be spotted first. We have to determine which of the given options is most likely the place where geese would be noticed first during an invasion. 2. Evaluating the options:    a. Fly: This option is an action that geese can perform, but it doesn't indicate a specific location in which they might be spotted.    b. Group together: This option refers to the geese gathering in a cluster or group, which could happen at any location. Therefore, it doesn't provide a clear answer to the question.    c.

Input: Abstract: Lysine acetylation is a key mechanism that regulates chromatin structure; aberrant acetylation levels have been linked to the development of several diseases. Acetyl-lysine modifications create docking sites for bromodomains, which are small interaction modules found on diverse proteins, some of which have a key role in the acetylation-dependent assembly of transcriptional regulator complexes. These complexes can then initiate transcriptional programmes that result in phenotypic changes. The recent discovery of potent and highly specific inhibitors for the BET (bromodomain and extra-terminal) family of bromodomains has stimulated intensive research activity in diverse therapeutic areas, particularly in oncology, where BET proteins regulate the expression of key oncogenes and anti-apoptotic proteins.

FINAL EXAM  Question 1. What Plasmodium organism is Raymond G. Chambers an envoy for? The answer to this question is:","output":"Raymond G. Chambers is not an envoy for a Plasmodium organism. Rather, he is the United Nations Secretary-General's Special Envoy for Health in Agenda 2030 and for Malaria. The confusion may arise from the fact that Plasmodium species are the parasitic organisms responsible for malaria, a disease that Mr. Chambers has been dedicatedly working towards combating. Raymond G. Chambers is a philanthropist, humanitarian, and successful entrepreneur who has focused on eliminating malaria and improving global health as a central part of his work. As the Special Envoy for Health in Agenda 2030 and for Malaria, his role is to mobilize resources, generate political will, and foster partnerships among different stakeholders, including governments, private sector organizations, NGOs, and multilateral institutions, in order to achieve the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal related to health (SDG 3). Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites belonging to the genus Plasmodium, which are transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. There are five Plasmodium species known to infect humans, including Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale (with two subspecies: P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri), Plasmodium malariae, and Plasmodium knowlesi. Among these, P. falciparum and P. vivax are the most prevalent and cause the greatest number of malaria cases, with P. falciparum being responsible for the majority of severe cases and fatalities. Raymond G. Chambers' involvement in fighting malaria goes back to 2008 when he was first appointed as the UN Secretary-General's Special Envoy for Malaria. Under his leadership, the international community made significant strides in reducing the disease burden worldwide. He played a crucial role in mobilizing resources for the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, and for other organizations working to eliminate malaria. In 2015, Chambers' mandate as the Special Envoy for Malaria was expanded to include all health-related issues covered in the United Nations' Agenda 2030 and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This broader role allows him to work on various health issues beyond malaria, such as maternal and child health, infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, and universal health coverage, which are tackled under SDG 3: \\"Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.\\" In summary, Raymond G. Chambers is not an envoy for a specific Plasmodium organism but a dedicated leader committed to ending malaria, improving global health, and attaining the health-related Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations. His work encompasses raising awareness, mobilizing resources, and fostering collaborative efforts among different stakeholders to reduce the burden and suffering caused by this devastating disease, ultimately aiming for a world free from malaria."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Movie title: Steel Context: John Henry Irons (Shaquille O'Neal) is a weapons designer who invents high-tech laser guns, protective armor, and sonic sound cannons for the United States military. One soldier, Nathaniel Burke (Judd Nelson), decides to show just what Irons' weapons can do and sets one of Irons' sonic cannons at the highest power setting, firing the device at an abandoned building. However, the weapon backfires and destroys the building the team is situated in. Irons' partner, Susan \\"Sparky\\" Sparks (Annabeth Gish), is crushed by a large slab of concrete in the ensuing chaos. In court, Irons reveals Burke's role in the incident and Burke is dismissed from the military. Because his weapons resulted in Sparks becoming a paraplegic, Irons resigns in disgust. Meanwhile, Burke hatches a plot to sell Irons' weapons to criminal gangs, recruiting a video arcade manager to help him carry out this deed. Irons witnesses a bank robbery organized by gang members wielding Burke's modified guns; they escape before he can interrogate them on where they obtained the weapons. The gang does not tell Irons anything when confronted directly in their hideout. Irons visits Sparks in a veteran's hospital and takes her to his own assembled laboratory, where he hopes he and Sparks can create weapons needed to combat the criminals. With the help of Uncle Joe (Richard Roundtree), they forge a suit of armor and the weaponry necessary for Irons to carry out his war on crime and become the vigilante \\"Steel\\". However, during his crusade against crime, Irons is pursued by the cops and is forced to return to his lair. The next night, the robbers arrange to rob another bank.

Please answer the following question: Article: Apple a day may poison children Children who eat an apple or pear a day may be exceeding  the pesticide  safety limit because of remains on the fruit,according to research. Using data of the British Department of Environment on pesticides on fruit collected from supermarkets,scientists thought that each day some children would get a poisonous level of pesticides. The research,published on Sunday,says the government repeatedly claims that the levels of pesticide are safe because,instead of measuring individual apples, researchers buy 10,crush them and take an average reading to see if they are safe. This is the internationally agreed method of checking remains. But government figures show that the pesticide is not averagely spread across the batch ,and one or two apples could contain 90% or more of the pesticide in the batch. It used mathematical modeling to measure exposure  to pesticides for children aged between 18 months and four years old. The pesticides involved can destroy children's hormones and some are suspected  of causing cancer. The good news for British fruit growers is that samples grown in this country had lower _ level than imported fruit,so buying home-produced fruit will reduce the danger,said Emily Diamand,one of the Earth's senior food researchers and one of the authors of the report. Question: Which of the following is NOT true? Yes or no, is the answer \\"For safety,we had better not import apples from Britain.\\"?

I could do things the FBI thought impossible. I could memorize fingerprints. The nearby agencies, including local offices of federal agencies that had their own labs, came to me for help. One day in a trial a new-hatched defence attorney tried to make me seem neglectful because I hadn't sent the prints from the crime scene to the FBI for verification. The FBI will not look at prints that have already been identified locally. I tried to get that across to him. Finally I said, “Sir, you don't understand. I don't ask the FBI for help. The FBI asks me for help.” The courtroom went dead silent. The lawyer choked a bit and looked frantically at the judge, who knew me quite well. The judge slowly nodded. The lawyer choked a few more times, said, “No further questions,” and returned to his seat. I was the only person in the five-state area in which the silver burglar was hitting who got him on fingerprint evidence. He never left fingerprint evidence . . . except when he did. Every other police agency quit looking, because his MO was unmistakable. We didn't. A detective got prints from a bamboo tree he had used to climb in a window, and I got several prints from items he had handled inside the house. After the trial he was being led back to the jail and I was walking down the hall. He stopped and said, “I want to talk to that lady.” The bailiff told him he couldn't talk to the witness, but I said I wanted to hear what he had to say. He said, “Lady, you're the smartest cop I ever saw, and I hope to God I never see you again.” I think that was the best compliment I ever got. I have other accomplishments.

The one person who, by his interference, could have settled all doubts was debarred by circumstances from interfering in the matter.  Wykham Delandre had quarrelled with his sister--or perhaps it was that she had quarrelled with him--and they were on terms not merely of armed neutrality but of bitter hatred.  The quarrel had been antecedent to Margaret going to Brent's Rock.  She and Wykham had almost come to blows.  There had certainly been threats on one side and on the other; and in the end Wykham, overcome with passion, had ordered his sister to leave his house.  She had risen straightway, and, without waiting to pack up even her own personal belongings, had walked out of the house.  On the threshold she had paused for a moment to hurl a bitter threat at Wykham that he would rue in shame and despair to the last hour of his life his act of that day.  Some weeks had since passed; and it was understood in the neighbourhood that Margaret had gone to London, when she suddenly appeared driving out with Geoffrey Brent, and the entire neighbourhood knew before nightfall that she had taken up her abode at the Rock.  It was no subject of surprise that Brent had come back unexpectedly, for such was his usual custom.  Even his own servants never knew when to expect him, for there was a private door, of which he alone had the key, by which he sometimes entered without anyone in the house being aware of his coming.  This was his usual method of appearing after a long absence.

This statement merely describes the outcome of their quarrel, not the reason or cause behind it. From the passage, it is clear that Margaret and Wykham had a bitter quarrel, and they were on terms of armed neutrality and hatred. However, the specific topic or issue that caused their quarrel is not mentioned in the text. The passage also mentions the aftermath of their disagreement, with Margaret leaving Wykham's house and eventually ending up at Brent's Rock with Geoffrey Brent. While it is evident that the quarrel had a lasting impact on their relationship, without further information, we cannot pinpoint the exact cause of their dispute."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Rodney George Laver  (born 9 August 1938) is an Australian former tennis player widely regarded as one of the greatest in the history of the sport. He was the No. 1 ranked professional from 1964 to 1970, spanning four years before and three years after the start of the Open Era in 1968. He also was the No. 1 ranked amateur in 1961-62. Laver's 200 singles titles are the most in tennis history. Laver had a long-running, friendly rivalry with Ken Rosewall between 1963, when he started out as a pro, and 1976, when both were semi-retired from the main tour. Including tournaments and one-night stands, they played over 130 matches, all of them as professionals, with some results from the barnstorming pro tours lost or badly recorded. Overall a match score of 79-63 in favour of Laver can be documented.  Against the older Pancho Gonzales, whom he played 1964 to 1970 on the pro tour, Laver had a lead of 35-19 or 38-21, depending on the source.  Laver had another, even longer rivalry with his fellow Queenslander Roy Emerson. They met first on the senior amateur tour in 1958 and dominated the amateur circuit until 1962, before Laver turned pro. When open tennis arrived in 1968, Emerson joined the pro tour, and had many new battles with Laver. Overall the score is 49-18 in favour of Laver, with 7-2 in major Grand Slam tournaments.  Laver had also many battles with Lew Hoad in his first years on the pro circuit 1963-1966. Although he lost the first 8 matches in January 1963, Laver later in the year began to turn around their rivalry, and until 1966, he had built a 38-21 lead. Against Arthur Ashe, Laver had a head-to-head lead of 21-3, winning all of the first 18 matches. Ashe's first win came in 1974, when Laver was 35. Another younger rival in the Open Era was John Newcombe, whom Laver led 16-5 in their head-to-head score.

Please answer this question: which are the 10 lost tribes of israel?","output":"The ten lost tribes of Israel refer to the ten of the twelve tribes of ancient Israel who were said to have been exiled after the Assyrian conquest around 722 BCE. They are commonly believed to have dispersed throughout the ancient world, assimilating into the populations of various regions, and their descendants eventually lost sense of their original Israelite identity. However, historians and biblical scholars have debated the veracity of this account and the fate of the ten tribes, as well as searched for tangible evidence to determine their existence. Nevertheless, according to the Hebrew Bible, the twelve tribes of Israel were descended from the twelve sons of the patriarch Jacob (who was also called Israel). Here is a list of the ten tribes considered \\"lost\\": 1. Reuben: This tribe was named after the firstborn son of Jacob and his wife Leah. The Tribe of Reuben occupied the area south of the Sea of Galilee at the northern region of the Dead Sea. 2. Simeon: The Tribe of Simeon, led by Jacob's second son with Leah, was originally located within the territory of Judah in the southern part of Israel. 3. Dan: Named after Jacob's fifth son, borne by Bilhah, Rachel's maid, the Tribe of Dan initially settled in the northwest coast of Israel, near the modern city of Tel Aviv, before eventually migrating north to avoid the Philistines. 4. Naphtali: Named after Jacob's sixth son with Bilhah, the Tribe of Naphtali settled in the northern part of Canaan, near the Sea of Galilee, and was known for its agricultural richness. 5. Gad: The Tribe of Gad descended from Jacob's seventh son, borne by Zilpah, Leah's maid. They settled on the eastern side of the Jordan River in modern-day Jordan, known for its grazing lands. 6. Asher: The Tribe of Asher stemmed from Jacob's eighth son with Zilpah. This tribe inhabited an area along the Mediterranean coast of present-day Lebanon, which today includes cities such as Tyre and Sidon. 7. Issachar: Named after Jacob's ninth son and fifth son with Leah, the Tribe of Issachar was located in the northern region of Israel's Jezreel Valley, famous for its fertile soil. 8. Zebulun: Descended from the tenth son of Jacob and Leah, the Tribe of Zebulun lived along the Mediterranean coast, south of the Phoenician city of Tyre. 9. Ephraim: The Tribe of Ephraim was established by one of the two sons of Joseph, Jacob's firstborn son with his wife Rachel. The tribe settled in a central part of Canaan, comprising the southern section of the present-day West Bank. 10. Manasseh: The other half of the tribe founded by Joseph's sons, the Tribe of Manasseh settled in the northern part of the West Bank and east of the Jordan River. The tribe itself was later divided into two half-tribes, preserving the original count of twelve tribes. Throughout history, various groups have claimed descent from the lost tribes of Israel, sometimes as a means of legitimizing their ancestry or religious status. The two remaining tribes, Judah and Benjamin, made up the southern Kingdom of Judah, which was later conquered by the Babylonians. However, unlike the ten lost tribes, the descendants of Judah and Benjamin maintained their Israelite identity, eventually became known as the Jewish people, and their history is better documented. The search for the ten lost tribes remains an area of fascination for historians, archaeologists, and religious scholars."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

It was first arranged for the 1983/84 season. Team event was first time held in 1999/00 season. The FIS race director is a Norwegian ex ski jumper and ex world record holder Lasse Ottesen.  - The Nordic combined events have been contested at the Winter Olympic Games since 1924. The first competition involved 18 km cross-country skiing, followed by ski jumping. Whoever earned the most points from both competitions won the event. At the 1952 Winter Olympics, the ski jumping was held first, followed by 18 km cross-country skiing. The cross-country skiing portion was reduced to 15 km at the 1956 Winter Olympics. The ski jumping styles would change over the years as well, from the Kongsberger technique after World War I to the Daescher technique in the 1950s to the current V-style from 1985 onwards. The cross-country skiing technique would switch from classical to freestyle for all competitions beginning in 1985, but the biggest change would occur at the 1988 Winter Olympics in the scoring with the Gundersen method, meaning the 15 km cross country portion would go from an interval start race to a pursuit race, so that whoever crossed the finish line first won the event. The team event with a 3 x 10 km cross country relay started at the 1988 Winter Olympics, changing to the current 4 x 5 km cross-country relay at the 1998 Winter Olympics. The 7.5 km sprint event was added at the 2002 Winter Olympics. Nordic combined remains a men's only event as of the 2010 Winter Olympics. For the 2010 Winter Games, the 15 km Individual Gundersen which consisted of 2 jumps from the normal hill followed by 15 km cross country will be replaced by a 10 km individual normal hill event which will consist of one jump from the individual normal hill following by 10 km of cross country using the Gundersen system while the 7.5 km sprint will be replaced by the 10 km individual large hill event.  - Nordic combined is a winter sport in which athletes compete in cross-country skiing and ski jumping. Nordic combined at the Winter Olympics and the FIS Nordic Combined World Cup are ongoing.  - Ski jumping is a form of Nordic skiing in which athletes descend a specially constructed takeoff ramp (known as the \\"inrun\\"), jump from the end of it (the \\"table\\") with as much power as they can generate, and \\"fly\\" as far as possible down a steeply sloped hill. Points are awarded for distance and style by five judges, with competition sanctioned by the International Ski Federation (FIS). To enable the athletes (who are known as \\"ski jumpers\\") to effectively glide such long distances and land safely, the skis they use are considerably wider and longer than their cross-country and alpine skiing counterparts. Ski jumping is predominantly a winter sport and has been part of the Winter Olympic Games since its inception in 1924 for men and since 2014 for women. Since 1954 it is possible to ski jump in summer on artificial surfaces made from plastic. Along with cross-country skiing, ski jumping is one of two sports which form the Nordic combined discipline. Holmenkollbakken in Oslo is the holy place of this sport, which is most popular in Austria, Germany, Finland, Japan, Norway, Poland and Slovenia.  - Tsugiharu Ogiwara (   Ogiwara Tsugiharu ) ( born 20 December 1969 ) is a Japanese nordic combined skier who competed from 1994 to 1998 . He won the 4 x 5 km team event at the 1995 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in Thunder Bay , Ontario . Ogiwara 's best individual finish at the Winter Olympics was 6th at Nagano in 1998 . He had two individual career victories ( 1993 : 15 km individual , 1998 : 7.5 km sprint ) . He is the twin brother of Kenji Ogiwara , a fellow Japanese Nordic combined athlete .  - A winter sport or winter activity is a recreational activity or sport which is played during cold weather months. Most such sports are variations of skiing, ice skating and sledding. Traditionally such sports were only played in cold areas during winter, but artificial snow and artificial ice allow more flexibility. Artificial ice can be used to provide ice rinks for ice skating, ice hockey and bandy in a milder climate.

Q: Four letters picked without replacement from aahgh. Give prob of sequence agga. A:","output":"To find the probability of the sequence \\"agga\\" from the set \\"aahgh\\", we'll need to calculate the probability of each letter being drawn at each step and then multiply the probabilities together.  Step 1: Probability of drawing 'a' first There are 2 'a's in the set, and a total of 5 letters. So the probability is 2/5. Step 2: Probability of drawing 'g' second After removing the first 'a', there are now 4 letters remaining in the set ('ahgh'), with 2 'g's. So the probability is 2/4, which simplifies to 1/2. Step 3: Probability of drawing 'g' third After removing 'g', there are 3 letters remaining ('ahg'), with 1 'g'. So the probability is 1/3. Step 4: Probability of drawing 'a' fourth After removing the second 'g', there are 2 letters remaining ('ah'), with 1 'a'. So the probability is 1/2.

Expansion quickly peaked however, and the European powers who had carved up the New World set about testing each other in dynastic conflicts and colonial rivalry. The English were the main rivals of the Dutch on the high seas, and there were several wars between the two in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1665–1667 the Dutch sailed up the River Medway and sank the British fleet moored there. The 18th century saw Amsterdam grow into the foremost financial center in the world, but the seeds of decline had already been planted. When the English colonies in New England rose up in revolt against the British, they found ready Ailies in the Dutch. From their colonies in the Caribbean they sent caches of arms and ammunition. The British were furious and went to war in 1780, destroying the Dutch navy and signaling a sudden decline in power and influence from which the Netherlands never recovered. Trade suffered to such an extent that in 1791 the VOC went into liquidation. In the latter part of the century there were anti-Orange demonstrations by pro-French factions in the country, and in 1795 Napoleon Bonaparte took the Netherlands in his epic march across Europe. Under the yoke of another foreign power, and with trade at an all time low, the Golden Age was truly dead. The Return of the House of Orange Napoleon installed his brother Louis as King of Holland and he chose to take the fine Town Hall on Dam Square as his palace — now the Koninklijk Palace. But only four years later he fled the city after civil disturbances broke out when he raised taxes. When Napoleon's bubble burst and French power began to wane, William of Orange emerged from exile and was proclaimed king in 1813. Amsterdam had to work its way out of economic decline, but throughout the 19th century the city grew steadily. Industrialization changed the city. With the building of the Central Station at the end of the century, Amsterdam turned its back on its seafaring past and looked towards the mechanical age for its future. The station was built over the old harbor wall and some of the oldest canals in the city center were filled in to allow better access to motorized vehicles. Dam Square was landlocked for the first time in its history.

It's happening in a club.      A few hours later, there's a line of young people waiting at the entrance of Sound Museum Vision. It's almost 2 a.m. Things are just getting started and the patrons seem eager to pay the cover charge, get inside, and be consumed by the booming music below.      Aside from its physical location beneath the streets of Tokyo, the dance club has an underground feel. That's because Japan's entire dance culture has been forced to hide in the shadows amid stepped-up enforcement of a law from 1948 that forbids dancing after midnight or 1 a.m. in bars, clubs, and most other public venues.      Last week, Japanese lawmakers voted to lift the notorious dancing ban, which goes back to the American occupation after World War II. Back then, \\"dance halls\\" were often a front for prostitution, which was rampant at the time in the poverty-stricken nation.      Times have changed. Japan is now one of the world's largest economies with a high standard of living and vibrant nightlife. Opponents of the dancing ban call it obsolete and oppressive.      The law sat in the books collecting dust, and police looked the other way for decades, allowing Japan's dance scene to thrive in the 70s, 80s and 90s. But a string of high profile drug cases involving celebrities, and a deadly club brawl in 2010 in Osaka that killed a 22-year-old student, led to a surge of arrests from club raids.

MUST WATCH Japanese rock inspires spellbinding dance 03:23      'War on Dance'      In what became known as \\"Japan's War on Dance,\\" police used the no dancing laws to arrest DJs and haul club patrons to police stations, where they were often tested for drugs.      The new law says club seating areas can't be too dark, which is an attempt to discourage crime. They need to be lit more than 10 lux, similar to a movie theater with the lights on. Darker clubs will be governed under the old law and will have stricter rules for after-midnight operation. Until changes take effect next year, after hours dancing is still against the law.      \\"It's crazy. Don't make any sense. It's a dance club,\\" says musician and dancer David Escoe. \\"But I still get down. I'm usually in VIP. The key is you have to know the owner.\\"      Many Japanese bars and nightclubs put up \\"no dancing\\" signs, which are often a shock to first-time visitors to Japan. The signs are an attempt to avoid problems with police, who consider dance clubs magnets for violence, drug abuse, and sex crimes.      Daizo Murata, the owner of Sound Museum VISION and other Tokyo clubs, says he spent 21 days in jail for violating Japan's dancing ban and has operated in constant fear of police raids for years.      \\"I worry about it every day. I've been worrying for 30 years,\\" Murata says.      Steps to dance freedom      Murata is part of a movement demanding change. A high profile raid and arrest at the Osaka club \\"NOON\\" in 2012 sparked the movement involving a wide range of club supporters, encompassing not only musicians and DJs, but also lawyers and politicians.      The Let's Dance Petition Committee, initiated by world-known musician Ryuichi Sakamoto and others, gathered more than 150,000 signatures urging lawmakers to abolish the dancing ban in 2013. The non-partisan parliamentarians league was formed to submit the revision to the parliament in 2014. The draft was modified by the police and government before being ratified last week.      There is political will to push the law through quickly. Heading toward the 2020 Olympic Games, many feel Tokyo cannot simply remain a city that goes dark after midnight. Politicians from various parties have pushed to lift the ban.      In Tokyo, around 50 clubs and 300 DJ's are forming a Dance Entertainment Association (DEA) and plan to collaborate for events and discuss issues like club safety and security.      \\"Now, the artists and DJs will be able work safely,\\" Murata says. \\"More great artists will be able to come here.\\" ||||| The ban forbids public dancing unless the venue has a licence, and even licenced premises have to stop all dancing by midnight.      The Footloose-esque law was put into place after the Second World War, in an effort to crack down on dancehalls that were often a hotbed for prostitution.      Since then, Japan has developed into a thriving and highly developed nation - yet the archaic dancing ban remained on the books for decades.      Despite the law, dancing, even after midnight, was tolerated in the second half of the 20th Century, with police turning a blind eye to the hard-to-enforce law that was routinely being broken.      However, into the 21st Century, a string of celebrity drug scandals and nightclub brawls led to a crackdown, with club raids once again becoming common.      Fortunately, Japan's night owls will soon be able to party without fear. A campaign led by world-famous Japanese musician Ryuichi Sakamoto, calling for the abolition of the ban, gained 150,000 signatures.      The new law was finally ratified last week, and will come into force next year. Until then, late-night dancing will remain illegal.      The lifting of the ban was partly due to the upcoming 2020 Olympics, with the government taking the necessary steps to make sure visitors have as much fun (and spend as much money) as they can during their stay.      Japan may finally be catching up with the rest of the world, but that other highly-developed democracy, Sweden, is still sticking to its own dancing ban.      'Spontaneous dancing' is illegal in Sweden, and owners of bars, clubs and pubs without a special dancing licence face fines if their patrons decide to take to the floor.      In March this year, politicians voted in the Riksdag to lift the bizarre ban - but it failed to pass, and Swedes still need government permission if they fancy a dance. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Japan has finally lifted its notorious 1948 dancing ban that forbids dancing after midnight or 1 a.m. in bars, clubs, and most other public venues.

There are five new \\"reactions\\" buttons joining the like symbol, TechCrunch reports: love, haha, wow, sad, and angry, all accessible when you hover over the like button. Users will now see a count for the most popular reactions chosen for each post on their news feeds (click on any one of the icons to get the total count for all reactions). In two blog posts announcing Wednesday's rollout, a Facebook product manager explains how to use the different reactions and how the tool will help the site \\"learn how the different Reactions should be weighted differently by News Feed to do a better job of showing everyone the stories they most want to see.\\" She notes they researched for a year or so to see which reactions people would most use, checking out surveys, comments, and virtual stickers to find the most common emotions. Those emotions had to resonate with people around the globe: USA Today notes the five reactions were universally understood, and a sixth—a \\"yay\\"—was dumped because it wasn't. TechCrunch—which points out Facebook basically copied the emotions concept from the Path sharing site—notes that \\"standardizing emotions\\" could prove helpful when communicating across languages. For instance, a user may know enough of a foreign language to read a post but not be able to write a fluent comment in response. These new reactions would therefore allow users to give more nuanced feedback on posts where a generic like doesn't feel right—the sad reaction seems more appropriate in response to a death, for instance. (How will Facebook public shaming change with the new reactions?) Expand this summary.","output":"Recently, Facebook introduced an extension to its famous 'like' button by adding five new \\"reactions\\" to the platform: love, haha, wow, sad, and angry. The addition of these new reactions aims to give users more options to express their emotions as a response to a certain post, rather than just a simple thumbs-up. Users will now see a count for the most popular reactions for each post on their newsfeeds, allowing them to view the total count for all reactions. To access these new reactions, users only need to hover over the existing like button to display the expanded set of response options. In two blog posts announcing the launch of this new feature, a Facebook product manager explains how to use the different reactions and how the tool will help the social network to improve their algorithms that personalize the content shown to users. By monitoring how users interact with the new reactions, Facebook's News Feed will be able to better weigh the different types of content and provide users with the stories that are most relevant to their interests. It is noteworthy that Facebook conducted thorough research for about a year in order to identify which reactions users would most likely utilize. The process involved checking out polls, analyzing comments to find widely used expressions, and examining how people around the world used virtual stickers to express emotions. The reactions that were ultimately chosen had to be universally understood by people from different cultures and backgrounds. It was essential to maintain clarity and simplicity in their design. One example of this is the removal of a sixth reaction, \\"yay,\\" which was deemed to be too similar to the existing \\"love\\" reaction and might have caused confusion among users. In a broader context, standardizing emotions through these new Facebook reactions could prove useful when communicating across different languages. Users might be able to understand a post written in a foreign language, but might find it difficult to express their feelings in a written response. However, by using the new reactions, users can now offer more nuanced feedback to the content they come across on the platform. These updated response options address a long-coveted desire among Facebook users for a \\"dislike\\" button, which the social media giant never implemented. The new reactions offer users a more appropriate way of reacting to posts that require a more sensitive approach, such as expressing sadness upon hearing the news of a loved one's passing. It remains to be seen how these new reaction buttons will impact user interactions, but overall, they represent Facebook's commitment to adapting its platform to better serve the needs and preferences of its users."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Tareek Arnold, with his wrists shackled behind his back, was about to be taken downtown for arraignment Tuesday night when he shoved the cop escorting him out of the 32nd Precinct stationhouse in Harlem and made a run for it, police said. A surveillance video from a nearby business showed the tattooed terror running down the block after his 7:30 p.m. escape, with a uniformed officer and a detective a few seconds behind him. Arnold ran into a building on St. Nicholas Ave. near W. 134th St. — just two blocks from the stationhouse — but soon disappeared, police said. A second surveillance video showed he left the address soon afterward. His whereabouts remained a mystery Wednesday. Longtime family friends said they didn’t know where Arnold went. “I haven’t heard from him,” said one, who did not want to give her name. “I’m just finding out what’s going on through the news. “I’m worried and I’m hoping that nothing bad happens to him,” the woman said. “I don’t want nothing to happen to him, but I know how police can be.\\" Arnold, who is considered dangerous, was charged with shooting a rival on Seventh Ave. near 140th St. on June 8.

Tareek Arnold, 23, who had been arrested for attempted murder, escaped from police custody in Harlem Tuesday night, police said. Arnold, who has an infant son, according to family friends, had been arrested six times before he was taken into custody Tuesday. His most recent arrest had been on March 19, when he was charged with driving a car through Harlem without a license, officials said.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"No, these two questions are not inquiring about the same information. Each question asks about a completely different topic. 1. The first question is about interest-only loans in real estate, and if they are okay for an investment property. Interest-only loans are when you only pay the interest portion of a loan each month, without paying off any of the principal (the main amount you borrowed). This can be a useful option for some investors, as it helps keep the monthly payments low. However, it's important to know that only paying the interest means you won't own the property completely after the loan term. Whether this option is right for you depends on your financial plan and long-term investment goals. 2. The second question asks about successful startups that came from India and have been adopted in the US and Europe. These startups are businesses that started in India and have become popular and successful in other countries too. For example, a company called Zomato, which helps people find restaurants and order food online, was started in India and is now popular in many countries, including the US and Europe.

This is exciting.Yet,on the other hand,competition breezes a pragmatic  attitude.People choose to learn things that are useful,and do things that are profitable.Today's college education is also affected by this general sense of utilitarianism  . Many colleges students choose Business,Law not Computer Programming as their majors convinced that these professions are where the big money is.It is not unusual to see the college students taking a part--time job as a warm--up for the real battle.I often see my friends taking GRE tests,working on English or computer certificates and taking the driving tests to get a license.Well,I have nothing against being practical.As the competition in the job market gets more and more severe,students do have reasons to be practical. However,we should never forget that college education is much more than skill training.Just imagine,if your utilitarianism becomes the main trend on campus,leaving no space for the cultivation  of students' minds,or development of their soul.We will see university is training out well--trained spiritless working machines.If utilitarianism controls society,we will see people lost in the money--making adventures;we will see humanity losing their grace and dignity,and that,would be disastrous.I'd like to think society as encouraging and people regard profit or fame only as a horse that pulls the courage.Yet without the driver picking direction,the courage would go straight and may even end out in a dangerous situation. A certificate may give you some advantages,but not broad horizons,positive attitudes and personal integrity ,which are the wealth you cannot acquire through any  quick fixed  way.

As always, lighting was minimal (as opposed to Bee's workshop out behind the house, which was flooded with fluorescents). A bank of TV sets and computer monitors covered one whole wall, arranged on a precarious system of metal shelves that Bee had installed herself. A low, flat coffee table squatted below the glowing displays, supporting three keyboards, a bank of video editing tools and four different phone carriages. Bee sat in her accustomed place - in the midst of a pile of cushions on the floor, fiddling with a mouse in one hand and typing on one of the keyboards while she talked quietly into her headset. Paul and Chloe didn't bother to knock as they came in - Bee already knew they were there. Paul glanced at one of the screens mounted on the wall. Its display, divided into four quadrants, showed various images from inside the house, including the front door they'd just come through and the stairs they'd just climbed. The screen next to it - which Paul himself had salvaged from a bar on Duval that'd recently renovated into a finedining restaurant - showed images from four other cameras that covered the house's exterior. Nothing happened within fifty yards of their Crew's house that Bee didn't see, and if she had her way, that omniscience would soon extend to cover the entire island. \\"So, Bee, how goes Project Big Brother?\\" Paul asked. \\"I wish you wouldn't call it that,\\" she replied. \\"Sorry, but I have to call it something.\\" \\"You could call it something nice.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Background: Skyhooks were an Australian rock band formed in Melbourne in March 1973 by mainstays Greg Macainsh on bass guitar and backing vocals, and Imants \\"Freddie\\" Strauks on drums. They were soon joined by Bob \\"Bongo\\" Starkie on guitar and backing vocals, and Red Symons on guitar, vocals and keyboards; Graeme \\"Shirley\\" Strachan became lead vocalist in March 1974. Described as a glam rock band, because of flamboyant costumes and make-up, Skyhooks addressed teenage issues including buying drugs \\"Carlton (Lygon Street Limbo)\\", suburban sex \\"Balwyn Calling\\", the gay scene \\"Toorak Cowboy\\" and loss of girlfriends \\"Somewhere in Sydney\\" by namechecking Australian locales. Context: Greg Macainsh and Imants \\"Freddie\\" Strauks both attended Norwood High School in the Melbourne suburb of Ringwood and formed Spare Parts in 1966 with Macainsh on bass guitar and Strauks on lead vocals. Spare Parts was followed by Sound Pump in 1968, Macainsh formed Reuben Tice in Eltham, with Tony Williams on vocals. By 1970 Macainsh was back with Strauks, now on drums, first in Claptrap and by 1971 in Frame which had Graeme \\"Shirley\\" Strachan as lead vocalist. Frame also included Pat O'Brien on guitar and Cynthio Ooms on guitar. Strachan had befriended Strauks earlier--he sang with Strauks on the way to parties--and was asked to join Claptrap which was renamed as Frame. Strachan stayed in Frame for about 18 months but left for a career in carpentry and a hobby of surfing in Phillip Island.  Skyhooks formed in March 1973 in Melbourne with Steve Hill on vocals (ex-Lillee), Peter Ingliss on guitar (The Captain Matchbox Whoopee Band), Macainsh on bass guitar and backing vocals, Peter Starkie on guitar and backing vocals (Lipp & the Double Dekker Brothers) and Strauks on drums and backing vocals. The name, Skyhooks, came from a fictional organisation in the 1956 film Earth vs. the Flying Saucers. Their first gig was on 16 April 1973 at St Jude's Church hall in Carlton. At a later gig, former Daddy Cool frontman, Ross Wilson was playing in his group Mighty Kong with Skyhooks as a support act. Wilson was impressed with the fledgling band and signed Macainsh to a publishing deal. In August, Bob \\"Bongo\\" Starkie (Mary Jane Union) on guitar replaced his older brother Peter (later in Jo Jo Zep & The Falcons) and Ingliss was replaced by Red Symons (Scumbag) on guitar, vocals and keyboards. The two new members added a touch of theatre and humour to the band's visual presence. By late 1973, Wilson had convinced Michael Gudinski to sign the band to his booking agency, Australian Entertainment Exchange, and eventually to Gudinski's label, Mushroom Records.  Skyhooks gained a cult following around Melbourne including university intelligentsia and pub rockers, but a poorly received show at the January 1974 Sunbury Pop Festival saw the group booed off stage. Two tracks from their live set, \\"Hey What's the Matter?\\" and \\"Love on the Radio\\" appeared on Mushroom's Highlights of Sunbury '74. After seeing his performance on TV, Hill phoned Macainsh and resigned. To replace Hill, in March, Macainsh recruited occasional singer, surfer and carpenter Strachan from his Frame era. Strachan had been dubbed \\"Shirley\\" by fellow surfers due to his curly blond hair a la Shirley Temple. Question: Did they have any good shows in that period? Answer:","output":"During the early period of Skyhooks, the band experienced a mix of success and struggles. Upon their formation in 1973, the band had managed to gain a cult following in the Melbourne area, and this included university intelligentsia and pub rockers, suggesting that they had developed a local fan base and played good shows within the local scene. Their theatrical stage presence, along with the use of glam rock costumes and make-up, added an aura of charm and uniqueness to their performances. This was further complemented by their approach to address social issues in their songs, appealing to a section of the youth audience. However, not all their shows were well-received. Their performance at the Sunbury Pop Festival in January 1974 was notably disappointing, as the group was booed off stage. This incident demonstrated a turning point for the band, leading to a series of changes in their lineup and, eventually, their music and presence. The recruitment of Graeme \\"Shirley\\" Strachan in March 1974 injected a fresh energy into Skyhooks. His history with the group's founders, as well as his occasional singing stints, made him a natural fit for the band. While specific records of shows during this period may not be readily accessible, the band's combination of unique aesthetics, music addressing teenage concerns, and their evolving lineup all point to potential for memorable and enjoyable performances during this early stage of their existence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:The Nursing Times conducted an online poll of nearly 600 of its readers on issues such as staffing, patient safety and NHS culture. Three-quarters had witnessed what they considered \\"poor\\" care over the past 12 months, the survey found. The government said it had increased staffing and hundreds of new nurses were still being taken on by the NHS. The survey comes ahead of a public inquiry report into care failings at Mid Staffordshire Foundation Trust. More than 57% of those asked in the survey described their ward or unit as sometimes or always \\"dangerously understaffed\\". Of those who had witnessed poor care, nearly 30% said they had seen it happen regularly. Some 85% of those who worked on general wards said the patient to nurse ratio was eight or more to one, and 44% said the ratio was 10 or more to one. Howard Catton, head of policy at the Royal College of Nursing, told the BBC the ratio level in many hospitals was unacceptable. \\"We should have clear national guidance on what safe staffing levels are. One registered nurse to eight patients is getting into very risky territory, it should be around one in five. \\"We have ratios for our kids in nurseries...why can't we have them for our patients in hospitals? \\"Cutting nurses will have a negative impact on the quality of care that's provided and in the worse case scenario yes it can lead to untimely deaths.\\" Unison head of nursing Gail Adams told the Nursing Times the findings of the survey echoed their own research on the issue, carried out in 2012. \\"At the time less than 10% of nurses said they could deliver safe, dignified, compassionate care all of the time.\\" Low morale Joyce Robins, co-director of Patient Concern, told BBC Radio 5 Live nurses felt they could not keep their patients safe because there were not enough staff. \\"The amount of work they are expected to do goes up all the time but staffing levels don't rise,\\" she said. \\"You hear all these stories that nurses don't care anymore but really it's that nurses can't care because they don't have time because there aren't enough of them.\\" Also speaking to Radio Five Live Jenni Middleton, editor of the Nursing Times, said morale was very low amongst nurses. \\"If you've gone into that job to care and to look after people and to not be able to do that is heartbreaking and very very stressful because you feel you're incapable of doing what you've been trained to do because you don't have the resources to back you up.\\" Prime Minister David Cameron has acknowledged the government still has a long way to go to raise standards across the NHS. Mr Cameron encouraged the idea of nurses checking on patients every hour, as part of a package of nursing measures in January. Some 31% of nurses on general wards in the survey said they were not aware of this being introduced where they worked. The issue of care standards will come to the fore again when the Francis report into the Mid Staffs Trust is published on Wednesday. Inquiry chairman Robert Francis QC will present the final report to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, before the minister makes a Commons statement. The Â£13m inquiry was set up after a Healthcare Commission report in 2009 found \\"appalling standards\\" of care. In response to the survey, the government said there were more clinical staff working in the NHS now than when it came to power in May 2010. About 2,500 new nurses started working in the NHS in October 2012 alone, it added.

Following Bandung, Nasser officially adopted the \\"positive neutralism\\" of Yugoslavian president Josip Broz Tito and Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru as a principal theme of Egyptian foreign policy regarding the Cold War. Nasser was welcomed by large crowds of people lining the streets of Cairo on his return to Egypt on 2 May and was widely heralded in the press for his achievements and leadership in the conference. Consequently, Nasser's prestige was greatly boosted as was his self-confidence and image. How did the Egyptian press react to Nasser's accomplishments?","output":"The Egyptian press reacted overwhelmingly positively to Nasser's accomplishments, particularly after the Bandung Conference in 1955. As Nasser officially adopted \\"positive neutralism\\" in response to the Cold War, he positioned Egypt as a nation that would no longer align with the superpowers of the United States or the Soviet Union. This stance earned Nasser significant praise and recognition, both in Egypt and internationally. Newspapers and journalists in Egypt widely covered Nasser's return from the conference and his adoption of positive neutralism. They portrayed him as a heroic figure, standing up for the rights and interests of his people and bolstering Egypt's sovereignty. Multiple Egyptian newspapers showered Nasser with praise, lauding his achievements, leadership, and vision for the nation's future. Egyptian press emphasized Nasser's role as a key participant in the conference and praised his speeches and diplomatic efforts to unite various nations under the non-aligned banner. Through this coverage, the press contributed to the construction of Nasser's image as a strong, pragmatic leader who played a crucial role in shaping the global political landscape. Upon his return to Cairo, Nasser was welcomed by thousands of Egyptians who lined the streets to cheer and celebrate him. This massive public display of support was amplified by the media, further highlighting the people's enthusiasm for Nasser's achievements and boosting his self-confidence. Moreover, the Egyptian press helped to consolidate the perception of Nasser as a pan-Arab leader, who championed the cause of anti-imperialism and national liberation throughout the Arab world. The media coverage of Nasser's diplomatic efforts and his unwavering vision of a united Arab front was instrumental in building his reputation as a driving force in the Arab nationalist movement. Egyptian newspapers also focused on Nasser's relationship with other prominent leaders at the conference, such as Yugoslavian president Josip Broz Tito and Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. His close association with these influential leaders in the non-aligned movement further validated his credentials as a key figure on the global stage. In conclusion, the Egyptian press played a crucial role in elevating Nasser's prestige and solidifying his image as a charismatic, visionary leader at the forefront of the non-aligned movement and Arab nationalism. By amplifying his accomplishments, articulating his policies, and celebrating his return from the groundbreaking Bandung Conference, the Egyptian media helped to cement Nasser's legacy as one of the most influential leaders in modern Egyptian history."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Berman and Company is a Washington , D.C. based public affairs and non-profit management firm founded by lawyer and former lobbyist Rick Berman . In addition to its public relations clients , Berman and Company runs several industry - funded non-profit organizations such as the Center for Consumer Freedom , the Center for Union Facts , and the Employment Policies Institute . The non-profits have worked on issues including obesity , health care , food safety , labor law , alcohol , and government regulation . The firm is known for campaigns that include aggressive advertising , opposition research , and online communications .  - The Employment Policies Institute is a fiscally conservative non-profit American think tank that conducts research on employment issues such as minimum wage and health care. It was established in 1991 and has been described as \\"a nonprofit research group that studies issues of entry-level employment.\\"  - Public relations (PR) is the practice of managing the spread of information between an individual or an organization (such as a business, government agency, or a nonprofit organization) and the public. Public relations may include an organization or individual gaining exposure to their audiences using topics of public interest and news items that do not require direct payment. This differentiates it from advertising as a form of marketing communications. Public relations is the idea of creating coverage for clients for free, rather than marketing or advertising. An example of good public relations would be generating an article featuring a client, rather than paying for the client to be advertised next to the article. The aim of public relations is to inform the public, prospective customers, investors, partners, employees, and other stakeholders and ultimately persuade them to maintain a certain view about the organization, its leadership, products, or political decisions. Public relations professionals typically work for PR and marketing firms, businesses and companies, government, government agencies and public officials as PIOs and nongovernmental organizations, and nonprofit organizations. Jobs central to public relations include account coordinator, account executive, account supervisor, and media relations manager.  - Public interest, according to the \\"Random House Dictionary\\", is \\"1. the welfare or well-being of the general public; commonwealth. 2. appeal or relevance to the general populace: a news story of public interest.\\"  - A think tank, policy institute, or research institute is an organization that performs research and advocacy concerning topics such as social policy, political strategy, economics, military, technology, and culture. Most policy institutes are non-profit organizations, which some countries such as the United States and Canada provide with tax exempt status. Other think tanks are funded by governments, advocacy groups, or businesses, or derive revenue from consulting or research work related to their projects.  - NeWS (Network extensible Window System) is a discontinued windowing system developed by Sun Microsystems in the mid-1980s. Originally known as \\"SunDew\\", its primary authors were James Gosling and David S. H. Rosenthal. The NeWS interpreter was based on PostScript (as was the later Display PostScript, although the two projects were otherwise unrelated) extending it to allow interaction and multiple \\"contexts\\" to support windows. Like PostScript, NeWS could be used as a complete programming language, but unlike PostScript, NeWS could be used to make complete interactive programs with mouse support and a GUI.  - A lawyer is a person who practices law, as an advocate, barrister, attorney, counselor or solicitor or chartered legal executive. Working as a lawyer involves the practical application of abstract legal theories and knowledge to solve specific individualized problems, or to advance the interests of those who hire lawyers to perform legal services.  - The Center for Union Facts (CUF) is an American interest group that is critical of labor unions. It is one of several advocacy and public relations groups founded by Richard Berman, whose Washington, D.C.-based public affairs firm, Berman and Company, specializes in research, communications and advertising.  - An advocate is a type of professional person in several different legal systems and it is also a commonly used \\"honorific\\" for remarkable lawyers, such as in \\"Adv. Sir Alberico Gentili\\". The broad equivalent in many English law-based jurisdictions can be a \\"barrister\\". However, in Scottish, South African, Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Scandinavian, Polish, South Asian and South American jurisdictions, advocate is also a word to indicate lawyers of superior classification.

Since they are at the ruined mill and one person wants to explore, I decide to continue the text by describing their exploration, discoveries, and the conversation between them. Step 3: Expand on the characters' actions and conversation. I expand on the characters' actions by having them explore the ruins and surroundings of the mill, while also developing their conversation about the place and its history.

So we began to explore the surroundings of the ruined mill, navigating through the overgrown vegetation and broken bricks. As we walked, we spotted remnants of old machinery, wondering about the history of this once-thriving mill. Our conversation flowed effortlessly as she shared her fascination with the past and her desire to learn more, while I added anecdotes of similar places I had visited before. We discovered a small creek nearby that we imagined once fueled the mill's waterwheel, producing energy for the entire operation. The sound of the rushing water added a sense of serenity to the area, further cementing its status as a perfect picnic spot. Through our exploration and conversation, our initial disappointment over not having a bag lunch was replaced with excitement for the adventures we were able to share. As we started making our way back to the car, we agreed that we would definitely return someday with a prepared lunch to enjoy among the history of the old mill. But for now, the Dairy Queen in Oak Falls would be just fine for today's sustenance and a fitting end to our spontaneous outing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Context: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis promised Thursday the Pentagon will \\"notify\\" Congress before any possible military action in Syria, where the U.S. is considering responding to a suspected chemical weapons attack.  \\"There will be notification to leadership, of course, prior to the attack,\\" Mattis said in his testimony at the House Armed Services Committee. \\"We will report to Congress. We will keep open lines of communication.\\"  But notably, Mattis did not indicate the Trump administration would seek congressional approval before the strike, which presumably would target the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Trump says the U.S. will soon launch \\"nice and new and smart\\" missiles in response to last week's suspected poison gas attack, which left scores dead in a rebel-held area. Trump blames Assad for the attack.  A U.S. attack is likely to upset a small but growing number of U.S. lawmakers who demand President Donald Trump first ask Congress to authorize any hostilities, citing the War Powers Resolution of 1973, a federal law intended to check the president's ability to wage war. U.S. presidents, both Republican and Democrat, have long argued they have legal authority to order airstrikes and other short-term military campaigns if those engagements fall short of the \\"hostilities\\" mentioned in the War Powers Resolution.  Additionally, U.S. presidents have cited a pair of authorizations by Congress following the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks as justification for the near-constant U.S. strikes on Islamic militants around the world.  The Trump administration has used those authorizations as justification for its current war in Syria. The U.S. has 2,000 troops in Syria, and helps lead an international coalition against Islamic State in Syria and neighboring Iraq.  The overwhelming majority of U.S. lawmakers have not publicly objected to the administration's legal rationale for those missions.

Title: Man of the Year Movie plot: This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (August 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams) is a comedian of a satirical talk show who is able to tap into people's frustrations with the sharply divided, special interest-driven political climate. Specifically, he makes fun of the American two-party system. During his warm-up act, an audience member suggests that he run for president. At first, Dobbs laughs off the idea, but following a popular groundswell of support, later announces on the air that he will stand as a candidate. Through his efforts, he gets on the ballot in 13 states and participates in one of the national debates with the Democratic incumbent, President Kellogg, and Republican U.S. Senator Mills. A parallel plot follows Eleanor Green (Laura Linney), who works at a voting machine company in California called Delacroy. According to a television commercial in the movie, the entire United States will be using Delacroy voting machines for the Presidential election. Shortly before the elections, Eleanor notices that the voting system does not work correctly and alerts the head of the company, James Hemmings (Rick Roberts) via e-mail. Initially, Dobbs approaches the campaign seriously â perhaps too seriously, to the chagrin of his staff, especially his manager Jack Menken (Christopher Walken). That turns around the night of the presidential debates, when, fed up with the other candidates' posturing, Dobbs shifts back into comedian mode, managing to keep the audience laughing and make serious points simultaneously. From then on, he resumes his showman persona, thoroughly shaking up the political landscape. Dobbs surges in polls after the debates, but remains a distant third to Kellogg and Mills. Election Day arrives, and polls show Dobbs at 17% with Kellogg and Mills tied in the 40s. Early returns show Kellogg beating Mills everywhere. Eleanor says...

She set him down on the hardwood floor and he clipped around like a fawn - - clip, clip -- looking through doorways and carefully eyeing us both. He was tiny but he was strong. He was muscular and sleek, like a miniature greyhound, and we both watched intently as he clipped around, soldiering things out and whining under his breath. Miss Tennessee looked at me and smiled and said: \\"Well honey? What do you think?\\" And I told her: \\"I love the little guy.\\" He was never really my dog. He was more like my step-dog, but together we named him Steve. We thought it was funny, giving a dog a man's name like that. But it fit, like Miss Tennessee, which I started just to tease her about being full-grown and long- legged and pretty, but in a tomboyish way that made it both absolutely ridiculous and absolutely plausible that she had ever been Miss Anything. It always made her swallow a grin. Steve's name, on the other hand, made it sound like he wasn't a dog at all, but this little man. Miss Tennessee often called him that: the little man. Steve liked me okay but he loved Miss Tennessee. With me it was man things. After he got snipped or when he was stung by bees, down there, in grass that came up to his chin, he would come sit by me, hoping I'd understand. With her, it was everything else. When she took a bath, he stood with his paws on the side of the tub, and when she went someplace he couldn't go he stood where he last saw her and waited. If she went into a store and left us together in the car, he stood with his paws on the dashboard, waiting and crying and looking at me like maybe I was to blame.

Terry asks his boss's wife Sylvia to his apartment after an office party and the two go to bed. Later, while he is in the bathroom, she hears screams outside and goes naked to the window. Seeing a man attacking a young woman, she opens the window and the assailant runs away. When the media report the murder of a young woman near Terry's flat that night, he thinks the police should know what Sylvia saw but, to protect her, claims he was at the bedroom window.  At a police lineup, neither he nor the victim Denise is able to pick out the attacker Carl. Despite the feeble evidence against him, Carl is put on trial for the assault and during the proceedings his lawyer proves that since Terry is short-sighted he could not have witnessed the incident. Carl goes free, leaving not only the police and the prosecution but also Denise and Sylvia aghast at Terry's ineptness. In the courtroom, Carl recognised Sylvia as the woman at the window. Desperate to warn her, Terry finds her at a ballet performance and tells her she must go to the police, but she refuses all further involvement. As he leaves, he sees Carl's distinctive truck parked outside and rushes in again. He is too late, however, for in the dark she has been stabbed fatally and dies in Terry's arms.  He takes refuge with Denise, who first seduces him and then offers him a chance to redeem himself. She wants revenge, and with him devises a plot to provoke Carl into another attack.

Options: - england - iowa - street corner - city - town  The answer is \\"town\\" because The answer is:","output":"\\"town\\" because the question describes a place where everybody knows everybody, which is a characteristic commonly associated with small towns. In small towns, people tend to know each other well, and a corner shop can become a local gathering place and center of activity. Step 1: Identify the type of place being described In the question, the corner shop is described as the epicenter of activity where everyone knows each other. This gives us a clue that the place is likely small and tight-knit. Step 2: Analyze the given options We are given five options: England, Iowa, street corner, city, and town. We can eliminate England and Iowa, as they are locations rather than characteristics of local communities. A street corner is a specific location and not an overall descriptor for a community. Step 3: Compare the characteristics of the remaining options with the description in the question The remaining options are city and town. Typically, cities are larger and more populated, making it less likely for everyone to know one another. Small towns generally feature a closer community with neighbors knowing each other on a more personal level.

Although this sentence provides information about the expansion of the original park and comments on its comparison to Disneyland, it does not clearly indicate whether expanding the park leads to Disneyland being incomparable to the original park solely due to the expansion.  Sentence 2 suggests that Disneyland cannot compare to the original park as it expanded to attract customers of all ages. This sentence seems to focus mainly on comparing Disneyland to the expanded areas of the original park. However, Sentence 1 states that the original park is not as fantastic as Disneyland, which appears to be a contradiction. Given the information provided in the two sentences, the first sentence does not directly establish if the second sentence is true because of the unclear nature of the comparison, the slight contradiction in describing the parks, and no information provided on if the expansion is the sole reason Disneyland cannot compare.

Write the answer: What name was given to the pre-decimal coin worth one- eighth of a pound?","output":"The pre-decimal coin that was worth one-eighth of a pound, or equivalent to two shillings and sixpence, was commonly known as the \\"florin.\\" However, there was another name for this coin, and that was the \\"half-crown.\\" Both names represent the same value and were used interchangeably before the implementation of the decimal currency system in 1971. The florin was first introduced in 1849 as part of the United Kingdom's gradual move towards decimalization of its currency. It was designed to be equivalent to one-tenth of a pound sterling at that time. This silver coin featured the portrait of Queen Victoria on the obverse and various designs on the reverse, illustrating the royal coat of arms, emblematic floral designs of England, Scotland, and Ireland, among others. Over time, the florin's design changed with the monarchs, and portraits of King Edward VII, King George V, King George VI, and Queen Elizabeth II appeared on these coins. On the other hand, the half-crown was an older coin, first minted in 1526 during the reign of King Henry VIII. It was made of silver and featured the portrait of the current monarch on one side. Throughout its existence, the half-crown saw changes in design for each monarch and alterations in the composition of metals used to produce the coin. The weight, size, and silver content of the half-crown varied over time, but its value as one-eighth of a pound sterling remained constant. Before decimalization, the British pound was subdivided into 20 shillings, with each shilling equivalent to 12 pence, making a total of 240 pence in a pound. The florin, worth two shillings and sixpence, was equal to 30 pence; since 30 divided by 240 equals one-eighth, the florin was effectively one-eighth of a pound. Following the Decimal Currency Act of 1969 and culminating in Decimal Day on February 15, 1971, the United Kingdom transitioned from the pounds, shillings, and pence system to the decimal currency system we use today. This change established a new denomination wherein one pound was equal to 100 pence. As part of this shift, the florin and half-crown ceased to be minted, and decimal coins such as the 10 pence and 50 pence coins took their place in British currency circulation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The chill of the January afternoon pierced her through, but it was fear, more than the cold, that made her limbs shake.

Could anyone on the palace wall have seen her walk over the Petit-Pont? Not Amalric. He was still in the south, the King having just appointed him seneschal for Beziers and the surrounding country. But he had so many agents in Paris and allies at court. Except for Agnes, all the servants in the Gobignon town house were loyal to him. His aunt, Queen Blanche, was forever praising him to all who would listen. If Nicolette were involved in scandal, the White Queen would be furious, and would see to it that word reached Amalric.

Jackie wants to go out on the boat to spend some time on the ocean, but Mark wants to lay out on the beach and relax. Since they can't agree, Jackie goes out on the boat alone while Mark stays behind on the beach.  and a hint : In coastal regions, sea breezes and land breezes can be important factors in a location's prevailing winds. The sea is warmed by the sun more slowly because of water's greater specific heat compared to land. As the temperature of the surface of the land rises, the land heats the air above it by conduction. The warm air is less dense than the surrounding environment and so it rises. This causes a pressure gradient of about 2 millibars from the ocean to the land. The cooler air above the sea, now with higher sea level pressure, flows inland into the lower pressure, creating a cooler breeze near the coast. When large-scale winds are calm, the strength of the sea breeze is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the land mass and the sea. If an offshore wind of 8 knots (15 km/h) exists, the sea breeze is not likely to develop.  Please answer this question : Is the air around Mark more or less dense than the air around Jackie?","output":"In the given situation, the air around Mark is less dense than the air around Jackie. This is because Mark is on the beach, where the land heats up more quickly due to its lower specific heat compared to water. Consequently, the air above the land gets heated by conduction and becomes less dense as it rises. On the other hand, Jackie is out on the boat in the ocean, where the water heats up more slowly and the air above the sea remains cooler and denser. The sea breeze, which is a cooler breeze near the coast, flows from the sea to the land due to a pressure gradient created by the higher pressure above the sea (cooler, denser air) and the lower pressure above the land (warmer, less dense air). In calm prevailing winds, the strength of the sea breeze is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the land and the sea.

Background: Arthur Asher Miller (October 17, 1915 - February 10, 2005) was an American playwright, essayist, and figure in twentieth-century American theater. Among his most popular plays are All My Sons (1947), Death of a Salesman (1949), The Crucible (1953) and A View from the Bridge (1955, revised 1956). He also wrote several screenplays and was most noted for his work on The Misfits (1961). The drama Death of a Salesman has been numbered on the short list of finest American plays in the 20th century alongside Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night and Tennessee Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire. Context: In 1940, Miller married Mary Grace Slattery. The couple had two children, Jane and Robert (born May 31, 1947). Miller was exempted from military service during World War II because of a high school football injury to his left kneecap. That same year his first play was produced; The Man Who Had All the Luck won the Theatre Guild's National Award. The play closed after four performances with disastrous reviews.  In 1947, Miller's play All My Sons, the writing of which had commenced in 1941, was a success on Broadway (earning him his first Tony Award, for Best Author) and his reputation as a playwright was established. Years later, in a 1994 interview with Ron Rifkin, Miller said that most contemporary critics regarded All My Sons as \\"a very depressing play in a time of great optimism\\" and that positive reviews from Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times had saved it from failure.  In 1948, Miller built a small studio in Roxbury, Connecticut. There, in less than a day, he wrote Act I of Death of a Salesman. Within six weeks, he completed the rest of the play, one of the classics of world theater. Death of a Salesman premiered on Broadway on February 10, 1949, at the Morosco Theatre, directed by Elia Kazan, and starring Lee J. Cobb as Willy Loman, Mildred Dunnock as Linda, Arthur Kennedy as Biff, and Cameron Mitchell as Happy. The play was commercially successful and critically acclaimed, winning a Tony Award for Best Author, the New York Drama Circle Critics' Award, and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. It was the first play to win all three of these major awards. The play was performed 742 times.  In 1949, Miller exchanged letters with Eugene O'Neill regarding Miller's production of All My Sons. O'Neill had sent Miller a congratulatory telegram; in response, he wrote a letter that consisted of a few paragraphs detailing his gratitude for the telegram, apologizing for not responding earlier, and inviting Eugene to the opening of Death of a Salesman. O'Neill replied, accepting the apology, but declining the invitation, explaining that his Parkinson's disease made it difficult to travel. He ended the letter with an invitation to Boston, a trip that never occurred. Question: Did he win any awards for his work?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, Arthur Miller won several awards for his work. His play \\"All My Sons\\" earned him his first Tony Award for Best Author in 1947, which also played a crucial role in establishing his reputation as a playwright. Miller's iconic play \\"Death of a Salesman\\" premiered on Broadway in 1949 and was a commercial success while receiving critical acclaim. \\"Death of a Salesman\\" won multiple awards, including the Tony Award for Best Author, the New York Drama Circle Critics' Award, and the prestigious Pulitzer Prize for Drama.

Were his living room walls peach or greige? It's pretty hard to tell just from the photos. When the convicted financier's New York duplex at 133 East 64th Street was put on sale last week to help pay investors that he swindled, everyone wanted a peek. The first look, offered by the Associated Press, showed muted grey-beige walls and rumpled pillows in the living room, a bare mattress in the bedroom, a tag hanging off of a leather bull's ear in the library, a trash can in the foreground of the kitchen, and cardboard packing boxes -- filled with wine --cluttering up the laundry room. Then Sotheby's International Realty announced it would be brokering the sale with a 9.9 million price tag. The high-end brokerage put out its own photos, featuring light-filled windows and warm peach-toned walls in the living room, glowing ceilings in the library and fresh flowers on all the coffee tables. See the photos from the AP and Sotheby's The photos show how different lenses, lighting, angles and post-production techniques can alter how a home looks and feels -- a subject I've talked about before. It also shows how two professional photographers armed with digital cameras, but with dissimilar mandates and time constraints, can produce photos that reveal very different messages about the home's owners. Mary Altaffer, the Associated Press photographer, says her assignment was to show how the Madoffs lived, as realistically as possible. Accompanied by a U.S. marshal, she had less than an hour to shoot the place, using a handheld Nikon camera with a wide lens and fill-in flash. The wide lens was to get as much detail in every photo as possible; the flash was to supplement the relatively gloomy morning light in rooms half-darkened by shades. Although Ms. Altaffer's hand is steadier and her equipment and technique more sophisticated than those of an amateur photographer, the result looks a lot like hastily-done snapshots of an apartment that was exited hastily. The AP's rules prohibit touch-ups: \\"I'm not allowed to color-correct or Photoshop,\\" says Ms. Altaffer. We asked professional photographers to comment on the shots taken for Sotheby's and the Associated Press: The flash of the AP photographer creates a brighter foreground, darker colors and grayer colors that makes the room more gloomy, which \\"goes along with the tone of their story.\\" \\"The color is just plain off on the Sotheby's images… the [AP] images have production flaws, but the whites seem white; in all the Sotheby's comparisons, the whites have [a] color cast.\\" On Sotheby's: \\"This shoot has better compositions. But the sky in the patio shot, which was color-enhanced post-production, \\"looks a little fake.\\" --Scott Van Dyke, Los Angeles \\"I would bet that the Sotheby's images are closer to what the eye would perceive, partly judging by cleaner-looking neutral colors.\\" --Alan Stoker, Iowa City, Iowa \\"It appears all the AP shots were done with ambient light which is not even and has many shadowy dark areas. The Sotheby's shots are all fairly evenly lit and nice and bright.\\" --Marian Kraus, Saint Charles, Ill. \\"The [AP photos'] on-camera flash tends to look cool or bluish.\\" By contrast, Travis Dubreuil had several hours to photograph the penthouse duplex with his Canon camera and semi-wide angle lens. His broker clients expected him to color-correct the photos and touch them up to minimize flaws. In fact, he says, the brokers attending the shoot fluffed up the living room pillows and threw a cream-colored scarf over the bedroom's bare mattress to simulate a bedspread; he later removed the mattress's telltale dimples using Photoshop. Photoshop was also useful to help layer multiple exposures of the library into one photo, which helped balance out the contrast between the bright windows and dark paneled walls (he used a tripod and a cable shutter release to ensure he'd get the exact same angle each time). And the fresh flowers in every room? The clients themselves added them later from an image library. \\"It's done all the time,\\" he says. In post-production, Mr. Dubreuil also adjusted the color of the sky on the patio, making it a more saturated blue, as well as the colors in the interior shots. The living room, he says, was lit by warm afternoon sun and appeared \\"creamish pink\\" to him, so he corrected the colors to match that mood. But what color are the living walls actually? Well, not quite peach nor greige. According to Sotheby's broker Anne Corey, they're a complex color with multiple undertones that change with the light. \\"I'd call them cocoa apricot,\\" she says.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person whose music has always sounded like dreamland to Tricky?  Musicians who have cited Bush as an influence include Regina Spektor, Ellie Goulding, Charli XCX, Tegan and Sara, k.d. lang, Paula Cole, Kate Nash, Bat for Lashes, Erasure, Alison Goldfrapp of Goldfrapp, Rosalía, Tim Bowness of No-Man, Chris Braide, Kyros, Aisles, Darren Hayes and Grimes. Nerina Pallot was inspired to become a songwriter after seeing Bush play \\"This Woman's Work\\" on Wogan. Coldplay took inspiration from \\"Running Up That Hill\\" to compose their single \\"Speed of Sound\\".In addition to those artists who state that Bush has been a direct influence on their own careers, other artists have been quoted expressing admiration for her work including Annie Lennox, Björk, Florence Welch of Florence + The Machine, Little Boots, Elizabeth Fraser of Cocteau Twins,  Dido, Sky Ferreira, St. Vincent, Lily Allen, Anohni of Antony and the Johnsons, Big Boi of OutKast, Tupac Shakur, Stevie Nicks, Steven Wilson, Steve Rothery of Marillion, and André Matos. According to an unauthorized biography, Courtney Love of Hole listened to Bush among other artists as a teenager. Tricky wrote an article about The Kick Inside, saying: \\"Her music has always sounded like dreamland to me.... I don't believe in God, but if I did, her music would be my bible\\". Suede front-man Brett Anderson stated about Hounds of Love: \\"I love the way it's a record of two halves, and the second half is a concept record about fear of drowning. It's an amazing record to listen to really late at night, unsettling and really jarring\\". John Lydon, better known as Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols, declared her work to be \\"beauty beyond belief\\".

Simple single-celled eukaryotes have relatively small amounts of such DNA, whereas the genomes of complex multicellular organisms, including humans, contain an absolute majority of DNA without an identified function. This DNA has often been referred to as \\"junk DNA\\". However, more recent analyses suggest that, although protein-coding DNA makes up barely 2% of the human genome, about 80% of the bases in the genome may be expressed, so the term \\"junk DNA\\" may be a misnomer.\\".

The answer to this question is:","output":"The human genome, which belongs to a complex multicellular organism and falls under the category of eukaryotes, contains a significant amount of \\"junk DNA.\\" This term refers to the regions of DNA that do not appear to serve any obvious function. While the term \\"junk DNA\\" may be a misnomer due to the fact that approximately 80% of the bases in the human genome may be expressed, researchers still use it in reference to the large amount of non-protein-coding DNA found in humans and other complex eukaryotic organisms. In contrast, the chromosomes of prokaryotes are gene-dense and have much less \\"junk DNA\\" compared to eukaryotes. Eukaryotic cells are usually more complex and are found in multicellular organisms like plants, animals, and fungi, whereas prokaryotic cells are simple, single-celled organisms such as bacteria.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"less effect. A reduction in pollution is likely to have a positive impact on the butterfly population and their life cycle. Pollution is a significant factor that can negatively influence ecosystems, including the ones that butterflies inhabit. By reducing pollution levels, the life cycle of the butterfly, which is mentioned in the process, can be indirectly improved. Less pollution in the environment could potentially lead to the following benefits, which would result in less negative effect on butterflies: 1. Cleaner air and water sources: Pollution can affect the quality of air, water, and soil. With less pollution, butterflies would have access to cleaner resources that are essential for their survival. 2. Healthier food sources: Less pollution would lead to healthier plants, providing butterflies with better-nourished plant leaves during their larval stage, and more abundant flowers with nectar for adult butterflies. 3. Safer habitats: Reduced pollution levels create safer habitats for butterflies, as hazardous substances such as heavy metals and pesticides can negatively impact the life cycle of butterflies, from their eggs to their adult stage. 4. Decreased effects of climate change: In general, less pollution can contribute to mitigating the consequences of climate change. As climate change can significantly impact the distribution and abundance of butterfly species, reduced pollution would have less effect on the changes in their habitat. On the other hand, if the question specifically refers to the \\"second effect mentioned\\" as the stage where the caterpillar molts (loses its skin) many times as it grows, then there might still be a less effect on this stage of the process. The reduced pollution would foster overall improvement in the caterpillar's health, reducing the potential of harmful disruptions during the molting process. Better conditions place less stress on caterpillars, allowing them to molt and grow normally. In conclusion, less pollution would mean less effect on the butterfly population, with an overall positive influence on their life cycle stages, contributing to healthier, more abundant butterflies in the environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: This movie is Damian Szifrón's second immersion in movies after his excellent character study in \\"El Fondo del Mar\\". With \\"Tiempo De Valientes\\" he creates extremely well done characters, far away from prototypes and with an unprecedented chemistry between them. I've seen Szifron's talent to present every character in a lighthearted way but just enough to involve us emotionally with them. His control over them is magnificent, so he restores on the movie a great direction and an overall brilliantly polished script, the characters laugh and cry with real sentiment and invite the viewer to join them in their emotions and their evolution on screen. The Spanish takes over the English, the Buenos Aires urban landscape at night replaces Hollywood sets and the premise is just as interesting as any other, so we have a film daring to compete over Hollywood's Machinery. But I want you to see the movie mainly because I've never dealt with such endearing characters, all of them. It seems the script suits perfectly to the actors and vice versa. I really believe with a film making like this Argentina is really up to the Competition.","output":"The sentiment of this review is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer praises Damian Szifrón’s work, particularly his ability to create well-developed, unique characters with excellent chemistry between them. They commend Szifrón for his talent in presenting these characters with a perfect balance between lightheartedness and emotional depth. The reviewer also appreciates the excellent direction and script of the movie, which help convey the emotions and character development effectively. Additionally, the reviewer applauds the movie's setting, as it replaces Hollywood with Buenos Aires, providing a fresh and interesting backdrop for the story. One of the main reasons the reviewer encourages others to watch the movie is because of the endearing characters that are perfectly portrayed by the actors. The reviewer believes that filmmaking of this caliber showcases Argentina's competitive edge in the industry. Overall, the sentiment expressed in this review is very positive and appreciative of the director's work, the actors' performances, and the movie's unique aspects."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The title The Swimming Hole dates from 1917 (the year after Eakins died), when the work was so described by the artist's widow, Susan Macdowell Eakins. Four years later, she titled the work The Old Swimming Hole, in reference to the 1882 poem The Old Swimmin'-Hole; by James Whitcomb Riley. The Amon Carter Museum has since returned to Eakins' original title, Swimming.The painting shows Eakins and five friends or students bathing at Dove Lake, an artificial lake in Mill Creek outside Philadelphia. Each of the men is looking at the water, in the words of Martin A. Berger, \\"apparently lost in a contemplative moment\\". Eakins' precise rendering of the figures has enabled scholars to identify all those depicted in the work. They are (from left to right): Talcott Williams (1849–1928), Benjamin Fox (c. 1865 – c. 1900), J. Laurie Wallace (1864–1953), Jesse Godley (1862–1889), Harry the dog (Eakins' Irish Setter, c. 1880–90), George Reynolds (c. 1839–89), and Eakins himself. The rocky promontory on which several of the men rest is the foundation of the Mill Creek mill, which was razed in 1873. It is the only sign of civilization in the work—no shoes, clothes, or bath houses are visible. The foliage in the background provides a dark background against which the swimmers' skin tones contrast. The positioning of the bodies and their musculature refers to classical ideals of physical beauty and masculine camaraderie evocative of Greek art. The reclining figure is a paraphrase of the Dying Gaul, and is juxtaposed with the far less formal self-depiction by the artist. It is possible that Eakins was seeking to reconcile an ancient theme with a modern interpretation; the subject was contemporary, but the poses of some of the figures recall those of classical sculpture. One possible influence by a contemporary source was Scène d'été, painted in 1869 by Frédéric Bazille (1841–70).

Bringing you stories from all over the U.S. today, and we start things off in Colorado. First Up: Colorado Wildfires AZUZ: That's where authorities are trying to put out a wildfire that's been burning for a couple days now. The state's governor has declared a state of emergency. The fire is near the city of Boulder. Around 3,500 people were told to leave their homes, and school was canceled in the area. As of yesterday afternoon, there hadn't been any reports of injuries. Planes, like the one you see here, are dropping fire retardant, chemicals that are used to try to put out the fires. The planes can only fly in certain conditions, though, so if the weather gets bad or the wind picks up, that can be problematic. Officials say that more equipment and more firefighters are heading to the area to help out with the efforts there. AZUZ: Another group that's spoken out against this is the","output":"American Red Cross. They are assisting those affected by the wildfires and providing support to emergency responders. The organization has opened shelters and evacuation centers for those who have been forced to leave their homes, as well as providing supplies and resources for firefighters and first responders. In order for the situation to improve, local officials and firefighters will have to continue working together to contain the blaze. The community will need to be patient and adhere to evacuation orders, as the safety of both residents and emergency personnel relies on their cooperation.

(Associated Press)      The victim was a 65-year-old man who had been treated for lung cancer and was hospitalized in the same facility as another MERS patient, the Health Ministry said.      The outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome has caused panic in South Korea. It has infected more than 120 people since the first case, a 68-year-old man who had traveled to the Middle East, was diagnosed on May 20.      About 3,800 people remained isolated Thursday after possible contact with infected people, according to the ministry, and more than 2,600 schools and kindergartens across South Korea were closed.      On Wednesday, experts from the World Health Organization and South Korea urged the schools' reopening as the outbreak in the country has so far been contained to hospitals and there is no evidence of sustained transmission in the community.      South Korean officials believe the outbreak may have peaked, although they say the next few days will be crucial to determining whether their efforts to isolate patients and control the disease have worked. Three people diagnosed with MERS were released from hospitals Thursday, bringing the total discharged to seven.      President Park Geun-hye postponed her planned U.S. visit scheduled next week to focus on coping with the outbreak.      Most of the deaths so far have been of people who had been suffering from pre-existing medical conditions, such as respiratory problems or cancer.      Experts think MERS can spread in respiratory droplets, such as by coughing. But transmissions have mainly occurred through close contact, such as living with or caring for an infected person.      MERS has mostly been centered in Saudi Arabia and has a death rate of about 40 percent among reported cases. It belongs to the family of coronaviruses that includes the common cold and SARS, and can cause fever, breathing problems, pneumonia and kidney failure. ||||| WHO: To Avoid MERS, Don’t Drink Camel Urine      Six people have died, 87 have been infected, and some 1,800 schools and kindergartens have temporarily shut their doors amid an outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in South Korea. It’s likely the most significant outbreak of the disease outside the Middle East, and over the weekend, the World Health Organization released details on new cases of the disease in South Korea. It also issued a surprising piece of advice for individuals seeking to avoid infection: Drink neither raw camel milk nor camel urine.      That’s perhaps not as strange as it sounds. While the exact transmission mechanisms remain unclear, it is thought that the disease has its origins in bats and that camels may serve as a transmission point to humans. And in parts of the Middle East, drinking camel urine is not as uncommon as one might think. In parts of the Arabian Peninsula, the liquid is consumed for its allegedly palliative properties. The Prophet Mohammed is said to have informed his followers to drink camel urine to cure them of disease.      In 2013, an intrepid reporter for Vice sampled the substance while in Yemen. “The taste of warm piss is, as you would expect, disgusting,” he wrote. “But when it’s mixed with camel milk, as it traditionally is, it’s even worse. Getting rid of the musky aftertaste that takes over your mouth after the first sip is impossible.”      Health researchers have also warned that Saudi camel traders may be another possible point of transmission for MERS. By drinking raw camel milk, they warn, the traders may be unwittingly transferring the disease from their herds to the human population.      Since 2012, the WHO has documented 1,190 cases of MERS with at least 440 deaths.

Close Contacts of an Ill Traveler from the Arabian Peninsula      If you have had close contact*** with someone within 14 days after they traveled from a country in or near the Arabian Peninsula**, and the traveler has/had fever* and symptoms of respiratory illness, such as cough or shortness of breath, you should monitor your health for 14 days, starting from the day you were last exposed to the ill person.      If you develop fever* and symptoms of respiratory illness, such as cough or shortness of breath, you should call ahead to a healthcare provider and mention your recent contact with the traveler.      Close Contacts of a Confirmed Case of MERS      If you have had close contact*** with someone who has a confirmed MERS-CoV infection, you should contact a healthcare provider for an evaluation. Your healthcare provider may request laboratory testing and outline additional recommendations, depending on the findings of your evaluation and whether you have symptoms. You most likely will be asked to monitor your health for 14 days, starting from the day you were last exposed to the ill person. Watch for these symptoms:      Fever*. Take your temperature twice a day.      Coughing      Shortness of breath      Other early symptoms to watch for are chills, body aches, sore throat, headache, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and runny nose.      If you develop symptoms, call ahead to your healthcare provider as soon as possible and tell him or her about your possible exposure to MERS-CoV so the office can take steps to keep other people from getting infected. Ask your healthcare provider to call the local or state health department.      Top of Page      Healthcare Personnel Not Using Recommended Infection-Control Precautions      Healthcare personnel should adhere to recommended infection control measures, including standard, contact, and airborne precautions, while managing symptomatic close contacts, patients under investigation, and patients who have probable or confirmed MERS-CoV infections. They should also use recommended infection control precautions when collecting specimens.      Healthcare personnel who had close contact*** with a confirmed case of MERS while the case was ill, if not using recommended infection control precautions (e.g. appropriate use of personal protective equipment), are at increased risk of developing MERS-CoV infection. These individuals should be evaluated and monitored by a healthcare professional with a higher index of suspicion. For more information, see Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Hospitalized Patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV).      People with Exposure to Camels      MERS-CoV has been found in some camels, and some MERS patients have reported contact with camels. However, we do not know exactly how people become infected with MERS-CoV.      The World Health Organization has posted a general precaution for anyone visiting farms, markets, barns, or other places where animals are present. Travelers should practice general hygiene measures, including regular handwashing before and after touching animals, and avoiding contact with sick animals. Travelers should also avoid consumption of raw or undercooked animal products. For more information, see WHO’s Frequently Asked Questions on MERS-CoV. (Should people avoid contact with camels or camel products? Is it safe to visit farms, markets, or camel fairs?)      The World Health Organization considers certain groups to be at high risk for severe MERS. These groups include people with diabetes, kidney failure, or chronic lung disease, and people who have weakened immune systems. The World Health Organization recommends that these groups take additional precautions:      Avoid contact with camels      Do not drink raw camel milk or raw camel urine      Do not eat undercooked meat, particularly camel meat      *Fever may not be present in some patients, such as those who are very young, elderly, immunosuppressed, or taking certain medications. Clinical judgement should be used to guide testing of patients in such situations.      **Countries considered in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring include: Bahrain; Iraq; Iran; Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza; Jordan; Kuwait; Lebanon; Oman; Qatar; Saudi Arabia; Syria; the United Arab Emirates (UAE); and Yemen.      ***Close contact is defined as a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters), or within the room or care area, of a confirmed MERS case for a prolonged period of time (such as caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a healthcare waiting area or room with, a confirmed MERS case) while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g., gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection); or b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a confirmed MERS case (e.g., being coughed on) while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment. See CDC’s Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Hospitalized Patients with MERS. Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited; considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with MERS (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure risk). Special consideration should be given to those exposed in healthcare settings. For detailed information regarding healthcare personnel (HCP) please review CDC’s Interim U.S. Guidance for Monitoring and Movement of Persons with Potential Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) Exposure. Transient interactions, such as walking by a person with MERS, are not thought to constitute an exposure; however, final determination should be made in consultation with public health authorities.      Top of Page ||||| People have been consuming camel piss on the Arabian Peninsula for a long, long time. It’s been used by the Bedouin people as a shampoo and medicine for centuries, and it’s part of Muslim tradition as well; the Prophet Mohammed is said to have once told some of his sick followers to drink camel milk and pee “till their bodies became healthy.”      Since the seventh century, Yemenis have been following his advice. Statistics about camel urine use are rare, but if you spend any time in Yemen you’ll find some people, mostly in the countryside, who drink urine as a cure for whatever ails them. Some salons use it as a remedy for hair loss, and it’s even occasionally prescribed by some doctors.      Researchers in Muslim countries have lately been trying to lend some scientific basis to the claims that drinking piss will cure diseases. In February, a team from King Abdulaziz University in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, claimed they had extracted a substance called PMF701 from camel urine that could be used to treat cancer. Similar claims were made by the same researchers in 2009, when they said they’d seen evidence that camel milk and pee could fight eczema and psoriasis.      They were never given permission from the Saudi Food and Drug Authority to conduct more studies on patients, however, and there have been plenty of scientists and doctors in the region who have publicly denounced the practice of sipping camel pee. Lecturers from Sana’a University, in Yemen’s capital, have gone out of their way to remind people that quaffing urine is bad for your digestive system, and Dr. Rida Al-Wakil, a professor at a medical school in Egypt, told Alrai, an Arabic-language newspaper in Kuwait, that ads for camel urine treatments for hepatitis were “misleading” and potentially dangerous.      While recently near Ta’izz, Yemen’s third-largest city, I decided to see what all the fuss was about for myself. According to herders I spoke to, pee from virgin female camels is highly prized for its delicate taste and curative powers, and can cost up to the equivalent of 20 for a single liter. I went with nonvirgin urine—for the equivalent of about 4, I got a fresh liter of it from a camel herder named Ahmed and took a long drink.      The taste of warm piss is, as you would expect, disgusting. But when it’s mixed with camel milk, as it traditionally is, it’s even worse. Getting rid of the musky aftertaste that takes over your mouth after the first sip is impossible. It didn’t make me feel any healthier, but it didn’t make me sicker either.

Details of the cases are as follows:      A 49-year-old male developed symptoms on 23 May while admitted to hospital since 14 May. The patient shared the room with a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case that was reported in a previous DON on 4 June (case n. 1). He tested positive for MERS-CoV on 31 May.      A 62-year-old male developed symptoms on 2 June and visited the emergency room of a local health care facility on the same day. The patient was admitted to hospital between 20 and 28 May. During this period, he shared the same floor with four patients that were later confirmed and reported as MERS-CoV cases. On 29 May, the patient visited a local health care facility for unrelated medical conditions. He was isolated in a negative pressure room on 2 June. The patient tested positive for MERS-CoV on 3 June.      A 24-year-old male developed symptoms on 22 May. Between 22 and 28 May, the patient was admitted to the same hospital room as two previously confirmed MERS-CoV cases. He tested positive for MERS-CoV on 4 June.      A 70-year-old female developed symptoms on 31 May. The doctor who was involved in the care of her husband was confirmed positive for MERS-CoV on 3 June. She tested positive for MERS-CoV on 4 June.      A 45-year-old male developed symptoms on 4 June. The patient was admitted to hospital from 14 to 27 May for an unrelated medical condition. Although he did not have symptoms for MERS-CoV, the patient was isolated at home because of close contact at the hospital with MERS-CoV cases. He was transferred to another hospital for isolation on 2 June. The patient tested positive for MERS-CoV on 3 June.      Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for the cases.      The National IHR Focal Point of the Republic of Korea also notified WHO of the death of 1 previously reported MERS-CoV case. The case was reported in a previous DON on 30 May (case n. 3).      So far, a total of 41 MERS-CoV cases, including 4 deaths, have been reported to WHO by the National IHR Focal Point of the Republic of Korea. One of the 41 cases is the case that was confirmed in China and also notified by the National IHR Focal Point of China.      Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1190 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 444 related deaths.      WHO advice      Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.      Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.      Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS‐CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.      Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.      WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"South Korea experienced an outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2015, which resulted in the death of 10 people and infected more than 120 individuals. The virus is believed to have originated from bats and transmitted to humans through camels. The outbreak caused significant panic in the country, leading to the closure of over 2,600 schools and kindergartens. South Korean officials believed that the outbreak had peaked, and many schools were urged to reopen as there was no evidence of sustained community transmission at the time.

I worked for a major commercial airline. A friend of mine and I decided to go to Puerto Rico for a long weekend. It was our first trip to Puerto Rico. The hotel at which we stayed had a lovely (classy/expensive) restaurant serving continental fare. So, we decided to have our first dinner there. We dressed to the nines. Our hair and makeup were perfect. I had fake fingernails (not acrylic - those were fairly new back then. I had the type one glues on). Those fingernails were long, and painted a very bright - and obvious - red. When the waiter came to take our drink order, we both ordered glasses of wine. The waiter brought the wine, set it down on the table, and waited to take our meal orders. I smoked back then, and at the time, smoking was still allowed in restaurants. In a 21-year-old attempt to look classy and sophisticated, at that moment I took out a cigarette, put it between my lips, picked up my lighter, and lit my cigarette - or so I thought. Unfortunately, my long, red, fake thumbnail got in the way of the flame, and it caught on fire. The waiter’s mouth dropped open, his eyes wide. He froze in place. I was horrified. The flame was literally shooting up from my nail! And smoke; the nail was plastic! Quickly scanning the table for the closest thing with which I could extinguish the flame, I spied my glass of wine. As nonchalantly as possible, I stuck my thumb in the glass. There was a sizzle as the flaming nail hit the wine. When I withdrew my thumb from the glass, the nail was melted, black, and curled under. Ever the professional, the waiter regained his composure and proceeded to take our orders without missing a beat - but I’m sure I was the talk of the kitchen for the rest of the evening. So much for my attempt at appearing “classy” and “sophisticated”…. Question: Who was frozen in place? === The answer to the above question is","output":": The waiter was frozen in place.  This makeup disaster story revolves around the narrator's experience during a trip to Puerto Rico with a friend. Both of them were dressed to impress, with perfect hair and makeup, as they dined at an upscale restaurant in their hotel. The disastrous moment occurred when the narrator, who had long, bright red fake fingernails, tried to light a cigarette in an attempt to portray sophistication. When the flame from the lighter caught the plastic nail on fire, the waiter who was attending to them at the table became frozen in place, horrified by the sight of the flaming nail. The narrator had to quickly extinguish the fire by plunging their thumb into a glass of wine. Although the waiter regained his professional composure and continued to take their orders, the narrator's attempt at appearing sophisticated and classy was thwarted by the flaming, melted, and curled fake nail. Undoubtedly, the incident left a memorable impression on the staff at the restaurant and left the narrator questioning their choice of using long, brightly painted fake fingernails as a part of their attempt to exude elegance. Despite the disastrous outcome, the story serves as a humorous reminder of the unpredictable nature of appearances and the situations we often find ourselves in when trying to make a specific impression on others."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: Shiri Movie plot: In October 1992, an elite group of North Korean soldiers are put through a brutal training regime. Under the auspices of their commander, Park Mu-young (Choi Min-sik), they will be sent into South Korea as sleeper agents, to be reactivated at some later date. The most promising of the group is Lee Bang-hee, a female sniper who assassinates several key South Korean figures over the next six years. Over six years later, in September 1998, South Korea is searching for Bang-hee. The agent in charge of her case, Yu Jong-won (Han Suk-kyu) has nightmares about her murdering both him and his partner, Lee Jang-gil (Song Kang-ho). Yu is also engaged to a young woman, Yi Myung-hyun (Yunjin Kim), a former alcoholic and the owner of a fish and aquarium supply store. Hyun symbolically gives Yu a pair of kissing gourami, a species that cannot live without its mate. Yu is worried that he cannot tell Myung-hyun about the real nature of his job due to his security clearance. Yu and Lee are contacted by an arms dealer who claims to have information about their quarry, but he is shot dead by Bang-hee before he can give them any information. After digging a bit deeper, they determine that he had been contacted by the assassin at some point, in the effort to acquire something. That something turns out to be CTX, a binary liquid explosive developed by the South Korean government. In its ground state, CTX is indistinguishable from water, but when placed under the right temperature conditions for long enough, a 200mL worth of CTX has a 1Â km blast radius. The agents begin to suspect its intended use by the assassins, when Kim, a scientist working at a lab connected to CTX, is assassinated by Bang-hee. Park and his agents ambush a military convoy with several liters of CTX, killing all the soldiers and making off with the dangerous liquid before the agents could arrive in time to warn them. Yu and Lee suspect a leak, as they are always one step too slow. Hee is ordered to eliminate the 'kissing gourami' obstacle. Yu meets with Police...

Single/multi-choice problem: Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: To make kitchen chrome appliances shine pick from the following. (I) smear toothpaste on and polish with a soft dry cloth. (II) smear toothpaste on and polish with a soft dry clamp.","output":"Both options involve the use of toothpaste, which is a common household item that contains mild abrasives and gentle cleaning agents. These can be effective in cleaning and polishing chrome appliances. However, the difference lies in the choice of a polishing tool: a soft dry cloth in option (I) and a soft dry clamp in option (II). (I) Smear toothpaste on and polish with a soft dry cloth Using a soft dry cloth as a polishing tool has several advantages. First, it is easily available in most households, making it a convenient choice. Additionally, the soft texture of the cloth prevents scratches on the chrome surface. The flexibility of a soft dry cloth also allows for a better coverage of the appliance's shape and contours during the polishing process. When using a soft dry cloth, you can apply a small amount of toothpaste on the cloth, then gently rub the toothpaste onto the chrome surface in circular motions. Allow the toothpaste to sit for several minutes before polishing the surface with the clean areas of the cloth. The toothpaste residue should be wiped away, leaving the chrome appliance with a shiny and polished appearance. (II) Smear toothpaste on and polish with a soft dry clamp Using a soft dry clamp to polish chrome appliances might prove to be a less effective and convenient choice. A clamp is designed for holding objects tightly or securing them in place, and using it as a polishing tool could lead to unintentional pressure points that may scratch or damage the chrome surface. Additionally, a clamp may not provide the same flexibility and coverage as a soft dry cloth, making it difficult to clean and polish the appliance thoroughly. While it is possible to wrap the soft dry clamp in a soft cloth to protect the chrome surface and use it for polishing, this method is still less convenient and less effective than using a soft dry cloth directly. Conclusion In conclusion, option (I)—smearing toothpaste on and polishing with a soft dry cloth—is the better solution for making kitchen chrome appliances shine. This method offers multiple advantages, including the availability and affordability of the materials, the flexibility and coverage of the soft dry cloth, and the prevention of scratches or damages to the chrome surface. The use of a soft dry clamp, as mentioned in option (II), has limited benefits and might lead to unintentional damage when polishing chrome appliances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Tässä tekstissä mainitaan komissaari, joka pyrkii tasapainoilemaan kahden eri tavoitteen välillä. Ensimmäinen tavoite on uhanalaisten lajien suojelu, joka tarkoittaa toimenpiteitä luonnon monimuotoisuuden säilyttämiseksi ja elinympäristöjen suojeluksi. Tämä on tärkeää, jotta eläin- ja kasvilajien sukupuuttoon kuoleminen saadaan estettyä ja ylläpidettyä maapallon ekologista tasapainoa sekä varmistettua, että tulevat sukupolvet voivat nauttia luonnon tarjoamista palveluista ja hyödyistä. Toinen tavoite on Euroopan köyhimpien alueiden avustaminen, joka kuvaa komissaarin yritystä auttaa näitä alueita taloudellisesti, sosiaalisesti ja kulttuurisesti. Tämä voi sisältää esimerkiksi alueellisten kehitysrahastojen ja investointien käyttöönottoa tai ohjelmia, jotka tukevat paikallista taloutta, koulutusta, terveydenhuoltoa ja sosiaalipalveluja. Euroopan köyhimmät alueet tarvitsevat apua päästäkseen kehittyneempiin alueisiin nähden tasavertaiselle asemalle sekä sisällyttääkseen alueidensa asukkaat täysipainoisesti yhteiskuntaan. Komissaarin tehtävänä on löytää tasapaino näiden kahden eri tavoitteen välillä. Tämä saattaa olla haastavaa, koska molemmat tavoitteet voivat olla joskus keskenään ristiriitaisia. Esimerkiksi luonnon suojeleminen voi vaatia rajoittamaan tiettyjä taloudellisia toimintoja, mikä puolestaan saattaa vaikuttaa negatiivisesti köyhempiin alueisiin. Toisaalta, ekologisen kestävyyden ja uhanalaisten lajien suojelun huomioiminen taloudellisen kehityksen yhteydessä voi auttaa luomaan molempia tavoitteita tukevia ratkaisuja. Ratkaisevaa on siis löytää sellaisia toimintatapoja ja strategioita, joilla voidaan saavuttaa molemmat tavoitteet mahdollisimman tehokkaasti ja kestävästi. Tämä voi esimerkiksi tarkoittaa ympäristöystävällisten teknologioiden ja innovaatioiden edistämistä, luonnonvarojen kestävän hyödyntämisen periaatteiden noudattamista tai sosiaalisten ja kulttuuristen näkökohtien huomioimista kehityspolitiikassa."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

No waitress came by for 10 minutes, so we decided to visit the restroom; there was just one, with one toilet. But a woman rushed in ahead of us, carrying a bundle of clothes. Several minutes later, when she reappeared, we realized this was our waitress—arriving late and pushing us customers out of the way so she could change. OK… We each used the restroom and returned to our table. But it was not our table anymore. Along came the manager to explain she needed to set aside the stage-like area for a very special group. My daughter and I had already been debating whether to stay or leave. We stayed only because we were very hungry and worried that we’d have to start waiting all over again if we tried a different place. We were led to our new table: a lonely little table in the hall leading to the toilet. I was ready to get out of there, pronto, but my daughter spotted her favorite meal on the menu. But after another 15 minutes, with the lone waitress not appearing, we both shook our heads and got up… Oh, here’s the waitress! We ordered. Fifteen minutes later, no food. We got up again and exited past the stage-like area, which was just as empty as it had been when we were ejected.

Please answer the following question: This article: By October 9, Cos had taken over San Antonio de Béxar. Stephen F. Austin sent an advance scout troop of 90 men under James Bowie and James Fannin to observe the Mexican forces. While taking refuge at Mission Concepción on October 28, they repelled an attack by 275 Mexicans under Domingo Ugartechea during the battle. Austin continued to send troops to Béxar. Bowie was ordered on November 26 to attack a Mexican supply train alleged to be carrying a payroll. The resulting skirmish became known as the Grass Fight, after it was discovered that the only cargo was grass to feed the horses. When Austin was selected to join Branch T. Archer and William H. Wharton on a diplomatic mission to seek international recognition and support, Edward Burleson was named as commander. On December 5, James C. Neill began distracting Cos by firing artillery directly at the Alamo, while Benjamin Milam and Frank W. Johnson led several hundred volunteers in a surprise attack.  The fighting at the Siege of Béxar continued until December 9 when Cos sent word he wanted to surrender. Cos and his men were sent back to Mexico, but would later unite with Santa Anna's forces.Approximately 300 of the Texian garrison at Béxar departed on December 30 to join Frank W. Johnson and James Grant on the Matamoros Expedition, in a planned attack to seize the port for its financial resources. Proponents of this campaign were hoping Mexican Federalists would oust Santa Anna and restore the 1824 constitution. When Sesma crossed the Rio Grande, residents of the Gulf Coast began fleeing the area in January 1836. Santa Anna ordered General José de Urrea on February 16 to secure the Gulf Coast.

Plot title: Rails & Ties Movie plot: Laura Danner is a mentally ill, single mother who takes illegal drugs and is unable to care for her 10-year-old son Davey. Driven to despair, she decides to commit suicide by driving a car on to a railway track, taking Davey with her. She offers him some tranquillisers beforehand but, unbeknownst to her, he spits them out. His mother drives on to the tracks. As a train approaches, Davey tries in vain to drag her out of the car, himself jumping clear just in time. Two train crewmen, Tom Stark and Otis Higgs, seeing the car on the tracks ahead, argue about whether an emergency stop will derail the train or not. However, the train hits and kills the boy's mother. Subsequently, the railroad company calls for an internal inquiry and suspends the two drivers. Davey has spent the first night after the incident with an empathetic social worker, Susan Garcia. However, she places the boy with a cold-hearted, disciplinarian foster mother. Later on, after being confined to his room, he escapes by shattering the window. The authorities are alerted and a missing persons search is initiated. The boy obtains train conductor Tom Stark's home address. He turns up at the Starks' home and berates Tom for accidentally killing his mother in the train crash, but eventually he is placated. Tom's wife Megan insists on letting the boy stay although Tom initially disapproves. Caring for Davey gradually helps the couple rebond with each other. Megan is suffering from breast cancer. Having already undergone a mastectomy, she has decided that she will no longer endure chemotherapy and must accept her inevitable death.

(8). transmission Q: Fact 1: Agenerator converts kinetic energy into electrical energy.  Fact 2: Kinetic energy is energy in motion.  Given the two facts above, motion can be converted into electrical energy with a what? A:","output":"Given the two facts above, motion can be converted into electrical energy with a generator. A generator is a device that primarily serves to transform kinetic energy, which is a form of energy associated with the motion or movement of an object, into electrical energy that is utilized to provide power to various devices, appliances, and systems. To understand how this conversion process works, we should delve into the fundamental principle behind generators. The foundation of a generator lies in the phenomenon of electromagnetic induction, which was first discovered by Michael Faraday in 1831. Electromagnetic induction is the process where a changing magnetic field induces an electromotive force (EMF) in a nearby conductor. If the conductor is part of an electric circuit, an electrical current will flow through it as a result of the induced EMF. A generator typically consists of a rotating component called a rotor, which contains magnets that create a magnetic field, and a stationary component called a stator, which consists of coils of wire. As the rotor spins within the magnetic field due to an external force (such as water in a hydroelectric installation, wind in a wind turbine or mechanical energy derived from an internal combustion engine in the case of a gas generator), the magnetic flux through the coils changes. This change in magnetic flux induces an electromotive force in the coils, which in turn generates electrical current. There are different types of generators that are available to serve varying purposes, such as gas generators, diesel generators, wind turbines, and hydroelectric generators, among others. Each of these generators employs the fundamental concept of electromagnetic induction but utilizes a different source of kinetic energy to drive the rotor's motion. In conclusion, motion can be converted into electrical energy using a generator that operates through the principle of electromagnetic induction. By converting kinetic energy into electrical power, generators offer a versatile solution to address a wide array of energy needs, ranging from powering small appliances in off-grid locations to providing large-scale electricity generation for entire nation grids."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It may seem simple, but achieving the perfect consistency and texture of cooked rice can be a tricky endeavor. The secret lies in choosing the appropriate saucepan and accurately measuring your rice. This article will delve into the importance of selecting the right saucepan and measuring your rice to ensure optimal results every time. Step 1: Selecting a Large Saucepan with a Tight-Fitting Lid The first step towards making perfectly cooked rice is picking the right saucepan. Consider the following factors while making your selection: 1. Size - Opt for a large saucepan that can comfortably accommodate the rice and the water it needs to cook. Remember that the rice will expand as it cooks, so the pan should have enough room for the grains to do so without overflowing. 2. Material - Choose a saucepan made from a material that conducts heat efficiently, such as stainless steel, copper, or cast iron. These materials ensure that heat is distributed evenly throughout the pan, helping the rice to cook uniformly. 3. Lid Quality - A tight-fitting lid is essential for keeping the steam trapped inside your saucepan. This allows the rice to cook with the perfect amount of moisture. Make sure the lid seals well around the saucepan's edges to prevent steam from escaping. Step 2: Accurately Measuring the Rice Once you've picked the right saucepan, it's time to measure the rice. Here's how to go about it: 1. Choose Your Measurement Tool - For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your rice rather than relying on volume measurements, like cups. Scales provide a more precise measurement, ensuring consistency every time you cook. 2. Rinse the Rice - Before measuring and cooking, rinse the rice in water to remove any dust or impurities. This also helps to wash away excess starch, which can make the rice stick together once cooked. 3. Measure the Rice - Using your chosen measurement method, weigh out the desired quantity of rice, keeping in mind that uncooked rice typically doubles in size when cooked. For example, 1 cup (200g) of uncooked rice will yield about 4 servings of cooked rice. 4. Determine the Rice-to-Water Ratio - The ratio of rice to water is crucial in achieving the desired texture of your cooked rice. Most types of rice require a 1:2 ratio (1 cup of rice to 2 cups of water). However, some rice varieties (such as basmati or sushi rice) may require different ratios, so consult the package instructions or a trusted recipe for specifics. Conclusion With these essential steps in mind, you'll be well on your way to mastering the art of cooking rice. By selecting a large saucepan with a tight-fitting lid and accurately measuring your rice, you can achieve the perfect texture, consistency, and flavor every time. Give these techniques a try and elevate your culinary skills, impressing family and friends with your perfectly cooked rice dishes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Arthur takes pleasure in asserting his dominance over the inmates and rules the institution with an iron fist. He ensures they live in a state of constant fear, which inevitably leads to high tensions within the prison. Several key inmates, such as Mike \\"The Boss\\" Thompson, a mafia leader; Jamaal \\"The Dealer\\" Harris, a drug kingpin; and Victor \\"The Hitman\\" Martinez, a feared contract killer, among others, form a secret alliance to plot their escape. This diverse group represents each of the major gangs within Demarest and is united by the goal to overthrow Warden Demarest's tyranny. Act 2: As the brewing tension becomes palpable within Demarest, a new and enigmatic inmate named Ethan Walker joins the ranks. With a background in marine intelligence and elite special forces, he was wrongfully convicted of a crime he did not commit. Once inside, he quickly learns how Warden Demarest runs the prison and discreetly begins gathering information to take action against Demarest's oppressive regime. He gains the trust of the key inmates and is introduced to the alliance's master escape plan. The plan involves a complex tunnel system, a diversion, and the use of the upcoming Demarest Prison Festival as a cover to make their escape seem like an accident. They craft blueprints, distribute tasks, and set the plan in motion. However, as the escape day approaches, someone within the alliance betrays them. Their plans are exposed, and Warden Demarest tightens security while trying to identify the mole and the instigators. Act 3: The night of the Demarest Prison Festival arrives, and Ethan Walker discovers the informant's identity: Victor \\"The Hitman\\" Martinez, who was offered early release in exchange for his betrayal. As the festival is in full swing, the prisoners carry out their alternate escape plan. This plan leads to a massive prison riot, and Warden Demarest realizes that he has lost control. In the chaos, Warden Demarest is found dead in his office, causing the entire prison to fall into disarray. Suspicion initially falls on Ethan Walker, who has a military background that would make him a prime suspect in the killing. However, as the truth is unraveled by an internal investigation, it is revealed that it was Victor who killed Demarest to win favor with the alliance again and ensure the success of the escape plan. Epilogue: With Demarest dead and the true identity of the murderer exposed, the prison experiences a change in leadership, and new warden Mary Davies implements reforms for humane treatment within the prison. The members of the secret alliance are apprehended following the failed escape attempt, and each faces additional penalties. Ethan Walker manages to prove his innocence and, with the help of an empathetic prison guard, successfully appeals his wrongful conviction. Upon release, Ethan becomes a highly-sought-after investigator, working to expose corruption within the prison system, ensuring no one suffers as he did."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend blog will know that I suffer from an extremely sensitive scalp which can be really itchy, and I have to be very careful what shampoo I use. I know that I’m sensitive to shampoos containing sodium laureth sulfate (also known as SLS, it’s the ingredient that makes shampoos, shower gels and soaps lather) but I’m also sensitive to some other ingredients in shampoos too – mainly fragrances. I had previously been using Rainforest Balance Shampoo and Conditioner from The Body Shop®, but I found the conditioner a bit too rich and my hair didn’t always feel totally clean after using it. So I started doing a bit of research into recommended natural shampoos – and this Sensitive Shampoo from Lavera kept coming up again and again! Several of the reviews I read said that this was the best shampoo for sensitive scalps and that it left hair feeling really clean and soft, so I decided to try it. The shampoo is a translucent peach-coloured gel that contains organic witch hazel and organic almond milk. It has quite a strong scent, but it’s a nice one so it doesn’t put me off. The shampoo feels creamy when you rub it together in your hands, but I did need quite a lot of it to get a good lather on my first application – the second application lathers a lot more easily. I definitely agree that this makes hair feel a lot cleaner than a lot of the other SLS-free shampoos that I’ve tried, my hair feels clean and full and soft when I’ve used it – the same way it would do if I were using a regular shampoo. I think it also helps my hair to dry more quickly and makes it easier to straighten too. But where this shampoo is outstanding is the way it makes my scalp feel – my scalp feels soothed and calm and there’s no hint of itching. I’ve been using Lavera Sensitive Shampoo for over a year now and I wouldn’t change it for the world, it’s definitely one of the best shampoos for a sensitive itchy scalp.

Prisoners participating in a hunger strike at the Guantanamo Bay detention centre have lodged new complaints about their military jailers to the International Committee of the Red Cross.      Wednesday's charges come as an ICRC team made a fact-finding trip to the US base in Cuba.      In an emergency motion filed with a federal court in Washington, lawyers say guards have refused to provide drinking water to hunger strikers and kept camp temperature \\"extremely frigid'', to thwart the protest.      A spokesman for the detention centre denied the allegations.      \\"The reality is that these men are slowly withering away and we as a country need to take immediate action,'' said Mari Newman, a human rights lawyer based in Denver, who was among those who submitted the motion.      The petition was filed after a Monday phone interview with Musaab al-Madhwani, a Yemeni prisoner.      He told them that guards were refusing to provide bottled water and telling prisoners to drink from tap water that inmates believe is non-potable.      The lawyers say in their motion that the lack of drinkable water has \\"already caused some prisoners kidney, urinary and      stomach problems,'' in addition to the health effects of the hunger strike.      Conflicting accounts      Along with their motion, they submitted an affidavit from Stephen Xenakis, a psychiatrist and retired general, who believes that the hunger strike and lack of adequate drinking water \\"sets them up for gastrointestinal infections and a quick demise''.      The doctor also said the 34-year-old al-Madhwani suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder linked to his torture while in US custody in Afghanistan and could be worsened by harsh conditions at Guantanamo.      Washington has not filed a response to the motion.      Navy Captain Robert Durand, a spokesman for the prison, said prisoners are provided with bottled water and that the tap water is safe to drink.      \\"It's potable water. It's the same water I make my coffee with and that they make lunch with,'' Durand said. He also denied that there had been any change to the air conditioning settings inside the prison camps.      Accounts of the hunger strike have been in sharp conflict for weeks.      Lawyers who have visited or interviewed their clients say a majority of the 166 men held at Guantanamo have joined the protest and some have lost significant weight and are at serious risk.      Obama monitoring      The military said that as of Wednesday, there were 31 men on hunger strike, up from 28 on Monday.      Three men were at the hospital being treated for dehydration and 11 were being force-fed with a liquid nutrient mix to      prevent dangerous weight loss.      A two-person delegation from the International Committee of the Red Cross that includes a doctor is at the base to assess the situation.      They started a week earlier than planned because of the hunger strike, said Simon Schorno, ICRC spokesman.      Their findings will be presented to the camp commander and Miami-based Southern Command, which oversees the prison, but will not be made public.      Lawyers for the prisoners say the hunger strike began on February 6 as a protest of the men's indefinite confinement without charge and because of what they said was a return to harsh treatment from past years, including more intrusive searches and confiscation of personal items such as mail from their families.      The military says no policies or procedures have changed at Guantanamo and the strike is an attempt to draw attention to their cause.      Josh Earnest, White House spokesman, say Obama's team is closely monitoring the hunger strikes, but deferred to the Pentagon for any specifics.      \\"The administration remains committed to closing the detention facility at Guantanamo bay,'' Earnest said, noting that legislation passed by Congress makes it likely that process would not be quick. ||||| Nearly 170 inmates are currently being held at Guantanamo Bay      The International Committee of the Red Cross says it is urgently sending a doctor to Guantanamo Bay because of a growing hunger strike among detainees.      The ICRC says the doctor and another group member are flying to Guantanamo a week earlier than planned \\"because of the current tensions\\" there.      A Pentagon spokesman says 31 of 166 detainees are now on hunger strike.      The inmates - many of whom are being held without charge - are angry at the US failure to resolve their fate.      Last week, more than 21 people at the US detention facility in Cuba were on hunger strike.      'Clear link'      The ICRC said on Wednesday that it had initially planned to send its team to Guantanamo on 1 April.      \\"However, in an effort to better understand current tensions and the ongoing hunger strike, we have decided to start this visit one week earlier,\\" ICRC spokesman Simon Schorno said.      He added that \\"tensions at Guantanamo are certainly related, in our view, to the uncertainty that's prevailing on the future of the detainees\\".      \\"We see a clear link between that and their emotional state.\\"      Pentagon spokesman Maj Jeff Pool told the BBC that 31 detainees were currently on hunger strike.      He said that 11 of them were being fed liquid food through tubes and three were treated at hospital.      Maj Pool provided no comment on the latest visit by the ICRC, saying only that the group's delegations had been visiting Guantanamo about six times a year starting from January 2002.      Hunger strikes have happened frequently at the US military prison, but this is reportedly one of the longest and more widespread protests.      It started several weeks ago and the number of detainees joining the protest was growing steadily.      Human rights groups and lawyers representing the prisoners say it reflects growing frustration at the US military's failure to decide their future.      Nearly 100 of the detainees have been reportedly cleared for release but remain at the facility because of Congressional restrictions and also concerns of possible mistreatment if they are sent back to their home countries.      However, Guantanamo officials deny claims that the strike began after copies of the Koran were mishandled during searches of prisoners' cells.      The military detention centre opened in 2002 to hold suspects captured in counter-terrorism operations after the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Prisoners participating in a hunger strike at the Guantanamo Bay detention centre have lodged new complaints about their military jailers to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).

We had not yet mowed our lawn this spring, and my neighbor said we would never be able to cut the lawn, but, to his surprise, WE DID. It is easy to push, cuts beautifully, and does a great job. It is definitely worth the money, especially with gass over 4.00 a gallon. You get a great workout and a great looking lawn - who could ask for anything more? Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? A:","output":"This review depicts the product in a flattering light. The reviewer highlights a number of positive aspects of the Great Mower, which contribute to a favorable impression of the product.  Firstly, the review praises the ease of assembly, stating that it took less than half an hour to put together with the help of an 8-year-old. This implies that the product is user-friendly and suitable for people of different skill levels. Secondly, the review mentions the effectiveness of the mower, stating that it was able to cut through tall and overgrown grass despite the neighbor's skepticism.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Few athletes would disagree that more muscle is an advantage in their sport. And protein is the perfect source of amino acid building blocks needed for new muscle growth and repair. Taken together, strength training and sufficient protein will stimulate new muscle protein synthesis. Note that the keyword here is sufficient, because this is where protein supplement marketers like to extend to “the more the better”. So how much protein do sportspeople need? Consensus position statements such as those produced by the American College of Sports Medicine give the range of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. But the top end of that range is for elite endurance athletes, power sportspeople and those in the early stages of a strength training phase. The “recreational athlete”, which describes the majority of active sportspeople, should aim for the bottom end of the range. So how do those protein requirement numbers stack up against a regular diet? Protein intake and body weights collected in the 2011-2012 Australian Health Survey, as an example, show the average Australian male already eats 1.2 grams and the average female 1.1 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And this is for mostly sedentary people who are not following any special “high protein” training diet. Sportspeople do have higher energy needs. But by simply eating a greater volume of food with a focus on higher protein content, it’s very feasible for an athlete to get their protein requirements from food alone. This has been backed up by research; numerous dietary surveys show the normal diet of strength-based athletes provides around two grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. And that’s before using any protein powders. But protein supplements can’t be dismissed altogether. There are circumstances where supplementation is an appropriate and convenient option for athletes, such as when travelling, or during an intense training schedule. Question: How many grams of protein per kilo does the author probably eat? Options: - The author doesn't consumer much protein because he doesn't see the point of it - The higher amount recommended - The lower amount recommended - not enough information A:","output":"- Not enough information"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. This film was made and cast from my home town. I remember the fuss about it and the whole hullabaloo about the fact Molly Ringwald was in town... Storyline... Essentially 20 years after a film was \\"laid to rest\\" without being finished, a group of film students set out to complete it - with dire consequences. It would seem someone does not want the film completed. The storyline is flimsy. One has to remember that this is a comedy and therefore has to be taken a little tounge in cheek, but it had no real oomph. The characters are mostly transperant and the little info that you recieve about them you just don't care about, it seems irrelevant. It is weird hearing Kylie's accent as Australian again and nice to see a kid I went to school with in a starring role. But that doesn't redeem the film at all. Goodness knows why the makers thought they would get in Molly Ringwald. Perhaps due to the nature of the film (it sort of pays homage to 80s films / bad horror films)but really an Aussie actor would have done just fine. As far as casting is concerned a lot of the acting seemed constipated. Some of these kids (especially the two main chics - they played \\"director\\" and \\"producer\\") looked like they were trying to act. That is never a good look. Also, the shots had a rough feel about them. Over lit perhaps? Just not as smooth as one is used to. The killer. Lord. Could it be less frightening? There are some shock factors though, and a couple of gross scenes. I did like the film, but it was not great. It went for 90 minutes but could have gone for less. Perhaps if they had tightened the script it would have been better. They had a lot of characters get killed - but no real build up to them getting slayed.

Pay attention if she’s spending more time on her phone.","output":"Title: Recognizing the Warning Signs in Your Marriage: Does Your Wife Need More Attention? Introduction: Marriage requires continuous nurturing of the relationship, understanding each other's feelings, and working together towards the betterment of the bond. At times, one partner may not be content due to several reasons, and it is crucial to identify these signs and address them before it is too late. In this article, we will focus on indicators that suggest your wife may need more attention and how you can tackle these warning signs before they escalate.  1. Your Wife's Complaints: It may be easy to ignore or brush aside your wife's complaints about you or your relationship. However, these criticisms can be a loud and clear cry for attention and understanding. The first step in addressing her concerns is genuinely listening and acknowledging her feelings. Consider these complaints as constructive feedback and identify ways to change your behavior for the betterment of your relationship. Remember, openly discussing the issues at hand will not only help you understand her perspective but can also strengthen your marital bond. 2. Changes in Sexual Desire: Fluctuations in one's desire for sex can be entirely normal. However, if you notice a prolonged or recurring decline in your wife's sexual interest, it may indicate an underlying problem. It is essential to approach this situation delicately, without overt assumptions about the cause. Engage in open communication, express your concerns, and be willing to hear her out. A decrease in sexual desire could stem from internal struggles, unmet emotional needs, or unresolved issues within the relationship. Giving her the attention she needs and working together to address these issues can revitalize your bond and restore intimacy. 3. Lack of Emotional Intimacy: Emotional intimacy is the core foundation of a healthy and long-lasting marriage. If you find yourself sharing less emotional intimacy with your wife – having fewer heartfelt conversations, or not connecting on a deeper level – this can be a red flag that requires immediate attention. Set aside time each day to connect with your wife, practice active listening, and empathize with her feelings. Create a secure environment where she can express her thoughts and emotions without fear of judgment. By rekindling emotional intimacy, you can bring your relationship back on track and ensure both of your emotional needs are met. 4. Increased Need for Privacy: While personal privacy is vital in any relationship, a sudden and significant increase in your wife's desire for privacy could serve as a warning sign. Notice if she becomes more secretive about her phone, computer, or spends more time alone without any reason. Instead of snooping or jumping to conclusions, communicate your concerns and encourage her to share what might be causing her withdrawal. Keeping open lines of communication and ensuring you respect her privacy can help you understand and address any underlying problems. 5. Spending More Time on Her Phone: In today's digital age, it's common for people to spend significant time on their phones. However, if your wife suddenly seems more engaged with her phone rather than you, this could be a sign that she's seeking emotional fulfillment elsewhere. Talk to her about how this behavior affects you and seek ways to reconnect and reestablish the lost connection. Engage in shared activities, find hobbies that interest you both, and prioritize regular date nights to strengthen your bond. Conclusion: Marriage is a complex journey that demands both partners to be attentive to each other's needs and emotions. Recognizing and addressing the warning signs mentioned above is a crucial step towards maintaining a strong, healthy, and loving relationship. Remember that open communication, empathy, and willingness to make positive changes are fundamental factors in building and sustaining a successful life-long partnership with your spouse."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Coming off their last-second home win over the Cardinals, the Ravens flew to Cleveland Browns Stadium for an AFC North duel with the Cleveland Browns.  The match-up would be notable with former Ravens RB Jamal Lewis now playing for Cleveland.  In the first quarter, Baltimore trailed early as the Browns took their opening drive and ended it with QB Derek Anderson (another former Raven) completing a 2-yard TD pass to WR Joe Jurevicius.  Also, immediately after QB Steve McNair got intercepted, Cleveland cashed in with Anderson completing a 78-yard TD pass to WR Braylon Edwards.  In the second quarter, Baltimore managed to get on the board with kicker Matt Stover getting a 21-yard field goal.  However, the Browns continued their offensive surge with kicker Phil Dawson getting a 41-yard field goal, along with Lewis getting a 1-yard TD run.  Even though instant replay showed that the ball was just shy of breaking the plane of the goal line, the Ravens' coaching staff was unable to challenge the play in time.  They would end the half with Stover kicking a 29-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Cleveland continued its surgence with Dawson kicking a 20-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, Baltimore tried to come back, but the only thing from their comeback was McNair's 4-yard TD pass to TE Quinn Sypniewski.  With the surprising loss, the Ravens fell to 2-2, despite outgaining the Browns 418-303 in total offense.  On the positive note, RB Willis McGahee got his first 100-yard game as a Raven, as he ran 14 times for 104 yards.

Multi-select: Knowing that \\"sediment is formed by weathering\\", how would one answer \\"Weathering can\\" Select from the following. (i). release a best selling album. (ii). create a black hole in the desert. (iii). turn a sculpture to dust. (iv). create a time traveling vortex....A:","output":"Weathering is the process by which rocks, minerals, and other materials are broken down into smaller particles by natural forces like wind, water, ice, and temperature changes. It is an essential part of the geological cycle and plays a significant role in the shaping of Earth's landscapes, including the formation of sedimentary rocks. Based on the given choices, the correct answer to the question \\"Weathering can\\" would be: (iii). turn a sculpture to dust. The reasoning for this answer is explained below: (i). Release a best-selling album: This option is not possible because weathering is a natural process that affects Earth's surface and has no connection to music or the entertainment industry. (ii). Create a black hole in the desert: Weathering cannot create a black hole. Black holes are astronomical objects formed through the gravitational collapse of massive stars. They have nothing to do with the weathering processes that occur on Earth's surface. (iii). Turn a sculpture to dust: When a sculpture, typically made of stone or metal, is exposed to the elements over a long period, weathering processes such as physical (mechanical) weathering and chemical weathering can cause the material to break down gradually. Physical weathering includes processes like freeze-thaw cycles, abrasion, and thermal expansion, while chemical weathering involves reactions between the material, water, and atmospheric gases that can degrade the sculpture's structure. As a result, weathering can ultimately turn a sculpture to dust over time. (iv). Create a time traveling vortex: Time travel and time-traveling vortices are constructs found in science fiction literature and movies. There is currently no scientific evidence or known mechanism demonstrating that weathering could create any time-related phenomena. In conclusion, weathering processes can turn a sculpture to dust by causing the material to break down through natural forces over time, but they cannot release a best-selling album, create a black hole in the desert, or create a time-traveling vortex."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

These mutations are considered neutral. Occasionally, a mutation may make a protein even better than it was before. Or the protein might help the organism adapt to a new environment.

Question: What first made the Notre Dame mascot famous around the US? Context: Notre Dame's conference affiliations for all of its sports except football and fencing changed in July 2013 as a result of major conference realignment, and its fencing affiliation will change in July 2014. The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns. The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname. The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by Theodore W. Drake in 1964, the leprechaun was first used on the football pocket schedule and later on the football program covers. The leprechaun was featured on the cover of Time in November 1964 and gained national exposure.

Some of Chopin's well-known pieces have acquired descriptive titles, such as the Revolutionary Étude (Op. 10, No. 12), and the Minute Waltz (Op. 64, No. 1). However, with the exception of his Funeral March, the composer never named an instrumental work beyond genre and number, leaving all potential extramusical associations to the listener; the names by which many of his pieces are known were invented by others. There is no evidence to suggest that the Revolutionary Étude was written with the failed Polish uprising against Russia in mind; it merely appeared at that time. The Funeral March, the third movement of his Sonata No. 2 (Op. 35), the one case where he did give a title, was written before the rest of the sonata, but no specific event or death is known to have inspired it. How many instrumental works did Chopin give a descriptive name to?","output":"Chopin gave a descriptive name to only one instrumental work, which is the Funeral March."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Berge and Brundtland were introduced to each other through a mutual friend in Tromso, Norway. They enjoyed the same films and music, and shared an interest in electronics. Context: Royksopp's third studio album, Junior, was released on 23 March 2009, featuring the single \\"Happy Up Here\\". The song debuted on BBC Radio 1's Pete Tong show on 9 January 2009. It was officially released digitally on 16 March 2009. The music video for \\"Happy Up Here\\", made by Reuben Sutherland, features elements from the arcade game Space Invaders. Both the single and the video were met with positive reactions from the press and fans.  \\"The Girl and the Robot\\", the second single from the album Junior, featuring vocals from Swedish singer Robyn, was released on 15 June 2009. The vinyl and digital versions of the single included remixes of the song by Kris Menace, Chateau Marmont and Spencer & Hill.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The movie opens with shots from the Spanish Civil War, and a line of Spanish refugees crossing the border into France after defeat by the Francoists. Republican guerrilla fighter Manuel Artiguez turns away from the border and back towards Spain. His friends stop him, saying \\"Manuel, the war is over!\\". The story returns twenty years later, to a young boy named Paco, who asks a man named Pedro why Artiguez, who is legendary for his fierce resistance to Franco even after the defeat of the Republicans, has stopped his guerrilla raids against the Francoists in Spain. Pedro sends Paco into France to find his uncle and Artiguez. Paco tells Artiguez that he wants him to kill Viñolas, a Guardia Civil officer, for killing his father. Paco lets Artiguez know that his father was killed because he wouldn't tell the police where to find Artiguez, whom Viñolas must capture if he is to retain his rank in the Guard.  Meanwhile, Viñolas has learned that Artiguez's mother is dying, and sets a trap at the hospital in San Martín to capture Artiguez, presuming that he will come to see his mother. Like all Republican sympathizers, she is contemptuous and deeply suspicious of all Catholic clergy, who collaborated with the fascist Franco regime, both during and after the war.

A brawl ensues and the next morning, when two of the Russians seek revenge on Connor and Murphy, the mobsters are killed in an act of self-defense. FBI Agent Paul Smecker is assigned to the case, and finds that the police and local news reporters see the MacManus brothers as heroes. The duo turn themselves in at a police station, where Smecker interviews them. After they retell their incident to Smecker, he declines to press charges and allows them to spend the night in a holding cell to avoid attention from the media. That night, they receive what appears to be a \\"calling\\" from God telling them to hunt down wicked men so that the innocent will flourish. Connor and Murphy resolve to rid Boston of evil men. Connor learns of a meeting of Russian syndicate bosses at a hotel. Having equipped themselves with weaponry from a local underground gun dealer, the brothers quickly kill all nine Russian mobsters, while Rocco, a friend of the brothers and mob errand boy for local mafia boss Giuseppe \\"Papa Joe\\" Yakavetta, is sent in on an independent hit as an unknowing throwaway. The next day, Rocco learns that he was betrayed by Papa Joe, the hit amounting to an attempt to have Rocco killed by the nine Russian mobsters as he was sent in with only a six-shot revolver. As a result, Rocco commits himself to help Connor and Murphy. That night, the MacManus brothers and Rocco hunt down an underboss of the Yakavetta crime family, Vincenzo Lapazzi, and kill him.

Write some highlights for the following article: Medicare can no longer automatically deny coverage requests for sex reassignment surgeries, a federal board ruled on Friday in a groundbreaking decision that recognizes the procedures are medically necessary for people who don't identify with their biological sex. Ruling in favor of a 74-year-old transgender Army veteran whose request to have Medicare pay for her genital reconstruction was denied two years ago, the agency's Departmental Appeals Board said there was no justification for a three-decade-old HHS rule excluding such surgeries from procedures covered by the national health program for the elderly and disabled. 'Sometimes I am asked aren't I too old to have surgery. My answer is how old is too old?' the veteran, Denee Mallon, of Albuquerque, New Mexico, said in an email interview before the board issued its decision. Medicare's Department of Health and Services review board ruled Friday, May 30, in favor of Mallon, a 74-year-old Army veteran, whose request to have Medicare pay for her genital reconstruction was denied two years ago. Denee Mallon, right, holds a banner before taking part in the Trans March to Morningside Park in Albuquerque. 'When people ask if I am too old, it feels like they are implying that it's a \`waste of money' to operate at my age. But I could have an active life ahead of me for another 20 years. And I want to spend those years in congruence and not distress.' Jennifer Levi, a lawyer who directs the Transgender Rights Project of Gay & Lesbian Advocates and Defenders in Boston, said the ruling does not mean Medicare recipients are necessarily entitled to have sex reassignment surgery paid for by the government. Instead, the lifting of the coverage ban means they now will be able to seek authorization by submitting documentation from a doctor and mental health professionals stating that surgery is recommended in their individual case, Levi said. No statistics exist on how many people might be affected by the decision. Gary Gates, a demographer with The Williams Institute, a think tank on LGBT issues based at the University of California, Los Angeles, has estimated that people who self-identify as transgender make up 0.3 percent of the U.S. adult population. Over 49 million Americans are enrolled in Medicare. The cost of gender reassignment surgery varies, but typically ranges from 7,000 to 50,000, according to the Transgender Law Center in Oakland, California. In Friday's ruling, the appeals board said that HHS lacked sufficient evidence in 1981 when it made a 'national coverage determination' holding that Medicare recipients were ineligible for what it then called 'transsexual surgery' because the procedure was too controversial, experimental, and medically risky. Denee Mallon, second from left, takes part in the Trans March to Morningside Park in Albuquerque on Thursday. The decision recognizes sex reassignment surgeries as a medically necessary and effective treatment for individuals who do not identify with their biological sex such as Mallon. The panel went on to say that regardless of what the record showed then, studies and experts have since shown the efficacy of surgical interventions as a treatment for gender dysphoria, the diagnosis given to people who experience extreme distress due to the disconnect between their birth sex and their gender identity. 'We have no difficulty concluding that the new evidence, which includes medical studies published in the more than 32 years since issuance of the 1981 report underlying the NCD, outweighs the NCD record and demonstrates that transsexual surgery is safe and effective and not experimental. Thus, as we discuss below, the grounds for the ...exclusion of coverage are not reasonable,' the civilian panel said. The appeals board's decisions are binding on HHS unless they are appealed in federal court. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency within HHS that manages Medicare, opted not to defend the transgender surgery exclusion before the five-member board and had initiated the process for lifting it on its own before Mallon filed her complaint. The ruling does not apply to Medicaid, which provides health coverage for individuals and families with low-incomes and is regulated by the states. Some states have exclusions on sex reassignment surgeries and the sex hormones transgender people often take during their transitions, while others evaluate claims on a case-by-case basis. Transgender health advocates said that because private insurance companies and Medicaid programs often take their cues from the federal government on what is considered medically necessary, elective or experimental, the decision could pave the way for sex-reassignment surgeries to be a routinely covered benefit. Mallon was born a man and identifies as a woman. 'When I learned that Medicare denies the essential care I need, I remember saying \`This is not right. They're relying on these archaic reasons to deny me the care my doctor agrees I need? I knew I had to do something to challenge that,' Mallon said. Denee Mallon, center, joins a candlelight vigil organized by Albuquerque Pride in Albuquerque the evening before she won the right for Medicare coverage of her sex change operation. Highlights:","output":"- A federal board ruled that Medicare can no longer automatically deny coverage requests for sex reassignment surgeries, recognizing that these procedures are medically necessary for people who don't identify with their biological sex. - The ruling came in favor of a 74-year-old transgender Army veteran whose request for genital reconstruction coverage was previously denied. - The decision does not mean Medicare recipients are automatically entitled to have sex reassignment surgery paid for; instead, they can now seek authorization with documentation from medical professionals recommending the surgery for their individual case. - The ruling could pave the way for sex reassignment surgeries to become a routinely covered benefit by private insurance companies and Medicaid programs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process:  - Solar radiation reaches Earth's atmosphere - Some is reflected back into space - The rest of the energy is absorbed by land and oceans, heating the Earth - Heat radiates from Earth to space - Some of this heat is trapped by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - Human activities such as burning fuel are increasing the amount of greenhouses gases - This causes more heat radiation to stay trapped in our atmosphere - The Earth's temperature rises -   suppose plants begin to die happens, how will it affect a SMALLER greenhouse effect.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"Indirectly impacting a step of the process. To understand how plants dying could lead to a smaller greenhouse effect, it is important to understand the role plants play in mitigating climate change. One of the ways plants help regulate the Earth's temperature is through a process called photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, plants absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and convert it into glucose and oxygen. Through this process, plants act as natural carbon sinks, helping to reduce the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. If plants begin to die, there would be a disruption in this natural process, leading to potential consequences for the greenhouse effect. There are a few ways in which this might occur: 1. Less CO2 Absorption: When plants die, they are no longer able to take in CO2 through photosynthesis. This would result in an overall decrease in the amount of CO2 being removed from the atmosphere, allowing more CO2 and other greenhouse gas concentrations to build up, which could initially lead to a larger greenhouse effect. However, if plants continue to die off and eventually become scarce, there will be a reduction in the overall biological activity contributing to the release of CO2 and other greenhouse gases (such as methane) into the atmosphere. Fewer plants and less biological activity could lead to a smaller greenhouse effect. 2. Soil Carbon Storage: Plants, particularly trees, help store carbon within the soil. When they die, this carbon storage capability is diminished, potentially releasing stored carbon back into the atmosphere as CO2 or other greenhouse gases. This can initially increase the greenhouse effect. However, over time, as fewer plants are present, the rate of carbon being removed from the atmosphere and stored in the soil will decrease, which could indirectly contribute to a smaller greenhouse effect. 3. Albedo Effect: The presence of plants and trees on Earth's surface impacts the albedo effect—the reflection of sunlight back into space. When plants die, the planet's surface may become less reflective, causing it to absorb more sunlight and potentially increasing the greenhouse effect in the short term. Over time, as fewer plants are present and the reflective capacity of Earth's surface changes, it could indirectly lead to a smaller greenhouse effect as the overall availability of the solar radiation reaching the atmosphere may be affected. 4. Ecosystem Dynamics: The death of plants can also have indirect impacts on the greenhouse effect through changes in ecosystem dynamics. For example, the decline in plant life could disrupt the food chain, affecting populations of herbivores, predators, and insects. These changes could alter the balance of emissions and uptake of greenhouse gases within the ecosystem, potentially leading to a smaller greenhouse effect in the long term. Overall, the death of plants would indirectly impact certain steps of the greenhouse effect process, disrupting the natural carbon cycle, and leading to complex chain reactions in the Earth's ecosystem dynamics. While it may initially seem counterintuitive that the decline of plant life might eventually contribute to a smaller greenhouse effect, it is essential to consider the long-term dynamics of how both direct and indirect impacts of this perturbation may affect the greenhouse effect and overall climate system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Question: \\"Why do people mix kermes lake with chalk or alum?\\"  Context: \\"The painters of the early Renaissance used two traditional lake pigments, made from mixing dye with either chalk or alum, kermes lake, made from kermes insects, and madder lake, made from the rubia tinctorum plant. With the arrival of cochineal, they had a third, carmine, which made a very fine crimson, though it had a tendency to change color if not used carefully. It was used by almost all the great painters of the 15th and 16th centuries, including Rembrandt, Vermeer, Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, Diego Velázquez and Tintoretto. Later it was used by Thomas Gainsborough, Seurat and J.M.W. Turner.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"People mix kermes lake with chalk or alum to create traditional lake pigments, which can be used as paint. The combination of dye from kermes insects with chalk or alum results in a stable and vibrant color, which was highly desirable for painters during the early Renaissance period. Mixing with chalk or alum allows for better adhesion to surfaces, increased color intensity and improved lightfastness, making the colors more resistant to fading over time. This allowed artists such as Rembrandt, Vermeer, Rubens, and others to create visually striking and long-lasting works of art."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The region is also called Sleswick in English.  - Lübeck is a city in Schleswig-Holstein, northern Germany, and one of the major ports of Germany. On the river Trave, it was the leading city of the Hanseatic League, and because of its extensive Brick Gothic architecture is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. In 2015, it had a population of 218,523.  - Funen, with an area of , is the third-largest island of Denmark, after Zealand and Vendsyssel-Thy. It is the 165th-largest island in the world. It is in the central part of the country and has a population of 466,284 (2013). The main city is Odense which is connected to the sea by a seldom-used canal.

This conflict also paralleled the Third Independence War of Italian unification.  - Prussia was a historic state originating out of the Duchy of Prussia and the Margraviate of Brandenburg, and centred on the region of Prussia. For centuries, the House of ruled Prussia, successfully expanding its size by way of an unusually well-organised and effective army. Prussia, with its capital in and from 1701 in Berlin, shaped the history of Germany. In 1871, German states united to create the German Empire under Prussian leadership. In November 1918, the monarchies were abolished and the nobility lost its political power during the German Revolution of 191819. The Kingdom of Prussia was thus abolished in favour of a republicthe Free State of Prussia, a state of Germany from 1918 until 1933. From 1933, Prussia lost its independence as a result of the Prussian coup, when the Nazi regime was successfully establishing its ' laws in pursuit of a unitary state. With the end of the Nazi regime, the division of Germany into allied-occupation zones and the separation of its territories east of the line, which were incorporated into Poland and the Soviet Union, the State of Prussia ceased to exist de facto in 1945. Prussia existed \\"\\" until its formal liquidation by the Allied Control Council Enactment No. 46 of 25 February 1947.  - The Margraviate of Brandenburg was a major principality of the Holy Roman Empire from 1157 to 1806. Also known as the March of Brandenburg (\\"), it played a pivotal role in the history of Germany and Central Europe.  - Germany is a federal republic consisting of sixteen federal states (plural \\"Länder\\"; informally also \\"Bundesland\\", plural \\"Bundesländer\\"). Since today's Germany was formed from an earlier collection of several states, it has a federal constitution, and the constituent states retain a measure of sovereignty. With an emphasis on geographical conditions, Berlin and Hamburg are frequently called ' (city-states), as is the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen, which in fact includes the cities of and . The remaining 13 states are called ' (literally: area states).  - The Austrian Empire (modern spelling \\"\\") was an empire in Central Europe created out of the realms of the Habsburgs by proclamation in 1804. It was a multinational empire and one of Europe's great powers. Geographically it was the second largest country in Europe after the Russian Empire (621,538 square kilometres [239,977 sq mi]). It was also the third most populous after Russia and France, as well as the largest and strongest country in the German Confederation. Proclaimed in response to the First French Empire, it overlapped with the Holy Roman Empire until the latter's dissolution in 1806. The \\"Ausgleich\\" of 1867 elevated Hungary's status. It became a separate entity from the Empire entirely, joining with it in the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary.  - Schleswig-Holstein is the northernmost of the 16 states of Germany, comprising most of the historical duchy of Holstein and the southern part of the former Duchy of Schleswig. Its capital city is Kiel; other notable cities are Lübeck and Flensburg.  - Austria-Hungary, often referred to as the Austro-Hungarian Empire in English-language sources, was a constitutional union of the Austrian Empire (the Kingdoms and lands represented in the Imperial Council, or \\"Cisleithania\\") and the Kingdom of Hungary (Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen or \\"Transleithania\\") that existed from 1867 to 1918, when it collapsed as a result of defeat in World War I. The union was a result of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and came into existence on 30 March 1867. Austria-Hungary consisted of two monarchies (Austria and Hungary), and one autonomous region: the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia under the Hungarian crown, which negotiated the CroatianHungarian Settlement (\\"Nagodba\\") in 1868. It was ruled by the House of Habsburg, and constituted the last phase in the constitutional evolution of the Habsburg Monarchy. Following the 1867 reforms, the Austrian and the Hungarian states were co-equal. Foreign affairs and the military came under joint oversight, but all other governmental faculties were divided between respective states.  - Weimar Republic is an unofficial, historical designation for the German state between 1919 and 1933. The name derives from the city of Weimar, where its constitutional assembly first took place. The official name of the state was still \\"Deutsches Reich\\"; it had remained unchanged since 1871. In English the country was usually known simply as Germany. A national assembly was convened in Weimar, where a new constitution for the \\"Deutsches Reich\\" was written, and adopted on 11 August 1919. In its fourteen years, the Weimar Republic faced numerous problems, including hyperinflation, political extremism (with paramilitaries  both left- and right-wing); and contentious relationships with the victors of the First World War. The people of Germany blamed the Weimar Republic rather than their wartime leaders for the country's defeat and for the humiliating terms of the Treaty of Versailles. However, the Weimar Republic government successfully reformed the currency, unified tax policies, and organized the railway system. Weimar Germany eliminated most of the requirements of the Treaty of Versailles; it never completely met its disarmament requirements, and eventually paid only a small portion of the war reparations (by twice restructuring its debt through the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan). Under the Locarno Treaties, Germany accepted the western borders of the republic, but continued to dispute the Eastern border.  - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard.

Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes.  - Deutsches Reich was the official name for the German nation state from 1871 to 1943 in the German language. It translates literally to \\"German Empire\\", with a context approximating that of \\"German Realm\\".

The province was created in 1868 and also included the Duchy of Lauenburg since 1876 . Following the defeat of Imperial Germany in World War I , the Allied powers organised two plebiscites in Northern and Central Schleswig on 10 February and 14 March 1920 , respectively . In Northern Schleswig 75 % voted for reunification with Denmark and 25 % for staying with Germany . In Central Schleswig the situation was reversed with 80 % voting for Germany and 20 % for Denmark . No vote ever took place in the southern third of Schleswig , as it was considered a foregone conclusion that almost all the inhabitants would vote to remain in Germany . On 15 June 1920 , Northern Schleswig was officially reunited with Denmark ( see : South Jutland County ) . The remainder of Schleswig remained part of Schleswig - Holstein , now a province of the Free State of Prussia . With the Greater Hamburg Act of 1937 , the Hanseatic City of Lübeck and the Oldenburgian exclave Region of Lübeck were incorporated into the Schleswig - Holstein province , while a number of Hamburg 's adjacent municipalities , among them the city districts of Altona and Wandsbek , were incorporated into the Hanseatic City of Hamburg . This again ceded its exclaves of Geesthacht and Großhansdorf to Schleswig - Holstein .

Although it took its name from the region called Prussia, it was based in the Margraviate of Brandenburg, where its capital was Berlin.  - The German Confederation was an association of 39 German states in Central Europe, created by the Congress of Vienna in 1815 to coordinate the economies of separate German-speaking countries and to replace the former Holy Roman Empire. Most historians have judged the Confederation to have been weak and ineffective, as well as an obstacle to the creation of a German nation-state. It collapsed due to the rivalry between Prussia and Austria, warfare, the 1848 revolution, and the inability of the multiple members to compromise.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate.

New York (CNN) -- He didn't compete for the hot dog eating title this year, but he did cause a scene at the contest.  Takeru Kobayashi was arrested at Coney Island after his rival, Joey Chestnut, won the annual Nathan's International Hot Dog Eating Contest.  The six-time champion of the contest was trying to make his way on stage after this year's event, according to a representative for Kobayashi and a New York police officer at the Brooklyn precinct booking desk.  The incident was not a publicity stunt, Maggie James, Kobayashi's spokeswoman, said Sunday night.  \\"He got excited when people chanted his name after the contest .... so he jumped up on the stage because he wanted his fans to see him and (he thought) maybe they would chant, 'Let him eat,'\\" James said, referring to a dispute that kept Kobayashi from the table this year.  Kobayashi -- who took home the title every year from 2001 to 2006 -- did not compete because of a contract dispute with Major League Eating. He watched from the stands.  Chestnut won by consuming 54 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes. The win -- Chestnut's fourth straight -- was short of his 68-hot dog record set last year.  A statement from the New York Police Department's public affairs office following the arrest said Kobayashi was charged with two misdemeanors and one violation, with the violation considered a low-level charge similar to a traffic violation. The two misdemeanors were resisting arrest and obstructing government administration (specifically, interfering with police). The violation was trespassing.

The term \\"marauders\\" often denotes individuals who pillage, loot, or plunder, and the use of the word \\"packs\\" indicates several groups of such individuals. 4. Racing through the ruins: The marauders are described as moving rapidly or hurriedly through the ruins, suggesting that they are either pursuing something, fleeing from something, or actively engaged in destructive acts. 5. The ruins of the village: This final element provides context for the setting, clarifying that the events are unfolding in a village that has been devastated or destroyed. Given these details, let's now assess the hypothesis, \\"The Voth saw people running in the village.\\" In the premise, we know that The Voth is observing packs of marauders who are \\"racing through the ruins of the village.\\" The marauders, being people engaged in hostile activities, are running or moving rapidly. This corresponds with the key elements of the hypothesis, which involves seeing people running in the village. However, the hypothesis slightly differs from the premise in terms of the context of the village. The hypothesis describes a general village, whereas the premise specifically states that it is a ruined village. Despite this variation, the hypothesis still holds true because it covers the primary actions of the people – running in the village. In conclusion, based on the premise, \\"The Voth stared out at the packs of marauders racing through the ruins of the village,\\" the hypothesis \\"The Voth saw people running in the village\\" is true. This is because the elements in the premise, such as The Voth's attentive observation and the packs of marauders racing, support the assertion that The Voth witnessed people (in this case, marauders) running within the village. However, it is worth noting the subtle difference in the context of the village, as the premise specifically mentions the ruins of the village while the hypothesis refers to a general village setting."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve -287*b + 85*b - 14*b + 2592 = 0 for b.","output":"To solve -287*b + 85*b - 14*b + 2592 = 0 for b, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms. We have three terms involving the variable b: -287*b, 85*b, and -14*b. Combine these terms by adding up their coefficients: -287 + 85 - 14 = -216. So the equation becomes: -216*b + 2592 = 0. Step 2: Isolate the variable b. To isolate b, we want to get b alone on one side of the equation. To do this, add 216*b to both sides of the equation: -216*b + 216*b + 2592 = 216*b + 0. This simplifies to: 2592 = 216*b. Step 3: Solve for b. Now that we have isolated b, we can solve for it by dividing both sides of the equation by 216: 2592/216 = 216*b/216.

A: A:","output":"Plants move enormous amounts of water from the soil to the atmosphere through the process of transpiration. Transpiration is the process by which moisture is transported from a plant's roots through its vascular tissues (xylem) to the leaves, where it evaporates into the atmosphere through tiny pores known as stomata. Transpiration serves several vital functions for plants, including: 1. Cooling: As water evaporates from the leaf's surface, it helps to dissipate excess heat and maintain a stable temperature within the plant. This is especially important during hot, sunny days when the risk of overheating is high. 2. Nutrient Transport: As water moves through the plant's vascular system, it carries essential nutrients absorbed from the soil to different parts of the plant. These nutrients are crucial for plant growth, development, and overall health. 3. Maintenance of Turgor Pressure: Turgor pressure is the force exerted by the water inside a plant's cells against the cell walls. This pressure maintains the structural integrity of the plant, keeping it upright and rigid. Transpiration continuously moves water from the roots to the leaves, helping maintain this essential internal pressure. 4. Draw Water from the Roots: Transpiration creates a negative pressure (suction) within the xylem that pulls water upward from the roots to the canopy. This movement is aided by cohesion (the attraction of water molecules to each other) and adhesion (the attraction of water molecules to the walls of the xylem). The rate of transpiration is influenced by several factors, such as: 1. Light: Increased light intensity usually leads to a higher rate of transpiration, as stomata open wider to facilitate photosynthesis in response to bright conditions. 2. Temperature: Warmer temperatures cause water to evaporate more quickly, increasing the rate of transpiration. Cooler temperatures slow down the process. 3. Humidity: High humidity decreases the rate of transpiration, as there is less potential for the surrounding air to absorb additional moisture. Low humidity, on the other hand, accelerates the process. 4. Wind: Wind increases transpiration by removing the moisture-laden air near the leaf's surface, allowing for more evaporation. In calm conditions, a layer of saturated air may form around the leaf, slowing down transpiration. 5. Soil Moisture: Adequate soil moisture is essential for optimal transpiration rates. When the soil is too dry, plants may close their stomata to conserve moisture, reducing transpiration. In summary, transpiration is the key mechanism by which plants move vast amounts of water from the soil to the atmosphere. This process enables plants to maintain their internal temperature, transport nutrients, support their structure, and draw water from the roots. Various environmental factors, including light, temperature, humidity, wind, and soil moisture, influence the rate of transpiration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This could mean that your parents either refuse to acknowledge when you accomplish something, or that your parents dismiss your accomplishments. Some parents may even ridicule your accomplishments. For example, if you get a good grade on a test, your parents should congratulate you for this accomplishment. If your parents are toxic, then they might ignore what you said, change the subject, make fun of you for being a nerd, or say something like, “So what? It’s just a test.” It is normal for parents to want to guide you, but parents who try to control your behavior may be toxic. This may range from small decisions like what to wear to school to larger decisions like where to go to college or what to major in. If you think that your parents exert a high amount of control over your decisions, then they may be toxic. For example, a parent who encourages you to make your own decisions might ask you questions about where you want to go to college and why; however, a parent who is exerting control over your decisions might tell you where you are going to attend college. Parents who have healthy relationships with their children show their emotional bond by making eye contact with their children, smiling at them, and offering affection in the form of hugs. If your parents have toxic behaviors, then they might not do any of these things. For example, a parent who shows appropriate emotional connection with his child might comfort her if she is crying; however, a parent who lacks an emotional connection with his child might ignore the child or yell at her to stop crying. Healthy boundaries are important in parent-child relationships. If you have good boundaries with your parent, then you should not feel like your lives are one and the same. For example, a parent who has healthy boundaries with her child might ask how her child's friends are doing, but would not insist on hanging out with her child and his friends. Verbal abuse is another form of toxic parenting. If your mother or father call you names, put you down, or just say things to hurt your feelings, then these are all forms of verbal abuse.  For example, your parents should say things to build you up and make you feel good about yourself; however, you would feel bad if your parent said something like, “You’re worthless!” or, “I can’t stand to be in the same room with you!” Some parents will be kind and reassuring one day and then mean and critical the next day. But keep in mind that this is still verbal abuse, even if your parents are not always cruel to you. Parents who are too focused on themselves to notice their children or to treat them properly can also be toxic. If your parents ignore you completely or only acknowledge you when you are doing something that they can brag about to friends, then this is an example of narcissistic parenting and it is toxic.  For example, your parents should encourage you in your interests. A narcissistic parent, however, might only pay attention to you if your interests give him something to brag about, such as by telling all of his friends that you won a scholarship, even though he never asks about your studies or encourages you. Some narcissistic parents may have a personality disorder (PD). A person with PD displays self-centeredness, refusal to accept personal responsibility, constant self-justification, a strong sense of entitlement, and shallow emotions. A parent with PD might treat children like a burden or roadblock to her own personal goals. She will typically rely on emotional manipulation to control her kids. People with PD are often hypercritical of their children and can be physically abusive or prone to endangering their child’s welfare. Some parents are too immature or have other problems (such as addiction) that make it hard for them to be effective parents, so a child ends up taking on some parenting duties. Consider whether you had to take on any parenting roles because your parent was not able or willing to care for you and/or your siblings. These may include things like cooking, cleaning, and caring for other children. Sometimes parents assign cooking and cleaning chores to teach children responsibility, but toxic parents may heap many responsibilities on one child to avoid having to do these things themselves. For example, a toxic parent who does not want to cook or clean may shirk these responsibilities and force one of his children to do all of the cooking and cleaning instead. Some children feel unloved even though their parents say that they love them regularly, because they don’t see this love reflected in how they are treated.  Make sure you aren’t assuming you know how your parents feel about you without good reason. For example, a parent who regularly says “I love you,” but who often ignores her children is not behaving in a way that shows love. Likewise, a parent who says that she wants her children to be independent, but never allows them to make any decisions is not behaving in a way that demonstrates what she says she wants.","output":"The article discusses various signs of a toxic parent-child relationship and highlights the importance of healthy boundaries, love, and support in fostering positive relationships. Some major indicators of toxic parenting include: 1. Lack of acknowledgement for accomplishments: Toxic parents may refuse to acknowledge, dismiss, or even ridicule their child's achievements. This can undermine the child's self-esteem and sense of self-worth. 2. Control over behavior: Excessive control over a child's decisions, ranging from clothing choices to college and major selection, may indicate toxic parenting. Healthy parenting involves guiding and encouraging children to make their own decisions. 3. Inadequate emotional connection: Toxic parents may not engage in healthy forms of emotional bonding such as making eye contact, smiling, and offering affection through hugs, which are essential for a child's emotional well-being. 4. Poor boundaries: Enmeshed relationships with limited independence or boundaries may be a sign of unhealthy parenting. Clear and healthy boundaries involve respecting a child's personal space, autonomy, and privacy. 5. Verbal abuse: Name-calling, putting down, or saying hurtful things to a child are forms of verbal abuse. Even if such negative behavior is not constant, it is still harmful to the child's emotional health. 6. Narcissistic parenting: Parents who are overly focused on themselves and only acknowledge their child when it benefits them may be considered narcissistic and toxic. Such parents might also display traits of personality disorders, including self-centeredness, refusal to accept personal responsibility, and shallow emotions. 7. Imposing parenting duties on children: Toxic parents may force their children to take on significant household responsibilities or caregiving roles due to their own immaturity, addiction, or other issues. While teaching responsibility is important, overburdening a child with such duties can cause undue stress and negatively impact their development. 8. Misaligned verbal expressions of love: If a parent's words do not align with their actions, it may result in confusion and feelings of being unloved. Properly demonstrating love and care is crucial to fostering a healthy parent-child relationship. In conclusion, recognizing and addressing toxic behaviors in parent-child relationships is crucial for fostering a healthy and supportive environment for children to develop and thrive. By promoting positive communication, establishing healthy boundaries, and offering genuine love and affection, parents can pave the way for their child's emotional well-being and success in life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"In the film Hamburger Hill, Sergeant Adam Frantz, played by Dylan McDermott, is wounded during one of the many combat sequences that take place throughout the movie. The film is set during the Vietnam War, and the 3rd Squad, 1st Platoon from the 101st Airborne Division is portrayed as they experience the various challenges of war, both on a personal and professional level. Although the specific detail of what exactly wounds Sgt. Frantz is not explicitly mentioned in the given movie plot synopsis, it can be inferred that it may have been caused by enemy fire, shrapnel, or an explosive during one of the battles. Considering the 1969 setting, the A Shau Valley, and the combative nature of the movie, there are numerous instances where he and other members of his squad could have faced injury. Hamburger Hill is historically based on the Battle of Hamburger Hill (formally known as Hill 937), which was fought by American and South Vietnamese forces against the North Vietnamese Army in May 1969. This battle was known for its ferocious fighting, high casualty rates, and the controversial decision to repeatedly storm a heavily fortified, strategically insignificant position. Wounds and injuries were a common part of the reality for soldiers during the Vietnam War, and the film aims to capture this reality in its portrayal of intense combat scenarios. The soldiers are shown facing numerous hardships, both physical and emotional, which are meant to give the audience an understanding of the struggles that service members went through during this period.

Summarize: Media playback is not supported on this device Stuart Hogg's long-range penalty put the hosts ahead before Finn Russell finished off heavy pressure to score. Replacement Matt Scott touched down the second for a 15-0 lead, with Italy's Carlo Canna missing three penalties. The Azzurri botched two scoring chances before further tries from Tim Visser and Tommy Seymour sealed a bonus point. Four tries brought Scotland's tally for the championship to 14, surpassing their record, set last year, of 11 for a Six Nations campaign. Despite their three victories, the Scots had to settle for a repeat of last year's fourth-place finish, on points difference, after victories for France against Wales, and Ireland over England. This was a 12th Six Nations defeat in a row for Italy, who finished with the Wooden Spoon for a 12th time in 18 seasons. In the Edinburgh rain, mistakes were inevitable but the opening half was an error and penalty-fest, a grind that Scotland slowly but surely took control of. Italy were a creative desert, a line-out horror-show, a goal-kicking nightmare. They lost four of eight line-outs in the first 40 minutes and missed three out of three kicks at goal. Two of those were straightforward, but Canna made a hash of both. Scotland were ahead with a booming Hogg penalty, but the hosts had serious problems of their own despite having the lead. Referee Pascal Gauzere got on their case early and he kept pinging them all day long. The Scots conceded five penalties in the opening 20 minutes, seven in the first 40 and a stratospheric 12 by the early minutes of the second half. Of course, they also had a healthy lead by then. The first came at the end of mountainous pressure, Ali Price eventually put Russell over in the corner. The downside was that they lost Huw Jones to injury in the creation of the score, Scott replacing him. Unlike poor Canna, Russell's kick was good and Scotland were ahead 10-0. Canna missed a second sitter and, soon after, Scotland had a second try when Price chipped over the top close to the Italian line for Hogg to win the aerial dual against Giovanbattista Venditti and bat the ball back into Scott's path. The centre had the easiest job in dotting it down. Scotland had battled their way into the lead with the knowledge that Italy's second-half performances have been a calamity in this Six Nations. Before this game they conceded 70% of their points in the second half and an average of 20 points in the last 20 minutes of the second half. It was Italy who came back strong, though. They camped themselves in the Scottish 22, forced Hogg into making a try-saver on Angelo Esposito, then went again. They won penalty after penalty. John Barclay disappeared to the bin and they won more penalties after that. When it looked like they were about to break through, Edoardo Padovani knocked on with the line at his mercy. It was painful stuff for the visitors. They were undone by Scotland's defence, yes, but mostly by their own lack of wit. Italy had a chronic lack of imagination and accuracy. Just after the hour, Scotland got their third try when Hogg scampered up the left wing, chipped ahead and Visser got the touchdown. Russell's conversion made it 22-0. For them, it was all about the four-try bonus point now. Media playback is not supported on this device Scotland started to hit their stride and the crucial fourth try came after multiple phases drained the life out of the tiring Italians, Russell's lovely hands finding Hogg who put Seymour over. Once again Russell, kicking beautifully, was successful with the conversion. Job done for Scotland. A third win in a championship that has seen them score more points (122) and more tries than they have ever done in the Six Nations. A decent farewell to Cotter, a man who has done so much to take the Scots from despair to hope.

The reviewer expresses their dissatisfaction with the DVD's quality and warns potential customers against purchasing from this particular seller. Their negative experience with the Mulan DVD highlights several issues related to playback, which they detail as skipping, freezing, and going in and out of focus. These problems significantly undermine the viewer's enjoyment of the movie and bring the product's value into question. The fact that the reviewer explicitly advises others not to buy from this seller reinforces their dissatisfaction with the product and the diminishing reputation of the seller. By sharing their negative experience, the reviewer aims to help other potential buyers avoid making the same mistake and encountering the same issues.

Please answer the following question: Since grade school we have known about the food pyramid, but the food pyramid I want to discuss today is quite different: The Mediterranean Food Pyramid. The pyramid is used by countless health organizations, clinics, doctors and many others to guide people to eat in a healthy manner. It is the standard to live by and health professionals unanimously agree that by following this diet pyramid, your health will benefit tremendously. The pyramid is a wonderful synopsis of what the Mediterranean Diet entails. It shows four different food groups and the optimal number of servings of each group that should be consumed. The pyramid was created based on research of the diet that the people in the Mediterranean countries consume. The area was selected as the model because of the low incidence of heart disease and high life expectancy found in the region. One of the primary reasons for the healthy results of the diet is that the people not only use fresh, unadulterated ingredients, they also cook their meals in very healthy ways. They are among the minority of the world’s population that have not embraced the fast food culture that dominates the US and Australia. It should be noted that both countries are battling an obesity epidemic. There are no processed foods, colas, white flour products, pizzas or any unhealthy food in the food pyramid. There are only categories of fresh, healthy foods: fruits and vegetables, nuts and grains, beans, fish and seafood, and healthy oils (primarily olive oil) – plus a little red wine. Your fat consumption should be moderate along with consumption of dairy products such as yogurt and cheese. Eggs can be consumed daily. Fish (seafood) is preferred over meat and should be consumed twice a week. Poultry is also preferred over red meat and should be consumed once a week. Red meat should only be consumed 3 to 4 times a month. The rest of the time, vegetables, legumes, and/or pasta should be the focal point of your meals. Fruit and vegetables (7 servings) should be consumed daily. Question: What issue is the author trying to address by promoting the Mediterranean diet? Options:  A.

Bye guys. - Canada’s eleventh province: Turks and Caicos? http://t.co/5xZQ3DrhzK via @torontostarAmira de Vera ||||| The head of the Turks and Caicos Islands says the country remains open to the long-simmering notion of joining Canada, which is backed by one Canadian premier but dismissed by the federal government.      Turks and Caicos Premier Rufus Ewing led a delegation to Ottawa on Monday, meeting with Prime Minister Stephen Harper and other officials during a trip aimed at boosting ties between the countries.      However, the Caribbean nation – a collection of 40 mostly uninhabited islands and roughly 35,000 people – has been the subject of annexation talk, a possible 11th province or fourth territory, for nearly a century. The subject came up again on Monday.      Story continues below advertisement      Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall offered to welcome Turks and Caicos to his province. He later said the offer was partially tongue-in-cheek – \\"Saskatchewarm,\\" he coined it.      \\"I think we want to be constructive in Saskatchewan. If the Prime Minister's looking for a way to make this happen and doesn't want to go through the challenge of creating a province or territory, and Turks and Caicos want to make this happen, just, you know, we'd like a tropical island,\\" Mr. Wall said in an interview. Asked how that could legally work, he replied: \\"I don't know, but if there was a hope we'd put a great group on it and find out.\\"      The notion of the island nation somehow joining Canada dates back at least as far as 1917 and has the backing of one Conservative backbencher, Peter Goldring. He bristles at the notion of annexation but favours boosted economic ties and, if both countries' populations agree, a union of some kind.      The island leader's trip was focused on trade, however. While not ruling out a place in Canada, he said it was not imminent.      \\"I'm not closing the door completely. It is not of my mandate to close the door … What I'll say is on the radar is some kind of relationship. I can't say what kind of relationship it will be,\\" Dr. Ewing, a surgeon by trade who now serves as his country's premier and tourism minister, told reporters.      Canadians pining for tropical turf can take some solace, however – his trip was aimed at further greasing the wheels for Canadians to travel to and do business in Turks and Caicos, with Dr. Ewing saying he was seeking \\"relaxation of immigration issues\\" to the point of \\"seamless\\" borders.      The Conservative government, however, was firmly rejecting any suggestion of welcoming Turks and Caicos into the Canadian fold. \\"We're not in the business of annexing islands in the Caribbean to be part of Canada. So that's not something that we're exploring. We're not looking at any sort of formal association with the islands,\\" Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird said.      Story continues below advertisement      Story continues below advertisement      That will come as little surprise to Mr. Wall. He has never been to Turks and Caicos, and Dr. Ewing has never been to Saskatchewan. Mr. Wall said he recalls hearing talk about the Turks and Caicos joining Canada as long as he's been in politics.      \\"I think people smile when they talk about it,\\" he said, \\"and probably think it'll never happen.\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The Premier of Turks and Caicos Islands, Rufus Ewing, met with Canadian Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, in Ottawa to discuss the possibility of exploring a more formal relationship. The idea of Turks and Caicos becoming Canada's 11th province has been debated for almost a century. Many Canadians have expressed support for the idea on Twitter. However, Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird was quick to dismiss the idea, stating that Canada is \\"not in the business of annexing islands.\\" Nonetheless, Premier Rufus Ewing did not completely close the door on the prospect of joining Canada, and mentioned that the meeting revolved around discussing a relationship between the two countries and relaxation of immigration issues for seamless borders."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Consequently, Joseph had a large social circle, which allowed him to form connections with many different people. In contrast, Joel struggled with building friendships, limiting the size of his social circle. It was evident that being a part of a large social circle brought a lot of benefits for Joseph. He was quite adept at meeting new people, engaging in conversations, and creating meaningful bonds. This skill allowed him to have a diverse and supportive network who would often provide various opportunities and resources, bringing substantial positive impact on both his personal and professional life. In addition, Joseph's extensive network enabled him to broaden his perspectives as he became exposed to different viewpoints and experiences from the people he interacted with. On the other hand, Joel's journey with friendship building was not as smooth. He had a hard time initiating conversations, maintaining them, and being at ease in the presence of others, which resulted in his smaller social circle. Although Joel occasionally managed to establish deep connections with those he befriended, he primarily relied on a select few friends who acted as his safety net. This limited his exposure to the different experiences that a more extensive social network would have provided. As time went by, Joel became more aware of his struggles with making friends. This awareness drove him to be more intentional and proactive about improving his social skills. In this journey of self-improvement, he took the time to observe and learn from Joseph's interaction with people. Joel slowly practiced initiating conversations, listening actively, and expressing empathy, which gradually resulted in the expansion of his social circle. While Joseph's large social circle encompassed a variety of people from different walks of life, giving him access to diverse perspectives and opportunities, Joel's limited social circle offered him fewer opportunities for growth and learning. However, as Joel worked on his social skills, he managed to broaden his network and started developing more meaningful connections with others. In the end, both Joseph and Joel realized the importance of nurturing relationships, and they cherished the value of a strong social circle in their lives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: WHITE HOUSE — A day after U.S. President Donald Trump reversed a policy of separating migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border, the House of Representatives is set to vote Thursday on a pair of immigration bills that address the separations as well as other issues that have divided the country’s major political parties. The outcome of the votes is uncertain. One measure is more hard-line, while the other represents a compromise between the Republican Party’s conservative and moderate wings. The compromise bill includes a provision requiring children and their parents to be detained together if they cross the border illegally. It would also provide 25 billion in funding for Trump’s much-promised border wall, change the existing visa lottery into a merit-based system and provide a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. Republicans hold a majority in both houses of Congress. Party leaders, including President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, have lobbied lawmakers this week in hopes of securing their support for the legislation. “We can enforce our immigration laws without breaking families apart,” Ryan said Wednesday before Trump announced he would sign an executive order to end breaking up families. The president’s policy retreat followed a withering attack by Republican and Democratic officials who characterized the family separations as inhumane. The actions left parents with little or no information about where their children were being taken or when or how they would be reunited. “It’s about keeping families together while at the same time making sure that we have a very powerful, very strong border,” Trump said as he signed the document just before departing the White House for a political rally in the state of Minnesota. Later, at the political rally, the president defended his position saying the executive order he signed hours earlier would not weaken his border strategy: “The border is going to be just as tough as it’s been” despite... Question: Gene Hamilton probably believes that Answer: Answer:","output":"Gene Hamilton probably believes that maintaining a strong and secure border is important, while also addressing the issue of family separations in the context of immigration enforcement. This assumption is based on the context provided, which discusses legislation being voted on by the House of Representatives that addresses both family separations and other immigration issues that have divided political parties in the United States. The compromise bill, which has been supported by prominent Republican leaders such as President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, includes provisions that would require children and their parents to be detained together if they cross the border illegally, as well as allocate 25 billion in funding for a border wall. It also aims to change the existing visa lottery system into a merit-based system and provide a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. Given that Gene Hamilton is likely to align with the Republican party's stance on this issue, he would support a strong and secure border coupled with a more humane approach towards families entering the United States illegally. He may also believe that switching to a merit-based immigration system and providing a path to citizenship for young undocumented immigrants are important steps in addressing broader issues within the U.S. immigration system."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He notes that radiation type A has the ability to break away atoms from molecules, while radiation type B simply causes them to vibrate.  and a hint : Gamma rays, X-rays and the higher energy range of ultraviolet light constitute the ionizing part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The word \\"ionize\\" refers to the breaking of one or more electrons away from an atom, an action that requires the relatively high energies that these electromagnetic waves supply. Further down the spectrum, the non-ionizing lower energies of the lower ultraviolet spectrum cannot ionize atoms, but can disrupt the inter-atomic bonds which form molecules, thereby breaking down molecules rather than atoms; a good example of this is sunburn caused by long-wavelength solar ultraviolet. The waves of longer wavelength than UV in visible light, infrared and microwave frequencies cannot break bonds but can cause vibrations in the bonds which are sensed as heat. Radio wavelengths and below generally are not regarded as harmful to biological systems. These are not sharp delineations of the energies; there is some overlap in the effects of specific frequencies.The word radiation arises from the phenomenon of waves radiating (i.e., traveling outward in all directions) from a source. This aspect leads to a system of measurements and physical units that are applicable to all types of radiation. Because such radiation expands as it passes through space, and as its energy is conserved (in vacuum), the intensity of all types of radiation from a point source follows an inverse-square law in relation to the distance from its source. Like any ideal law, the inverse-square law approximates a measured radiation intensity to the extent that the source approximates a geometric point.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Complete the following sentence. Joel asked Robert how long will the flight be before they arrive, because","output":"Joel asked Robert how long will the flight be before they arrive, because he wanted to ensure that he had enough time to engage in various activities and prepare himself both mentally and physically for their upcoming destination. Joel knew that long flights could sometimes be exhausting and disorienting, particularly due to the jet lag that often accompanied journeys across multiple time zones. Therefore, by obtaining an accurate estimate of the flight duration from Robert, who had booked the tickets and was likely familiar with the details, Joel aimed to optimize his in-flight experience as well as enhance his overall travel plans. Firstly, knowing the flight duration would allow Joel to anticipate how much sleep to get beforehand or during the flight to minimize the effects of jet lag. Research has shown that adjusting one's sleep schedule to adapt to the destination's time zone can considerably alleviate jet lag symptoms such as fatigue, insomnia, and irritability. Moreover, having information about the flight duration would enable Joel to plan any in-flight entertainment or productive activities he wanted to pursue. Many travelers use long flights as an opportunity to catch up on books, movies, or personal projects. By understanding how long he would be in the air, Joel could allocate the most suitable activities for the available time, ensuring that he could balance both relaxation and productivity. Additionally, knowing how long the flight would be would allow Joel to plan when to do some light exercise during the journey. It is crucial to maintain proper blood circulation during long flights to prevent the risk of blood clots or deep vein thrombosis (DVT). By being aware of the flight duration, Joel could stretch, walk around the cabin, or perform some seated exercises at suitable intervals to maintain his health and well-being. Furthermore, understanding the flight duration would help Joel prepare mentally for the trip. An accurate expectation of the time spent aboard the aircraft could reduce anxiety or stress that might arise from being in a confined space for an extended period. Proper mental preparation would result in a more enjoyable experience and alleviate any worries about the impending journey. Lastly, this information would assist Joel in making preparations for his arrival, such as arranging transportation or local accommodations at the destination. Knowing the flight duration would give a clearer sense of when he would be landing at their destination, factoring in any layovers or time zone differences. This precise arrival time would help Joel effectively coordinate plans with Robert and any other travel companions. In conclusion, by asking Robert how long the flight would take before they arrive, Joel was not only aiming to enhance his in-flight experience but also to ensure a seamless transition upon arriving at their destination. It would allow him to manage his in-flight time efficiently, prepare for any travel-related challenges, and maintain a healthy state of mind and body throughout the journey."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what are clouds formed from?\\" is \\"oxygen\\", given that  clouds are formed by  water vapor? A:","output":"The right answer to the question \\"what are clouds formed from?\\" is not \\"oxygen.\\" Clouds are primarily formed from water vapor, tiny water droplets, or ice crystals, depending on the temperature and conditions in the atmosphere. Water vapor comes from the Earth's surface through the process of evaporation, where water is converted from liquid to vapor form. As warm, moist air rises, it cools and the water vapor condenses on tiny particles, such as dust or smoke, suspended in the atmosphere. These tiny particles are called cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). If the water droplets or ice crystals grow large enough, they may eventually form visible clouds in the sky. Although oxygen is present in the atmosphere, it does not play a direct role in cloud formation. However, it is a component of water (H2O) - two hydrogen atoms bonded with one oxygen atom. So, while oxygen is not the correct answer to the question, it is still a vital element within the molecular structure of water."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How do you do this: How can I keep fitted sheets from sliding off the mattress?","output":"To keep fitted sheets from sliding off the mattress, you can try these steps: 1. Make sure you've got the right size sheet: Check if the fitted sheet is the correct size for your mattress. If it's too small or too big, it might slide off easily. 2. Properly secure the corners: When putting the sheet on your bed, grab each corner of the sheet, with the elastic part going under the mattress. Start with one corner, then stretch it over the opposite corner, and repeat it with the other two corners. 3. Tuck in the sides: Once the corners are secured, make sure to tuck the sides of the sheet under the mattress. This helps create a tight and smooth surface. 4. Use sheet suspenders: These are like little straps that connect the sheet corners underneath the mattress. You can find them online or in stores. They help keep the sheet in place by pulling it tight. Just attach the clips to the corners of the sheet and adjust the length of the suspenders to create tension. 5. Opt for sheets with extra-deep pockets: Some fitted sheets have deeper pockets, which means they can cover the sides of the mattress better. Look for sheets designed for your mattress' thickness and make sure the elastic is strong enough to hold tight onto the mattress. By following these tips, your fitted sheets should stay on your mattress without sliding off."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer a question about this article: John, the youngest of five sons of King Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine, was at first not expected to inherit significant lands. Following the failed rebellion of his elder brothers between 1173 and 1174, however, John became Henry's favourite child. He was appointed the Lord of Ireland in 1177 and given lands in England and on the continent. John's elder brothers William, Henry and Geoffrey died young; by the time Richard I became king in 1189, John was a potential heir to the throne. John unsuccessfully attempted a rebellion against Richard's royal administrators whilst his brother was participating in the Third Crusade. Despite this, after Richard died in 1199, John was proclaimed King of England, and came to an agreement with Philip II of France to recognise John's possession of the continental Angevin lands at the peace treaty of Le Goulet in 1200.

How are America's CEOs doing right now? Here's a report, based on a clutch of recent studies by research and consulting firms. To start with, CEOs' job security has gotten a little better, even if that of the people under them may not have. According to numbers from Booz & Co., 13.8% of the nation's CEOs were replaced in 2007, and 14.4% in 2008, but so far this year, through May, that figure is on track to decline to 12.1% When they leave their jobs, they're doing so for pretty much the same reasons as before, Booz finds. Roughly half of departures are planned by the CEOs, and about a third are forced. The rest are driven by mergers and acquisitions--though that last fraction was down modestly last year from 2007, and the first two were correspondingly up. When CEOs leave or are kicked out, their companies are looking for replacements with more experience than ever. That means new CEOs are older than they used to be. The average age of new chief executives today is just shy of 53, which is almost two years older than the starting age of the CEOs they're replacing. The average age of departing CEOs is at record highs for this decade. Fewer of those new CEOs are also serving as chairman, though, Booz found. In North America, where combining those titles is most common, only 18% of new CEOs started with both jobs last year. That is down from around 25% the previous two years, and way down from the historical average of just below 40%. On the other hand, the phenomenon known as \\"CEO apprenticing\\" has been on the rise. That's where the old CEO stays on as chairman to help out the new CEO. In North America the rate of apprenticing for new CEOs stands at around 65%, almost double the historical average of 35%. Those numbers also come from Booz. Companies are thinking twice about how they hire their new CEOs too. A recent survey by WorldatWork found that 44% of companies had reviewed their change-in-control policies in the previous 12 months. In 2003, only 27% had. Some 62% of companies had reviewed their severance practices in the previous 12 months, up from 39% in 2007. How are today's bosses doing in terms of compensation? Equilar's CEO Pay Strategies Report for 2009 looked at the CEOs of companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index and found that their total compensation fell 7.5% between 2007 and 2008. That was the first drop since 2002. A very big part of it: Their average bonus shrank from 1.6 million to 1.2 over those six years. The early bird got the worm, Equilar also found. Bonuses for fiscal years that ended in June or August 2008 were actually up from a year before; bonuses awarded in December 2008 and January 2009--once the severity of the economic slump was fully obvious--were down 28.8%. Also, very few CEOs are able to gross up these days, according to WorldatWork. Grossing up is getting your pay increased to make up for rising taxes. WorldatWork's Severance Survey 2009 found that only 6% of companies had grossed up any executives in the previous six months to cover the burden of the new Golden Parachute Excise Tax. Only 15% were even considering it. CEOs did get to keep some perks, though. Equilar found that in 2008, Fortune 100 companies spent an average of 28.9% more on their CEOs' aircraft than in 2007--141,477, the most in five years. And the portion of those companies that let the boss make personal use of the plane increased from 74.7% in 2007 to 79.2% in 2008. Corporate aircraft are clearly far from a dying institution, despite all the bad press they've gotten lately. Not that CEOs aren't being made to earn what they're given. Equilar lined up CEO pay at S&P 500 companies with shareholder return, and found that the CEOs of the top quartile of companies got bonuses 5.2% bigger last year. In the second and third quartiles their bonuses fell, 16.6% and 42.6% respectively. The worst performers--the bottom quartile-- had their bonuses cut by a whopping 76%. Towers Perrin's research indicates that that's how it will be for the foreseeable future: Pay will follow performance. The trick will be to figure out how to properly reward risk-taking. Towers says, unsurprisingly, that pay entirely in commissions encourages recklessness. Pay in salary alone encourages taking no risk at all. Every company faces the challenge of finding the happy medium between those extremes. Every CEO, meanwhile, faces the challenge of being a master stuntman, willing to take risks but only in very controlled and safe ways. Here's hoping as many as possible pull it off.","output":"Title: \\"Navigating the New Normal: A Close Look at the Challenges and Changing Dynamics in America's CEO Landscape\\" In this article, we explore the current status of America's CEOs based on various recent studies by research and consulting firms.

Yes A:","output":"Title: The Crimson Legacy Genre: Historical Drama/Thriller Plot: During World War II, Countess Nina von Stauffenberg (played by Keira Knightley), the wife of the late Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg - the orchestrator of the failed July 20 plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, is living under a constant threat from the Gestapo. After her husband's execution, she goes into hiding, with her five children at her family's ancestral estate in Bavaria. Nina is torn between her loyalty to her husband's legacy and the desire to protect her children from a formidable enemy. As the war intensifies, the Third Reich is desperate to eliminate any remnants of the July 20 plot and bring the conspirators' families to justice. Nina makes a difficult decision to contact MI6, the British Secret Service, to seek help in keeping her and her children hidden from the Gestapo. Frederick Anders (played by Benedict Cumberbatch), a British spy sent to Germany to gain intelligence, is assigned to help the Countess and her children stay undercover. Simultaneously, SS-Officer Markus Herman (played by Michael Fassbender), a man obsessed with capturing the Stauffenberg family, comes closer to discovering their location. The movie unveils a thrilling game of cat and mouse, as Frederick and Nina work together to outmaneuver Herman and the Gestapo. As the plot evolves, Nina is drawn into an unexpected alliance with the German resistance - a group of people secretly working to bring about an end to Hitler's regime. Risking her own life and the lives of her children, she manages to protect her husband's legacy and contributes her efforts to the German resistance movement. Throughout their journey to evade the clutches of the Gestapo, Frederick and Nina develop a deep bond, finding solace in each other's pain and motivations. This connection complicates the mission, making them more vulnerable than ever. In the climax, the Stauffenberg family and Frederick are cornered by Herman and his troops. However, they are saved by an unexpected air raid by the Allies, which ultimately results in Herman's demise and allows the family to escape to the safety of Switzerland. Epilogue: The war finally comes to an end, and in the post-war era, Nina and Frederick use their inherited family estates to open a charity for war survivors, eventually marrying and raising their families. Countess Nina von Stauffenberg becomes known as the embodiment of resilience and love amidst a dark chapter of history. The Crimson Legacy tells the story of a family's hidden pain, sacrifice, and courage to secure freedom while fostering love, hope, and humanity. With an ensemble cast, gripping plot, and breathtaking cinematography, the film is a testament to the willpower to survive in the face of war and the unyielding power of family."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Process: - A stream or river must occur - Through erosion, the stream cuts into the soil and bedrock - Through continuous erosion, a deep gash is cut through - After many years the river may dry up - A dry ravine is left -   Question: suppose Less rain that year happens, how will it affect MORE or LARGER ravines forming.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"Less rainfall in a given year can have a considerable impact on the formation of larger ravines. The process of ravine formation is influenced by the continuous erosion caused by the flow of water in streams or rivers. These water bodies cut through the soil and bedrock over time, gradually deepening and widening until a ravine is formed. The following paragraphs will discuss the effects of reduced rainfall on the formation of larger ravines and the influence of the supposed perturbation on the second effect mentioned, which is erosion. Firstly, less rainfall over the course of a year could lead to a decrease in the flow and volume of water in streams and rivers. The force of flowing water is a key factor in erosion, and when there is less water available to flow through these waterways, the energy required to cut into the soil and bedrock is reduced. As a result of this, there may be less erosion taking place overall, leading to the formation of fewer or smaller ravines. In addition, the type of soil and bedrock in the area can also influence the rate of erosion and ravine formation. If less rainfall occurs in a region with highly erodible soil, there is a possibility that the rate of erosion may be slower, further impeding the formation of new or larger ravines. Moreover, the reduced flow of water could also affect the transportation of sediment, which is essential for the widening and deepening of existing ravines. With less rainfall and water flow, it may take longer for sediments to be transported downstream, limiting the growth of ravines. Furthermore, the decreased rainfall could influence the surrounding vegetation to some extent. Vegetation can impact how quickly erosion occurs, as it plays a role in stabilizing the soil. Depending on the extent of the change in rainfall, the growth of vegetation may be affected, which could influence the overall stability of the soil and rate of erosion and ravine formation. In conclusion, less rainfall in a given year could lead to less erosion, which would have a direct impact on the formation of larger or more ravines. The supposed perturbation of reduced rainfall would likely result in less erosion, slowing down and potentially reducing the deepening, widening, and overall formation of ravines. In summary, less rainfall could have a notable effect on the process of ravine formation by reducing the force of water required for erosion, influencing the transportation of sediment, and possibly affecting the growth of vegetation - all of which contribute to the rate at which ravines develop."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Cincinnati would get off to a fast start in the first quarter as quarterback Carson Palmer hooked up with wide receiver Andre Caldwell on a 6-yard touchdown pass, while running back Cedric Benson got a 1-yard touchdown run.  In the second quarter, the Bengals would add onto their lead as kicker Shayne Graham nailed a 23-yard field goal.  After a scoreless third quarter, the Ravens tried to strike back in the fourth quarter with running back Ray Rice getting a 2-yard touchdown run, yet Cincinnati's defense held on for the victory.

So, in a football game, the Bengals played the Ravens. The Bengals did pretty well! Their quarterback, Carson Palmer, threw the ball to Andre Caldwell, who caught it in the end zone, which is the place where they score touchdowns. That play was worth 6 points because it was a 6-yard pass. Then later, their kicker Shayne Graham kicked a field goal, which is when you kick the ball between two big poles in the air. His field goal was 23 yards long. Now, to find the difference between the 6-yard touchdown and the 23-yard field goal, we just need to subtract the smaller number (6) from the bigger number (23).

His historical romances draw a picture of frontier and American Indian life in the early American days which created a unique form of American literature. He lived most of his life in Cooperstown, New York, which was founded by his father William on property that he owned. Cooper was a lifelong member of the Episcopal Church and contributed generously to it. James Fenimore Cooper was born in Burlington, New Jersey in 1789 to William Cooper and Elizabeth (Fenimore) Cooper, the eleventh of 12 children, most of whom died during infancy or childhood. He was descended from James Cooper of Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, England, who immigrated to the American colonies in 1679.  Shortly after James' first birthday, his family moved to Cooperstown, New York, a community founded by his father on a large piece of land which he had bought for development. Later, his father was elected to the United States Congress as a representative from Otsego County. Their town was in a central area of New York that had previously been occupied by the Iroquois, who had allied themselves with the British during the Revolutionary War and were forced to cede the territory after British defeat. The State of New York opened the land for sale and development after the war, and Cooper's father purchased several thousand acres in upstate along the headwaters of the Susquehanna River. By 1788, William Cooper had selected and surveyed the site where Cooperstown would be established. He erected a home on the shore of Otsego lake and moved his family there in the autumn of 1790. He soon began construction of the mansion that became known as Otsego Hall, completed in 1799 when James was ten.  Cooper was enrolled at Yale University at age 13, but he incited a dangerous prank which involved blowing up another student's door -- after having already locked a donkey in a recitation room. He was expelled in his third year without completing his degree, so he obtained work in 1806 as a sailor and joined the crew of a merchant vessel at age 17. By 1811, he obtained the rank of midshipman in the fledgling United States Navy, conferred upon him on an officer's warrant signed by Thomas Jefferson.  At 20, Cooper inherited a fortune from his father. He married Susan Augusta de Lancey at Mamaroneck, Westchester County, New York on January 1, 1811 at age 21. She was from a wealthy family who remained loyal to Great Britain during the Revolution. The Coopers had seven children, five of whom lived to adulthood. Their daughter Susan Fenimore Cooper was a writer on nature, female suffrage, and other topics. She and her father often edited each other's work. Among his descendants was Paul Fenimore Cooper (1899-1970), who also became a writer.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: A light drizzle was falling as my sister Jill and I ran out of the Methodist Church, eager to get home and play with the presents that Santa had left for us and our baby sister, Sharon. Across the street from the church was a Pan American gas station where the Greyhound bus stopped.It was closed for Christmas, but I noticed a family standing outside the locked door, huddled under the narrow overhang  in an attempt to keep dry. I wondered briefly why they were there but then forgot about them as I raced to keep up with Jill.     Once we got home, there was barely time to enjoy our presents. We had to go off to our grandparents' house for our annual Christmas dinner. As we drove down the highway through town,I noticed that the family were still there, standing outside the closed gas station.       My father was driving very slowly down the highway. The closer we got to the turnoff for my grandparents' house, the slower the car went. Suddenly, my father U-turned in the middle of the road and said, ''I can't stand it!\\" ''What?\\" asked my mother. ''They've got children. It's Christmas. I can't stand _ .\\" When my father pulled into the service station, I saw that there were five of them: the parents and three children--two girls and a small boy. My father rolled down his window. \\"Merry Christmas,\\" he said. \\"Howdy ,''the man replied. ''You are waiting for the bus?'' my father asked. The man said that they were. They were going to Birmingham, where he had a brother and prospects of a job.     \\"Well, that bus isn't going to come along for several hours, and you're getting wet standing here. Winborn is just a couple miles up the road. They've got a shed with a cover there and some benches\\". My father said. ''Why don't you all get in the car and I'll run you up there.\\"     The man thought about it for a moment, and then he beckoned to his family. They climbed into the car. They had no luggage, only the clothes they were wearing.     Once they settled in, my father looked back over his shoulder and asked the children if...

Answer the following question: Question: If you cut when waiting at the ticket office, what should your punishment be?  Choices:  - auditorium - humans - opera house - death - end of line  The rationale to choose \\"end of line\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"The appropriate punishment for cutting the line when waiting at a ticket office should be to send the individual to the \\"end of line.\\" Rationale: Cutting in line, while rude and inconsiderate, is not a severe offense that warrants extreme punishments such as death. Instead, sending the person cutting in line to the back of the queue is a just and fitting consequence because it: 1. Restores order: When someone cuts in line, the orderly flow of people may be disrupted. Sending the rule-breaker to the back of the line restores order and fairness to the waiting process. 2. Serves as a deterrent: By sending an individual found cutting in line to the end of the queue, it discourages others from engaging in the same behavior, as they can also see the consequence of such an action. 3. Ensures fairness and equality: Allowing line-cutters to get ahead in the queue is fundamentally unfair to those waiting patiently and following the rules. Moving line-cutters to the back of the line ensures that everyone has the same opportunity to access the ticket office in a fair and equitable manner. The other options do not fit the context of the question or lack relevance to the issue of cutting in line:  - Auditorium: Refers to a building or hall designed for public gatherings, such as performances or conferences. It has nothing to do with cutting in line at a ticket office. - Humans: Refers to people in general and doesn't relate specifically to the question of proper punishment for line-cutting. - Opera house: A venue primarily meant for showcasing operatic performances. Like the auditorium, it has no relevance to the issue at hand. - Death: This is an extreme and vastly disproportionate punishment for cutting in line at a ticket office, which does not warrant such a severe response."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Whose film score dealt with the loss of youthful exuberance?  Waters' lyrics to Wish You Were Here's \\"Have a Cigar\\" deal with a perceived lack of sincerity on the part of music industry representatives. The song illustrates a dysfunctional dynamic between the band and a record label executive who congratulates the group on their current sales success, implying that they are on the same team while revealing that he erroneously believes \\"Pink\\" is the name of one of the band members. According to author David Detmer, the album's lyrics deal with the \\"dehumanising aspects of the world of commerce\\", a situation the artist must endure to reach their audience.Absence as a lyrical theme is common in the music of Pink Floyd. Examples include the absence of Barrett after 1968, and that of Waters' father, who died during the Second World War. Waters' lyrics also explored unrealised political goals and unsuccessful endeavours. Their film score, Obscured by Clouds, dealt with the loss of youthful exuberance that sometimes comes with ageing. Longtime Pink Floyd album cover designer, Storm Thorgerson, described the lyrics of Wish You Were Here: \\"The idea of presence withheld, of the ways that people pretend to be present while their minds are really elsewhere, and the devices and motivations employed psychologically by people to suppress the full force of their presence, eventually boiled down to a single theme, absence: The absence of a person, the absence of a feeling.\\" Waters commented: \\"it's about none of us really being there ... [it] should have been called Wish We Were Here\\".O'Neill Surber explored the lyrics of Pink Floyd and declared the issue of non-being a common theme in their music. Waters invoked non-being or non-existence in The Wall, with the lyrics to \\"Comfortably Numb\\": \\"I caught a fleeting glimpse, out of the corner of my eye. I turned to look, but it was gone, I cannot put my finger on it now, the child is grown, the dream is gone.\\" Barrett referred to non-being in his final contribution to the band's catalogue, \\"Jugband Blues\\": \\"I'm most obliged to you for making...

The terms used in the tweet might seem negative initially, but when taking into consideration the context and the way they are utilized, we can determine that the tweet likely carries an overall good-natured sentiment. First, it is essential to consider the context in which the tweet is sent. The user is responding to their friend @AGistheWest, who probably contacted them recently. By positioning the tweet as a response or a follow-up, the user is establishing a virtual conversation with a person they appear to know well. The user calls their friend a \\"loserr,\\" which at face value might seem insulting or negative; however, the playful tone of the message and the three 'r's in the word suggest that this is friendly banter. As such, the sentiment should be understood as teasing or playful instead of genuinely hurtful or negative. Furthermore, the user says, \\"thanks for hitting me back,\\" suggesting that they appreciate their friend's effort to reply or reach out. This part of the tweet demonstrates positive sentiment and gratitude for their communication. Lastly, the user mentions \\"have fun with your wonderful mix thoughhh,\\" which conveys a positive sentiment through the adjective \\"wonderful.\\" The extra letters on \\"thoughhh\\" are another sign of a relaxed and informal tone. While it could be argued that the friend is being sarcastic, it is more likely that they are genuinely wishing their friend enjoyment with whatever \\"mix\\" they might be working on. In conclusion, the tweet may initially appear to have a negative sentiment due to the term \\"loserr,\\" yet the overall tone, context, and positive reference to their friend's \\"wonderful mix\\" reveal that it carries a mix of playful teasing and friendly intentions. The sentiment of this tweet leans more towards positivity and good-natured camaraderie between two friends."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Immanuel Kant, in the Critique of Pure Reason, described time as an a priori intuition that allows us (together with the other a priori intuition, space) to comprehend sense experience. With Kant, neither space nor time are conceived as substances, but rather both are elements of a systematic mental framework that necessarily structures the experiences of any rational agent, or observing subject. Kant thought of time as a fundamental part of an abstract conceptual framework, together with space and number, within which we sequence events, quantify their duration, and compare the motions of objects. In this view, time does not refer to any kind of entity that \\"flows,\\" that objects \\"move through,\\" or that is a \\"container\\" for events. Spatial measurements are used to quantify the extent of and distances between objects, and temporal measurements are used to quantify the durations of and between events. Time was designated by Kant as the purest possible schema of a pure concept or category. What type of measurements are used to quantify the duration of events?","output":"To quantify the duration of events, temporal measurements are used. Various units of time measurement have been developed and standardized to systematically record and compare the durations of and intervals between events. Some common units of time include seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years. These units allow us to record, communicate, and analyze the duration of events and the time that elapses between them. In addition to these standard units of time, specific contexts may require more refined or specialized units, such as milliseconds, microseconds, or nanoseconds, which are particularly useful in scientific and technological research where events or processes occur at exceptionally rapid rates. In other contexts, larger units, such as decades, centuries, or millennia, can be used to comprehend extended periods of time, historical processes, or long-term trends. Besides these linear measures of time, methods of measuring cyclical or recurring events have also been developed, such as lunar cycles or solar cycles, which have been of particular importance in the development of calendars and the tracking of seasonal changes. In summary, various types of temporal measurements are employed to quantify the duration of events. These measurements, which range from extremely small intervals to extensive periods, provide a systematic framework for understanding and comparing the chronology and duration of events within the abstract conceptual framework described by Immanuel Kant in the Critique of Pure Reason."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Aeschylus (UK: , US: ; Greek: Aiskhulos Aiskhulos; Ancient Greek: [ais.khy.los]; c. 525/524 - c. 456/455 BC) was an ancient Greek tragedian. He is often described as the father of tragedy. Academics' knowledge of the genre begins with his work, and understanding of earlier tragedies is largely based on inferences from his surviving plays. One hallmark of Aeschylean dramaturgy appears to have been his tendency to write connected trilogies, in which each play serves as a chapter in a continuous dramatic narrative. The Oresteia is the only extant example of this type of connected trilogy, but there is evidence that Aeschylus often wrote such trilogies. The comic satyr plays that follow his trilogies also drew upon stories derived from myths.  For example, the Oresteia's satyr play Proteus treated the story of Menelaus' detour in Egypt on his way home from the Trojan War. Based on the evidence provided by a catalogue of Aeschylean play titles, scholia, and play fragments recorded by later authors, it is assumed that three other of his extant plays were components of connected trilogies: Seven against Thebes being the final play in an Oedipus trilogy, and The Suppliants and Prometheus Bound each being the first play in a Danaid trilogy and Prometheus trilogy, respectively (see below). Scholars have moreover suggested several completely lost trilogies derived from known play titles. A number of these trilogies treated myths surrounding the Trojan War. One, collectively called the Achilleis, comprised the titles Myrmidons, Nereids and Phrygians (alternately, The Ransoming of Hector).  Another trilogy apparently recounts the entry of the Trojan ally Memnon into the war, and his death at the hands of Achilles (Memnon and The Weighing of Souls being two components of the trilogy); The Award of the Arms, The Phrygian Women, and The Salaminian Women suggest a trilogy about the madness and subsequent suicide of the Greek hero Ajax; Aeschylus also seems to have written about Odysseus' return to Ithaca after the war (including his killing of his wife Penelope's suitors and its consequences) in a trilogy consisting of The Soul-raisers, Penelope and The Bone-gatherers. Other suggested trilogies touched on the myth of Jason and the Argonauts (Argo, Lemnian Women, Hypsipyle); the life of Perseus (The Net-draggers, Polydektes, Phorkides); the birth and exploits of Dionysus (Semele, Bacchae, Pentheus); and the aftermath of the war portrayed in Seven against Thebes (Eleusinians, Argives (or Argive Women), Sons of the Seven).

He stays overnight with a beautiful woman Christine (Renee Soutendijk) and has sex with her (by imagining she's a boy). He plans to leave the next day, but gets a look at a picture of Christine's hunky boyfriend Herman (Thom Hoffman) and decides to stay to have a try at him. Then things get strange. A big X-rated art house hit in the US in 1983. Why was it X rated? Let's see...there's strangulation, full frontal male and female nudity, castration, mutilation, simulated sex, a scene in a church with a cross that will shock most people, a gay sex scene in a crypt...and it's all a comedy!!!!! Paul Verhoeven made this after \\"Spetters\\". \\"Spetters\\" was attacked by the critics for it's extreme sexual sequences and denounced as trash. So, Verhoeven filled this film with very obvious symbolism thinking the critics would think it was art and praise it. He was right! Critics loved the film not realizing that Verhoeven was playing a big joke on them. Still, it's a great film.  It's beautifully shot by Jan de Bont (now a director himself) and there's so much symbolism and obvious \\"hidden\\" layers in the dialogue that you're never bored.

The British journalist recently freed in a NATO military operation described his Taliban hostage-takers as \\"hopelessly inept,\\" and praised his Afghan colleague who died in the rescue. Journalists carry flowers to the grave of Afghan journalist Sultan Munadi in Kabul on Thursday. New York Times reporter Stephen Farrell described his four days in captivity in a blog on the newspaper's Web site, posted late Wednesday just hours after he was freed. Taliban militants kidnapped Farrell and Afghan journalist, Sultan Munadi, on Saturday. During a pre-dawn raid Wednesday, NATO's International Security Assistance Force plucked Farrell to safety, but did not retrieve the body of Munadi, who died during a fierce firefight between troops and Taliban militants. A British commando was also killed, as were a woman and child. There has been criticism about the rescue operation as well as the initial decision to go into the region which Farrell points out in his blog, \\"was becoming more troubled by insurgents.\\" International troops, including British forces, have expressed their unhappiness about having to extract a Western journalist from the area, a Western military source in Kabul told CNN. Meanwhile, NATO has come under fire from a coalition of Afghan journalists working for foreign news outlets who called the pre-dawn raid \\"reckless and double-standard behavior.\\" The Media Club of Afghanistan issued a statement Thursday saying it \\"holds the international forces responsible for the death of Mr. Munadi because they resorted in military action before exhausting other nonviolent means.\\" \\"There is no justification for the international forces to rescue their own national, and retrieve the dead body of their own soldier killed in action, but leave behind the dead body of Sultan Munadi in the area. The MCA deems this action as inhumane.\\" British Prime Minister Gordon Brown intends to send a \\"private\\" letter of condolences to Munadi's family, a spokeswoman for his office told CNN. In his first-hand account of the kidnapping, Farrell praised Munadi for \\"trying to protect me up to the last minute.\\" The two had gone from Kabul to the northern Afghan city of Kunduz on Friday to investigate reports of a NATO airstrike in a Taliban-controlled area. Farrell said he and his colleagues believed the attack, which destroyed two tankers, would be \\"a major controversy involving allegations of civilian deaths against NATO claims that the dead were Taliban.\\" He said they took precautions, including waiting until the next day to drive along the main highway in daylight. While they were interviewing locals about what happened along the riverbank, Farrell said \\"a crowd began to gather, time passed, and we grew nervous.\\" \\"I do not know how long we were there, but it was uncomfortably long,\\" he said. \\"I am comfortable with the decision to go to the riverbank, but fear we spent too long there.\\" All of a sudden, some of the villagers shouted, \\"Taliban\\" and their driver fled with the keys, he said. Farrell and Munadi tried to escape too, but they were captured. Munadi was struck with a Kalashnikov rifle, but Farrell said apart from that incident, the two were not \\"subjected to any beatings, torture or ill-treatment over the next four days.\\" Their Taliban captors operated freely in the area southwest of Kunduz, and appeared to be the only armed presence, Farrell wrote. \\"It became a tour of a Taliban-controlled district of Afghanistan, and that control appeared total,\\" he said. \\"At no point did we see a single NATO soldier, Afghan policeman, soldier or any check to the Taliban's ability to move at will.\\" Farrell said he and Munadi were \\"paraded\\" around by their captors. \\"We were paraded to the children in the street: the infidel and his translator, to be laughed at and mocked,\\" he wrote. The captors operated with relative impunity and, at times, \\"their operational security was hopelessly inept\\" -- using Farrell's name over their mobile phones \\"heedless of who was, almost certainly, monitoring the calls.\\" They even played songs on the radio that praised the Taliban, he said. \\"They were not making it hard,\\" Farrell wrote. At one point, he said they drove near what they said were watchtowers, manned by the Afghan government and NATO, \\"gleeful at their daring.\\" \\"They drove with headlights full on at night as they moved us from house to house, at least three different buildings a day,\\" according to Farrell. He said the Taliban captors seemed to be welcomed by some Afghan villagers, while others appeared \\"more wary and formally polite.\\" During their captivity, Farrell said \\"there were good hours, and bad ones,\\" as well as \\"progress and setbacks.\\" It became harder for the captors to find safe houses, he said. On the third night, there was what appeared to be an attempt to free them, but their captors took them to another refuge within minutes. Then, on the next night, the aerial activity increased and their Taliban captors grabbed their weapons and headed outside -- leaving Farrell and Munadi behind. They ran out later, Munadi in front, and then became separated. Then, Munadi appeared again, holding out his hand to steady a faltering Farrell and they ran across a narrow ledge on the outer wall of the compound. \\"I could hear Taliban voices shouting and shooting from trees to our left, I thought,\\" Farrell wrote. \\"I could also hear indistinct voices ahead. We continued 20 yards along the wall until it suddenly reached the corner.\\" Munadi walked beyond that corner, out into the open, raising his hands and shouting, \\"Journalist.\\" \\"There was a burst of gunfire and he went down immediately,\\" Farrell wrote. \\"In the dark, with firing all around, trees everywhere and my view obscured by him and the wall, I did not know whether the bullets came from in front, to his right or to his left.\\" At the sound of gunfire, Farrell reared back and dived into a wet ditch. After a few minutes, he heard British-accented voices and then screamed, \\"British hostage,\\" flashing a camera light from the ditch. He said he told the soldiers that Munadi was lying behind him, and had possibly been shot. \\"The body was lying motionless in the ditch where I had seen him go down,\\" Farrell said. \\"I hoped he had dropped and was lying still. I knew it wasn't the case.\\" The soldiers told him that \\"they had his picture and would look for him, then dragged me away.\\" \\"It was over,\\" he wrote. \\"Sultan was dead. He had died trying to help me, right up to the very last seconds of his life.\\" Farrell said he was then taken onboard the aircraft, as the soldiers, most of them British, carried on some celebrations. But they fell silent after learning one of the rescuers died from the wounds sustained in the raid. \\"His blood-soaked helmet was in front of me throughout the flight,\\" Farrell wrote. \\"I thanked everyone who was still alive to thank. It wasn't, and never will be, enough.\\" CNN's Ingrid Formanek in Kabul, Afghanistan contributed to this report.

Reason I say it was the dumbest is because I still acknowledge that it’s not my kind of dating scene even though I ended up meeting the love of my life through the app. Other than that? Nothing was wrong or dumb. I have done nothing much because the man I am currently dating sent me a superlike after I was on the app for less than 12 hours. I joined, created profile, went through possible matches, and then went to bed. I didn’t have enough time to do something dumb. Now my boyfriend on the other hand was on the app for 4–5 months prior to me joining and him finding me. His story is that he had been in there long enough to end up matching with some bots (robots that somehow end up joining or hacking the app. I have not a clue how) that he would have conversations with to test if they were legitimate people. He would also match with different people who would either immediately block him because he came as weird or he would block them because they came off as weird. When he found me, what he saw in my profile was that I was local, I was a legitimate person because I knew someone that he knew through Facebook, and I had multiple pictures of myself that looked genuine. I also had a description where I stated my intention for using the app which was that I was looking for a serious relationship. What he did after I connected with him was talk to me and then test me as the conversation progressed. How did he test me? He told a corny joke which I laughed to.

Step 2: Identify the claim to be assessed. - The claim is: \\"I've spent more time on taxes this year than the average person.\\" Step 3: Examine the factors that may justify the claim. - As the user mentioned, they have spent a significant amount of time on income tax. - The change from the EZ form to the regular form likely added complexity and time to the tax filing process. Step 4: Compare the user's situation to the average person. - The average person's time spent on taxes will vary depending on factors such as filing status, income, deductions, and more. - Since the user experienced a change in filing status, it is possible that they spent more time on taxes than someone who has the same filing status consistently or someone who uses a simpler tax filing method (e.g., EZ form).

The justification for this interpretation includes several points. Firstly, the critic mentions about \\"quick cutting\\", \\"blurry step-printing\\" and \\"dopey dialogue\\". These are generally not positive features for a movie, indicating that the aesthetic and technical aspects of the film did not impress the critic.  Secondly, the phrase \\"to goose things up\\" implies the director tried to artificially create excitement or interest through these techniques. This highlights that the critic felt the storytelling was not natural or engaging, suggesting criticism of the director's approach. Finally, the critic outright highlights that \\"inadequate performances kill the effect\\". The reviewer uses the word 'kill' which is strong and negative.

The world's largest social network even went so far as to promise beta testers a trip to Facebook's offices to meet with the Q&A team. I had the chance earlier today to discuss the new feature with several Facebook employees. Questions has several defining features:. • Photo questions: For example, if you take a picture of a bird, but don't know what species it is, you can post the picture on Facebook Questions and get your answer. • Polling: If you're simply looking for the answer to \\"Which city is better: Chicago or Dallas?\\", you can get your answer by creating a poll. • Tagging: The company seems to be placing a lot of emphasis on tagging questions based on category or topic. The goal seems to be to make Q&A discovery an easier and faster process by making it simple to look up questions on cooking, photography, San Francisco or a variety of other topics. • Topic exploration: Facebook described this as a roulette-type feature that allows users to browse Facebook's eventual mountain of Q&A. Under the \\"Questions about\\" drop-down menu, there's a feature called \\"Everything\\" that allows users to browse the company's catalog of questions. • Following: You can follow specific questions for updates and new answers. • Updated homepage: Facebook Questions does actually change the homepage, adding a new bar at the top of the page where you can choose to update your status, ask a question, add photos, or post a link. There was one more thing that Facebook made clear to me: Facebook Questions is not an advertising product. While brands with Facebook Pages will eventually be able to answer questions, it's not meant to be a promotional platform; it's meant to be a useful and insightful product for users. Facebook Questions will roll out to a limited group of beta testers today, but the company promises to \\"bring this product to all of you as quickly as we can.\\" The entire feature is public, so we don't suggest posting those awkward bedroom questions on Facebook.

The 45-year-olds, named yesterday as Marc and Eddy Verbessem, had lived together their entire adult lives and could not communicate with the outside world. Their brother, Dirk Verbessem, said they were terrified of never being able to see each other and feared losing their independence in an institution. 'That was for my brothers unbearable,' said Mr Verbessem, 46. 'Did not want to end up in an institution: Deaf Belgian twins Marc and Eddy Verbessem chose to die by euthanasia because they feared losing their independence after learning they would also soon go blind. 'They lived together, did their own cooking and cleaning. You could eat off the floor. Blindness would have made them completely dependent. 'I sometimes think, if they had their wives and children, perhaps they would have had something to live for.' The twins, from the village of Putte, near the city of Mechelen, were told they would go blind from a genetically caused form of glaucoma and had other severe medical problems, their local doctor, David Dufour. The pair, who both worked as cobblers and could communicate with each other using a special sign language understood only by them and their close family, enlisted the support of Mr Dufour to be euthanised. But it took them almost two years to find a medical institution to carry out the procedure after they were turned by their local hospital. Mr Verbessem told the Daily Telegraph that the family had tried to talk them out of it, but were eventually persuaded by their arguments. Relied on each other: The twins, pictured here on Belgian television before they were named, had lived together their entire adult lives and could not communicate with the outside world. They died by lethal injection four. weeks ago, dressed in new shoes and suits, with Mr Verbessem and their. parents, Mary and Remy, by their sides at Brussels University Hospital. in Jette. Mr Verbessem said: 'Marc and Eddy waved again at us. \\"Up in the sky,\\" they said. \\"Up in the sky,\\" we replied. And then it was over.' Euthanasia is legal under Belgian law. if those making the decision can make their wishes clear and are. suffering unbearable pain, according to a doctor's judgement. The Belgian law differs from that of. Switzerland, famous for its Dignitas clinic, where only 'assisted. suicide' is permitted. This means patients must play an active role in. the administration of the drug that ends their lives. Brussels University Hospital: In Belgium, some. 1,133 cases of euthanasia - mostly for terminal cancer - were recorded. in 2011, about one per cent of all deaths in the country, according to. official figures. In Belgium, some 1,133 cases of. euthanasia - mostly for terminal cancer - were recorded in 2011, about. one percent of all deaths in the country, according to official figures. But this case was unusual as neither twin was suffering extreme physical pain or was terminally ill. Mr Dufour, the doctor who presided. over the euthanasia, told RTL television news that the twins had taken the. decision in 'full conscience'. He said they were 'very happy' and it had was a 'relief' to see the end of their suffering. 'They had a cup of coffee in the hall, it went well and a rich conversation,' Mr Dufour said. More to come? Belgium's ruling Socialists tabled a legal. amendment just days after the twins were killed which would allow the. euthanasia of children and Alzheimer's sufferers (picture posed by. models) 'Then the separation from their parents. and brother was very serene and beautiful. At the last there was a. little wave of their hands and then they were gone.' Belgium was the second country in the. world after the Netherlands to legalise euthanasia in 2002, but it. currently applies only to people over the age of 18. Other jurisdictions where it is permitted include Luxembourg and the U.S. state of Oregon. Just days after the twins were killed,. Belgium's ruling Socialists tabled a legal amendment which would allow. the euthanasia of children and Alzheimer's sufferers. The draft legislation calls for 'the. law to be extended to minors if they are capable of discernment or. affected by an incurable illness or suffering that we cannot alleviate.' The Dignitas building in Pfaeffikon near Zurich: Under Swiss law only 'assisted suicide' is permitted - which means that patients must take an active role in administering the drug that ends their lives. The proposed changes are likely to be. approved by other parties, although no date has yet been put forward for. a parliamentary debate. A bid to tighten legal controls on. assisted deaths in Switzerland and ban suicide tourism was recently. rejected by the country's parliament. Experts say the suicide tourism industry's clients come mainly from Britain, Germany, and France, but that numbers have been declining in recent years. Statistics from Dignitas show the. clinic based near Zurich has helped a total of 1,298 people commit. suicide between 1998 and 2011.","output":"Deaf Belgian twins Marc and Eddy Verbessem chose euthanasia after learning they would soon become blind.

After the red mustang is hosed down, a team of workers efficiently and meticulously begin to soap up the car. Armed with soft sponges and high-quality car wash soap, they work together with precision to cover every inch of the mustang's exterior surface. They know the importance of using a gentle touch on this beautiful, classic vehicle and take care not to scratch the paint as they scrub away dirt and grime. In a well-practiced routine, the workers start at the hood, moving in circular motions to ensure they don't miss a single spot. As they move along the sides of the car, they pay special attention to the wheels, detailing each spoke in a thorough manner. They use special brushes to clean the tire grooves and rid the rims of any residual brake dust. Meanwhile, another worker tackles the windshield and windows, using a separate sponge and glass-specific cleaner to avoid streaks and smears on the glass. They take extra care around the windshield wipers, making sure to lift them and clean underneath. Once the entire exterior of the red mustang is covered in soap, the workers step back for a moment to inspect their work. Satisfied with the coverage, they move on to the next step in the car wash process. The workers grab the hose once more and begin rinsing the red mustang, starting from the top and working their way down. This process ensures that the soap runs off the car and spreads evenly, and avoids any dirty water from flowing down onto a freshly cleaned area. The high-pressure water quickly and effectively lifts away the soap, leaving the car's finish sleek and spotless. After the thorough rinse, the workers take their microfiber towels to carefully dry the car. They understand the importance of properly drying the vehicle to avoid mineral deposits and water spots, so they take their time, ensuring every droplet is removed. Once the red mustang is completely dry, the workers apply a coat of wax to give it that extra shine and protect its paint job from fading or damage. They buff the wax into the car's surface, taking care not to leave any residue behind. Finally, the workers step back and admire their handiwork, the red mustang shining brilliantly and looking like new once again. As the car leaves the car wash, the owner is impressed with the outstanding job the workers have done, and their attention to detail ensures the red mustang remains an eye-catching classic on the road."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the premise \\"Squirrels are funny.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Squirrels are the funniest animals.\\" is true?","output":"To determine the validity of the hypothesis \\"Squirrels are the funniest animals\\" based on the premise \\"Squirrels are funny,\\" it is essential to examine the argument's logical structure, evaluate the context of the terms, and consider alternative candidates for the title of \\"funniest animals.\\" First, let's analyze the logical structure of the argument, which consists of a premise and a conclusion. The premise \\"Squirrels are funny\\" proposes that squirrels possess a quality of humor or amusement. However, the conclusion \\"Squirrels are the funniest animals\\" is not directly derived from the initial premise. The conclusion seeks to assert that squirrels are not only funny but also the funniest among all animals. This leap in reasoning constitutes a logical fallacy, as the conclusion is not justified based solely on the given premise. Next, it is essential to consider the context of the terms used in the argument. The concept of funniness is subjective and can vary significantly between different cultures, people, and individual perspectives. What one individual finds amusing in squirrels might not entertain another, and similarly, what one person deems as the funniest animal may not align with another's perception. It is also crucial to define what aspects make an animal funny—behavior, appearance, or both. Given the subjective nature of humor and funniness, it becomes challenging to establish any one species as the funniest without relying on personal biases. Finally, it is important to consider alternative contenders in the animal kingdom who may be deemed funny by various individuals. Numerous animals, such as monkeys, cats, dogs, or parrots, display behaviors that some people might find amusing, making them worthy contenders for the title of the funniest animal. These animals often engage in playful antics, have unique quirks, or exhibit interactions with humans and other species in ways that may be perceived as funny. Without considering these alternative candidates and establishing the reasoning behind squirrels being the funniest animals, the hypothesis remains unsupported based on the original premise. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"Squirrels are the funniest animals\\" cannot be confirmed solely based on the premise \\"Squirrels are funny,\\" as the argument exhibits a logical fallacy, the subjective nature of humor and funniness, and the presence of alternative candidates within the animal kingdom. To validate such a hypothesis, one would need to develop a sound and universally applicable set of criteria for funniness, compare the comedic levels of various animals based on these criteria, and ultimately provide compelling evidence to substantiate squirrels as the funniest of all species."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The paragraph suggests that the US/NATO strategy played a role in the increase of violence in Pakistan. Step 3: Determine if the given sentence can be concluded from the paragraph. The sentence to evaluate is: The violence was all the fault of Pakistan. Step 4: Analyze the information. The paragraph does not specifically state that Pakistan was at fault for the violence; it only discusses the impact of the US/NATO strategy on the situation. The paragraph mainly focuses on the consequences of actions taken by external forces (US/NATO). Step 5: Make a conclusion. Based on the provided paragraph, we cannot conclude that the sentence \\"The violence was all the fault of Pakistan\\" is true, as the paragraph does not establish a direct blame or fault on Pakistan but rather mentions the impact of external forces contributing to the increase in violence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Your brain isn't a muscle, but you can treat it like one Many people focus on physical fitness, but few know that brain fitness is also something you can work on. In fact, you can exercise your brain as often as you do to your arms or legs-and the results can be positive and empowering. To improve your brain, you can't simply repeat the same exercises over and over. Just as lifting a two-pound weight will stop challenging you, so will repetitive exercises such as crosswords or Sudoku. Once you master easy exercises, you must move on to harder ones in order to push your brain-like your muscles-to a new level. The science behind brain training Scientists once believed that your mental abilities were fixed in adulthood. Since studies have shown just the opposite, millions of people around the world have adopted the new practice of brain training. The most popular of these brain training products is made by the San Francisco-based Lumosity. Lumosity's scientists with an experienced team of game designers have developed a fun,effective online brain training program that measures, tracks, and adapts to your progress, so you'll always be challenged. Promising studies on the effects of brain training In a 2013 Stanford study, a treatment group of 21 breast cancer survivors used 12 weeks of Lumosity training to work on processing speed, mental flexibility, and working memory tasks. On average, those who trained improved on tests of these abilities, compared to a group that did not train with Lumosity. There is even some evidence suggesting that Lumosity may be beneficial to normal, healthy adults. In a 2011 study by Lumosity and San Francisco State University researchers. 13 people who trained over 5 weeks improved working memory scores by 10%and attention scores by 20%. Brain training is designed to meet real-life needs The design of brain train ing is targeted at real-life benefits instead of improving game scores.

Summarize: Media playback is not supported on this device The home side took the lead when Roarie Deacon went down easily under a Steven Whittaker challenge and Kevin Holt dispatched the resulting penalty kick. Whittaker made up for that with a fine low cross that was turned in by Anthony Stokes via defender Kerr Waddell's toe. Hibs came closest to a winner, but goalkeeper Scott Bain was in fine form. Dundee, who had lost their first three Premiership games of the season, move off the bottom of the table, one point ahead of Partick Thistle. Hibs stay in fifth place, now equal on points with Hamilton Academical, who had ended the Edinburgh side's 12-game unbeaten run last weekend. After that home defeat, head coach Neil Lennon was looking for a vastly improved performance against a side yet to get off the mark. But slack play by the Hibees defence has been their Achilles heel so often and it once again proved the case. As Deacon teased Whittaker, the former Rangers and Norwich City full-back stuck out his left leg and, with the Dundee midfielder going to ground, it left referee Don Robertson with a simple decision. Holt slammed the ball home from the spot to give the hosts the lead. Bain in the home goal was showing the type of form that led to his inclusion in Gordon Strachan's Scotland squad last year. The 25-year-old pulled off a string of stunning saves that kept the Dundee goal intact. However, when the Edinburgh side made the breakthrough, they had a fair slice of fortune going their way. Whittaker floated a cross into the box and Stokes diverted the ball goalwards and the final touch came off the leg of Waddell with Bain left stranded on his line. Hibs felt they had fair claims for a penalty when Scott Allan handled the ball as Stokes strode forward, but the referee again waved play on despite the protests from the visiting players. The second half continued on a similar vein, with Bain denying Marvin Bartley and Brandon Barker. Chances at the other end were few and far between, but Faissal El-Bakhtoui did go close to a winner. The Dundee striker's effort from 18 yards drifted inches the wrong side of the post to leave both teams with a point at the end of a pulsating 90 minutes. Dundee manager Neil McCann: \\"I am happy with a point. I'm not going to say we weren't up against it. Hibs are a good side. \\"What Hibs were doing, they were coming in narrow and trying to strangle the game. \\"Today, Neil Lennon will maybe think he deserved three points, but I'm delighted that we got one. \\"Scott Bain was terrific. I have been so impressed with him since I came in.\\" Hibernian head coach Neil Lennon: \\"There was only one team in it. \\"Once we gave our weekly goal away, we played great. \\"We dominated the game and I'm disappointed not to win it. The level of performance was superb. \\"Their keeper was man of the match and we were a little wasteful in front of goal. \\"We're new to the league and it says a lot that we're disappointed not to win this one.

Answer:","output":"Answer: Absorbing sunlight, kinetic energy, and electromagnetic energy. These are the three best answer choices because they all cause cool objects to warm up through different mechanisms: 1. Absorbing sunlight: When an object absorbs sunlight, it converts the solar energy absorbed into heat energy, causing the object to warm up. This is a common way in which objects on Earth, like rocks or the ground, get heated during the daytime. 2. Kinetic energy: When a cool object comes into contact with a warmer object or substance, the faster-moving particles of the warmer object transfer their kinetic energy to the slower-moving particles of the cooler object. This causes an increase in the temperature of the cooler object. This process is called heat conduction. 3. Electromagnetic energy: Electromagnetic radiation, such as microwaves, infrared radiation, and radio waves, can also heat objects. When electromagnetic waves interact with an object, the object's particles absorb the energy and vibrate at a faster rate, causing the object to heat up.

Don't leave notes on the door.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Safeguarding Your Home: Top Techniques to Thwart Potential Intruders Introduction Home security is a significant concern for many homeowners, especially with the ever-evolving threats that technology brings. With innovation in techniques employed by criminals, it is crucial to adopt a proactive and multifaceted approach to ensure your home's safety. In this article, we will highlight some key steps you can take to best protect your home from potential burglary attempts. From simple practices of locking doors and windows to the installation of exterior lighting, these actions will not only deter burglars but also add a layer of protection to your personal sanctuary. 1. Lock external doors at all times One of the most basic yet crucial home security steps is always locking your external doors. It may seem obvious, but many burglaries occur due to unlocked doors that provide criminals easy access to your home. Invest in high-quality deadbolt locks and ensure all family members develop the habit of locking doors whenever they leave the premises, even if it's just for a short period. In addition, the use of a security chain or a secondary lock can further strengthen the security of your doors. 2. Lock your external windows and sliding glass doors Windows and sliding doors are other common entry points for burglars. Make sure to keep these points of access securely locked, particularly when you are away or during the night. Use window locks on all accessible windows and place bars or wooden dowels on sliding doors' tracks to hinder movement. Moreover, consider using window film or security screens to make it more difficult for criminals to break the glass and gain access. 3. Use exterior lighting to ward off potential robbers A well-lit exterior can act as a deterrent for potential intruders as it increases their risk of being seen and caught. By illuminating the entry points to your home and creating a sense of activity, burglars may think twice before attempting to trespass. Install motion-sensor lights around your property to ensure that any movement near your house triggers the lights. This sudden change in lighting may startle intruders and persuade them to flee. Solar-powered lights are an eco-friendly and cost-effective option to consider in addition to traditional outdoor lighting systems. 4. Don't leave notes on the door Leaving notes on your door for family members, delivery personnel, or service providers can inadvertently signal to burglars that your home may be unoccupied, making it a more desirable target. While it may be convenient to communicate with others through notes, it is best to find alternative methods to get your message across, such as phone calls or text messages. If you have a smart security system, consider equipping it with a video doorbell, which allows you to communicate with visitors remotely and monitor your front door without leaving obvious visual cues for potential criminals. 5. Additional security measures Implementing additional measures, such as security cameras or alarm systems, can provide your home with an extra layer of protection. Security cameras can discourage potential intruders while also capturing evidence in the event of an actual break-in. Home alarm systems can alert you, your neighbors, and law enforcement of any unauthorized entry attempts, ensuring a rapid response in case of an emergency. Conclusion Protecting your home from potential intruders is an ongoing process that requires vigilance and a combination of security measures. Implementing the suggestions presented in this article—locking doors and windows, using exterior lighting, avoiding leaving notes on the door, and incorporating additional security systems—will help create a safer environment for you and your family. It is essential to maintain an open dialogue with family members and neighbors about security measures and strategies to ensure that everyone remains vigilant and committed to keeping your community safe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options:  A. danger  B. slow down  C. catch on fire  D. arrive late  E. carry freight A:","output":"Option C: Catch on fire Jane, being a pilot, would generally be responsible for safely flying an aircraft and its passengers or cargo. In this specific scenario, she has been praised for her quick thinking and received a medal and a promotion. This indicates that she must have been able to navigate through a crisis or an emergency situation skillfully, ensuring the safety of everyone on board. Option C - \\"catch on fire\\" - seems to be the most in line with this description, as it represents a potentially catastrophic event that could have occurred during her flight. The other options are not as strongly associated with a crisis situation or do not adequately demonstrate Jane's competence under pressure: A. Danger - This option is too vague and does not provide a specific issue or event. B. Slow down - While a pilot must be able to handle a variety of situations, slowing down a plane is a regular occurrence and does not necessarily involve quick thinking or problem-solving. D. Arrive late - It is neither an emergency situation that would require quick thinking nor a commendable action for which a pilot would be awarded a medal and promotion. E. Carry freight - This option is unrelated to the scenario presented, as carrying freight is a standard part of a pilot's job and not necessarily a situation requiring quick-thinking or crisis management.

Kenneth Duva Burke (May 5, 1897 - November 19, 1993) was an American literary theorist, as well as poet, essayist, and novelist, who wrote on 20th-century philosophy, aesthetics, criticism, and rhetorical theory. As a literary theorist, Burke was best known for his analyses based on the nature of knowledge. Furthermore, he was one of the first individuals to stray away from more traditional rhetoric and view literature as \\"symbolic action.\\" Burke was unorthodox, concerning himself not only with literary texts, but with the elements of the text that interacted with the audience: social, historical, political background, author biography, etc. Burke called the social and political rhetorical analysis \\"dramatism\\" and believed that such an approach to language analysis and language usage could help us understand the basis of conflict, the virtues and dangers of cooperation, and the opportunities of identification and consubstantiality.  Burke defined the rhetorical function of language as \\"a symbolic means of inducing cooperation in beings that by nature respond to symbols.\\" His definition of humanity states that \\"man\\" is \\"the symbol using, making, and mis-using animal, inventor of the negative, separated from his natural condition by instruments of his own making, goaded by the spirit of hierarchy, and rotten with perfection.\\" For Burke, some of the most significant problems in human behavior resulted from instances of symbols using human beings rather than human beings using symbols.  Burke proposed that when we attribute motives to others, we tend to rely on ratios between five elements: act, scene, agent, agency, and purpose. This has become known as the dramatistic pentad. The pentad is grounded in his dramatistic method, which considers human communication as a form of action. Dramatism \\"invites one to consider the matter of motives in a perspective that, being developed from the analysis of drama, treats language and thought primarily as modes of action\\" (Grammar of Motives xxii). Burke pursued literary criticism not as a formalistic enterprise but rather as an enterprise with significant sociological impact; he saw literature as \\"equipment for living,\\" offering folk wisdom and common sense to people and thus guiding the way they lived their lives. What exactly is dramatism?","output":"Dramatism is a rhetorical framework and method of analysis developed by Kenneth Burke that examines language and communication through a metaphorical lens, viewing them as symbolic actions performed by humans. The central concept of dramatism is that our lives and social interactions can be seen as an ongoing drama, and the language we use to express ourselves shapes these dramatic performances. The key elements of dramatism include: 1. Dramatistic Pentad: Burke proposed that human motives can be analyzed through the relationships among five elements: act (what was done), scene (the context or setting in which the act took place), agent (the person who performed the act), agency (the means or tools used to perform the act), and purpose (the reason behind the act). Understanding the interplay among these elements enables a deeper understanding of human behavior, intentions, and motivations. 2. Identification and Consubstantiality: According to Burke, one of the primary functions of rhetoric is to establish a sense of shared identity or consubstantiality among individuals. This process of identification allows people to put themselves in others' shoes, fostering empathy, compassion, and cooperation. However, identification can also lead to divisiveness and strife when different groups focus on their differences instead of finding common ground. 3. Terministic Screens: Burke argued that our understanding of reality is filtered through our language and the terms we use to describe it. These \\"terministic screens\\" shape our perceptions, influencing how we make sense of the world and the actions we take as a result. Thus, the language we use has significant implications for our motivations and behaviors. 4. Symbolic Action: In dramatism, all human actions can be understood as symbolic expressions of the values, beliefs, and attitudes that inform our thought processes. This approach emphasizes the importance of studying not just the content of texts, but also the broader social, political, and cultural contexts in which those texts are embedded. 5. \\"Equipment for Living\\": Burke saw literature and other forms of symbolic action as providing essential tools for navigating the complexities of human life. By engaging with stories, myths, and other cultural narratives, we learn important lessons about ourselves and the world, and we develop strategies for coping with the challenges that inevitably arise in our interpersonal relationships. By approaching communication and language through the lens of dramatism, Burke's theory provides a flexible and holistic method for understanding and interpreting human motives and actions. By acknowledging the impact of language and symbolism on our perceptions, values, and decisions, we can better appreciate the power of rhetoric and narrative in shaping our social reality."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Process:  - Energy builds up in the crust of the earth - The energy causes the fault lines give way - The earth&#x27;s plates move - The energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions - The seismic waves shake the earth as they move through it.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there was no earthquake happens, how will it affect pressure builds up until it is released.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"In the given process, energy building up in the earth's crust is a crucial factor in the occurrence of an earthquake. If we assume that no earthquake happens, then we can analyze how this perturbation might affect the pressure build-up and its release. To understand the effect of the perturbation, we follow a series of steps: Step 1: Identify the source of pressure build-up As energy accumulates in the Earth's crust, it puts increasing pressure on the rocks and geological structures surrounding the fault lines. This pressure build-up is primarily due to the movement of tectonic plates. Step 2: Analyze the effect of no earthquake occurrence If there is no earthquake in this scenario, the perturbation is that the fault lines do not give way, which implies that the Earth's plates do not move. This means that the energy continues to accumulate in the crust and it does not radiate outward as seismic waves. Step 3: Consider the consequences of energy accumulation With the continuous build-up of energy in the crust and the absence of any release mechanism (i.e., an earthquake), the potential for a pressure release must still exist as energy cannot be destroyed. However, due to our perturbation, it is not being released in the form of seismic activity. Step 4: Assess possible alternative release mechanisms Without an earthquake, the accumulated pressure in the Earth's crust must find another way to release. This could lead to a stable situation where the pressure is somehow evenly distributed and does not cause any significant geological events. Alternatively, the pressure might continue to increase until it is released in an even more powerful earthquake in the future or through another type of geological event, such as volcanic activity (if the built-up energy is able to trigger it). In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of no earthquake occurring does have an effect on the process, as it prevents the release of pressure in the form of seismic activity. This could lead to a stable situation or, conversely, the pressure might accumulate and be released in a future event with potentially more significant consequences. The perturbation, therefore, has both direct (preventing fault line movement) and indirect (potentially affecting future geological events) effects on the process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Joyce has just married a young man named Paul Webster (Richard Crane). Aboard their honeymoon train, Paul receives a telegram and, in a panic, immediately leaves the train to make a phone call. When the train pulls out, Paul is missing, having vanished without a word to Joyce. Throughout the following months, Joyce employs private detectives and conducts her own search for her husband to no avail, until one day, she discovers the address of the Cypresses Plantation that Paul entered on his college enrollment forms. Joyce takes the next train to the desolate whistle-stop town of Bayou Landing in the heart of Louisiana swamp country. While waiting forlornly at the rail station, she notices a large crate marked to be containing radioactive cobalt. Surmising no one would leave such cargo alone long, she stays by it and meets Mannon (Lon Chaney Jr.), a handyman at the Cypresses who came to pick up the cobalt. She asks him to drive her there and he obliges. As they proceed deeper in the swamps, Joyce is horrified when Mannon tries to run over an alligator and then exhibits the hook where a gator bit off his hand. At the plantation, Joyce introduces herself to Lavinia Hawthorne (Frieda Inescort), the Cypressesâ stern mistress. When Joyce suggests that Paul once lived at the plantation, Lavinia bristles and calls her a liar and tries to have her thrown out.

Write highlights for this article: One of the deepest mysteries in science - where all the antimatter went after the Big Bang and therefore why there’s matter at all in the universe  – is a step closer to being solved, claim CERN researchers. It comes because they’ve reached an important milestone in being able to make precision comparisons between atoms of ordinary matter and atoms of antimatter. ‘We’ve demonstrated that we can probe the internal structure of the antihydrogen atom,’ said team spokesman, Jeffrey Hangst, ‘and we’re very excited about that. We now know that it’s possible to design experiments to make detailed measurements of antiatoms.’ SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS. Hi-tech: The CERN Alpha experiment uses cutting-edge equipment to trap antihydrogen atoms. Today, we live in a Universe that appears to be made entirely of matter, yet at the Big Bang, matter and antimatter would have existed in equal amounts. The mystery is that all the antimatter seems to have gone, leading to the conclusion that nature must have a slight preference for matter over antimatter. If antihydrogen atoms can be studied in detail they may provide a powerful tool for investigating this preference, as the results from CERN’s Alpha collaboration suggest. Hydrogen atoms consist of an electron orbiting a nucleus. By firing light at them the atoms can be excited, with the electrons jumping to higher orbits, and eventually relaxing back to their so-called ground state by emitting light. The frequency distribution of the light emitted forms a very precisely measured spectrum that, in the matter world, is unique to hydrogen. Pioneering: Professor Jeffrey Hangst at the Alpha experiment. Leap forward: Professor Hangst explained that his experiment means antimatter can now be better understood. Basic principles of physics say that antihydrogen should have an identical spectrum to hydrogen, and measuring this spectrum is the ultimate goal of the Alpha collaboration. ‘Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe and we understand its structure extremely well,’ said Hangst. ‘Now we can finally begin to coax the truth out of antihydrogen. Are they different?  We can confidently say that time will tell.’ In a paper published today in Nature, Alpha reports the first, albeit modest, measurement of the antihydrogen spectrum. In the Alpha apparatus, antihydrogen atoms are trapped by a sophisticated arrangement of magnetic fields acting on the magnetic orientation of the antihydrogen atoms. By shining microwaves with a precisely tuned frequency on the antihydrogen atoms, the collaboration flips the antiatoms’ magnetic orientation, thereby liberating antihydrogen from the trap. When this happens, the antihydrogen meets ordinary matter and annihilates, leaving a characteristic pattern in particle detectors surrounding the trap. This measurement shows that it is possible to set up experiments in which the internal properties of antihydrogen atoms can be changed by shining microwaves on them. In the near future, Alpha will work at improving the precision of the microwave measurements, and undertake complementary measurements of the antihydrogen spectrum using lasers.","output":"1.

Given the question: This article: Lazar Markovich Lissitzky (Russian: Ла́зарь Ма́ркович Лиси́цкий, listen ; November 23 [O.S. November 11] 1890 – December 30, 1941), known as El Lissitzky (Russian: Эль Лиси́цкий, Yiddish: על ליסיצקי‎), was a Russian artist, designer, photographer, typographer, polemicist and architect. He was an important figure of the Russian avant-garde, helping develop suprematism with his mentor, Kazimir Malevich, and designing numerous exhibition displays and propaganda works for the Soviet Union. His work greatly influenced the Bauhaus and constructivist movements, and he experimented with production techniques and stylistic devices that would go on to dominate 20th-century graphic design.Lissitzky's entire career was laced with the belief that the artist could be an agent for change, later summarized with his edict, \\"das zielbewußte Schaffen\\" (goal-oriented creation). Lissitzky, of Lithuanian Jewish оrigin, began his career illustrating Yiddish children's books in an effort to promote Jewish culture in Russia. When only 15 he started teaching, a duty he would maintain for most of his life. Over the years, he taught in a variety of positions, schools, and artistic media, spreading and exchanging ideas. He took this ethic with him when he worked with Malevich in heading the suprematist art group UNOVIS, when he developed a variant suprematist series of his own, Proun, and further still in 1921, when he took up a job as the Russian cultural ambassador to Weimar Germany, working with and influencing important figures of the Bauhaus and De Stijl movements during his stay. In his remaining years he brought significant innovation and change to typography, exhibition design, photomontage, and book design, producing critically respected works and winning international acclaim for his exhibition design.

They are commonly found on items such as rotting logs.   Q: Slime molds are fungus-like protists that grow as slimy masses on what?   Choices:  - recycled matter  - food matter  - dark matter  - decaying matter  A: Answer:","output":"Slime molds are fungus-like protists that grow as slimy masses on decaying matter. Slime molds belong to the group of organisms known as protists, which are eukaryotic and can be unicellular or multicellular but are not classified as plants, animals, or fungi. While slime molds exhibit fungus-like characteristics, they are distinct from fungi in several ways. One significant difference is that slime molds are motile and can move, whereas fungi are mostly stationary. These slime molds grow as slimy masses, which are often brightly colored, on decaying matter, specifically decomposing plant material. They play essential roles in ecosystems due to their ability to break down and consume dead plant matter. By doing so, they recycle nutrients and contribute to the natural process of decomposition, transforming organic waste material into more simple substances that can be used by other organisms in the environment. This process helps maintain balance and nutrient availability in ecosystems where they are found. Common habitats for slime molds include rotting logs, damp soil, and leaf litter on the forest floor. These locations offer suitable environments for the growth and development of slime molds since they provide an abundance of decaying plant matter and moisture. In summary, slime molds are fungus-like protists that grow as slimy masses on decaying matter. They play crucial roles in ecosystems, aiding in decomposition and nutrient recycling, with rotting logs and damp soil being some common places for them to thrive.

Last summer, he was studying the evolution of two different salamander species, species A and species B. Species A salamander was Gold-striped salamander while species B salamander was fire salamander. He found it interesting that they took different approaches to adapt to different habitats.  and a hint : Consider the antlers of the Irish elk, (often supposed to be far too large; in deer antler size has an allometric relationship to body size). Obviously, antlers serve positively for defence against predators, and to score victories in the annual rut. But they are costly in terms of resource. Their size during the last glacial period presumably depended on the relative gain and loss of reproductive capacity in the population of elks during that time. As another example, camouflage to avoid detection is destroyed when vivid coloration is displayed at mating time. Here the risk to life is counterbalanced by the necessity for reproduction.Stream-dwelling salamanders, such as Caucasian salamander or Gold-striped salamander have very slender, long bodies, perfectly adapted to life at the banks of fast small rivers and mountain brooks. Elongated body protects their larvae from being washed out by current. However, elongated body increases risk of desiccation and decreases dispersal ability of the salamanders; it also negatively affects their fecundity. As a result, fire salamander, less perfectly adapted to the mountain brook habitats, is in general more successful, have a higher fecundity and broader geographic range.  Please answer this question : Which species would be more successful in reproduction, Species A or species B? A:","output":"In terms of reproductive success, species B, the fire salamander, would be more successful compared to species A, the Gold-striped salamander. While both species have evolved different adaptations to survive in their respective habitats, the fire salamander benefits from several factors that contribute to its reproductive success. First, the fire salamander is less perfectly adapted to mountain brook habitats than the Gold-striped salamander, which means that it has a more general and versatile set of adaptations. This allows the fire salamander to access a broader range of habitats, thereby increasing its chances of finding a suitable mate and reproducing. The wider geographic range of the fire salamander means that it can successfully reproduce in a variety of environments, allowing the population to grow and expand. Second, the Gold-striped salamander's elongated body, while helpful in protecting its larvae from being washed away by currents, comes at a cost. The increased risk of desiccation and decreased dispersal ability negatively impact the survivability and reproductive success of the species. The elongated body also affects the fecundity of the species, meaning that the Gold-striped salamander will generally produce fewer offspring than the fire salamander. Lastly, the fire salamander's higher fecundity plays a crucial role in its reproductive success. The species is able to produce more offspring than the Gold-striped salamander, increasing the population size and overall fitness of the species. These offspring will then grow up to reproduce themselves, further perpetuating the success of species B. Taking these factors into consideration, species B, the fire salamander, would be more successful in reproduction than species A, the Gold-striped salamander. Of course, it's essential to remember that both species have survived and adapted to their particular environments, demonstrating the dynamic nature of evolution and species success. However, considering the specific characteristics mentioned above, the fire salamander has a greater chance of maintaining and expanding its population due to its reproductive advantages."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: The film begins in January 1793 as a 17-year-old Hornblower joins a ship of the line, Justinian. Hornblower is introduced to his shipmates, one of whom is the ruthless Jack Simpson, who rules the midshipman's berth as the bully he is.Hornblower becomes suicidal under Simpson's malignant rule and finally finds opportunity to challenge him to a duel. An older midshipman, Clayton, feels guilty that he himself has not stood against Simpson. He knocks Hornblower unconscious, takes his place in the duel and is killed. Simpson, on the other hand, recovers to fight another day.Hornblower goes on to join the frigate, Indefatigable, under the command of Captain Pellew. Midshipmen Kennedy, Hether, and Cleveland go with him, as well as Simpson's old division which, due to Pellew's ire, becomes Hornblower's division. Hornblower's conduct under the pressure of battle eventually wins the respect and loyalty of these men.Simpson joins Indefatigable (known by her crew as the Indy) when Justinian is sunk by a rogue French ship called Papillon. The Indy and her crew take on a cutting out expedition into the Gironde, take Papillon, and sail to rejoin Indefatigable. During the operation, Simpson attempts the murder of Hornblower, and sets Kennedy adrift.The French Ship, Papillon, now in the hands of the British, is sailing back to the Indy when the Indy comes under fire from three French ships. On the way back to the Indy, the Papillon comes under fire from shore batteries, killing the two officers superior to Hornblower, Lt. Eccleston and Lt. Chadd. Shortly before the most senior officer (Eccleston) dies, he tells Hornblower to take command. Simpson attempts to challenge Hornblower's authority, but Hornblower tells Mr Bowles (the ship's master), that if Mr Simpson resists \\"you have my permission to shoot him\\". Simpson is then taken below whilst the Papillon sails back to the Indy.The Indy is now taking heavy fire from the three French ships, and Hornblower orders the Papillon not to lower her French colours. The Papillon then engages the French ships forcing them to surrender. After the battle, Mr Simpson and Hornblower are called to Captain Pellew's cabin. Accused by Hornblower of attempted murder, Simpson challenges him to a second duel, which Hornblower accepts (after receiving permission from Pellew).In this second duel, which takes place on a beach, Simpson shoots at Hornblower before the combatants are actually told to fire. Simpson claims, dubiously, that it was a misfire, running forward to see if his opponent is still alive. But Hornblower is not badly injured. Simpson is then told that he must stand his ground and take fire. Faced with this prospect, Simpson pleads pathetically to Hornblower for his life, revealing himself for the coward he is. Hornblower fires into the air, claiming that shooting the now defenseless Simpson is \\"not worth the powder\\". Smarting at this insult, Simpson attempts to knife Hornblower, but is shot dead just before he reaches him by Captain Pellew, who is standing concealed on a cliff above the beach.As the film draws to its end, Captain Pellew tells Hornblower precisely how impressed he has been by his actions. Pellew anticipates that Hornblower has a great career ahead of him, if he continues as he has begun., Question: Who shoots and kills Simpson?

Plot title: Count Dracula Movie plot: The story starts with a shot of Count Dracula's castle and the following text: Over fifty years ago, Bram Stoker wrote the greatest of all horror stories. Now, for the first time, we retell exactly as he wrote, one of the first â and still the best â tales of the macabre. Jonathan Harker, a lawyer traveling from London to Transylvania to secure property for Count Dracula, arrives at Bistritz to stay for the night. There, he is warned by a concerned lady against continuing his journey the following day. Harker believes that her concerns are rooted in peasant superstition. He ignores her, but starts to feel increasingly unnerved by the way everyone looks at him. Harker sets off for the rest of his journey and arrives at the Borgo Pass where he's picked up by the Count's mysterious coachman. Harker debarks at Castle Dracula, and the coach immediately rushes off. Somewhat hesitantly, Harker approaches the main door, whereupon a thin, tall, gaunt old man opens it. Harker asks, \\"Count Dracula?\\" \\"I am Dracula, enter freely and of your own will,\\" says the man at the door. Dracula takes Harker to his bedchamber where Harker notices that Dracula casts no reflection. Later, Harker goes to sleep. He wakes in an ancient crypt where he is seduced by three beautiful vampiresses. Dracula rushes into the room in a rage and orders them to leave Harker alone. Dracula explains, \\"This man belongs to me,\\" then gives the vampiresses a baby to feed on. Harker wakes up screaming in his room and assumes it was a nightmare, but two small wounds on his neck indicate otherwise. Harker soon realises he is a prisoner, and tries to escape by climbing out of his bedroom window. He finds his way back to the crypt where Count Dracula and his three brides rest in coffins. Harker runs out of the crypt screaming, and jumps out of the castle's tower into the river below. Harker wakes up in a private psychiatric clinic outside London, owned by Dr. Van Helsing, in the care of Dr. Seward. He is told he was found delirious in a river near...

These days, unfortunately, my spa trips are few and far between. I blame the damn kids for that one! So, as you can imagine, I was pretty damn excited when the in-laws presented me with an Urban Spa voucher for the Urban Indulgence package: one hour hot stone Lomi Lomi massage followed by a Heavenly Spa Facial - two hours on indulgent bliss, for Christmas. I had never had a hot stone massage before so was very much looking forward to this, if nothing else out of curiosity about what is involved. Whenever you see pictures advertising a hot stone massage, the beautiful model always has a bunch of largish stones on her back so I wasn't sure whether it was more an acupressure experience where they left the stones strategically placed on the back to work their magic or whether it was an actual massage.  Turns out that it is an actual massage. I requested a firm massage as my back has really been giving me issues. Carrying 15kgs of Crazy Kid or 9kgs of Kiki (or 26kgs of double babies) really isn't too good for the back so it had been causing me problems for a couple of months. My therapist (the lovely Kristy) gave me an expertly firm massage and used a small, smooth hot stone, along with her hands, to perform the massage. It was quite a unique experience as one minute I could sense that she was using her hands to do the massage then then next I'd get a sweep of hotness as the stone was run over me. It really was a delightful sensory experience. As my back was a problem area, Kristy spent 30 minutes just on that then the other 30 minutes was spent on the rest of my body. I could feel myself drifting in and out of consciousness throughout the massage. One really special thing about this massage was that the massage table was heated. Such a small touch, but one that was greatly appreciated (although it was a great contributor to my lack of consciousness!).

Rushing here and there, being constantly on call, balancing multiple layers of responsibility may give you a sense of accomplishment – even make you feel important, but it takes a huge toll on every aspect of life. When you constantly push yourself to take on more and more challenges, it is easy to lose sight of why you wanted to be successful in the first place. For many, the reason was to be able to spend less time working and enjoy life more.  A frenetic, high-pressure lifestyle creates exactly the opposite. There is a very dark side to constantly pushing yourself to produce more and more. Unfortunately, it creeps up on you and becomes a serious case of self-negligence. When you are busy and driven every minute of every day and well into the evening, it is easy to neglect important things in life that keep you healthy, happy, and create quality of life.  A continual stream of urgent tasks that must be completed will overshadow the not-so-urgent, but important activities that make life worth living. It is not just physical well-being that is neglected – mental and emotional well-being also suffer when there is no time for self-care. When your daily schedule is crammed to overflowing one of the first areas of neglect is your diet. Eating regular, nutritious meals become a thing of the past. You are not only too busy to sleep or even take a deep breath now and then, there is no time to prepare decent meals Convenience foods, frozen dinners, take out and fast foods become the norm. It is a steady diet of additive filled, sugar and fat-filled dishes, loaded with empty calories that provide minimal nutrition and damage the body. It is impossible to sustain any level of good health on such a diet. Question: What bad effect does being busy bring? === The answer to the above question is pick from the following.

If so, hope you remember the evening. Seventeen men and women have been charged in Florida in what prosecutors say was a scam targeting tourists looking for after-dark fun that played out in these and other private clubs, according to an Associated Press report. The con: \\"B-Girls\\" (slang for women at bars whose job is to encourage customers to spend a lot of money) enticed victims to South Beach private clubs where they were charged sky-high prices for Champagne and other drinks. The story said that women -- most from Russia and neighboring Eastern European countries -- would chat up tourists and businessmen in legitimate nightspots, looking for those who seemed to have money to spend. Then the women invited their victims to the \\"private clubs,\\" where drinks flowed and credit cards took big hits. Women would pour drinks into buckets or planters to get the men to buy more, The Miami Herald says. \\"Some victims are so intoxicated by the drinks forced upon them by the B-Girls that they cannot stand and are not competent enough to sign credit card receipts,\\" FBI agent Alexander V. Tiguy said in an affidavit quoted in the story. \\"Those victims are propped up by the B-Girls long enough to obtain signatures.\\" I tried to call three clubs listed on the main South Beach drag of Washington Avenue. One had no phone number I could find, one had a disconnected number and one had only an answering machine with no business name on it. Prosecutors say at least 88 victims have been identified with total losses in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. One victim was gouged 43,000, the AP reports. Some of the accused are being held without bail and one top operative is believed to have fled the country, the story said. U.S. Attorney Wifredo Ferrer told the AP that such scams could give \\"our tourism industry a black eye. We are pleased to have put this ring out of operation.\\" (My colleague Cathy Grossman, a former Floridian, says that B-girls have always been a part of the South Florida scene. She reminds me that the former Poodle Lounge at the Fontainebleau resort, where the Rat Pack partied, was a big hangout for ladies waiting to meet rich gents and conventioneers and that any female sitting solo at the bar was suspect. However, I'm pretty sure 43,000 tabs weren't rung up there.) Readers, has anyone heard of this scam or of anything similar in another pleasure capital, Las Vegas?

Passage: Big Butte Creek drains approximately 245 square miles (635 km2) of southern Oregon. Elevations range from 1,562 feet (476.1 m) at the creek's mouth to 9,495 feet (2,894 m) at the summit of Mount McLoughlin, with an average of 3,528 feet (1,075 m). About 56 percent is federally owned by the Bureau of Land Management and the United States Forest Service, 44 percent is privately owned, and a small fraction belongs to the City of Medford.The Big Butte Creek watershed experiences a Mediterranean climate. Temperatures range from 10 °F (−12 °C) in the winter to 100 °F (38 °C) in the summer. Precipitation averages between 35 and 80 inches (890 and 2,000 mm) annually. Most precipitation occurs between November and March. Nine percent of the watershed's surface runoff is collected from rain, 35 percent from rain on snow, and 56 percent from snow. The watershed contains the largest groundwater source in the entire Rogue River basin; one major outlet is at Big Butte Springs.The watershed is split into two geographic regions: the High Cascades and the Western Cascades, both volcanic in origin. The Western Cascades compose the western two thirds of the watershed. This region is highly eroded, being between 17 and 38 million years old. Its unstable slopes are primarily made of pyroclastic rock. Due to the rock's high ability to absorb moisture, earthflows are common. The High Cascades are much younger, around three to seven million years old.

By Daily Mail Reporter PUBLISHED: 23:12 EST, 27 December 2013 | UPDATED: 05:03 EST, 28 December 2013 It is said that to be a truly great photobomber you must first be an artist. So in a year when the art of photobombing was added to the Oxford Dictionary ('a photograph that has been spoiled by the unexpected appearance of an unintended subject in the cameraâ€™s field of view as the picture was taken') it should come as little surprise that some of the best spoiled photos came from celebrities. In Hollywood, photobombing has become a tit-for-tat game amongs the stars, especially at big awards events, when the opportunities to intrude a photo are endless in a sea of cameras. Arguably the most famous of the year: During a concert, OPTIONS: - 1D notices a fan taking a selfie and ducks down to be part of it - Daily Mail notices a fan taking a selfie and ducks down to be part of it - Hollywood notices a fan taking a selfie and ducks down to be part of it - Oxford Dictionary notices a fan taking a selfie and ducks down to be part of it - PUBLISHED notices a fan taking a selfie and ducks down to be part of it - Photobombs notices a fan taking a selfie and ducks down to be part of it - Queen B notices a fan taking a selfie and ducks down to be part of it - Tumblr notices a fan taking a selfie and ducks down to be part of it - UPDATED notices a fan taking a selfie and ducks down to be part of it","output":"Arguably the most famous of the year: During a concert, Queen B notices a fan taking a selfie and ducks down to be part of it. This iconic moment quickly became viral on social media, which led to a surge of activity for fans who couldn't help but share the humorous image. Beyoncé, affectionately known as Queen B, had swiftly and skillfully made her way into the unsuspecting fan's photo, effectively turning it into an unforgettable photobomb. With her magnetic charisma and signature smile, this candid moment was undoubtedly a highlight of the year, showcasing a relatable, lighthearted side that stars rarely share with the public. Photobombing wasn't just limited to the music industry, however, as actors, athletes, and even politicians took advantage of opportunities to steal the spotlight. From awards shows to red carpets, sporting events to charity galas, 2013 saw an increase in this phenomenon that quickly gained traction across the globe. Fans reveled in collecting these candid moments, delighting in the playful side of their favorite personalities. Additionally, the trend seemed to bridge the gap between fans and celebrities, allowing for a sense of camaraderie and familiarity often missing from fame's aloof facade. As smartphones and portable cameras continue to perpetuate the ever-growing thirst for candid snapshots, it's easy to see why photobombing has enjoyed such a meteoric rise in popularity. With a little whimsy and the element of surprise, photobombing appears to be a winning combination for both the prankster and their unwitting subject. And while the term was only formally recognized as an official part of the English language with its addition to the Oxford Dictionary in 2013, it's clear that the trend is here to stay. As we look back on a year filled with unforgettable moments, it's impossible to deny the impact that photobombing has had on both popular culture and celebrity interactions. From Queen B's triumphant concert selfie to many other instances of stars taking a bite out of the photobombing craze, it's clear that this unique form of expression has struck a chord with fans and celebrities alike. And as we eagerly await a new year of candid gems, it's safe to say that photobombing has effectively proven itself to be an art form all its own."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer based on context: The Jets played a rare road game at home, as they took on their intracity rivals (and stadium co-tenants), the New York Giants. Both offenses were slow to start through the first quarter, though the Jets' defense capitalized when Giants running back Brandon Jacobs fumbled at his own 11-yard line, which was picked up by safety Kerry Rhodes for a touchdown. The Jets had a chance to extend the lead later in the period, but Mike Nugent missed a 42-yard field goal. The Giants responded on the ensuing drive with an eight-yard touchdown by Derrick Ward. The deadlock was broken toward the end of the first half when Chad Pennington led the Jets on a 93-yard drive with less than two minutes in the half, ending on a 16-yard touchdown pass to Brad Smith. The Jets were able to tack on a 47-yard field goal by Nugent to end the half, after they got the ball back on an interception of Giants quarterback Eli Manning by Jonathan Vilma, taking a 17-7 lead into the locker room. The Giants went to work when they opened the second half, getting a 19-yard touchdown run from Jacobs to cut the Jets' lead to three. The lead was restored back to ten, however, when Leon Washington returned the ensuing kickoff 98&#160;yards for a touchdown. Later in the quarter, Manning led the Giants downfield and completed a 13-yard pass to tight end Jeremy Shockey for a touchdown. Pennington attempted to respond by leading the Jets deep into Giants territory early in the fourth quarter, but he floated a pass toward the end zone which was intercepted at the two-yard line by cornerback Aaron Ross. Despite the bad field position, Manning eventually found Plaxico Burress on a 53-yard touchdown pass to put the Giants ahead, 28-24. The Jets tried to get back ahead later in the period, but Pennington was intercepted again by Ross (Pennington's third of the afternoon), who took it 43&#160;yards for what was effectively the game-sealing touchdown. One last attempt by the Jets to score yielded no positive yardage, and the Giants ran out the clock to preserve the victory. What all touchdown passes did Eli Manning make?","output":"Alright kiddo, in that game Eli Manning, the quarterback for the New York Giants, threw two touchdown passes. The first one was a 13-yard pass to Jeremy Shockey, who is a tight end. The second one was a 53-yard pass to Plaxico Burress, a wide receiver. These touchdowns helped the Giants win the game against the Jets!"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Answer this question: who was the prime minister of bulgaria from 1950 to 1956??","output":"From 1950 to 1956, the Prime Minister of Bulgaria was Valko Chervenkov, who was a Bulgarian communist politician and an important figure in the Bulgarian government during the early years of the Cold War. His full name was Valko Chervenkov Valkov, born on September 15, 1900, in Zlatitsa, Bulgaria, and passed away on October 21, 1980, in Sofia, Bulgaria. Valko Chervenkov originally worked as a teacher. However, he later adopted communist ideologies and joined the Bulgarian Communist Party (BCP) in 1919. Over the years, he climbed up the ranks within the party, working as editor for different party newspapers and traveling to the Soviet Union to learn about its policies. In the early 1930s, Chervenkov was forced to flee Bulgaria due to his communist activities and took up refuge in Moscow.  During World War II, Chervenkov was a member of the Soviet intelligence service, which added significant weight to his resume. Following the end of World War II, as Bulgaria fell under Soviet influence, Chervenkov, with his Soviet connections, started to become a prominent figure in the country. In 1949, after the death of Georgi Dimitrov, who was the first leader of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, Chervenkov assumed the role of the first secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party. Valko Chervenkov became the Prime Minister of Bulgaria in 1950. As the Prime Minister, Chervenkov adopted a strong pro-Stalinist stance, following in the footsteps of his predecessor. This period is often referred to as the \\"Chervenkov era.\\" During his term, Chervenkov promoted industrialization, education, and cultural growth. Despite these positive initiatives, there were several suppressions of opposition, restrictions on civil liberties, and persecution of religious institutions that occurred during his tenure. The Chervenkov era was marked by an intense personality cult, as people were expected to laud the Prime Minister for all his contributions to the nation. After Joseph Stalin's death in 1953, the Soviet Union went through a period of political changes, and Nikita Khrushchev ascended to power. This transition impacted leading communist figures in Bulgaria, including Chervenkov. In 1954, Chervenkov was removed from his position as the first secretary of the BCP, and Todor Zhivkov replaced him. However, Chervenkov continued to hold his position as the Prime Minister until 1956. That year, with the Soviet Union's political climate shifting towards de-Stalinization, Chervenkov was pushed out of power, and Anton Yugov replaced him as the Prime Minister of Bulgaria. Chervenkov's removal marked the end of his political influence. After his forced resignation, he was appointed the Minister of Public Education, a role he held until being relieved of all government duties in 1961."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:I read this background article the other day: Noble gases are also used to fill the glass tubes of lighted signs like the one in the Figure below . Although noble gases are chemically nonreactive, their electrons can be energized by sending an electric current through them. When this happens, the electrons jump to a higher energy level. When the electrons return to their original energy level, they give off energy as light. Different noble gases give off light of different colors. Neon gives off reddish-orange light, like the word “Open” in the sign below. Krypton gives off violet light and xenon gives off blue light.  I am facing a new situation today: A scientist named Kathy walks into her office to see two neon signs plugged into the wall and hanging above her desk. Confused, she looks around to see if there's any clue as to who put them there. Seeing nobody, she flips the light switch on and walks in. Upon flipping the light switch, only the large sign lights up. Even though they are clearly both plugged in, the small sign isn't turning on. Kathy leaves her office to find someone to ask who put these random signs up in her room.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Are the electrons in the small sign more or less energized than the large sign's electrons? A:","output":"Based on the new situation and the background article, the electrons in the small sign are less energized than the large sign's electrons. The large sign lights up when the light switch is turned on, which means an electric current is being sent through the noble gas in the glass tube, energizing the electrons and producing light as they return to their original energy level. Since the small sign does not light up even though it is plugged in, it implies that for some reason an electric current is not being sent through the gas, possibly due to a malfunction or issue with the circuitry. Therefore, the electrons in the small sign are not being energized to the same extent as the electrons in the large sign, resulting in the lack of emitted light."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q: (CNN)A leader of pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region said Friday he is not interested in a truce with the Ukrainian government in Kiev because his troops are on the offensive. \\"Since we're attacking, there is no sense to have peace talks now,\\" Aleksandr Zakharchenko, leader of the self-proclaimed People's Republic of Donetsk, said in a meeting with university students, according to his media office. \\"We've made this mistake before. It's not decent to repeat it,\\" he said. Thousands have been killed in months of conflict between the rebels and Ukrainian troops, and a ceasefire agreed to in September crumbled long ago. Zakharchenko's comments came two days after the foreign ministers of Ukraine and Russia met in Berlin to discuss a way out of the violence. But Zakharchenko showed no interest in the talks. \\"There will be no attempts from our side to talk about the ceasefire,\\" he said, reported Russian state news agency RIA. \\"We will be on the offensive until we reach the border of Donetsk region.\\" He said that he was interested in cooperating with Ukraine on prisoner exchanges. \\"We need to get our guys who've been captured,\\" he said, according to RIA. Despite the talks in Berlin, violence in the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine shows no signs of abating. Power is out in and around Luhansk after militants shelled a power plant there, Luhansk regional official Hennady Moskal told Ukraine's state-run Ukrinform news agency. Moskal noted that the local water supply and boilers are off, and trolley buses aren't operating. Thursday's shelling of a transit stop in Donetsk city -- an attack that Ukraine's Defense Ministry blamed on rebels -- killed eight civilians, according to state news reports. But Ukrainian troops have come under heavy fire, as well. That includes 115 attacks in a recent 24-hour period that killed three troops and wounded 50 more, Ukrinform reported Friday. The news agency said that \\"Russian-terrorist troops\\" faced off with Ukrainian soldiers Thursday along Bakhumtka Highway, even posting a picture that showed a man with stripes on his clothing, suggesting that he was part of the Russian military. This is in line with Kiev's repeated assertions that Russia has not only actively supported rebels with arms, but has sent its own troops across the border to battle Ukrainian forces. On Wednesday, for instance, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said that \\"more than 9,000 Russian troops (crossed) our Russian-Ukrainian border, bring with them hundreds and hundreds of tanks, armed personnel carriers, and killing Ukrainian civilians and attacking Ukrainian troops.\\" Claims that Russian forces entered Ukraine 'complete rubbish,' Russia says . Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov promptly responded to this assertion with a firm denial, much like other denials made by Russian officials in recent months over similar allegations of armed intervention. \\"As to the flow of troops and armaments, this is not the first time we hear something like that,\\" he said. \\"And each time I hear that, I say if you're so confident about that, please present us with facts, but no one has been able to provide us with these facts.\\" Russian forces, equipment enter Ukraine, PM says . Pro-Russian separatists have claimed control of parts of eastern Ukraine since the spring of 2014, despite a push by Ukrainian forces to defeat them. From mid-April to January 21, the conflict had killed at least 5,086 people and injured at least 10,948 others, said the United Nations. \\"We fear that the real figure may be considerably higher,\\"  the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said about the death toll in a report released Friday. At least 262 people were killed in the fighting from January 13 through Wednesday alone, the report said. Unrest in Ukraine began with protests in the country's capital last year after President Viktor Yanukovych, favoring closer ties to Russia, dropped plans to sign a political and economic agreement with the European Union. After months of protests and days of deadly clashes between demonstrators and security personnel in Kiev, Parliament ousted Yanukovych in February. Weeks later, Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula. Then in April, violence broke out in two Ukrainian regions that border Russia -- Donetsk and Luhansk -- as separatist leaders declared independence from the government in Kiev.

Answer:","output":"Title: Useful but Needs Improvement Rating: ★★★☆☆ I have been using the com.google.android.gms (Google Play Services) app for a while now, and I believe it's time to share my thoughts on it. While this app has proved to be a quite helpful tool that powers Google-related features and functions on my device, there are still some concerns that I'd like to address, so I have decided to give it a 3-star rating. First of all, let's talk about the positives. The Google Play Services app handles several important tasks like authentication of Google services, synchronization of contacts, and access to the latest user privacy settings. This app also enhances the overall app experience by providing much-needed APIs for other apps that rely on Google's services for smooth operation. However, I've experienced some issues and drawbacks that could use some attention. For instance, I've noticed that the app occasionally consumes more battery than it should, leaving my device drained sooner than expected. Moreover, the frequent updates sometimes cause compatibility issues with other apps, resulting in crashes or slow performance. Another drawback is the lack of transparency and control over the services and features. For instance, it's challenging to disable specific features that I don't use or have more control over the data being shared with Google. In conclusion, while com.google.android.gms is an essential app for Android devices that offers many useful services, I believe there's room for improvement to make it more user-friendly and efficient. Optimizations in battery consumption, addressing compatibility issues, and providing users with more control over their data would significantly improve the app experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This article: Alice Kinney is the daughter of film director John Kinney, who made several prominent personal-focused films in his life but passed away some years ago. As she hits her fortieth birthday, Alice is currently separated from her husband Austen, who has stayed in New York in his role as a music producer while Alice has moved back into her father's Los Angeles home with her daughters, Isabel and Rosie, to be near to her mother, Lillian. Alice is also attempting to start her own interior design business. While out for a drink with her friends, Alice encounters Harry, George and Teddy, three aspiring filmmakers in LA to make a pitch to possible producers after a short film they presented at a film festival received positive acclaim. Despite the three being in their late twenties, they hit it off with Alice and her friends, with Alice nearly sleeping with Harry before he passes out from intoxication. The next morning, George discovers a room containing John Kinney's old scripts and awards and realizes Alice's family history just as Lillian, Isabel and Rosie return from the girls' night with their grandmother. Alice takes the girls to school while Lillian offers the young men breakfast, and is so won over by their compliments of John's old films that she offers them the guest house while they make their pitch. contains an answer for the question: What are the first names of the people who are offered breakfast?, what is it ?

Here is an article: Valerio Mezzanotti for The New York Times Eva Cavalli, Roberto Cavalli and Sharon Stone attend the amfAR dinner. More Photos » IF you have never seen Sharon Stone in the role of auctioneer, imagine her giving the performance of a lifetime, the part she was born to play. This is a woman who could shake a dime out of Ebenezer, as well as an extra holiday or two. So there was Ms. Stone on Saturday night at Milan Fashion Week, merely hours after Reuters reported she had been admitted to a hospital for a migraine suffered during the Fendi show, vamping in a black halter gown by Roberto Cavalli that resembled nothing more than a bra top with a skirt attached by panels of fringe. At a black-tie benefit for amfAR, the AIDS research foundation, she sold a Damien Hirst etching for 110,000, followed by a six-liter gold-leaf bottle of Moët & Chandon that someone bought for 20,000 and promptly returned for her to sell again. Wait, scratch that. Did Ms. Stone say dollars? That should have been euros! An M.C. constantly had to correct her all night. “Someone help the blonde with a pain problem,” Ms. Stone said, joking about herself, before turning to an aggressive bidder and adding, “I liked you from the moment I saw you.” Another bidder declined her advances, shaking his head. “Don’t give me that little Italian thing,” she said. “I don’t like it.” Out front, near the entrance to La Permanente gallery, the designer Kenneth Cole, who is the board chairman of amfAR, was sweating amid a throng of Italian actresses and socialites to make sure the arrivals went smoothly. Photographers went wild for Mr. Cavalli, chanting “Ro-bert-oh! Ro-bert-oh!” as if he were the goalie for Inter Milan. Mr. Cole, a tireless organizer of such fund-raising events, did not appear to relax for one moment. Does he ever have any fun at these things? “Fun is overrated,” he said. Mr. Cavalli, meanwhile, has been something of a Fashion Week gadfly, having picked a fight with Giorgio Armani over the politics of scheduling shows. He called Mr. Armani a “little king.” Mr. Armani told him to hush up. “We have to show what we have in our minds and our hearts and our fantasies to bring fashion back to Milan like it was 20 years ago,” Mr. Cavalli said. Actually, apart from the presence of newer designers like Dan and Dean Caten of the label DSquared, newer models like Jessica Stam and Lindsey Wixson, and a smattering of celebrities such as Solange Knowles (in a smashing white gown with an open back by Rubin Singer), this party was vintage 1992. Buckets of vodka and mixers were piled around velvet sofas bearing the Fendi logo, and crystal ashtrays were everywhere. So many people were smoking cigarettes at their tables that it became difficult to see across the room. Ms. Stone, in what must have been her second hour on stage, began to flag, her voice sounding more like that of an aging lounge singer than a temptress. At one point, she flopped down on a lip-shaped couch that was also for sale. The party raised more than 1.1 million for AIDS research in the end; Mr. Cavalli bought the couch for 35,000 euros. “This is what I’d like you to do,” Ms. Stone said. “I’d like you to get really drunk and flirt with someone at your table, because that’s what I’m going to do.” Then she took her seat, next to Mr. Cavalli.

Detailed Instructions: In this task you will be given a string that only contains single digit numbers spelled out. The input string will not contain spaces between the different numbers. Your task is to return the number that the string spells out. The string will spell out each digit of the number for example '1726' will be 'oneseventwosix' instead of 'one thousand seven hundred six'. Problem:twofivesixeightonesevenzerothree Solution:","output":"This problem is essentially asking to convert the spelled out single digit numbers into numeric form, without any spaces in between them. It seems that the input is a string composed of several instances of single digits written out in full in English (\\"one\\", \\"two\\", \\"three\\", etc.), linked together without spaces. The task is to convert these spelled out numbers back into the numerical representation. Guidelines: - The input will be a single string, without spaces. - The string will contain only English words for single digit numbers. - The goal is to return the number that these spelled out numbers form together, not considering them as separate entities but as digits of the same number. For example, \\"threetwo\\" should be converted to 32, not \\"3, 2\\". According to these guidelines, here is a solution to the task: 1. Create a dictionary where keys are the English words for numbers from zero to nine and values are respective numbers (0 to 9). \`\`\`python numbers_dict = {\\"zero\\": 0, \\"one\\": 1, \\"two\\": 2, \\"three\\": 3, \\"four\\": 4, \\"five\\": 5, \\"six\\": 6, \\"seven\\": 7, \\"eight\\": 8, \\"nine\\": 9} \`\`\` 2. Make a loop over the dictionary keys and replace every occurrence of the key in the input string with its corresponding value. \`\`\`python def spell_out_to_digit(s):     for word, number in numbers_dict.items():       s = s.replace(word, str(number))     return int(s) \`\`\` 3. Using this function for the problem we have: \`\`\`python print(spell_out_to_digit('twofivesixeightonesevenzerothree'))  # 25681703 \`\`\` This output is the correct translation of the concatenated low digits spelled out into its numeric form, by simply replacing each instance of spelled out low digits contained into the input string with the actual numeric digits they represent."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Tammy learned about fish reproduction.  But I can use this background: Fish reproduce sexually. They lay eggs that can be fertilized either inside or outside of the body. In most fish, the eggs develop outside of the mother's body. In the majority of these species, fertilization also takes place outside the mother's body. The male and female fish release their gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization occurs. Female fish release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization.

For starters, a kitschy spelling doesn't make you a German restaurant, and to be fair, I don't think that's what the owners had intended, so I think those that would judge this restaurant's German authenticity are a little off the mark. With that said, what I'm about to say may make a lot of fanboys and girls very upset, as I understand that Chef Curry is a star in the valley, and I've been to a few of his past endeavors and quite agree that the mans talents are undeniable...but for me and my party, Brat Haus seemed to have everything down except for the food.   The decor is a very cool blend of modernist artsy, and industrial minimalist. Very cool. The service might have been a stretched a little thin, like one reviewer also mentioned, we were sitting at one of the few tables inside, when most of the servers tables were presumably outside, and we felt a little bit like we were at the \\"kids\\" table during thanksgiving dinner...a little slapdash \\"heres your order and your check, thanks for coming.\\"   First, the good. There is no shame in the beer list. No shame, Weihenstephaner Hefe, yes please...anytime I can. La Fin du Monde from Unibrou? absolutely...and these are probably two of the most commercial beers out of their selection, so if you've never heard of them, you can imagine what kind of paradise lies waiting for the average beer geek. Just wish those beers had gotten to us a little sooner, and that we might have been asked if we wanted another round. Again, when your at the kids table, just a sip of thanksgiving wine is all you can hope for.  If we could rate the place on their beer and fries alone, this would be a whole different review. Belgian Fries, truffle aoli...they honestly couldn't have been more perfect.  But it should be about the brats, yes? Partly on our failure, we went straight to the out of the box gourmet section. We had the rattlesnake rippers (rattlesnake sausage) , and the duck duck dates (Date and duck sausage), our logic being we can make beer brats at home, (Damn good ones mind you, if I don't say so myself. but, I guess I just did.), point being we decided to forego the mundane and see what an accomplished Chef known for his skill with cured meats could whip up instead. This was in retrospect a mistake. Both the rattlesnake and the duck at the end of it all, had us craving some good ole beer brats instead.  We found these two dogs, uninspired and not nearly as exciting as the quirky names or exotic meats might suggest. The rattlesnake. tasting like dry chicken, was insufficiently seasoned, moist less, and awkwardly skinny in a consequently overwhelmingly sized bun. We could  taste neither duck nor dates, in the Duck, Duck Dates sausage, and we had already polished off the fries before the stark realization set in that these dogs were not going to get even close to filling us up. Sharing our disappointments with each other, our party tried to place our proverbial fingers on the source of our ennui, and realized that everything was under seasoned, and we had failed in choosing the appropriate toppings for our peculiar dogs. (You have to pick one before they arrive) We chose pickled red onions, and spicy peppers. We agreed that given the Chefs history, we would have liked to see more of an active hand in his condiment pairings, rather than see a short list of condiments to choose from, i.e....we recommend apricot onion chutney with the duck and date sausage, or better yet, not even a suggestion, but more of an insistence, showing the confidence to say, we know how this rattlesnake shows its best and thus have served it with this fill in the blank accouterment. Left to our own devices and not having known that we wouldn't have classic dog garnishment, i.e...ketchup, mustard, relish...we were left there with our skinny, dry, under seasoned wieners, some sad not so spicy peppers, which helped a little with flavor but not with the dryness...and nothing else.   Dessert was the Drunken Date Cake, which was so blasu00e9, it had us all hunger games dueling for the measly scoop of vanilla ice-cream melting at its side.  Total: 2 dogs, 2 beers, some fries, and one dessert: 43   Yelp rating system classifies 2 stars  as \\"meh, Ive had better\\" and really thats the best way to describe this experience. If you decide to check out brat haus, my advice is to skip the fancy for now, go straight for the classic, and enjoy some great beers. We however, chose not to take the chance on ordering more, and decided to go and get something to eat. Not something you necessarily want to have to think about as you're leaving a restaurant with 43 bucks less in your pockets, but the truth nonetheless. Choose: was this review given positively or negatively?

They mention that they felt they were at the \\"kids\\" table during their dinner, that the place was more about beer and fries than the brats, and that the rattlesnake and duck date sausage dishes were underwhelming.

Powell contended that it was not inconsistent to want to foster cooperation even with an organization like the Indonesian military, which has a history of human rights abuses. \\"If you get young officers, expose them to a military organization that is within a democratic political institution, such as the United States, then that rubs off on them,\\" he said. In Malaysia, Powell met with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who has led the country since 1981. The Malaysian foreign minister, Syed Hamid Albar, later told local reporters that Powell had proposed that American and Malaysian officials review the idea of forming a regional training center in Malaysia to coordinate antiterrorism activities. His brief stop in Malaysia also highlighted the moral ambiguities of the effort to prevent terrorism and its emphasis on cooperation with governments that the United States has often criticized. The United States once distanced itself from Mahathir for strong-arm tactics with political rivals, and human rights groups criticize him for arresting and jailing scores of suspected militants, including some who may be linked to al-Qaida, without trial. Powell said his discussions with Mahathir \\"touched on the case\\" of his former deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, who is serving a 15-year sentence on charges of sodomy and abuse of power after trials that Powell said the United States had \\"always felt\\" were flawed. The assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, James Kelly, met on Tuesday morning with Anwar's wife, Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, for what she later told Malaysian reporters was a discussion about both the detention of her husband and six supporters, and the campaign against terrorism.

Tammy wound up in the hospital and was diagnosed with a serious brain injury. Rob suffered only a mild concussion.  Which person had more trouble talking?  Hint: A person with a serious brain injury usually suffers permanent brain damage. These brain injuries usually occur when an external mechanical force, such as a violent blow or jolt to the head or body, causes brain dysfunction. An object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet or a shattered piece of the skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury. As a result, the person may have trouble talking or controlling body movements. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain was injured. Serious brain injuries can also cause personality changes and problems with mental abilities such as memory. Medicines, counseling, and other treatments may help people with serious brain injuries recover from, or at least learn to cope with, their disabilities. The answer is:","output":"Tammy had more trouble talking. Given her serious brain injury diagnosis, it is likely that she experienced significant impairments affecting her speech and communication abilities. On the other hand, Rob's mild concussion likely led to less severe symptoms that generally resolve on their own over time. Serious brain injuries can cause a range of problems, including talking difficulties, altered body movements, personality changes, and cognitive impairments.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Gennady Golovkin was born on April 8, 1982, in the city of Karaganda in the Kazakh SSR, Soviet Union (now Karagandy, Kazakhstan) to a Russian coal miner and Korean mother, who worked as an assistant in a chemical laboratory. He has three brothers, two elder named Sergey and Vadim and a twin, Max. Sergey and Vadim had encouraged Golovkin to start boxing when Golovkin was eight years old. As a youth, Golovkin would walk the streets with them, who went around picking fights for him with grown men. On July 20, 2012 it was announced that Golovkin would defend his titles against European champion and The Ring's #10-rated middleweight Grzegorz Proksa (28-1, 21 KOs) on September 1 at the Turning Stone Casino in Verona, New York. The fight was televised on HBO in the United States and Sky Sports in the UK. Golovkin put on an impressive performance in his American debut by battering Proksa to a fifth-round TKO, which was Proksa's first loss by knockout. Proksa praised Golovkin's power, \\"The guy hits like a hammer. I tried everything, but it did not work. You have to give him credit, because he had a good handle on the situation and it was an honor to meet him in the ring.\\" CompuBox Stats showed that Golovkin landed 101 of 301 punches thrown (34%) and Proksa landed 38 of his 217 thrown (18%).  In October, when the WBA (Super) middleweight champion Daniel Geale signed to fight Anthony Mundine in a rematch, the WBA stripped Geale of the title and named Golovkin the sole WBA champion at middleweight.

The fight was halted when Rosado's corner threw in the towel to save Rosado, who was battered and bleeding heavily from his nose and left eye. At the time of the stoppage, Golovkin led on the judges' scorecards 60-54, 60-54, and 59-55. According to CompuBox Stats, Golovkin landed 208 of 492 punches thrown (42%) and Rosado landed only 76 of his 345 thrown (22%). did golovkin hit hard?","output":"Yes, Gennady Golovkin, also known as \\"GGG,\\" is known for his tremendous punching power and ability to deliver hard-hitting punches. This was evident in his fight against Grzegorz Proksa, where Golovkin dominated and scored a fifth-round TKO victory. After the fight, Proksa praised Golovkin's power by stating, \\"The guy hits like a hammer. I tried everything, but it did not work. You have to give him credit, because he had a good handle on the situation, and it was an honor to meet him in the ring.\\" The statistics from CompuBox further support this, as it showed that Golovkin landed 101 of 301 punches thrown (34%), significantly higher than Proksa's 38 of 217 thrown (18%). Additionally, the fight against Gabriel Rosado further demonstrated Golovkin's hard-hitting capabilities, which ultimately led to Rosado's corner throwing in the towel to protect their fighter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He wears a tan overcoat that stores various items such as an M1911A1 Colt Commander automatic pistol. He carries a cheap Instamatic camera (new in 1965) with him and photographs everything he sees, particularly the things that would ordinarily be unimportant to a journalist. Caution is, in fact, on a series of missions. First, he searches for the missing agent Henri Dickson (Akim Tamiroff); second, he is to capture or kill the creator of Alphaville, Professor von Braun (Howard Vernon); lastly, he aims to destroy Alphaville and its dictatorial computer, Alpha 60. Alpha 60 is a sentient computer system created by von Braun which is in complete control of all of Alphaville. Alpha 60 has outlawed free thought and individualist concepts like love, poetry, and emotion in the city, replacing them with contradictory concepts or eliminating them altogether. One of Alpha 60's dictates is that \\"people should not ask 'why', but only say 'because'.\\" People who show signs of emotion (weeping at the death of a wife, or smiling) are presumed to be acting illogically, and are gathered up, interrogated, and executed. In an image reminiscent of George Orwell's concept of Newspeak, there is a dictionary in every hotel room that is continuously updated when words that are deemed to evoke emotion become banned.

Q: In my early 20s, I was a one-on-one aide for a couple of teenagers with cerebral palsy. With the first one, I was hired by and worked for the family. I picked the teen up from school every day and took care of him until he was in bed for the night. When he passed away, I took a job with the local school district. My client at the school had spastic quadriplegia. He could talk and was actually very smart, but he had no control over his arms or legs. He couldn’t walk. He was never going to walk. The law requires that special education students be put in the least restrictive classroom environment possible. Since this kid was smart and could communicate well, and wasn’t a discipline problem, he had all regular classes. His only accommodation was a one-on-one aide (me), and he was allowed to be late to classes without consequence because we sometimes had to stop in a special room, get him out of his chair, and stretch his legs a little. Basically ten minutes of physical therapy, two or three times per day. Anyway, since this kid was legally required to take all the classes a normal student his age would take, he had to take Physical Education (gym). And, legally, his aide (me) had to accommodate his participation in every class as much as possible, including gym. Most gym classes began with the students doing laps around the track, then participating in a team sport. He couldn’t do the team sport, but, according to the lawyers involved, he should participate in the “laps around the track” part of gym. So I had to push this kid in a wheelchair around the track for about 15 minutes each day, until the other kids were all done and off doing the next activity. Then he and I were able to leave gym class and go do some physical therapy in his own little room just for that. Because, you know… lawyers and rules. According to the above context, answer the following question. When did the author work as an aide to someone with spastic quadriplegia? Select from the following.

Answer the following question: You are considering whether to buy a product. You look at the reviews. Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product? Review title: Pointless Product review: DO NOT BUY FOR RESTAURANT!!!I ordered this and set it aside because I didn't need it right away. A week or two later I started using it, and within a few minutes it just started giving ridiculous and random readouts. Biggest waste of money I've ever had. Plus, it ended up in about 50 worth of lost product because we were unable to get accurate temperatures. Answer:","output":"Step 1: Read and analyze the review The reviewer is expressing strong dissatisfaction with the product and states that it is a waste of money due to inaccurate readings. The reviewer also mentions that they experienced a loss of about 50 in their restaurant because of this issue. Step 2: Consider the context and relevance The product may be some kind of temperature measuring device or thermometer, possibly used in a restaurant for food safety purposes. As the review states, it is not suitable for use in a restaurant. Step 3: Evaluate how the review affects the decision to buy Given the strong negative sentiment expressed in the review, it would decrease the chances of buying the product. The reviewer is clearly warning others not to buy the product, which can impact the overall perception of the product's quality and performance. Step 4: Determine the potential risk of purchasing the product The risk of purchasing the product is higher, considering the reviewer shared their experience of losing 50 worth of products due to inaccurate readings. If the product is being used in a restaurant, such inaccuracies in readings could lead to a larger loss. Conclusion: The chances of buying the product would decrease as a result of this review, primarily due to the strong negative sentiments and concerns about the product's effectiveness and potential loss related to its use."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A year and a half after deploying National Guard troops to counter illegal immigration on the Southwest border, the Department of Homeland Security and Pentagon told Congress Tuesday they are cutting the number of troops and changing their mission. The drawdown, which the department characterized as a \\"transition,\\" will begin in January and should be completed by March. Several lawmakers told CNN the number of National Guard troops on the border will be cut from 1,200 with responsibilities mainly on the ground to 300 who will support the border mission in the air. The Department of Homeland Security said the change is possible because of a jump in the number of Border Patrol officers in the region, an increase in technology and a drop in apprehensions at the border. But several lawmakers criticized the move, saying conditions on the Southwest border merit more troops, not fewer. A deployment of 1,200 troops was \\"not enough to begin with, although they are doing as good a job as they can,\\" Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, told CNN. Poe said the United States has \\"operational control\\" of only 44 percent of the Southwestern border. \\"That's not success,\\" Poe said. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, agreed. \\"If the Obama administration's goal is border security, their actions undermine their objective,\\" he said in a written statement. \\"We should keep guardsmen on the ground until the Border Patrol can gain operational control of the majority of the U.S.-Mexico border.\\" But Rep. Silvestre Reyes, D-Texas, supported the drawdown. \\"While I appreciate the service of our National Guard forces, requiring them to engage in border law enforcement activity is not cost effective,\\" he said in a statement. The Homeland Security Department said that in the fiscal year ending October 1, Border Patrol apprehensions of illegal immigrants -- a key indicator of the amount of illegal immigration -- decreased to 340,252, down 53 percent since fiscal year 2008. Since 2004, the size of the Border Patrol has doubled to 21,444. In a news release announcing the change, the Department of Homeland Security and the Pentagon did not cite exactly how many troops would be pulled from the border, but said the \\"new strategic approach\\" will increase border security. That approach includes \\"adding a number of new multi-purpose aerial assets\\" equipped with the \\"latest surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities.\\" In addition, the National Guard will provide helicopters and planes to the Border Patrol, \\"allowing for faster response capabilities,\\" the news release said. \\"I did not understand or get the impression they are going to add any equipment; they're going to use what they have,\\" said Poe, who was briefed on the changes. The Defense Department budget for the border would drop by half, from 120 million to 60 million, congressional staffers said they were told. Specifics about the ramped-up aerial surveillance are still being worked out, the staffers said. Poe said he plans to fight the change. \\"I'll ask the president to reconsider and then try to figure a way, bipartisan, to show that this is not a wise move,\\" he said. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"The Department of Homeland Security and Pentagon announced a reduction in National Guard troops deployed for countering illegal immigration on the Southwest border. The number of troops will decrease from 1,200 to 300, transitioning from ground-focused operations to supporting the border mission in the air.

This decision is attributed to the increased number of Border Patrol officers and technology, as well as a drop in apprehensions at the border. However, lawmakers like Reps.

The ecologist moved from Aspen, where there was no air pollution, to Seattle which experienced a lot of air pollution. He started studying the weather there as well.  Hint: One result of air pollution is acid rain. Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust. A:","output":"Aspen did not have rain that can kill aquatic life. The ecologist moved from Aspen, where there was no air pollution, to Seattle which experienced a lot of air pollution. Since air pollution is a major cause of acid rain, it can be inferred that Aspen did not have the type of rain that could harm aquatic life due to the absence of air pollution. Whereas, Seattle experienced a greater risk of acid rain as it had significant air pollution from sources such as coal-fired power plants and motor vehicle exhaust, which release sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides into the air, both contributing to the formation of acid rain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Direct pressure on the Taliban had proved unsuccessful. As one NSC staff note put it, \\"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on  Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,\\" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan.\\" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India. The State Department felt that he should not visit India without also visiting Pakistan. The Secret Service and the CIA, however, warned in the strongest terms that visiting Pakistan would risk the President's life. Counterterrorism officials also argued that Pakistan had not done enough to merit a presidential visit. But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South Asia. His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U.S. president had been there since 1969. At his meeting with Musharraf and others, President Clinton concentrated on tensions between Pakistan and India and the dangers of nuclear proliferation, but also discussed  Bin Laden.

Movie plot title: Sesame Street presents Follow That Bird Movie plot: The members of the Feathered Friends' Board of Birds (consisting of the Madame Chairbird, a sparrow, a turkey, a puffin, a robin, and an owl) discuss their situation about Big Bird and hope that they can find a bird family to put him with. The group's social worker Miss Finch (performed by Cheryl Wagner and voiced by Sally Kellerman) is sent to Sesame Street to find Big Bird a worthy bird family and bring him to the selected family. After leaving Sesame Street, New York City, New York, Miss Finch brings Big Bird to the fictional town of Oceanview, Illinois to live with a family of dodos. The dodos all think very poorly of non birds, even saying he should have a bird as a best friend instead of Mr. Snuffleupagus (who is currently watching over Big Bird's nest). This causes him much distress. When Big Bird runs away from his new home and ends up on the news, Miss Finch tells Kermit the Frog that she will reclaim him. His friends back on Sesame Street also see the news and band together to find him before Miss Finch does. In a Volkswagen Beetle is the group of Gordon, Olivia, Linda, and Cookie Monster. Count von Count departs in his Countmobile. Ernie and Bert go out to search in an airplane. Grover flies as Super Grover (later falling into the Volkswagen). Maria, much to her dismay, has to ride with Oscar the Grouch, Telly Monster, and Homer Honker in Oscar's Sloppy Jalopy. They all head out across America in search for their beloved Big Bird. Oscar, however, decides to go his own route wanting to have some fun, which greatly annoys Maria and Telly. Big Bird has various adventures in his attempt to get home. First, he hitches a ride with a turkey truck driver (Waylon Jennings) who tells him not to give up trying to get to his goal. He then meets two kids named Ruthie and Floyd (Alyson Court and Benjamin Barrett) at a farm and stays with them for a while. He ends up having to leave because of Miss Finch's arrival.

To do this, subtract 279 from both sides of the equation. 50*l + 279 - 279 = -371 - 279 50*l = -650 Step 3: Solve for l. Now that we have isolated the term with the variable (50*l), we can solve for l by dividing both sides of the equation by 50.
