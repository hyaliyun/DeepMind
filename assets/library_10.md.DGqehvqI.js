Iran The centuries-long geopolitical and ideological rivalry between Safavid Iran and the neighboring Ottoman Empire, led to numerous Ottoman–Persian Wars. The Safavid Era peaked in the reign of Abbas the Great, 1587–1629, surpassing their Ottoman arch rivals in strength, and making the empire a leading hub in Western Eurasia for the sciences and arts. The Safavid Era saw the start of mass integration from Caucasian populations into new layers of the society of Iran, as well as mass resettlement of them within the heartlands of Iran, playing a pivotal role in the history of Iran for centuries onwards. Following a gradual decline in the late 1600s and early 1700s, which was caused by the internal conflicts, the continuous wars with the Ottomans, and the foreign interference (most notably the Russian interference), the Safavid rule was ended by the Pashtun rebels who besieged Isfahan and defeated Soltan Hosein in 1722. Q: Safavid Iran peaked during whose reign?","output":"Safavid Iran peaked during the reign of Abbas the Great.

It is the most common form of artificial lighting and is essential to modern society, providing interior lighting for buildings and exterior light for evening and nighttime activities. In technical usage, a replaceable component that produces light from electricity is called a lamp. Compact lamps are commonly called light bulbs; for example, the incandescent light bulb. Lamps usually have a base made of ceramic, metal, glass or plastic, which secures the lamp in the socket of a light fixture. The electrical connection to the socket may be made with a screw-thread base, two metal pins, two metal caps or a bayonet cap.  - Night skiing is the sport of skiing or snowboarding after sundown, offered at many ski resorts and mountains. There are usually electric lights  including LED lamps  along the piste which allow for better visibility. It typically begins after a resort's skiing-day ends (sunset), and ends between 8:00 and 10:30 p.m.  - Sunset or sundown, is the daily disappearance of the Sun below the horizon as a result of Earth's rotation. The Sun will set exactly due west at the equator on the the spring and fall equinoxes, each of which occurs only once a year.  The time of sunset is defined in astronomy as the moment when the trailing edge of the Sun's disk disappears below the horizon. Near to the horizon, atmospheric refraction causes the ray path of light from the Sun to be distorted to such an extent that geometrically the Sun's disk is already about one diameter below the horizon when sunset is observed.   - Skiing is a mode of transport, recreational activity and competitive winter sport in which the participant uses skis to glide on snow. Many types of competitive skiing events are recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the International Ski Federation (FIS).  - A ski resort is a resort developed for skiing, snowboarding, and other winter sports. In Europe, most ski resorts are towns or villages in or adjacent to a ski area  a mountainous area with pistes, ski trails and a ski lift system. In North America, it is more common for ski areas to exist well away from towns, so ski resorts usually are destination resorts, often purpose-built and self-contained, where skiing is the main activity.  - Montana is a state in the Western region of the United States. The state's name is derived from the Spanish word (mountain). Montana has several nicknames, although none official, including \\"Big Sky Country\\" and \\"The Treasure State\\", and slogans that include \\"Land of the Shining Mountains\\" and more recently \\"The Last Best Place\\". Montana has a border with three Canadian provinces: British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan, the only state to do so. It also borders North Dakota and South Dakota to the east, Wyoming to the south, and Idaho to the west and southwest. Montana is ranked 4th in size, but 44th in population and 48th in population density of the 50 United States. The western third of Montana contains numerous mountain ranges.

Once the southern portion of the Dakota Territory, South Dakota became a state on November 2, 1889, simultaneously with North Dakota. Pierre is the state capital and Sioux Falls, with a population of about 171,000, is South Dakota's largest city.  - Nebraska is a state that lies in both the Great Plains and the Midwestern United States. The state is bordered by South Dakota to the north, Iowa to the east and Missouri to the southeast, both across the Missouri River, Kansas to the south, Colorado to the southwest and Wyoming to the west. Its area is just over 77,220 sq mi (200,000 km) with almost 1.9 million people. Its state capital is Lincoln. Its largest city is Omaha, which is on the Missouri River.  - Utah (or ) is a state in the western United States. It became the 45th state admitted to the U.S. on January 4, 1896. Utah is the 13th-largest by area, 31st-most-populous, and 10th-least-densely populated of the 50 United States. Utah has a population of more than 3 million (Census estimate for July 1, 2016), approximately 80% of whom live along the Wasatch Front, centering on the state capital Salt Lake City. Utah is bordered by Colorado to the east, Wyoming to the northeast, Idaho to the north, Arizona to the south, and Nevada to the west.

Thus, the answer would be [b]. it is not possible to tell. To further explain this answer, let's break down the premise and hypothesis. Premise: Genetic engineering can do crazy things. This statement suggests that genetic engineering has the potential to create significant and unexpected outcomes. However, it does not indicate whether these outcomes are positive, negative, or context-dependent. It simply highlights the remarkable and perhaps surprising capabilities of genetic engineering. Hypothesis: Genetic engineering is useful for taking on new problems. This statement posits that genetic engineering holds potential utility in addressing novel issues or challenges. It implies that the application of genetic engineering might present practical benefits and solutions for new problems that individuals, societies, or the environment may encounter. Now, let's examine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise underscores the surprising and remarkable capabilities of genetic engineering, while the hypothesis claims that genetic engineering is useful for tackling new problems. While it might be logical to deduce that genetic engineering's capabilities (no matter how \\"crazy\\" they may be) can be harnessed to address new problems, the link between the two statements is not strong enough to draw a definitive conclusion. In essence, just because genetic engineering can lead to unexpected and extraordinary outcomes does not inherently mean that these outcomes are useful or advantageous in addressing new problems. Although there may be a correlation between \\"crazy things\\" and solving new problems, there is not enough evidence or information in the premise to definitively prove the hypothesis. Therefore, the answer is [b]. it is not possible to tell. Further investigation and evidence would be needed to establish a more concrete connection between the premise and the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Few singles view dating apps with affection As couples celebrate Valentine’s Day with roses and romance, the unattached may be furiously scrolling through prospects on their phones, hoping their true love is just a swipe away. But a new report suggests that online daters aren’t satisfied with the apps they trust with their love lives. A report by Boston-area mobile research and consulting firm Applause ranked the most popular dating apps by consumer satisfaction. They fell far short of perfect, scoring an average of 44 points out of 100 — a full 26 points lower than the average of all other apps in the app stores. The research focused on apps with at least 2,000 user reviews in the Apple and Android app stores. Those 97 apps were then ranked based on how many stars they had and what users said in their text reviews. Ben Gray, author of the study, said that above all, users want dating apps to be fast and easy to use. And indeed, the top-ranked app, JustSayHi, with instructions right in the name, scored the highest, an 88, for its user-friendly interface and low-stakes terms of engagement. JustSayHi lets users meet people in chat rooms. It also makes it easy to start video chatting with potential love interests — a feature Gray predicts will become a fixture on the app-based dating scene. Rounding out the top five were Surge, Mingle, Jaumo, and OKCupid. Tinder, the industry leader in the hearts and minds of many, dropped a full 10 percentage points since last year. Just 40 percent of users reported positive experiences using the app. Two apps from the Boston area made the list. Moco, a free app by Boston-based JNJ Mobile that emphasizes flirty, casual chats, scored 55 percent in customer satisfaction. Cambridge’s own gay dating app Jack’d, developed by Online Buddies, scored 45 percent. What in store for the future of matchmaker apps? Gray cites the success of Happn — the brainchild of a former Tinder executive — that is geared towards women and alerts users when a match is nearby. He sees apps continuing to court women with features that prevent people from sending messages unless the match is mutual. With so many apps to choose from, and more than 400,000 singles in the Cambridge-Boston area, fear not this Valentine’s Day. A date is just a swipe away.

The metallic element, Lutetium, is named after the Latin name of which European capital city?","output":"Lutetium, a metallic element with the symbol Lu and atomic number 71, is named after the Latin name of Paris, the capital city of France. The origin of its name can be traced back to the ancient name of Paris, which was called Lutetia (sometimes spelled Lutetia Parisiorum) during the Roman era. Lutetium was discovered in the early 20th century, independently by Austrian mineralogist Carl Auer von Welsbach and French scientist Georges Urbain in 1907. At the time, both researchers were working on mineral samples obtained from the rare earth ores, specifically ytterbia. While analyzing the composition of these ores, they discovered the presence of a new metal. Recognizing that this metallic element had not been identified before, they sought to name it. Urbain, who was the first to publish his work on the new element, proposed the name lutecium, derived from the Latin name Lutetia. This was to honor the city in which he conducted his research and made this significant discovery. Later, the name was officially changed to lutetium, following the guidelines set for other elements in the periodic table. Paris, or Lutetia in Latin, has a rich history that dates back to the Roman Empire when it was an important city under Roman rule. Over time, Paris grew to become a significant center for commerce, science, arts, and culture, and it remains a prominent global city today.

Also, it is NOT ergonomic by any means. You have to really bunch your fingers and hold it at the top so your fingers don't slip and to depress the button - or you need long fingers. The button HURTS! Hard grooved plastic and a flat edge - that digs into your finger every time you press it. And since it's not aerosol, you need to press it a lot. It does not spray for me evenly at all - even on first use, I got maybe 2 full sprays, then it went right to a thin stream of oil, with intermittent spray. And when it does spray, it gets everywhere!

Went to Claim Jumpers for a lunch today with a friend around noon, and even with the busy lunch rush we were seated right away and waited on within 1 min of being in our seat. We both knew what we wanted to order, my friend had the Cobb Salad, which by the way looked delish and I had the Chinese Chicken Salad which I just can't get enough of!! Omg so good!! Love the sweet & spicy peanut dressing!  We were in and out within a hour.  I want to say the service was great, but I'm a little turned off by the service today, it was like we were the only table and our waitress was back at our table every 5 minutes,,,our conversation keep getting cut off, and when we only have 45 mins, I need all the talk time I can get right? LOL  I know it's odd to complain about too much service, but I was about to ask her to just back off a bit.  My friend would just give her the eye roll. Poor girl.  Yes I would go back again and hopefully the waitress would be bothering someone else and not me haha.","output":"The sentiment of this review can be described as mixed, with both positive and negative aspects mentioned by the reviewer. On the positive side, the reviewer appreciates the quick seating and service during the busy lunch rush, as well as the delicious food choices they made, such as the Chinese Chicken Salad with sweet & spicy peanut dressing. The fact that they were able to complete their lunch within an hour also adds to the positive experience. However, there is a significant negative aspect in the review as well, which is related to the service provided by the waitress. The reviewer felt that the constant interruption of their conversation due to the overly attentive waitress was a drawback, even going as far as suggesting that they were inclined to ask her to back off a little. This factor led to a somewhat uncomfortable atmosphere, as evidenced by the eye-rolls from the reviewer's friend. Despite the negatives, the reviewer still states that they would return to the restaurant, hoping for a less intrusive service experience next time. Overall, this review showcases both the appealing qualities of the restaurant and a notable issue with the service that the reviewer believes can be improved upon."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Options: - panic - resting - stress - excitement - working  The answer is \\"excitement\\" because Answer:","output":"The answer is \\"excitement\\" because it is a common emotion when individuals embark on a new journey, such as beginning a new job. This transition signifies personal growth, development, and an opportunity to learn and contribute to the success of the organization. There are several reasons why excitement is the most likely feeling in this scenario, as opposed to the other given options: 1. New experiences: Starting a new job often comes with new experiences, such as meeting new colleagues, getting acquainted with the company's organizational culture, and learning new skills. These experiences can be exciting, as they provide a fresh outlook, broaden perspectives, and allow for personal and professional growth. 2. Sense of accomplishment: Finally securing a job after a period of job hunting or graduating from college can be incredibly rewarding. This sense of accomplishment fuels the excitement, giving the individual the motivation and enthusiasm to take on the challenges of the new role. 3. Opportunities for success: A new job represents an opportunity to showcase one's abilities and make a lasting impact in the company. The chance to prove oneself, earn respect and acknowledgment from peers, and climb the career ladder can contribute to a sense of excitement. 4. Personal and professional development: Every new job brings with it the possibility of personal and professional evolution. Taking on new responsibilities, acquiring expertise in a specific field, and facing a variety of challenges can be exciting, as they contribute to an individual's overall growth and boost their self-esteem. 5. Increased financial stability: A new job can lead to a better financial situation, giving individuals the means to provide for themselves and their families, plan for the future, and achieve their personal aspirations. The prospect of achieving financial goals and experiencing a better quality of life likely contributes to the excitement surrounding starting a new job. While the other emotions listed (panic, resting, stress, and working) may be present to some extent during the initial phases of a new job, excitement stands out as the most prominent feeling. Panic and stress are typically short-lived and can be alleviated as the individual gains confidence and familiarity with their new role. Resting may not adequately describe the feeling one experiences when beginning a new job, as it implies a sense of calmness and inactivity. Working, on the other hand, is an action rather than a feeling and does not directly express the emotions associated with starting a new job. Ultimately, excitement encompasses various aspects of personal and professional development, anticipation of success, and the promise of a brighter future, making it the most suitable answer to describe the emotions experienced when starting a new job."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: how many games to get premier league medal?","output":"The traditional rule to earn a Premier League medal is that a player must make at least five appearances for the winning team during the league season. An appearance does not require the player to play 90 minutes of the match; coming onto the field as a substitute or being substituted off still counts as an appearance. However, it's important to note that there are exceptions to this rule. Over time, the rule has been slightly relaxed to recognize the contributions of players who might not have reached the five appearances, mainly due to injuries or being the backup goalkeepers, but have still been an integral part of the squad. The league does reserve the right to award additional medals to such players at its discretion. This also applies to the staff as well, the coaching folks, the medical staff and others who made significant contributions to the success of the team. The Premier League winners are presented with 40 medals in total to give out. The distribution of these medals is usually decided by the club's management. In case a club needs more than the prescribed 40 medals, the club must order and pay for any extras. Similar rules apply for other titles such as the runner-up medals. Moreover, it's also important to highlight that these rules are specific to the Premier League, which is the top tier of English football. Other leagues around the world, such as Spain's La Liga, Italy's Serie A or Germany's Bundesliga, might have differing requirements for their title-winning medal distribution. However, even though the Premier League specifies the five game rule, the true value of the medal often comes from being part of a title-winning team, no matter how many games a player partook in. Many players and football enthusiasts would argue that it's the collective effort, team spirit, and overall contribution that really counts, more than just the number of appearances. From rigorous training sessions to friendly matches, from moral support to tactical insights, every single effort made by each member of the team plays a crucial role in a club's journey to the top of the Premier League. Hence, this prestigious medal symbolizes much more than just those appearances, it encapsulates countless hours of hard work, sweat, strategies, and the unrivaled joy of victory."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Write the next sentence in this paragraph: How to minimize seasonal allergy symptoms  Know the pollen count.  If you suffer from seasonal allergies, you should always check your local newspaper, tv station, radio station, or the internet for pollen forecasts. These resources will also tell you about current pollen levels.","output":"Avoiding outdoor activities on high-pollen days. If the pollen forecast promises a high concentration of airborne irritants, it might be preferable to postpone outdoor activities or, if this is not feasible, to reduce the time spent outside to a minimum. Generally, pollen levels are at their highest in the morning and at dusk, so rearranging your schedule to dodge those peak periods can be an effective way to minimize exposure. Wearing sunglasses when outside can also help guard the eyes from irritation due to airborne pollen.  Moreover, certain lifestyle adjustments can be conducive to alleviating allergy symptoms. For instance, keeping the windows closed at home and in the car, especially on those high-pollen days, could be beneficial. Instead, use air-conditioning units which have anti-pollen filters.  Also, after spending time outside, ensure to shower and change clothing with clean ones to rid your skin and hair of accumulated pollen. Wash your bedding frequently, as pollen particles can collect on your sheets and pillowcases. Similarly, if you have pets, they might also carry pollen into the house, so consider giving them regular baths during the pollen season.  Diet also plays a significant role in managing allergy symptoms. Consumption of certain fruits, vegetables, and other high antioxidant foods help to minimize the inflammation caused by the allergic reactions. An increased intake of fluids could also be useful since this can help soothe a sore or scratchy throat and alleviate congestion.  Ultimately, effective medication and treatment options for seasonal allergy could add another layer of safeguard. Over-the-counter medications are readily available and can reduce uncomfortable symptoms such as a runny nose, itchy eyes, and sneezing. Antihistamine tablets, nasal sprays, and eye drop solutions commonly serve this purpose. However, for severe cases or persistent symptoms, consulting a healthcare professional is highly recommended. They may prescribe stronger medications or suggest an allergy shot regimen which can significantly help to build immunity against specific types of pollen.  Lastly, remember to maintain a clean environment as much as possible. Regular cleaning of the living spaces can considerably reduce the amount of indoor allergens. Specialized air purifiers that can remove allergens from your home environment may also be a worthy investment.  By diligently and consciously employing these strategies, you can proactively safeguard yourself against the aggravating symptoms of seasonal allergies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The morning settled my nerves a bit more and before long the train pulled into the station. Boston had a slower feel, much slower than New York. The air was cool and peppered with moisture. I knew I was close to the ocean. Vision blurry, I wobbled out of the train depot and thought about the fact that I had never really done anything crazy in my life. The colors meant something here. Green was the color of plants but it was also the color of money. Plants were good but money was bad. I didn't know what green meant. Blue and red were clear though. Blue was the color of ocean and sky, both good things. Red was the color of Mars and it was manly but mars meant aliens and aliens were bad so red was bad. This is how I navigated. I followed the colors. I was lost in a daze of exhaustion and moved my feet slowly. They were dead and raw with pain and blisters, and I shuffled out into the city. My eyes darted from color to color, sign to sign, connection to connection. I floated like a ghost and thought about crying. There were few people out so I found a relative ease in that but my mind still jumped around reckless. I needed to find Kim. I saw a silent pay phone with a dangling phonebook and headed towards it until I remembered that phone books don't normally list cell phones. Kim wasn't the type of girl to list herself in the phonebook either. I had no leads but I knew I could go to a library and maybe find out her number if she had listed it on Facebook, so I kept walking. Stopping at benches, I would rest until I could muster more energy. Who is the author looking for?  A. Kim  B. a ghost  C. an alien  D. not enough information","output":"The author is looking for Kim, which is mentioned several times in the passage. The author's primary goal is to find Kim and even considers going to a library to obtain her number from Facebook. Thus, the answer is A. Kim. The author provides a detailed description of their surroundings as they arrive in Boston. The city is described as gray, with dirt red buildings that contrast against the backdrop. Upon disembarking from the train, the author feels the cool, moist air, indicating their proximity to the ocean. The pace of life in this location is slower than in New York City. The author also talks about how they navigate by colors, attributing various meanings to each hue. For example, green represents conflicting ideas as it is related to both plants, which are considered good, and money, which is considered bad. Blue represents the ocean and sky, while red is associated with Mars, manliness, and negative implications like aliens. Throughout this passage, the author describes their physical and emotional state. They're exhausted, with painful, blistered feet causing them to shuffle slowly through the city. The lack of people on the streets seems to comfort them, but their mind continues to race, jumping from idea to idea. Despite the challenging situation, the author's focus remains on finding Kim. They even consider utilizing a pay phone and phonebook to locate her, but ultimately decide this method would be unsuccessful. While Kim's connection to the author is not explained, it is clear that finding her is the most crucial objective for the protagonist. In conclusion, the author is looking for Kim, showcasing their determination and will to navigate the unfamiliar city while battling through exhaustion and pain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: A Rift in Worldviews Is Exposed as Clinton Faults Obama on Policy For the 19 months since Hillary Rodham Clinton departed as President Obama’s secretary of state, she and Mr. Obama, and their staffs, have labored to preserve a veneer of unity over how they worked together and how they view the world. On Sunday, the veneer shattered — the victim of Mrs. Clinton’s remarkably blunt interview with Jeffrey Goldberg, a writer for The Atlantic, in which she criticized not just Mr. Obama’s refusal to aid the rebels in Syria, but his shorthand description of his entire foreign policy. “Great nations need organizing principles, and ‘Don’t do stupid stuff’ is not an organizing principle,” Mrs. Clinton said, referring to the line that Mr. Obama has used with aides and reporters to describe his reluctance to inject the United States into messy foreign conflicts. Mrs. Clinton said she assumed the line was more a “political message” for a war-weary American public than his worldview — an interpretation that makes her words even more stinging, since “Don’t do stupid stuff” was in fact the animating principle for the foreign-policy blueprint that Mr. Obama laid out in a speech at West Point in May. That Mrs. Clinton is more hawkish than Mr. Obama is no surprise to anyone who watched a Democratic primary debate in 2008. Her policy differences with the president during his first term were well documented, though they were less about underlying strategy than tactics. She favored supplying arms to moderate Syrian rebels, leaving behind a somewhat larger residual military force in Iraq and waiting longer before withdrawing American support for President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt during the historic protests in Cairo. What has changed is her readiness to raise those differences to the surface and put them in the context of a different worldview. Even her memoir “Hard Choices,” which she was promoting in her interview with Mr. Goldberg, soft-pedaled the gaps and painted a portrait of her and Mr. Obama in lock step in rebuilding America’s tattered image abroad. Now, though, Mrs. Clinton is suggesting that she and the president hold different views on how best to project American power: His view is cautious, inward-looking, suffused with a sense of limits, while hers is muscular, optimistic, unabashedly old-fashioned. “You know, when you’re down on yourself, and when you are hunkering down and pulling back, you’re not going to make any better decisions than when you were aggressively, belligerently putting yourself forward,” Mrs. Clinton said to Mr. Goldberg. “One issue is that we don’t even tell our own story very well these days.” Much of the interview’s resonance is in its timing, coming two days after Mr. Obama authorized airstrikes against Sunni militants in Iraq. Mrs. Clinton’s aides say this was an unfortunate coincidence; the session was scheduled before anyone knew about military action, which has “amplified a statement about militants” she has made before. Still, when Mrs. Clinton says that “the failure to help build up a credible fighting force” against President Bashar al-Assad in Syria “left a big vacuum, which the jihadists have now filled,” the suggestion is that Mr. Obama’s refusal to arm the rebels might end up being a singular misjudgment. But at the time of the Obama administration’s internal debate over that decision, several officials said, Mrs. Clinton’s advocacy was far less thunderous: The United States had tried every diplomatic gambit with Syria, she said, and nothing else had worked, so why not try funneling weapons to the moderate rebels. As Mrs. Clinton stakes out her own foreign policy positions in advance of a possible campaign for the White House, it is only natural that some of her statements will not be entirely in sync with her record as secretary of state, when she served at the pleasure of the president. At the end of her tenure, for example, Mrs. Clinton wrote a memo to Mr. Obama recommending that the United States lift its half-century-old trade embargo against Cuba. It was not a position that she seriously advocated while at the State Department, officials said. In the interview with The Atlantic, Mrs. Clinton said she had always been in the camp of those who believed that Iran had no right to enrich uranium. Yet in December 2010, she was one of the first American officials to acknowledge publicly, in an interview with the BBC, that Iran could emerge from a nuclear deal with the right to enrich. Mrs. Clinton also lined up solidly with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel — a starkly different position from the first term, when she often had to play the heavy during peace negotiations, chiding Mr. Netanyahu for refusing to curb settlement construction. Even on the Gaza conflict, about which the State Department harshly criticized Israel recently for the number of civilian deaths, she said, “I’m not sure it’s possible to parcel out blame” because of the “fog of war.” Mrs. Clinton is not the only former cabinet member to part company with Mr. Obama on foreign policy. Robert M. Gates, the former defense secretary, wrote a memoir laced with criticism of the administration’s approach to Afghanistan and other crises. In an interview with The New York Times in April, Leon E. Panetta, the former defense secretary and C.I.A. director, said of Mr. Obama, “The concern is, the president defining what America’s role in the world is in the 21st century hasn’t happened.” But Mrs. Clinton is not just any former cabinet member. Because of their long history and Mrs. Clinton’s political future, advisers to her and Mr. Obama have worked especially hard to head off any discord. Her staff gave parts of her memoir to Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, for review before publication. Their interlocking staffs have furthered that effort. Jake Sullivan, Mrs. Clinton’s top policy aide at the State Department, went to work as national security adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a post that allowed him to convey the White House’s sensitivities to her aides. Mrs. Clinton hired Tommy Vietor, a longtime Obama aide who was the spokesman for the National Security Council, to help with the rollout of her book. Mrs. Clinton’s aides worried that some in the news media might use the book to try to drive a wedge between her and the president; Mr. Vietor’s job was to push back on that effort. During the Crimea crisis, the White House chief of staff, Denis McDonough, invited in Clinton aides, including Philippe Reines and Huma Abedin, for consultations. Mrs. Clinton also checks in by email with Mr. Rhodes on issues like Myanmar, in which both have a special interest. And she lunches periodically with Mr. Obama. How well those ties will weather Mrs. Clinton’s latest remarks remains to be seen.

Hypothesis: The man is practicing gymnastics. .Multi-select problem: Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true? Pick from: (I). yes; (II). it is not possible to tell; (III). no;","output":"(II). it is not possible to tell. Explanation: While the premise describes a singular event of a man in a room doing a handstand during the day, it does not necessarily imply that the man is practicing gymnastics. The hypothesis that the man is practicing gymnastics is a reasonable assumption but not a definitive conclusion. There are various factors to consider that might lead to different conclusions: 1. Motivation: The man could be doing the handstand for reasons other than practicing gymnastics. For example, he might be performing a yoga pose, trying a new form of exercise, or attempting a personal challenge. 2. Context: The surrounding environment could provide more clues about the man's intentions. If the room contains gymnastics equipment or if the man is dressed in athletic wear, it might strengthen the link between the handstand and a gymnastics practice. However, if the room looks like a typical office or living space, it becomes less likely that the man is practicing gymnastics specifically. 3. Skill level: The man's proficiency in performing the handstand could serve as another indicator. If he demonstrates excellent form and control, it could support the hypothesis that he is a gymnast. On the other hand, if the man struggles to maintain balance or shows poor technique, it might suggest that he is not a gymnast or is a beginner in the discipline. 4. Repetitiveness: If the man performs multiple handstands or other gymnastic-related skills, such as walkovers or cartwheels, it could further reinforce the hypothesis that he is practicing gymnastics. However, if the man only performs one handstand and does not engage in any other related activities, it becomes harder to determine if he is specifically practicing gymnastics or merely trying a single move for fun or other reasons. In conclusion, although the hypothesis that the man is practicing gymnastics is plausible, it cannot be definitively concluded based on the provided premise alone. More information and context would be required to confirm or refute the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

De Benneville \\"Bert\\" Bell (February 25, 1895 - October 11, 1959) was the National Football League (NFL) commissioner from 1945 until his death in 1959. As commissioner, he introduced competitive parity into the NFL to improve the league's commercial viability and promote its popularity, and he helped make the NFL the most financially sound sports enterprise and preeminent sports attraction in the United States (US). He was posthumously inducted into the charter class of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Bell played football at the University of Pennsylvania, where as quarterback, he led his team to an appearance in the 1917 Rose Bowl. By early 1933, Bell's opinion on the NFL had changed, and he wanted to become an owner of a team based in Philadelphia. After being advised by the NFL that a prerequisite to a franchise being rendered in Philadelphia was that the Pennsylvania Blue Laws would have to be mollified, he was the force majeure in lobbying to getting the laws deprecated. He borrowed funds from Frances Upton, partnered with Wray, and he procured the rights to a franchise in Philadelphia which he christened as the Philadelphia Eagles.  After the inaugural 1933 Philadelphia Eagles season, Bell married Upton at St. Madeleine Sophie Roman Catholic Church in Philadelphia. Days later, his suggestion to bestow the winner of the NFL championship game with the Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy was affirmed. In 1934, the Eagles finished with a 4-7 record, The Eagles' inability to seriously challenge other teams made it difficult to sell tickets, and his failure to sign a talented college prospect led him to adduce that the only way to bring stability to the league was to institute a draft to ensure the weakest teams had an advantage in signing the preeminent players. In 1935, his proposal for a draft was accepted, and in February 1936, the first draft kicked off, at which he acted as Master of Ceremonies. Later that month, his first child, Bert Jr., was born.  In the Eagles' first three years, the partners exhausted 85,000 (presently, 1,499,017), and at a public auction, Bell became sole owner of the Eagles with a bid of 4,500 (presently, 79,360). Austerity measures forced him to supplant Wray as head coach of the Eagles, wherein Bell led the Eagles to a 1-11 finish, their worst record ever. In December, an application for a franchise in Los Angeles was obstructed by Bell and Pittsburgh Steelers owner Rooney as they deemed it too far of a distance to travel for games. During the Eagles' 2-8-1 1937 season, his second child, John \\"Upton\\", was born. In the Eagles' first profitable season, 1938, they posted a 5-6 record. The Eagles finished 1-9-1 in 1939 and 1-10 in 1940. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did he do anything else interesting?","output":"Yes, Bert Bell did many interesting things. For example, he \\"introduced competitive parity into the NFL to improve the league's commercial viability and promote its popularity.\\" He also helped \\"make the NFL the most financially sound sports enterprise and preeminent sports attraction in the United States.\\" Additionally, he played a big role in lobbying to change the Pennsylvania Blue Laws, which allowed him to create the Philadelphia Eagles team.

Make sure to tell your healthcare provider about any allergies you have, and about any medications you are currently taking. If you do not have diabetes, Victoza may still help you lose weight if you have metabolic damage or leptin resistance. However, since the FDA has only approved the use of Victoza for treating people with Type 2 diabetes, your insurance (in the U.S.) may not cover it if you do not have Type 2 diabetes. The Victoza pen contains 18 mg of medication. Depending on your case, your healthcare provider may prescribe you a 0.6, 1.2, or 1.8 mg dosage. However, your healthcare provider may start you on an even lower dosage to see how your body reacts to the medication first. Victoza lowers your blood sugar by slowing the food that is leaving your stomach, preventing your liver from producing too much sugar, and by producing more insulin when your blood sugar is high. It is an injectable, non-insulin medication that should be taken once a day. It can be taken with other diabetes medications, including insulin. Possible side effects include decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, indigestion, and constipation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Information:  - A personal computer (PC) is a multi-purpose electronic computer whose size, capabilities, and price make it feasible for individual use. PCs are intended to be operated directly by a person using a graphical user interface such as Windows. The versatility of a personal computer is greatly enhanced by the use of peripheral devices such as a keyboard, monitor, printer, mouse, speakers, and an external hard drive.  - Microsoft Office is an office suite of applications, servers, and services developed by Microsoft. It was first announced by Bill Gates on 1 August 1988, at COMDEX in Las Vegas. Initially a marketing term for a bundled set of applications, the first version of Office contained Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint. Over the years, Office applications have grown substantially closer with shared features such as a common spell checker, OLE data integration and Visual Basic for Applications scripting language. Microsoft also positions Office as a development platform for line-of-business software under the Office Business Applications brand. On 10 July 2012, Softpedia reported that Office is used by over a billion people worldwide.  - Redmond is a city in King County, Washington, United States, located east of Seattle, within the Seattle metropolitan area. The population is 60,560 in 2016, an increase from the 2010 census, up from 45,256 in 2000 census. Redmond is commonly recognized as the home of Microsoft and Nintendo of America. With an annual bike race on city streets and the state's only velodrome, Redmond is also known as the \\"Bicycle Capital of the Northwest\\".  - An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. All computer programs, excluding firmware, require an operating system to function.  - Money laundering is the process of transforming the profits of crime and corruption into ostensibly 'legitimate' assets. In a number of legal and regulatory systems, however, the term money laundering has become conflated with other forms of financial and business crime, and is sometimes used more generally to include misuse of the financial system (involving things such as securities, digital currencies, credit cards, and traditional currency), including terrorism financing and evasion of international sanctions. Most anti-money laundering laws openly conflate money laundering (which is concerned with \\"source\\" of funds) with terrorism financing (which is concerned with \\"destination\\" of funds) when regulating the financial system.  - Internet Explorer (formerly Microsoft Internet Explorer and Windows Internet Explorer, commonly abbreviated IE or MSIE) is a discontinued series of graphical web browsers developed by Microsoft and included as part of the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, starting in 1995. It was first released as part of the add-on package Plus! for Windows 95 that year. Later versions were available as free downloads, or in service packs, and included in the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) service releases of Windows 95 and later versions of Windows.  - Robert Alan Soloway is the founder of the so - called \`\` Strategic Partnership Against Microsoft Illegal Spam , '' or SPAMIS , but is said to be one of the Internet 's biggest spammers through his company , Newport Internet Marketing ( NIM ) . He was arrested on May 30 , 2007 , after a grand jury indicted him on charges of identity theft , money laundering , and mail , wire , and e-mail fraud . He was nicknamed the \`\` Spam King '' by prosecutors .  - In common usage, theft is the taking of another person's property or services without that person's permission or consent with the intent to deprive the rightful owner of it. The word is also used as an informal shorthand term for some crimes against property, such as burglary, embezzlement, larceny, looting, robbery, shoplifting, library theft, and fraud (\\"i.e.\\", obtaining money under false pretenses). In some jurisdictions, theft is considered to be synonymous with larceny; in others, theft has replaced larceny. Someone who carries out an act of or makes a career of theft is known as a thief. The act of theft is also known by other terms such as stealing, thieving, and filching.  - Consumer electronics or home electronics are electronic or digital equipment intended for everyday use, typically in private homes. Consumer electronics include devices used for entertainment (flatscreen TVs, DVD players, DVD movies, iPods, video games, remote control cars, etc.), communications (telephones, cell phones, e-mail-capable laptops, etc.), and home-office activities (e.g., desktop computers, printers, paper shredders, etc.). In British English, they are often called brown goods by producers and sellers, to distinguish them from \\"white goods\\" such as washing machines and refrigerators. In the 2010s, this distinction is not always present in large big box consumer electronics stores, such as Best Buy, which sell both entertainment, communications, and home office devices and kitchen appliances such as refrigerators. Consumer electronics stores differ from professional audio stores in that the former sells consumer-grade electronics for private use, whereas the latter sells professional-grade electronics designed for use by audio engineers and audio technicians.  - Identity theft is the deliberate use of someone else's identity, usually as a method to gain a financial advantage or obtain credit and other benefits in the other person's name, and perhaps to the other person's disadvantage or loss. The person whose identity has been assumed may suffer adverse consequences if they are held responsible for the perpetrator's actions. Identity theft occurs when someone uses another's personally identifying information, like their name, identifying number, or credit card number, without their permission, to commit fraud or other crimes. The term \\"identity theft\\" was coined in 1964.  - A video game console is an electronic, digital or computer device that outputs a video signal or visual image to display a video game that one or more people can play.  - A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is a software application for retrieving, presenting and traversing information resources on the World Wide Web. An \\"information resource\\" is identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI/URL) that may be a web page, image, video or other piece of content. Hyperlinks present in resources enable users easily to navigate their browsers to related resources.  - Microsoft Windows (or simply Windows) is a metafamily of graphical operating systems developed, marketed, and sold by Microsoft. It consists of several families of operating systems, each of which cater to a certain sector of the computing industry with the OS typically associated with IBM PC compatible architecture. Active Windows families include Windows NT, Windows Embedded and Windows Phone; these may encompass subfamilies, e.g. Windows Embedded Compact (Windows CE) or Windows Server. Defunct Windows families include Windows 9x; Windows 10 Mobile is an active product, unrelated to the defunct family Windows Mobile.  - A court is a tribunal, often as a government institution, with the authority to adjudicate legal disputes between parties and carry out the administration of justice in civil, criminal, and administrative matters in accordance with the rule of law. In both common law and civil law legal systems, courts are the central means for dispute resolution, and it is generally understood that all persons have an ability to bring their claims before a court. Similarly, the rights of those accused of a crime include the right to present a defense before a court.  - Microsoft Corporation (commonly referred to as Microsoft or MS) is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington, that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports and sells computer software, consumer electronics and personal computers and services. Its best known software products are the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, Microsoft Office office suite, and Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface tablet lineup. As of 2016, it was the world's largest software maker by revenue, and one of the world's most valuable companies.  - In law, fraud is deliberate deception to secure unfair or unlawful gain, or to deprive a victim of a legal right. Fraud itself can be a civil wrong (i.e., a fraud victim may sue the fraud perpetrator to avoid the fraud and/or recover monetary compensation), a criminal wrong (i.e., a fraud perpetrator may be prosecuted and imprisoned by governmental authorities) or it may cause no loss of money, property or legal right but still be an element of another civil or criminal wrong. The purpose of fraud may be monetary gain or other benefits, such as obtaining a driver's license or qualifying for a mortgage by way of false statements.  - Terrorism financing refers to activities that provides financing or financial support to individual terrorists or terrorist groups. A government that maintains a list of terrorist organizations normally will also pass laws to prevent money laundering being used to finance those organizations.  - Grand jury is a legal body empowered to conduct official proceedings and investigate potential criminal conduct, and determine whether criminal charges should be brought. A grand jury may compel the production of documents and compel sworn testimony of witnesses to appear before it. Grand jury is separate from the courts, which do not preside over its functioning.  - Law is a system of rules that are created and enforced through social or governmental institutions to regulate behavior. State-enforced laws can be made by a collective legislature or by a single legislator, resulting in statutes, by the executive through decrees and regulations, or established by judges through precedent, normally in common law jurisdictions. Private individuals can create legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people.    What entity does 'robert soloway' has the relation 'occupation' with?

A Texas woman claims she was forced to give birth alone in jail during a horrific night in solitary confinement nearly two years ago, and that her baby died because of it, according to a federal lawsuit filed this week. Nicole Guerrero alleges in legal documents that \\"Wichita County denied (her) access to reasonable medical care ... ignored her obvious signs of labor and constant requests for medical assistance, failed to conduct a physical examination ... when she began to display obvious signs of labor, left (her) unattended in a solitary cell while she was obviously in labor, failed to transport (her) to the hospital for safe delivery, which ultimately caused (her) to deliver her baby alone in the solitary cell, and resulted in (her) suffering severe and likely permanent, physical and psychological injuries.\\" Wichita County isn't talking about the case. \\"We are prohibited (from talking) about pending litigation in Texas because we are representing the county in this case,\\" said Wichita County District Attorney Maureen Shelton. The lawsuit, which was filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Texas, names as defendants Wichita County, the Sheriff's Office, registered nurse LaDonna Anderson, and Correctional Healthcare Management, Inc., Anderson's employer. Here's what Guerrero says happened, according to court documents:. She was arrested on drug possession charges on June 2, 2012. After visiting her doctor for an infection on June 11, while still in custody, Guerrero says her doctor told her she was  8½ months pregnant. According to the legal complaint, once Guerrero was returned to jail she experienced severe pain and cramping. She said she was checked out by the nurse on duty, identified in court documents as Anderson, late on the night of June 11. Anderson determined at that time Guerrero was not in labor, according to the legal documents. The complaint then detailed a night spent in solitary confinement, during which Guerrero claims she tried to get medical attention throughout the night and into the early morning hours as her pain worsened, but that she was ignored by Anderson and the guards on duty. Finally, Guerrero said, around 5 a.m. on June 12, a detention officer walking by her cell helped her deliver the baby. The court filing said the baby was not breathing when it was born and that the umbilical cord was wrapped around its neck. Guerrero says in court papers that no CPR was performed on the baby and that it was later pronounced dead at a local hospital. Guerrero alleged she was still kept in solitary confinement, without medical help, after the baby was taken away. Guerrero's lawsuit accuses Anderson and Correctional Healthcare Management of medical malpractice. Her attorney Rick Bunch said Wichita County and Sheriff David Duke violated her due process rights under the 14th Amendment by depriving her of access to reasonable medical care, according to CNN affiliate KFDX.

Answer the following question: It’s always interesting to read back on why people do things, especially people who end up making a career or a fortune out of the seemingly benign choices they make. Thelma Schoonmaker, the film editor whom my previous post was about was one of those people; she got into editing after seeing an ad in the New York Times. I’m in no way suggesting I’m going to make a fortune, nor that I’m a Thelma Schoonmaker in the making, but I certainly do make a lot of benign choices. Art blogging, for me, was one of those benign choices. I made the decision to start an art blog very randomly, so randomly I’m not even sure where the idea came from. At the time I had been studying a bachelor of psychology for about two years and found myself interested in the subject, but underwhelmed with the lack of creative ideas and media I was being exposed to. I’d always been interested in art and most creative mediums, often recording music or taking photographs on the side. But the pages and pages of white and black scientific journal articles must have got to me, because I found myself yearning for splashes of colour, moving imagery, challenging concepts and undefinable ideas. The next thing I knew I had started an art blog aptly titled: Artistic Expansion and I began spending hours a day searching through the internet for content, often finding my best pieces in the most random places, often not even defined intentionally as ‘art’. Over the last two years I must have blogged hundreds of multi-coloured, multi-textured and multi-layered images, accumulated over 2000 followers and consumed more art than I ever had in my entire life. I find it interesting not because of it’s success, but because before I started my art blog, I really had no idea how much I did or could love art and once I had made my art blog I  couldn’t imagine how I ever functioned without it.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who remained a prominent painter of nudes but made conscious efforts to try to reflect moral lessons in his work  William Etty was born in 1787 in York, the son of a miller and baker. He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year indenture he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours\\", with the aim of emulating the Old Masters and becoming a history painter. Etty gained acceptance to the Royal Academy Schools in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. The supposed prurient reaction of the lower classes to his nude paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as...

He may also have to change his signature.      If Lew, the current White House chief of staff, is confirmed by the Senate, his John Hancock will grace the lower right-hand side of each bill in your wallet. The only problem? Lew's signature can best be described as a series of circles and squiggles that bear no resemblance to the actual characters in his name.      Current Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner told Marketplace last year that he had to change his signature from a loopy version to something more legible when he submitted his signature to the Bureau of Printing and Engraving to print on currency notes. \\"I had to write something where people could read my name,\\" he said in the interview.      In a press conference Thursday, Lew acknowledged their shared signature struggle.      \\"It was only yesterday that I discovered that we both share a common challenge with penmanship,\\" he said.      Related: Obama to pick Jack Lew as Treasury Secretary      Obama said on Thursday that he hadn't seen Lew's signature until the day before. When he did, he said he considered rescinding his offer to appoint him.      \\"Jack assures me that he is going to work to make at least one letter legible in order not to debase our currency, should he be confirmed,\\" Obama said.      Sheila Low, a handwriting expert and president of the American Handwriting Analysis Foundation, said Lew's current signature reminded her of a steamroller.      \\"From his signature, it seems to me that he'll put forth his ideas, and he'll keep going until he gets done what he wants to do.\\"      The process of transferring the new secretary's signature can take three months. The bureau must first receive the signatures of the new secretary and the new treasurer. The bureau then creates a series of bills with new serial numbers and suffix letters. A new plate also has to be designed before they can begin printing the bills.      The signatures of the Treasury secretaries may seem like small potatoes, but they are required to be changed on currency notes in order to make the bills legal tender. ||||| This is Jack Lew's signature:                  Seriously. That is really, honestly his signature. It has been confirmed. And if he's treasury secretary, that signature might begin appearing on legal currency. The Daily Intelligencer mocked up what that would look like:      Obviously, that would turn American currency into the best money ever. Unfortunately there's always the chance that Lew could ruin everything by making his signature less, well, loopy. That's what the fun destroyer Timothy Geithner did when he became treasury secretary. ||||| Obama's America.      Jack Lew, President Obama’s reported pick to replace outgoing Treasury secretary Tim Geithner, is known as a no-nonsense backroom negotiator with wonkish tendencies, who is admired on the left and grumbled about on the right.      A lesser-known but extremely pertinent fact about Lew is that he has the world’s worst signature. And pretty soon, that signature could be on every single one of your dollar bills.      If Lew is confirmed as Treasury secretary, his signature will occupy the lower-right-hand spot on U.S. paper currency. And that signature, which was widely mocked when it surfaced on a September 2011 memorandum, is legitimately crazy.      Here are some things it reminds us of:      – a Slinky that has lost its spring      – one of those Crazy Straws you get at Six Flags      – Sally Brown’s hair in Peanuts      – a slip of paper in Office Max that people use to try out new pens      Clearly, Lew will need to upgrade his penmanship, à la Geithner, before he even thinks about touching the dollar bill. Minting a trillion-dollar coin seems absolutely reasonable, as fiscal policy plans go, compared to having this childish loop-de-loop plastered all over the legal tender of the United States. ||||| UPDATED — 2:39 p.m. ET:      At Jack Lew’s nomination for Treasury secretary, President Barack Obama said that he had never noticed his chief of staff’s loopy signature before yesterday.      At the end of Thursday’s announcement, the president joked, “When this was highlighted yesterday in the press, I considered rescinding my offer to appoint him.”      The president told the country that Lew will follow Sec. Tim Geithner’s lead in changing his signature before signing bills. “Jack assures me that he is going to work to make at least one letter legible in order not to deface our currency should he be confirmed as secretary of the Treasury.”      On Wednesday, NBC News confirmed that current White House Chief of Staff Jack Lew had been nominated to succeed Timothy Geithner as Treasury secretary.      NBC also confirmed that Jack Lew’s signature is a series of looped scribbles that resembles the markings left on a notepad when you can’t seem to get your pen working.      As Treasury secretary, Lew’s signature will be printed on all bills minted during his tenure.      It turns out Sec. Geithner had a similarly illegible signature before being appointed. He however changed it prior to placing his John Hancock on all American currency minted under his watch.      In an interview with Marketplace’s Kai Ryssdal, Geithner said, “I had to write something where people could read my name.” Adding, “I didn’t try for elegance. I tried for clarity.”      In the same interview Geithner explained that he was in India for third grade, when he took handwriting class.      We are not sure what Jack Lew’s excuse is for having what Andrea Mitchell said “might be the world’s worst signature.”      It remains to be seen whether Lew will follow Geithner’s lead in reworking his signature, but imagine the signature in its current state on every crisp new dollar bill in America. ||||| You've probably got a dollar or two in your pocket with Timothy Geithner's signature on it. But the Treasury Secretary's John Hancock wasn't always, shall we say, legible. He had to change his autograph from this to this when his signature was added to the storied list of those featured on our nation's currency.      Marketplace host Kai Ryssdal squeezed this curious detail out of Geithner during his exclusive interview Thursday afternoon in San Francisco, which airs Friday on Marketplace.      Kai Ryssdal: I gotta ask you about your handwriting. Is it true that this used to be your signature and you changed it into that chicken scratch? Timothy Geithner: Yes it is true. Ryssdal: And why would you do that? Geithner: You mean from this to that ? Ryssdal: Yeah. Geithner: You mean you like this one ? I thought you liked the one on the one dollar bill . Ryssdal: No, that one is horrible. I like that one . Geithner: Well, I think on the dollar bill I had to write something where people could read my name. That’s the rationale. Ryssdal: Really? Geithner: I didn’t try for elegance. I tried for clarity. Ryssdal: 'Cause you know Mrs. Quiggly, my 1st grade teacher, she would have given me the big F on that one. Geithner: Well, I took handwriting in the third grade in New Delhi, India, so I probably did not get the best instruction on handwriting.      Some might say both versions are better than that of some of the past signatures featured on U.S. Currency, as seen here.      Learn more about Geithner and listen to our full interview with the Treasury Secretary here. |||||Summary:","output":"The new Treasury Secretary nominee, Jack Lew, has a very unique and unreadable signature which has caused quite a discussion among people. If he becomes the Treasury Secretary, his signature will appear on the printed money.

Write a title for this article: Editor's note: Donna Brazile, a CNN contributor and a Democratic strategist, is vice chairwoman for voter registration and participation at the Democratic National Committee. She is a nationally syndicated columnist, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and author of \\"Cooking With Grease: Stirring the Pots in America.\\" She was manager for the Gore-Lieberman presidential campaign in 2000. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN) -- Ah, Cliven Bundy -- poster boy for the anti-government, rugged-individualist crowd. The Marlboro Man for the conservative fantasy world. Cliven Bundy is so bizarre he leaves late night comedians spluttering. (Just check out one of Jon Stewart's riffs.) His comments about race were so embarrassing that Sean Hannity, who had called Bundy \\"a friend and frequent guest of the show,\\" had to do a \\"protest too much\\" denouncement. Yes, Hannity called Bundy's words \\"beyond repugnant\\" -- but only after first promoting him as a patriot par excellence. Republican office-holders, such as Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nevada, and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, who had been cheerleading Bundy and his rabble also had to distance themselves, many of them fumbling with their rhetorical pom-poms in the process. Here's the basic background: Bundy is a wealthy Nevada rancher who believes he has \\"beneficial use\\" claim to grazing lands owned by the federal government. Ownership of the land is not a matter of dispute. Bundy has been in and out of protracted court battles for decades, and he's lost every time. In 1993, Bundy stopped paying the grazing fees for using federal Bureau of Land Management land. His fees accumulated to 1 million. Finally, after two courts ruled in the bureau's favor, it moved to seize Bundy's cattle, planning to sell them at auction to pay for the 20 years' worth of grazing fees. On April 5, the bureau brought in armed federal agents and began removing Bundy's cattle. Bundy's son Dave was arrested for refusing to leave. That night, Bundy sent a message: \\"They have my cattle and now they have one of my boys. Range War begins tomorrow.\\" Visions of the Wild West, anyone? Frontier justice? Or not. Bundy's supporters rallied around him, traveling from out of state. That's when the bizarre started. Richard Mack, a former Arizona sheriff, said, \\"We're actually strategizing to put all the women up at the front. If they are going to start shooting, it's going to be women that are going to be televised all across the world getting shot by these rogue federal officers.\\" How's that for a jaw-dropper? The standoff lasted a week, until the bureau announced on April 12 that it would return the seized cattle because of its \\"grave concern about the safety of employees and members of the public.\\" Well, not all of them. You see, Bundy based his claim that he did not have to pay the grazing fees because -- well, here are his words: \\"I believe this is a sovereign state of Nevada. And I abide by all Nevada state laws. But I don't recognize the United States government as even existing.\\" You see, Bundy is violating the Constitution of Nevada, and therefore the state's laws. Article 1, Section 2 of that state's constitution reads, in part: \\"...the Paramount Allegiance of every citizen is due to the Federal ...and no power exists in the people of this or any other State of the Federal Union to dissolve their connection therewith...\\" Conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer told Fox News: \\"This is a man who said that he doesn't recognize the authority of the United States of America. That makes him a patriot? I love this country, I love the Constitution, and it is the Constitution that established a government that all of us have to recognize. And for him to reject it was the beginning of all of this. And now what he said today is just the end of this.\\" That's the point. We can disagree about policies and politics, and even whether baseball or football is \\"America's sport.\\" Hopefully we'll again get to a place in our civic discourse where we can be civil and compromise for the common good, to move toward that \\"more perfect Union\\" the Constitution mentions. But denying the very existence of the United States? Still, that's not what had other Republicans and conservative pontificators going, \\"oops.\\" It was Bundy's obscene, racist remarks: \\"And because they [Blacks] were basically on government subsidy, so now what do they do? They abort their young children, they put their young men in jail, because they never learned how to pick cotton. And I've often wondered, are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government subsidy? They didn't get no more freedom. They got less freedom.\\" That's why Republicans are distancing themselves from Bundy. Because Bundy's words destroy their argument that we shouldn't talk about race. Bundy's remarks, following so closely on the Supreme Court's Schuette decision, refute Chief Justice John Roberts' misguided insistence that \\"racism will end when we stop helping minorities\\" and prove Justice Sonia Sotomayor right when she says that the act of ignoring pervasive structural racism is an abdication of judicial responsibility. Thanks to the federal government and men and women of valor who fought for those words written in our Constitution, we can have this debate. And it is that same Constitution that gives even a racist idiot like Bundy freedom to spew his lunacy while riding his horse and waving his American flag, even if some Republicans now pretend they've never heard of the guy.

After rescuing the EU officials and destroying the cyborgs, ESWAT return to Olympus, where Briareos is confined to hospital until he recovers, while Deunan continues ESWAT work. When Deunan's commanding officer Lance introduces her to her new partner, Tereus, she is shocked as her partner resembles Briareos' human form.Deunan confronts Lance for an explanation, and is given the tour of the new Bioroid production facility. During the tour, Hitomi, a bioroid that Deunan befriended during those events, is mentioned to now be a minister of political affairs. Here it is shown that Tereus is actually a Bioroid; a prototype for a whole new production line of Bioroids to be soldiers without negative emotions to impact their judgment in fighting. As his physical and mental strength was found to be most desirable in ESWAT, Briareos' DNA was used mostly in Tereus' design.

Article: About nine million people like rock climbing in America. Millions more take part in the activity around the world. Some do it just for fun. Others compete. Climbing takes strength, control and good balance. Climbers have to pull themselves straight up the face of very high rocks or walls. So they have to be strong enough to carry their own weight. And climbers sometimes have to hold onto rocks by only their fingers or toes. There are several kinds of rock climbing. Traditional rock climbing is done outside. Climbers wear ropes and tie equipment to the rocks as they climb many hundreds of meters up. They also connect their ropes to the equipment. If a climber slips, a rope can stop him from falling. Sport climbing is similar. However, in it the protective equipment is placed in the rock all the time. There is also indoor climbing. Rock walls made of wood have places for the climber's hands and feet. Ice climbing is exactly as it sounds. People climb glaciers or frozen waterfalls instead of rocks. They use special equipment for the ice. And then there is bouldering-climbing rocks   between three and seven meters high. It is quicker and stronger climbing. Many climbers like bouldering because they can use less equipment. Climbers often need only special shoes and chalk  . All climbers use chalk to keep their hands dry. Most rocks have cracks and holes and parts that stick out. Climbers use these for foot-holds and handholds. Climbers use their legs to climb. They try not to pull themselves up with their hands or arms. Arms and hands are for position and balance. People almost always climb in groups of two or more. Climbing alone is very dangerous. Expert rock climbers say only the very best in the sport should do it. Question: Which of the following is TRUE about rock climbing? Answer: Select from the following. (A). Climbers use their hands or arms to climb.. (B). Climbers use no special equipment for ice climbing.. (C). Climbers do rock climbing in groups.. (D).

Although it connects to the pharynx, it is not the tube that joins the mouth to the digestive and respiratory tracts. 2. Esophagus: The esophagus is a muscular tube connecting the pharynx to the stomach. It is responsible for transporting food and liquids from the mouth to the stomach through successive muscular contractions called peristalsis. While the esophagus is part of the digestive tract pathway, it is not the actual tube that joins the mouth to both the respiratory and digestive tracts. 3. Fallopian tube: The fallopian tubes (uterine tubes or oviducts) are part of the female reproductive system. They connect the ovaries to the uterus and play a crucial role in the transport of ova (eggs) from the ovaries to the uterus, as well as providing a site for fertilization. The fallopian tubes have no direct connection to the mouth or respiratory and digestive tracts. In summary, the pharynx is the tube that joins the mouth with the digestive and respiratory tracts, as per the information provided in the paragraph you shared."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence 1: 'That's the fellow,'   Sentence 2: He looks like the man.   Possible answers: a. yes b. it is not possible to tell c. no Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"In order to evaluate if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, it is essential to understand the concept of entailment. Entailment refers to a relationship between two sentences where the truth of one sentence guarantees the truth of the other sentence. Essentially, if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence must also be true. Now let us analyze the sentences provided: Sentence 1: 'That's the fellow,' This sentence suggests that the speaker is identifying or recognizing someone as \\"the fellow\\" in question. The speaker seems certain in their identification. Sentence 2: He looks like the man. This sentence implies that the person being discussed bears a resemblance to the man. This statement includes some level of uncertainty, as the speaker is commenting on the similarity rather than confirming the identity. Given these two sentences, let's consider the possible answers: a. yes This option suggests that the second sentence is definitely entailed by the first sentence. However, as we discussed above, the first sentence demonstrates certainty, while the second sentence implies uncertainty. As a result, the truth of the first sentence does not guarantee the truth of the second sentence. b. it is not possible to tell This option suggests that there is not enough information to determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. Given the difference in certainty levels between the two sentences, it seems that this option is the most appropriate. While the two sentences do address the same topic, they do so with varying levels of confidence, which prevents a definitive determination of entailment. c. no This option suggests that the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. As mentioned earlier, the first sentence expresses certainty while the second sentence contains uncertainty. However, as the two sentences do address the same subject, it could be argued that they are related, making this option less feasible than option b. Therefore, based on the analysis, it can be concluded that the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. The appropriate answer is: b. it is not possible to tell"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Please answer the following question: Information:  - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas.  - Bouvet Island (Norwegian: Bouvetøya, previously spelled Bouvet-øya) is an uninhabited subantarctic high island and dependency of Norway located in the South Atlantic Ocean at . It lies at the southern end of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and is the most remote island in the world, approximately south-southwest of the coast of South Africa and approximately north of the Princess Astrid Coast of Queen Maud Land, Antarctica.  - The Scandinavian Peninsula (;  \\"Skandinavsky poluostrov\\") is a peninsula in Northern Europe, which generally comprises the mainland of Sweden, the mainland of Norway (with the exception of a small coastal area bordering Russia), the northwestern area of Finland, as well as a narrow area in the west of the Pechengsky District of Russia.  - Greenland  is an autonomous constituent country within the Danish Realm between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island.  - Nynorsk, literally New Norwegian or New Norse, is one of the two written standards of the Norwegian language, the other being Bokmål. From 1885, when the parliament declared them official and equal, until new voting in 1929, their names were Landsmål and Riksmål. The Landsmål language standard was constructed by the Norwegian linguist Ivar Aasen during the mid-19th century, to provide a Norwegian-based alternative to Danish, which was commonly written, and to some extent spoken, in Norway at the time. The official standard of Nynorsk has since been significantly altered. A minor purist fraction of the Nynorsk populace has stayed firm with the Aasen norm, which is known as Høgnorsk (analogous to High German).  - Vest-Agder \\"(West Agder)\\" is a county in Norway, bordering Rogaland to the west and Aust-Agder to the east. In 2002 there were 157,851 inhabitants, which is 3.4% of the total population in Norway. Its area is . The county administration, and largest city is Kristiansand.  - Rogaland is a county in Western Norway, bordering Hordaland, Telemark, Aust-Agder, and Vest-Agder counties. Rogaland is the center of the Norwegian petroleum industry. In 2016, Rogaland had an unemployment rate of 4.9%, one of the highest in Norway. In 2015, Rogaland had a fertility rate of 1.78 children per woman, which is the highest in the country.  - The Republic of Iceland, \\"Lýðveldið Ísland\\" in Icelandic, is a Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean. It has a population of and an area of , making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe. The capital and largest city is Reykjavík. Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate.  - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.  - Jan Mayen is a volcanic island in the Arctic Ocean and a part of Norway. It is long (southwest-northeast) and in area, partly covered by glaciers (an area of around the Beerenberg volcano). It has two parts: larger northeast Nord-Jan and smaller Sør-Jan, linked by a wide isthmus. It lies northeast of Iceland (495 km (305 mi) NE of Kolbeinsey), east of central Greenland and west of the North Cape, Norway. The island is mountainous, the highest summit being the Beerenberg volcano in the north. The isthmus is the location of the two largest lakes of the island, Sørlaguna (South Lagoon), and Nordlaguna (North Lagoon). A third lake is called Ullerenglaguna (Ullereng Lagoon). Jan Mayen was formed by the Jan Mayen hotspot.  - Haugaland or Haugalandet is a traditional district situated on the western coast of Norway. Haugaland is one of the 15 traditional districts located within the Vestlandet region.  - Western Norway is the region along the Atlantic coast of southern Norway. It consists of the counties Rogaland, Hordaland, Sogn og Fjordane, and Møre og Romsdal. The region has a population of approximately 1.3 million people. The largest city is Bergen and the second-largest is Stavanger. Historically the regions of Agder, Vest-Telemark, Hallingdal, Valdres and northern parts of Gudbrandsdal have been included in Western Norway.  - Peter I Island is an uninhabited volcanic island in the Bellingshausen Sea, from Antarctica. It is claimed as a dependency of Norway, and along with Queen Maud Land and Bouvet Island comprises one of the three Norwegian dependent territories in the Antarctic and Subantarctic. Peter I Island is long and , slightly larger than Staten Island. The tallest peak is the ultra and tall Lars Christensen Peak. Nearly all of the island is covered by a glacier and it is surrounded most of the year by pack ice, making it inaccessible almost all year round. There is little life on the island apart from seabirds and seals.  - Kvitsøy is an island municipality in Rogaland county, Norway. At only , it is the smallest municipality in Norway by area. Kvitsøy is located in the traditional district of Ryfylke. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Ydstebøhamn on the island of Kvitsøy. The municipality is an archipelago located at the entrance to the large Boknafjorden. It sits about northwest of the mainland Stavanger peninsula. There are plans for the Rogfast tunnel to eventually connect Kvitsøy to the mainland road network.  - Utsira is one of the smallest municipalities in Norway . The island municipality is located in northwestern Rogaland county , just off the western coast of Norway . Utsira is part of the traditional district of Haugaland . Utsira is the smallest municipality of Norway by population and it is the second smallest municipality by area ( after the nearby island municipality of Kvitsøy ) . The municipality consists of the main island of Utsira as well as several small , uninhabited outlying islands . Utsira is located in the North Sea , about 18 kilometres ( 11 mi ) west of the town of Haugesund . All of the 206 residents ( as of 2015 ) live on the main island of Utsira , where the administrative centre and Utsira Church is located .  - An archipelago, sometimes called an island group or island chain, is a chain, cluster or collection of islands. The word \\"archipelago\\" is derived from the Greek \\"-  arkhi-\\" (\\"chief\\") and \\"  pélagos\\" (\\"sea\\") through the Italian \\"arcipelago\\". In Italian, possibly following a tradition of antiquity, the Archipelago (from medieval Greek \\"*\\" and Latin \\"archipelagus\\") was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and, later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a small number of scattered islands.  - Bohuslän is a Swedish province in Götaland, on the northernmost part of the country's west coast. It is bordered by Dalsland to the northeast, Västergötland to the southeast, the Skagerrak arm of the North Sea to the west, and the county of Østfold, in Norway, to the north.  - Orkney, also known as the Orkney Islands, is an archipelago in the Northern Isles of Scotland, situated off the north coast of Great Britain. Orkney is 16 kilometres (10 mi) north of the coast of Caithness and comprises approximately 70 islands, of which 20 are inhabited. The largest island Mainland is often referred to as \\"the Mainland\\". It has an area of , making it the sixth-largest Scottish island and the tenth-largest island in the British Isles. The largest settlement and administrative centre is Kirkwall.  - Ryfylke is a traditional district in the northeastern part of Rogaland county, Norway. The district is located northeast of the city of Stavanger and east of the city of Haugesund and it encompasses about 60% of the county's area. It includes the mainland located northeast and east of the Boknafjorden and east of the Høgsfjorden. It also includes the islands located on the south side of the Boknafjorden. To the east, Ryfylke borders the districts of Setesdal and Sirdal, to the south is Jæren, and to the west is Haugalandet. Ryfylke is one of the 15 districts in Western Norway.  - A monarchy is a form of government in which a group, usually a family called the dynasty, embodies the country's national identity and one of its members, called the monarch, exercises a role of sovereignty. The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic (crowned republic), to partial and restricted (\\"constitutional\\" monarchy), to completely autocratic (\\"absolute\\" monarchy). Traditionally and in most cases, the monarch's post is inherited and lasts until death or abdication, but there are also elective monarchies where the monarch is elected. Each of these has variations: in some elected monarchies only those of certain pedigrees are, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, and other factors. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose legitimacy is subject to effective election. Finally, there have been cases where the term of a monarch's reign is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance. Thus there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy. Monarchy was the most common form of government until the 19th century, but it is no longer prevalent. Where it exists, it is now usually a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch retains a unique legal and ceremonial role, but exercises limited or no official political power: under the written or unwritten constitution, others have governing authority. Currently, 47 sovereign nations in the world have monarchs acting as heads of state, 19 of which are Commonwealth realms that recognise Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state. All European monarchies are constitutional ones, with the exception of the Vatican City which is an elective monarchy, but sovereigns in the smaller states exercise greater political influence than in the larger. The monarchs of Cambodia, Japan, and Malaysia \\"reign, but do not rule\\" although there is considerable variation in the degree of...  - Rogfast or the Rogaland Fixed Link is a planned sub-sea road tunnel between the municipalities of Randaberg (near the city of Stavanger) and Bokn in Rogaland county, Norway. The project will be a world record with respect to its length and its maximum depth of below sea level. This will be a part of the main European route E39 highway along the west coast of Norway and it will link the cities of Kristiansand  Stavanger  Haugesund  Bergen.  - Queen Maud Land is a c. 2.7 million-square-kilometre (1 million sq mi) region of Antarctica claimed as a dependent territory by Norway. The territory lies between 20° west and 45° east, between the British Antarctic Territory to the west and the Australian Antarctic Territory to the east. On most maps there had been an unclaimed area between Queen Maud Land's borders of 1939 and the South Pole until June 12, 2015 when Norway formally annexed that area. Positioned in East Antarctica, the territory comprises about one-fifth of the total area of Antarctica. The claim is named after the Norwegian queen Maud of Wales (18691938).  - Bokmål (literally \\"book tongue\\") is an official written standard for the Norwegian language, alongside Nynorsk. Bokmål is the preferred written standard of Norwegian for 85% to 90% of the population in Norway, and is most used by people who speak Standard Østnorsk.  - Scandinavia is a historical and cultural region in Northern Europe characterized by a common ethnocultural North Germanic heritage and mutually intelligible North Germanic languages.  - Stavanger is a city and municipality in Norway. The city is the third-largest urban zone and metropolitan area in Norway (through conurbation with neighbouring Sandnes) and the administrative centre of Rogaland county. The municipality is the fourth most populous in Norway. Located on the Stavanger Peninsula in Southwest Norway, Stavanger counts its official founding year as 1125, the year the Stavanger Cathedral was completed. Stavanger's core is to a large degree 18th- and 19th-century wooden houses that are protected and considered part of the city's cultural heritage. This has caused the town centre and inner city to retain a small-town character with an unusually high ratio of detached houses, and has contributed significantly to spreading the city's population growth to outlying parts of Greater Stavanger.  - Härjedalen is a historical province or \\"landskap\\" in the centre of Sweden. It borders the country of Norway as well as the provinces of Dalarna, Hälsingland, Medelpad, and Jämtland. The province originally belonged to Norway, but was ceded to Sweden in the Treaty of Brömsebro, 1645.  - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines.  - Telemark is a county in Norway, bordering Vestfold, Buskerud, Hordaland, Rogaland and Aust-Agder. The county administration is in Skien. Until 1919 the county was known as \\"Bratsberg amt\\".  - The Faroe Islands (Irish: \\"Na Scigirí\\") are an archipelago between the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic approximately halfway between Norway and Iceland, north-northwest of mainland Scotland. The area is approximately with a 2016 population of 49,188. The islands are an autonomous country within the Kingdom of Denmark.  - Shetland , also called the Shetland Islands, is a subarctic archipelago that lies northeast of the island of Great Britain and forms part of Scotland, United Kingdom.  - Antarctica (US English , UK English or ) is Earth's southernmost continent. It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At , it is the fifth-largest continent. For comparison, Antarctica is nearly twice the size of Australia. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages in thickness, which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula.  - Jämtland (Norwegian: \\"Jemtland\\"; Latin: \\"Iemptia\\") or Jamtland is a historical province (\\"landskap\\") in the center of Sweden in northern Europe. It borders to Härjedalen and Medelpad in the south, Ångermanland in the east, Lapland in the north and Trøndelag and Norway in the west. Jämtland covers an area of 34,009 square kilometres, 8.3% of Sweden's total area and is the second largest province in Sweden. It has a population of 112,717, the majority of whom live in \\"Storsjöbygden\\", the area surrounding lake Storsjön. Östersund is Jämtland's only city and is the 24th most populous city in Sweden.  - Ydstebøhamn or Ystabøhamn is the administrative centre of Kvitsøy municipality in Rogaland county, Norway. The village is located on the southern shore of the island of Kvitsøy. The village has a ferry quay which receives regular ferries from the town of Skudeneshavn on the island of Karmøy across the Boknafjorden to the north, and to the village of Mekjarvik in Randaberg municipality across the Kvitsøyfjorden on the mainland to the south. The planned Rogfast undersea tunnel will connect Kvitsøy to the mainland to the north and south as part of the government's goal of providing a ferry-free European route E39 highway along the west coast of Norway.  - Aust-Agder \\"(East Agder)\\" is a county \\"(fylke)\\" in Norway, bordering Telemark, Rogaland, and Vest-Agder.

Moving is one of the main reasons that people have to leave someone they love. If you are in a situation where you have to move away from close friends or family, it can be really difficult. Try to spend a lot of time with your loved ones before you go.   Make your relationships a priority. Schedule plenty of quality time with your friends before the move. Have fun together. You're likely feeling sad, and that's ok. But try to participate in the activities that you enjoy. If you and your best friend have always enjoyed going dancing together, don't stop. Keep your dance dates up until the time you have to leave. Have an honest conversation. Tell your loved one that you are going to miss them. Try saying, \\"Mom, I'm really going to miss you when I leave for college. I just wanted to let you know that.\\" Let your loved ones know that it is important for you to stay connected. Try brainstorming different ways that you can keep in touch. You can even write some actual letters.  Get on a friends and family cell phone plan. You'll be able to text and call as much as you want without worrying about your minutes. Schedule video chat dates. Are you worried you're going to miss impromptu dance parties with your best friend? Just Facetime her whenever your favorite song comes on. Use technology. Stay connected with social media. This is the perfect time to finally convince your grandmother to get a Facebook account. Leaving someone you love can feel scary. This is especially true if you don't know when you will see them again. To avoid this sinking feeling, schedule a visit before you even leave.  Sit down together with your calendars. If you have a group of friends that you are going to miss, invite everyone over for a planning party. Select a couple of dates that work for everyone. You can have fun deciding when you will visit, and when your friends will come check out your new home. If you are leaving for college, check out the campus calendar. Let your parents know when parents weekend is, and invite them to come. Care packages are a great way to feel connected with your loved ones. Set up a system where you send a package one month and your loved one returns the favor the next month. These packages will give you both something to look forward to.  Include items that remind you of fun times you had together. For example, if you loved going to yoga together, send your friend a gift card to your favorite studio. You can also include items that are homemade. Make a batch of your dad's favorite cookies to send to him. Be creative. If you're thinking of fun times you had at the beach, send a little plastic baggy of sand from the shore. Summary:","output":"To maintain connections with loved ones when moving away, follow these steps: 1. Prioritize relationships and schedule quality time with friends and family before the move. 2. Participate in activities you enjoy together, like going dancing or attending events. 3. Have honest conversations about your feelings and express how much you'll miss each other. 4. Brainstorm ways to stay connected after the move, such as writing letters or using social media. 5. Consider joining a friends and family cell phone plan for unlimited texting and calling. 6. Schedule video chat dates to maintain a sense of closeness. 7. Encourage older family members to use social media for staying connected. 8.

Here is a goal: How do I know if my plants need more humidity? Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"To determine if your plants need more humidity, you can follow a series of steps and observations, taking into consideration your specific plant species' requirements, signs of distress, and environmental factors. The following detailed answer outlines the key aspects to consider and provides practical solutions to improve humidity levels when necessary. 1. Research your plant's specific humidity requirements: Each plant species has its own preferred humidity levels. Begin by researching your plant's optimal humidity range, understanding that tropical plants often require higher humidity while arid region plants may require less. Resources such as gardening books, online forums, or local plant experts can provide valuable guidance. 2. Monitor your indoor environment's humidity level: Invest in a hygrometer, an instrument that measures humidity levels in the air. Place it close to your plants so you can monitor the room's average humidity over time. Compare your readings to your plant's optimal humidity range to determine if adjustments are needed. 3. Look for warning signs of low or high humidity: Signs that your plant may need more humidity include:   - Brown leaf tips or edges   - Wilting even if the soil is wet   - Crisping or curling of leaves   - Stunted growth or lack of new growth   - Flower buds falling off prematurely   - Increased pest problems, such as spider mites On the other hand, signs they may be receiving too much humidity include:   - Yellowing leaves   - Mold and mildew growth on the leaves or soil   - Root rot   - Condensation on leaves 4. Identify and address external factors affecting humidity: Room temperature, ventilation, and sunlight exposure can all impact indoor humidity levels. Heating and air conditioning systems can lower humidity, while sunlight and drafts can cause fluctuations. Minimize these effects by positioning plants away from direct heat or cold sources, and by providing consistent sunlight exposure. 5. Implement humidity-increasing strategies when needed: If your plants do indeed require a more humid environment, there are several ways to increase humidity levels:   - Group plants together: By placing plants close together, they create a microclimate with higher humidity levels due to their collective transpiration.   - Use a humidifier: This appliance can add moisture to the air, allowing you to control and maintain precise humidity levels.   - Place a tray of water with pebbles: Placing a tray filled with water and pebbles near or underneath your plants can increase humidity. As the water evaporates, it raises the moisture level in the air around the plants. Make sure your plant pots aren’t submerged in the water.   - Mist your plants regularly: Spraying a fine mist of water on your plant's leaves can provide localized humidity. Be cautious with this method, as over-misting can lead to issues such as mold growth or pests.   - Use a humidity dome or enclosure: Placing a clear plastic cover or glass cloche over individual plants or a small greenhouse-like enclosure can trap moisture and create a more humid environment, but allow for proper ventilation as well. Regularly monitoring your environment and adjusting humidity levels as required will ensure your plants thrive. Keep in mind that seasonal changes may also necessitate adjustments to your humidity management strategy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Movie plot title: Eden Lake Movie plot: Nursery school teacher Jenny and her boyfriend, Steve, journey to a remote lake in the wooded English countryside. Hiking to the lakeside, they meet Adam, a young boy gathering insects. Relaxing beside the lake, the setting is disrupted by delinquent teenagers and their dog, who have ridden their bicycles to a spot within a few metres of the young couple. After they sleep overnight in their tent, they find their food infested with insects and their car tire damaged by a bottle left behind by the teens. Returning to town for breakfast, Steve spots a house with the bikes he thinks belongs to the kids. When no one answers the door, he walks into the house, narrowly escaping as the surly homeowner returns. Back at the lake, Steve goes scuba diving while Jenny sleeps on the shore. Steve returns to find the bag with their car keys, phone and wallet is missing, soon confirming that their car is gone. Returning to town on foot, they avoid collision with their car, driven recklessly through the woods by the gang's leader, Brett. Finding the gang in the woods after nightfall, Steve demands the return of his belongings, only to be attacked by the knife wielding teens. In the scuffle, Brett's dog is mortally knifed, fuelling Brett's lust for revenge. The couple grab their keys and drive off, but the gang attacks with stones and Steve crashes in the dark forest.

Context: SEOUL — The recent U.S. missile strikes against Syria could increase pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, or reinforce in Pyongyang the need for nuclear deterrence. The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

Most historical accounts state that the island was discovered on 21 May 1502 by the Galician navigator João da Nova sailing at the service of Portugal, and that he named it \\"Santa Helena\\" after Helena of Constantinople. Another theory holds that the island found by da Nova was actually Tristan da Cunha, 2,430 kilometres (1,510 mi) to the south, and that Saint Helena was discovered by some of the ships attached to the squadron of Estêvão da Gama expedition on 30 July 1503 (as reported in the account of clerk Thomé Lopes).

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: The release of TARZAN THE APE MAN, in 1932, caused a sensation. It may be hard to believe, 70 years later, but the film had much of the same kind of impact as THE MATRIX, or THE LORD OF THE RINGS has achieved, at a time when movies and radio were the major sources of entertainment. Tarzan became an instant pop icon, the 'noble savage' that every woman fantasized about, and every man wished he could be. The only person unhappy about the situation was Edgar Rice Burroughs, who, while he'd agreed to MGM's creative liberties, and enjoyed his hefty royalty checks, felt the 'dumbed down' version of his character (with no plans to allow him to 'grow') was unfaithful to his vision (he would start a production company, and soon be making his own 'Tarzan' films). MGM, realizing the value of it's newest 'star', knew the sequel would have to be even more spectacular than the original...and TARZAN AND HIS MATE delivered! The film had an interesting back story; Cedric Gibbons, MGM's legendary Art Director, had gotten a commitment from the studio to direct the sequel, prior to the release of TARZAN THE APE MAN, despite the fact that he'd NEVER directed before (the studio hadn't anticipated the film's impact, and didn't think a novice director would matter much on a 'novelty' film...and they wanted to keep their Oscar-winning department chief happy). Gibbons, a prodigiously talented and imaginative visual artist, loved the freedom of pre-Code Hollywood, and decided to have TARZAN AND HIS MATE 'push the envelope' to the limit...Tarzan and Jane would frolic in a nude swim, and Jane would appear TOPLESS through most of the film. Maureen O'Sullivan said in an interview shortly before her death, in 1998, that while a double was used for the swim, she trusted the studio, and did 'a couple of days' of filming sans top...but it became too much of a headache trying to strategically place plants and fruit to block her nipples, and the idea was abandoned (the film shot those days would be worth a fortune!) She did do a nude silhouette scene in a tent, flashed her breasts at the conclusion of her 'swim', and donned a revised 'jungle' costume that was extremely provocative, very thin, and open at the sides...and the resulting outcry would help 'create' the Hays Office, and the self-censorship that would soon engulf the entire industry. MGM yanked Gibbons from the production (the 'official' reason given was his workload as Art Director), and veteran Jack Conway was listed as the new director, to appease the critics...although James C. McKay actually directed the film, as Conway was busy on 3 other projects, including VIVA VILLA! The film incorporated the best elements of the original (safaris, murderous tribes, Tarzan fighting jungle beasts to the death to save Jane), and actually improved on the storytelling. Harry Holt (Neil Hamilton), from the first film, returns to Africa for ivory from the 'Elephants' Graveyard', and to try to seduce Jane into returning to England, with gifts of silk dresses, underwear, and perfume. He brings with him Martin Arlington (Paul Cavanagh), a crack shot and inveterate womanizer, who sneers at Holt's chivalrous pursuit of Jane, and stalks her as a potential 'conquest', to be had by any means (including killing Tarzan, if and when he can get away with it without being seen). Tarzan barely tolerates the intrusion into his happy life with Jane, and puts his foot down, refusing to allow the hunters into the Graveyard. Arlington finds his opportunity, catching the Ape Man alone, and shoots him, then returns to the camp with a fabricated story of his demise. Now Jane has no reason to remain in the jungle, and she can direct them to the Graveyard, before her long voyage back to England, comforted by the oh-so-sympathetic Arlington. But a savage tribe and hideous torture await the group...can Tarzan, being nursed back to health by his ape 'family', recover in time to save Jane? While stock footage is again used extensively, the racial stereotypes of the 30s are apparent, and the gorillas are obviously actors in ape suits, TARZAN AND HIS MATE achieves a level of sophistication unsurpassed in any other 'Tarzan' film, as well as a sexiness that even Bo Derek's blatantly erotic TARZAN, THE APE MAN couldn't touch. Johnny Weissmuller was in peak condition, physically, Maureen O'Sullivan was never more beautiful, and 'Africa' never looked more romantic, and dangerous. TARZAN AND HIS MATE was a triumph (although it would be drastically edited for many years), and remains THE classic of the series, to this day!","output":"The sentiment of this review is overwhelmingly positive. The author provides a detailed and enthusiastic account of the film's history and praises various aspects of the movie, such as its sophistication, sexiness, and the performances of the lead actors. The reviewer also mentions the impact and sensation that TARZAN THE APE MAN had, which they compare to successful films like THE MATRIX and THE LORD OF THE RINGS. Although the author acknowledges some flaws and dated elements like racial stereotypes and the use of ape suits for gorillas, they ultimately consider TARZAN AND HIS MATE a triumph and the classic of the series."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A banner hangs off his back. \\"Ogami: Suiouryo technique\\" (Child and expertise for rent), it says.

What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process that eventually leads to the formation of minerals within crystals as magma cools involves the generation and upward movement of magma within the Earth's mantle. To better understand this process, let's break it down into several stages: 1. Formation of magma: Magma is formed deep within the Earth's mantle due to partial melting of mantle rocks. This can occur due to various factors such as the Earth's internal heat, the presence of water, or the decrease in pressure as mantle materials move towards Earth's surface. When mantle rocks partially melt, they produce a molten material that consists mainly of silicate minerals and other dissolved volatile substances, including water and gases. 2. Magma ascent: Once the magma is formed, buoyancy forces cause it to rise through the mantle and towards the Earth's crust. Magma is less dense than the solid mantle material, and as a result, it tends to rise through zones of weakness in the mantle and crust, such as areas where tectonic plates are diverging or converging. In addition, the pressure exerted by the mantle continuously pushes the magma towards the Earth's surface. 3. Intrusion or extrusion of magma: Depending on various geological factors and tectonic activity, the magma could either intrude into the Earth's crust or extrude out onto the surface as lava. In both cases, the magma will eventually come in contact with cooler rocks or the atmosphere, triggering the process of cooling and solidifying. 4. Cooling and solidification: As the magma cools, the particles within the magma lose heat and begin to move closer together. As they do, they eventually reach their saturation point, where they can no longer remain in the liquid state. At this point, the minerals within the magma begin to crystallize and form solid structures. The rate at which the magma cools determines the size and nature of the developing crystalline structures – for example, slow cooling results in the formation of larger crystals, while rapid cooling produces smaller crystals or even glassy textures. 5. Formation of minerals: As the crystals grow within the cooling magma, they start to incorporate various elements and compounds available in the magma. These elements and compounds eventually form specific mineral structures that make up the bulk composition of the resulting igneous rock. Some common minerals forming in this process include quartz, feldspar, mica, and amphibole. In summary, the first step of the process that leads to the formation of minerals within crystals as magma cools is the generation of magma within the Earth's mantle due to partial melting of mantle rocks. This sets the stage for the entire sequence of events resulting in the formation of igneous rocks and minerals."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

During his two weeks aboard a ship to the United States, Ahmed Abu Khatallah was questioned by FBI interrogators over his alleged role in the 2012 Benghazi attacks that left four Americans dead. As it turns out, he was interrogated both before and after authorities told him of his Miranda rights -- which give him the right to remain silent to avoid self-incrimination, a U.S. official told CNN. But Abu Khatallah continued providing information to officials after being advised of those rights, the official said. The handling of his case has triggered fallout in Washington. \\"I have serious concerns that conducting a rushed interrogation onboard a ship and then turning Abu Khatallah over to our civilian courts risks losing critical intelligence that could lead us to other terrorists or prevent future attacks,\\" Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, said in a statement Saturday. A U.S. official told CNN that Abu Khatallah denied participation in the Benghazi attacks during his interviews with interrogators -- but provided information on others he said participated and were behind the attacks. It wasn't clear if he provided the information before or after he was advised of his Miranda warning. Shortly after the White House announced the capture earlier this month, Republicans like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio criticized the Obama administration because they believed the alleged terrorist should go through a military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay instead of being tried in a federal court. \\"If they bring him to the United States, they're going to Mirandize this guy, and it would be a mistake for the ages to read this guy his Miranda rights,\\" South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham has said. But the White House has defended its decision, saying that they have successfully tried a number of terrorists domestically and that no new captives have gone to the Guantanamo Bay detention facility in years. Abu Khatallah arrived on U.S. soil Saturday. After two weeks aboard the USS New York sailing from the Mediterranean Sea to the East Coast, Abu Khatallah was flown by helicopter to Washington and was driven to a federal courthouse. There, he pleaded not guilty to one count of providing material support to terrorists. Prosecutors say he is the ringleader of the 2012 attacks on a U.S. diplomatic mission in Libya, which killed U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other Americans. More charges possible. The single count is part of a legal strategy by federal prosecutors, who plan to file additional charges later, according to U.S. officials. The aim is to delay releasing to the public and Abu Khatallah's lawyer the FBI affidavit detailing the evidence the government has against him. An earlier criminal complaint in July 2013 said the FBI believed it had evidence to charge him with murder and firing a weapon at the scene of the Benghazi attacks. Those additional charges, if formally added, could bring the death penalty. In his court appearance, Abu Khatallah, a Libyan national, requested consular assistance from the Libyan government. U.S. authorities were working with Libyan embassy officials in Washington to provide him the assistance. After the hearing, armed guards accompanied Abu Khatallah from the federal courthouse in downtown Washington, a few blocks from the U.S. Capitol and near the White House. He was then moved to the detention center in Alexandria, Virginia, which is across the Potomac River from the capital. Details of the attacks. Authorities say Abu Khatallah is among the senior leaders of Ansar al Sharia, whose members were among several militias that participated in the attacks on U.S. government facilities in Benghazi on September 11-12, 2012. The attacks spawned political controversy in the United States because some Republican lawmakers claim the Obama administration tried to mislead the public about them and should have done more to prevent them. The GOP critics say they plan to make Benghazi an issue for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, under whose watch the attacks occurred, should she decide to run for president. The criminal investigation led by the FBI has been extraordinarily challenging, authorities say, partly because the lack of Libyan government control in the city prevented investigators from visiting the crime scene for weeks. But U.S. officials say they collected surveillance video, phone recordings and witness statements to bring charges against Abu Khatallah and others involved. Abu Khatallah became the face of the militant attack and a top target for the U.S. after he cultivated a celebrity profile in the wake of the attacks, meeting with journalists and granting interviews. He denied to CNN's Arwa Damon that he participated in the attacks. U.S. military commandos captured Abu Khatallah in a nighttime raid June 15-16. U.S. intelligence assets concocted a ruse to lure him to a villa where the Americans surprised him. The commandos, accompanied by several FBI agents, had come ashore by boat and quickly took him back out to sea with them. Abu Khatallah was appointed a public defender, Michele Peterson.

The Russian cavalry was repulsed, but the Russian infantry attack was successful.  The Turks were pushed back into their entrenchments under close range Russian fire.  On the Ottoman left, the Austrian infantry also threw back the defenders.  Defeated on both ends of their line, the Ottomans fled.  The victory was complete by 4:00 p.m.  The allies lacked the resources to pursue the Turks and advanced no farther into Ottoman territory. The Turkish casualties numbered 1,500 dead and 2,500 wounded.  Allied casualties amounted to 800. The allies had captured 12 Ottoman guns. Based on the above article, answer a question.

The story of the untouchable who acted like a great soldier, saving the lives of hundreds if not thousands, is told in the 1939 film \\"Gunga Din.\\" Based loosely on the Rudyard Kipling poem, the film is brilliantly directed by George Stevens and stars Cary Grant, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Victor Mclagen. The title role is played by Sam Jaffe, well known in my era as Ben Casey's boss, Dr. Zorba, a name that became synonymous with big, out of control hair. Say \\"Dr. Zorba hair\\" to anyone of my generation, and they know what you're talking about. Set in India at the time of the British occupation, three soldiers - two romantic, dashing figures in Grant and Fairbanks, and McLagen as a big lug - are cut-ups - in reality, three overgrown boys. Gunga Din is the water carrier, treated somewhat meanly - verbally, anyway - by McChesney (McLaglen), but Cutter (Grant) is fond of him. When he catches Din (pronounced Deen) practicing being his soldier walk and salute as he apes the unit during their maneuvers, Cutter gives him a few pointers. The merry band of musketeers is going to break up when Ballantine (Fairbanks) announces he's about to be married to a lovely young woman (Joan Fontaine) and leaving the service. However, when Gunga Din and Cutter run across Thugees, a murderous cult led by a guru (Eduardo Cianelli), Gunga Din escapes to warn the unit, and Ballantine insists on re-enlisting to help save Cutter. It's a buddy movie after all. \\"Gunga Din\\" starts out lightheartedly, with slapstick and wonderful, broad comedy, particularly by Cary Grant, who is quite funny. Both he and Fairbanks are so handsome, it's hard to decide which one to look at first. Much of the film is made up of huge action sequences which are very exciting. In the last part, the story becomes very dramatic and culminates in a tense, thrilling battle. Grant has the showiest role, Fairbanks is the lovesick romantic, and McLaglen as McChesney, mostly due to his treatment of Gunga Din, is the most unlikeable character, although one detects his soft heart in his love for his elephant Annie. His softness comes through toward the end of the movie, particularly in the very touching, tear-jerking final scene. Always a gentle and likable actor, Sam Jaffe gives a beautiful performance as Gunga Din, a simple, brave man with a big smile, powerful imagination and lofty dreams. Without much dialogue, Jaffe conveys Gunga Din's soul magnificently. This is truly the ultimate adventure film, massive in scope, with good acting, rousing scenes, a wonderful musical score, and some beautiful cinematic images. Another one from that remarkable year, 1939. Highly recommended. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"This review thought positively of the movie.

Whereas jogging and aerobic dancing can _ quickly, walking provides a popular activity that seems to endure. Fitness foundations estimate that 35 million adult Americans walk for exercise every day, with at least 15 million walking two or three times a week. Among the most regular walkers are those 65 years and older--evidence that walking is an exercise that lasts. In addition to its many physical benefits, walking, like other physical activities, has a comforting effect on the psyche. Walking can help you to think more clearly and feel more relaxed. It also can be a sociable activity. An early morning walk around the neighborhood provides an opportunity to chat with friends or simply admire the  flowers. Or because it does not require a team or even a partner, walking is something you can do on your own time, by yourself, whenever the mood strikes. Easily affordable, all you need to start walking is enthusiasm and a pair of comfortable and sturdy low-heeled shoes. Dr.ChristineL. Wells recommends an Oxford-style shoe with ties for better foot support; she does not recommend sneakers or other \\"cheapies\\". If you plan to walk regularly, you might want to invest in a pair of so-called walking shoes. If so, expect to spend at least 35. For walking during the hotter months, early morning or evening hours are best. Clothes should fit loosely and be lightweight and light-colored. Elderly walkers should consider wearing long sleeves, and all Arizonans need to be particularly concerned about skin cancer. Dr. Wells suggests wearing sunscreen as well as a side-brimmed hat to protect your eyes, ears, nose and back of the neck. Walkers also should drink an adequate amount of water. Wells advises drinking an 8-ounce glass of water before you start out, and more when you return. \\"If you walk four miles or more a day in Arizona, I also recommend that you carry a water bottle,\\" she says. \\" And water  is just fine; you don't need those fluid-replacement or...

Here, Sportsmail looks at the three men who will be looking to ruin England's perfect start. Lithuania's Saulius Mikoliunas (second from right) scores to secure a 1-0 win against Estonia in qualifying. Estonia's Karol Mets (right) battles for the ball with Lithuania's Mindaugas Kalonas (left) in Vilnius on Thursday. Waddle’s midfield partner. Magnus Pehrsson. Position: Manager. Age: 38. Previous clubs: Djurgardens, Aalborg, GAIS, IK Sirius, Atvidabergs FF. Only hardcore Bradford City fans will remember Pehrsson’s one-month loan spell in England. With Chris Kamara in charge of the side in 1996, Pehrsson played just once, alongside Chris Waddle in central midfield. Estonia manager Magnus Pehrsson will be hoping to ruin England's perfect start to qualification. Pehrsson played alongside Chris Waddle (pictured) for Bradford during a loan spell back in 1996. Manchester City may also remember Pehrsson. He was manager of Danish side Aalborg, who almost knocked them out of the UEFA Cup in 2009. City were cruising 2-0 ahead from the first leg and there were five minutes to play in the second with the score goalless when Aalborg netted twice, including a stoppage-time penalty. Shay Given was the eventual hero as City edged through 4-3 on penalties. Pehrsson has also worked alongside England manager Roy Hodgson on a number of occasions as a pundit for Swedish television. Blackpool bargain. Sergei Zenjov. Position: Forward. Age: 25. Previous clubs: Karpaty Lviv, TVMK Tallin, Parnu Vaprus. Estonian forward Zenjov was Blackpool manager Jose Riga’s first signing in his so far short but torrid time at the club. Estonia forward Sergei Zenjov, pictured against Shrewsbury, joined Blackpool on a one-year deal in July. He was the first of 14 free or dirt-cheap players as Riga had to sign virtually an entire new first team with barely any money. Zenjov moved from Ukrainian side Karpaty Lvov, where he had spent six years, for free on a one-year deal. He is yet to score for Blackpool in 10 games and they are second-from-bottom in the Championship. But England would be wise not to underestimate him. Zenjov surprised the Italians by scoring against them in a Euro 2012 qualifier. Zenjov looks to keep the pace with Lithuania's Arvydas Novikovas during Estonia's Group E defeat. The Chemist. Rimo Hunt. Position: Striker. Age: 28. Previous clubs: Levadia, Tallinna Kalev, MC Tallin, Kaitseliit Kalev, Haapsalu. Hunt has been nicknamed ‘The Chemist’ back in Estonia due to having completed a degree in chemistry. It is also, apparently, due to his chemistry in the box, according to Estonian media, yet that does not extend to the international scene. Hunt has scored just one goal in five appearances for their national side, and that was in a friendly against Gibraltar, who are not even recognised by FIFA as an official team. He is, however, taking to the Kazakh Premier League well. That is where Hunt now plies his trade, at Kaisar, and he is one of the league’s leading scorers with eight this season, two off the top. Previous to that move, Hunt spent his entire career playing for Estonian club sides. Write highlights for this article.","output":"1.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. George Edward Foreman (born January 10, 1949) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1969 to 1977, and from 1987 to 1997. Nicknamed \\"Big George\\", he is a two-time world heavyweight champion and an Olympic gold medalist. Outside the sport he is an ordained minister, author, and entrepreneur. After a troubled childhood Foreman took up amateur boxing and won a gold medal in the heavyweight division at the 1968 Summer Olympics. In 1972, still undefeated and with an impressive knockout record, Foreman was set to challenge undefeated and Undisputed World Heavyweight Champion Joe Frazier. Despite boycotting a title elimination caused by the vacancy resulting from the championship being stripped from Muhammad Ali, Frazier had won the title from Jimmy Ellis and defended his title four times since, including a 15-round unanimous decision over the previously unbeaten Ali in 1971 after Ali had beaten Oscar Bonavena and Jerry Quarry. Despite Foreman's superior size and reach, he was not expected to beat Frazier and was a 3:1 underdog going into the fight.  The Sunshine Showdown took place on January 22, 1973, in Kingston, Jamaica, with Foreman dominating the fight to win the championship by technical knockout. In ABC's re-broadcast, Howard Cosell made the memorable call, \\"Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier!\\" Before the fight Frazier was 29-0 (25 KO) and Foreman was 37-0 (34 KO). Frazier was knocked down six times by Foreman within two rounds (the three-knockdown rule was not in effect for this bout). After the second knockdown, Frazier's balance and mobility were impaired to the extent that he was unable to evade Foreman's combinations. Frazier managed to get to his feet for all six knockdowns, but referee Arthur Mercante eventually called an end to the one-sided bout.  Foreman was sometimes characterized by the media as an aloof and antisocial champion. According to them, he always seemed to wear a sneer and was not often available to the press. Foreman later attributed his demeanor during this time as an emulation of Sonny Liston, for whom he had been an occasional sparring partner. Foreman defended his title successfully twice during his initial reign as champion. His first defense, in Tokyo, pitted him against Puerto Rican Heavyweight Champion Jose Roman. Roman was not regarded as a top contender, and it took Foreman only 2 minutes to end the fight, one of the fastest knockouts in a Heavyweight Championship bout. Did he collapse eventually after the knockdowns?","output":"Yes, little buddy. After being knocked down six times by George Foreman, Joe Frazier had trouble standing up and moving around properly. Even though he managed to get up from all the knockdowns, he wasn't able to protect himself well. So, the referee, Arthur Mercante, thought it was better to stop the fight to keep Frazier safe. That's how George Foreman won the match and became the heavyweight champion!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I consider Stuart Bliss the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting was terrible and the plot ludicrous. I get the fact that the main character's wife leaving him triggered a mental breakdown, but it got so silly and boring, after a while I could have cared less about any of the characters. The movie kept going over and over the same ideas without anything fresh or surprising to add to the plot. The whole thing with the Geiger counter got too much after a while after Stuart started opening up his wall to see what was behind it after the counter indicated something was there.

The Inner Harbor is located at the mouth of Jones Falls, creating the wide and short northwest branch of the Patapsco River. The district includes any water west of a line drawn between the foot of President Street and the American Visionary Art Museum.  - A central business district (CBD) is the commercial and business centre of a city. In larger cities, it is often synonymous with the city's \\"financial district\\". Geographically, it often coincides with the \\"city centre\\" or \\"downtown\\", but the two concepts are separate: many cities have a central \\"business\\" district located away from its commercial or cultural city centre or downtown. Both the CBD and the city centre or downtown may also coincide with the central activities district.  - A one-way pair, one-way couple, or just couplet is a pair of parallel, usually one-way streets that carry opposite directions of a signed route or major traffic flow, or sometimes opposite directions of a bus or streetcar route.  - Jonestown is a neighborhood in the southeastern district of Baltimore . Its boundaries are the north side of Pratt Street , the west side of Central Avenue , the east side of Fallsway , and the south side of Orleans Street . The neighborhood lies north of the Little Italy , south of the Oldtown , west of the Washington Hill , and east of the Downtown Baltimore neighborhoods . Jonestown is a historical section of southeast Baltimore established in 1732 that was laid out on 10 acres ( 40,000 m2 ) divided into twenty lots on the east side of the Jones Falls . The district is a mix of industrial , commercial and residential buildings . In the last half of the 20th century , Jonestown has shifted from a predominantly Eastern European and Jewish neighborhood into a predominantly African American neighborhood . Public housing replaced many of the former rowhomes and townhouses throughout the area , though a historical presence is still felt . In the early 2000s , though , modern row housing replaced the public housing .

Sentence 2: The museum building retains its European style of oriental modern architecture through the standing bricks on the southeast corner of the building and the classical image of the foyer . Do these two sentences convey the same information?","output":"The two sentences convey similar information, yet there are subtle differences that make them distinct from each other. Upon closer examination, we can identify these differences and compare them, allowing for a better understanding of how they contrast. In Sentence 1, the primary focus is on the \\"classical style of oriental modern architecture.\\" By mentioning \\"the standing bricks on the southeast corner of the building\\" and \\"the European image of the foyer,\\" it highlights the presence of both European and oriental styles. The blending of these styles still results in a predominantly classical theme, but the harmonization represents the distinct architectural quality of the museum. On the other hand, Sentence 2 emphasizes the \\"European style of oriental modern architecture.\\" In this case, the European influence becomes the primary focus, with the mention of \\"the standing bricks on the southeast corner of the building\\" and \\"the classical image of the foyer.\\" Here, the oriental and classical features play a supporting role in presenting the museum's architecture. The central theme has shifted to highlight the dominant European character imbibed within the oriental context. So, while both sentences mention similar architectural elements such as standing bricks on the southeast corner and images in the foyer, they portray different styles as their main subject. Sentence 1 predominantly talks about the \\"classical style of oriental modern architecture,\\" while sentence 2 focuses on the \\"European style of oriental modern architecture.\\" In summary, although these sentences convey similar information about the museum building's design and architectural components, they communicate differing perspectives on the structure. They emphasize distinct styles as their primary concern – classical versus European – which results in a subtle yet fundamental difference in the way they present the museum's architectural essence."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

In a flashback, Frank recalls better times in New York, beginning with Vinnie's homecoming from military service and subsequent marriage to Emma Bertolo (Susan Strasberg). The father of the bride, Dominick Bertolo (Luther Adler) is a Mafia don, as is the groom's brother, Frank. And among those paying their respects as guests at the wedding are mob leaders like Egan (Murray Hamilton), Rotherman (Val Avery) and Levin (Alan Hewitt), who are the equals of Frank and Dominick in the New York region's organized crime. These capos within the Organization meet as a board to coordinate their business. The majority becomes increasingly unhappy with Frank's position, as he seems opposed to every new idea.

As the town's annual cookout competition, 'Grill and Thrill,' approaches, Clint hopes to bring his community together by sharing the joy of a well-cooked meal. Little does he know, a team of notorious culinary criminals are plotting to steal his secret recipes and claim the BBQ championship title for themselves. Act 1: The movie begins by introducing the quaint town of Sunshine Valley, known for its beautiful landscapes, warm-hearted locals, and passion for community events. Clint Clobber, our protagonist, has spent his whole life in the town, mastering his family's secret recipes while taking care of his butchery store. With the 'Grill and Thrill' competition nearing, Clint has worked tirelessly to improve his BBQ technique, even inventing a new sauce that he's sure will win him the title. He decides to host a cookout for the town to give them a taste of what to expect at the championship. As word spreads about Clint's cookout, it reaches the ears of a gang of culinary criminals known as the 'BBQ Bandits' who have been going from town to town to steal recipes and win local food events. They decided to come to Sunshine Valley and participate in the Grill and Thrill to win the trophy and Clint's secret recipe. Act 2: As the day of Clint's cookout arrives, the town is buzzing with excitement. Clint, his friends, and family work together to prepare mouth-watering food and entertainment for the event. Unbeknownst to Clint, the BBQ Bandits have infiltrated the cookout under the guise of a traveling grilling team. The leader of the gang, Gordon Grillin', attempts to befriend Clint, all the while secretly collecting information on his secret sauce recipe. The cookout is a huge success, and the townsfolk are rooting for Clint to take home the Grill and Thrill championship title. Throughout the night, the BBQ Bandits manage to sneak into Clint's store and steal his secret ingredients. However, they don't get their hands on the new sauce that Clint made specifically for the event, as it is hidden in his house. Act 3: On the day of the Grill and Thrill championship, Clint feels that something is off and begins to notice certain similarities between the BBQ Bandits' food and his recipes. Suspicious, he quickly goes back to his store only to discover signs of a break-in. With no time to lose before the final round of cooking, Clint enlists the help of his family and friends to secure his new secret sauce and stealthily switch it back with the ingredient version the BBQ Bandits are using. As the competition reaches its finale, Clint and the BBQ Bandits are the last two contestants standing. In an intense and fiery final cook-off, Clint manages to outshine the BBQ Bandits with his amazing flavors. The BBQ Bandits' plan fails, as the judges instantly recognize the difference between Clint's genuine love and energy in his food and the Bandits' stolen recipe execution. In a community-minded gesture, Clint decides not to press charges against the BBQ Bandits but instead insists that they learn how to cook with passion and kindness at his butchery store. The movie concludes with the small town coming together over the love of BBQ once again, and the BBQ Bandits, with some well-earned humility, learning the true meaning of cooking by heart. Throughout the movie, the audience is treated to laughs, tender moments, and mouth-watering food montages, making Clint Clobber's Cookout Capers a light-hearted and enjoyable culinary comedy for all ages."},{"instruction":"Two groups of adults were a part of a diet experiment.

(CNN) -- Two men convicted of killing a British soldier on a London street last year were sentenced Wednesday, one to life in prison and the other to a minimum of 45 years. In a brutal attack recorded on closed-circuit TV and by bystanders, Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale hit soldier Lee Rigby with a car then hacked him to death with a meat cleaver and knives in May 2013. The Islamic converts, through testimony or their lawyers' arguments in court, indicated they killed Rigby for Allah. Cellphone footage replayed at the trial showed Adebolajo, still clutching a cleaver in his bloody hands, ranting that the killing was \\"an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth\\" for British soldiers killing Muslims overseas. \\"As a solider, Fusilier","output":"Lee Rigby no doubt thought that he might die in the service of his country, but he would not have imagined that he would be brutally murdered by his fellow citizens right in the heart of London,\\" the judge remarked during the sentencing. Michael Adebolajo, 29 at the time of the attack, was given a whole life term, meaning he will not be eligible for parole. Michael Adebowale, who was 22 at the time, was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 45 years before being eligible for parole. The distinction in the terms given to the two men was partly due to the fact that Adebolajo was considered the ringleader and had a history of extremist behavior, whereas Adebowale was seen as a more impressionable individual who followed Adebolajo's lead. The barbaric killing of Lee Rigby shocked not only the UK but the world over. The fact that two radicalized men carried out such a horrific act in broad daylight, with such blatant disregard for the sanctity of human life, exposed the dark underbelly of homegrown terrorism and the radicalization of young men within the country's borders. The trial, which lasted for about six weeks, saw the jury of eight women and four men listen to the harrowing details of the murder. They were shown shocking surveillance footage and images of the two men dragging Rigby's lifeless body onto the road, as if to make a macabre exhibition of it. Eyewitnesses recounted the events of that day, with one describing the scene as resembling \\"a butcher's shop window.\\" Adebolajo's defense lawyer claimed his client was \\"a soldier of Allah\\" and argued that he was motivated by religious beliefs, which justified the murder as an act of war against a British soldier. Adebowale did not take the stand during the trial, and his lawyers did not attempt to justify his actions, but rather, they sought to downplay the religious motivations behind the attack. In the aftermath of the killing, a significant debate arose regarding the role of the UK’s security agencies in preventing radicalization and monitoring the activities of known extremists. Prior to the attack, both Adebolajo and Adebowale were known to the security services and had been linked to extremist organizations. This raised questions about whether the authorities could have done more to prevent the attack. The convoluted and complex issue of radicalization in the UK has been a subject of intense scrutiny since the murder of Lee Rigby. The government initiated various programs to counteract radicalization and homegrown terrorism, such the implementation of the Prevent strategy. This involves identifying individuals at risk of being drawn into terrorism and offering support to prevent the progression towards violent extremism.  Efforts to tackle this issue also extend to online platforms, as a large part of modern radicalization occurs through the internet. Online radicalization is part of the dark side of the digital age, and tackling it presents a unique set of challenges for governments and security services around the world. The sentencing of Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale allowed some measure of justice for Lee Rigby and his family, but the case also served as a stark reminder of the potential danger posed by radicalized individuals within society. The battle against terrorism and radicalization is an ongoing one that requires the collaboration of law enforcement, communities, and individuals alike, in order to protect the values of freedom and democracy that form the very fabric of our society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence from a movie review: chilling movie  Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","output":"The term \\"chilling\\" is often used to describe something that is frightening, intense and thrilling, especially in the context of a movie review. It does not inherently denote a negative or positive opinion as it greatly depends on context and personal preference of the reviewer.  For example, in the realm of horror, thriller, or suspense movies, \\"chilling\\" could be interpreted as a positive review as it suggests the movie is effectively suspenseful, engrossing, and evokes strong emotions. On the other hand, if someone dislikes scariness or intensity in movies, then \\"chilling\\" could be a negative descriptor. However, since the task does not provide much context and is asking based on just the phrase \\"chilling movie,\\" it's difficult to definitively say if the review was positive or negative.  In general, I might lean towards suggesting it could be seen as a positive review (especially for certain genres) because usually if a movie is described as \\"chilling\\", it means it has achieved its purpose in creating a sense of suspense or fear, which are intended reactions for such movies.

There are three times more foreigners in one part of Lincolnshire than previously estimated, while areas in Herefordshire and London have twice as many immigrants. Revised figures from the Office of National Statistics, published this week by the Greater London Authority, have increased the population of London by 130,000, while its immigrant community has gone up by 16 per cent to nearly 950,000. The ONS currently measure the number of immigrants in Britain through voluntary questionnaires filled out at airports and ports. In Boston, Lincolnshire, new statistics show that the number of immigrants in the past five years has trebled to 7,500. While some areas have increased their foreign community as a result of the methodology change, other council areas have seen the number reduced by as much as half. Cambridge, Norwich and Durham all saw their immigrant community numbers reduced. The number of foreigners coming to live, study or work in Britain is currently based on a questionnaire which is filled in at airports and ports, while detailed estimates of where new arrivals settle have been calculated in different ways. The methodology employed by the ONS. sees migrants separated into 'streams', depending on their age and. employment status, and their movements are followed using education,. welfare and health registers. The revised totals, as published by the GLA, have highlighted an apparent shift in the spread of immigrants across the capital. In Newham, east London, there was a 102 per cent rise in the number of immigrants, while Herefordshire (180 per cent) and Aylesbury Vale (104 per cent), also recorded sharp rises. Overall, the estimated number of immigrants arriving for more than 12 months between 2006 and 2010 decreased by 0.4 per cent, to just over 2.5million, under the new system. Sir Andrew Green, chairman of Migration Watch UK, told the Telegraph: 'The impact of immigration on London has been revised up by 130,000 to very nearly one million in just five years. 'This is a measure of the huge churn in our population as a result of mass immigration which has serious consequences for our schools, housing and health services.'

Question: How much is the bounty on Johnson's life? Title: Death Hunt Movie plot: In the Yukon Territory in 1931, Albert Johnson (Charles Bronson), a solitary American trapper, comes across an organized dog fight. A white German Shepherd is badly injured and Johnson forcibly takes it, paying 200 to its owner, a vicious trapper named Hazel (Ed Lauter). Aggrieved by his treatment and claiming the dog was stolen from him, Hazel leads several of his friends to Johnson's isolated cabin. Some begin shooting while others create a diversion. After the shooting of Sitka, the dog that Johnson has nursed back to health, the trapper kills one pursuer, Jimmy Tom (Denis Lacroix), Once they discover that Johnson has bought 700 rounds of ammunition from the local trading post and paid in 100 bills, many conclude that he is the \\"mad trapper\\", a possibly mythical, psychopathic, serial killer who supposedly murders other trappers in the wilderness and takes their gold teeth. An old trapper, Bill Luce (Henry Beckman), warns Johnson that the law is coming for him. Johnson fortifies his cabin. Sergeant Edgar Millen (Lee Marvin), commander of the local Royal Canadian Mounted Police post, seems a tough but humane man. He has a veteran tracker named \\"Sundog\\" Brown (Carl Weathers) and a young constable, Alvin Adams (Andrew Stevens), plus a new lover in Vanessa McBride (Angie Dickinson). He reluctantly agrees to investigate Hazel's accusations that Johnson stole his dog and murdered Jimmy Tom. Millen leads a posse of mounties and trappers to the cabin. He parleys with Johnson, telling him that he has a pretty good idea of what happened and if Johnson comes with him they can get it sorted out. However, before Johnson can answer, one of the trappers opens fire. Several end up killed, including one who is shot by one of his own friends. The posse uses dynamite to blow up the cabin, but Johnson escapes, shooting dead a Mountie, Constable Hawkins (Jon Cedar).

Question: Weight gain is a complex issue. But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten. Question: After eating foods high in salt most of their lives, how are people most likely to be (statistically speaking): Options:  A. Fans of macaroni and cheese.  B. Overweight or obese.

Don't worry, it's just like solving a fun puzzle. So we have: -14*p - 5 = 1 + 22, yes? First, let's put the numbers on the right side of the equation together. So 1 + 22 equals 23.

It's kind of like saying \\"we borrowed five candies and now we need to return them\\". We give them back by adding 5 to both sides of the equation. So then it looks like this: -14*p = 23 + 5.  Let's add 23 and 5 now. That equals 28. So now our equation is: -14*p = 28. Now we only need to find out what 'p' is! As we have -14 multiplied by 'p', to find 'p', we need to do the opposite, it means to divide. So, we go ahead and divide both sides of our equation by -14. It will be like this: p = 28 divided by -14. When we divide 28 by -14, we get -2. Guess what? That's our answer! So 'p' equals -2.  So, you see, it's not that hard!

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Samuel fills a glass cup with water and puts it in the freezer. He leaves the cup of water overnight and when he checks in the morning the cup has shattered. Confused he fills another cup with water and just leaves in on his kitchen counter. When he checks in the morning the glass is in tact.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Will the amount of space water takes up increase or decrease when frozen?  Hint: Hydrogen bonds cause water to have a relatively high boiling point of 100°C (212°F). Because of its high boiling point, most water on Earth is in a liquid state rather than in a gaseous state. Water in its liquid state is needed by all living things. Hydrogen bonds also cause water to expand when it freezes. This, in turn, causes ice to have a lower density (mass/volume) than liquid water. The lower density of ice means that it floats on water. For example, in cold climates, ice floats on top of the water in lakes. This allows lake animals such as fish to survive the winter by staying in the water under the ice. Answer:","output":"The amount of space that water takes up will increase when it is frozen. The reason as to why the glass cup shattered when Samuel left it in the freezer overnight is due to this phenomenon.  This process is primarily due to the unique properties of water and hydrogen bonds. The hydrogen bonds in water cause it to behave differently compared to most other liquids. Water molecules in its liquid state are close together, but when it freezes, these molecules arrange themselves in a hexagonal pattern due to hydrogen bonding. This specific pattern is more spaced out which causes the water to expand and hence takes up more space. The expansion of water when it turns into ice is about 9%, meaning it will occupy more volume in its solid state than it did in its liquid state. When the water in the glass cup started to freeze, it began to expand. However, because the rigid glass couldn't stretch or expand to accommodate the increased volume of the frozen water (now ice), the pressure from the ice against the glass caused the cup to shatter. On the other hand, when Samuel left a cup of water on his kitchen counter, the water remained in its liquid state and did not expand, thus the glass remained intact.  In conclusion, due to the properties of hydrogen bonds, water in its solid state (ice) takes up more space than when it is in its liquid state. The density of ice is less than that of water which is why ice floats on the water. This expansion property of water is also why you see pipes bursting in extremely cold temperatures when the water inside them freezes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Context: More than 90% of anal condyloma is attributed to nonhigh risk strains of human papillomavirus (HPV), thus patients with anal condyloma do not necessarily undergo HPV serotyping unless they are immunocompromised (IC). We hypothesized that IC patients with anal condyloma have a higher risk of high-risk HPV and dysplasia than nonimmunocompromised (NIC) patients.', 'We performed a retrospective chart review of patients who underwent surgical treatment by a single surgeon for anal condyloma from 1/2000 to 1/2012. HPV serotyping was performed on all patient samples. We compared incidence of high-risk HPV and dysplasia in condyloma specimens from IC and NIC patients.', 'High-risk HPV was identified in 14 specimens with serotypes 16, 18, 31, 33, 51, 52, and 67. Twenty-two cases (18.3%) had dysplasia. Invasive carcinoma was identified in one IC patient. The prevalence of dysplasia or high-risk HPV was not significantly different between IC and NIC groups. High-risk HPV was a significant independent predictor of dysplasia (odds ratio [OR] = 5.2; 95% CI = 1.24-21.62). Immune status, however, was not a significant predictor of high-risk HPV (OR = 1.11; 95% CI = 0.16-5.12) nor dysplasia (OR = 0.27; 95% CI = 0.037-1.17). Answer: IC patients did not have a significantly higher prevalence or risk of high-risk HPV or dysplasia in our study. HPV typing of all condylomata, regardless of immune status, should be considered as it may help predict risk of neoplastic transformation or identify NIC patients with an increased risk of developing anal intraepithelial neoplasia.

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ).  I am facing a new situation today: Tom and Jim go running together once a week. This week Jim skipped his warm up before exercising, because he was a bit late. Tom warmed up properly before running.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which runner has a greater chance of getting a tendon injury? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Identify the key information from the background article: - Muscles and tendons can get injured if a person starts an activity without warming up properly. - Warming up prepares muscles for an activity by increasing blood flow and heart rate. - Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. Step 2: Assess the new situation: - Tom and Jim go running together once a week. - This week, Jim skipped his warm up, while Tom warmed up properly. Step 3: Apply the knowledge from the background article to the new situation: - Tom warmed up properly: his muscles and tendons are better prepared for the activity, and he has an effectively reduced risk of injury. - Jim skipped his warm up: his muscles and tendons are not prepared for the activity, which increases his risk of injury.

Second question: What are the safety precautions on handling shotguns proposed by the NRA in the entire U.S. including it’s territories and possessions? 4 Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First Question: What are the safety precautions on handling shotguns proposed by the NRA in Mississippi? The safety precautions on handling shotguns in Mississippi as proposed by the National Rifle Association (NRA) typically follow the same guidelines as the NRA provides across the entire United States. While there may be some specific state laws or regulations that govern the use of shotguns in Mississippi, the NRA advocates for responsible and safe usage of firearms in each state. Some of the essential safety precautions for handling shotguns in Mississippi include: 1. Always treat firearms as if they are loaded: This helps avoid accidents due to mishandling of the shotgun, whether it is loaded or not. 2. Always point the muzzle in a safe direction: This ensures that even if the shotgun is accidentally discharged, the damage or harm will be minimal. 3. Keep your finger off the trigger until you are ready to shoot: This prevents accidental discharge should the firearm be bumped or jostled. 4. Know your target and what is beyond it: It is essential to comprehend the impact of your shot, both on your target and anything else in the background if the shot goes beyond it. 5. Use proper ammunition: Make sure that the ammunition you use is compatible with your shotgun. Incorrect ammunition can lead to damages to the shotgun or cause injuries. 6. Always wear eye and ear protection: Utilize safety glasses and hearing protection to safeguard against any potential hazards while handling or firing a shotgun. 7. Maintain your firearms: Clean and inspect your shotgun regularly to make sure it functions correctly and safely. 8. Store your firearms safely: Keep your firearms locked and secured, away from children or unauthorized individuals. Store your ammunition separately. Second question: What are the safety precautions on handling shotguns proposed by the NRA in the entire U.S. including it’s territories and possessions? The safety precautions mentioned above for handling shotguns in Mississippi also apply across the entire United States and its territories and possessions. The NRA has a set of guidelines for firearm safety nationally, which apply uniformly across the different states and territories, to promote secure and responsible gun handling and usage. Are these two questions asking the same thing? While these two questions may initially appear to be asking different things, the underlying theme is the same. Both are asking about the safety precautions on handling shotguns as proposed by the NRA. The focus on Mississippi in the first question does not significantly change the safety guidelines, as the NRA promotes consistent firearm safety principles across the entire United States, including its territories and possessions. Therefore, the precautions aimed at ensuring safety while handling shotguns will essentially be the same in both cases."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In 2006, Time praised Web 2.0 for enabling \\"community and collaboration on a scale never seen before,\\" and added that YouTube \\"harnesses the stupidity of crowds as well as its wisdom.\\" This statement highlights how YouTube has revolutionized the digital landscape by allowing users to generate content and engage in worldwide conversations. As a video-sharing platform, YouTube empowers people to showcase their creativity, intelligence, talents, and opinions, while also emphasizing the potentially negative aspects, such as misinformation or inappropriate content, that can stem from the collective activity of its user base.  The term \\"wisdom of the crowds\\" was popularized by James Surowiecki in his 2004 book, The Wisdom of Crowds. The theory posits that large groups of people can make better decisions and solve problems more effectively than individuals or smaller groups working independently. YouTube exemplifies this concept as it provides a platform for users to share their knowledge, opinions, and experiences with a vast audience. By crowdsourcing content through the participation and collaboration of users, YouTube has become an essential tool for communication, education, and entertainment. However, it is essential to be aware that the wisdom of the crowds can sometimes be overshadowed by the \\"stupidity of the crowds.\\" This occurs when the collective behavior and opinions of people in an online community result in less desirable outcomes, such as the promotion of false information, harmful content, or digital mob mentality. YouTube, like other social media platforms, is susceptible to these issues, which has compelled the company to continuously improve and implement moderation strategies and community guidelines. In conclusion, Time Magazine's statement in 2006 highlights both the positive and negative aspects that emerge from the massive scale of community and collaboration enabled by Web 2.0 platforms such as YouTube. YouTube indeed harnesses the \\"wisdom and stupidity\\" of humanity, reflecting the potential and challenges that the digital age presents for society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The bus driver would not pull out of the stop until the pram was secured in the wheelchair chocks, however an elderly women wouldn’t give up her seat (seat needed to be folded up in order to make room for the pram in the wheelchair holding apparatus). We sat there for about 4–5 minutes while the driver, the mother and the elderly lady argued. At the end, my wife and I offered our seats (more like a commanding, cajoling, what-she-wanted-to hear, kind of discourse), and the lady moved into our seats. The young couple locked down their pram, and the bus took off. Meg and I stood for the rest of the trip. She was really annoyed over having to move, and there was some baggage attached to her situation—I hate to have to mention the racial aspects here but it’s an important aspect of the story. Most of the passengers were younger white folks (bus was heading through a neighborhood where re-gentrification had taken place). The elderly woman was at least 75 years and the only black person in the front of the crowded bus. She was sitting in a designated seat reserved for elderly or handicapped, and obviously she had earned her status to claim that seat. Unfortunately, it was also the one seat that needed to be vacated if the wheelchair equipment got used. As the bus rode on, her anger simmered. She asked me what I (middle-aged white guy) would do in a spot like that. All I could answer was to offer it up to God.

Plot title: Persona Movie plot: Persona begins with images of camera equipment and projectors lighting up and projecting dozens of brief cinematic glimpses, including a crucifixion, an erect penis, a tarantula spider, clips from a comedic silent-film reel first seen in Bergman's Prison (depicting a man trapped in a room, being chased by Death and Satan), and the slaughter of a lamb. The last, and longest, glimpse features a boy who wakes up in a hospital next to several corpses, reading Michail Lermontov's A Hero of Our Time (\\"Vår Tids Hjälte\\" in the film), and caressing a blurry image of Elisabet and/or Alma's faces.A young nurse, Alma (portrayed by Bibi Andersson), is summoned by the head doctor and charged with the care of stage actress Elisabet Vogler (portrayed by Liv Ullmann), who has, despite the lack of any diagnosed impairment, become mute. The hospital administrator (portrayed by Margaretha Krook) offers her own seaside cottage as a place for Alma to nurse Elisabet back to health. Though Elisabet is nearly catatonic when the film begins, she does react with extreme panic upon seeing a Vietnamese Buddhist monk's self-immolation on television, and laughs mockingly at Alma's radio soap opera.

Question 2: In what circumstances are different types of microscopes useful?  1. no; 2. yes; Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Question 1: What are the different types of microscopes and what are their uses? There are several types of microscopes, each with their specific uses and applications: 1. Optical microscopes: These are the most common type of microscopes, which use visible light to magnify and observe samples. They include:    a. Compound microscopes: These utilize a series of lenses to produce a magnified image of the sample. They are widely used in biological research, education, and diagnostics.        b. Stereo microscopes: Also known as dissecting microscopes, these provide a 3D image of the sample and are often used in dissections, microsurgery, and observation of larger specimens such as insects.     2. Electron microscopes: These use a beam of electrons instead of visible light to observe the sample, providing much higher resolution and magnification. They include:    a. Transmission electron microscopes (TEM): In a TEM, the electron beam passes through a very thin sample, creating an image based on the electrons transmitted. This allows for detailed analysis of the internal structure of cells, tissues, and materials.        b. Scanning electron microscopes (SEM): In SEM, the electron beam scans the surface of the sample, resulting in a high-resolution, 3D image. It's mainly used for surface analysis of materials, insects, and microorganisms.     3. Scanning Probe Microscopes: These microscopes interact with the sample using a very sharp probe, allowing them to observe surface features with high resolution. They include:    a. Atomic force microscopes (AFM): AFMs use a small tip that moves across the sample's surface, detecting forces between the tip and the sample. This allows imaging of individual atoms and molecules, and is used in nanotechnology, materials science, and biology.        b. Scanning tunneling microscopes (STM): STMs employ a sharp tip that is placed close to the sample's surface, and measures the electrical current due to electron tunneling between the tip and the sample. This is used for studying electronic properties, and the structures of atoms and molecules on surfaces. Question 2: In what circumstances are different types of microscopes useful? Various microscopes are useful in different circumstances, mainly depending on the sample being observed and the level of detail required: 1. Optical microscopes: Useful for observing larger, transparent specimens like cells, tissues, and microorganisms, or when a 3D view is needed, as in dissection or microsurgery. 2. Electron microscopes: Useful when higher resolution or magnification is required, such as studying the intricate details of cells, examining the surface topography of materials, and investigating the structural properties of tissues at the nanometer scale. 3. Scanning probe microscopes: Useful when studying surface properties and structures at the atomic or molecular level, or when investigating electrical properties and electronic behavior of surfaces. In conclusion, the answer to these two questions is not precisely the same. The first question sought information about the different types of microscopes and their uses, while the second question delves into the circumstances that make specific types of microscopes useful. Overall, the answers complement each other and provide a more comprehensive understanding of microscopes and their applications."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose if the molecules are too large happens, how will it affect LESS waste being removed from the body.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the perturbation you propose, where the molecules are too large to pass through the kidney's filtration system, would have a direct effect on the waste removal process in the body. To better understand the impact, let's take a closer look at the kidney's filtering process: 1. Blood enters the kidney through the renal artery, which splits into smaller blood vessels called glomeruli. 2. Glomeruli are a network of capillaries surrounded by the Bowman's capsule, which is the beginning of the nephron, the functional unit of the kidney. 3. As blood flows through the glomeruli, waste, water, and small molecules are filtered out from the bloodstream into the Bowman's capsule. This initial filtrate includes waste products like urea, creatinine, and various electrolytes. 4. This filtrate flows through the nephron's tubules, where essential nutrients, electrolytes, and water are selectively reabsorbed back into the bloodstream, and waste products become more concentrated. 5. After flowing through numerous loops and tubules, the purified blood exits the nephron, while the concentrated waste products form urine, which is transported to the bladder and eventually excreted. In the perturbation scenario you propose, if the waste molecules are too large to pass through the filtering system in the glomeruli, they would remain in the bloodstream and not be filtered out. This would potentially cause the following issues: 1. Accumulation of waste in the bloodstream: Since larger waste molecules are not efficiently removed, they would continue to accumulate in the bloodstream, potentially leading to toxicity and damage to various organs and systems in the body. 2. Reduced efficiency of kidney function: Inability to filter out larger waste molecules would hinder the primary function of the kidneys, leading to an overall reduction in their ability to efficiently cleanse the bloodstream and maintain proper electrolyte balance. 3. Impact on downstream bodily processes: Since these larger waste molecules are not properly removed, they may continue to circulate throughout the body, potentially impairing various organs and causing indirect effects on the overall homeostasis and healthy functioning of the body systems. To summarize, the perturbation where molecules are too large to pass through the kidney's filtration system would have a direct effect on the waste removal process and would indirectly affect other bodily processes as well, potentially leading to unhealthy consequences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If you enjoy romantic comedies then you will find this tale of two 30 year old singles who fall in love during the American League pennant race satisfying. On the other hand, if you are hanging around waiting for Kill Bill Volume 3 or Sin City 2 then you probably should stay away. The plot contains the obligatory guy meets girl's friends, girl meets guy's friends, and guy meets girl's parents scenes. There is even a guy meets girl's pet dog scene. That's all par for the course in a movie like this. However, what I liked about it was that the plot delved into the decision making process people make as they begin to realize that their romantic interest is not perfect and is in fact a bit quirky. The plot centers around answering the questions; how much quirkiness is too much and how much love does it take to trump those quirks? It is interesting to see the characters work that out because deep down (if we admit it) we all have quirks. Barrymore does a very good job in her role and Fallon sorta surprised me -- he's good as well. I rate it a 7 out of 10 as a romantic comedy.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What band's members testified before Congress?, using the article: The band members grew uncomfortable with their success, with much of the burden of Pearl Jam's popularity falling on frontman Vedder. While Pearl Jam received four awards at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards for its video for \\"Jeremy\\", including Video of the Year and Best Group Video, the band refused to make a video for \\"Black\\" in spite of pressure from the label. This action began a trend of the band refusing to make videos for its songs. Vedder felt that the concept of music videos robbed listeners from creating their own interpretations of the song, stating that \\"Before music videos first came out, you'd listen to a song with headphones on, sitting in a beanbag chair with your eyes closed, and you'd come up with your own visions, these things that came from within. Then all of a sudden, sometimes even the very first time you heard a song, it was with these visual images attached, and it robbed you of any form of self-expression.\\" The United States Department of Justice was investigating the company's practices at the time and asked the band to create a memorandum of its experiences with the company. Band members Gossard and Ament testified at a subcommittee investigation on June 30, 1994 in Washington, D.C. Pearl Jam alleged that Ticketmaster used anti-competitive and monopolistic practices to gouge fans. After Pearl Jam's testimony before Congress, Congressman Dingell (D-Mich.) wrote a bill requiring full disclosure to prevent Ticketmaster from burying escalating service fees.

They alleged that Ticketmaster, a ticket-selling company, used anti-competitive and monopolistic practices to exploit fans with high service fees. This testimony resulted from the United States Department of Justice's investigation into Ticketmaster's practices at the time, and it prompted Pearl Jam to share their own experiences with the company. The band's negative experience with Ticketmaster and their dissatisfaction with the company's practices led them to contribute to the ongoing investigation.

Premise: Increasing national saving is an important way to bolster retirement security for current workers and to allow future workers to more easily bear the costs of financing federal retirement and health programs while maintaining their standard of living. Hypothesis: Decreasing national saving is important to bolstering retirement security. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. In fact, the hypothesis contradicts the premise. To understand why this is the case, let's first break down the key elements of the premise and hypothesis before analyzing their relationship. Premise: 1. Increasing national saving is an important way to bolster retirement security for current workers. 2. Increasing national saving also allows future workers to more easily bear the costs of financing federal retirement and health programs while maintaining their standard of living. Hypothesis: 1. Decreasing national saving is important for bolstering retirement security. The premise clearly advocates for increasing national saving in order to achieve two main goals: bolstering retirement security for current workers and easing the financial burden on future workers in terms of financing federal retirement and health programs. The argument is that increasing national saving can lead to positive outcomes for both present and future generations of workers. On the other hand, the hypothesis suggests that decreasing national saving is important to bolstering retirement security, which contradicts the premise. The premise argues for an increase in national saving to accomplish the goal of retirement security, whereas the hypothesis proposes a decrease in national saving to achieve the same goal. These two propositions are in direct opposition to each other, which means that the premise does not entail the hypothesis. Understanding why increasing national saving can have positive effects on retirement security and the financial burden on future generations can further highlight the contradiction between the premise and the hypothesis.  When national savings increase, it means that individuals, businesses, and the government are collectively saving more of their income. This can lead to higher levels of investment in productive assets, capital creation, and economic growth over time. In turn, this can help create a better-funded social security system, improved healthcare infrastructure, and a higher standard of living for both current and future workers. Decreasing national saving, as suggested by the hypothesis, would likely have the opposite effect. Lower national saving rates may result in reduced investments, slower economic growth, and increased financial burdens on the government and citizens. This could potentially weaken the availability of funds for federal retirement and health programs, jeopardizing retirement security and putting a strain on future generations of workers. In conclusion, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. Instead, the hypothesis contradicts the premise by asserting that decreasing national saving – rather than increasing it – is important for bolstering retirement security."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - An individual time trial (ITT) is a road bicycle race in which cyclists race alone against the clock on flat or rolling terrain, or up a mountain road such as Alpe d'Huez (in French: \\"contre la montre\\"  literally \\"against the watch\\", in Italian: \\"tappa a cronometro\\" \\"stopwatch stage\\"). There are also track-based time trials where riders compete in velodromes, and team time trials (TTT). ITTs are also referred to as \\"the race of truth\\", as winning depends only on each rider's strength and endurance, and not on help provided by team-mates and others riding ahead and creating a slipstream. The opening stage of stage race will often be a short individual time trial called a prologue.  - The Netherlands  is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

Q:-  They secrete digestive juice &#x27;externally&#x27; into the small intestine - There are enzymes for breaking down fats, proteins , and carbohydrates - Digestive juices flows from the pancreas through an excretory duct into the small intestine - When the blood sugar levels rise, as they might after a meal, insulin is released - When blood sugar levels are too low, the pancreas releases glucagon into the bloodstream -   What might be the first step of the process? A:","output":"The first step of the process is the detection of food entering the small intestine. When food enters the small intestine after being partially digested in the stomach, the presence of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates stimulates the release of certain hormones like secretin and cholecystokinin (CCK). These hormones, in turn, signal the pancreas to secrete its digestive juices (also known as pancreatic juices) externally into the small intestine. These juices contain enzymes like pancreatic amylase, lipase, and protease, which help break down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins respectively, further aiding in the digestion and absorption of nutrients."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Bea, a five-year-old girl, was born with a severe illness which means she has to be kept away from other children of her age, because her body is so weak that she would be unable to fight off a common cold. Bea was diagnosed with this disease when she was five months old. Since then, the hospital has become her second home, medicines for food, and all kinds of treatments her friends. Bea received a very special treatment when she was four years old, which would allow her to be like a normal child if successful. After that, she spent two weeks in ICU before living for four months on a separate ward . Bea was allowed home in February but still needed a special tube in her nose to send in medicines every two days. Her parents clean the house from top to bottom every two days and hoover each morning to make sure Bea is free from any possible bacteria. Anna, Bea's mother, said, \\"she is weak but so strong. We've never seen any child stronger than her. It seems as if nothing in the world could beat her. We really hope to send her to school next year.\\" She used to drive on the local playground, but Bea was only allowed to watch sitting in the car. \\"It was heartbreaking to see Bea staring at the running and laughing children there. She never stopped fighting the disease.

Answer:","output":"Spitfire beer is brewed in Faversham by Shepherd Neame, a renowned British brewery with a rich history dating back to 1698. This makes it the oldest operating brewery in the United Kingdom. The company has established a strong reputation over the centuries, well-known for producing a wide range of high-quality, traditional, and innovative beers. Faversham, a historic market town in the county of Kent, England, is famous for its picturesque setting, lovely landscapes and charming architecture, whilst also providing the ideal environment for brewing beer, thanks to the availability of pure water and excellent hop-growing conditions. The proximity to the local hop gardens ensures that Shepherd Neame has constant access to fresh, high-quality ingredients required for the brewing process. Founded by Captain Richard Marsh, the brewery was eventually inherited by his wife, who later married Julius Shepherd. Julius then formed a partnership with John Neame in 1741, and thus the Shepherd Neame name came into existence. Over the years, the company has expanded and grown due to their commitment to traditional brewing techniques, combined with a persistent focus on innovation to meet the ever-evolving tastes of modern consumers. The Spitfire beer is an iconic example of Shepherd Neame's dedication to quality and striking flavors. Brewed to mark the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in 1990, Spitfire is a popular Kentish ale named in honor of the legendary Supermarine Spitfire aircraft, which played a vital role during the Second World War. This well-balanced, amber ale boasts of a delicious blend of fruity, bitter, and sweet notes, resulting from the carefully selected malts and hops used during its brewing process. Shepherd Neame's Spitfire beer quickly gained popularity upon its release and has since garnered a loyal following, both in the UK and abroad, while also receiving numerous awards in various beer competitions. The brewery produces a range of other beers too, like the classic Bishops Finger, Whitstable Bay Blonde Lager, and Bear Island Triple Hop, offering a diverse selection of tastes catering to different preferences. In conclusion, Spitfire beer is brewed by Shepherd Neame, a distinguished British brewery with a long-standing heritage nestled in the picturesque town of Faversham, Kent. The brewery is celebrated for its premium beers made from locally sourced ingredients, blending passion, tradition, and innovation, of which Spitfire is a prime example."},{"instruction":"- years active is 1984 -- present    - caption is frost serio in 2008 . in the studio after his recording session with    - birth name is arturo molina , jr. .    - origin is windsor , california , united states    - label is virgin , ruthless , koch , low profile    - genre is latin rap , gangsta rap , electro      - alias is kid frost gangsta frost og kid frost    - birth date is 31 may 1964      - background is solo_singer    - image is kid-frost . jpg    - birth place is windsor , california , u.s.

Apply a coat of primer to help the paint adhere to the wood. Allow the wood to dry and cure.\\"","output":"Title: A Comprehensive Guide to Protecting and Enhancing the Beauty of Raw Wood through Proper Cleaning, Sealing, Priming, and Painting Introduction Wood, in its natural state, has an irresistible charm and warmth that has made it a favorite choice for furniture, flooring, and other home decor projects. However, unfinished or raw wood can be vulnerable to damage from environmental factors such as moisture, fungi, and insects. In addition, painting raw wood can be a challenging task due to its porous nature, which can lead to an uneven coat or paint being absorbed too deeply into the wood. Fortunately, by following a few crucial steps - cleaning, sealing, priming, and finally painting - you can ensure that your wooden furnishings and accents remain protected while maintaining their visual appeal. In this article, we'll delve into each of these steps in detail, so your woodwork ends up looking nothing short of stunning. 1. Cleaning the Raw Wood Surface The first step in preparing raw wood for sealing and painting is to thoroughly clean its surface. This will eliminate any dirt, dust, and debris that may have settled on the wood, ensuring optimal adhesion of subsequent coats. To clean the raw wood, use a fine-bristle brush to first remove any loose dirt and debris. Follow this by wiping the wood with a damp cloth to eliminate remaining dust particles. Ensure that the cloth is merely damp and not soaking wet, to minimize moisture exposure to the wood. Allow the wood to dry completely before moving on to the next step. 2. Applying the Sealant Sealants are essential for protecting raw wood from damage by creating a barrier against moisture, fungi, and insects. They also help in maintaining the wood's natural color and texture. Apply two coats of high-quality, water-resistant sealant, following the manufacturer's instructions. Use a brush or cloth to apply the sealant uniformly, ensuring complete coverage. Make sure to allow ample drying time between the coats, as recommended by the product guidelines. The sealed wood should have an even, uniform appearance once it has dried. 3. Priming the Wood Surface A primer provides an optimal surface for paint to adhere to by sealing the pores of the raw wood. This step is paramount in ensuring a smooth and evenly colored paint finish. Choose a high-quality, wood-specific primer, and apply a thin, even coat, covering the entire surface. Work in the direction of the wood grain for the best results, and make sure not to leave drips or puddles. Allow the primer to dry completely, as indicated in the product instructions. In case of any brush marks or drips, lightly sand the surface with fine-grit sandpaper to achieve a smooth finish, and then remove residual dust with a clean, damp cloth. 4. Painting the Primed Wood With the wood surface primed and ready, it's now time to add that perfect splash of color. Use high-quality paint formulated for wooden surfaces, and select a paint method (brush, roller, or spray) based on your comfort level and desired outcome. Before applying paint, always stir or shake the can well to ensure a uniform consistency. Begin by applying a thin, even coat, working in the direction of the wood grain. Allow the paint to dry as per the manufacturer's recommendations, and then assess the coverage. If the desired level of opacity is not achieved, apply additional coats until the desired result is reached, allowing for proper drying time in between each application. Conclusion By following these detailed steps – cleaning, sealing, priming, and painting – you can protect and enhance the aesthetic appeal of your raw wood furnishings with confidence. With proper preparation and technique, your wood creations will have a long-lasting, professional finish that you can take pride in and enjoy for years to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Opening in select U.S. theaters next week, the documentary \\"Putin's Kiss\\" tells the story of a Russian teenager who became famous in the mid-2000s when she was shown on TV giving President Vladimir Putin a kiss on the cheek. Danish filmmaker Lise Birk Pedersen's movie is well-timed. Putin won his third term as Russia's president last month and will officially take power in May. He is finishing up a stint as prime minister, as he was limited to two consecutive terms as president. While not well-known in the West, Masha Drokova will always be a symbol of Putin's power and of the first generation to come of age in post-Soviet Russia, after her tumultuous tenure as the spokeswoman for Nashi, a nationalist youth movement that Putin officials created in 2005.

Pedersen's film explores the methods deployed by the Nashi in suppressing dissenting voices and how these actions impacted Masha's perspective on the political realities of Russia. With interviews and accounts from both die-hard Nashi members and vocal critics, the documentary serves as a compelling exploration of how Putin's administration manipulates and molds the minds of Russia's youth for their political gain. As the film progresses, the audience witnesses Masha's transformation from an unwavering devotee to an increasingly skeptical figure who begins to grapple with moral dilemmas. This change is precipitated by her encounters with independent journalists and exposure to the harsh realities of the political climate in Russia, including the intimidation and silencing of dissenters. As Masha learns more about the nefarious practices perpetrated by the Nashi and the truth about Putin's regime, her loyalty to the organization and devotion to its leader begins to wane. Masha's journey serves as a microcosm of the broader struggles faced by her generation in post-Soviet Russia. Young people who came of age amid political uncertainty and economic turmoil are constantly being torn between the nostalgic ideals of Russia's past and the desire for progress and democracy. In a society where free speech and dissent are often met with brutal repression, Masha's decision to distance herself from the Nashi and the Putin regime reflects a growing awareness among Russian youth about the importance of individual thought and the freedom to challenge authority. By highlighting Masha's experience, Pedersen's documentary exposes the tactics employed by the Kremlin to indoctrinate the Russian youth and perpetuate its hold on power. \\"Putin's Kiss\\" also showcases the courage and resilience of individuals like Masha who dare to question the political establishment and advocate for change, despite the potential consequences. In conclusion, \\"Putin's Kiss\\" presents a captivating insight into the intertwined lives of Masha Drokova, the Nashi movement, and Vladimir Putin's regime. The film documents Masha's transformation as a symbol of Putin's power to a disillusioned advocate for democracy, highlighting the unique challenges faced by the first generation to come of age in post-Soviet Russia. This well-timed documentary serves as a compelling examination of the Russian political landscape and an important reminder of the power of critical thinking and dissent in the face of government control."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Multi-select problem: How does the next paragraph end? How to stop dogs from biting  Keep a puppy with its mother and siblings for ten weeks.  Let your dog's original family shoulder some of the teaching load before your family takes over the job.  For dogs, as with other animals including humans, an important function of play is instruction. Choose from:  (1). This sets up the structure of the puppy's body. Gradually add additional curriculum to these groups to further teach your dog effective play..  (2). Puppies do not need constant sitting and waiting periods while they are left alone. Rather than consistently trying to teach the dogs to sit, they should consistently get practice with their owners, can ask for supervision, and can be comfortably held for hours on end without being bitten..  (3). Puppies use yelps of pain and refusal to keep playing to instruct each other about the differences between playful mouthing and painful biting. Mothers likewise play an important instructive role in the formative weeks of a puppy's life, one that is hard to replicate or replace..  (4). Puppies ought to learn a lot more quickly through their mother and siblings than from strangers.

Puppies use yelps of pain and refusal to keep playing to instruct each other about the differences between playful mouthing and painful biting. Mothers likewise play an important instructive role in the formative weeks of a puppy's life, one that is hard to replicate or replace. Explanation: The question is about how the paragraph ends, and we are looking for an option that is relevant to the topic of stopping dogs from biting and connects to the idea of learning from their original family. (1) is incorrect because it talks about the structure of the puppy's body and additional curriculum, which is not related to teaching them not to bite. (2) is incorrect because it talks about sitting and waiting periods and holding puppies for hours, which again doesn't focus on teaching them not to bite. (4) is incorrect because, although it mentions learning from the mother and siblings, it places importance on supervision from the owner instead of focusing on learning from the original family. Option (3) is the correct answer because it talks about how puppies use their playtime to learn the difference between playful mouthing and painful biting, with both their siblings and mother playing important roles in their learning process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Chapter 27 is a 2007 biographical drama film depicting the murder of John Lennon by Mark David Chapman. It was written and directed by Jarrett Schaefer, based on the book Let Me Take You Down by Jack Jones, produced by Robert Salerno, and stars Jared Leto as Chapman. The film takes place in December 1980, and is intended to be an exploration of Chapman's psyche. Its title is a reference to J. D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, which has twenty-six chapters, and suggests a continuation of the book. The real Mark David Chapman is currently incarcerated at Wende Correctional Facility, on a guilty plea. Aside from two interviews with Larry King and Barbara Walters, both in 1992, he has not spoken with the media. However, Chapman did reveal the mechanics of his unraveling during those three days in New York City to journalist Jack Jones. The interviews were published in 1992 as Let Me Take You Down: Inside the Mind of Mark David Chapman, a book of Chapman's recollections of his act of violence. Chapter 27 is based on this text. The title \\"Chapter 27\\" suggests a continuation of J. D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, which has twenty-six chapters, and which Chapman was carrying when he shot John Lennon. Chapman was obsessed with the book, to the point of attempting to model his life after its protagonist, Holden Caulfield.  According to the British music magazine Mojo, the title was also inspired by Chapter 27 of Robert Rosen's book Nowhere Man: The Final Days of John Lennon (2000). Rosen's book explores the numerological meaning of the number 27, \\"the triple 9\\", a number of profound importance to John Lennon. Lennon was deeply interested in numerology, particularly Cheiro's Book of Numbers, along with nine and all its multiples. It was Chapman's goal, according to Rosen, to write Chapter 27 \\"in Lennon's blood\\".  Like Chapman, Schaefer is a fan of both The Beatles and J.D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, and said he began the script to try to understand \\"how someone could be inspired to kill anyone as a result of being exposed to this kind of beautiful art. It really bothered me, because Lennon and Salinger have always made me feel so much better, and so much less alone.\\" Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","output":"Yes, there are other interesting aspects in this explanation about the movie Chapter 27.

The explanation also mentions that John Lennon, the person Chapman murdered, was interested in numerology and the number 27. The movie's title, Chapter 27, refers to the idea that Chapman was trying to write this extra chapter in Lennon's blood. Lastly, the director of the movie, Jarrett Schaefer, said he created the film to understand why someone might be motivated to kill after being exposed to beautiful art like that of Lennon and J. D. Salinger."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

The Gorge mountains in Gorge county are made of sedimentary rocks, predominantly limestone. They were exposed to water and that lead to karst lanscapes, caves, blue holes, stalactites and stalagmites.  and a hint : About 10% of sedimentary rocks are limestones. The solubility of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to karst landscapes, in which water erodes the limestone over thousands to millions of years. Most cave systems are through limestone bedrock.  Please answer this question : Which of the two mountains had less sedimentary rock? Answer:","output":"The Berg mountains in Berg county had less sedimentary rock as compared to the Gorge mountains in Gorge county. The difference in the composition of rocks between the two mountain ranges can be attributed to their formation processes and the geological characteristics that have shaped them over time. The Berg mountains are of volcanic origin, which suggests that they predominantly consist of igneous rocks. Igneous rocks form when magma from volcanic eruptions cools and solidifies, creating a massive and dense structure characterized by distinctive textures and mineral compositions. The lack of caves and karst features in these mountains further confirm their non-sedimentary nature. On the other hand, the Gorge mountains are made up predominantly of sedimentary rocks, particularly limestone. Sedimentary rocks are formed from accumulated layers of mineral and organic particles (sediments) that have undergone compaction and cementation over time. In the case of limestone, this sedimentary rock is primarily composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) derived from the remains of marine organisms that lived in vast shallow seas that were present millions of years ago. The presence of various karst features, including caves, blue holes, stalactites, and stalagmites, indicates that the Gorge mountains have been subject to water erosion over thousands to millions of years, as hinted in the provided information. Limestone is highly soluble in water and weak acid solutions, which helps explain the formation of these distinct features. The fact that about 10% of sedimentary rocks are limestones further indicates the strong connection between limestone bedrock and the formation of cave systems. In conclusion, the Berg mountains experienced less sedimentary rock formation due to their volcanic origins and the predominance of igneous rocks. The Gorge mountains, rich in limestone and developed karst landscapes, display a higher amount of sedimentary rocks, specifically those of the limestone variety."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Use a tape measure and measure the width and length of the space you want to cover with subway tiles. Multiply these numbers by each other. This will give you the total area you want to tile. Afterwards, add 10% to the total to cover potential waste. If you have a 10-foot (3 m) section that is 2.5 (.76 m) high, you have an area of 25 square feet (7.6 square meters) to cover. To cover waste, you’ll add 2.5 square feet (.76 square meters) in addition. This will give you a total of 27.5 square feet (8.4 square meters) of subway tile you will need to purchase. Use a flathead screwdriver and unscrew the plastic covers from the outlets and light switches. After removing them, place the screws and the covers in plastic bags so you don’t lose any pieces. You’ll replace the covers once you’ve installed your backsplash. Start by determining how many tiles can fit vertically and horizontally in the area you want to cover. Next, figure out where you need to place partial pieces of tile (pieces that you will cut). A lot of this depends on your taste. Finally, take a pencil and draw on the wall where you plan to place individual tiles.  Factor in 1/8th of an inch (.32 cm) between tiles and the wall for grout lines. You may want to choose between centering whole pieces of tile or starting at the top with whole pieces and finishing the bottom with cut/partial pieces (if there isn’t enough space for whole pieces). After you’ve sketched your design on the wall, you should assemble all of the pieces you need to complete your project. It is best to lay out your pieces on a large table or on the floor in another room. This way, you’ll be able to match the pieces to the places on the wall where they will go. Don’t cut any partial pieces yet. Set aside all of the pieces you’ll need to cut partial pieces. After placing full pieces on your wall, you may find that the size of the partial pieces you’ll need is a little different than what you anticipated. Use a cloth or plastic to cover anything you want to protect from adhesive, grout, and caulk. Most importantly, place cloth or plastic over your countertops, on appliances, and on any furniture in the immediate area. Secure drop clothes to countertops and appliances with painter’s tape. Take the time to systematically cover the edges of cabinets, appliances, and woodwork. This way, you’ll protect cabinets and more from being stained with grout or caulk. When your sandpaper wears out and isn’t as abrasive, use a fresh piece. Make sure you sand the entire surface that you are tiling. Sanding will make it easier for the tile to adhere to the wall. Summary:","output":"The article provides a step-by-step guide on how to cover an area with subway tiles.

It means the speaker is stating that they heard something in the past. 2. \\"hänen lisäksi\\" (him also or in addition to him) - This phrase indicates that something was said not only by another person but also by the person being referred to with 'hänen' (him/her). 3. \\"sanovan\\" (to say) - This is the present active participle form of the verb \\"sanoa\\" (to say), and it is used to describe the action of the other person who mentioned the information. 4. \\"että\\" (that) - This is a conjunction that is used to introduce a subordinate clause, which contains the main information about the sentence - the decision to allocate 5 million euros for Europol's use. 5. \\"olemme päättäneet\\" (we have decided) - This phrase contains the verb \\"päättää\\" (to decide) in the first-person plural past participle form, indicating that the decision was made by a collective group, \\"we.\\" 6. \\"antaa\\" (to give or to allocate) - This is the infinitive form of the verb, and it's used to describe the action of providing the funds. 7. \\"Europolin käyttöön\\" (for the use of Europol) - The noun \\"Europol\\" refers to the European Union's law enforcement agency. The suffix \\"in\\" is added to the noun to indicate possession. \\"Käyttöön\\" (use) is a noun in the translative case, expressing the purpose for the allocation of funds. 8. \\"5 miljoonaa euroa\\" (5 million euros) - This phrase specifies the amount of money being allocated for Europol's use. \\"Miljoonaa\\" (million) is the partitive form of \\"miljoona\\" (million), and it is used when expressing large numbers. The currency, \\"euroa\\" (euros), is also in partitive form, as one would expect in Finnish. So, by translating each element and combining them together, you get the English sentence: \\"I heard him also say that we have decided to allocate 5 million euros for the use of Europol.\\""},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

It comes after US rival Nike decided to end its association at the end of the 2014-15 season. Nike has been paying United £23.5m a year, and the new deal is worth a world record-breaking £75m (128m) a season to the Old Trafford club. Champions League winner Real Madrid's £31m-a-year deal with Adidas was previously the biggest club deal. Adidas will provide training and playing kit to all the club's teams and will have the exclusive right to distribute dual-branded merchandising products worldwide. The huge sum involved is only £40m less than the Glazer family paid for the club in 2005. Adidas chief executive Herbert Hainer said the deal would help the firm \\"to further strengthen our position in key markets around the world\\". He added: \\"We expect total sales to reach £1.5bn during the duration of our partnership.\\" Adidas has not given any details about the design of the new strip but said they may look to the Manchester United kits of the 1980s and early 1990s for inspiration. It will be the first time Adidas has made the Premier League's team's strip in 23 years, since the 1991-92 season. The announcement comes a day after the German firm, a Fifa World Cup sponsor, provided the kit for 2014 finalists Germany and Argentina. In trading on the German stock exchange on Monday, the firm's shares closed up by 2.73%. Adidas also supplies Bayern Munich, Chelsea, AC Milan and Flamengo. From the 2015-16 season, they will also provide kit for Juventus. Sean Hamil, director of the Sport Business Centre at London's Birkbeck College, said that the Glazers had put in place \\"an exceptional marketing and sponsorship team\\",  although they had taken flak for the way they had put debt onto the club's books and for increasing season ticket prices. He said: \\"They have been able to secure this landmark deal in the sector, against the background of no Champions League football next season. This is clearly a major vote of confidence in the Manchester United brand. \\"Also, it shows that leading English clubs are sufficiently robust in terms of global appeal that sponsors are making value decisions based on the long term and not just around one season.\\" Dr Leah Donlan, a marketing expert at Manchester Business School, said the deal will give Adidas \\"a significant competitive advantage\\" over Nike. She added that Adidas could \\"strengthen its global brand position\\" by adding Manchester United to its portfolio of teams. Nike had been given a period of exclusivity to negotiate an extension with United and also retained the right to match any other offer. But the company decided against exercising either option, claiming the terms \\"did not represent good value for Nike's shareholders\\". Manchester United suffered their worst Premier League finish to date last season after manager Sir Alex Ferguson left following 26 years in the job. His successor, David Moyes, lasted just 10 months as the club failed to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in 19 years. United will now be managed by Louis van Gaal, whose commitments with the Netherlands are over following the climax of the World Cup. The club has already unveiled the last MUFC kit bearing the Nike logo. It features Chevrolet as shirt sponsor for the first time. The US motor giant is said to be paying £53m a year to have its name splashed on the red shirt fronts.

Answer a question about this article: The apparently sudden appearance of nearly modern flowers in the fossil record initially posed such a problem for the theory of evolution that it was called an \\"abominable mystery\\" by Charles Darwin. However, the fossil record has considerably grown since the time of Darwin, and recently discovered angiosperm fossils such as Archaefructus, along with further discoveries of fossil gymnosperms, suggest how angiosperm characteristics may have been acquired in a series of steps. Several groups of extinct gymnosperms, in particular seed ferns, have been proposed as the ancestors of flowering plants, but there is no continuous fossil evidence showing exactly how flowers evolved. Some older fossils, such as the upper Triassic Sanmiguelia, have been suggested. Based on current evidence, some propose that the ancestors of the angiosperms diverged from an unknown group of gymnosperms in the Triassic period (245–202 million years ago). Fossil angiosperm-like pollen from the Middle Triassic (247.2–242.0 Ma) suggests an older date for their origin. A close relationship between angiosperms and gnetophytes, proposed on the basis of morphological evidence, has more recently been disputed on the basis of molecular evidence that suggest gnetophytes are instead more closely related to other gymnosperms.[citation needed] What fossil evidence is lacking when it comes to flowers?","output":"When it comes to flowers, the fossil evidence that is lacking is a continuous or clear series of fossils that show exactly how flowers evolved from their ancestors.

Does \\"Chinese people who arrived in the country after the end of apartheid do not qualify for such benefits.\\" correctly answer the question of Why was this classification made?","output":"The statement, \\"Chinese people who arrived in the country after the end of apartheid do not qualify for such benefits,\\" might offer partial clarification, but it does not provide a comprehensive answer to the question, \\"Why was this classification made?\\" To better address the question, we need to delve into the historical context and understand the intent behind making such classifications. Apartheid was a policy of institutionalized racial segregation and discrimination that was enforced in South Africa between 1948 and the early 1990s. This system was based on the notion of white superiority and aimed to systematically suppress non-white populations. Consequently, South Africa witnessed an array of laws and practices that promoted racial inequality. In 1994, apartheid was officially abolished, leading to the establishment of a democratic government in South Africa. The new government, mainly led by the African National Congress, sought to redress the injustices of apartheid by implementing programs aimed at uplifting previously marginalized communities. This included affirmative action policies, land reform, and social and economic programs to level the playing field for those who had suffered racial injustice for decades. Due to a combination of political, social, and historical factors, South Africa has a complex racial categorization system. People are classified into groups such as African, Coloured, Indian, and White, among others. During apartheid, the Chinese community in South Africa was categorized as \\"non-white,\\" which meant they were subjected to the same discriminatory laws and practices faced by other non-white communities. However, after apartheid ended, some states in the country considered this community to be \\"non-Black\\" and classified them as part of the \\"Coloured\\" or \\"Indian\\" groups. This new classification generated confusion and controversy among the Chinese community. In 2008, the Chinese Association of South Africa won a lawsuit, arguing that South African Chinese who had been victims of apartheid should enjoy similar benefits as other marginalized communities. As a result, the High Court ruled that South African Chinese people who had been in the country before and during apartheid could qualify for affirmative action and other benefits designed to redress racial imbalances. This decision was extended only to those Chinese people who had lived in South Africa and experienced apartheid, for they had endured similar plights and discrimination as other non-white population groups. The classification mentioned in the statement—\\"Chinese people who arrived in the country after the end of apartheid do not qualify for such benefits\\"—was likely made to distinguish between those who experienced apartheid and those who arrived in South Africa after the system had been dismantled. The idea was to allocate affirmative action and reparative benefits to the people who endured the injustices of apartheid, rather than the newcomers who did not face those challenges. To summarize, the classification was made to differentiate between Chinese immigrants who faced apartheid and those who arrived after the system had ended. It aimed to ensure that the affirmative action and other benefits designed to redress racial imbalances only applied to the communities who had suffered under the apartheid regime, and not to the post-apartheid Chinese immigrants who did not experience those challenges."},{"instruction":"Instructions: In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage.

Summarize this article: Women with insomnia or other sleep problems have an increased risk of giving birth prematurely, a new study suggests.      The observational study, in Obstetrics & Gynecology, included 2,172 women with a sleep disorder who gave birth between 2007 and 2012 to single children after 22 to 44 weeks of gestation. They were matched with the same number of women with the identical ethnic, health and behavioral characteristics, but who did not have a sleep disorder.      Over all, women with sleep disorders had a 14.6 percent prevalence of preterm birth (before 37 weeks of gestation), compared with 10.9 percent in those without a diagnosis. Those with insomnia had a 30 percent increased risk, and those with sleep apnea a 40 percent increased risk, compared with women without a sleep problem.      Women with insomnia were nearly twice as likely to deliver before 34 weeks gestation.      “More severe sleep disorders are often underdiagnosed, because poor sleep is common during pregnancy,” said the lead author, Jennifer N. Felder, a postdoctoral researcher in psychology at the University of California, San Francisco. “But for women having sleep problems that are severe, impairing and distressing, it’s important to talk to their health care providers.” ||||| (Reuters Health) - Women who experience sleep disorders like insomnia and apnea during pregnancy may be more likely to deliver premature babies than pregnant women who don’t have trouble sleeping, a U.S. study suggests.      Compared with women who didn’t have sleep problems, women with insomnia were 30 percent more likely to have a preemie and the odds for women with sleep apnea, a breathing disorder, were 50 percent higher, the study found.      “It is normal to experience sleep changes during pregnancy - often due to discomfort, pain or frequent trips to the bathroom,” said lead study author Jennifer Felder, of the University of California, San Francisco.      “The current study focused on more impairing sleep problems that were severe enough to result in a sleep disorder diagnosis,” Felder said by email.      Apnea, a potentially serious sleep disorder that involves repeated stops and starts in breathing, has been linked to high blood pressure during pregnancy, which is an independent risk factor for preterm births. Obesity and advanced age can make apnea more likely.      Even though many pregnant women have insomnia at some point, previous studies haven’t offered a clear picture of how this type of sleep deprivation influences the odds of preterm births.      Worldwide, preterm birth is the leading cause of death for children under 5 years old, the researchers note in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology.      Pregnancy normally lasts about 40 weeks, and babies born after 37 weeks are considered full term. The new study focused on preterm infants, delivered at 34 to 36 weeks’ gestation, and extremely premature babies delivered before 34 weeks.      In the weeks immediately after birth, preemies often have difficulty breathing and digesting food. They can also encounter longer-term challenges such as impaired vision, hearing, and cognitive skills as well as social and behavioral problems.      The study team examined data on more than 3 million births in California from 2007 to 2012. They focused on 2,172 women who had a sleep disorder diagnosis and compared their birth outcomes to a randomly selected group of 2,172 mothers who were similar in many ways but had no sleep issues.      Women with sleep disorders were more likely to be black, age 35 or older, obese, and to have other medical issues like high blood pressure, diabetes and infections as well as higher odds of smoking or using drugs and alcohol while pregnant. They were also more likely to have a history of preterm birth.      Overall, almost 15 percent of women with sleep disorders had a preterm birth, compared with 11 percent of women without sleep issues.      The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove how or even whether sleep disorders directly cause preterm births.      Even so, the results offer fresh evidence of the link between sleep disorders and early arrivals, said Dr. Ghada Bourjeily, a researcher at Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, who wasn’t involved in the study.      “Sleep appears to get worse in pregnancy in many, even women who do not have a preexisting sleep disorder,” Bourjeily said by email. “Unfortunately, we do not know yet whether improving sleep quality before or during pregnancy would prevent development of negative outcomes such as preterm birth.”      Starting pregnancy at a healthy weight, however, may make sleep disorders less likely, said Dr. Amos Grunebaum, director of obstetrics at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York.      “Being overweight or obese increases your risk of having a sleep disorder,” Grunebaum, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “It also increases pregnancy complications.”      When sleep disorders do surface during pregnancy, women should discuss symptoms in detail with their doctors, said Dr. Milena Pavlova, a researcher at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston who wasn’t involved in the study. This includes any issues with breathing, gasping or choking at night or any uncomfortable leg or body sensations that prevent sleep.      Expectant mothers should also make sleep a priority in their schedules, Pavlova, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.      “Allow enough time for sleep - the life you save may be your baby’s,” Pavlova said.      SOURCE: bit.ly/2j2fR06 Obstetrics and Gynecology, online August 8, 2017. ||||| Andrew Lichtenstein/Corbis/Getty      Despite strides in maternal medicine, premature birth remains a vexing problem for obstetricians worldwide. But an analysis of medical records from almost 3 million pregnant women in California1 suggests that a surprisingly simple intervention — better sleep — might help to address the issue.      Researchers found that women who had been diagnosed with insomnia or sleep apnoea were about twice as likely as women without sleep disorders to deliver their babies more than six weeks early.      “It seems obvious, but strangely this study has not been done before,” says Laura Jelliffe-Pawlowski, an epidemiologist at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and an author of the research, which was published on 8 August in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology1. “Seeing this relationship is important because we are just starved for interventions that can make a difference.”      Public-health experts say that better treatment for pregnant women with serious sleep disorders could save babies' lives, and do so with approaches that avoid the use of medication. Every year, 15 million babies worldwide are born prematurely — more than three weeks before the typical full-term pregnancy of 40 weeks. These children have less time to develop in the womb, and 1.1 million will die from birth-related complications. Many others are left with hearing impairment, learning disabilities, cerebral palsy and other health issues.      The new study is part of the UCSF Preterm Birth Initiative, an ambitious US100-million effort to study prematurity, focusing on California and East Africa. The researchers working on the effort plan to mine large quantities of historical data, ensuring that any findings are statistically significant. They hope to use these findings to identify medical and social interventions that could reduce preterm births, and test them in trials of pregnant women.The programme is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and philanthropists Lynne and Marc Benioff.      Forty winks for forty weeks      Jennifer Felder, a postdoctoral researcher in clinical psychology at UCSF who led the study, says that she had been troubled by the lack of research on sleep and pregnancy. Because pregnant women often have some difficulty sleeping, she suspects that doctors and researchers had not thought to examine the consequences of sleep disorders more closely.      Felder and her colleagues acquired the records of almost three million births that took place in California between 2007 and 2012, which were scrubbed of identifying information but linked to hospital-discharge papers from the women who had given birth. Each record contained a medical history of the mother and notes taken throughout her pregnancy and baby's delivery. Doctors had diagnosed about 2,300 of the women with a sleep disorder during their pregnancy. Insomnia and sleep apnoea were the main problems, although narcolepsy, excessive sleepiness and restless leg syndrome were also seen.      Insomnia, the researchers found, increased a woman's risk of preterm birth by 30%, while sleep apnoea increased the risk by 40%. Sleep disorders also increased the risk of very premature births: 5.3% of women with sleep issues delivered their babies at less than 34 weeks' pregnancy, compared to 2.9% for women without such a diagnosis.      Felder says that a lack of sleep is unlikely to be a direct cause of early births. But it could trigger other processes, such as inflammation, that eventually result in prematurity. A 2010 review of studies linked premature birth to the presence of the inflammatory proteins C-reactive protein and interleukin-6, in amniotic fluid2. To explore the idea, the UCSF initiative will soon begin to examine immune-system proteins in pregnant women using blood stored in a repository associated with California’s department of public health. The scientists will compare samples with an attention to premature birth and insomnia.      And in the meantime, sleep troubles in expectant mothers can alert doctors to potential danger. “I counsel women on how to have the best pregnancy outcome,” says Louis Muglia, the director of the Center for Prevention of Preterm Birth at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center in Ohio. “Now I might start asking, 'do you get a good night’s sleep?'.” ||||| Summary:","output":"A new study suggests that women with insomnia or other sleep problems have a higher risk of giving birth prematurely. Pregnant women with sleep disorders had a 14.6% prevalence of preterm birth (before 37 weeks of pregnancy), compared with 10.9% of women without sleep disorders. Women with insomnia had a 30% higher risk of preterm birth, while those with sleep apnea had a 40% increased risk. As poor sleep is often common during pregnancy, severe sleep disorders are often underdiagnosed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: She's the One Movie plot: The film tells the story of two Irish Catholic Fitzpatrick brothers, Mickey (Edward Burns) and Francis (Mike McGlone) and the tribulations of love, family and betrayal. Mickey is a New York City blue-collared taxi driver, unhappy over an act of infidelity committed by Heather (Cameron Diaz), his ex-fiancÃ©e. Francis is a white-collared Wall Street stock investor, who unknown to his wife, Renee (Jennifer Aniston), is having an affair. During weekends, Mickey and Francis visit their parents who live on Long Island. Their mother is never seen on screen, while they have better time interacting with their father, Frank (John Mahoney), who always gives Mickey and Francis advice to live out their lives any way they can and to always go for what drives them to succeed. While driving his cab one day, Mickey picks up Hope (Maxine Bahns), an NYU art student with whom he becomes infatuated and impulsively marries after a few days. This causes consternation for his brother, largely because he was not asked to be best man at the wedding. Mickey moves in with Hope, but later becomes disillusioned with aspects of their lifestyle, including frequent power cuts in their ramshackle apartment. Francis is also having problems in his marriage. He is concerned that he is being unfair to Heather, his mistress, the same woman Mickey left, by continuing to stay with Renee. At the same time, Renee's Italian-American family, mostly her younger sister Molly (Amanda Peet), suggest the problem with Francis' lack of interest in her is that he may be gay, so she has Mickey and their father, Frank, confront him about it. He denies being gay, but admits to being unfaithful. Meanwhile, Francis' arrogance leads him to take potshots at his brother for the apparent lack of forward progression in his life with his wife, while Francis argues with Heather about her own sexual infidelity with a much older man referred to as \\"Papa\\". One day, Mickey picks up Heather in his cab and goes up to her apartment to retrieve a television that belonged to him... My question: Who does Mickey pick up? The answer to this question is:","output":"Mickey picks up Hope (Maxine Bahns), an NYU art student with whom he becomes infatuated and impulsively marries after a few days."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is five miles long by half a mile wide (8 km by 800 m), has a maximum depth of 184 feet (56 m), and covers an area of 1.89 sqmi . The lake has an elevation of 143 feet (44 m) above sea level. It drains to the sea via the River Crake. Can we infer the following? Coniston Water in Cumbria is the largest lake in the English Lake District","output":"No, we cannot infer that Coniston Water in Cumbria is the largest lake in the English Lake District based on the information provided. While it is mentioned that Coniston Water is the third largest lake in the area, we don't have enough information about the other lakes in the Lake District to claim that it is the largest. The Lake District, located in the county of Cumbria, is a popular tourist destination in England and is known for its stunning glacial lakes, picturesque landscapes, and challenging hikes. The area comprises a total of sixteen main lakes, each varying in size, depth, and character. Regarding the sizes of the lakes within the Lake District, Windermere is the largest, followed by Ullswater and then Coniston Water. Windermere, the largest lake, is approximately 11 miles (17.7 km) long, 0.7 miles (1.1 km) wide, and has a maximum depth of 219 feet (67 m), covering an area of 5.69 sq mi (14.73 sq km). In comparison, Coniston Water—the third largest lake—is only 5 miles (8 km) long, 0.5 miles (0.8 km) wide, and has a maximum depth of 184 feet (56 m), with an area of 1.89 sq mi (4.9 sq km). As shown in the comparison above, Coniston Water is significantly smaller than Windermere in terms of size, width, depth, and overall area. Therefore, we can conclude that Coniston Water is not the largest lake in the English Lake District, but rather the third largest. Windermere is the largest lake, followed by Ullswater in second place and Coniston Water in third. Each lake in the Lake District offers unique recreational, historical, and wildlife attributes that make them attractive destinations for visitors. However, Coniston Water is particularly famous for its role in the development of several speed records set by Sir Malcolm Campbell, Donald Campbell, and others. In addition, the region's picturesque views, as immortalized by John Ruskin, make it a popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts and explorers."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Background: Born in Scotland on 15 June 1792, he was son of John Mitchell of Carron Works and was brought up from childhood by his uncle, Thomas Livingstone of Parkhall, Stirlingshire. On the death of his uncle, he joined the British army in Portugal as a volunteer, at the age of sixteen. On 24 June 1811, at the age of nineteen, he received his first commission as 2nd Lieutenant in the 1st Battalion 95th Rifles (later the Rifle Brigade / Royal Green Jackets). Utilising his skills as a draughtsman of outstanding ability, he was occasionally employed in the Quartermaster-General's department under Sir George Murray. Context: In 1831 a runaway convict named George Clarke, who had lived with Aborigines in the area for several years, claimed that a large river called Kindur flowed north-west from the Liverpool ranges in New South Wales to the sea. Charles Sturt believed that the Murray-Darling system formed the main river system of New South Wales and Mitchell wanted to prove Sturt wrong. Mitchell formed an expedition consisting of himself, assistant surveyor George Boyle White and 15 convicts who were promised remission for good conduct. Mitchell took 20 bullocks, three heavy drays, three light carts and nine horses to carry supplies, and set out on 24 November 1831 to investigate the claim. On reaching Wollombi in the Hunter Valley, the local assistant surveyor, Heneage Finch, expressed a desire to join the expedition. He had established his credentials by surveying a route from Sydney to Wollombi, so Mitchell approved his request, provided he obtained extra supplies and men, and he followed along later.  The expedition continued northward, climbed the Liverpool Range on 5 December, and made Quirindi on 8 December. Shortly afterwards Finch arrived but inexplicably had not brought provisions, so Mitchell immediately sent him back to get them. By 11 December the expedition had reached Wallamoul Station near Tamworth, the northern extent of white settlement at the time.  Mitchell continued his northward push into new territory, taking local Kamilaroi people to assist in finding water and to express his peaceful intentions. By early January 1832 he was in the vicinity of the present town of Narrabri, reached the Gwydir River in mid-January, and found the Barwon by the end of the month, where he set up camp. Mitchell left the main party and made a reconnaissance down the Barwon until he found its junction with the Gwydir. After Mitchell returned to the main camp, Finch arrived with tragic news. He had been travelling with three convicts and provisions but, because of a shortage of water, the group had separated. He left two men behind while he attempted to locate the main expedition. Having failed to do that, on the second day he returned to the campsite to discover that it had been ransacked. Supplies were scattered and beneath the wreckage were two dead men. The immediate effect was that Mitchell decided to abandon the expedition and return south. The party reached the Gwydir on 8 February and was near the site of the attack on 17 February. Mitchell buried the two bodies and salvaged some equipment. Once back at Wallamoul, Mitchell placed White in charge of the main party, while he returned hastily to Sydney. He was satisfied that there was no truth about the river Kindur claimed by Clarke. Fourteen years after the attack, Mitchell revealed that the convicts had indulged in sexual relations with Aboriginal women. Question: What happened in the attack? Answer:","output":"In the attack, two men from Mitchell's expedition were killed. The incident occurred when Heneage Finch, who had been traveling with three convicts and provisions, faced a water shortage and the group had to separate.

While in Hamburg they received an anonymous telegram stating: \\"Do not go to Tokyo. Your life is in danger.\\" The threat was taken seriously in light of the controversy surrounding the tour among Japan's religious and conservative groups, with particular opposition to the Beatles' planned performances at the sacred Nippon Budokan arena. As an added precaution, 35,000 police were mobilised and tasked with protecting the group, who were transported from hotels to concert venues in armoured vehicles. The Beatles then performed in the Philippines, where they were threatened and manhandled by its citizens for not visiting First Lady Imelda Marcos. The group were angry with their manager, Brian Epstein, for insisting on what they regarded as an exhausting and demoralising itinerary. The publication in the US of Lennon's remarks about the Beatles being \\"more popular than Jesus\\" then embroiled the band in controversy and protest in America's Bible Belt. A public apology eased tensions, but a US tour in August that was marked by reduced ticket sales, relative to the group's record attendances in 1965, and subpar performances proved to be their last. The author Nicholas Schaffner writes: To the Beatles, playing such concerts had become a charade so remote from the new directions they were pursuing that not a single tune was attempted from the just-released Revolver LP, whose arrangements were for the most part impossible to reproduce with the limitations imposed by their two-guitars-bass-and-drums stage lineup.

The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the FrenchItalian border, and at is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4000 metres (just over 13,000 feet).  - Liptov is a historical and geographical region in northern Slovakia with around 140,000 inhabitants.

The idea of spending two months in Argentine was exciting. Then I began having second thoughts. I had never been far from New England, and I had been homesick my first few weeks at college. What would it be like in a strange country? What about the language? The more I thought about it, the more the idea worried me.  In the end I turned down the invitation. As soon as Ted asked somebody else to go, I began kicking myself. I had turned down something I wanted to do because I was scared, and had ended up feeling depressed. That unhappy summer taught me a valuable lesson out of which I developed a rule for myself: do what makes you anxious; don't do what makes you depressed.  At the end of my senior year, I began to think about becoming a writer. But my professor was urging me to aim at teaching. I hesitated. The idea of trying to live by writing was a lot scarier than spending a summer in Argentina. Back and forth I went, making my decision, unmaking it. Suddenly I realized that every time I gave up the idea of writing, that downhearted feeling went through me. Giving up on what I really wanted to do depressed me. Right then I learned another lesson. To avoid that kind of depression meant having to bear a certain amount of worry and concern. When I first began writing articles, I was frequently required to interview big names. Before each interview I would get butterflies in the stomach and my hands would shake. One person I particularly admired was the great composer Duke Ellington. On the stage and on television, he seemed the very model of confidence. Then I learned Ellington still got stage fright. If the highly honored Ellington, who had appeared on the bandstand some 10,000 times over 30years, had anxiety attacks, who was I to think I could avoid them? I went on doing those frightening interviews. Then I realized to my astonishment that I was even looking forward to the interviews.... Which of the following opinions does the author probably accept? A) Hesitation leads to depression. B) Anxiety can be a positive drive C) Avoiding anxiety reduces depression. D) Depression is a signal that one is growing up. A:","output":"B) Anxiety can be a positive drive"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Choose the next sentence.New York (CNN) -- The WTC Captive Insurance Co. announced settlements Thursday with more than 10,000 plaintiffs who claimed sickness or injuries after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The settlements could total up to 657 million. WTC Captive was created with a 1 billion FEMA grant and provides insurance coverage to the City of New York and its debris-removal contractors. In the aftermath of attacks of September 11, 2001, New York was unable to get adequate amounts of liability insurance for the rescue, recovery and debris-removal work done at the World Trade Center site. The settlement would provide a system to pay for the compensation of the injury claims made by people working on the rescue and debris removal for the city and its contractors. This would include construction workers, firefighters, police officers and other workers and volunteers. The settlement would also fund a special insurance policy, which provides additional compensation to any plaintiff contracting certain types of cancer in the future. Since September 11th, the city has moved aggressively to provide medical treatment to those who were present at OPTIONS: - CNN, and we will continue our commitment to treatment and monitoring.\\" - City of New York, and we will continue our commitment to treatment and monitoring.\\" - FEMA, and we will continue our commitment to treatment and monitoring.\\" - New York, and we will continue our commitment to treatment and monitoring.\\" - WTC Captive, and we will continue our commitment to treatment and monitoring.\\" - WTC Captive Insurance Co., and we will continue our commitment to treatment and monitoring.\\" - World Trade Center site, and we will continue our commitment to treatment and monitoring.\\"","output":"\\"the World Trade Center site, and we will continue our commitment to treatment and monitoring.\\" This next sentence is an appropriate continuation of the information provided in the given text. It logically pushes the narrative forward, underscoring the continued commitment of the City of New York and other involved organizations to the care and monitoring of those affected by the tragic events of September 11th, 2001.  This sentence emphasizes the ongoing responsibility and active measures that the city and the organizations involved, such as the WTC Captive Insurance Co., have towards the rescue and recovery workers. They've shown commitment to ensuring that those who gave their service at a time of national crisis receive comprehensive medical treatment and monitoring. This is especially crucial because, according to the article, several workers have claimed sickness or injuries after the terrorist attacks, adding another dimension to the total impact of the event. Also, it would be important to note that the phrase \\"those who were present at the World Trade Center site\\" includes not only the first-responders and workers who were involved in the rescue, recovery, and debris removal operations but also other individuals who were at the site for various reasons. This includes office workers, bystanders, and residents in the surrounding area who also might have been exposed to harmful substances or experienced traumatic events due to the attacks. By continuing a commitment to treatment and monitoring, the organizations involved show recognition for the broad range of people affected by the events of 9/11. Furthermore, this statement reassures that they are not only addressing immediate issues but are also ready to handle any consequent health challenges. The mention of a special insurance policy, which provides additional compensation to any plaintiff contracting certain types of cancer in the future, is significant in demonstrating this long-term commitment. Overall, the selected sentence provides a solid connection between the past commitments and future intentions of the city and the organizations in dealing with the aftermath of September 11th, tying together the narrative provided in the news story while also hinting at the wider implications of the event."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

However, the premise is a recommendation to take action, while the hypothesis considers the possibility of taking action. In this case, as the hypothesis contemplates trying the parlors of the red lotus, which is in line with the recommendation in the premise, we can assume that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis.

Undefeated in battle, Alexander had conquered the Persian Empire in its entirety by 330 BC. By the time of his death in 323 BC, he had created one of the largest empires in history, stretching from Greece to India. His empire split into several kingdoms upon his death, the most famous of which were the Seleucid Empire, Ptolemaic Egypt, the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and the Indo-Greek Kingdom. Many Greeks migrated to Alexandria, Antioch, Seleucia and the many other new Hellenistic cities in Asia and Africa. Although the political unity of Alexander's empire could not be maintained, it resulted in the Hellenistic civilization and spread the Greek language and Greek culture in the territories conquered by Alexander.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Light a fire in a fire pit, barrel or campfire location. If your fire is on or in the ground, clear brush and debris from the site. Choose a spot that is downwind and is at least 15 feet from your belongings.  Make sure there is water and a fire extinguisher nearby so that you can douse a runaway fire. Don't build a signal fire unless you are actually in need of help! Gather dried out fallen tree limbs and dry twigs. You will want larger logs and branches for fuel, large twigs for kindling, and small twigs for tinder. Gather dead wood that is thoroughly dry. Tinder can also be made of wadded up paper, bits of wax, strips of cardboard, or wood shavings. For wet foliage, gather leaves, weeds, and grass. If they are not damp, pour a few cups of water along them. Loosely pile the fuel logs at the bottom of your firepit. Stack kindling on top in a tipi, cross, or square \\"cabin\\" shape. Don't pack too much in—there should be air between the branches. Add kindling to the top and light with a match or lighter.  Add more tinder as the fire goes. Blow gently at the base of the fire to encourage it. When you have strong fire, you can add more kindling or fuel to keep it going. Once your fire has been going for a while, and shows no sign of stopping, dump the wet foliage on it. Step back several feet and admire the results: a tall plume of billowing white smoke.  If you do this in a remote location, you may attract rescuers. Alternatively, add a paper bag of wet straw. You'll get a smaller but longer-lasting plume. Douse the fire thoroughly with water when you are done. Check on it after the steam clears to make sure it isn't still burning, sparking, or smoking.

(CNN) -- Women seeking an abortion in Texas will have to view a picture of the embryo or fetus and hear a description of its development before having the procedure, under a law that takes effect September 1. The bill stirred some controversy in Texas, but it easily passed through the state House and Senate, both of which are controlled by Republicans. It was signed into law Thursday by Republican Gov. Rick Perry. The law says that at least 24 hours before an abortion is performed, women must undergo a sonogram, a procedure that uses ultrasound to create an image. The doctor, then, is required to give, \\"in a manner understandable to a layperson, a verbal explanation of the results of the sonogram images, including a medical description of the dimensions of the embryo or fetus, the presence of cardiac activity, and the presence of external members and internal organs,\\" the law states. There are some exceptions, including pregnancies that resulted from sexual assault, incest or other violations of law. Women seeking abortions also are exempt if the fetus has been found to have an irreversible medical condition that will cause a disability. \\"Governor Perry was pleased to sign this important legislation, which bolsters our efforts to protect life by ensuring Texans are fully informed when considering such an important decision,\\" said his deputy press secretary, Lucy Nashed. Critics say the new law is unnecessary. \\"What no one is focusing on is that this is a mandate to humiliate women who want an abortion,\\" said Yvonne Gutierrez, vice president for public affairs at the Planned Parenthood Trust of South Texas. Texas already requires a 24-hour consent period, and the new law will simply add emotional and financial costs to those seeking abortions, she said.  Question: \\"Why do critics feel the law is unnecessary?\\" Answer: \\"They would argue that there is already a law in place for a 24 hour consent period\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"Yes, the answer to the question is correct. Critics feel the law is unnecessary because there is already a 24-hour consent period in place, and they believe the new law will simply add emotional and financial costs to those seeking abortions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given those answer options, answer the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   The mouth of a sea anemone is surrounded by tentacles that bear cnidocytes. The slit-like mouth opening and pharynx are lined by a groove called a siphonophore. The pharynx is the muscular part of the digestive system that serves to ingest as well as egest food, and may extend for up to two-thirds the length of the body before opening into the gastrovascular cavity. This cavity is divided into several chambers by longitudinal septa called mesenteries. Each mesentery consists of one ectodermal and one endodermal cell layer with the mesoglea sandwiched in between. Mesenteries do not divide the gastrovascular cavity completely, and the smaller cavities coalesce at the pharyngeal opening. The adaptive benefit of the mesenteries appears to be an increase in surface area for absorption of nutrients and gas exchange. Sea anemones feed on small fish and shrimp, usually by immobilizing their prey using the cnidocytes. Some sea anemones establish a mutualistic relationship with hermit crabs by attaching to the crab’s shell. In this relationship, the anemone gets food particles from prey caught by the crab, and the crab is protected from the predators by the stinging cells of the anemone. Anemone fish, or clownfish, are able to live in the anemone since they are immune to the toxins contained within the nematocysts. Anthozoans remain polypoid throughout their lives and can reproduce asexually by budding or fragmentation, or sexually by producing gametes. Both gametes are produced by the polyp, which can fuse to give rise to a free-swimming planula larva. The larva settles on a suitable substratum and develops into a sessile polyp.   Q: Some sea anemones establish what kind of relationship with hermit crabs by attaching to the crab’s shell?   A: A:","output":"Some sea anemones establish a mutualistic relationship with hermit crabs by attaching to the crab's shell. In this type of relationship, both the sea anemone and the hermit crab benefit from each other's presence. The anemone gets food particles from prey caught by the crab, while the crab is protected from predators by the stinging cells (cnidocytes) of the anemone. Mutualistic relationships are characterized by the interaction between two different species where both organisms benefit from the association, enhancing their overall survival and fitness. This type of symbiotic relationship can be found in several ecosystems, and the example of sea anemones and hermit crabs demonstrates how organisms can coexist and thrive together, exploiting their respective strengths to benefit one another."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Joules 5. red blood cells 6. plasma 7. Energy 8. Energy Fact 1 clearly states that insulin assists cells in taking up glucose from the blood. Glucose, as mentioned in Fact 2, is a sugar. Hence, we can deduce that insulin helps in the uptake of sugar from the blood. So, the correct answer is: 3. sugar To further elaborate, insulin is a hormone that is produced by the pancreas. Its primary function is to regulate the amount of glucose in the bloodstream by promoting the uptake of glucose by cells, particularly in muscles, fat tissues, and the liver. This allows the body to use glucose as a primary source of energy, ensuring that the glucose levels in the blood are maintained within a healthy range. When there is a dysfunction in insulin production or its ability to facilitate glucose uptake, this can lead to health issues, such as diabetes.

You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task. In this task, you are given a review of movie. Your task is to classify given movie review into two categories: 1) positive, and 2) negative based on its content. With a title like that, it's above and beyond my comprehension how this movie just did NOT appeal to me. Granted, there's a few decently sleazy moments and a little gore, but the way in which the movie was shot and the overall storyline just struck me as an idiotic and lazy attempt at profuse \\"shock\\" tactics... The inconsistent plot starts with a guy raping and murdering a woman stranded at the side of the road. He and his abetting brother are imprisoned up until the brother breaks out and arranges to meet his girlfriend out in the woods. He ends up forcing her into a house where they screw and he later shows her a collection of kidnapped guys in the basement. The heavily drugged captives consist of her old boyfriend who raped her, a \\"grabby\\" neighbor, and her sexually abrasive boss. He explains to her that he is going to kill them all. She winds up killing HIM and then turning her focus towards the men (or pigs) whom she tortures and kills, herself... Most of the violence and humiliation has to do with sh!t eating and genitalia destroying - all of which are far from disturbing and essentially mild. The best scene is a graphic broom handle masturbation followed by some painful man-rape... Surely, \\"I Spit on Your Corpse, I P!ss on Your Grave\\" was intended as an unofficial sequel to \\"I Spit on Your Grave\\" - based on, mainly the title, and a reference the main character gives - suggesting her mother was Camille Keaton. I personally consider that to be a wildly blasphemous assertion! This movie is a boring, amateurish mess that strives for shocks but failed miserably...

He became interested in the idea of sanitation  after taking part in a research project on the social and political development of cities, One of the most common problems he found in developing countries was the lack of toilets, He wanted to do something to help, So working with others, he started the project in 2005, and the next year started a company called Peepoolple. The toilet is a single--use bag made of environmentally friendly plastics, The inside is treated with urea  , a chemical commonly used as fertilizer, The hotter the weather, the more quickly the waste turns into what is needed by plants The sanitation process can be as soon as a couple of hours or as long as two to four weeks ,You can just bury it in a pot and grow whatever you like. The company expects to start selling the bags in August in Kenya and Bangladesh, But it is just beginning production and sales in Nairobi now, Full production could reach about half a million bags a day and people may be able to buy the pee-pool in countries Vietnam, Bangladesh, etc. The United Nations says more than two and a half billion people around the world do not have good sanitation .Many have no choice but to use the outdoors, which is not only bad for the environment ,but also harmful to people's health, Each year, poor sanitation leads to three fifths of those people getting an infectious disease which on average causes one out of 1,000 patients to die.

Combine these terms by adding them: (110 + 931) * a = 1041 * a Now, our equation looks like this: 1041 * a = -124 * a + 118830 Step 2: Move the -124 * a term to the left side of the equation To do this, we need to add 124 * a to both sides of the equation: (1041 * a) + (124 * a) = 118830 (1041 + 124) * a = 1165 * a Now, our equation looks like this: 1165 * a = 118830 Step 3: Solve for 'a' Now that we have the equation in simplified form, it's time to solve for 'a'.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Bloc Party are an English rock band, currently composed of Kele Okereke (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, keyboards, sampler), Russell Lissack (lead guitar, keyboards), Justin Harris (bass guitar, keyboards, saxophones, backing vocals) and Louise Bartle (drums, percussion). Former members Matt Tong and Gordon Moakes left the band in 2013 and 2015 respectively. Their brand of music, whilst rooted in rock, retains elements of other genres such as electronica and house music. The band was formed at the 1999 Reading Festival by Okereke and Lissack. Bloc Party's second album, A Weekend in the City, was produced by Garret \\"Jacknife\\" Lee. It was released in February 2007, although it was leaked in November 2006. It became available for download on the UK iTunes Store before the physical release, and reached the number 2 spot on the UK Albums Chart. The album also reached number 2 on the Australian and Belgian charts, and debuted at number 12 in the Billboard 200, with 48,000 copies sold. The first single, \\"The Prayer\\", was released on 29 January, and became the band's highest charting single in the British Top 40, reaching number 4. In the buildup to the release of the album, BBC Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe aired a live set by the band from Maida Vale studios on 30 January 2007, featuring a mix of old and new songs. On 1 February 2007, A Weekend in the City was made available to listen to for free through Bloc Party's official MySpace page.  The next single, \\"I Still Remember\\", was Bloc Party's highest charting American single, peaking at number 24 on the Modern Rock Chart. The band released their third single, \\"Hunting for Witches\\", with an accompanying video clip in August 2007. The single became their only ARIA Chart entry, peaking at number 20. In October 2007, it was announced that Bloc Party would release a new single, \\"Flux\\", on 13 November--ahead of their end of year gigs. The electronic song, also produced by Jacknife Lee, was very different from previous singles released by the band.  The band's first gig following the release of A Weekend in the City was on 5 February 2007, in Reading, and was broadcast live on BBC 6 Music. On 20 May 2007, Bloc Party headlined on the In New Music We Trust stage at the BBC Radio 1 Big Weekend in Preston. They also performed at the UK leg of Live Earth on 7 July 2007 at Wembley Stadium. Furthermore, the band played sets at T in the Park and Oxegen 07 that same weekend, as well as Glastonbury and the Reading and Leeds Festivals later in 2007. Bloc Party announced a tour of Australia and New Zealand in August 2007, which would include a special appearance at the Splendour in the Grass Festival on 5 August. On 17 September 2007, they recorded a set for the PBS show Austin City Limits a day after playing at the Austin City Limits Music Festival. On 27 October, the band performed a set at London's The Roundhouse with the Exmoor Singers, a London-based choir, as part of the BBC Electric Proms.

Ice cream shop A:","output":"Title: \\"Scoop of Destiny\\" Genre: Action, Comedy, Mystery Plot: John Smith, a retired ex-CIA agent, has been leading an ordinary life as an ice cream truck driver since his wife, Sarah, was killed in a tragic accident. One hot day, Smith stops at the local ice cream shop \\"Sweet Escape,\\" as requested by a group of enthusiastic kids from the nearby playground. As Smith scoops up their orders, a young woman named Emma, who works at the shop, mysteriously hands him a coded message inside an ice cream cone. It's a message from an unknown informant simply known as \\"The Scoop.\\" Emma soon reveals herself as a fellow ex-spy, who was sent by The Scoop to enlist Smith's help in preventing a catastrophic global event. According to The Scoop's message, an enigmatic organization called \\"Cone of Silence\\" has infiltrated the US government and plans to unleash a deadly virus through popular ice cream brands. They hope to hold the world hostage by monopolizing the cure, which can only be planted in their own homemade ice cream. Smith must come out of retirement and put aside his grief for Sarah as he and Emma race against time to find doses of the cure and recover the virus sample before it goes public. Along the way, they discover signs that point back to a deeper connection between the death of Smith's wife and the founding of Cone of Silence. Together, Smith and Emma reunite with a quirky group of fellow ex-spies, locate secret laboratories, and investigate ice cream factories all over the world. All the while, they try to decipher the enigmatic clues left by The Scoop who remains one step ahead of them. With each new discovery, they start to unravel the hidden agenda of the Cone of Silence and its ultimate goal to change the balance of power in the world. During their adventure, Smith and Emma develop a unique bond, united by their shared past in the world of espionage and the common goal of saving mankind. Their relationship becomes a source of strength, laughter, and eventual romantic interest, as they fight to prevent the impending doom. In a climactic finale, Smith and Emma confront the Cone of Silence's leader, who reveals himself as none other than Sarah's brother - a rogue CIA agent presumed dead. He confesses to orchestrating her death as a means to separate John from his past life and to prevent him from digging further into dark governmental secrets.  In a last desperate attempt, John sacrifices himself to save the world and bring retribution to the people responsible for his wife's death. Moments before his demise, Emma saves his life and, with the help of their ex-spy \\"family,\\" they apprehend the Cone of Silence's leader. The virus sample is destroyed, the cure is distributed across the globe, and the world is saved. As the dust settles, Emma takes over the Sweet Escape ice cream shop as its owner, and John joins her in retirement. The duo gladly leaves their past life of espionage behind to scoop ice cream and build a new purpose-driven life together. The memory of Sarah and The Scoop's teachings remain with them, guiding them to cherish the true sweetness of life - love, laughter, and ice cream."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Kaneda and capa  for the following movie plot:  In 2057, the sun is dying and the Earth is freezing. A crew of eight pilot a colossal nuclear bomb aboard the spaceship Icarus II, with the intent to jump start the sun, and return to Earth. As they pass Mercury's orbit, Icarus II discovers the distress beacon of Icarus I, the first ship to attempt their mission, which disappeared seven years earlier. Reasoning that two bombs have a better chance of success than one, physicist Capa recommends Captain Kaneda change course and commandeer Icarus I. Mace, the ship's engineer, opposes the deviation as risky. Navigator Trey calculates a trajectory to intercept Icarus I, but forgets to realign the shields that protect the ship from the sun, causing damage to several shield panels. Kaneda and Capa embark on a spacewalk to make repairs, assisted by Pilot Cassie, who angles the damaged portion of the shield away from the sun. The angle however allows the sun to destroys the ship's oxygen garden and oxygen reserves. As Icarus II's autopilot returns the shield to its original alignment, Kaneda orders Capa to safety and repairs the last panel, moments before he's immolated. Trey blames himself for the loss of Kaneda, and psychiatrist Searle assesses him as a suicide risk, sedating him. Icarus II docks with Icarus I. Capa, Searle, Mace, and now-Captain Harvey search the vessel, leaving Cassie and botanist Corazon on board Icarus II. They discover Icarus I's mainframe has been sabotaged, making its bomb delivery impossible. In the ship's log is a rambling message from Captain Pinbacker, who abandoned his mission. The crew of Icarus I is found charred to death in the solar observation room, where they were long ago exposed to the un-shielded sun. Suddenly, the two ships explosively decouple, destroying Icarus I's outer airlock, stranding the four crew members on it. Mace suggests one crew member stay behind to manually operate the airlock while the other three jettison between airlocks, using the vacuum release for propulsion. Searle volunteers to stay behind. Capa is sealed...

Traditionally, historians have believed that the Dorian invasion caused the collapse of the Mycenaean civilization, but it is likely the main attack was made by seafaring raiders (sea peoples) who sailed into the eastern Mediterranean around 1180 BC.

Article: Memory is the ability to keep track of things that have happened in the past. Memory really is learning. One needs memory to ride a bicycle. A dog needs to remember if it is to come when called. Memory is said to be stored in the brain as a \\"memory trace .\\" What makes up this trace is not known. Some scientists believe that certain chemical substances may carry certain memories. For example, one substance, when given to rats, causes them to fear the dark. Other research into memory has to do with how the brain works. Psychologists use three means to find out how a person remembers. For example, give a person a grocery list. Let the person memorize the list, then put it away. The most natural way to find out how much a person remembers of the grocery list is to ask what he or she remembers. This is called the method of recall. Another method is called recognition. Give the person another grocery list. Ask him or her to choose items on the first list from the items that are on only the second list. Often a person will be able to recognize things that he or she cannot recall. A third method of finding how much a person remembers is called relearning. Here the person is asked to read over the first list. The person will probably learn the list the second time faster than he did the first time. The difference in the time it takes to relearn the list is thought of as a measure of how much a person has remembered. One way of remembering something is to repeat it many times. Interest is very important. Boring lists of facts are much more difficult to remember than something that we understand and are interested in. Motivation, or wanting to do something, is also important. Motivation is linked with reward. For example, a hungry animal quickly learns how to do something if that action gets the animal food. In humans, wanting to learn is often motivation. The praise of a teacher or the knowledge that an answer is correct is rewarding. Question: A good way to train an animal to do something quickly is to   _  . Options: A: make the action easy B: praise it in words C: reward it with food D: weaken its motivation A:","output":"reward it with food"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Concurrently with designing churches and building railways, Sharpe was heavily involved in the civic life of Lancaster, particularly in pioneering sanitary reform.  By political persuasion he was a Conservative, and in 1837 he joined the local Heart of Oak Club, the core of the Lancaster Conservative Association. He was elected a town councillor for Castle Ward in 1841, a post he held for ten years, and in 1843 was appointed the town council's representative on the local Police Commission.  He was also a visitor to the national schools, and in November 1848 he was elected as mayor for year, at that time a position more like that of a \\"chief magistrate\\". Through these offices he became aware of the unsatisfactory state of sanitation in the town, and resolved to improve it. The town was overcrowded, it suffered from poor housing, open sewers, overflowing cesspits, and a very poor water supply, mainly from wells polluted by infiltration.  Many people suffered from typhus, and in 1848 there was an outbreak of cholera. The Police Commission had been established in Lancaster in 1825 with a wider role than suggested by its title, including \\"cleansing, lighting and watching\\" the town. However, there was constant friction between the Police Commission and the Town Council, the former tending to block any necessary reforms on the grounds of cost to the ratepayers.  The conflict was unresolved until the two bodies merged in 1849. The functions of the new body included the establishment of the first Lancaster Board of Health.

Since Versailles is a television series, it is structured to keep the audience engaged with multiple episodes that make up the storyline. Generally, television series have more than one episode to explore a narrative fully, delve into character development, and create a cohesive story arc. In the case of Versailles, the series consists of three seasons with a total of 30 episodes.  The show is a historical fiction drama that draws narrative elements from real-life historical events, while integrating fictional components and creative liberties typical to the genre. Versailles' episodes maintain the audience's interest by providing a blend of history, political intrigue, personal relationships, and court pageantry, all set in one of the most opulent palaces ever built.

The stadium's roof developed a 1,000 square meter hole after a barrage of snow over Christmas. Additionally, three fibreglass strips responsible for holding the roof in place have been destroyed. Concerning the biathlon, Schalke's chairman Peter Peters stated that the holes would not be fixed in time and prioritized the safety of the spectators. The Bundesliga is on its winter break, with Schalke's next scheduled home game against Hamburg on January 15. Despite the damage, this match is not expected to be affected, as it can proceed with an open roof. Peters expressed optimism that the second half of the season will commence as planned.  It is worth noting that staff members had cleared an earlier snowfall before Christmas but couldn't access the roof afterwards due to the severity of the weather conditions. The Veltins Arena was inaugurated in 2001, and it can accommodate up to 61,482 spectators. In its history, the stadium has witnessed prestigious events, such as the UEFA Champions League final in 2004 and hosting five matches during the 2006 World Cup."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Movie title: Man on the Moon Movie plot: At the beginning, Kaufman's foreign man comes on saying (due to massive editing) it is the end of the film and plays a record alongside the end credits before walking off. Kaufman then comes back on in his normal voice saying he \\"Had to get rid of the people who don't understand me, and don't want to try\\". He then proceeds to show the actual movie on a film projector starting with his childhood home, in Long Island, New York 1957.Flashing forwards to New York City, 1973, Andy Kaufman (Jim Carrey) is a struggling performer whose act fails in nightclubs because, while the audience wants comedy, he sings childrens songs and overuses his \\"foreign man\\" character. Just as it becomes clear that Kaufman may have no real talent, he puts on a rhinestone jacket and does a dead-on Elvis impersonation and song. The audience bursts into applause, realizing Kaufman had tricked them making his big Elvis payoff all the more enjoyable. This is the first of many times we see Kaufman trick the audience, as \\"fooling the audience\\" is his performance style.His autistic, eccentric style catches the eye of talent agent George Shapiro (Danny DeVito), who signs him as a client and immediately gets Kaufman on a new sitcom, 'Taxi' in 1975, much to the dismay of sitcom-hating Kaufman. Because of the money, visibility, and chance to do his own television special, Kaufman acts on Taxi, but secretly hates it and works a second menial job as a restaurant busboy. Around this time, he gains popularity by making successful guest appearances on the new show 'Saturday Night Live'.At a nightclub, Shapiro witnesses a performance from a rude, loud-mouthed lounge singer named Tony Clifton, whom Andy wants to guest-star several times on Taxi on his terms, and whose bad attitude is matched by his horrible appearance and demeanor. When Clifton meets Shapiro privately, Clifton takes off his sunglasses and we see that he is actually Kaufman. Clifton is a villain character created by Kaufman and his creative partner, Bob Zmuda (Paul Giamatti), both of whom...

Create a 2D array (matrix) to store the lengths of common subsequences. 2. Initialize the first row and first column of the matrix to 0. 3. Iterate through the matrix, comparing elements from the two lists. 4. If the elements match, update the matrix with the value of the previous diagonal element plus 1. 5. If the elements don't match, update the matrix with the maximum of the value above the current cell or the value to the left of the current cell. 6. After iterating through the entire matrix, the longest common subsequence length will be in the bottom-right corner. 7. Reconstruct the longest common subsequence using the populated matrix. Now, let's execute the steps: Step 1: Create a 2D array (matrix) to store the lengths of common subsequences. First, I will find the length of list A and list B. len(A) = 20 len(B) = 23 Next, I will create a matrix of size (len(A) + 1) x (len(B) + 1). lcs_matrix = [[0 for _ in range(len(B) + 1)] for _ in range(len(A) + 1)] Step 2: Initialize the first row and first column of the matrix to 0. This step is already done since we initialized all elements to 0 when we created the matrix. Step 3: Iterate through the matrix, comparing elements from the two lists. for i in range(1, len(A) + 1):     for j in range(1, len(B) + 1):         # Compare elements from the two lists         if A[i - 1] == B[j - 1]:             # Step 4: If the elements match, update the matrix with the value             # of the previous diagonal element plus 1.             lcs_matrix[i][j] = lcs_matrix[i - 1][j - 1] + 1         else:             # Step 5: If the elements don't match, update the matrix with the             # maximum of the value above the current cell or the value to the             # left of the current cell.             lcs_matrix[i][j] = max(lcs_matrix[i - 1][j], lcs_matrix[i][j - 1]) Step 6: After iterating through the entire matrix, the longest common subsequence length will be in the bottom-right corner. lcs_length = lcs_matrix[len(A)][len(B)] Step 7: Reconstruct the longest common subsequence using the populated matrix. To reconstruct the longest common subsequence, I will iterate through the matrix in reverse, starting from the bottom-right corner and moving diagonally up and left. If an element has a higher value than its left neighbor and upper neighbor, it is part of the longest common subsequence, so I will add it to the result and continue moving diagonally up and left. Otherwise, I will move up or left based on which neighboring value is higher. Here's how I will reconstruct the longest common subsequence: lcs = [] i = len(A) j = len(B) while i > 0 and j > 0:     if lcs_matrix[i][j] > lcs_matrix[i - 1][j] and lcs_matrix[i][j] > lcs_matrix[i][j - 1]:         lcs.append(A[i - 1])         i -= 1         j -= 1     elif lcs_matrix[i - 1][j] > lcs_matrix[i][j - 1]:         i -= 1     else:         j -= 1 Finally, I will reverse the lcs list to get the correct order of the longest common subsequence and return it: lcs.reverse() Longest Common Subsequence: ['6301', 'T', 'h', '8065', '747', '8569', '9447', 'L', '3741', 'P']"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Harris Allsworth (David Gurian) is their manager and Kelly's boyfriend. At the beginning of the film, Kelly gets the idea to relocate to the West Coast and look up her estranged Aunt Susan. It seems that Aunt Susan (Phyllis Davis) is holding a large inheritance that would have been shared with Kelly's mother, had she been alive. Kelly feels as if a share of this money could be hers, so the foursome sets out for Hollywood.Aunt Susan welcomes Kelly and her friends, and even promises a third of the fortune to Kelly, but Susan's sleazy financial advisor Porter Hall looks down on the girls, deeming them \\"hippies\\". Meanwhile, Susan introduces The Kelly Affair to a flamboyant and well-connected rock producer named Ronnie \\"Z-Man\\" Barzell (John LaZar), who urges the girls to give an impromptu performance at one of his outrageous parties. The number goes over so well that Z-Man takes the band under his wing, changing their name to The Carrie Nations, much to the chagrin of Harris.

In the movie, the three young women – Kelly, Casey, and Petronella – form a rock trio called The Kelly Affair, managed by Harris, who is also Kelly's boyfriend. As the plot progresses, their relationships become more complicated which brings forth various challenges that affect both their careers and personal lives.  Kelly's estranged Aunt Susan offers her a share of inheritance, which leads to tensions with her financial advisor, Porter Hall. Furthermore, Kelly's involvement with the opportunistic gigolo, Lance Rocke, not only strains her relationship with her boyfriend Harris but also results in increased inheritance demands that could further complicate her relationship with her aunt and Porter Hall. The rift between Kelly and Harris leads him to seek comfort in a relationship with porn star Ashley St. Ives, further complicating their professional and personal dynamics. Casey, on the other hand, is dealing with her own share of struggles as she navigates her mistrust of men and becomes entangled with lesbian clothes designer, Roxanne. This relationship not only affects her personal life but could potentially create friction within the trio and their manager, Harris. Meanwhile, Petronella experiences a seemingly idyllic romance with law student Emerson Thorne, but as a member of the rock trio, she inevitably faces the challenges of balancing a career in the public eye and a private romance.

Given the following passage  \\"The pro-decolonisation Labour government, elected at the 1945 general election and led by Clement Attlee, moved quickly to tackle the most pressing issue facing the empire: that of Indian independence. India's two major political parties—the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League—had been campaigning for independence for decades, but disagreed as to how it should be implemented. Congress favoured a unified secular Indian state, whereas the League, fearing domination by the Hindu majority, desired a separate Islamic state for Muslim-majority regions. Increasing civil unrest and the mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy during 1946 led Attlee to promise independence no later than 1948. When the urgency of the situation and risk of civil war became apparent, the newly appointed (and last) Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, hastily brought forward the date to 15 August 1947. The borders drawn by the British to broadly partition India into Hindu and Muslim areas left tens of millions as minorities in the newly independent states of India and Pakistan. Millions of Muslims subsequently crossed from India to Pakistan and Hindus vice versa, and violence between the two communities cost hundreds of thousands of lives. Burma, which had been administered as part of the British Raj, and Sri Lanka gained their independence the following year in 1948.

Options are: A). no; B). yes;","output":"First, let's analyze the pros and cons of PostgreSQL and MySQL: PostgreSQL: Pros: 1. Open-source: PostgreSQL is completely free and open-source, allowing for easy accessibility and modification. 2. Compliance with SQL standards: It adheres to SQL standards, ensuring consistent and accurate syntax. 3. Extensibility: PostgreSQL supports various custom operators and functions, allowing for flexibility in database management. 4. Complex data types: Supports various data types like arrays, hstore, and JSON, extending database functionality. 5. Good concurrency control: Performs well in multiple concurrent user environments. Cons: 1. Slower performance: Can be slower compared to other databases due to its emphasis on reliability and correctness. 2. Less widespread adoption: Has a smaller community than MySQL, which might lead to limited support or resources. MySQL: Pros: 1. Open-source: MySQL is also free and open-source, making it accessible and modifiable. 2. High performance: MySQL is known for its speed, making it suitable for large databases and high-traffic websites. 3. Scalability: MySQL can support a large number of concurrent connections without compromising performance. 4. Robust security: Provides strong security with secure connections, encryption, and user privilege management. 5. Large user community: MySQL has a widespread user base, ensuring extensive support and resources. Cons: 1. Limited support for advanced features: MySQL lacks some features found in other databases, like complex data types and custom functions. 2. Less strict data integrity: MySQL's default settings may allow for inconsistent data storage, which can be troublesome for some applications. Now let's analyze the pros and cons of PostgreSQL, PGStrom, MapD, and BlazingDB (one over the other): 1. PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source database system with a strong focus on reliability, data integrity, and standards compliance. It has a large selection of data types and is highly extensible, as mentioned above. 2. PGStrom is an extension of PostgreSQL that accelerates data processing by leveraging GPU capabilities. It provides faster performance by offloading CPU tasks and is particularly suitable for analytical workloads and massive parallel processing. 3. MapD (renamed as OmniSci) is a high-performance, GPU-accelerated, SQL-based analytics platform designed for real-time processing of large datasets. It delivers faster query response times and is capable of handling real-time data visualization. 4. BlazingDB is a GPU-accelerated SQL engine designed to handle large-scale analytical workloads. It is built on the RAPIDS framework and provides fast query processing and efficient memory utilization. Note that PGStrom, MapD, and BlazingDB are primarily focused on exploiting GPU capabilities to provide accelerated performance for specific workloads. PostgreSQL is a general-purpose relational database system. Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Options are: A). no; B). yes; My answer: A). no; The first question covers the comparison between PostgreSQL and MySQL, while the second question involves a comparison of four different technologies, including PostgreSQL in the context of GPU acceleration.

Jackson denied the claims and settled the civil case out of court for a payment of 15 million plus legal fees; the settlement included a nondisclosure agreement. No criminal charges were filed. In 2005, following further allegations, prompted by the 2003 documentary Living with Michael Jackson in which he was holding hands with a boy named Gavin Arvizo and talked about his sleepovers with children, Jackson was acquitted of child sexual abuse charges.In 2013, choreographer Wade Robson filed a civil lawsuit alleging that Jackson had sexually abused him for seven years, beginning when he was seven years old.

The region is the most popular on Spain’s mainland for foreign buyers, according to land registry figures which show the proportion of villas and apartments bought by overseas buyers has almost tripled in the past four years to 11.15 per cent. Holidaymakers enjoy the sun and the beach life of Benidorm during its 1970s heyday. The region went from a must-go holiday resort to a place to be avoided to now a place for people to buy a second home. A view of the Europe's tallest residential building at 650 ft high, in the eastern coastal village of Benidorm. British buyers have taken advantage of the pound’s strength against the euro. Typically, a three-bedroom, two-bathroom villa with a pool is £158,000. The area is also popular because budget airlines fly to nearby Alicante from regional UK airports and not just London ones. But there is also a sense of nostalgia for Britons returning to a region of Spain that became famous for being among the first destinations for mass market package tours. Even the name Costa Blanca for the 125-mile coastline was invented by British airline BEA when it opened a route to Valencia, the capital of the region, in 1957.

Unfortunately the region suffered from an image of ugly high rise hotels, parades of British pubs and legions of lager louts from Britain getting drunk in nightclubs. Kieran Byrne, the managing director of HomeEspana said: ‘The sustained weakness of the euro this year is helping to attract more British and Scandinavian buyers. ‘We don't expect a rapid turnaround in market conditions in Spain, but at least in the Costa Blanca we have seen increased buyer interest in the first quarter of 2014. ‘More second homebuyers from abroad are discovering how far their money goes here.’ Benidorm has tried to shed its image as a haven for British lager louts, although it is still portrayed as downmarket in ITV comedy Benidorm.

Scott is drawn into a clandestine operation to find Laura Newton, the President's daughter, who is missing. Their search takes them to a bar where girls are recruited as prostitutes, and Scott's team follows a middleman to a bordello that funnels some of these girls to an international sex slavery ring. The madam gives them a contact number leading to a pay phone. Calls placed to the pay phone are traced back to Tariq Asani, a Lebanese national currently in federal prison. They plan to intercept Asani during a prisoner transport and gain information from him about the sex trafficking operation. When the car carrying Asani and another prisoner stops en route to its destination, Scott shows up and appears to kill the transport guard, then kills the other prisoner (who was on death row).

Please answer the following question: We've heard about radiation from the damaged nuclear reactors in Japan reaching American shores. Experts say so far there is no reason to worry, and point out that we meet radiation every day. Where and how? NPR's Renee Montagne posed that question to Peter Caracappa, a radiation safety officer and professor of nuclear engineering. MONTAGNE: How many things emit radiation? Dr CARACAPPA: Well, radiation and radioactive material is a part of nature. So everything that's living has some amount of radiation coming from it--a very small amout. Plus there's radiation in the ground and the air. So the extremes are uranium in the soil to bananas? Yes. By the way, why do bananas have radiation? Bananas have a lot of potassium . And a small amount of potassium naturally is called potassium 40, which is radioactive What's the difference between radiation that's harmful and not harmful? Well, the term radiation can apply to a lot of different things. But the harmful radiation is ionizing radiation. It has enough energy that it can make chemical changes in material. We could get ionizing radiation from an X-ray, for example. It's the kind of radiation that causes cancer. The broader definition of radiation includes a lot of things that we call non-ionizing radiation. That includes everything like radio waves and visible light and your microwave. So what then is the largest contributor of ionizing radiation? For the natural sources of ionizing radiation, actually the biggest chunk of that tends to come from radon , which is a radioactive material that is present in the air. It can become a concern when it builds up in low-lying areas of homes like basements. Would it be fair to say that most people do not need to worry about the danger of being exposed to radiation? I would say that the everyday exposure to radioation that we meet contributes an extremely tiny risk to our life or to our health compared to all of the other risks that we meet in our day-to-day life.

The interior design boasts a mix of modern elegance and rustic charm, accentuated by carefully chosen lighting that creates an intimate atmosphere. The floor-to-ceiling windows offer a stunning view of the sunset, which, true to its name, complements the overall dining experience. The menu offered a wonderful array of dishes, showcasing a blend of traditional and innovative culinary techniques. It was an excellent fusion of flavors, textures, and colors, making it a true feast for both the eyes and the palate. The chef's attention to detail and commitment to using fresh and locally sourced ingredients clearly shined through each dish.  As a seafood lover, I decided to start with the pan-seared scallops for my appetizer. They were perfectly cooked with a golden-crust finish, while still tender and succulent on the inside, accompanied by a delightful cauliflower puree and topped with crisp microgreens. The dish successfully showcased a balance of flavors and textures, leaving me eager for my main course. For my entrée, I chose the grilled herb-crusted salmon, which arrived beautifully plated. The salmon was cooked to perfection, flaky and moist, rich in flavors, and enhanced by a symphony of herbs that elevated the dish to new heights. The accompanying grilled vegetables and lemon-dill sauce harmoniously blended with the salmon, revealing the chef's flair for creating exceptional dining experiences. The wine list was impressive, offering a variety of options that catered to different preferences and budgets. The knowledgeable sommelier made excellent recommendations, helping me to select a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc that paired beautifully with my meal. To end the meal on a sweet note, I opted for the chocolate lava cake, and it did not disappoint. The cake was rich and indulgent, with a molten chocolate core that oozed out as I cut into it. Paired with a scoop of velvety vanilla ice cream, the dessert proved to be the perfect finale to an exceptional dining experience. Throughout the evening, the service staff was attentive without being intrusive, creating a comfortable dining environment that allowed me to truly savor the phenomenal food and the company of my fellow diners. The servers were also well-versed in the menu, offering valuable insights and guidance when it came to my selections. Overall, my experience at Sunset Bistro was nothing short of extraordinary.

Answer:","output":"The genus with more species between Akebia and Verbascum can be determined by understanding each genus, their taxonomical classification, and their variety of species. Akebia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lardizabalaceae, which comprises woody vines that are native to the temperate regions of Asia. The Akebia genus is also sometimes referred to as chocolate vines due to the distinct aroma produced by some of its species' flowers. Akebia consists of five species, which are: 1. Akebia quinata (also known as Chocolate Vine or Five-leaf Akebia) 2. Akebia trifoliata (Three-leaf Akebia) 3. Akebia longeracemosa (Long-racemed Akebia) 4. Akebia pentaphylla (Fiveleaf Akebia) 5. Akebia × hokkaidoi (Hybrid species of Akebia) On the other hand, Verbascum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Scrophulariaceae, commonly known as mulleins. These plants are widely distributed throughout Europe, Asia, and northern Africa. Verbascums are mostly biennial or perennial plants with elegant flower spikes forming a distinctive feature of this genus. Depending on the source, the Verbascum genus consists of approximately 250-360 species. Some of the well-known species in this genus are: 1. Verbascum thapsus (Great Mullein or Common Mullein) 2. Verbascum phoeniceum (Purple Mullein) 3. Verbascum nigrum (Black Mullein) 4. Verbascum blattaria (Moth Mullein) 5. Verbascum lychnitis (White Mullein) 6. Verbascum olympicum (Olympian Mullein) By comparing the number of species between the two genera, it's evident that the genus Verbascum contains significantly more species, ranging from approximately 250-360 different species compared to Akebia's five species.

Tom Kelly and Claire Ellicott. PUBLISHED:. 08:32 EST, 11 March 2013. |. UPDATED:. 19:38 EST, 11 March 2013. A socialite and friend of the stars has been found murdered in his £2million Mayfair home. Robert Troyan, 63, was discovered with a gash to his head in a pool of blood by his horrified maid in the kitchen of the luxury flat. He knew Sting and the musician’s wife Trudie Styler through his late partner, architect and interior designer Anthony Feldman, whose clients included Princess Michael of Kent and former Tory Cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken. Murder probe launched: The body of Robert Troyan, 63, was discovered at his luxury flat in this apartment block in Mount Street, Mayfair. Before Mr Feldman’s death, the couple. were famed for their lavish Mayfair dinner parties where guests said the. champagne was ‘always chilled and ready to open’. Mr Troyan is believed to have spoken. to his maid by phone only two hours before his body was found last. Friday afternoon. After making the grim discovery when she arrived at. the mansion block at 4pm, she collapsed on her knees in hysterical. screams. The building's caretaker said retired American Mr Troyan's regular cleaner was 'uncontrollable' after finding his body on Friday afternoon. A source at the block said: ‘It was a head wound, there was blood pouring on the floor. ‘Workmen working above – they are. doing a new kitchen – heard her screaming and shouting. The workmen said. they didn’t touch his body, but could tell that he wasn’t breathing.’ ‘His cleaner was inconsolable. The. police had to take her to the police station, and she was on her hands. and knees crying her eyes out.’ The source said Mr Troyan was always. friendly but ‘would often be visited by strange men, at all times of the. day and night’, at the flat, which he rented. Black bags removed from the flat every. morning could be heard ‘rattling with bottles’. He added: ‘One guy who. visited was staggering a lot. This was in the afternoon. I think it was. just drink, not drugs. He never came back again.’ Mr Troyan sometimes played loud music. and had noisy conversations, and the people in the flat below had. complained on at least one occasion. He was born in Italy to a wealthy. family but lived in the US for most of his youth. Mr Troyan studied art. at college in Boston before moving to Britain, where he met Mr Feldman. in 1983. An obituary in the Times after Mr. Feldman’s death said: ‘They were both immensely kind and generous to. people in need and to charities for the homeless.

Although the information provided about Rhode Island being the last of the thirteen original colonies to ratify the United States Constitution is accurate, it doesn't address the actual question asked about how people in Rhode Island use the land. Rhode Island, despite its small size, has a diverse landscape that is put to various uses. Here is a better response to the question: The land of Rhode Island is used in a variety of ways by its residents, owing to its diverse geography, a mix of coastal, rural and urban areas. 1. Agriculture: Although Rhode Island is not extensively farmed due to its small size, some land is devoted to agriculture, particularly in the more rural parts of the state. The state is known for its dairy farming, orchards, and vineyards. Notably, Rhode Island is home to extensive potato farming. 2. Industry: The land across the state is used for various types of industries. This includes manufacturing, particularly in the metropolitan areas. The Providence area, for example, has historically been a center for manufacturing, including jewelry, fabricated metal products, and machinery. 3. Residential: Of course, a large portion of the land is used for residential purposes. Residents live in various types of homes, from apartments in high-rise buildings in the cities to single-family homes in the suburbs and rural areas. 4. Commercial: Many areas, especially in the urban centers, are used for commerce, including retail businesses, restaurants, offices, and other service industries. 5. Recreation and Tourism: Given its extensive coastline, many parts of Rhode Island are dedicated to recreational activities and tourism. This includes everything from beaches and boating facilities to parks and golf courses. 6. Education: Rhode Island is home to a number of higher education institutions, so portions of the land are used for their campuses, including Brown University, the Rhode Island School of Design, and the University of Rhode Island. 7. Conservation: Finally, an important use of Rhode Island's land is for conservation and natural preservation. There are a number of state parks and protected areas throughout the state that are important for wildlife, preservation of natural habitats, and providing space for outdoor recreation.  Overall, while Rhode Island is one of the smallest states, its land is put to diverse and multi-faceted use."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: In a race with national implications, Democrat Conor Lamb declared victory in a very close special congressional election held Tuesday in Pennsylvania. Officially, the race has not been called for Lamb, who holds a lead of 627 votes over Republican candidate Rick Saccone, a strong supporter of President Donald Trump. It’s possible Saccone and his supporters may request a recount, given the close vote. Even though Lamb’s apparent victory is narrow, the Pennsylvania result could broaden implications for Republicans looking to defend their congressional majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate in the November midterm elections. Lamb ran surprisingly strong in a district that Trump carried by nearly 20 points, campaigning as a moderate Democrat. “We fought to find common ground, and we found it, almost everywhere. Democrats, Republicans, independents — each of us, Americans,” Lamb told supporters early Wednesday. Saccone was not ready to concede the race. “We are going to fight all the way to the end. You know I never give up.” The Pennsylvania race follows Democratic victories late last year in Virginia and Alabama, fueled in large part by what some analysts see as an anti-Trump theme that continues to build. “The opposition to Donald Trump is as intense as I have seen since the last year of [Richard] Nixon’s presidency,\\" said University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato via Skype. “It is so intense, it is so hot, that it could result in a much bigger turnover than we think in the midterm elections to the Democrats and away from the Republicans.” Saccone cast himself as the president’s “wingman,” and Trump campaigned on his behalf at a rally last Saturday when Trump urged Republicans to get out and vote. “We want to keep the agenda, the make America great, going. You have got to get him in. This is a very important race,” Trump said. Democrats were thrilled with the result, while some Republicans saw the race as a “wake-up” call for what could be a devastating midterm in November. Question: What is probably true about Rick Saccone? Options: - He hoped more republicans had come out to vote for him   - not enough information   - He wanted a recount   - He was not ready to concede the race === The correct answer is A:","output":"He was not ready to concede the race"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The protesters later regrouped outside the interior ministry and clashes broke out with police. Fighting escalated and moved to Tahrir Square where lines of riot police carrying shields sealed off the main streets and dozens of security vehicles parked in side streets.

Determine the sentiment: After reading the book, which had a lot of meaning for me, the movie didn't give me any of the feeling which the book conveyed. This makes me wonder if Kaufman even liked this book for he successfully made it into something else.Either that or he is simply bad. Most importantly where is the lightness?! From the very first scene, music drownes out most of the dialogue and feeling, and this continues right through the movie. I think the makers thought that by having upbeat music playing right through the movie, this would make the story feel light- however they have completely failed here. Instead the music manages to give everything that 'movie feel', in a way dramatising events so that we linger on them, so that everything actually feels heavy. Another example of the how this adaptation fails is by embellishing the story line making it more dramatic. In the movie we see Franz passing Tomas on the street, who is on his way to see Sabina. The introduction of this chance meeting/passing, which im sure didn't happen in the book, gives Tomas' story more significance than it does make it light. There are many other examples where the continuity of the story has been changed, imo for the worst, however this might have been done because the book simply doesn't convert well into a movie, such is Kundera's style. This makes we wonder if all the generous reviewers on this site were writing with their book AND movie experience in mind rather than writing about just the film.

Coolidge was shocked when Oliphant informed him that the British had predicted that only ten kilograms of uranium-235 would be sufficient to supply a chain reaction effected by fast moving neutrons. While in America, Oliphant discovered that the chairman of the OSRD S-1 Section, Lyman Briggs, had locked away the MAUD reports transferred from Britain entailing the initial discoveries and had not informed the S-1 Committee members of all its findings.Oliphant took the initiative himself to enlighten the scientific community in the U.S. of the recent ground breaking discoveries the MAUD Committee had just exposed. Oliphant also travelled to Berkley to meet with Ernest Lawrence, inventor of the cyclotron. After Oliphant informed Lawrence of his report on uranium, Lawrence met with NDRC chairman James Bryant Conant, George B. Pegram, and Arthur Compton to relay the details which Oliphant had directed to Lawrence. Oliphant was not only able to get in touch with Lawrence, but he met with Conant and Bush to inform them of the significant data the MAUD had discovered. Oliphant’s ability to inform the Americans led to Oliphant convincing Lawrence, Lawrence convincing Compton, and then Kistiakowsky convincing Conant to move forward with nuclear weapons. These actions from Oliphant resulted in Bush taking this report directly to the president.

Sanya, China (CNN) -- A leadership summit of five emerging economic powers took a decidedly political turn on Thursday, going beyond customary economic issues with a joint declaration against Western-led airstrikes in Libya and urging a peaceful solution to the conflict. \\"We share the principle that the use of force should be avoided,\\" the heads of state of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa declared in the Sanya Declaration, which was issued at the conclusion of the annual BRICS Summit in this southern China resort city. Earlier this year, Brazil, Russia, India and China abstained from voting on a United Nations Security Council resolution that authorized a no-fly zone over Libya. By contrast, South Africa had voted in favor of the resolution.

Please answer the following question: Question: Where would you go if you only wanted to buy clothes?  Choices:  - house - clothing store - toy store - mall - bedroom  The rationale to choose \\"clothing store\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"The most appropriate choice for purchasing clothes would undoubtedly be the \\"clothing store.\\" There are numerous logical and practical reasons behind this choice, which are detailed below: 1. Purpose: Clothing stores are specifically designed and targeted for the sale of garments and fashion accessories. Unlike other options such as houses, toy stores, or bedrooms, clothing stores contain a wide variety of apparel to cater to the needs of customers solely looking to purchase clothing. 2. Variety: Clothing stores typically offer an extensive range of options for customers to choose from, catering to different styles, budgets, and tastes. This variety ensures that a consumer can find and purchase clothing items that best fit their personal preferences and requirements. 3. Quality: Clothing stores often adhere to strict quality standards to ensure they sell only the best apparel to customers. This guarantee of quality gives customers peace of mind, knowing that the clothes they purchase are likely to be well-made, durable, and fashionable. 4. Merchandise Display: Clothing stores are designed to showcase and display clothing items attractively and effectively. This allows customers to browse and select items easily, try them on in fitting rooms, and access staff members to help them with any questions they may have. 5. Customer Service: Professional staff with specialized knowledge about fabrics, fits, and fashion trends are present in clothing stores to provide customers with expert guidance, helping them to choose the best garments that cater to their style preferences, body shape, and budget. 6. Sales and Promotions: Clothing stores regularly conduct sales and promotions to attract customers. These incentives make shopping for clothes more affordable and provide customers with the opportunity to purchase a wider variety of items at discounted prices. 7. Specialized Items: Clothing stores also tend to include specialized sections for specific types of garments, such as activewear, swimwear, formal attire, or maternity wear. This makes it easier for customers looking to purchase clothing for specific purposes to find exactly what they need. Although some might consider a mall an appropriate place to buy clothes, it is essential to note that a mall itself is a collection of various stores, including clothing stores. Therefore, it is ultimately the clothing stores within the mall that meet the clothing requirements of customers. In conclusion, the best answer is the \\"clothing store\\" when considering a location solely for purchasing clothing. This option ensures that customers will have access to various styles, high-quality garments, and expert assistance for a satisfactory clothing shopping experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.  - The Province of the Cape of Good Hope, commonly referred to as the Cape Province, was a province in the Union of South Africa and subsequently the Republic of South Africa. It encompassed the old Cape Colony, and had Cape Town as its capital. Following the end of the Apartheid era, the Cape Province was split up to form the new Eastern Cape, Northern Cape and Western Cape provinces.  - Namibia, officially the Republic of Namibia (German: ), is a country in southern Africa whose western border is the Atlantic Ocean. It shares land borders with Zambia and Angola to the north, Botswana to the east and South Africa to the south and east. Although it does not border Zimbabwe, a part of less than 200 metres of the Zambezi River (essentially a small bulge in Botswana to achieve a Botswana/Zambia micro-border) separates the two countries. Namibia gained independence from South Africa on 21 March 1990, following the Namibian War of Independence. Its capital and largest city is Windhoek, and it is a member state of the United Nations (UN), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the African Union (AU), and the Commonwealth of Nations.  - South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded on the south by of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland, and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho. South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 56 million people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status. The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured) ancestry.  - Ciskei (or ) was a nominally independent state  a Bantustan  in the south east of South Africa. It covered an area of , almost entirely surrounded by what was then the Cape Province, and possessed a small coastline along the shore of the Indian Ocean.  - Apartheid was a system of institutionalised racial segregation and discrimination in South Africa between 1948 and 1991, when it was abolished. The country's first multiracial elections under a universal franchise were held three years later in 1994. Broadly speaking, apartheid was delineated into \\"petty apartheid\\", which entailed the segregation of public facilities and social events, and \\"grand apartheid\\", which dictated housing and employment opportunities by race. Prior to the 1940s, some vestiges of apartheid had already emerged in the form of minority rule by white South Africans and the socially enforced separation of black South Africans from other races, which later extended to pass laws and land apportionment. Apartheid as a policy was embraced by the South African government shortly after the ascension of the National Party (NP) during the country's 1948 general elections. Apartheid was also enforced in South West Africa until it gained independence as Namibia in 1990.  - The Eastern Cape is a province of South Africa. Its capital is Bhisho, but its two largest cities are Port Elizabeth and East London. It was formed in 1994 out of the Xhosa homelands of Transkei and Ciskei, together with the eastern portion of the Cape Province. Landing place and home of the 1820 settlers, the central and eastern part of the province is the traditional home of the Xhosa people. This region is the birthplace of many prominent South African politicians, such as Nelson Mandela, Oliver Tambo, Walter Sisulu, Govan Mbeki, Raymond Mhlaba, Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe, Chris Hani, Thabo Mbeki, Steve Biko, Bantu Holomisa and Charles Coghlan.  - Oliver Reginald Tambo (27 October 191724 April 1993) was a South African anti-apartheid politician and revolutionary who served as President of the African National Congress (ANC) from 1967 to 1991.  - Raymond Mhlaba (12 February 1920  20 February 2005) was an anti-apartheid activist and leader of the African National Congress (ANC).  - Bantubonke Harrington Holomisa (born 25 July 1955) is a South African Member of Parliament and President of the United Democratic Movement.  - Durban (from \\"itheku\\" meaning \\"bay/lagoon\\") is the largest city in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal.

His government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid by tackling institutionalised racism and fostering racial reconciliation. Ideologically an African nationalist and socialist, he served as President of the African National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997. A Xhosa, Mandela was born in Mvezo to the Thembu royal family. He studied law at the University of Fort Hare and the University of the Witwatersrand before working as a lawyer in Johannesburg.

Step 1: Move the \\"103 * t\\" from the right side of the equation to the left side. We do that by subtracting \\"103 * t\\" from both sides. 109 * t - 103 * t - 60 = 103 * t - 103 * t This simplifies to: (109 - 103) * t - 60 = 0 Step 2: Calculate \\"109 - 103\\" which is equal to 6. 6 * t - 60 = 0 Step 3: Now, let's add 60 to both sides of the equation.

Besides containing attractive flowers, trees and other plants that beautify the community, eco-friendly rain gardens are healthy for the environment and the people living and working nearby. A rain garden  is not very different from a traditional garden. It is just a far more eco-friendly garden. Usually it is built lower than the ground. Rain gardens make smart use of rain and storm water by temporarily holding water from rain and storms and letting it soak slowly into the ground before it runs into streams or enters the public drinking water supply. Thus, a rain garden keeps the water, allowing it to be used as needed by plants in the rain garden, rather than flowing immediately into nearby streams and going unused. The water will soak slowly into the ground within a day or two. This creates an advantage that the rain garden does not allow mosquitoes to breed. This is a simple, attractive, and eco-friendly \\"green\\" way to treat storm water. What's more, planting a rain garden helps reduce pollution and improve the environment. Without using expensive machinery and chemicals, rain gardens remove harmful chemicals in the rainwater and cut down on the amount of pollution reaching streams and rivers by up to 30%. Native plants are recommended for rain gardens because they are more used to the locals climate, soil, and water conditions. They may attract local wildlife such as native birds. Water your rain garden immediately after planting and once a week, unless you have had at least an inch of rain during the week. Once the native plants establish the necessary root system, it will require little care. Often, local governments and private businesses develop large rain gardens in their yards and in public parks as a way to improve the environment and solve flooding problems. However, you don't need to be a professional environmental engineer to create a rain garden. As long as you're eco-conscious homeowners, you can help the environment by building smaller rain gardens in your yards. Who are the intended readers of the passage? A) Homeowners. B) Students.

Men who were at war against them would hear these sounds and run away. They thought those strange sounds were made by gods in the sky. The ancient Chinese also flew kites to bring good luck and to make their crops grow rich and tall. Sometimes they tied long strings and hooks  to their kites. Then they would fly the kites over water, letting the hooks hang down to catch fish. The Chinese use sticks, string and paper for their kites. Some of these kites look like animals or trees and others look like houses. Question: Chinese made and flew kites   _  .

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Asset allocation refers to the percentage of your portfolio allocated to each type of asset class. Asset classes can include equities (which include stocks, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds), bonds, cash, and much more. Your portfolio should have an appropriate allocation to each of these categories depending on your appetite for risk, and investing goals.  Money-market funds or treasuries have the lowest risk also the lowest returns. Investment-grade bonds are considered higher risk and higher return than money-market funds or treasuries, and stocks are considered the highest risk and highest return options. Therefore, if you are a conservative investor who is more concerned with protecting your capital, while earning a small but stable return, a portfolio of 75% bonds, 15% stocks, and 10% cash or money-market funds would be appropriate. If you are looking for a balance between risk and return, a 50% stock, and 10% cash, and 40% bond approach would be reasonable. If you are an investor willing to take on high-risk is exchange for potentially high returns, 80-90% stocks and 10% bonds or cash would be appropriate. Re-balancing refers to the act of selling or buying stocks to either restore your target asset allocation (as discussed above), or to establish a new asset allocation.  Re-balancing can occur on many time-frames, but an often recommended time frame is once a year, since this reduces fees associated with transactions. Therefore, re-balancing would involve checking on your asset allocation annually.  If you find one asset class has grown beyond your target asset allocation, and you still have faith in your original asset allocation, selling could be a possibility. For example, it is possible that ,if you opted for a 60% stock, 40% bond allocation, this allocation could change to 64% stocks and 36% bonds, if the stock market does extremely well. For example, assume you had a 100,000 portfolio, with 60,000 in stocks and 40,000 in bonds at the end of last year. At the end of the year, you have 80,000 in stocks, and 45,000 in bonds. At this point, your portfolio would be worth 125,000, with stocks representing 64%, and bonds representing 34%. In the above example, if you still want to keep your 60% stock, and 40% bond allocation, you would need to sell some stock to bring it back down. To determine how much to sell to create a 60% stock allocation once again, begin with your total portfolio value, or 125,000. Multiply 125,000 by 0.60 (or 60%), and this will tell you what 60% of 125,000 is. In this case, it would be 75,000. Since you currently have 80,000 in stock, you would need to sell 5,000 to re-balance your portfolio. Seeing your stock allocation rise beyond your target amount can be an excellent reason to sell. The question is, how do you determine which stock to sell (assuming you have more than one)? In this case, you have a few options. The first is to sell the stock that is most overvalued. Conversely, you can also sell a stock that has lost money in order to benefit from tax loss harvesting. You can also consider looking to your biggest winners, and consider selling 50% of a winning stock as a way to lock-in your profits. It may be tempting to sell a stock that has been flat over the course the year for re-balancing purposes, and move that money into a winning stock that may or may not be overvalued. Be very cautious with this  If the stock that remained flat is still undervalued, or is still a good investment according to whatever means you used to analyze it, hold that stock unless you have an alternative with a better risk/reward profile. It is not uncommon for the market to take a long period to recognize the value of a particular company. Try to avoid selling stocks simply because they have lost value. While it may be tempting to sell a stock after it has lost 10% or 15%, a selling decision needs to be based not on what is happening to the price of the investment, but instead on changes to your initial reason for investing. Stocks can be incredibly volatile and can move due to factors not related to the individual business at all (like events in the global economy). Therefore, only sell when there has been a fundamental change to the business that refutes your original reason for investing (like the stock no longer being undervalued, or a major change in the competitive landscape). Summary:","output":"Asset allocation means dividing your money into different types of investments, like stocks, bonds, and cash. This helps you balance risk and reward in your portfolio. Re-balancing means adjusting your investments to keep the right mix for your goals. You check your allocation every year and sometimes sell some stocks to get your portfolio back on track. When deciding which stock to sell, look at their value, any potential tax benefits, or the profits you've made. Don't sell a stock just because it hasn't grown a lot; only sell if something has changed that makes it no longer a good investment for you. Remember, investing can be like a roller coaster ride, so stay focused on your long-term goals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: suppose the stomach inst working properly happens, how will it affect Bread is protected from mold spores.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"less effect. To elaborate on the answer, we must first analyze the entire context of the process and the provided scenario. The original process in the context of bread getting moldy involves the following steps: 1. Bread is exposed to the elements. 2. Bread absorbs water from the air. 3. Bread absorbs warmth from the air. 4. Dust particles with mold spores fall on bread. 5. Mold spores start to consume the bread for energy. 6. Mold colonies grow until they are visible. Now, let's consider the given scenario: the stomach isn't working properly, and the bread is protected from mold spores. Under these circumstances, we will examine how this perturbation affects the second effect mentioned in the process. In this case, the second effect involves the bread absorbing water from the air. When the stomach is malfunctioning and the bread is protected from mold spores, the ability of the bread to absorb water from the air is less relevant in the context of mold growth. Since mold isn't present in this scenario, the risk of mold growth is mitigated. However, it doesn't mean that the bread won't absorb moisture from the air in general. Environmental factors, such as humidity, may still cause the bread to absorb water. But in this particular case, the perturbation, i.e., the stomach malfunctions and protection from mold spores, has less effect on the second step of the process in terms of mold growth. The protection of bread from mold spores plays a significant role in avoiding mold formation, as the mold spores can't find a suitable host to consume for energy and grow further. This reduces the importance of the bread absorbing water from the air with respect to mold growth, thereby having a less effect on the overall process of mold formation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Pressure is what results when gas particles rebound off the walls of their container. The basic unit of pressure is the newton per square meter (N/m2). This combined unit is redefined as a pascal (Pa). One pascal is not a very large amount of pressure. A more useful unit of pressure is the bar, which is 100,000 Pa (1 bar = 100,000 Pa). Other common units of pressure are the atmosphere (atm), which was originally defined as the average pressure of Earth’s atmosphere at sea level; and mmHg (millimeters of mercury), which is the pressure generated by a column of mercury 1 mm high. The unit millimeters of mercury is also called a torr, named after the Italian scientist Evangelista Torricelli, who invented the barometer in the mid1600s. A more precise definition of atmosphere, in terms of torr, is that there are exactly 760 torr in 1 atm. A bar equals 1.01325 atm.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis in this scenario supposes that during Spring, an unexpected event occurs that may potentially affect the animal's ability to hibernate properly. To analyze the impact of this perturbation on the hibernation process, it is essential to understand each stage of hibernation and how potential changes in the environment might interfere with them. 1. The animal eats large quantities of food that will be stored as fat: During the preparation for hibernation, the animal consumes significant amounts of food in order to store enough fat to survive the hibernation period. If, during Spring, the availability or the quality of this food source is affected (for example, due to climate changes or human intervention), the animal may not be able to accumulate the necessary fat reserves, which could compromise its ability to hibernate properly. 2. Winter comes and the animal finds a place to hibernate: When winter approaches, the animal will seek a suitable location to hibernate. This place should provide protection against the external environment and potential predators. If, during Spring, there is a change in the landscape (for instance, due to deforestation or other factors), the animal might struggle to find a proper location for hibernation, impacting its ability to survive through the winter. 3. Over a period of days, the animal's heart rate and breathing rate drop slowly: As hibernation approaches, the animal's physiological processes slow down considerably, enabling it to survive on minimal energy. If the Spring perturbation causes a sudden shift in temperature or other external factors, the animal could face difficulties in fully entering this state of hibernation, affecting its ability to conserve energy and increasing its chances of facing health complications. 4. Electrical activity in the brain almost ceases completely, though some areas remain active: During hibernation, brain activity slows down significantly, but some areas remain responsive to external stimuli. If the perturbation during Spring leads to an increase in external disturbances (for example, loud noises due to human activity), the animal's brain might not fully enter the hibernation state. This could result in higher energy consumption and a compromised hibernation process. 5. The animal has entered hibernation mode: Once in hibernation, the animal intends to stay in this low-energy state for an extended period, relying on its fat reserves for survival. If the Spring perturbation affects the length or intensity of winter, the animal's hibernation period might be disrupted. This could force the animal to exit hibernation prematurely, without having replenished its energy reserves, leading to possible starvation or weakened immunity. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that a change occurring during Spring can indeed affect the animal's ability to hibernate properly, either directly or indirectly. Depending on the type and magnitude of the perturbation, it could impact the animal's preparation, the hibernation environment, or its physiological processes during hibernation, ultimately affecting its chances of surviving through the winter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

John is eager to find a new home.","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"John is eager to find a new home.\\" is linguistically acceptable. Let's analyze the sentence in terms of its grammar, syntax, and meaning to explain why it is an acceptable and well-formed sentence. 1. Grammar: The sentence follows proper grammatical rules, including subject-verb agreement and appropriate word forms.    - Subject: 'John' is the subject of the sentence, which is a proper noun and serves as the performer of the action (finding a new home).    - Verb: 'is' is an auxiliary verb that agrees with the singular subject (John), and 'eager' is an adjective that describes the subject's emotion or state.    - Infinitive phrase: 'to find a new home' functions as a complement to the adjective 'eager' and provides additional information about John's eagerness. Here, 'to find' is an infinitive verb, and 'a new home' is the direct object of the verb 'to find.' 2. Syntax: The sentence maintains a clear and logical word order, which is essential for conveying meaning.    - The subject 'John' appears first, followed by the auxiliary verb 'is' and the adjective 'eager.'    - The infinitive phrase 'to find a new home' immediately follows the adjective, which is typical when an infinitive phrase functions as a complement.    - The word order follows the standard English syntax of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), with the object contained within the infinitive phrase. 3. Meaning: The message conveyed by the sentence is easy to understand and unambiguous.    - John, as an individual, feels an intense desire or enthusiasm for finding a new place to live.    - The use of 'eager' emphasizes the heightened emotional state, and the specifics of the action (finding a new home) are clear and concise. Overall, the sentence \\"John is eager to find a new home.\\" is linguistically acceptable. It demonstrates proper English grammar, syntax, and meaning, making it an effective and clear expression of a thought or idea."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Why is Promethazine DM considered a narcotic? Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"Zoloft (sertraline) is not considered a narcotic. It is classified as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and belongs to a class of drugs called antidepressants. SSRIs work by increasing the amount of serotonin, a neurotransmitter, in the synapses of the brain. Serotonin is responsible for regulating mood, sleep, appetite, and various other physiological processes. Zoloft is primarily prescribed for the treatment of conditions such as depression, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The term \\"narcotic\\" is often used to describe drugs that produce sedation, relieve pain, or have the potential for abuse and addiction. Narcotics typically include opioids, which are derived from opium or synthetic versions of opium-derived compounds. Commonly prescribed opioids include morphine, codeine, oxycodone, and hydrocodone. These medications work by binding to opioid receptors in the brain, spinal cord, and gastrointestinal tract to relieve pain and induce feelings of euphoria. Though Zoloft and other SSRIs can have side effects and interactions with other medications, they do not fall under the category of narcotics, as they do not produce the same sedating or pain-relieving effects as opioids. Promethazine DM, on the other hand, is a combination medication that contains promethazine and dextromethorphan. Promethazine is an antihistamine that treats allergy symptoms such as itching, runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes and also prevents motion sickness and nausea. Dextromethorphan is a cough suppressant that affects the signals in the brain that trigger the cough reflex. Although promethazine has sedative properties and dextromethorphan may have some potential for abuse when used inappropriately, Promethazine DM is typically not considered a narcotic, as it lacks the potency and addictive qualities linked to opioids. While both questions are similar in the sense that they ask whether Zoloft and Promethazine DM are considered narcotics, they are not identical questions. They inquire about different medications, each with its own mechanism of action, usage, and categorization. In summary, neither Zoloft, an SSRI antidepressant, nor Promethazine DM, a combination medication containing an antihistamine and cough suppressant, is considered a narcotic."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It took until the 34th minute before Murphy fired home left-footed from six yards before on-loan Ben Turner quickly doubled City's lead with a header. On-loan Murphy then struck twice more inside three minutes before the break. Bradley Dack pulled one back with a left-foot shot on 63 minutes. But it could not stop Gillingham surrendering their lead to City, who climbed to their highest ranking in the Football League since being relegated to the third tier in 2012. Despite controlling the first half hour, City could have fallen behind when Sky Blues old boy Cody McDonald's header was cleared off the line by Jim O'Brien. Instead, the Sky Blues broke down the other end and Murphy took advantage of a mistake by Adedeji Oshilaja to round goalkeeper Stuart Nelson before finishing. Three minutes later, Murphy won the corner that saw Ryan Kent cross for Turner to power home his 37th minute header, marking his first start since his midweek return to the club on loan from Cardiff City.. O'Brien then played in Murphy to round Nelson again before the young on-loan Norwich striker completed his first career treble when he stroked Chris Stokes' cross into the top corner to complete a personal haul of six goals in three games after last weekend's brace at Colchester. Coventry top scorer Adam Armstrong then hit the post before  Dack fired home his consolation goal for the visitors. This was the third time this season that 'second' has played 'first' in League One - and, on each occasion, the game has been won by the chasing side, to ensure new leaders of the division. On both previous occasions, in October, Walsall were the winners, beating first Burton Albion and then Gillingham. Sky Blues boss Tony Mowbray told BBC Coventry & Warwickshire: \\"I'm delighted with a top performance. My job is to inspire the team and get them in the right frame of mind. \\"When they left the dressing room I thought they were ready for a proper game of football, and it proved to be the case. \\"We have to use that as our benchmark and try to attain that performance level as often as we can.\\" Summary:","output":"On-loan Murphy scores a hat-trick, helping Coventry City climb to their highest rank in the Football League since 2012 with a victory over Gillingham."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is because the heating process results in a greater fraction of the liquid’s molecules having the necessary kinetic energy to escape the surface of the liquid. The Figure below shows the kinetic energy distribution of liquid molecules at two temperatures. The numbers of molecules that have the required kinetic energy to evaporate are shown in the shaded area under the curve at the right. The higher temperature liquid (T 2 ) has more molecules that are capable of escaping into the vapor phase than the lower temperature liquid (T 1 ).   Q: Because heating results in a greater fraction of molecules having the necessary kinetic energy to escape the surface of the liquid, what occurs more quickly when liquid is heated?   Choices:  - oxidation  - expansion  - absorption  - evaporation  A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, when a liquid is heated, it results in a greater fraction of the liquid's molecules having the necessary kinetic energy to escape the surface of the liquid. This process allows more molecules to enter the vapor phase, accelerating the transition from the liquid state to the gaseous state. Given the choices: - Oxidation: This refers to a chemical reaction where a substance loses electrons or increases its oxidation state. While heating can accelerate some oxidation processes, the paragraph does not specifically mention this. - Expansion: This generally refers to an increase in volume or size of a substance, often as a result of heating or pressure. While heating a liquid might cause it to expand, the paragraph is mainly focused on the kinetic energy of the molecules and their ability to escape the surface. - Absorption: This refers to the process of one substance being taken up or assimilated by another. The paragraph does not mention this particular process as being affected by heating in the context of kinetic energy distribution. - Evaporation: This refers to the process by which a substance transitions from its liquid state to its gaseous state as a result of the surface molecules gaining enough kinetic energy to escape. Therefore, based on the information provided in the paragraph, evaporation occurs more quickly when the liquid is heated. This is because heating increases the kinetic energy of the molecules, allowing a greater fraction of them to have sufficient energy to escape the surface of the liquid and transition into the vapor phase."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie plot title: Uncle Sam Movie plot: In Kuwait, a military unit uncovers an American helicopter downed by friendly fire at least three years ago. As the wreckage is inspected, Master Sergeant Sam Harper, one of the burnt bodies within, springs to life and kills a sergeant and a major, and returns to an inert state after muttering, \\"Don't be afraid, it's only friendly fire!\\" Weeks later, Sam's body is delivered to his hometown of Twin Rivers, which is preparing for Independence Day. Sam's wife Louise is given custody of the casket containing Sam's remains, which are left in the home of Sam's estranged sister Sally, who lives with her patriotic young son, Jody. Sam reanimates in the early hours of the Fourth of July, and proceeds to kill and steal the costume of a perverted Uncle Sam. Sam then makes his way to a cemetery, where he murders two of three juvenile delinquents who had vandalized tombstones, and desecrated an American flag. During the Independence Day celebration (which a corrupt congressman is visiting) Sam beheads the third delinquent, kills Jody's teacher (who had opposed the Vietnam War) with a hatchet, and shoots Sally's unscrupulous lawyer boyfriend in the head. Despite these deaths, the festivities continue, but are thrown into disarray when Sam uses the fireworks gear to blow up the congressman, and a flagpole to impale Louise's deputy boyfriend.

But those covering the fourth Republican debate will be typing a highly partisan message onto their laptops. That is, at least, if they want to access the Internet.      The Republican National Committee, which handles debate logistics for the party, made “StopHillary” the official Wi-Fi password at the Milwaukee Theatre in Wisconsin.      The password was noted on Twitter by journalists including Benny Johnson, a reporter for the Virginia-based Independent Journal. The Republican National Committee’s account responded to Mr. Johnson’s post with the applause emoji.      “Stop Hillary” has been a refrain of the committee since at least April, when it aired a 30-second attack ad accusing Hillary Rodham Clinton of being secretive, referring to her personal email account and Benghazi. ||||| GOP presidential candidates clashed over immigration, government spending and how to handle Russia's Vladimir Putin during Tuesday night's debate. As the night got heated, the audience got involved: here are the must-watch moments. (Ashleigh Joplin and Rebecca Schatz/Fox Business Network)      GOP presidential candidates clashed over immigration, government spending and how to handle Russia's Vladimir Putin during Tuesday night's debate. As the night got heated, the audience got involved: here are the must-watch moments. (Ashleigh Joplin and Rebecca Schatz/Fox Business Network)      The fourth GOP presidential debate revealed deep splits among the eight candidates on the stage, especially on the subject of foreign policy — in which Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.) and billionaire Donald Trump made an unlikely tag team calling for skepticism about U.S. interventions overseas.      The two come from different places, philosophically: Paul out of a libertarian tradition personified by his father, longtime Rep. Ron Paul (R-Tex.), while Trump’s philosophy seems to be constructed as he goes along, revolving around the twin ideas that Trump makes better deals than anyone, and literally every problem is essentially a deal at its heart.      But the two of them both opposed other candidates — notably former tech executive Carly Fiorina, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) — who called for more aggressive military policies.      “We can’t continue to be the policeman of the world,” Trump said.      “You can be strong without being involved in every civil war around the world,” Paul said.      From left,Marco Rubio, Donald Trump, Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, Carly Fiorina and Rand Paul take the stage. (Morry Gash/AP)      But their alliance was a short-lived one.      In Tuesday night’s debate, Trump faced harsh skepticism from others on the stage. Ohio Gov. John Kasich called Trump’s plans to deport illegal immigrants en masse “silly.” Fiorina jabbed him for saying he knew Putin because they had met in a TV green room. Even Paul, his ally on foreign policy, criticized Trump for not understanding the trans-Pacific trade deal, even as Trump attacked it.      The race’s other front-runner, Carson, had a relatively quiet debate again. But quiet debates have not hurt him so far.      “Thank you for not asking me what I said in the 10th grade. I appreciate that,” Carson said, after moderators made reference to questions raised about his telling of his life story. “I have no problem with being vetted. What I do have a problem with is being lied about. And putting that out there as truth.”      Both Paul and former Florida governor Jeb Bush had strong debates, interjecting themselves into ongoing arguments in a way they hadn’t before. But for both, there is no guarantee that a good debate will revive fortunes that have been sagging for months.      The Republican field split sharply on the question of how to handle the Islamic State and Russia, with Trump calling for the United States to stay out of more confrontations – and other candidates blasting him for advocating showing weakness.      “If Putin wants to go and knock the hell out of ISIS, I am all for it,” Trump said, noting that he had met Russian President Vladimir Putin through a “60 Minutes” episode. Trump expressed weariness about the troubles U.S. interventions had run into in Iraq and Libya. He also said the United States should not get involved militarily against the Islamic State, and instead let other countries in the region take the lead. “They say, ‘Keep going. Keep going, you dummies,’ ” Trump said. “We can’t continue to be the policeman of the world.”      Bush responded that Trump was misunderstanding how both Putin and the Islamic State see the world. “That’s like a board game. That’s like playing monopoly, that’s not how the world works,” he said.      That set off one of the most substantive exchanges of any Republican debate so far, which demonstrated a broad disagreement within the Republican field. Fiorina was among those calling for a more aggressive foreign policy, using both troops and diplomatic rebukes. She stepped in to criticize Trump for being naïve about the danger Putin posed, and said she herself would not talk to Putin right away. Although she said she had met him before: “Not in a green room for a show, but for a private meeting.”      Later, Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) and Kasich sparred about what they would have done if faced with the possibility that an enormous bank would fail. Cruz said he would not bail out the banks, as the federal government did during the financial crisis that began in 2008. Kasich said Cruz was showing he wasn’t ready to be an executive.      “When a bank is ready to go under, and depositors are ready to lose their life savings, you just don’t say, ‘We believe in philosophical concerns,’ ” Kasich said. He continued: “I’ve got to tell you, on-the-job training for president of the United States doesn’t work” – a jab that Cruz was as unprepared for the job as President Obama had been in 2009.      Cruz saw an opening. “So you would bail them out?” he said. That was a hard question for Kasich, since the bailout is deeply unpopular among many fiscal conservatives.      Kasich responded with a relatively vague promise to work out a plan, rather than simply repeating the same bailout that occurred back then. “You’ve got to deal with it. You can’t turn a blind eye to it,” Kasich said.      In general, Tuesday’s debate was one of the most lively and substantive of the primary season so far, with candidates delving deeply into their plans for taxes and spending. Moderators seemed in command of the facts behind their questions, and allowed arguments to run on – at one point, a moderator ignored the network’s own go-to-commercial music so that a back-and-forth could continue. The night’s main debate also featured standout performances by two candidates who sorely needed them: Bush and Paul. Some of the more prominent candidates in the polls took a back seat: Trump and Carson played minor roles, Rubio found himself on the defensive, and Cruz stayed out of the major back-and-forths.      Cruz’s most memorable moment might have been a mistake, in which he veered close to the error that undid fellow Texan Rick Perry in 2011. Cruz said he planned to cut five major agencies: the Departments of Commerce and Energy, the IRS, the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Commerce was in there twice, but nobody called him on it.      Earlier in the evening, Paul had attacked Rubio as a big spender who would put the country deeper into debt with new benefits and military spending, in one of the sharpest moments of the debate.      Paul, who had been largely invisible in the debates up to that point, suddenly took on Rubio, saying that when he added up Rubio’s tax plan and his military plans, “You get something that looks to me not very conservative.”      Rubio, whose best moment in these debates was a comeback, replied with an attack on Paul’s national security record.      “I know that Rand is a committed isolationist,” he said. “I’m not.”      Paul continued on the attack, casting himself in a role that he had seemed reluctant to play in the past. He was the one Republican who would argue that the U.S. could possibly spend too much on national defense.      “Can you be a conservative, and be liberal on military spending?” he asked.      Kasich, one of the lower-polling candidates on the main stage in the fourth Republican debate, also attacked Trump for advancing a “silly argument” about deporting 11 million illegal immigrants.      “Come on, folks, we all know you can’t pick them up and ship them back across the border. It’s a silly argument. It’s not an adult argument,” Kasich said, in one of the most direct challenges to Trump in this debate so far.      Trump responded by citing deportations – done on a smaller scale – under Dwight D. Eisenhower in the 1950s. “We have no choice,” Trump said. “We have no choice.”      When Kasich continued to press Trump, the billionaire responded with disdain: Trump said he runs a huge company. “I don’t have to hear from this man. Believe me,” he said. The crowd in the audience booed – showing a kind of disapproval that past debate crowds had usually reserved for the moderators.      Bush also rejected Trump’s call for deportations, saying it hurt the party’s ability to reach out to mainstream audiences: “They’re doing high-fives in the Clinton campaign right now when they hear this.”      Immigration was a dominant issue in the early going of the debate. Cruz jumped in to oppose Bush’s plan, calling it “amnesty.” He joked that party elites and the mainstream media were easy on Bush because they don’t feel the economic threat that immigrants pose to working-class Americans. If people were coming across the Rio Grande with journalism degrees, Cruz said, the American media would suddenly see immigration as a major problem.      The debate began shortly after 9 p.m. with three candidates saying they oppose efforts to raise the minimum wage because they believe it would hurt low-wage workers more than it would help them.      “There is nothing that we do now to win. We don’t win anymore. … Taxes too high. Wages too high,” said Trump, adding that making the wage too high would hurt America’s ability to compete with overseas manufacturers. “I hate to say it, but we have to leave it the way it is.”      “Every time we raise the minimum wage, the number of jobless people increases,” Carson said, saying the effect was particularly noticeable among African Americans.      “If you raise the minimum wage, you’re going to make people more expensive than a machine,” Rubio said.      In the early minutes of the debate, one voice missing was that of Bush, the former front-runner. At one point, he cut off Kasich, who seemed to be interrupting a question meant for Bush.      “You’ve already made two comments, John,” Bush said. “I got about four minutes last debate, I’m going to get my question this time.”      Bush then spoke about his desire to undo federal regulations, and blasted President Obama’s handling of the economy. “Hillary Clinton has said that Barack Obama’s policies get an A. Really?” Bush said, taking an aggressive tone, and focusing – unlike last time – on the leading Democrat in the race, not other Republicans. “It may be the best that Hillary Clinton can do. But it’s not the best that America can do.”      Earlier in the evening, four lower-performing candidates met in the fourth “undercard” debate.      [Live updates: Republican presidential debate]      The earlier contest was dominated by a running argument between two low-performing candidates with vastly different plans to succeed. One was New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who is aiming to attract moderate voters, and the other was Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal – who is trying to convince conservatives that moderates like Christie are untrustworthy sellouts.      Jindal, now consigned to the low-performers’ debate for the fourth time, was on the attack from the beginning of the debate. Christie, just relegated from the main stage, was an uncooperative target. Jindal repeatedly zinged Christie for being a “big-government Republican,” and at one point said he should get a “juice box” for participation in the conservative movement.      Christie, showing an uncharacteristic discipline in the face of annoyance, repeatedly said he was more interested in beating Hillary Clinton than in battling with Jindal. Christie – a former federal prosecutor – used the verb “prosecute” repeatedly when describing how he could debate Clinton in the general election. “You need someone who’s going to stand up on that stage and prosecute the case against her,” he said. Christie also made an appeal to law enforcement officers, saying he would support them more than President Obama had in the roiling debate over police shootings and police brutality.      “I will have your back,” Christie said.      Christie also ended on a note of bipartisan hopes: “I will go to Washington. ... To bring this entire country together for a better future for our children and grandchildren.”      The other two candidates on stage had less air time but still managed memorable moments. Former senator Rick Santorum (Pa.), describing his grudging admiration for hardball tactics employed by Democrats, shouted out the words “They fight!” It was the loudest moment of the night, though an odd message to leave people with.      Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, who’s also been relegated from the main stage, once again defended federal “entitlement” programs like Medicare and Social Security, saying that Americans had paid into those programs and deserved to have them pay out. His most memorable moment, however, was a joke. When asked about Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, Huckabee responded like the folksy preacher he used to be: “Well, my wife’s name’s Janet. When you say Janet yellin’, I’m very familiar with what you mean.”      At various points, Jindal called out Cruz – though not by name – as all talk and no action. He called out Huckabee for being a big spender. And he zinged Christie, who had been the dominant figure in the debate’s first half, for doing too little to cut state spending.      “Let’s not be a second liberal party,” Jindal said, talking about Christie. “Let’s just not beat Hillary. Let’s elect a conservative to the White House, not just any Republican.”      Christie, for his part, did not rise to Jindal’s bait. Instead, he repeatedly cast himself as somebody who could appeal to moderates and win in blue states.      The most memorable moment for Santorum came when he tried to play off Jindal and Christie’s tension. He noted that one man claimed to be a true conservative, and the other said he could win in a blue state. Santorum raised his arms in a “Why not me?” gesture, a funny moment that indicated that he thought he combined both qualities.      Christie and Huckabee also spent time attacking the IRS and blaming the federal tax code for weakening manufacturing and America generally.      “First, make the tax code fairer, flatter and simpler,” said Christie. He described making the U.S. tax code so simple that individuals could file their taxes in 15 minutes. “I’ll be able to fire a whole bunch of IRS agents once we do that,” Christie said.      Huckabee went Christie one better and said that he’d eliminate the income tax entirely, and move to a “Fair tax,” essentially a national retail sales tax.      “We get rid of the IRS. We completely eliminate it. Because the government has no business knowing how much money we make, and how we make it ... that’s none of their business,” Huckabee said.      Huckabee and Christie were dismissed from the main debate stage after not reaching the 2.5 percent threshold in national polls. They joined Jindal and Santorum, who have been in the low-performers’ debate all along.      Two other candidates — former New York governor George Pataki and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) — were bumped from the undercard entirely after failing to reach a lower threshold of 1 percent in national polls. (Former Virginia governor Jim Gilmore, who appeared in the first undercard but not the next two, will again be kept off the stage because of low numbers). Graham, with a folksy charm and an aggressive call for greater military intervention, had been the dominant candidate in both of the last two undercards. It was not enough to raise his poll standing.      [Ben Carson is still the most popular presidential candidate. And it’s not close.]      These debates come just 13 days after the last Republican debates, which were widely perceived as a disaster for their hosts at CNBC. Both the crowd and the candidates attacked the moderators for asking argumentative questions, and the moderators let the candidates get away with blatant dodging of the truth. Trump, for instance, claimed he hadn’t said something that was included in his own immigration policy paper. The moderator, who had been right, apologized.      Tuesday night’s main event was moderated by Fox Business personalities Maria Bartiromo and Neil Cavuto. In an interview with The Washington Post, they said they aimed to do better — and that they wouldn’t put up with whining.      “I understand candidates getting annoyed, but they better be careful about looking like whiners and babies. I see this on the right and the left. I think you can ask very tough questions without coming off like an ass,” Cavuto said in an interview with Callum Borchers of The Fix. “I think it’s incumbent on us to know and appreciate the difference.”      Ahead of the debate, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus sent a letter to RNC members saying the committee has “worked tirelessly” with Fox to “fine-tune our debate process and ensure that our candidates have the best format and experience.”      “I am confident that we will finally have a debate focused on the economy and financial matters. The moderators tonight have also pledged to allow candidates 90 seconds to answer questions, rather than 60 seconds in past debates, as well as give each candidate a closing statement,” Priebus says in the letter, which was shared with The Washington Post by a Republican recipient.      Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton issued a prebuttal ahead of the debate in the form of an Internet video that accused Bush, Rubio and Trump of backing tax plans that disproportionately benefit the wealthy.      The last debate was a breakout moment for Rubio. He was attacked by Bush — an old ally of Rubio’s from their days in Florida politics — for missing many votes in the Senate.      Rubio responded with a deeply stinging cut-down: “The only reason why you’re doing [this] now is because we’re running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.”      Sean Sullivan, Jenna Johnson in Springfield, Ill., Philip Rucker in St. Francis, Wis., and Robert Costa in Milwaukee contributed to this report. ||||| Donald Trump speaks as Ben Carson watches during Republican presidential debate at Milwaukee Theatre. Debate Night The 11 most explosive moments of the GOP debate      The Fox Business News moderators are keeping themselves out of the crosshairs, but the Republican debate on Tuesday night still had plenty of memorable moments. Below are some of the best:      1. Trump’s back.      Story Continued Below      After a low-energy performance in the last debate, Trump came out punching and wisecracking on Tuesday night.      After John Kasich called Trump's plan to deport millions of undocumented immigrants \\"silly,\\" Trump responded.      \\"You’re lucky in Ohio that you struck oil,\\" Trump told him and cited the precedent of a mass deportation from the 1950s. “Dwight Eisenhower. You don’t get nicer, you don’t get friendlier. They moved a million and a half people out.”      Kasich cut back in, over the objections of a moderator, telling him, “You're not going to have my back, I’m going to have my back.\\"      “You should let Jeb speak,\\" cracked Trump, referring to a moment minutes earlier when Kasich cut off Jeb Bush.      Bush jumped in with sarcasm: “Thank you Donald Trump for letting me speak.\\"            2. Jeb stands his ground.      Kasich began to cut in as Bush was being asked a question.      Bush: “You’ve already made your comment, it’s my turn, John … I got about four minutes last debate – I’m gonna get my question now.”      Kasich: “I appreciate it Jeb, I’m all for you.” Kasich continues to talk about his tax plan.            3. Carson pivots from a question about his biography to... Benghazi.      Neil Cavuto asked Ben Carson to address scrutiny of his version of his life story.      Carson: “First of all thank you for not asking me what I said in 10th grade, I appreciate that.” The crowd laughed.      Cavuto: “I’ll just forget about that follow-up then.\\"      Carson: \\"When I look at somebody like Hillary Clinton who sits there and tells her daughter and a government official that no this was a terrorist attack and tells everybody else it was a video, where I come from, they call that a lie,\\" Carson said, to cheers in the audience. \\"I think that’s very different from somebody misinterpreting when I said I was offered a scholarship to West Point ... People who know me know that I’m a honest person.\\"            4. Trump \\"meets\\" Putin, slaps down Bush; Fiorina jumps in.      Asked about how he would handle his relationship with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, Trump responded, \\"I got to know him very well because we were both on 60 minutes the other night.\\" (They didn't actually meet.)      Bush attempted to butt in as Trump said he was happy to let let Putin intervene in Syria. Trump waved his hand at Bush and told him, \\"Wait a minute.” Bush kept trying and Trump repeated, \\"Wait a minute.\\"      After Trump finished, Bush said: “Donald is wrong on this.

Rubio takes on Big Philosophy.      Marco Rubio said Americans should stop stigmatizing vocational education: “Welders make more money than philosophers. We need more welders and less philosophers.\\" The crowd cheered.            7. Rubio vs. Paul.      Rand Paul called into question the conservative credibility of Rubio's tax reform plan, which included tax credits.      Rubio butted in over the objections of a moderator: “I get my 60 seconds to respond, he just talked about tax plan.”      Rubio defended his tax credits and his plan to increase military spending. “I know that Rand is a committed isolationist. I’m not. I believe the world is a safer and a better place when the United States is the strongest country in the world.” The crowd applauded.      Paul fired back: “You cannot be a conservative if you're going to keep promoting programs that you're not going to pay for.”      Rubio reiterated: “I know that the world is a safer and a better place when the United States is the strongest country in the world.”            8. Paul’s commercial break false start.      Trump pivoted a discussion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership to a discussion of China’s currency manipulation: “If you look at the way that China and India and almost everybody takes advantage of the United States. China in particular because they’re so good at it … Currency manipulation is the single greatest weapon people have.”      Paul chimed in, telling the Wall Street Journal editor Gerard Baker: “Hey Gerard we might want to point out China’s not part of this deal.”      Baker entertained Paul’s point and talked over the music signaling the beginning of a commercial break.      Paul started speaking, over the music, about trade policy. “I think it’s a mistake when we give up power to the presidency on these trade deals … Over the last century really so much power has gravitated to the executive branch.”      The music stopped, Paul wrapped up his answer, the music returned, and Fox Business successfully made it into the break.      9. He means Risk.      \\"We are not going to be the world’s policemen but we sure as hell better be the world’s leader.

Kasich rebuked Ted Cruz for saying that he would let Bank of America go bankrupt rather than bail it out.      Cruz: “What would you do if the bank was failing?”      Kasich: “I would not let the people who put their money in there all go down … I would figure out how to separate out hard-working people and those who could afford to lose.” Crowd boos.      11. Maria Bartiromo says something nice about Hillary Clinton, and gets booed.      Bartiromo, referring to Clinton: “You will be facing a candidate with an impressive resume.” The crowd booed loudly.

Pick your answer from:  (a). freeze a spoon and then hold it under your eye for twenty minutes.  (b). put concealer over them.","output":"To determine the better solution for getting rid of bags under your eyes, I will analyze both options and their effectiveness in addressing the problem. Option (a): Freeze a spoon and then hold it under your eye for twenty minutes.  This method can provide a quick, temporary relief by tightening the skin and reducing puffiness around the eyes. The cold temperature from the spoon constricts the blood vessels and reduces swelling. However, it may not completely eliminate the appearance of dark circles or bags, and the effects are short-lived. Option (b): Put concealer over them. Using concealer is a cosmetic solution to hide the appearance of bags and dark circles instantly. When applied properly, this method can provide a natural-looking coverage that can last for several hours. However, it does not address the underlying cause of the problem and is only a temporary fix. Analysis: Option (a) provides temporary relief and addresses the issue of puffiness, while option (b) effectively hides the appearance of bags. Considering the goal is to \\"get rid of bags under your eyes,\\" neither solution is perfect, but each one offers a different approach in addressing the problem to varying degrees. Conclusion: Since the goal is to get rid of the appearance of bags under the eyes, I would choose option (b) as the better solution.

There are very important differences between the teacher's work and the actor's. The actor has to speak words which he has learnt by heart; he has to repeat exactly the same words each time he plays a certain part, even his movements and the ways in which he uses his voice are usually fixed beforehand .What he has to do is to make all these carefully learnt words and actions seem natural on the stage. A good teacher works in quite a different way. His audience take an active part in his play: they ask and answer questions, they obey orders, and if they don't understand anything, they say so. The teacher can't learn his part by heart, but must invent it as he goes along.

The answer to the question: Whose palace was El Greco obliged to leave? is inside the article: By the time El Greco arrived in Rome, Michelangelo and Raphael were dead, but their example continued to be paramount, and somewhat overwhelming for young painters. El Greco was determined to make his own mark in Rome defending his personal artistic views, ideas and style. He singled out Correggio and Parmigianino for particular praise, but he did not hesitate to dismiss Michelangelo's Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel; he extended an offer to Pope Pius V to paint over the whole work in accord with the new and stricter Catholic thinking. When he was later asked what he thought about Michelangelo, El Greco replied that \\"he was a good man, but he did not know how to paint\\". And thus we are confronted by a paradox: El Greco is said to have reacted most strongly or even condemned Michelangelo, but found it impossible to withstand his influence. Michelangelo's influence can be seen in later El Greco works such as the Allegory of the Holy League. By painting portraits of Michelangelo, Titian, Clovio and, presumably, Raphael in one of his works (The Purification of the Temple), El Greco not only expressed his gratitude but also advanced the claim to rival these masters. As his own commentaries indicate, El Greco viewed Titian, Michelangelo and Raphael as models to emulate. In his 17th century Chronicles, Giulio Mancini included El Greco among the painters who had initiated, in various ways, a re-evaluation of Michelangelo's teachings.Because of his unconventional artistic beliefs (such as his dismissal of Michelangelo's technique) and personality, El Greco soon acquired enemies in Rome. Architect and writer Pirro Ligorio called him a \\"foolish foreigner\\", and newly discovered archival material reveals a skirmish with Farnese, who obliged the young artist to leave his palace. On 6 July 1572, El Greco officially complained about this event. A few months later, on 18 September 1572, he paid his dues to the Guild of Saint Luke in Rome as a miniature painter. At the end of that year, El Greco opened his own workshop and..., can you guess it ?

California triplets at center of thorny surrogacy case, pro-life debate A set of newborn triplets are now being tended to in a California hospital, unaware of their place at the center of a complex legal battle that could have huge implications for surrogacy and parental rights. The babies were delivered several weeks premature Monday night, according to a lawyer for Melissa Cook, the 47-year-old surrogate mother from Woodland Hills who refused the biological father’s demands that she have an abortion. That man, a deaf, 50-year-old postal worker from Georgia identified in court papers as “C.M.,” paid Cook to carry anonymously donated eggs he fertilized in the hopes of having children. But Cook, who describes herself as pro-life, refused to have an abortion, and is seeking parental rights. \\"I'm healthy, I'm 28 weeks pregnant, the babies are doing great, the three little boys I have inside me,\\" Cook told Fox News outside court earlier this month before they were born. \\"You can doctor this up, you can play word games with it, but this is simply and purely the sale of a child.\\" - Harold Cassidy, attorney for surrogate mom In California, a gestational surrogate – a woman who carries a donor’s eggs - has no parental rights, but Cook is challenging the state's surrogacy law in federal court, claiming it is unconstitutional. \\"It's an attempt to reduce women to an object, or a breeding animal,\\" charges Cook's lawyer, Harold Cassidy, a nationally prominent pro-life and anti-surrogacy lawyer who is calling for a moratorium on surrogacy. \\"You can doctor this up, you can play word games with it, but this is simply and purely the sale of a child,\\" he added. Cassidy told Fox News that the minute the babies were born, they were immediately taken from Cook because a state court judge had granted the father parental rights, a ruling Cassidy is appealing. \\"The hospital personnel refused to let Melissa see the children, allow her to know what their condition is, refused to tell her their exact weights, and she is not being permitted to see the children at all,\\" Cassidy said. \\"We have a mother who loves them, who fought for them, who defended their life, who stands ready to take care of them. You can't tell a mother who gives birth to children that what happens to the children is none of her business.\\" Court documents reveal correspondence involving Cook and C.M., including a Sept. 18, 2015 message the father wrote to his attorney to say visits to a fertility clinic by Cook, whose pregnancy was deemed high-risk due to her age, were \\"draining my finances.\\" \\"I do not want to abort twin babies, but I felt that is such possible (sic) to seek aborting all three babies,” he wrote. “I do not want to affect Melissa’s health. I do not have any more money in the bank, and my job does not pay great bi-weekly.\\" Cook’s lawsuit says that, “C.M. depleted his life savings paying for the infertility doctors, paying the surrogacy broker, paying the anonymous ova donor, paying the lawyers and putting money into trust for the surrogate,\\" prompting “his demand that Melissa have an abortion because he could not financially afford the children and was otherwise incapable of raising the children.\\" Surrogacy contracts typically allow for what is known “selective reduction,” where an embryo or fetus can be aborted, usually for medical reasons. The contract in this case was not made available to Fox News. Last Nov. 24, according to the lawsuit, C.M. wrote: \\"My decision made is, requires a selection reduction (sic). I am so sorry.\\" Cook, who was hired through Santa Barbara-based Surrogacy International, claims that she was threatened with legal and financial damages if she refused to undergo the procedure. Robert Walmsley, co-owner of Surrogacy International, which is not named in the federal lawsuit, has reportedly said that Cook was asked to only abort one fetus because doctors were concerned about possible abnormalities. Walmsley, who is also C.M.’s lawyer, declined an interview request from Fox News, citing his client's and Cook's privacy. He issued a statement on behalf of C.M. in which the biological father vowed not to discuss the case publicly out of concern for parties involved, including the three children. C.M. said in the statement he thinks it would be inappropriate to discuss the issues “outside the judicial process.” \\"There have been many misrepresentations made about this matter,” the statement read in part. “I have addressed those misrepresentations in the appropriate forum -the judicial system -and the appropriate Court has heard both sides and issued a correct ruling based on California law and any constitutional issues that there may be. I stand by the Court's ruling. \\"My interest is in protecting my three children,” the statement added. “I continue to have concern for the health and welfare of the surrogate and wish to avoid her having unnecessary stress through a public presentation. I have no interest in sensationalizing the situation.\\" Cassidy has spent decades challenging abortion and surrogacy laws across the country. He represented surrogate mother Mary Beth Whitehead, in the landmark 1987 New Jersey court case known as \\"Baby M,\\" which ultimately invalidated surrogacy laws in that state. Whitehead had been inseminated with the sperm of the intended father, but then refused to give up the infant. The parents, William and Elizabeth Stern, were given custody of the baby girl and Whitehead was granted visiting rights. \\"Baby M\\" grew up to be the now 29-year-old Melissa Stern, who is married with her own children. According to the Creative Family Connections law firm in Maryland, 33 states allow some form of surrogacy, and the practice has given countless parents children. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine estimates that about 1,600 babies are born each year in the United States through gestational surrogacy, such as Cook's. But Cassidy notes that surrogacy has been outlawed in most of Europe and Canada. While he acknowledges the blessings of the results for many desperate parents, he believes that \\"the focus is wrong\\" and belongs on the children. \\"Some man who donates sperm on the other side of the country is a stranger to that child, so much so that it is nothing for him to demand that the mother who loves the children he's carrying has to kill one of them,” he said. “So his focus was not on the children, his focus was on what he wanted, what he could do, what he was capable of without any regard for what's best for the children. And quite frankly, for a state to pass a statute that says the children should be turned over to someone who admits that he cannot care for the children is not good at all, and by the way, the way it's written, it is not constitutional.\\" This is the second time that Cook served as a surrogate mother, she did so three years ago. She is seeking in court to be declared the legal mother of the infants, and Cassidy says that she is prepared to care for one or all of the babies if C.M., the father, cannot. \\"I want what's best for them,\\" Cook said outside court on Feb. 8. \\"These court proceedings are for them, to determine what is going to be in their best interest.\\" The Los Angeles County Health Department, which is named in the federal suit, did not respond to Fox News' request for comment.

The northern English town of Manchester was under siege; Old Trafford was under siege. With each bomb that fell upon the old stadium -- home to one of the world's most iconic clubs Manchester Untied -- a piece of James Gibson's heart was shattered. The man who had built United up from financial ruin was left facing the destruction of a decade of hard work. The grandstand was obliterated, the stadium left for ruin like an ancient battleground. This was not the Theatre of Dreams, but the Theatre of Shattered Dreams.

After the devastating air raids, Gibson, with his unyielding determination, began to focus his efforts on rebuilding and seeking out fresh talents to carry Manchester United toward a brighter future. He recognized the importance of investing in youth and nurturing local talents, giving them the opportunity to rise through the ranks of the club. As this new strategy unfolded, significant attention was paid to the scouting system, which grew increasingly sophisticated and competitive. Scouts were dispatched to comb local neighborhoods, schools, and amateur clubs throughout the region, identifying promising players and offering them the chance to join United's burgeoning youth system. This forward-thinking approach to recruitment yielded undeniable results. In 1945, just four years after the dark days of the bombings, a promising young manager named Matt Busby took the reins at Manchester United. Busby shared Gibson's vision for nurturing local talent, cultivating a deep-rooted sense of loyalty and camaraderie within the team. Together, they implemented a philosophy that placed emphasis on the creative freedom and harmony of the players on the pitch, while also fostering a sense of unity and community among the squad. This nurturing environment allowed young talents to develop their skills and reach their full potential, ultimately resulting in what came to be known as the \\"Busby Babes.\\" The Busby Babes, comprised mostly of local talents, went on to achieve remarkable success between 1945 and 1958, including winning the First Division title in 1952 and consecutive titles in 1956 and 1957. Tragically, the Munich air disaster in 1958 claimed the lives of many talented players. Nevertheless, Busby rebuilt the team once again, and under his guidance, Manchester United became the first English club to win the European Cup in 1968. James Gibson's determination to find talent within the local area indeed played a crucial role in shaping Manchester United's future successes. By focusing on nurturing homegrown players, Gibson and Busby were able to create a legacy that not only brought glory to Old Trafford but also demonstrated the power of perseverance, hard work, and the indomitable human spirit. The Theatre of Shattered Dreams slowly transformed back into the Theatre of Dreams, and Manchester United found its way back to greatness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He became a priority signing for Koeman as doubts persist over the future of fellow midfielder Ross Barkley, 23, who has been told he will be sold if he fails to sign a new contract at Goodison Park. Klaassen added: \\"The moment that I spoke with the manager directly I got a good feeling.

Please answer the following question: Lung cancer is most often caused by exposure to tobacco smoke, and tobacco is smoked in pipes or in cigarettes or bidis. Given these facts, what causes lung cancer among the following options: - Pollution  - smoking salmon  - burning  - cigarettes  - gasoline  - lung tissue  - heating liquids  - respiration A:","output":"Lung cancer, a malignant tumor that develops in the cells of the lung, is majorly caused by exposure to tobacco smoke. Among the options provided, cigarettes are the primary source of lung cancer. Smoking cigarettes, bidis, or pipes introduces harmful chemicals, such as carcinogens, into the lungs. These chemicals damage the lung cells, and over time, the damaged cells can turn into cancerous cells, leading to lung cancer. Although pollution and burning are not the primary causes of lung cancer, they can contribute to an increased risk of developing it. Air pollution, especially in urban areas, contains tiny particles called particulate matter (PM) that are known to have harmful effects on the lungs and can contribute to the development of lung cancer. Burning materials, such as wood, coal, or other organic materials, also release harmful particles and chemicals into the air, which can be inhaled and contribute to lung cancer risk. Gasoline is mainly associated with the release of benzene, a type of hydrocarbon related to an increased risk of leukemia, rather than lung cancer. However, inhaling fumes from gasoline may contribute to respiratory problems and other health issues. Smoking salmon, heating liquids, lung tissue, and respiration are not directly associated with the development of lung cancer. Smoking salmon refers to a cooking method, and it does not release harmful carcinogens into the lungs. Heating liquids, in general, does not emit hazardous particles that could cause lung cancer. Lung tissue is the part of the anatomy where lung cancer develops. Respiration is the process of inhaling and exhaling air, and while it may be impacted by lung cancer, it is not a direct cause. In conclusion, among the provided options, cigarettes are the main cause of lung cancer due to the harmful chemicals found in tobacco smoke. Other factors, such as air pollution and burning materials, may contribute to an increased risk of lung cancer. However, smoking salmon, heating liquids, lung tissue, and respiration hold no significant association with lung cancer development."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Swansea midfielder Pablo Hernandez is the subject of a £4million bid from Al Arabi in Qatar. The club is managed by former Chelsea defender Dan Petrescu who has also tried to sign Xavi Hernandez from Barcelona. Swansea paid £5.5million for Pablo Hernandez two seasons ago and may struggle to get that money back but he is 29 now and that may be the best offer they get. The Spaniard held talks in the Middle East last week and is eager to sign up with other members of Swansea's Spanish contingent also being targeted by Qatari clubs. VIDEO Scroll down for Pablo drives a pink Suzuki after losing crossbar challenge","output":"Swansea City is likely to accept a £4 million bid from Qatari club Al Arabi for Spanish midfielder Pablo Hernandez, as the 29-year-old looks to continue his career in the Middle East. Al Arabi is managed by former Chelsea defender Dan Petrescu, who had previously made attempts to sign another Spanish star, Xavi Hernandez, from Barcelona. Despite having paid £5.5 million for Hernandez two seasons ago, Swansea may consider letting go of the experienced midfielder as he approaches the end of his career and the offered amount could be the best available for the Welsh club. Pablo Hernandez's eagerness to join Al Arabi came to light following his trip to the Middle East last week, where he reportedly held positive talks with representatives from the Qatari club. It is believed that the playmaker is excited about the prospect of working under the guidance of Dan Petrescu, who has experience playing in the Premier League and could provide valuable insights into the game. Speculation is also rife about the future of other Spanish players in Swansea's ranks, with multiple reports suggesting that Qatari clubs have been keeping tabs on the team's Spanish contingent. This potential exodus could prompt a significant reshuffling of the squad, as the Swans may need to explore the transfer market for suitable replacements before the start of the new season. Moreover, adapting to this change could prove challenging for Swansea City, as the club would need to discover and integrate quality players into an already competitive environment. However, the £4 million offer for Hernandez could be channeled towards acquiring promising talents, allowing the team to invest in their future and cover the possible exits of the Spanish stars. In conclusion, the most logical completion of this news story would be Swansea City accepting the £4 million bid from Al Arabi for Pablo Hernandez, given his age and the difficulties of finding a better value in the current market. The move could set off a potential chain reaction, with other members of Swansea's Spanish contingent switching to Qatari clubs, prompting the need for a squad reshuffling at the Welsh outfit. As Swansea looks to remain competitive in the Premier League, the new signings could play a crucial role in determining their success in the upcoming season."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the title of Nielsen's third cantata?  Nielsen's two operas are very different in style. The four-act Saul og David (Saul and David), written in 1902 to a libretto by Einar Christiansen, tells the Biblical story of Saul's jealousy of the young David while Maskarade (Masquerade) is a comic opera in three acts written in 1906 to a Danish libretto by Vilhelm Andersen, based on the comedy by Ludvig Holberg. Saul and David received a negative press when it was premiered in November 1902 and did no better when it was revived in 1904. By contrast, in November 1906 Masquerade was a resounding success with an exceptional run of 25 performances over its first four months. Generally considered to be Denmark's national opera, in its home country it has enjoyed lasting success and popularity, attributable to its many strophic songs, its dances and its underlying \\"old Copenhagen\\" atmosphere.Nielsen wrote a considerable number of choral works but most of them were composed for special occasions and were seldom reprised. Three fully-fledged cantatas for soloists, orchestra and choir have, however, entered the repertoire. Nielsen composed Hymnus amoris (Hymn of Love), Op. 12 (1897) after studying early polyphonic choral style.  Writing in the newspaper Dannebrog, Nanna Liebmann referred to the work as \\"a decisive victory\\" for Nielsen, and Angul Hammerich of Nationaltidende welcomed its improved clarity and purity. But the Berlingske Tidende reviewer H.W. Schytte thought Nielsen had been pretentious presenting the lyrics in Latin rather than Danish. Søvnen (The Sleep), Op. 18, Nielsen's second major choral work, sets to music the various phases of sleep including the terror of a nightmare in its central movement which, with its unusual discords, came as a shock to the reviewers at its premiere in March 1905. Fynsk Foraar (Springtime on Funen), Op. 42, completed in 1922, has been cited as the most Danish of all Nielsen's compositions as it extols the beauty of Funen's countryside.

Born and raised in Springfield, Massachusetts, by French-Canadian immigrant parents, Gravel served in the U.S. Army in West Germany, and he later graduated from the Columbia University School of General Studies. He moved to Alaska in the late 1950s, becoming a real estate developer and entering politics. He served in the Alaska House of Representatives from 1963 to 1966 and also became Speaker of the Alaska House. Gravel \\"decided to become a pioneer in a faraway place,\\" and moved to pre-statehood Alaska in August 1956, without funds or a job, looking for a place where someone without social or political connections could be a viable candidate for public office. Alaska's voting age of 19, less than most other states' 21, played a role in his decision, as did its newness and cooler climate. Broke when he arrived, he immediately found work in real estate sales until winter arrived. Gravel then was employed as a brakeman for the Alaska Railroad, working the snow-clearing train on the Anchorage-Fairbanks run. Subsequently, he opened a small real estate brokerage in Anchorage (the Territory of Alaska not requiring a license) and saved enough so as not to have to work the railroad again. Gravel joined the Anchorage Unitarian Universalist Fellowship, and continued a sporadic relationship with the movement throughout his life.  Gravel married Rita Jeannette Martin, who had been Anchorage's \\"Miss Fur Rendezvous\\" of 1958, on April 29, 1959. They had two children, Martin Anthony Gravel and Lynne Denise Gravel, born c. 1960 and 1962 respectively.  Meanwhile, he went to Washington, D.C. in 1957 to campaign for Alaskan statehood via the \\"Tennessee Plan\\": dressed as Paul Revere, he rode with a petition to the steps of the U.S. Capitol. Seeing Alaska as a wide-open place with no political establishment or entrenched interests, and using the slogan \\"Gravel, the Roadbed to Prosperity\\", he ran for the territorial legislature in 1958 but lost. He went on a national speaking tour concerning tax reform in 1959, sponsored by the Jaycees. He ran without avail for the City Council in Anchorage in 1960. During this time, he had become a successful real estate agent; after the 1960 election, he became a property developer in a mobile home park on the outskirts of Anchorage. A partner ran into financial difficulty, however, and the project went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy and Gravel was forced out in 1962. When did he stop working the railroad?","output":"Mike Gravel stopped working the railroad after he had opened a small real estate brokerage in Anchorage and saved enough money so as not to have to work the railroad again.

Article: Every human being has a unique arrangement of the skin on his fingers and this arrangement is unchangeable. Scientists and experts have proved the uniqueness of finger-prints and discovered that no exactly similar pattern is passed on from parents to children, though nobody knows why this is the case. The ridge structure on a person's fingers does not change with growth and is not affected by surface injuries. Burns, cuts and other damage to the outer part of the skin will be replaced in time by new one which bears a reproduction of the original pattern. It is only when the inner skin is injured that the arrangement will be destroyed. Some criminals make use of this fact to remove their own finger-prints but this is a dangerous and rare step to take. Finger-prints can be made very easily with printer's ink. They can be recorded easily. With special methods, identification can be achieved successfully within a short time. Because of the simplicity and economy of this system, finger-prints have often been used as a method of solving criminal case. A suspected man may deny a charge but this may be in vain. His finger-prints can prove who he is even if his appearance has been changed by age or accident. When a suspect leaves finger-prints behind at the scene of a crime, they are difficult to detect with the naked eye. Special techniques are used to \\"develop\\" them.

We have -18*f and -67*f. If we add them, we get -85*f. So the equation now looks like this: -85*f = -491 - 529. 2. Now, let's combine the numbers on the right side of the equation. We have -491 and -529. If we add these two numbers, we get -1020. Our equation now is: -85*f = -1020. 3. Next, we need to find the value of \\"f\\". To do this, we need to isolate \\"f\\" to one side of the equation. To do that, we'll divide both sides by -85 (the coefficient of the f). f = -1020 / -85  4. If we simplify, -1020 divided by -85 is equal to 12. So, f = 12. And that's it! The solution to the equation is f = 12."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I want larger class sizes","output":"Based on the preceding text, the sentence you provided, \\"I want larger class sizes,\\" does not follow logically. This is because the initial goal you mentioned was to reduce classroom size and ensure that students have more one-on-one time with teachers. Introducing larger class sizes would contradict that goal. To achieve the smaller class sizes, you have proposed the following plan: 1. Recruit 100,000 highly qualified teachers: By hiring more skilled educators, you can ensure that each classroom has fewer students assigned to each teacher. This approach makes it possible for teachers to more effectively manage their classes and provide personalized attention to each student's needs. 2. Help local school districts build new schools: Constructing additional educational facilities can help to accommodate increased staff numbers. By doing this, you can distribute students more evenly across the schools and classrooms, resulting in smaller class sizes and enhanced learning environments. Instead of advocating for larger class sizes, you may want to consider a sentence that further emphasizes your plans for reducing class sizes and improving one-on-one interactions between teachers and students.

Follow @@lauriewhitwell. Kenny Jackett sits in a sunlit meeting room at Wolverhampton Wanderers’ training ground explaining how his genial manner hides a clinical disposition. He may be nice, but he can wield a knife. This summer, as he plots a path for the club’s return to the Barclays Premier League, he has once again sliced eight players (earning a total of around £7million a year) from his squad, telling them their services will not be needed. That group, who are training separately from the first team and will not feature in pre-season games, includes Kevin Doyle, Jamie O’Hara and Roger Johnson — players with top-flight experience on seven-figure wages. It is a hardline stance but Jackett, entering his 11th consecutive year in football management, knows there can be no softening of a policy that rid the club of the toxic atmosphere caused by successive relegations and gives his team a better chance of success on the field too. VIDEO Scroll down to watch angry Wolves fans invade the pitch after losing to Burnley. They're back! Kenny Jackett guided Wolves to promotion from League One to the Championship in May. Some of the clubs who have enjoyed double success:. Watford: Div 4 to Div 2 (promoted in 77-78 & 78-79) Wimbledon FC: Div 4 to Div 2 (82-83 & 83-84) Man City: Div 2 to Premier League (1998-99 & 99-00) Hull: Div 3 to Championship (03-04 & 04-05) Norwich: League One to Premier League (09-10 & 10-11) Crawley: Conference National to League One (10-11 & 11-12) Southampton: League One to Premier League (10-11 & 11-12) Having begun the interview by offering a cup of tea, he offers his thoughts. ‘It was our ambition to only spend one year in League One. Some big clubs have stayed down for two, three, four years — both Sheffield clubs, Leeds United, Nottingham Forest. ‘I’ve seen when it’s two-and-a-half years before all those big contracts run out and you get a group of hungry young lads that nobody’s ever heard of coming through. They see the fantastic potential, the big crowds, and want to make a name for themselves. ‘What I tried to do was accelerate that process. We couldn’t drift along. We needed to have that type of turnover in one summer. I had the benefit of being a rival manager coming to Molineux. I felt the relationship between the crowd and players had broken down. Those players needed to be removed. It’s not a patient industry I’m in.’ As if to remind, a painting of a pack of wolves hangs on the wall. Harsh words can be delivered humanely, however. ‘I just tried to be as clear as I could that they weren’t in my plans,’ Jackett, 52, continues. ‘Also, I felt they would benefit from a move. There were a lot of people who’d spent a few years in the Premier League and it’s quite hard to then come down.’ He adds: ‘As manager your successful times are when you are being proactive. In many cases you have to make the calls before the mistakes happen. After that, on a human level, the one thing you need to be is straight with people, to be open and honest.’ Top of the league: Leigh Griffiths celebrates scoring as Wanderers went to the summit of the third tier. So it came to pass that only two members of the side who featured in the defeat at Brighton on the final day of the 2012-13 season — a result that underlined relegation for Wolves and saw angry exchanges between fans and players — appeared in the 6-4 win over Rotherham in April that celebrated immediate promotion back. The crowd was raucous that day, too. Homegrown players such as Danny Batth, 23, and Jack Price, 21, blossomed, while signings Michael Jacobs, 22, and James Henry, 25, proved instant hits. Bakary Sako and Nouha Dicko are the duo providing continuity. Wolves clinched the League One title with a record 103 points as Jackett implemented an attractive passing game. Win or lose, players recognised fans with applause. It wasn’t just a bloated squad Jackett trimmed for gains. The training ground canteen menu had swollen from players pushing their individual tastes. Too many cooks. Choices now are fewer and healthier but there is no Paolo Di Canio-style ban on tomato ketchup. Fading fast: Jamie O'Hara and Kevin Doyle have been training on their own during this pre-season. Confidence in youth: Jackett wants to build his side around the likes of Danny Batth. Pedigree: James Henry blossomed at Molineux after Jackett landed the former Millwall man. ‘I felt the menu was catering to too many different opinions that weren’t the experts,’ says Jackett. ‘We employ a full-time sports scientist. His job is to dictate the menu, what is eaten, when and why.’ If last season’s goals were clear — right wrongs, lift the mood, gain promotion — this season presents a more complex landscape. But Jackett has one vision. ‘It again is to try and go up,’ he says without hesitation. ‘Three lucky teams will get into the Premier League by the end of this Championship season. We want to be one of them. Wolves are big enough to be competing.’ Jackett is wise in the ways of promotion. As a member of Graham Taylor’s Watford side of the 1980s he reached the FA Cup final and was capped 31 times by Wales before retiring aged 28 after knee injuries, going into coaching early. Confrontation: Wolves supporters were upset with Doyle and Roger Johnson after relegation in 2013. In the late 1990s, as assistant to Taylor, he saw Watford into the Premier League after successive promotions then, as No 2 to Ian Holloway, helped Queens Park Rangers go up from what is now League One. As manager, he took Swansea from the bottom rung as they began their ascent up the leagues, while Millwall reached the Championship under his guidance. Wolves, though, is a chance to show his teeth. ‘Do I hope there are many more opportunities for me in the future? Yes. I suppose that will be dictated by how well I do at Wolves. I’m fully aware of the insecurities of football management. ‘I’d love to manage in the Premier League, I’d love to perhaps manage at international level. It is my ambition to go as high as I can.’ Do not discount the steel behind the smile. Write highlights for this article.","output":"1.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What does the language suggest?\\"  Context: \\"Some legal scholars, such as John Baker of LSU, theorize that Madison's initial proposed language—that Congress should make no law regarding the establishment of a \\"national religion\\"—was rejected by the House, in favor of the more general \\"religion\\" in an effort to appease the Anti-Federalists. To both the Anti-Federalists and the Federalists, the very word \\"national\\" was a cause for alarm because of the experience under the British crown. During the debate over the establishment clause, Rep. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts took issue with Madison's language regarding whether the government was a national or federal government (in which the states retained their individual sovereignty), which Baker suggests compelled Madison to withdraw his language from the debate.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"In this context, the language suggests that the change in Madison's initial proposed language concerning the establishment of a \\"national religion\\" to the more general term \\"religion\\" was an attempt to address the concerns of both Anti-Federalists and Federalists regarding the nature and scope of the federal government's power over religious matters. The word \\"national\\" was seen as alarming to both groups due to their negative experiences with the British government. The change in language aimed to appease the Anti-Federalists, who were particularly concerned about the potential for a centralized government to undermine states' rights and individual freedoms, including the right to religious liberty. By revising the language to be more general and removing the term \\"national,\\" the intent was to convey a sense of limiting the federal government's involvement in religious affairs, thus preserving the autonomy of the states and promoting religious freedom for citizens. Moreover, the debate over Madison's language, particularly the disagreement between Rep. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts and Madison, highlights the dilemma that framers of the Constitution faced when trying to balance the need for a strong federal government with the desire of states to retain their sovereignty, especially on matters of individual liberties and rights. This discussion ultimately led Madison to withdraw his language from the debate, as it became apparent that using more general terms in relation to religious establishment could help address concerns about the government's reach and authority. Overall, the language changes in the establishment clause suggest a broader context in which the drafters of the Constitution were aiming to mitigate the potential overreach of the federal government in matters of religion and individual rights, and to address the concerns of both Anti-Federalists and Federalists to reach a consensus on the issue."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The global number of poor people was estimated at 1.6 billion in 1997, which at the time, represented 29% of the world's population. As such, 71% of the world's population in 1997 were not considered impoverished, living at or above the designated poverty rate. However, it's worth noting that this percentage varies across countries and regions, as well as between urban and rural populations. Moreover, income disparities were (and remain) a relentless challenge for many nations. Regional Breakdown Analyzing the poverty landscape across different regions in 1997, the following statistics offer a snapshot of people living above the poverty line: 1. East Asia and the Pacific: The region accounted for about 15% of the world's poor, with many people concentrated in rural areas. However, rapid economic growth and urbanization powered greater opportunities for 61% of the population to live above the poverty threshold. 2. Europe and Central Asia: With the collapse of the Soviet Union, these regions struggled to redefine their economies amidst widespread unemployment and hyperinflation. Nevertheless, about 90% of the population were living above the poverty line. 3. Latin America and the Caribbean: The region's high-income inequality resulted in approximately 25% of its population living in poverty. However, a significant 75% lived above the poverty rate, fueled primarily by a strong middle class. 4. Middle East and North Africa: Consisting of a predominantly young population with challenges around employment and income stability, the region, however, had about 84% of its people living above the poverty line, primarily through international aid efforts and increased focus on education and skill development. 5. North America: With 95% of its population living above the poverty threshold, the United States and Canada's strong economies boasted low unemployment rates and a generous social safety net. 6. South Asia: Hampered by the crises in investments and limited human development resources, South Asia had 48% of its population living above the poverty line, with considerable disparities between urban and rural populations. 7. Sub-Saharan Africa: Despite concerted efforts to reduce the poverty rate, over 50% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population lived below the poverty threshold in 1997. However, about 49% were not considered impoverished, thus demonstrating an indication of progress. Conclusion In retrospect, 1997 saw an improving global economy, allowing a higher percentage of people to escape poverty and live above the poverty line. These figures highlight the importance of economic opportunity, investment, progressive policies, and social programs in eradicating poverty. Numerous strides have been made since 1997, and the global poverty rate has since further decreased. Continued initiatives in education, health care, and social protections are necessary to ensure a sustained rise above poverty, not only on a global scale but also for marginalized communities that bear the most significant burden."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Barjatya after the movie Main Prem Ki Deewani hoon, then a year back now I saw promos for Vivah which looked good. But I didn't want to waste my hard earned money watching it in cinema. When the film first came out on DVD I rented it and watched and I loved the movie and took back my words for Sooraj. I just finished watching it yesterday again and this time I thought I have to review this movie. Sooraj R. BarjatyaGot it right this time, okay I was not a huge fan of Hum App Ke Hai Kaun. But I have always loved Manie Pyar kiya, after Manie Pyar kiya to me I think Vivah is Barjatyas best work. I hardly ever cry in a movie but this movie made me feel like crying. If you have ever been in love before then there will be many moments that will touch you in this movie, the movie is just too sweet and will have you falling in love with it, my view a much underrated movie. The story of this movie you might call desi and very old times, but to me it seemed modern because the two couples which are getting an arrange marriage are aware it's an old tradition. It's done in present times, lots of people don't believe in this arrange marriage, but I do. The journey between the engagement and wedding which will always be special and this movie shows it clearly. When Prem meets Poonam for the first time, they show it how it is and that's reality and my parents where saying that's how they got married and it showed it in a way which is so real yes people the way Prem and Poonam meet in this movie is how most marriages happen. It was a very sweet, you feel nervous yet excited, the song \\"Do Ajnabe\\" shows that very well. Getting back to the story yes it's a journey which you soon get glued to between Prem and Poonam (Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao) and there families. A twist occurs in this movie which is really good, the last 30mins you all will be reaching for the tissue box. What makes this film so amazing is the chemistry between Prem and Poonam, how they fall for each other is too sweet. Simple boy and Simple Girl, when they first meet during and after the song \\"Do Anjane Ajnabe\\" It's very sweet to watch, She hardly says anything and Prem does all the talking being honest with her about his past and the girl he liked and him smoking. Then it leads on to them all having a family trip and then that's when they really do fall for each other. It makes you just want to watch the couple and watch all the sweet moments they have. Another factor is that Poonam chichi is really mean to her and you feel sorry for Poonam because she has been treated bad and makes you want to see her happy and when she finally finds happiness, you too start feeling happy with her the movie basically makes you fall in love with Poonam more then just Prem. When she finds happiness through Prem you want her to stay happy and also hope nothing goes wrong because the character is shown as a sweet simple girl. Which brings me to performances and Amrita Roa as Poonam is amazing in the movie, her best work till date you will fall in love with this innocent character and root her on to find happiness. Shahid Kapoor as Prem is amazing too, he is Poonam support in the film, he is her happiness the movie, together they share an amazing chemistry and I have never seen a cuter couple since SRK and Kajol. If Ishq Vishk didn't touch you to telling you how cute they are together this surely will. \\"Mujhe Haq hai\\" the song and before that is amazing chemistry they show. Scenes which touched me was when Prem takes Poonam to his room and shows her that's where they will be staying and he opens her up and they have a moment between them which is too sweet. Again if you have ever been in love with someone that much these scenes you can defiantly connect to. The film is just the sweetest thing you will see ever. The direction is spot on, to me a good movie is basically something that can pull me in and stop me believe for this hours what is being seen here is fake and there is a camera filing them. To me this film pulled me in and for those three hours I felt really connected to the movie. The songs you will only truly like when you have seen the movie as they are songs placed in the situation after I saw the movie I been playing the songs non stop! The music is amazing, the story is simply amazing too what more can I ask for? What I can finally say it, rarely do we get a movie that makes us feel good, this movie after you have seen it will make you feel really good and make you want to be a better person. Its basically the sweetest journey ever, its basically showing you they journey between engagement and marriage and many people say it's the bestest part of your lifeWell this movie actually shows you way do people actually say that? Why do people actually say that the journey is just that amazing! Watch this movie and you will find out why the journey is amazing!","output":"The sentiment of this review is positive.

Please answer a question about the following article about Macintosh: Intel had tried unsuccessfully to push Apple to migrate the Macintosh platform to Intel chips. Apple concluded that Intel's CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) architecture ultimately would not be able to compete against RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processors. While the Motorola 68040 offered the same features as the Intel 80486 and could on a clock-for-clock basis significantly outperform the Intel chip, the 486 had the ability to be clocked significantly faster without suffering from overheating problems, especially the clock-doubled i486DX2 which ran the CPU logic at twice the external bus speed, giving such equipped IBM compatible systems a significant performance lead over their Macintosh equivalents. Apple's product design and engineering didn't help matters as they restricted the use of the '040 to their expensive Quadras for a time while the 486 was readily available to OEMs as well as enthusiasts who put together their own machines. In late 1991, as the higher-end Macintosh desktop lineup transitioned to the '040, Apple was unable to offer the '040 in their top-of-the-line PowerBooks until early 1994 with the PowerBook 500 series, several years after the first 486-powered IBM compatible laptops hit the market which cost Apple considerable sales. In 1993 Intel rolled out the Pentium processors as the successor to the 486, while the Motorola 68050 was never released, leaving the Macintosh platform a generation behind IBM compatibles in the latest CPU technology. In 1994, Apple abandoned Motorola CPUs for the RISC PowerPC architecture developed by the AIM alliance of Apple Computer, IBM, and Motorola. The Power Macintosh line, the first to use the new chips, proved to be highly successful, with over a million PowerPC units sold in nine months. However, in the long run, spurning Intel for the PowerPC was a mistake as the commoditization of Intel-architecture chips meant Apple couldn't compete on price against \\"the Dells of the world\\". How far behind was Macintosh set back compared to the new IBM compatibles?","output":"Macintosh was set back by one generation compared to the new IBM compatibles. When Intel introduced the Pentium processors in 1993 as a successor to the 486, the Motorola 68050, which was supposed to be used in Macintosh computers, was never released.

Hypothesis: 100 or more people lost their lives in a ferry sinking.","output":"Yes, based on the provided context, we can support or accept the given hypothesis i.e., \\"100 or more people lost their lives in a ferry sinking.\\" The statement in the context mentions that the ferry sinking in the Meghna River on May 3 claimed the lives of at least 370 people.  The term \\"at least 370 people\\" means that the number of people who lost their lives is not less than 370. This count is significantly higher than the figure mentioned in the hypothesis, which makes the hypothesis valid. Therefore, it is correct to say that 100 or more people (to be more precise, at least 370 people) lost their lives in the ferry sinking. However, it is also important to acknowledge that this is quite a tragic incident, reflecting the severity of the dangers of travel by ferry, especially when all requisite safety measures are not robust enough.

Question: Process:  - Coal is burned - Sulfur in the coal combines with oxygen to form sulfur oxides - The sulfur oxides are released into the atmosphere - The sulfides combine with oxygen in the atmosphere to form sulfur trioxide - The sulfur trioxide reacts with water in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid, a very strong acid - The sulfuric acid makes the rain acidic -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is less coal available happens, how will it affect MORE acid rain.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"In the context of the given process, burning coal releases sulfur oxides into the atmosphere, which eventually leads to the formation of more acidic rain. The perturbation hypothesis poses a situation in which there is less coal available, and we are to analyze whether this scenario has an effect, either direct or indirect, on the occurrence of more acidic rain. To assess this, we should break down the chain of events and examine the interconnections involved. 1. Coal is burned: Burning of coal is the primary step in this process, which is essential for the sulfur in coal to combine with oxygen. Since the perturbation hypothesis suggests less coal availability, this could result in reduced coal burning, thus causing a direct impact on the entire process. 2. Sulfur in the coal combines with oxygen to form sulfur oxides: As there would be less coal available for combustion, the amount of sulfur released into the environment would also be comparatively lower in this scenario. This would lead to fewer sulfur oxides being produced, directly affecting the subsequent steps in the process. 3. The sulfur oxides are released into the atmosphere: Due to the reduction in coal burning and sulfur oxide generation, the quantity of sulfur oxides being released into the atmosphere would also decrease. This implies that the perturbation could have a direct bearing on the atmospheric concentration of sulfur oxides. 4. The sulfides combine with oxygen in the atmosphere to form sulfur trioxide: Since there would be less sulfur oxide released into the atmosphere in the given scenario, the reaction with oxygen to form sulfur trioxide would be hindered. This signifies a direct effect on the production of sulfur trioxide as a result of the perturbation hypothesis. 5. The sulfur trioxide reacts with water in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid: With less sulfur trioxide being produced due to the reduced availability of coal, the formation of sulfuric acid would be negatively impacted. The limited sulfur trioxide would combine with a lesser amount of water in the atmosphere, leading to a decreased formation of sulfuric acid, which is a direct effect of the perturbation. 6. The sulfuric acid makes the rain acidic: As the perturbation hypothesis results in a diminished formation of sulfuric acid, its contribution to the acidity of rain would also lessen. Consequently, the perturbation has a direct influence on the phenomenon of acid rain production. In conclusion, based on the above analysis, the perturbation hypothesis of less coal availability will have a direct effect on the entire process, potentially leading to reduced acid rain occurrences. The reduction in coal combustion would cause a decrease in sulfur oxide emissions, which in turn impacts the formation of sulfur trioxide, sulfuric acid, and ultimately, acidic rain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Year 2022 would be an interesting year when three comets would get scientists' attention - Comet A, Comet B, and Comet C. Comet A and C are very faint, but Comet B is very bright. Comet A would enter the inner solar system on February 10, 2022 and leave the inner solar system on February 20, 2022. Comet B would enter the inner solar system on February 18, 2022 and leave the inner solar system on February 26, 2022. Comet C would never enter the inner solar system.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Wich comet would not be visible to naked eyes on February 19, 2022, Comet A or Comet B?  Hint: A comet tail—and coma—are features visible in comets when they are illuminated by the Sun and may become visible from Earth when a comet passes through the inner Solar System. As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them. Separate tails are formed of dust and gases, becoming visible through different phenomena; the dust reflects sunlight directly and the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible without the aid of a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye. The answer to this question is:","output":"Comet A.  This is due to the fact that, according to the provided information, Comet A would have left the inner solar system on February 20, 2022. Therefore, it wouldn't be visible to the naked eye on February 19, 2022. However, Comet B would still be in the inner solar system at this time, so it would be visible (especially given the information that it is a bright comet). Even though it was not included in the options, it's also important to note that Comet C would not be visible at all, as it never enters the inner solar system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: Whose reception of Niecks was reportedly not merely polite but most friendly? from the following article ?  It is not clear why, in 1873, Alkan decided to emerge from his self-imposed obscurity to give a series of six Petits Concerts at the Érard piano showrooms. It may have been associated with the developing career of Delaborde, who, returning to Paris in 1867, soon became a concert fixture, including in his recitals many works by his father, and who was at the end of 1872 given the appointment that had escaped Alkan himself, Professor at the Conservatoire. The success of the Petits Concerts led to them becoming an annual event (with occasional interruptions caused by Alkan's health) until 1880 or possibly beyond. The Petits Concerts featured music not only by Alkan but of his favourite composers from Bach onwards, played on both the piano and the pédalier, and occasionally with the participation of another instrumentalist or singer. He was assisted in these concerts by his siblings, and by other musicians including Delaborde, Camille Saint-Saëns, and Auguste Franchomme.Those encountering Alkan at this phase included the young Vincent d'Indy, who recalled Alkan's \\"skinny, hooked fingers\\" playing Bach on an Érard pedal piano: \\"I listened, riveted to the spot by the expressive, crystal-clear playing.\\" Alkan later played Beethoven's Op. 110 sonata, of which d'Indy said: \\"What happened to the great Beethovenian poem ...

Hobbes also reintroduced the idea of natural law and believed that there is a natural state, which is the war of all against all, but that through reason, it is possible to formulate laws that protect people against each other.\\" The sentence seems to center around the philosophical ideas of Thomas Hobbes, a well-known English philosopher known for his work on political philosophy. Hobbes believed in the social contract theory which implies that the state does not represent the desires of a divine entity but rather it is formed by people and is a reflection of their collective choices. Hobbes is indeed known for reintroducing the concept of natural law which broadly aligns with the idea that certain rights or values are inherent by virtue of human nature and can be universally understood through human reason. The statement further alludes to Hobbes's characterization of the 'state of nature’. According to him, without a central authority to maintain law and order, humans would be in a 'war of all against all' state. In such a state, individuals would be solely guided by their irrational passions and interests leading to chaos and conflict. However, using rational understanding, individuals can understand their need for safety, peace and cooperative social relationships. Therefore, by reason, they devise social contract to create laws that safeguard their lives, establish peace, and promote cooperative social orders. Thus, the choice to obey laws is in reality a rational decision informed by self-interest. Through social cooperation, individuals agree to abide by these laws, which in turn protect them from persistent conflict and allow society to function more harmoniously."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Question: I was introduced to the amazing range of handmade products from Okoii back in July and intended to post reviews in early September; however, was struck down with a particularly potent uterine parasite that left me comatosed on the couch each evening by about 8.00pm, so blogging had to take a massive back step. Now that my energy levels are returning I though that it is about time I told you about these amazing products! Okoii products are handmade by Yoko, formally from Japan, now living in Australia. Her aim was to introduce Australian women to traditional natural ingredients from Japan and Asia that they may not previously have been aware of. Some of these ingredients have been used in Japan for upwards of 1000 years, and recently the benefits of such ingredients have been scientifically proven. When you place an order with Okoii, your products are then made by hand, one by one, so you know that they are as fresh as they can possibly be. Other than Lush' Fresh Face Masks, I can't think of any other product that would be as fresh as Okoii. I find it quite exciting to know that when I purchase a product from Okoii, that it hasn't been sitting on the shelf of a warehouse for months, slowly deteriorating. It is recommended that the products be kept in the fridge to maintain their freshness and the all come with a recommended used by date that is between 3-6 months from when it was made. The first product that I am going to introduce you to is the Luxury Rice Bran Face Soap. I decided to review this one on its own for two reasons. Firstly, it was my absolute favourite of all the Okoii products I tried; and secondly, it was actually the product that I was most fearful of trying. Why? Well, the first beauty rule that is drummed into every girls head is to NEVER USE SOAP ON YOUR FACE and I was being forced to break this rule (I am a first born goodie goodie who NEVER breaks the rules - this was tough for me to do!).

This event does not have a direct effect on the process of photosynthesis, which involves the absorption of carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight to produce glucose and oxygen. The phenomenon of bats leaving their cave is unrelated to the factors necessary for photosynthesis to occur, and therefore does not have an impact on the production of sugar and oxygen within the plants."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They help people find the animal with their strong sense of smell. 2. Sight Hounds: These are the dogs that have really good eyes. They can see animals running far away and chase after them really fast. They use their awesome eyesight to look for animals and help people catch them by running super fast.

Ossessione, adapted loosely (or if it is as loose or close to the version I saw of James M. Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice with Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange I can't be certain) by first time director Luchino Visconti, is no less outstanding with usage of mis-en-scene, music (both diegetic and non-diegetic), and the acting. I didn't know what to expect Visconti to do in his approach to the material, after seeing La Terra Trema and seeing how sometimes his political motivations snuck in a little bit. But this is a totally character and emotional based drama, bordering on melodrama (however, without the conventions that bog down lesser ones), and with the style in the finest path of the budding film-noir movement, Visconti creates a debut that's as involving as any other neo-realist film. Neo-realism, by the way, could rightfully be claimed as this being a forefather (along with De Sica's The Children Are Watching Us), which that would take shape after the war. Although love and romance is more in play here than in some of the more famous neo-realist efforts, it's dealt with in a bare-bones storytelling fashion, and it's laced with other familiar themes in neo-realism (the lower-class, death, desperation). Aside from the story, which is simply as it is described on this site, the artistry with which Visconti captures the images, and then layers them with objects (a shawl over Gino Costa's profile when in guilt), shadows and darkness that tend to overcome many of the later scenes in the film (usually over Gian and Giovanna), and the feel of the Italian streets in many of the exterior scenes. Domenico Scala and Aldo Tonti (who would lens some of Rossellini and Fellini's films) help in envisioning the look of Ossessione, which is usually moving in on a character, then pausing to read as much emotion on their faces, their voices and mannerisms lovely and ugly, sad and dark and romantic. I think I've just scratched the surface on how effective it was that the film itself was moving me along, even as I was in fear of the futures of the two leads. The two leads (Massimo Girotti and Clara Calamai) portray all the compelling, truthful, and near-operatic emotions, and the key supporting actors are also without their attributes.  It's a brilliant, crushing adaptation, and it points as a striking signpost of what was to come for Visconti in his career. Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative?

Options: - rain forest - tropical areas - pet store - library - story book  Explain why a human would choose \\"story book\\" to answer the question above: The answer to this question is:","output":"\\"Story book\\". This is because a story book is typically where one would find narratives or tales about imaginative or fanciful characters or events, such as talking animals, including monkeys. In fact, conversations or adventures involving animals are common themes in children's literature.  The other options like 'rain forest', 'tropical areas' or 'pet store', are less likely because in real life animals, including monkeys, do not talk like humans do. They communicate in their own ways, but they don't speak or engage in adventurous dialogues as humans might describe in words. Such talking creatures can be found in the realm of fiction, which is why a story book is most likely the place for a child to learn about adventures of a talking monkey.  Lastly, a library could theoretically be an answer as well, since libraries house story books. However, libraries also contain many different types of materials - historical, scientific, and more - which do not pertain to stories about talking animals. Therefore, \\"story book\\" is the most straightforward and specific answer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Generate a detailed description of this data","output":"The data provided pertains to a specific model of automobile, the Abarth 1000 GT Coupé. This vehicle model comes from Abarth, a renowned Italian racing car and road car maker established in 1949. Abarth specializes in the production of high-performance vehicles with a sporty character, and the 1000 GT Coupé embodies these qualities. In the following paragraphs, we will discuss the key characteristics of this vehicle, including its wheelbase, body style, and engine configuration. The wheelbase of the Abarth 1000 GT Coupé is stated to be 2160.0 millimeters. The wheelbase is the measurement of the distance between the center of the front wheel and the center of the rear wheel on the same side of the vehicle. It is crucial in determining the vehicle's dimensions, handling, and ride comfort. In general, a longer wheelbase contributes to better ride comfort and stability, while a shorter wheelbase may provide quicker handling and maneuverability. The 2160.0-millimeter wheelbase of the Abarth 1000 GT Coupé suggests it is designed for agility and sporty handling in line with the brand's identity. As for the body style, the Abarth 1000 GT Coupé is classified as a \\"Two door coupé.\\" This designates a particular form of the car body that features a sleek, sporty appearance with two doors and a sloping rear roofline. This roofline typically merges seamlessly into the rear deck, thus giving the car a smooth and aerodynamic silhouette. The two-door coupé body style has been popular among sports cars in particular, as it exemplifies their performance-oriented character and dynamic driving experience. Under the hood, the Abarth 1000 GT Coupé is powered by a Straight-four engine, which is an internal combustion engine with four cylinders aligned in a single row. This engine arrangement is also commonly referred to as an inline-four engine or an I4 engine. Straight-four engines are known for their compact design, simplicity, and reliability. Moreover, they tend to provide a good balance between performance and fuel efficiency. In the context of the Abarth 1000 GT Coupé, this engine type further emphasizes the vehicle's focus on agility and sporty handling, as it allows for a lighter overall weight and more streamlined shape. To summarize, the data provided highlights three key features of the Abarth 1000 GT Coupé: its 2160.0-millimeter wheelbase, \\"Two door coupé\\" body style, and Straight-four engine configuration. These characteristics combine to offer a vehicle with a sporty, agile, and aerodynamic design that aligns with Abarth's legacy of crafting high-performance cars.

What is the best way to: How to tell if your pan is hot enough.","output":"The best way to tell if your pan is hot enough depends on what you're cooking and the type of pan you're using. However, there are a couple of methods that can help you check the readiness of your pan. Here's the step-by-step process: Step 1: Heat the pan Place the pan on the stovetop and turn the heat to the appropriate level for your recipe. For example, if you're searing meat, you'll want the heat to be medium-high. Step 2: Wait for a couple of minutes Allow the pan to heat up for 2-4 minutes, depending on the size and material of the pan (cast iron pans may take longer to heat up, while a thin non-stick pan might heat up more quickly). Step 3: Use one of the following tests to check the pan's heat - Water droplet test: Flick a few droplets of water onto the surface of the pan. If the water immediately sizzles and evaporates, your pan is hot enough. If the water droplets skitter around the pan before evaporating, the pan is very hot and may be too hot for some delicate ingredients. - Leidenfrost effect test: Wet your fingers, and then quickly flick some water onto the pan. If the water forms droplets that dance around the surface before evaporating, the pan is hot enough for high-heat cooking, like searing or stir-frying. - Butter or oil test: Add a small amount of butter or oil to the pan. If the butter melts quickly but doesn't burn, or the oil becomes thin and shimmery but isn't smoking, the pan is hot enough. Step 4: Adjust the heat as necessary Depending on the results of your test, you may need to further heat the pan or reduce the heat to achieve the desired temperature. Make any adjustments needed and wait for the pan to reach the correct temperature before adding your ingredients. Remember that the best method to use depends on the pan's material and what you're cooking. By following these steps, you can efficiently determine if your pan is hot enough."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
