Question: What does Luke replace? Title: Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back Movie plot: Three years after the destruction of the Death Star, the Rebel Alliance has been driven from their former base on Yavin IV by the Galactic Empire. The Rebels, led by Princess Leia, set up their new base on the ice planet Hoth. The Imperial fleet, led by Darth Vader, continues to hunt for the Rebelsâ new base by dispatching probe droids across the galaxy. While investigating a potential meteor strike, Luke Skywalker is captured by a wampa. He manages to escape from its cave with his lightsaber, but soon succumbs to the brutally cold temperatures. The ghost of his late mentor, Obi-Wan Kenobi, instructs him to go to the Dagobah system to train under Jedi Master Yoda. He is found by Han Solo, who uses the warmth of his dead tauntaun to keep Luke warm while he sets up a shelter. Han and Luke make it through the night and are rescued by Zev Senesca. On patrol, Han and Chewbacca discover the meteor Luke had planned to investigate is actually a probe droid, which alerts the Empire to the Rebelsâ location. The Empire launches a large-scale attack, using AT-AT Walkers to capture the base. Han and Leia escape on the Millennium Falcon with C-3PO and Chewbacca, but their hyperdrive malfunctions. They hide in an asteroid field, where Han and Leia grow closer. Vader summons bounty hunters, including the notorious Boba Fett, to assist in finding the Falcon. Luke, meanwhile, escapes with R2-D2 in his X-wing fighter and crash-lands on the swamp planet Dagobah. He meets a diminutive creature who is revealed to be Yoda; after conferring with Obi-Wan's spirit, Yoda reluctantly accepts Luke as his pupil. After evading the Empire, Han sets a course for Cloud City, a floating colony in the skies of the planet Bespin. Cloud City is run by Han's old friend, Lando Calrissian. Unknowingly, the Millennium Falcon has been tracked by Boba Fett; shortly after they arrive, Lando leads the group into a trap and they are handed over to Darth Vader. Vader plans to use the group as bait to lure out Luke, intending to capture him alive and...

After becoming disabled in a machete attack on a visit to his native Haiti, Jean-Claude Joseph needed help persuading his landlord to move him from a fifth-floor apartment to one on the ground floor. Isaac Benjamin became ensnared in a bureaucratic snafu that took away his Social Security disability payments for more than two years. The story of Martha, a woman from Sierra Leone, was more compelling. Beaten, raped and tortured in her politically repressive homeland, she knowingly used someone else's passport to escape to America, but was caught by immigration authorities upon her arrival. She desperately sought political asylum. Not the kind of cases that lead to ground-breaking upheavals in the law, but the kind of cases that are handled day in and day out by lawyers for the legally disenfranchised who have no where else to turn. The work of attorneys from Legal Services of New Jersey will be highlighted in a onehour documentary, \\"Quest for Justice,\\" to be aired 9 p.m. today on New Jersey Network. Produced by NYD2, a communications firm based in Somerset, the documentary features case histories of clients whose needs ranged from housing to fighting off deportation. Joseph, a 54-year-old naturalized citizen, turned to Legal Services when the landlord of his federally subsidized apartment complex in Elizabeth turned a deaf ear to his request for a ground-floor apartment. Having lost the use of his left arm in warding off the machete attack during a robbery attempt, Joseph said he found it increasingly difficult to negotiate the five flights of stairs lugging groceries or laundry on the frequent occasions when the building's elevator was out of order. \\"With this, it became impossible for me to stay upstairs,\\" he said, pointing to the scars on his forearm. \\"If I cannot carry my groceries or my laundry, how can I live?\\" \\"It was a compelling case,\\" said Legal Services attorney Stephen St. Hilaire. \\"The key for us -- and we have to make tough decisions all the time on whether to take a case -- was visualizing what he had to do to get to the fifth floor, struggling with a bag of groceries,\\" he said. Benjamin, 53, of Jersey City had been collecting Social Security disability after undergoing double bypass surgery when the checks stopped coming. He said the agency claimed he had failed to return a form updating the condition of his health. \\"But what got me was they didn't let me know they didn't get it, they just cut me off,\\" he said, adding he found it impossible to negotiate the Social Security bureaucracy himself.

Please answer the following question: Who did Fluffy protect?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The story opens with Lazlo missing, and Clam and Raj relating the tale up to this point. The first segment reveals how Raj and Clam meet. They meet a common enemy, Edward, who is the camp bully. Most of the other campers follow Edward's lead and after a scuffle, Lazlo makes his appearance. What follows builds Edward's growing resentfulness towards Lazlo, and Lumpus' dissatisfaction with the three new scouts' behavior. After choosing to name their cabin after the jelly bean, Lazlo builds a totem pole to decorate their new cabin, when Lazlo hears an animal in distress. Given Lazlo's nature, he goes to help it, while Clam and Raj choose not to accompany him. Lazlo finds a bear with a pinecone stuck in his nose, and pulls it out, earning the bear's gratefulness. The bear, now named Fluffy, follows Lazlo home and he hides it in his cabin. When Edward tells Lumpus that Lazlo has left camp, they both attempt to confront Lazlo, but are instead met by Fluffy. Protecting Lazlo, Fluffy attacks Edward and Lumpus. While everyone hides in Lumpus' cabin, Lazlo follows Fluffy out of the camp; when Lazlo's torn Bean Scout cap is later found in a gory, flesh-like mess the next day, the others assume that Lazlo was eaten by the bear.  When Edward can find neither the bear nor Lazlo, he concocts a story about how he scared Fluffy off by his \\"skills\\" after witnessing the bear devour Lazlo, and demands the camp's respect. The next series of scenes deal with both Edward spinning a web of lies, and Lumpus trying to come to grips with Lazlo's disappearance, but only due to his fear of Commander Hoo-Ha, not over any concern for the missing scouts. Answer:","output":"Fluffy, the bear, protected Lazlo in the story. Lazlo had helped Fluffy by removing a pinecone stuck in its nose, which gained the bear's gratefulness. When Edward and Lumpus tried to confront Lazlo, Fluffy protected him by attacking them, showcasing the bear's loyalty to Lazlo due to his kind act."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Tokugawa Takes All: When Hideyoshi died in 1598, he hoped to have his five-year-old son continue his \\"dynasty,\\" initially under the tutelage of five regents. But one of the regents was Ieyasu Tokugawa, who had been biding his time at Edo for 12 years, nurturing dynastic ambitions of his own. Of the cunning, ruthless triumvirate that came out on top at the end of the country's century of civil war, Tokugawa was without doubt the most patient, the most prudent — and most treacherous. He moved quickly to eliminate his strongest rivals, crushing them in 1600 at the great Battle of Sekigahara (near modern Nagoya). During its subsequent two and a half centuries of rule from the new capital established at Edo, the Tokugawa organized a tightly controlled coalition of some 260 daimyo in strategic strongholds throughout the country. The allegiance of this highly privileged and prestigious group was ensured by cementing their ethical principles in the code of bushido, \\"The way of the warrior\\": loyalty to one's master, defense of one's status and honor, and fulfillment of all obligations. Loyalty was further enforced by holding the vassals' wives and children hostage in Edo. All roads into Edo, the most famous being the Tokaido Highway, had checkpoints for guns coming in and for wives going out. One of the most effective ways of keeping a tight rein on the country was to cut it off from the outside world, to keep Japan Japanese. At first, Ieyasu Tokugawa was eager to promote foreign trade. He wanted silk and encouraged the Dutch and British as good, nonproselytizing Protestants just interested in trade. But he didn't like the Portuguese and Spanish Catholic missionaries, who he felt were undermining traditional Japanese values. He banned their activities in 1612 and two years later ordered the expulsion of all missionaries and unrepentant Japanese converts. Executions and torture followed. Converts were forced to renounce their faith by trampling crucifixes and effigies of Jesus and Mary. The Catholic Church has counted 3,125 martyrs in Japan from 1597 (beginning under Hideyoshi) to 1660. In 1635 the Japanese were forbidden, on pain of death, to attempt to travel abroad, and Japanese citizens already overseas were prevented from returning, in case they brought back subversive Christian doctrines. Western books were banned, as were Chinese books that mentioned Christianity.

Short movie review: take any 12-year-old boy to see this picture , and he 'll be your slave for a year  Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"The critic seems to be thinking positively about the movie. By stating \\"take any 12-year-old boy to see this picture, and he'll be your slave for a year,\\" the critic implies the movie holds a strong appeal for a specific demographic, in this case, 12-year-old boys. Although the review is brief, it conveys the impression that the film might be highly entertaining or engaging for the young audience, so much so that the experience might lead the boy to be immensely grateful or appreciative - metaphorically, 'a slave for a year'. This phrase doesn't mean that the critic necessarily thinks the movie has artistic merit or that it would be enjoyable for diverse audiences; it could be that it's seen as a film that primarily appeals to younger tastes due to its content, themes, and execution. However, within this context, the critic seems to endorse the film positively. They could be suggesting that the movie captures the youthful imagination, sense of adventure, or passion for a specific genre (like science fiction, fantasy, or action) that is often strong in boys of this age. However, it's important to delve deeper for a full appreciation. In the absence of specific details about the film's plot, style, performances, or other aspects, we can't be sure about the critic's view of the movie in a broader sense. For instance, does the movie have qualities that adults can appreciate? Is it well-made and original, or is it derivative but still exciting for younger viewers? What makes it so appealing to a younger demographic - Is it the action sequences, humor, or the spirit of adventure? These unknowns prevent us from forming a blanket judgement about the critic's overall view. In a comprehensive evaluation, therefore, while the original statement suggests a positive reception for a particular audience (12-year-old boys), it doesn't provide a complete picture of the critic's thoughts on the film's wider appeal, artistic value, or overall quality."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It's quite common to retain original names in the target language.     2. Translate the time and date: \\"arrived on Monday (August 16th)\\" translates to \\"Pazartesi günü (16 Ağustos'ta) geldi\\".

Despite lying fifth in the Spanish Primera Liga table, Sevilla were knocked out of the lucrative European Champions League by Russian side CSKA Moscow last week. Jimenez had also secured a Copa del Rey final against Atletico Madrid but it wasn't enough to save the 46-year-old's job. The club's sporting director Ramon Rodriguez admitted the decision had been difficult but said he had \\"done what I had to.\\" He told the club's official Web site: \\"It was an unavoidable situation and we had to find a solution, and the pain that it brings. \\"Tuesday was the end of the story but the decision comes from the image and dynamics of the team.

After about 30 minutes he had completed this and then offered as a free service to inspect the electrical parts of the house. He went out back to the fuse box to look and then after inspection offered to show me what he had found. It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that’s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas. He went over ever single fuse and wire that we had and explained about the piping and all the other things that go with it and that what we have isn’t what is recommended anymore. Our house was about 9 years old at the time. We were back there for more than 90 minutes. I started getting very restless because I wanted to work on dinner, the sun was blazing hot and I needed to do many other things. It was coming up on 5 o’clock. He then went to his truck to write up an estimate. After 20 minutes or so he comes back and tells me it will be about 10,000 to fix our fuse box system.

The old man behind the counter reached for Greg's dollar with a noticeably shaky hand that looked as though it had held more cigarettes and booze than money in its lifetime. He took his coffee and walked up the stairs to the second floor. There were about fifty people standing in the hallway outside the courtroom making small talk. He recognized a few of them, but was in no mood to start a conversation. Only four more jurors and two alternates were needed. With a little luck, he would soon be sent on his way. The coffee tasted bitter, but he continued to sip on it anyway, just to occupy himself.

Background: Odissi (Odia: odd'ishii Odisi), also referred to as Orissi in older literature, is a major ancient Indian classical dance that originated in the Hindu temples of Odisha - an eastern coastal state of India. Odissi, in its history, was performed predominantly by women, and expressed religious stories and spiritual ideas, particularly of Vaishnavism (Vishnu as Jagannath). Odissi performances have also expressed ideas of other traditions such as those related to Hindu gods Shiva and Surya, as well as Hindu goddesses (Shaktism). The theoretical foundations of Odissi trace to the ancient Sanskrit text Natya Shastra, its existence in antiquity evidenced by the dance poses in the sculptures of Odissi Hindu temples, and archeological sites related to Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. Context: The Buddhist, Jain and Hindu archaeological sites in Odisha state, particularly the Assia range of hills show inscriptions and carvings of dances that are dated to the 6th to 9th century CE. Important sites include the Ranigumpha in Udaygiri, and various caves and temples at Lalitgiri, Ratnagiri and Alatgiri sites. The Buddhist icons, for example, are depicted as dancing gods and goddesses, with Haruka, Vajravarahi, and Marichi in Odissi-like postures. Historical evidence, states Alexandra Carter, shows that Odissi Maharis (Hindu temple dancers) and dance halls architecture (nata-mandap) were in vogue at least by the 9th century CE.  According to Kapila Vatsyayan, the Kalpasutra of Jainism, in its manuscripts discovered in Gujarat, includes classical Indian dance poses - such as the Samapada, the Tribhangi and the Chuaka of Odissi. This, states Vatsyayan, suggests that Odissi was admired or at least well known in distant parts of India, far from Odisha in the medieval era, to be included in the margins of an important Jain text. However, the Jain manuscripts use the dance poses as decorative art in the margins and cover, but do not describe or discuss the dance. Hindu dance texts such as the Abhinaya Chandrika and Abhinaya Darpana provide a detailed description of the movements of the feet, hands, the standing postures, the movement and the dance repertoire. It includes illustrations of the Karanas mentioned in NatyaShastra. Similarly, the illustrated Hindu text on temple architecture from Odisha, the Shilpaprakasha, deals with Odia architecture and sculpture, and includes Odissi postures.  Actual sculptures that have survived into the modern era and panel reliefs in Odia temples, dated to be from the 10th to 14th century, show Odissi dance. This is evidenced in Jagannath temple in Puri, as well as other temples of Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism and Vedic deities such as Surya (Sun) in Odisha. There are several sculptures of dancers and musicians in Konark Sun Temple and Brahmeswara Temple in Bhubaneswar.  The composition of the poetic texts by 8th century Shankaracharya and particularly of divine love inspired Gitagovinda by 12th century Jayadeva influenced the focus and growth of modern Odissi. Odissi was performed in the temples by the dancers called Maharis, who played out these spiritual poems and underlying religious plays, after training and perfecting their art of dance starting from an early age, and who were revered as auspicious to religious services. Question: Were there anyone in the Medieval who did not like this form of dancing?. Whats the answer?","output":"The available historical and textual evidence suggests that Odissi dance was admired and appreciated in the medieval era, especially considering its prevalence in temple sculptures and its influence on Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain cultural expressions. However, it is possible that there might have been some individuals in the medieval period who did not like this form of dancing. As with any art form, personal preferences and tastes vary, and it is generally impossible to account for the opinions of every individual during a specific historical period. Additionally, religious or cultural differences might have led some individuals to disapprove of or not appreciate the form. Nevertheless, the prevailing evidence points to the widespread appreciation and admiration for Odissi dance during the medieval era. Its connections to religious expression, temple architecture, and spiritual poetry contributed to its prominence and influence in ancient India."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Available options: 1). to carry nutrients. 2). to carry information. 3). to prevent disease. 4). to prevent dehydration. Answer the following question given this paragraph:   There are many choices you can make to keep your nervous system healthy. One obvious choice is to avoid using alcohol or other drugs. Not only will you avoid the injury that drugs themselves can cause, but you will also be less likely to get involved in other risky behaviors that could harm your nervous system. Another way to keep the nervous system healthy is to eat a variety of healthy foods. The minerals sodium, calcium, and potassium, and vitamins B 1 and B 12 are important for a healthy nervous system. Some foods that are good sources for these minerals and vitamins include milk, whole grains, beef steak, and kidney beans (shown in Figure below ). Your brain also needs healthy fats like those in nuts and fish. Recall that fats insulate the axons of neurons. These fats help build new connections between nerves and brain cells. These fats may improve memory and increase learning and intelligence. Water is also important for the nervous system, so drink plenty of water and other fluids. This helps prevent dehydration, which can cause confusion and memory problems. And get plenty of rest. Your brain requires plenty of rest so it can strengthen circuits that help with memory. A good night’s sleep will help keep your brain functioning at its best.   Q: Why is water important for the nervous system?

He realizes that the best way to learn physics is to solve problems. To that end, he needs to to convert pressure of objects from one unit to another. In one problem, four scenarios are given for the same object, scenario A, scenario B, scenario C, and scenario D. In scenario A the pressure is given in Pascals. In scenario B the pressure is given in the atm. In scenario C the pressure is given in torr. Lastly, in scenario D the pressure is given in psi.  and a hint : Pressures are given in a multitude of units. We've already discussed Pascals, and we know that another unit for pressure is the atmosphere (1 atm = 101.3 x 10 5 Pa). The third commonly used pressure unit is the torr (symbol Torr). 760 torr is 1 atm, but 1 torr is also the increase in pressure necessary to cause liquid mercury to rise by 1 mm. For that reason, torr is also commonly referred to as \\"millimeters mercury.\\" Another pressure unit commonly used in our everyday world is psi, or pounds per square inch, though neither psi nor torr are SI units.  Please answer this question : Which scenario's unit would most likely be used in everyday world, scenario A or scenario D? The answer is:","output":"Scenario D would most likely be used in everyday world. The reason for this is because scenario D's pressure is given in psi, which stands for pounds per square inch. Psi is a unit of pressure that is commonly used in many everyday situations, especially when dealing with tire pressure, hydraulic systems, and air pressure systems. Scenario A uses Pascals as its unit of pressure, which is the standard unit in the International System of Units (SI). While Pascals are widely used in scientific and engineering settings, they are less commonly encountered in everyday life when compared to psi. In summary, although Pascals (scenario A) are more commonly used in scientific and engineering contexts, pounds per square inch (scenario D) are more likely to be encountered in everyday situations, making scenario D the most likely unit to be used in the everyday world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: En Vogue is an American R&B/Pop vocal group whose original lineup consisted of singers Terry Ellis, Dawn Robinson, Cindy Herron, and Maxine Jones. Formed in Oakland, California in 1988, En Vogue reached number two on the US Hot 100 with the single \\"Hold On\\", which was taken from their 1990 debut album Born To Sing. The group's 1992 follow-up album Funky Divas reached the top 10 in both the US and UK, and included their second US number two hit \\"My Lovin' (You're Never Gonna Get It)\\", plus the US top 10 hits \\" Context: In 1995, En Vogue was amongst numerous African-American female vocalists featured on the song \\"Freedom\\" for the soundtrack to Mario Van Peebles' drama film Panther (1995). Also in 1995, while band members Cindy Herron and Maxine Jones went on maternity leave, Ellis recorded and released a solo album entitled Southern Gal, which spun off the top ten R&B single \\"Where Ever You Are.\\" The same year, the band also made a cameo appearance in Joel Schumachers superhero film Batman Forever. In 1996, En Vogue recorded \\"Don't Let Go (Love)\\" for the soundtrack to the motion picture Set It Off, directed by F. Gary Gray. Released as the soundtrack's lead single in the fall 1996, it became the group's biggest hit yet, selling over 1.8 million copies worldwide and becoming certified platinum by the RIAA. In response to the large commercial success of \\"Don't Let Go (Love),\\" the group steadfastly went to work on their third studio album. As the album was nearing completion, Robinson chose to leave the group in April 1997 after difficult contractual negotiations reached a stalemate. Despite Robinson's abrupt departure, Ellis, Herron, and Jones resolved to continue on as a trio.  Robinson's abrupt departure from En Vogue forced the remaining trio to re-record several of her original lead vocals on their forthcoming album EV3, which was released in June 1997. A breakaway from previous projects, it marked En Vogue's first project to include a diverse roster of collaborators including credits from Babyface, David Foster, Diane Warren, Andrea Martin, and Ivan Matias along with regular contributors Foster & McElroy. Upon its release, EV3 received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom praised the band's vocal performances but were critical with overall production of the album. In the US, it reached the top ten in Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom and debuted at number eight on both Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and the Billboard 200 with sales of 76,500 units, the band's highest first-week numbers. Two further singles released from the album, \\"Whatever\\" and \\"Too Gone, Too Long\\", entered the top twenty and top forty the Billboard Hot 100, respectively.

After the breakup of his gothic rock band the Marked, singer and guitarist Billy Corgan left St. Petersburg, Florida, to return to his native city of Chicago, where he took a job in a record store and formed the idea of a new band to be called the Smashing Pumpkins. While working there, he met guitarist James Iha. Adorning themselves with paisley and other psychedelic trappings, the two began writing songs together (with the aid of a drum machine) that were heavily influenced by The Cure and New Order. The duo performed live for the first time on July 9, 1988 at the Polish bar Chicago 21. This performance included only Corgan on bass and Iha on guitar with a drum machine. Shortly thereafter, Corgan met D'arcy Wretzky after a show by the Dan Reed Network where they argued the merits of the band. After finding out Wretzky played bass guitar, Corgan recruited her into the lineup and the now-trio played a show at the Avalon Nightclub. After this show, Cabaret Metro owner Joe Shanahan agreed to book the band on the condition that they replace the drum machine with a live drummer.  Jazz drummer Jimmy Chamberlin was recommended by a friend of Corgan's. Chamberlin knew little of alternative music and immediately changed the sound of the nascent band. As Corgan recalled of the period, \\"We were completely into the sad-rock, Cure kind of thing. It took about two or three practices before I realized that the power in his playing was something that enabled us to rock harder than we could ever have imagined.\\" On October 5, 1988, the complete band took the stage for the first time at the Cabaret Metro.  In 1989 the Smashing Pumpkins made their first appearance on record with the compilation album Light Into Dark, which featured several Chicago alternative bands. The group released its first single, \\"I Am One\\", in 1990 on local Chicago label Limited Potential. The single sold out and they released a follow-up, \\"Tristessa\\", on Sub Pop, after which they signed to Caroline Records. The band recorded their 1991 debut studio album Gish with producer Butch Vig at his Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin for 20,000. In order to gain the consistency he desired, Corgan often played all instruments excluding drums, which created tension in the band. The music fused heavy metal guitars, psychedelia, and dream pop, garnering them comparisons to Jane's Addiction. Gish became a minor success, with the single \\"Rhinoceros\\" receiving some airplay on modern rock radio. After releasing the Lull EP in October 1991 on Caroline Records, the band formally signed with Virgin Records, which was affiliated with Caroline. The band supported the album with a tour that included opening for bands such as the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Jane's Addiction, and Guns N' Roses. During the tour, Iha and Wretzky went through a messy breakup, Chamberlin became addicted to narcotics and alcohol, and Corgan entered a deep depression, writing some songs for the upcoming album in the parking garage where he lived at the time.

Review: Fashionably fragmented, yet infuriatingly half-realized character-study, an examination of the different personalities of two college roommates: a talented but undisciplined star basketball player, and a pot-smoking, womanizing rabble-rouser. We never learn why these young men are friends. They may share confusions about the world and their places in it, but they don't seem to have anything else in common. Making his directorial debut, Jack Nicholson--who also co-wrote the screenplay with Jeremy Larner, based upon Larner's book--doesn't introduce us to the characters with any clarity, nor he does shape the scenes to help us identify with anyone on the screen. There are some very decent performances here (particularly from newcomer William Tepper in the central role), but most of the picture is unformed (perhaps intentionally), sketchy or unsure. Bruce Dern plays the hard-driving basketball coach, Karen Black is the older, married lady Tepper is having an affair with, and Michael Margotta is Tepper's wayward friend (in an off-putting, over-the-top performance). Nicholson fails to set up the sequences with any particular flavor, preferring (I assume) to let the character interaction dominate the film's tone; his script is no help either, and as a result it is unclear whom we're supposed to sympathize with. Small, random moments do work (a supermarket fight between Tepper and Black, Dern visiting Tepper in his dorm-room, all of the scenes set on the court), however the entire third act of the picture is an excruciating mess. Hoping to juxtapose an all-important b-ball game with a sexual assault, Nicholson shows no style at his craft (nor does he earn points for chutzpah, as his staging of these events is squashy and ugly). When a director goes out of his way to humiliate his actors, one has to question his motives in doing so. Perhaps if \\"Drive, He Said\\" ultimately made some sort of powerful statement in the bargain, audiences could forgive the filmmaker for his lapses in judgment and taste. Unfortunately, the perplexing closer is as dumbfounding as much of the rest of the movie. *1/2 from **** Now, what is this review like? Select from: [I] negative; [II] positive;","output":"This review is predominantly negative. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with various aspects of the movie, such as the unclear character introduction, the director's preference for character interaction over scene setting, and an underdeveloped script that fails to elicit sympathy for any character.

The answer to the question: What part of the eye is enlarged in the animal that are not thought to have a good sense of taste? is inside the article: The whale ear has specific adaptations to the marine environment. In humans, the middle ear works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In whales, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, whales receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The whale ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater. Odontocetes send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. The melon size varies between species, the bigger the more dependent they are of it. A beaked whale for example has a small bulge sitting on top of its skull, whereas a sperm whale's head is filled up mainly with the melon.The whale eye is relatively small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, the eyes of a whale are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When belugas surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; they contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light, but they have far more rod cells than they do cone cells. Whales do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for colour vision than most mammals. Most whales have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a  tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, a very clear image of the surrounding area.

Historically steeped and culturally vibrant, Dublin is not just a city but an emblem of Ireland's rich and tumultuous history that dates back to the Viking era. With a population of over one million people, Dublin is the largest city in Ireland, accounting for about a quarter of the total population of the Republic. The Republic of Ireland's relationship with its capital, Dublin, is a special one. Dublin houses the nation's major political, educational, cultural, and financial institutions, including the parliament of Ireland (Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann), the major universities (Trinity College and University College Dublin), the National Museum, and the central banks. This city has been the nation's hub of commerce and administration since medieval times, enhancing the ties that bind the city to the Republic. Famous for its Georgian architecture, vibrant arts scene, and rich literary tradition, Dublin offers a unique charm to both its inhabitants and visitors from around the globe. The city's deep-rooted literary culture, which birthed renowned writers such as Oscar Wilde, Samuel Beckett, and James Joyce, is a testament to the city's place in the Republic's cultural heritage. Dublin's contributions to literature and arts make it not just a capital city, but the heart of the Republic of Ireland's cultural identity. Furthermore, Dublin's location on the eastern coast also shapes its economic role within the Republic of Ireland. The city is home to the Republic's busiest port, Dublin Port, and the main international gateway, Dublin Airport. These crucial transport hubs reinforce Dublin's status as the country's epicentre of trade and international connections. In conclusion, Dublin is a significant constituent of the Republic of Ireland. The rich history, thriving culture, central political role, economic importance, and vibrant social fabric weave Dublin into the very fabric of the Republic.

Write a summary based on this article: WASHINGTON -- The United States tortured al Qaeda detainees captured after the Sept. 11,2001 attacks, President Obama acknowledged Friday, in some of his most expansive comments to date about a controversial set of CIA practices that he banned after taking office.      \\"We tortured some folks,\\" Obama said at a televised news conference at the White House. \\"We did some things that were contrary to our values.\\"      Addressing the impending release of a Senate report that criticizes CIA treatment of detainees, Obama said he believed the mistreatment happened because of the pressure national security officials felt to forestall another attack. He said Americans should not be too \\"sanctimonious\\" about passing judgment through the lens of a seemingly safer present day.      That posture, which he expressed as a candidate for national office in 2008 and early in his presidency, explains why Obama did not push to pursue criminal charges against the Bush era officials who carried out the CIA program. To this day, many of those officials insist that what they did was not torture, which is a felony under U.S. law.      Still, Obama's remarks on Friday were more emphatic than his previous comments on the subject, including a 2009 speech in which he trumpeted his ban of \\"so-called enhanced interrogation techniques,\\" and \\"brutal methods,\\" but did not flatly say the U.S. has engaged in torture.      \\"I believe that waterboarding was torture and, whatever legal rationales were used, it was a mistake,\\" he said in April 2009.      Obama on Friday did not address two other central arguments of the soon-to-be-released Senate report - that the brutal interrogations didn't produce life-saving intelligence, and that the CIA lied to other elements of the U.S. government about exactly what it was doing.      \\"This is a question about the credibility of the CIA and what they said about the effectiveness of this program,\\" said CBS News National Security Analyst Juan Zarate. \\"What we're going to see is, out in the open, further debate about the enhanced interrogation techniques that were applied by the CIA in the first and early parts of the Bush administration.\\"      The president also expressed confidence in his CIA director, John Brennan, in the wake of an internal CIA report documenting that the spy agency improperly accessed Senate computers. There have been calls for his resignation by congressional lawmakers. ||||| A Senate official, who asked not to be named before the release of the report, said Sunday that its authors were saving their response to General Hayden, Mr. Rodriguez and others until the report was public so that they could review the facts they gathered and let Americans make up their own minds.      Image Former President George W. Bush in August. Credit Brendan Smialowski/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images      According to those familiar with it, the 6,000-page report by the Senate Intelligence Committee takes a sharply critical view of the C.I.A.’s interrogation of terrorism suspects in the first years after the Sept. 11 attacks, questioning the efficacy of torture and revealing more details about the program. It also suggests C.I.A. officers in the field may have misled officials at headquarters.      Mr. Bush and his advisers have been largely quiet about the Senate report until now, and former intelligence officials worried whether the Bush team would defend them. Some former administration officials privately encouraged the president and his top advisers to use the report to disclaim responsibility for the interrogation program on the grounds that they were not kept fully informed.      But Mr. Bush and his inner circle rejected that suggestion. “Even if some officials privately believe they were not given all the facts, they feel it would be immoral and disloyal to throw the C.I.A. to the wolves at this point,” said one former official, who like others did not want to be identified speaking about the report before its release.      Another former official, who remains close to Mr. Bush, said the former president did not believe that the C.I.A. had misinformed him.      “The idea that George Tenet, John McLaughlin, Mike Hayden and Steve Kappes would knowingly mislead the president and the country is absurd,” the former official said. Mr. Kappes was another deputy C.I.A. director during the Bush era. “This was not a rogue program. And nobody in our administration is going to throw the C.I.A. over the side on this.”      The former officials said that neither Mr. Bush nor his advisers had been interviewed by the committee. William Burck, a former deputy White House counsel serving as a lawyer for Mr. Bush, was offered the opportunity to review the report on his behalf but only after it was written, at which point it was too late to offer meaningful input, former officials said. The offer at that point, they said, was declined. ||||| WASHINGTON -- Foreign governments and U.S. intelligence agencies are predicting that the release of a Senate report examining the use of torture by the CIA will cause \\"violence and deaths\\" abroad, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee said Sunday.      Rep. Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican, is regularly briefed on intelligence assessments. He told CNN's \\"State of the Union\\" that U.S. intelligence agencies and foreign governments have said privately that the release of the report on CIA interrogations a decade ago will be used by extremists to incite violence that is likely to cost lives. The 480-page report, a summary of a still-classified 6,000 page study, is expected to be made public next week.      \\"I think this is a terrible idea,\\" Rogers said of the expected release. \\"Our foreign partners are telling us this will cause violence and deaths...Foreign leaders have approached the government and said, 'You do this, this will cause violence and deaths.' Our own intelligence community has assessed that this will cause violence and deaths.\\"      A U.S. intelligence official, who was not authorized to be quoted discussing classified intelligence assessments, said Congress had been warned \\"of the heightened potential that the release could stimulate a violent response.\\"      That concern was seconded Sunday by former CIA Director Michael Hayden, who told CBS News' \\"Face the Nation\\" that the report could \\"be used by our enemies to motivate people to attack Americans in American facilities overseas.\\"      \\"I am genuinely concerned by that, as was the secretary of state and the director of national intelligence,\\" he said.      He also warned that the report's release could undermine cooperation between the U.S. and other countries on intelligence and counterterrorism. \\"There are countries out there who have cooperated with us in the war on terror at some political risk who were relying on American discretion,\\" he explained. \\"I can't imagine anyone out there going forward in the future who would be willing to do anything with us that even smacks of political danger.\\"      On Friday, Secretary of State John Kerry urged the senator in charge of the report to consider the timing of the release, though Obama administration officials say they still support making it public. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat and chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has not responded to reports of the Kerry call, though she told the Los Angeles Times in a story published Sunday that \\"We have to get this report out.\\"      A congressional aide noted that the White House has led negotiations to declassify the report since April, and that both the president and his director of national intelligence have endorsed its release. The government has taken steps to beef up security at American posts around the world, said the aide, who was not authorized to be quoted by name and spoke on condition of anonymity.      The report amounts to the first public accounting of the CIA's use of torture on al Qaeda detainees held in secret facilities in Europe and Asia in the years after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.      U.S. officials who have read the report say it includes disturbing new details about the CIA's use of such techniques as sleep deprivation, confinement in small spaces, humiliation and the simulated drowning process known as waterboarding. President Barack Obama has acknowledged, \\"We tortured some folks.\\" The report also says the torture failed to produce life-saving intelligence, a conclusion disputed by current and former intelligence officials, including CIA director John Brennan.      Rogers questioned why the report needed to become public, given that the Justice Department investigated and filed no criminal charges.      \\"What good will come of this report?\\" he asked. \\"There's been a Department of Justice investigation. It was stopped under the Bush administration. There has been congressional action to stop this activity. President Obama put an executive order saying he wouldn't continue any of that activity.\\"      Feinstein told the Los Angeles Times that the harsh interrogations undermined \\"societal and constitutional values that we are very proud of. Anybody who reads this is going to never let this happen again.\\" ||||| CBS News has confirmed that the Obama administration is bracing itself for a Tuesday release of the long-awaited CIA torture report, though the timing ultimately remains at the discretion of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Sources familiar with the matter confirm to CBS News State Department Correspondent Margaret Brennan that Secretary of State John Kerry called and requested, but did not pressure, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, the chairwoman of the Intelligence Committee, to hold off on releasing the report. The administration has some concerns about the safety of diplomats abroad. Bloomberg View first reported the conversation between Kerry and Feinstein.      The Intelligence Committee has been negotiating for months with the White House over redactions to the report, after it voted earlier this year to declassify it. The report, which examines the CIA's now-defunct detention and interrogation program, took five years to produce and is about 6,000 pages. Though the committee voted to declassify the entire report, the committee is expected to release next week just an executive report, which is hundreds of pages long instead of thousands.      The report has led to profoundly tense relations between the CIA, and the Senate Intelligence Committee, the congressional body tasked with oversight of the agency. In March, Feinstein went to the Senate floor to charge that the CIA was spying on committee staff members who were working on the report.      Kerry happens to be back in the U.S. this weekend, so he also offered to go to Congress to testify this week on the Authorization for Use of Military Force for the fight against ISIS. ||||| Summary:","output":"A long time ago, after some very bad people attacked buildings in America, the United States government wanted to find out more about these bad people to keep everyone safe.

Please answer the following question: QUEBEC CITY — Emotions were on display when U.S. President Donald Trump met other G-7 leaders at their annual summit in Canada on Friday, but the discussions were civilized and diplomatic, according to sources. Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). She said Canada, however, will not change its mind about the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs which she termed “illegal.” Trump imposed the tariffs on the grounds that weak domestic industries could affect U.S. national security. America’s closest allies, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, are introducing retaliatory tariffs. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

[iv] endocytosis.","output":"Phagocytosis, pinocytosis, and receptor-mediated endocytosis are the three types of [iv] endocytosis.  Endocytosis is a cellular process by which substances are internalized into the cell by being enveloped within the cell membrane. These different types of endocytosis allow cells to ingest and transport various molecules and particles: 1. Phagocytosis: Also known as \\"cell eating,\\" phagocytosis is a process in which the cell engulfs large particles or even whole cells, usually for the purpose of breaking them down and obtaining nutrients or defending against pathogens. Immune cells like macrophages and neutrophils typically engage in this process to eliminate foreign invaders. 2. Pinocytosis: Sometimes referred to as \\"cell drinking,\\" pinocytosis involves the internalization of extracellular fluids, including any dissolved substances, into small vesicles within the cell. This process allows the cell to sample its environment, take in nutrients, and maintain a balance of fluids. 3. Receptor-mediated endocytosis: This is a highly specific and targeted form of endocytosis that depends on the recognition of molecules by specific cell surface receptors. When a particular molecule, such as a hormone or nutrient, binds to its corresponding receptor on the cell surface, the cell membrane forms a vesicle around the complex, allowing the molecule to be transported into the cell. This process is critical for cellular communication and the regulation of cellular processes."},{"instruction":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question.

Question: Which English inventor was responsible for the introduction of the multi-spool spinning frame known as the Spinning Jenny in1764? Answer:","output":"James Hargreaves, an English carpenter and weaver, was responsible for the introduction of the multi-spool spinning frame known as the Spinning Jenny in 1764. James Hargreaves was born in the village of Oswaldtwistle, in Lancashire, England, in 1720. He started his career as a carpenter but later shifted his focus to the textile industry as he was also a weaver. Hargreaves had limited formal education but was a skilled artisan with a keen interest in seeking innovations and improvements in textile machinery. The textile industry during the 18th century was undergoing rapid changes due to the onset of the Industrial Revolution. Prior to Hargreaves' invention, the spinning of cotton yarn was largely done using the traditional spinning wheel, which was a slow and labor-intensive process. One person could only spin one thread at a time, resulting in low production levels and slow progress in the industry. The Spinning Jenny revolutionized the textile industry by significantly increasing the production speed and efficiency of spinning. The Spinning Jenny was essentially a multi-spool spinning frame where several spools were mounted on a wooden frame and spun simultaneously using a single wheel. The original Spinning Jenny could simultaneously spin eight threads. Over time, the design was further refined to accommodate up to 120 spools in the later versions, allowing for a massive increase in productivity. Following the introduction of the Spinning Jenny, textile production greatly increased, making it easier for weavers to obtain yarn in larger quantities and thereby reducing the costs associated with producing textiles. As a result, the price of clothing and other textiles started to decline, making them more accessible to a broader range of people. However, the Spinning Jenny had its share of controversies. The invention garnered resentment from skilled spinners who felt threatened by the potential loss of jobs due to the mechanization of yarn spinning. Consequently, the rapid growth of mechanized textile production played a role in prompting the Luddite movement in the early 19th century. Despite the controversies surrounding James Hargreaves' invention, there is no doubt that the Spinning Jenny marked a significant milestone in the development of modern textile machinery and played a pivotal role in shaping the dynamics of the industry during the Industrial Revolution. James Hargreaves' contributions to the textile industry significantly impacted the socio-economic growth in the centuries that followed, transforming the way people lived, worked, and consumed goods."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Theodore Roosevelt Jr. ( ROH-z@-velt; October 27, 1858 - January 6, 1919) was an American statesman and writer who served as the 26th President of the United States from 1901 to 1909. He also served as the 25th Vice President of the United States from March to September 1901 and as the 33rd Governor of New York from 1899 to 1900. As a leader of the Republican Party during this time, he became a driving force for the Progressive Era in the United States in the early 20th century. His face is depicted on Mount Rushmore, alongside those of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln. In the 1896 presidential election, Roosevelt backed Speaker of the House Thomas Brackett Reed for the Republican nomination, but William McKinley won the nomination and defeated William Jennings Bryan in the general election. Roosevelt opposed Bryan's free silver platform, viewing many of Bryan's followers as dangerous fanatics, and Roosevelt gave campaign speeches for McKinley. Urged by Congressman Henry Cabot Lodge, President McKinley appointed Roosevelt as the Assistant Secretary of the Navy in 1897. Secretary of the Navy John D. Long was more concerned about formalities than functions, was in poor health, and left many major decisions to Roosevelt. Influenced by Alfred Thayer Mahan, Roosevelt called for a build-up in the country's naval strength, particularly the construction of battleships. Roosevelt also began pressing his national security views regarding the Pacific and the Caribbean on McKinley, and was particularly adamant that Spain be ejected from Cuba. He explained his priorities to one of the Navy's planners in late 1897:  I would regard war with Spain from two viewpoints: first, the advisability on the grounds both of humanity and self-interest of interfering on behalf of the Cubans, and of taking one more step toward the complete freeing of America from European dominion; second, the benefit done our people by giving them something to think of which is not material gain, and especially the benefit done our military forces by trying both the Navy and Army in actual practice.  On February 15, 1898, the Maine exploded in the harbor of Havana, Cuba, killing hundreds of crew members. While Roosevelt and many other Americans blamed Spain for the explosion, McKinley sought a diplomatic solution. Without approval from Long or McKinley, Roosevelt sent out orders to several naval vessels, directing them to prepare for war. George Dewey, who had received an appointment to lead the Asiatic Squadron with the backing of Roosevelt, later credited his victory at the Battle of Manila Bay to Roosevelt's orders. After finally giving up hope of a peaceful solution, McKinley asked Congress to declare war upon Spain, beginning the Spanish-American War.","output":"This text is about Theodore Roosevelt Jr. He was the 26th President of the United States from 1901 to 1909, the 25th Vice President, and the 33rd Governor of New York.

Article: If the burn has damaged vital organs, caused major blood loss, or led to shock, your life could be at risk. While addressing the actual burn injury as soon as possible greatly improves the recovery outlook, the medical team may need to stabilize your vital signs first. Let the emergency room and critical care team to their job. Once they’ve stabilized you, they’ll attend to the burn wounds. Stabilizing a victim of third degree burns might include using IV’s, providing oxygen, intubating or ventilating an unconscious victim, performing CPR or using and AED defibrillator.. Debris like scorched clothing, along with dead tissue, must be removed from the wound as soon as possible in order to reduce the risk of serious infections or other complications. Based on the nature of your burn, you might be placed in a special tub for cleaning and debriding, or surgical procedures may be required. In ECMO, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, doctors will draw your blood in a plastic tube. Carbon dioxide is removed from the blood, oxygen is added, and the blood is returned to the body. This treatment, along with a low-level ventilator to keep your lungs moving, will ease the workload on your lungs as they heal. Keeping the burn area warm and moist can aid in the healing process. This might be provided through specially equipped room heaters and humidifiers, fluidized mattresses, and other equipment utilized in the hospital’s intensive care unit (ICU). Talk to your doctor about any environmental adjustments -- such as turning up the thermostat or adding a humidifier -- you should make at home once you are discharged. While third degree burns are sometimes painless at first due to nerve damage, you will likely experience significant pain eventually. The medical team will develop a pain management regimen suited to the specifics of your condition. You may need to be on pain medications long-term.

He was 57 when she interviewed for the position of Assistant District Attorney. At the time, she thought he was 70. Two months ago, she had become the District Attorney. She loved seeing her name on the door. And she felt a rush of adrenaline every time a judge referred to her as 'The District Attorney' in open court. The D.A.'s office would be better than ever--now that she was running the show.

During the siege of Jerusalem by the First Crusade in 1099, the Jewish inhabitants of the city fought side by side with the Fatimid garrison and the Muslim population who tried in vain to defend the city against the Crusaders. When the city fell, about 60,000 people were massacred, including 6,000 Jews seeking refuge in a synagogue. At this time, a full thousand years after the fall of the Jewish state, there were Jewish communities all over the country.

First, we notice that both terms of the equation contain the variable q. When similar terms are added or subtracted, we group them together. We can simplify this equation by combining the q terms. The equation thus becomes: 3 = q (-107+108). Solving the equation inside the parentheses: -107+108 = 1, So, the equation can now be simplified to: 3 = q * 1, Multiplication by 1 leaves any number unchanged. Therefore, q * 1 becomes just q.

Both Nicaragua and Costa Rica had large tract of pristine forests. They had one of the largest concentration of tropical species. In the 1980s Nicaragua started clearing up some of these forests. Instead, they have now vast tract of sugarcane production in that land. One can still visit Costa Rica where they kept those pristine forests intact.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which country's indigenours animals would most likely survive and stay put?  Hint: Besides anthropogenic productivity of the land, the biodiversity of degraded land also declines, as previously mentioned.[12] With less biodiversity, this ecosystem is less adaptable to when disasters strike it[11][8] It has a smaller available food supply, in terms of plants, for animals, who then may die out or more likely may relocate. Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil. In the northern Chinese province alone, 400 million are affected every year with an associated 54 billion yuan of annual economic loss due to grassland degradation. A:","output":"A: Based on the provided information, it is most likely that indigenous animals in Costa Rica would survive and stay put. This is because Costa Rica has preserved its pristine forests, maintaining its biodiversity. In contrast, Nicaragua has cleared vast tracts of forests for sugarcane production, leading to a decline in biodiversity. As mentioned in the hint, degraded land with less biodiversity is less adaptable to disasters and provides a smaller food supply for animals. In these conditions, animals may either die out or choose to relocate. Therefore, the intact forests and preserved ecosystems in Costa Rica make it more conducive for indigenous animals to survive and remain in their natural habitats."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is because he learned about mammal reproduction, which primarily involves internal fertilization (where fertilization occurs inside the mother's body). On the other hand, Tim learned about fish reproduction, where in the majority of species, fertilization takes place outside the mother's body."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Bath withstood severe pressure after the break, but their defence finally buckled when Schalk Brits crossed with 10 minutes left. Hodgson then added two late penalties to secure victory for Sarries, their biggest league comeback in history. Victory stretched Saracens' lead at the top of the table to seven points, with second-placed Exeter travelling to Worcester on Sunday. Relive Saturday's Premiership action Defeat was tough on Mike Ford's side, who produced a superb defensive display after the interval, at one stage spending almost 10 minutes camped inside their own 22 yet surviving unscathed. But Bath - beaten by Saracens in the Premiership final only eight months ago - could not avoid a sixth league defeat in nine matches. Since lifting the trophy at Twickenham, Mark McCall's men have been in imperious form, winning their opening eight Premiership games in 2015-16 before losing to Harlequins on their most recent league outing on 9 January. Trailing 13-6 after 70 minutes, Saracens drew level when Brits wriggled over after an eye-catching break from England hopeful Maro Itoje. Hodgson, who had kicked two penalties before converting Brits' score, landed two more three-pointers in the final seven minutes to seal victory. Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall: \\"If Maro keeps on playing like that, I'm sure he'll get an opportunity [with England]. I thought he was really good in the second half; every carry made a difference. \\"We were very composed at half-time - Brad Barritt led the team magnificently. \\"We didn't think we played too badly in the first half. We just needed to pressurise them, use the wind and improve our set-piece. \\"Once we got in front I thought we were magnificent. We had 15 minutes of almost perfect rugby.\\" Bath head coach Mike Ford: \\"I'm proud of the first half, proud of the performance. The boys got stuck in. \\"There's 13 league games left for us; there's another two before we reach halfway. We have to accumulate to get to the top four and we're going to go for it. \\"Saracens conceded six penalties from mauls and didn't get anyone in the sin bin, not even a talking-to. \\"[Richard] Wigglesworth kicks it dead from the halfway line, it's our scrum feed and the referee rules that it's us to be penalised on our own ball and we're under pressure again. \\"It's small margins and you need that rub of the green with the referee.\\" Saracens: Ransom; Taylor, Bosch, Barritt (capt), Wyles; Hodgson, Wigglesworth; Barrington, Brits, Du Plessis, Itoje, Hamilton, Rhodes, Burger, Wray.

The nearly eight-minute long recording was released by ProPublica, an independent, investigative news site. ProPublica says an unidentified whistleblower passed on the recording to a civil rights attorney, who gave it to the website. Among the disturbing sounds heard on the recording was a child identified by ProPublica as a six-year-old girl from El Salvador begging authorities in Spanish to call her aunt to pick her up from the detention center.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. You will need to reward your dog when he shakes. Bite-sized treats are good for training because you can give your dog more of them without feeding them too many extra calories. Also consider what your dog likes and what will motivate them: does your dog like soft treats or hard treats? Is there a certain flavor that your dog seems to respond to more? Figure out which treat works best for your particular dog and have them on-hand for training.  Try making your own treats.  These could be small pieces of cooked meat or even some fruits and vegetables. Don't overfeed your dog.  Keep treat sizes as small as you can. Do not feed your dog the following food items, as they can cause poisoning or illness: avocado, chocolate, bread dough, grapes, raisins, hops, ethanol, moldy foods, macadamia nuts, xylitol, onions, garlic. The only way a dog can shake hands is if they are sitting.  If your dog doesn't know how the command for sit, you will need to teach them to sit first. Don't reward the dog with the treat here, as you are teaching him how to shake, not sit. You won't be giving the treat to your dog just yet.  For now, simply keep the treat in your left hand.  Bring the treat in front of your dogs nose, showing it to him.  Once you have his attention, close your fist around the treat.  Don't let the dog grab the treat from you yet. Hold the treat between your thumb and your palm. \\" This is the command you will use to ask your dog to shake (you can also say something else like \\"Shake\\" if you prefer).

When they make a move toward the behavior you want — such as lifting a paw to try and get the treat from your fist — say \\"Yes!\\" with a lot of enthusiasm and excitement and give them the treat.  When your dog makes a move toward the behavior you want, immediately reward them with the treat. Ignore any other attempts your dog may make, such as sniffing or mouthing your hand.  Be patient. Practice this way a few times until the dog is reliably lifting their paw when you say \\"Paw.\\" Once your dog is lifting their paw on command, you will want to take it to the next step. You should begin reward the dog only as they do something closer to your goal of shaking. For instance, if your dog lifts their paw higher than before, that gets a \\"Yes!\\" and a treat, but not before then. Continue in this way until the dog is offering their paw. Use this additional step only if your dog doesn't seem to paw at the treat in your hand.  By picking up your dogs paw, and praising them during and after, you start to show your dog that pawing at your hand is rewarded.  Hold the paw for a few seconds before rewarding.

Movie title: Battle for the Planet of the Apes Context: Set in a flashback in the former North American continent of the early 21st century in the year 2003, and told by the Great Lawgiver, this latest Planet of the Apes sequel focuses on the chimpanzee ape leader, Caesar (Roddy McDowall), more then a decade after he led the ape revolution in the previous film, 'Conquest of the Planet of the Apes'. In this post-nuclear war society, Caesar tries to cultivate peace between his simian peers and the surviving remains of humanity. A militant gorilla general named Aldo (Claude Akins) however opposes this. Therefore, he plots Caesar's overthrow and doom. Caesar is now married to the chimpanzee Lisa (Natalie Trundy), the female chimpanzee ape of the previous film, and they have a son, named Cornelius (Bobby Porter) in honor of Caesar's late father.Caesar regrets having never known his parents until his human assistant MacDonald (Austin Stoker) informs him that by viewing video taped archives of his parents, he can learn about the future. Caesar learns the archives are in the Forbidden City, once the city in which Caesar was enslaved, and is now in nuclear ruins.After obtaining weapons from an armory run by the orangutan Mandemus (Lew Ayres), Caesar travels with MacDonald and the orangutan Virgil (Paul Williams) to the Forbidden City and sneaks in to find the recorded archives. However, there are radiation-scarred humans still living in the Forbidden City, now under the command of Governor Kolp (Severn Darden), the former police chief under the late Governor Beck and who is now the current leader and governor. Caesar and his party view the video recordings of Cornelius and Zira (from 'Escape from the Planet of the Apes') and learn about the future of the world, but barely have enough time to study the tapes before they must escape or risk capture or death.Back in Ape City, Caesar assembles a meeting with the citizens to report his discoveries at the Forbidden City.

For instance, testing when we assume that the behavior of the implementation under test can be denoted by a deterministic finite-state machine for some known finite sets of inputs and outputs and with some known number of states belongs to Class I (and all subsequent classes). However, if the number of states is not known, then it only belongs to all classes from Class II on. If the implementation under test must be a deterministic finite-state machine failing the specification for a single trace (and its continuations), and its number of states is unknown, then it only belongs to classes from Class III on. Testing temporal machines where transitions are triggered if inputs are produced within some real-bounded interval only belongs to classes from Class IV on, whereas testing many non-deterministic systems only belongs to Class V (but not all, and some even belong to Class I). The inclusion into Class I does not require the simplicity of the assumed computation model, as some testing cases involving implementations written in any programming language, and testing implementations defined as machines depending on continuous magnitudes, have been proved to be in Class I.

The first sentence, \\"Heavy equipment leveling the sand on a nice beach,\\" provides information about an action involving heavy machinery and the location where it is taking place. Although we understand that heavy equipment is performing the task, it does not explicitly mention people operating the machinery, nor does it specify the time or date of the event. The second sentence, \\"People are working today,\\" focuses on people working on a particular day. It does not establish whether the people working are related to those operating the heavy equipment, or if they are involved in another profession entirely. Furthermore, the sentence does not provide any context to the type of work being performed, the location, or whether it occurs during the same time period as the beach leveling. Considering these factors, we cannot definitively conclude that the sentence \\"People are working today.\\" is true based only on the given context. Although it is reasonable to assume that people are operating the heavy equipment mentioned in the first sentence, that simply isn't enough evidence to confirm that the second sentence is true.

Avenged Sevenfold (sometimes abbreviated as A7X) is an American heavy metal band from Huntington Beach, California, formed in 1999. The band's current lineup consists of lead vocalist M. Shadows, rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist Zacky Vengeance, lead guitarist and backing vocalist Synyster Gates, bassist and backing vocalist Johnny Christ, and drummer Brooks Wackerman. Avenged Sevenfold is known for its diverse rock sound and dramatic imagery in album covers and merchandise. Avenged Sevenfold emerged with a metalcore sound on the band's debut Sounding the Seventh Trumpet and continued this sound through their second album Waking the Fallen. The band's influences include Guns N' Roses, Iron Maiden, Megadeth, Pantera, Bad Religion, Dream Theater, Motorhead, Metallica, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, In Flames, At the Gates, Helloween, Queensryche, System of a Down, AC/DC, NOFX, Alice in Chains, Black Flag, Corrosion of Conformity, Suicidal Tendencies, Misfits, Slayer, The Vandals, Soundgarden, Rage Against the Machine, Korn, Slipknot, Deftones, Beastie Boys, Biohazard, Type O Negative, Anthrax and AFI.  The band has been categorized under many genres of heavy music. Mainly categorized as heavy metal, hard rock, progressive metal and metalcore, Avenged Sevenfold's music has evolved over most of the band's career. At first, the band's debut album Sounding the Seventh Trumpet consisted almost entirely of a metalcore sound; however, there were several deviations from this genre, most notably in \\"Streets\\", which shows a punk rock style, and \\"Warmness on the Soul\\", which is a piano ballad. On Waking the Fallen, the band displayed a metalcore style once more, but added more clean singing and leaned a bit more towards metal and bit less close to hardcore. In the band's DVD All Excess, producer Andrew Murdock explained this transition: \\"When I met the band after Sounding the Seventh Trumpet had come out before they had recorded Waking the Fallen, M. Shadows said to me 'This record is screaming. The record we want to make is going to be half-screaming half-singing. I don't want to scream anymore. And the record after that is going to be all singing'.\\"  On City of Evil, Avenged Sevenfold's third album, the band chose to abandon the metalcore genre, using a more hard rock and heavy metal style. Avenged Sevenfold's self-titled album, however, has some experiments with other music genres than that from City of Evil, most notably in \\"Dear God\\", which shows a country style and \\"A Little Piece of Heaven\\", which is circled within the influence of Broadway show tunes, using primarily brass instruments and stringed orchestra to take over most of the role of the lead and rhythm guitar. Nightmare contains further deviations, including a piano ballad called \\"Fiction\\", progressive metal-oriented track \\"Save Me\\" and a heavy metal sound with extreme vocals and heavier instrumentation on \\"God Hates Us\\". The band's sixth studio album Hail to the King shows more of a classic metal sound and a riff-oriented approach. On their newest album The Stage, the band explores further into progressive metal, blending it with elements of thrash metal. In the past, Avenged Sevenfold has also been described as alternative metal, screamo, and pop punk metal.  The band has been criticized for \\"not being metal enough\\". Vocalist M. Shadows responded to this with, \\"we play music for the sake of music, not so that we can be labeled a metal band. That's like telling us we aren't punk enough. Who cares?\\" Avenged Sevenfold is one of the notable acts of the New Wave of American Heavy Metal.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did they have other bands that they styled their sound from?","output":"Yes, Avenged Sevenfold had other bands that they styled their sound from.

Rose, an autodidact with a dominating presence, supervised his music and literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From his earliest lessons, Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic culture; writing late in life, he said that the Icelandic Saga of Grettir the Strong was \\"the strongest single artistic influence on my life\\". As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie in art rather than music. At the age of 10 he began studying piano under Louis Pabst, a German immigrant then considered to be Melbourne's leading piano teacher. Grainger's first known composition, \\"A Birthday Gift to Mother\\", is dated 1893. Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894, at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building. The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance delighted the Melbourne critics, who dubbed him \\"the flaxen-haired phenomenon who plays like a master\\". This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at  the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany, an institution recommended by William Laver, head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music.

He rushed into the classical music scene at the age of 12 after Itzhak Perlman, the famed violinist, heard him play. But nothing in his family history explains where Haimovitz got his extraordinary talent. And that's typical, Ellen Winner, a professor says. \\"People are fascinated by these children because they don't understand where their talent came from. You will see parents who say, 'I wasn't like this, and my husband wasn't like this.' It seems to sometimes just come out of the blue,\\" Winner says. It's not clear whether a prodigy's  brain is any different from the brains of other children, in part because there have been no study comparing the brains of prodigies to those of average people. \\"But I believe that anything that shows up so early, without training, has got to be either a genetic or some other biological basis,\\" Winner says. \\"If a child suddenly at the age of 3 goes to the piano and picks out a tune and does it beautifully, that has to be because that child has a different brain.\\" Children who are extremely gifted tend to be socially different, too, Winner says. \\"They feel like they can't find other kids like themselves, so they feel strange, maybe even like a freak, and feel like they don't have anybody to connect with. On the other hand, they also long to connect with other kids, and they can't find other kids like themselves.\\" As Haimovitz got older, he became frustrated. He wanted to play other kinds of music but felt constricted by the image and the expectations of the boy prodigy who played classical music and filled concert halls. \\"When you start that early, you suddenly start to grow up in public, and I wanted to experiment,\\" Haimovitz says. So he took his cello into punk rock clubs and coffee houses. He played Bach, Haydn and Hendrix. \\"My teacher was Leonard Rose, and we never played any 20th-century music. He didn't like it.

Translate to English","output":"According to tradition, on the evening of Christmas Eve, families gather at home and sing songs and have fun in honor of the birth of Jesus. The Christmas season has long been celebrated around the world as a time for families and communities to come together to rejoice and share in the spirit of giving and love. One of the most dearly held traditions during this time is the gathering of family members on Christmas Eve: the evening before Christmas Day, when the birth of Jesus Christ is commemorated. In many cultures, it is customary for families to come together on this special night to share a festive meal, exchange gifts, and participate in a variety of activities that highlight the importance of togetherness. One such activity is singing Christmas carols, which are songs performed in celebration of the Christmas season and the birth of Jesus. Caroling is believed to have originated in Europe during the medieval period, where groups of singers would travel from house to house, singing hymns and spreading holiday cheer. Over time, the tradition evolved and became more focused on bringing family and friends together on Christmas Eve, as they joined their voices in song to celebrate the true meaning of the holiday. The birth of Jesus is honored through these Christmas carols, many of which contain lyrics retelling the story of his miraculous arrival in Bethlehem. During these gatherings, family members young and old may take turns singing their favorite Christmas carols or performing them on musical instruments. Some families also invite friends and neighbors to join in the celebration, further fostering a sense of community and togetherness during this special time of year. In addition to singing, families may participate in other traditional activities on Christmas Eve, such as decorating the Christmas tree, attending a midnight church service, or enjoying a special meal. This meal may consist of traditional dishes from the family's cultural heritage, or it may simply be a feast featuring the family's favorite foods. Whatever form these activities take, their purpose is the same: to bring loved ones together in a spirit of joy and gratitude, in celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ. In conclusion, the tradition of gathering at home on Christmas Eve to sing songs and have fun in honor of the birth of Jesus stems from a long and cherished history of families and communities coming together to celebrate this special time of year. The sharing of songs, stories, food, and gifts serves as a powerful symbol of unity and love, reminding us all of the deeper meaning behind the Christmas season, and the values that bring us together."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Across the globe, a wide assortment of queens – both real and legendary – have graced the pages of historical records, literature, and folklore. These influential women have forever left their mark on the world, as they have contributed to the advancement of politics, culture, and society in their respective nations. In this article, we will attempt to delve deep into the rich tapestry of history to explore and enumerate the various queens mentioned throughout time. A disclaimer: Given the vast abundance of queens who have been documented, this article shall only provide a snapshot of the most prominent figures to have ever donned the royal crown. Let's begin our fascinating journey. Methodology To answer the question of how many different queens have been mentioned, we delved into a wide range of resources, including academic databases, historical accounts, biographies, and literary references. We classified the queens based on their geopolitical regions and the time frames in which they reigned. We have also included queens who played significant roles in mythology and popular culture. The Queens of Europe Europe, being the birthplace of countless monarchies, has seen more than its fair share of queens. Some of the most prominent historical figures in European history include: 1. Queen Elizabeth I of England (1533-1603): Often regarded as one of the most influential queens in history, Elizabeth I oversaw the growth and prosperity of England during the Elizabethan Era. 2. Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom (1819-1901): Under Victoria's reign, Britain transformed into a global superpower, expanding its empire and industrializing its economy. 3. Catherine the Great of Russia (1729-1796): Catherine significantly expanded the borders of her vast empire and promoted education, arts, and sciences. 4. Isabella I of Castile (1451-1504): As a strong and effective ruler, Queen Isabella united Spain and oversaw the discovery of the New World by Christopher Columbus. Queens of the Middle Ages and ancient European history also captured the fascination of many, such as Eleanor of Aquitaine (1122-1204), Matilda of Flanders (1032-1083), and one of history's earliest queens, Boudica (circa 30-60 AD) of the British Celtic Iceni tribe. Queens of Asia, Africa, and the Americas Asian history, particularly that of ancient civilizations, has also produced significant queens who displayed immense power and influence. Notable examples include: 1. Empress Wu Zetian of China (624-705): As the only female emperor in Chinese history, Wu Zetian ruled during the Tang Dynasty and expanded the empire during her reign. 2. Queen Seondeok of Silla (606-647): Seondeok is revered as Korea's first queen regnant – a capable leader who laid the groundwork for the unification of the three Korean kingdoms. In Africa, queens such as Cleopatra VII of Egypt (69-30 BC), Amanitore of Nubia (circa 50 CE), and Yaa Asantewaa of the Ashanti Empire (circa 1660-1720) have gone down in history for their military prowess, strong leadership, and cultural impact. Queens from the Americas, such as the Aztec Queen Xochitl, Inca Queen Coya, and Anacaona of Haiti, have also significantly contributed to their respective civilizations. Mythological and Legendary Queens Mythology and folklore are replete with tales of powerful queens who have captured the imagination of people across generations. Some popular examples include: 1. Queen Himiko of Japan: This legendary queen has long been associated with mystery and myth, having ruled Japan during the third century. 2. Helen of Troy: Often hailed as the \\"face that launched a thousand ships,\\" Helen was an enchanting queen whose beauty was believed to have ignited the devastating Trojan War. 3. Queen Guinevere of Britain: This queen is a central figure in the Arthurian legend, famous for her love affair with Sir Lancelot. Conclusion So, how many different queens were mentioned? The answer is a staggering number - hundreds, if not thousands. Each queen, real or legendary, has her own unique story that has helped shape human history and inspire countless others. Compiling a complete list remains a Herculean task; however, this article aimed to provide a glimpse into the lives of some of the most iconic queens who have, in one way or another, left an indelible mark on the rich tapestry of our global heritage."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

NLAP was created in 1968. A decade later, the agency used a 50,000 LSC grant to buy a building at 438 King St. in Charleston and 33,000 to buy a building at 201 King St. in Georgetown, according to Erlenborn's letter to Kaynard. In 1980, NLAP used 63,000 in LSC funds to buy property at 607 Main St. in Conway, the letter said. On Nov. 14, 2001, NLAP transferred title of the King Street building in Charleston to the Charleston County Bar Association, according to county property records. The local bar paid 5 for the building, which sits between a redeveloped office building and an antique shop. The local bar said it would maintain the building for \\"legal services to indigent residents of Charleston County and coastal South Carolina,\\" the records said. The King Street building appears to be vacant. Notices at the entrance direct visitors to the equal justice center on West Montague Avenue in North Charleston. E. Douglas Pratt-Thomas, president of the local bar, was not available for comment. Charleston County has not appraised the King Street property because it is tax-exempt. But Randall Goldman, managing partner of Patrick Properties, which owns buildings from 440 to 456 King St., said he estimates 438 King St. would sell for between 700,000 and 900,000. \\"That building, which was purchased solely with federal legal aid dollars, should be used to provide legal services for poor people in South Carolina,\\" Kleiman said. LSC wants the title to go to the equal justice center in Charleston or \\"we want 100 percent of the proceeds from the sale of the building to stay in Charleston. We are not contemplating taking that money out of South Carolina,\\" he said. Kleiman said if the neighborhood legal program in Charleston \\"had honored their obligation, this would not be an issue.\\"  Question: \\"How many years after buying buildings in Charleston and Georgetown did the NLAP buy again?\\" Answer: \\"12 years\\" Is this answer correct?

Later, in 1980, NLAP used 63,000 in LSC funds to buy property at 607 Main St. in Conway.

Plot title: Sling Blade Movie plot: Karl Childers (Billy Bob Thornton) is an intellectually disabled Arkansas man who has been in the custody of the state mental hospital since the age of 12 for having killed his mother and her lover. Although thoroughly institutionalized, Karl is deemed fit to be released into the outside world. Prior to his release, he is interviewed by a local college newspaper reporter, to whom he recounts committing the murders with a Kaiser blade, saying, \\"Some folks call it a sling blade. I call it a kaiser blade.\\" Karl says he thought the man was raping his mother. When he discovered that his mother was a willing participant in the affair, he killed her also. Thanks to the doctor in charge of his institutionalization (James Hampton), Karl lands a job at a repair shop in the small town where he was born and raised. He befriends 12-year-old Frank Wheatley (Lucas Black) and shares some of the details of his past, including the killings. Frank reveals that his father was killed - hit by a train - leaving him and his mother on their own. He later admits that he lied, and that his father committed suicide. Frank introduces Karl to his mother, Linda (Natalie Canerday), as well as her gay friend, Vaughan Cunningham (John Ritter), the manager of the dollar store where she is employed. Despite Vaughan's concerns about Karl's history in the mental hospital, Linda allows him to move into her garage, which angers Linda's abusive alcoholic boyfriend, Doyle Hargraves (Dwight Yoakam). Karl bonds with Linda, who makes him biscuits to eat, and also with Vaughan, who tells Karl that a gay man and a mentally challenged man face similar obstacles of intolerance and ridicule in small-town America. Karl quickly becomes a father figure to Frank, who misses his father and despises Doyle. Karl is haunted by the task given to him by his parents when he was six or eight years old to dispose of his premature, unwanted, newborn brother. He visits his father (Robert Duvall), who has become a mentally unbalanced hermit living in the dilapidated home...

Given the question: Jonathan Swift said, “Everybody wants to live forever, but nobody wants to grow old.”  Wouldn’t it be nice if we could stay healthy and young and live as long as possible? Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process. So, our question for today is: What are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet? First, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life – although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life. What has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, stroke, heart diseases, etc. That alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that. Unfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. – basically empty calories. Obesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole. There is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries – it’s easier and tastier. What will likely happen to those who continue to eat burgers and cheese fries?  A. not enough information  B. they will have an increased risk of disease  C. they will enjoy their food more  D. they will be healthier than those who don't The answer is:","output":"B. they will have an increased risk of disease"},{"instruction":"Carson was trying to figure out how to get to their wife's workplace.

Movie title: The Virgin Suicides Context: The story takes place in the suburbs of Grosse Pointe, Michigan during the mid-1970s, as a group of neighborhood boys, now grown men acknowledging in voice-over (narrated by Giovanni Ribisi who speaks for the group as a whole) reflect upon their memories of the five Lisbon sisters, ages 13 to 17. Unattainable due to their Catholic and overprotective, authoritarian parents, math teacher Ronald (James Woods) and his homemaker wife (Kathleen Turner), the girlsâTherese (Leslie Hayman), Mary (A. J. Cook), Bonnie (Chelse Swain), Lux (Kirsten Dunst), and Cecilia (Hanna R. Hall)âare the enigma that fill the boys' conversations and dreams. The film opens in the summer with the suicide attempt of the youngest sister, Cecilia, as she slits her wrist in a bath. After her parents allow her to throw a chaperoned basement party intended to make her feel better, Cecilia excuses herself and jumps out of her second story bedroom window, dying when she is impaled on an iron fence below. In the wake of her act, the Lisbon parents watch over their four remaining daughters even more closely. This further isolates the family from the community and heightens air of mystery about the girls to the neighborhood boys in particular. At the beginning of the new school year in the fall, Lux forms a secret and short-lived romance with Trip Fontaine (Josh Hartnett), the school heartthrob. Trip comes over one night to the Lisbon residence in hopes of getting closer to Lux and watches television with the family. Soon Trip persuades Mr. Lisbon to allow him to take Lux to the upcoming Homecoming Dance by promising to provide dates for the other sisters, to go as a group. After winning Homecoming king and queen, Trip persuades Lux to ditch the group and have sex on the school's football field. Afterwards, Lux falls asleep on the grass, and Trip, becoming disenchanted by Lux, abandons her. At dawn, Lux wakes up alone and has to take a taxi home. Having broken curfew, Lux and her sisters are punished by a paranoid Mrs. Lisbon by being taken out...

We have the equation: 0 = 432*y - 426*y - 66 First, we can combine the terms with \\"y\\" in them. So we will subtract 426*y from 432*y: (432 - 426) * y = 6 * y Now the equation looks like: 0 = 6*y - 66 Next, we need to get \\"y\\" all by itself on one side of the equation. To do that, let's add 66 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 66 = 6*y - 66 + 66 This simplifies to: 66 = 6*y Now, we will divide both sides of the equation by 6 to isolate \\"y\\": 66 ÷ 6 = 6*y ÷ 6 This gives us the answer: y = 11 So, the value of y in the equation is 11.

The city was gray but the buildings contrasted with dirt red. The morning settled my nerves a bit more and before long the train pulled into the station. Boston had a slower feel, much slower than New York. The air was cool and peppered with moisture. I knew I was close to the ocean. Vision blurry, I wobbled out of the train depot and thought about the fact that I had never really done anything crazy in my life. The colors meant something here. Green was the color of plants but it was also the color of money. Plants were good but money was bad. I didn't know what green meant. Blue and red were clear though. Blue was the color of ocean and sky, both good things. Red was the color of Mars and it was manly but mars meant aliens and aliens were bad so red was bad. This is how I navigated. I followed the colors. I was lost in a daze of exhaustion and moved my feet slowly. They were dead and raw with pain and blisters, and I shuffled out into the city. My eyes darted from color to color, sign to sign, connection to connection. I floated like a ghost and thought about crying. There were few people out so I found a relative ease in that but my mind still jumped around reckless. I needed to find Kim. I saw a silent pay phone with a dangling phonebook and headed towards it until I remembered that phone books don't normally list cell phones. Kim wasn't the type of girl to list herself in the phonebook either.

In 1965, the activity on the main island diminished, but at the end of May that year an eruption began at a vent 0.6 km (0.37 mi) off the northern shore. By 28 May, an island had appeared, and was named Syrtlingur (Little Surtsey). The new island was washed away during early June, but reappeared on 14 June. Eruptions at Syrtlingur were much smaller in scale than those that had built Surtsey, with the average rate of emission of volcanic materials being about a tenth of the rate at the main vent. Activity was short-lived, continuing until the beginning of October 1965, by which time the islet had an area of 0.15 km2 (0.058 sq mi). Once the eruptions had ceased, wave erosion rapidly wore the island away, and it disappeared beneath the waves on 24 October.During December 1965, more submarine activity occurred 0.9 km (0.56 mi) southwest of Surtsey, and another island was formed. It was named Jólnir, and over the following eight months it appeared and disappeared several times, as wave erosion and volcanic activity alternated in dominance. Activity at Jólnir was much weaker than the activity at the main vent, and even weaker than that seen at Syrtlingur, but the island eventually grew to a maximum size of 70 m (230 ft) in height, covering an area of 0.3 km2 (0.12 sq mi), during July and early August 1966. Like Syrtlingur, though, after activity ceased on 8 August 1966, it was rapidly eroded, and dropped below sea level during October 1966.Effusive eruptions on the main island returned on 19 August 1966, with fresh lava flows giving it further resistance to erosion. The eruption rate diminished steadily, though, and on 5 June 1967, the eruption ended. The volcano has been dormant ever since. The total volume of lava emitted during the three-and-a-half-year eruption was about one cubic kilometre (0.24 cu mi), and the island's highest point was 174 metres (571 feet) above sea level at that time.Since the end of the eruption, erosion has seen the island diminish in size.

Here is an article: From left, Robertson Carricart, Joyce Cohen, Mark Saturno and Marion Wood in John Ferguson, a play that first opened in New York in 1919. The Mint Theaters production of John Ferguson is one of those lovely little surprises that pop up occasionally in the wildly uneven world of Off Off Broadway. In a cramped third-floor theater in a tiny Times Square office building, this is a thoroughly engrossing, fully realized drama brought to life by an ensemble of actors who never miss a beat. They play a small-town Irish farm family threatened with eviction and the local characters who get involved. John Ferguson (Robertson Carricart), a man who believes that God has a reason for everything that happens, reads his Bible by firelight. His daughter, Hannah (Marion Wood), happily basks in the love of her family until she realizes that the only way to save its farm is to marry James Caesar (Mark Saturno), a nice but creepy guy who makes her cringe. When she says yes to Jimmy (Ill have you), her mother, Sarah (Joyce Cohen), is thrilled. Her father struggles with himself, trying to believe that the marriage is really what Hannah wants. It has come to this because the Fergusons were expecting a check from Johns brother in the United States. When the mailman confirms that no letter has come, all seems lost. Henry Witherow (Greg Thornton), who holds the mortgage, pays a visit, just to establish his despicability. Grandly directed by Martin Platt, the cast does not have a weak link, but Ms. Wood deserves particular praise. There are a hundred ways for her to go wrong in her reaction to, and transformation by, an unspeakable violation, but she never does. Justin Schultz, as Andrew, Hannahs gentle but seething brother, spends a good deal of Act II half-cowering against a wall with the intensity of a smarter Boo Radley. The village semi-idiot, John McGrath (John Keating), known as Clutie, functions as both comic relief and Greek chorus (and a reminder that being homeless is a lot easier when neighbors share their food and offer hay lofts for sleeping). Critics adored John Ferguson, which was written by St. John Ervine, when it opened in New York in 1919. Even now, when American audiences sometimes deal with stage tragedy by looking for laughs, it is compelling. John Ferguson continues through Oct. 15 at the Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton; (212)315-9434. A review in The Arts on Wednesday of the play John Ferguson referred incorrectly to the production. It is playing Off Broadway, not Off Off Broadway.

An efficient way to do this is by using a dynamic programming algorithm. Here is how I would approach this: Implementation in Python, would look something like this: 1. First, we'd initialize our variables:    String A = \\"UbIYvCyAzXyRkEngU\\"    String B = \\"SMoCyAzXyRfa\\"        The \`maxLength\` is used to retain the length of the longest found common substring and \`maxLengthEnd\` is used to retain the end index of the longest common substring in String A. 2. Next, build a \`DP\` matrix where \`DP[i][j]\` holds the length of the common substring ending at \`i in A\` and \`j in B\`. The matrix will be of size (n+1) x (m+1), where n, m are the lengths of String A and B respectively. We add 1 to accommodate for the zeroth row and column, which represents an empty substring in A and B. 3. Now, iterate over each cell of the matrix. If the end characters of the current substring in both A and B are equal, that is, A[i-1] == B[j-1], then DP[i][j] will be DP[i-1][j-1], which is the length of the longest common substring found till now, plus 1.  4. Check if \`DP[i][j] > maxLength\`. If so, update \`maxLength\` to \`DP[i][j]\` and \`maxLengthEnd\` to \`i-1\`. 5. After completing the iteration, the longest common substring will be found from index (\`maxLengthEnd - maxLength + 1\`) to \`maxLengthEnd\` in A. 6. Return the longest common substring. By running this dynamic programming algorithm on the given Strings A and B, the longest common substring is \\"CyAzXyR\\". This algorithm works by iteratively finding the common substrings of A and B ending at each index i, j in A and B. It then checks and updates the longest found common substring.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: Where was the man who's musical career was interrupted in 1896 principal conductor in 1907? is inside the article: Monteux's first high-profile conducting experience came in 1895, when he was barely 20 years old. He was a member of the orchestra engaged for a performance of Saint-Saëns's oratorio La lyre et la harpe, to be conducted by the composer. At the last minute Saint-Saëns judged the player engaged for the important and difficult organ part to be inadequate and, as a celebrated virtuoso organist, decided to play it himself. He asked the orchestra if any of them could take over as conductor; there was a chorus of \\"Oui – Monteux!\\". With great trepidation, Monteux conducted the orchestra and soloists including the composer, sight-reading the score, and was judged a success.Monteux's musical career was interrupted in 1896, when he was called up for military service. As a graduate of the Conservatoire, one of France's grandes écoles, he was required to serve only ten months rather than the three years generally required. He later described himself as \\"the most pitifully inadequate soldier that the 132nd Infantry had ever seen\\". He had inherited from his mother not only her musical talent but her short and portly build and was physically unsuited to soldiering.Returning to Paris after discharge, Monteux resumed his career as a violist. Hans Richter invited him to lead the violas in the Bayreuth Festival orchestra, but Monteux could not afford to leave his regular work in Paris. In December 1900 Monteux played the solo viola part in Berlioz's Harold in Italy, rarely heard in Paris at the time, with the Colonne Orchestra conducted by Felix Mottl. In 1902 he secured a junior conducting post at the Dieppe casino, a seasonal appointment for the summer months which brought him into contact with leading musicians from the Paris orchestras and well-known soloists on vacation. By 1907 he was the principal conductor at Dieppe, in charge of operas and orchestral concerts. As an orchestral conductor he modelled his technique on that of Arthur Nikisch, under whose baton he had played, and who was his ideal conductor., can you guess it ?

A game developer can range from one person who undertakes all tasks to a large business with employee responsibilities split between individual disciplines, such as programming, design, art, testing, etc. Most game development companies have video game publisher financial and usually marketing support. Self-funded developers are known as independent or indie developers and usually make indie games.  - , sometimes transliterated Gumpei Yokoi, was a Japanese video game designer. He was a long-time Nintendo employee, best known as creator of the Game & Watch handheld system, inventor of the Control Pad (whose plus-shaped design nearly all video game controllers attempt to mimic today), the original designer of the Game Boy, and producer of a few long-running and critically acclaimed video game franchises, such as \\"Metroid\\" and \\"Kid Icarus\\".  - Atari Corporation was an American manufacturer of computers and video game consoles from 1984 to 1996. Atari Corp. was founded in July 1984 when Warner Communications sold the home computing and game console divisions of Atari, Inc. to Jack Tramiel. Its chief products were the Atari ST, , Atari 7800, Atari Lynx, and Atari Jaguar. The company reverse merged with JTS Inc. in 1996, becoming a small division, which itself closed when JTS liquidated the IP to Hasbro Interactive in 1998.  - The Nintendo Entertainment System (commonly abbreviated as NES) is an 8-bit home video game console that was developed and manufactured by Nintendo. The best-selling gaming console of its time, the NES helped revitalize the US video game industry following the video game crash of 1983. With the NES, Nintendo introduced a now-standard business model of licensing third-party developers, authorizing them to produce and distribute titles for Nintendo's platform.  - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming.  - Cross-promotion is a form of marketing promotion where customers of one product or service are targeted with promotion of a related product. A typical example is cross-media marketing of a brand, for example Oprah Winfrey's promotion on her television show of her books, magazines and website. Cross-promotion may involve two or more companies working together in promoting a service or product, in a way that benefits both. For example, a mobile phone network may work together with a popular music artist and package some of their songs as exclusive ringtones; promoting these ringtones can benefit both the network and the artist. Some major corporations, for example Burger King, have a long history of cross-promotion with a range of partners (see Burger King advertising). The Disney Channel has also made extensive use of cross-promotion. Movie tie-ins are good examples of cross-promotion. On occasion, badly planned cross-promotions can backfire spectacularly such as 1992 Hoover free flights promotion fiasco.  - A tie-in work is a work of fiction or other product based on a media property such as a film, video game, television series, board game, web site, role-playing game or literary property. Tie-ins are authorized by the owners of the original property, and are a form of cross-promotion used primarily to generate additional income from that property and to promote its visibility.  - The megabyte is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information. Its recommended unit symbol is MB, but sometimes \\"MByte\\" is used. The unit prefix \\"mega\\" is a multiplier of (10) in the International System of Units (SI). Therefore, one megabyte is one million bytes of information. This definition has been incorporated into the International System of Quantities.  - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as \\"Pong\\" and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s.  - Guinness World Records, known from its inception in 1955 until 1998 as The Guinness Book of Records and in previous U.S. editions as The Guinness Book of World Records, is a reference book published annually, listing world records and national records, both of human achievements and the extremes of the natural world. The book itself holds a world record, as the best-selling copyrighted book of all time. As of the 2017 edition, it is now in its 63rd year of publication, published in 100 countries and 23 languages. The international franchise has extended beyond print to include television series and museums. The popularity of the franchise has resulted in \\"Guinness World Records\\" becoming the primary international authority on the cataloguing and verification of a huge number of world records; the organisation employs official record adjudicators authorised to verify the authenticity of the setting and breaking of records.  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - Real-time strategy (RTS) is a subgenre of strategy video games where the game does not progress incrementally in turns.  - Dundee, officially the City of Dundee, is Scotland's fourth-largest city and the 51st-most-populous built-up area in the United Kingdom. The mid-year population estimate for 2015 was 148,210 which gave Dundee a population density of 2,477/km or 6,420/sq mi, the second-highest in Scotland. It lies within the eastern central Lowlands on the north bank of the Firth of Tay, which feeds into the North Sea. Under the name of \\"Dundee City\\", it forms one of the 32 council areas used for local government in Scotland.  - The Motorola 68000 (\\"'sixty-eight-thousand'\\"; also called the m68k or Motorola 68k, \\"\\"sixty-eight-kay\\"\\") is a 32-bit CISC microprocessor with a 16-bit external data bus, designed and marketed by Motorola Semiconductor Products Sector (later Freescale Semiconductor, now NXP). Introduced in 1979 with HMOS technology as the first member of the successful 32-bit m68k family of microprocessors, it is generally software forward compatible with the rest of the line despite being limited to a 16-bit wide external bus. After 37 years in production, the 68000 architecture is still in use.  - The Game Boy line is a line of handheld game consoles developed, manufactured, and marketed by Nintendo. The product line has sold 200 million units worldwide.  - A microprocessor is a computer processor which incorporates the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) on a single integrated circuit (IC), or at most a few integrated circuits. The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock driven, register based, programmable electronic device which accepts digital or binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic. Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary numeral system.  - A role-playing game (RPG and sometimes roleplaying game) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting or through a process of structured decision-making or character development. Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines.  - Abandoning previous ventures in favor of toys in the 1960s, Nintendo then developed into a video game company in the 1970s, ultimately becoming one of the most influential in the industry and Japan's third most-valuable company with a market value of over 85 billion. From 1992 until 2016, Nintendo was also the majority shareholder of Major League Baseball's Seattle Mariners.  - The ZX Spectrum is an 8-bit personal home computer released in the United Kingdom in 1982 by Sinclair Research Ltd. It was manufactured in Dundee, Scotland, in the now closed Timex factory.  - Ocean Software Ltd (also known in the United States as Ocean of America, Inc.), commonly referred to as Ocean, was a British software development company, that became one of the biggest European video game developers/publishers of the 1980s and 1990s. It was acquired by a French holding company, Infogrames in 1996 and renamed to \\"Infogrames UK\\" in 1998, and again in 2004 to Atari UK, and once again in 2009 now known as Atari, Inc.  - A fighting game is a video game genre in which the player controls an on-screen character and engages in close combat with an opponent, which can be either an AI or controlled by another player. The fight matches typically consist of several rounds and take place in an arena, while each character has widely differing abilities but each is relatively viable to choose. Players must master techniques such as blocking, counter-attacking, and chaining attacks together into \\"combos\\". Since the early 1990s, most fighting games allow the player to execute special attacks by performing specific input combinations. The fighting game genre is related to but distinct from beat 'em ups, which involve large numbers of enemies against the human player.  - The Addams Family is the title of a video game released for the original Game Boy , as well as differing versions for the Amiga , Amstrad CPC , Atari ST , Commodore 64 , Game Gear , Genesis , NES , SNES , and the ZX Spectrum . The games are a tie - in with the 1991 movie , The Addams Family . It was published and developed in 1992 by Ocean Software . It is a platform side - scrolling action game .  - The Amiga is a family of personal computers sold by Commodore in the 1980s and 1990s. Based on the Motorola 68000 family of microprocessors, the machine has a custom chipset with graphics and sound capabilities that were unprecedented for the price, and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS. The Amiga provided a significant upgrade from earlier 8-bit home computers, including Commodore's own C64.  - A Platform game (or platformer) is a video game which involves guiding an avatar to jump between suspended platforms and/or over obstacles to advance the game. The player controls the jumps to avoid letting the avatar fall from platforms or miss necessary jumps. The most common unifying element of games of this genre is the jump button, but now there are other alternative like swiping in touchscreen. \\"Jumping\\", in this genre, may include swinging from extendable arms, as in \\"Ristar\\" or \\"Bionic Commando\\", or bouncing from springboards or trampolines, as in \\"Alpha Waves\\". These mechanics, even in the context of other genres, are commonly called \\"platforming\\", a verbification of \\"platform\\". Games where jumping is automated completely, such as 3D games in \\"The Legend of Zelda\\" series, fall outside of the genre.  - The Atari ST is a line of home computers from Atari Corporation and the successor to the Atari 8-bit family. The initial ST model, the 520ST, saw limited release in the spring of 1985 and was widely available in July. The Atari ST is the first personal computer to come with a bit-mapped color GUI, using a version of Digital Research's GEM released in February 1985. The 1040ST, released in 1986, is the first personal computer to ship with a megabyte of RAM in the base configuration and also the first with a cost-per-kilobyte of less than US1.  - The Commodore 64, also known as the C64, C-64, C= 64, or occasionally CBM 64 or VIC-64 in Sweden, is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International. It is listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time, with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units. Volume production started in early 1982, marketing in August for . Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET, the C64 took its name from its of RAM. It had superior sound and graphical specifications compared to other earlier systems such as the Apple II and Atari 800, with multi-color sprites and a more advanced sound processor.  - AmigaOS is the proprietary native operating system of the Amiga and AmigaOne personal computers. It was developed first by Commodore International and introduced with the launch of the first Amiga, the Amiga 1000, in 1985. Early versions of AmigaOS required the Motorola 68000 series of 16-bit and 32-bit microprocessors. Later versions were developed by Haage & Partner (AmigaOS 3.5 and 3.9) and then Hyperion Entertainment (AmigaOS 4.0-4.1). A PowerPC microprocessor is required for the most recent release, AmigaOS 4.  - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea.  - Satoru Okada (  \\"Okada Satoru\\") was the general manager of Nintendo Research & Engineering, the division designing and developing Nintendo handheld game consoles (such as the Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP, and Nintendo DS consoles). He is best known for creating the original Game Boy. He was also assistant producer and director of and contributor to several Nintendo games, notably \\"Metroid\\", released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1986.  - Digital Research, Inc. (also known as DR or DRI; originally Intergalactic Digital Research) was the company created by Dr. Gary Kildall to market and develop his CP/M operating system and related products.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Variety: Puns and Anagrams VARIETY PUZZLE — I’m happy to see Mark Diehl’s byline under Puns and Anagrams again. I think that Dr. Diehl (he’s a dentist in his day job) has a real knack for this sort of puzzle, and his clues are a bit more challenging than that of other constructors, but that’s a good thing. It brings them a small step closer to the cryptics that some PandA solvers aspire to conquer. Not only that but Dr. Diehl’s PandA grids are Scrabbly and filled with fun entries. Would you have thought to clue J.K. ROWLING as “Author whose first two initials fit between I-L wrong”? Isn’t it cool that Dr. Diehl saw that it could work out? If you’re still pondering how RELAXANTS could be the answer to “They’ll help you unwind at 10 Star Lane,” think Roman numerals. “10 Star Lane,” substituting an X for the 10, anagrams to RELAXANTS. I love that, as well as the somewhat delayed “Aha!” moment that I experienced. In fact, if you’re into Roman numerals, you’ll enjoy 25 Across’s clue, “5 + 0 + 1 + 500,” the answer is not 506, it’s VOID. V = 5, O = 0, I = 1, and 500 = D. Note to beginning solvers: If you have always wished that you could solve cryptic crosswords or, as the rest of the world calls them, “crosswords,” Puns and Anagrams puzzles are a great place to start. There are only two types of clues, puns and — wait for it — anagrams. You’ll need to know how to recognize which type of clue is which, and how to parse the seemingly opaque clues. I’ve written more about it here in case you need help. Give Puns and Anagrams a try; I think you’ll find them to be a breath of fresh air after a week of crossword puzzles.","output":"This article discusses Mark Diehl's Puns and Anagrams puzzles, praised for their challenging and unique clues, which are considered a small step closer to cryptic crosswords.

Rather than explicitly presenting the nomenclature of Nasser's Arab admirers, the sentence emphasizes the considerable reach and impact of the 'Voice of the Arabs' radio station, based in Cairo, which broadcasted Nasser's ideas of united Arab action throughout the Arabic-speaking world. Nasser, a proponent of Pan-Arabism, used the radio as a powerful medium to foster a sense of unity and shared identity among Arab nations. The explicit mention of historian Eugene Rogan's quotation, \\"Nasser conquered the Arab world by radio,\\" underscores Nasser's widespread influence and the significant role of the radio in amplifying his vision and ideas. However, the name or term by which Nasser's Arab admirers identified themselves or were known by others is not specified or inferred in the provided sentence. To answer that question, one would need to conduct further research into the sociopolitical landscape of the time, particularly with a focus on the followers of Nasser and their ideological leanings. The admirers of Nasser's ideology were often called Nasserists or supporters of Nasserism, a political ideology based on the policies of Gamal Abdel Nasser, but this information is not given in the original sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sara grew the flowers in the greenhouse instead of the backyard because it was warmer in the","output":"greenhouse.  Step 1: Identify the main elements in your segment of the story. In this case, Sara, the greenhouse, and the aspect of warmth are the main threads being considered.  Step 2: Consider how these elements will interact. Given that we understand the greenhouse is connected to warmth and the growing of flowers, a sensible direction for the story would be to focus on Sara's experience within the greenhouse, possibly emphasizing the blooming of the flowers. So, to continue the story: \\"Although the backyard was vast, Sara preferred the cozy hug of the greenhouse. It wrapped her and her sprouts in an inviting warmth, even during the coldest of winters. The idea of their shared isolation from the outside world was oddly comforting to her. As days turned into weeks, Sara lovingly tended to her floral companions, nurturing each one like her own child.  The flowers responded to her love and the greenhouse’s warmth in the best way they could: by blooming. Each blossom was a testament to Sara's hard work and dedication, from the bulbs of tulips that sprung up to the sunlight to the delicate petals of rose slowly unfurling. It wasn't long before the greenhouse became a tropical paradise within the chilly confines of her backyard. Being inside the greenhouse felt like crossing into another dimension. The hum of the outside world would become distant, exchanged for the softer symphony of nature - the rustle of leaves, the light patter of water droplets falling from the mister, the ever-so-subtle scent of fresh earth and blooming flowers. It was her sanctuary, her fortress, fortified with glass panes and vibrant petals. Here, regardless of the frost outside, warmth held eternal reign. Sara's heart swelled with contentment whenever she stepped into her floral abyss, a wave of satisfaction washing over her, her love for her flowers outshining the sun they grew under. And it was this love and patience, combined with the unique warmth the greenhouse provided, that made the flowers bloom like they did nowhere else.\\" Justification: The story continuation reflects on the main elements brought up early in the story. The focus on the flowers blooming as a result of Sara's efforts and the warmth of the greenhouse adds depth to her character while retaining the key essence of the story."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is She agreed to visit the gardens of the Royal Horticultural Society at Kensington and take a drive through London in an open carriage. a good answer to this question?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"She agreed to visit the gardens of the Royal Horticultural Society at Kensington and take a drive through London in an open carriage\\" is a good answer to the question about where Queen Victoria visited after being advised by her uncle, King Leopold, to make more public appearances. However, it could be expanded upon to provide a more detailed and complete response. Here is a longer, more detailed version of the answer: In the early 1840s, Queen Victoria received advice from her uncle, King Leopold of Belgium, to make more public appearances in order to connect with her subjects and raise her public profile. Although Queen Victoria was initially reluctant to do so due to her reserved nature and the stressful demands of court life, she eventually heeded her uncle's advice and agreed to participate in several public events and outings. One of the most notable public appearances Queen Victoria made during this time was her visit to the gardens of the Royal Horticultural Society at Kensington in London. The Royal Horticultural Society is a prestigious British organization dedicated to promoting horticulture and gardening, and at the time, their gardens were an important venue for both social functions and scientific research. Queen Victoria's visit to the gardens helped to raise awareness and appreciation of the work being done by the society, as well as demonstrate her support for British horticulture and botanical studies. In addition to her visit to the Royal Horticultural Society, Queen Victoria also undertook a drive through the city of London in an open carriage. This allowed her to be seen by a large number of her subjects who lined the streets to catch a glimpse of their Queen, and it served as an important symbol of her dedication to her people. Open carriage rides were a customary way for members of the royal family to appear in public during the nineteenth century, and Queen Victoria's participation in this tradition helped to strengthen her presence in the public sphere and enhance her connection with her subjects. As a result of these efforts, Queen Victoria's public image and popularity significantly improved. She continued to participate in public events and ceremonies throughout her long reign, and the success of her early public appearances laid the foundation for the role of the British monarch as a public figurehead concerned with the welfare and progress of her people."},{"instruction":"Question: After getting high his memory seemed shot, he felt practically what?

And once again, high blood pressure is making headlines in the news: the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) have just released new guidelines about hypertension. Since this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I’m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family. By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event. (The benefit was even smaller in adults aged 50-75.) According to the above context, answer the following question. What is most likely the author's occupation?

Can you tell me the answer to when was the federal law providing benefits for the unemployed passed??","output":"The federal law providing benefits for the unemployed in the United States was initially passed on August 14, 1935, as a part of the Social Security Act. This landmark legislation, signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, aimed to address social and economic problems faced by the nation during the Great Depression.  Title III of the Social Security Act established a cooperative federal-state system for unemployment compensation, which was designed to provide financial assistance to eligible workers who found themselves out of work through no fault of their own. The unemployment insurance program laid out in the Act is a joint effort between the federal government and individual state governments to administer the program and disburse benefits to those in need. Under the terms of the Act, employers would pay a payroll tax, and the unemployment insurance benefits would be funded through these collected taxes. The federal government is responsible for overseeing the program and setting general guidelines, while individual states are responsible for the actual administration of the program, determining eligibility criteria, and setting benefit amounts and duration. This cooperative system ensures that each state can tailor its unemployment insurance system to the specific needs of its workforce while maintaining uniform standards. Since its inception in 1935, the unemployment insurance program has undergone several amendments and expansions to address the evolving needs of the American workforce. The most notable changes include the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (1939), which set uniform guidelines for the taxation of employers, the Employment Security Amendments (1970), which established temporary extensions of benefits during periods of high unemployment, and the Federal-State Extended Benefits Program (1970), which provides additional benefits to those who exhaust their regular benefits during periods of high unemployment across the nation or in specific states. Today, the unemployment insurance system remains a critical safety net for millions of Americans experiencing job loss due to economic downturns, natural disasters, or other disruptions to the labor market. It is important to note, though, that the system continuously adapts and evolves to respond to the changing economic and social landscape in the United States."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

That same evening, a group of Israeli Mossad counter-terrorist commandos under the command of Major David Kabakov, arrives in Beirut from an Israeli spy ship and travel to raid the safe house. They kill most of the Black September operatives, but Kabakov backs down from shooting Dahlia when he finds her in a bathroom shower, mistakenly thinking that she might be an innocent call-girl. The Israelis take many files as well as an audio tape that Dahlia just made accepting responsibility for an upcoming attack in America at the start of the next year. Kabakov and the commandos set explosive charges around the house and detonate them before retreating back to their ship.

In Bridger's Wells, Nevada in 1885, Art Croft and Gil Carter ride into town and enter Darby's Saloon. The atmosphere is subdued due to recent incidents of cattle-rustling. Art and Gil are suspected to be rustlers because they have rarely been seen in town. A man enters the saloon and announces that a rancher named Larry Kinkaid has been murdered. The townspeople immediately form a posse to pursue the murderers, who they believe are cattle rustlers. A judge tells the posse that it must bring the suspects back for trial, and that its formation by a deputy (the sheriff being out of town) is illegal. Art and Gil join the posse to avoid raising even more suspicion. Davies, who was initially opposed to forming the posse, also joins, along with \\"Major\\" Tetley and his son Gerald. Poncho informs the posse that three men and cattle bearing Kinkaid's brand have just entered Bridger's Pass. The posse encounters a stagecoach. When they try to stop it, the stagecoach guard assumes that it is a stickup, and shoots, wounding Art. In the coach are Rose Mapen, Gil's ex-girlfriend, and her new husband, Swanson. Later that night in Ox-Bow Canyon, the posse finds three men sleeping, with what are presumed to be stolen cattle nearby. The posse interrogates them: a young, well-spoken man, Donald Martin; a Mexican, Juan Martínez; and an old man, Alva Hardwicke (Francis Ford, brother of film director John Ford). Martin claims that he purchased the cattle from Kinkaid but received no bill of sale. No one believes Martin, and the posse decides to hang the three men at sunrise. Martin writes a letter to his wife and asks Davies, the only member of the posse that he trusts, to deliver it. Davies reads the letter, and, hoping to save Martin's life, shows it to the others.

Summarize this article: Using a shovel or hiring someone with a backhoe, remove the top layers of grass and dirt from the marked-off driveway area.  You might want to use a tiller to loosen up the soil and make it easier to dig out. The amount of soil you remove depends on how many layers of soil you are planning.  You should dig 4-6 inches of soil for every layer of rocks you plan to put down. This doesn’t have to be perfect since it will be covered by rocks, but your driveway surface should be pretty level—any areas that are deeper than other areas may lead to water pooling and cause mud puddles that have to be filled in with more gravel later. Use a mechanical compactor, have someone drive over the area with a bulldozer, or drive over the area repeatedly with a heavy vehicle such as a large truck. If you want to prevent grass and weeds from growing through your driveway, you may want to lay a weed barrier underneath your rocks.  Weed barrier is a woven landscaping cloth that allows water to pass through it but does not allow weeds to grow through it, and it is available at most landscaping and home improvement stores. Weed barrier usually comes on a roll.  You should be able to lay the roll down at one end of your driveway and unroll it until you have reached the other end of your driveway. Most weed barrier rolls are 4 feet wide, so you may need to get several rolls.  Be sure the amount of weed barrier you buy matches or exceeds the square footage (length times width) of your driveway. If you are using landscaping timber or bricks to edge your driveway, you may want to place them before the gravel is delivered so that they can hold the rocks in place.  If you do not want a border, you can skip this step.","output":"The given article outlines the process of preparing a driveway area before laying down rocks. It begins by suggesting that the initial step is to remove the top layers of grass and dirt from the marked-off driveway area, either manually using a shovel or by hiring someone with a backhoe.

Depending on the number of rock layers planned, the depth of soil removal should be around 4-6 inches for each layer.

Question: Connecting with Patients Dr. Paris often treats several generations of a family over many years. \\"He's seen us through two births, one operation, multiple earaches, a broken wrist and a recovery from a serious traffic crash,\\" says Jill Farrow, a 43-year-old lawyer whose first visit to Dr. Paris was as a teenager. During the birth of her younger son, Farrow began bleeding badly. Dr. Paris managed to solve the problem in a delicate procedure. \\"Twenty years ago, she probably would have died,\\" he says. Today, when he performs school sports physical examinations for the Farrow boys, 10 and 11, he is always reminded that lives are changed forever by doctors just doing their jobs. To be a mix of country doc and somewhat adventurer, the 55-year-old family physician moved to Hailey after completing his residency . He hoped to practice medicine there and ski at nearby Sun Valley. Unfortunately, the only job opening was for an emergency-room doctor in Missoula, Montana, 300 miles away. Dr. Paris took it. \\"I'd ski all day and then drive all night to be in Missoula for a 48-hour shift,\\" he recalls. \\"I'm lucky to be alive.\\" Knowing he couldn't keep up with his eight-hour commute , he began taking flying lessons. In 1981, Dr. Paris joined a small medical practice in Hailey, a former mining town with a population at the time of 2,109. As Hailey grew in the shadow of Sun Valley's booming popularity, Dr. Paris's own practice expanded to seven physicians, including his wife, Kathryn Woods, who is also a family doctor. They met in 1986 at a certification exam in Denver when, in a room full of men in stodgy suits, Woods arrived wearing a Lycra biking outfit and carrying the front wheel of her bicycle (which she couldn't lock up outside). Dr. Paris asked her out on the spot. In 1989, they married. Dr. Paris often reminds himself that   _  . A) lives of people should not always stay the same B) people can rely on themselves to change their life C) doctors should change their own life D) it is the duty of a doctor to heal the patients Answer:","output":"Dr. Paris often reminds himself that it is the duty of a doctor to heal the patients (D). His experiences treating multiple generations of families, such as the Farrows, have shown him the profound impact that doctors can have on their patients' lives. Whether it's saving a mother's life during childbirth or simply providing routine medical care for her children, Dr. Paris understands that the work he and his fellow physicians do can change lives forever. Throughout his career, Dr. Paris has managed to strike a balance between being a dedicated country doctor and enjoying his own personal adventures. He moved to Hailey for its proximity to Sun Valley's skiing opportunities but eventually found work as an emergency-room doctor in Missoula, Montana. The demanding commute drove him to learn to fly, which ultimately allowed him to settle in Hailey and grow a thriving medical practice. As Hailey's population grew, so did Dr. Paris's practice, eventually attracting seven physicians, including his wife, Dr. Kathryn Woods. Their partnership further exemplifies their shared passion for medicine and their commitment to serving their community. Together, they continue to make a difference in the lives of their patients, one interaction at a time. In remembering that it is the duty of a doctor to heal the patients, Dr. Paris remains focused on his critical role in the lives of those who entrust him with their health.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Background: John William Money (8 July 1921 - 7 July 2006) was a psychologist, sexologist and author, specializing in research into sexual identity and biology of gender. He was one of the first scientists to study the psychology of sexual fluidity and how the societal constructs of \\"gender\\" affect an individual. More recent academic studies have criticized Money's work in many respects, particularly in regards to his involvement with the sex-reassignment of David Reimer and his eventual suicide. Money's writing has been translated into many languages, and includes around 2,000 articles, books, chapters and reviews. Context: Born in Morrinsville, New Zealand, to a family of English and Welsh descent, Money initially studied psychology at Victoria University of Wellington, graduating with a double master's degree in psychology and education in 1944. Money was a junior member of the psychology faculty at the University of Otago in Dunedin, but in 1947, at the age of 26, he emigrated to the United States to study at the Psychiatric Institute of the University of Pittsburgh. He left Pittsburgh and earned his PhD from Harvard University in 1952. He was married briefly in the 1950s but had no children.  Money proposed and developed several theories and related terminology, including gender identity, gender role, gender-identity/role, and lovemap. He coined the term paraphilia (appearing in the DSM-III) to replace perversions and introduced the term sexual orientation in place of sexual preference, arguing that attraction is not necessarily a matter of free choice. Money was a professor of pediatrics and medical psychology at Johns Hopkins University from 1951 until his death. He also established the Johns Hopkins Gender Identity Clinic in 1965 along with Claude Migeon who was the head of plastic surgery at Johns Hopkins. The hospital began performing sexual reassignment surgery in 1966. At Johns Hopkins, Money was also involved with the Sexual Behaviors Unit, which ran studies on sex-reassignment surgery. He received the Magnus Hirschfeld Medal in 2002 from the German Society for Social-Scientific Sexuality Research.  Money was an early supporter of New Zealand's arts, both literary and visual. He was a noted friend and supporter of author Janet Frame. In 2002, as his Parkinson's disease worsened, Money donated a substantial portion of his art collection to the Eastern Southland Art Gallery in Gore, New Zealand. In 2003, the New Zealand Prime Minister, Helen Clark, opened the John Money wing at the Eastern Southland Gallery.  Money died 7 July 2006, one day before his 85th birthday, in Towson, Maryland, of complications from Parkinson's disease. Question: was he well regarded in his field? Answer:","output":"John William Money was initially well-regarded in his field of psychology, sexology, and research into sexual identity and biology of gender. He was a pioneer in the study of the psychology of sexual fluidity and the societal constructs of \\"gender,\\" which has greatly influenced the understanding of these subjects today. Money's development of several theories and related terminology, such as gender identity, gender role, and lovemap, have become fundamental concepts within the field of sexology and gender studies. Moreover, Money's work in establishing the Johns Hopkins Gender Identity Clinic and being involved in the Sexual Behaviors Unit demonstrated his commitment to advancing the field. His contributions earned him significant recognition, such as the Magnus Hirschfeld Medal in 2002, which was awarded by the German Society for Social-Scientific Sexuality Research. However, Money's reputation and legacy have been tarnished over time based on the criticism of specific aspects of his work, most notably his involvement with the sex-reassignment of David Reimer. This case brought significant controversy due to Reimer's eventual suicide and the ethical concerns raised by Money's experimental treatment methods. As a result of this and other criticisms, Money's standing within the scientific community has become more complex and debated. In conclusion, John William Money was initially well-regarded in his field, with his groundbreaking work and theories influencing the study of sexology and gender. However, due to controversies and subsequent criticisms, his reputation has become increasingly nuanced, and certain aspects of his work have faced scrutiny from the academic community."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: Information:  - Lead, from the Old English \\"léad\\", is a chemical element with atomic number 82 and symbol Pb (after the Latin, \\"plumbum\\"). It has the second highest atomic number of all practically stable elements. As such, lead is located at the end of some decay chains of heavier elements, which in part accounts for its relative abundance: its stability exceeds those of other similarly-numbered elements. Lead is a soft, malleable, and heavy metal. Freshly cut lead has a bluish-white color that soon tarnishes to a dull grayish color when exposed to air; as a liquid, it has a shiny chrome-silver luster. Lead's density of 11.34 g/cm exceeds those of most common materials.   - Text figures (also known as non-lining, lowercase, old style, ranging, hanging, medieval, billing, or antique figures or numerals) are numerals typeset with varying heights in a fashion that resembles a typical line of running text, hence the name. They are contrasted with lining figures (also called titling or modern figures), which are the same height as upper-case letters.  - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.  - In typography, leading refers to the distance between the baselines of successive lines of type. The term originated in the days of hand-typesetting, when thin strips of lead were inserted into the forms to increase the vertical distance between lines of type. The term is still used in modern page layout software such as QuarkXPress and Adobe InDesign.  - In typography, a typeface (also known as font family) is a set of one or more fonts each composed of glyphs that share common design features. Each font of a typeface has a specific weight, style, condensation, width, slant, italicization, ornamentation, and designer or foundry (and formerly size, in metal fonts). For example, \\"ITC Garamond Bold Condensed Italic\\" means the bold, condensed-width, italic version of ITC Garamond. It is a different font from \\"ITC Garamond Condensed Italic\\" and \\"ITC Garamond Bold Condensed,\\" but all are fonts within the same typeface, \\"ITC Garamond.\\" ITC Garamond is a different typeface from \\"Adobe Garamond\\" or \\"Monotype Garamond.\\" (These are all alternative updates or digitisations of the typeface Garamond, originally created in the 16th century.) There are thousands of different typefaces in existence, with new ones being developed constantly.  - X (named \\"ex\\" , plural \\"exes\\") is the 24th and antepenultimate letter in the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet.  - In typography, line length is the width of a block of typeset text, usually measured in units of length like inches or points or in characters per line. A block of text or paragraph has a maximum line length that fits a determined design.  - Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed. The arrangement of type involves selecting typefaces, point sizes, line lengths, line-spacing (leading), and letter-spacing (tracking), and adjusting the space between pairs of letters (kerning). The term typography is also applied to the style, arrangement, and appearance of the letters, numbers, and symbols created by the process. Type design is a closely related craft, sometimes considered part of typography; most typographers do not design typefaces, and some type designers do not consider themselves typographers. Typography also may be used as a decorative device, unrelated to communication of information.  - A written language is the representation of a spoken or gestural language by means of a writing system. Written language is an invention in that it must be taught to children, who will pick up spoken language (oral or sign) by exposure even if they are not specifically taught.  - In typography, kerning is the process of adjusting the spacing between characters in a proportional font, usually to achieve a visually pleasing result. Kerning adjusts the space between individual letter forms, while tracking (letter-spacing) adjusts spacing uniformly over a range of characters. In a well-kerned font, the two-dimensional blank spaces between each pair of characters all have a visually similar area.  - In typography , small capitals ( usually abbreviated small caps ) are uppercase ( capital ) characters set at the same height and weight as surrounding lowercase ( small ) letters or text figures . They are used in running text to prevent capitalized words from appearing too large on the page , and as a method of emphasis or distinctiveness for text alongside or instead of italics , or when boldface is inappropriate . For example , the all - caps TEXT IN CAPS appears as text in caps in small caps . They can be used to draw attention to the opening phrase or line of a new section of text , or to provide an additional style in a dictionary entry where many parts must be typographically differentiated . Well - designed small capitals are not simply scaled - down versions of normal capitals ; they normally retain the same stroke weight as other letters and have a wider aspect ratio for readability . Typically , the height of a small capital will be one ex , the same height as most lowercase characters in the font . In Anglo - Saxon typography , small caps are somewhat larger than the x-height . For example , in some Tiro Typeworks fonts , small caps are 30 % larger than x-height , and 70 % the height of full capitals . To differentiate between these two alternatives , the x-height form is sometimes called petite caps , preserving the name \`\` small caps '' for the larger variant . OpenType fonts can define both forms via the \`\` small caps '' and the \`\` petite caps '' features . Because the support for the petite caps feature is absent from most desktop - publishing programs , many fonts use x-height small caps in the small - caps feature . Many word processors and text - formatting systems include an option to format text in caps and small caps , which leaves uppercase letters as they are , but converts lowercase letters to small caps . How this is implemented depends on the typesetting system ; some can use true small caps associated with modern professional fonts , making text such as \`\` Latvia joined Nato on...  - Type design is the art and process of designing typeface.  - The ISO basic Latin alphabet is a Latin-script alphabet and consists of two sets of 26 letters, codified in various national and international standards and used widely in international communication.  - In typography, letter-spacing, usually called tracking by typographers, refers to a consistent degree of increase (or sometimes decrease) of space between letters to affect density in a line or block of text.

Having seen 'In His Life: The John Lennon Story', I was quite concerned that Two Of Us will turn out no better. The fact that Aidan Quinn and Jared Harris look absolutely nothing like John Lennon and Paul McCartney  even with some make-up and proper hairdos  didn't help one bit. But I was more than a bit pleasantly surprised. It's probably thanks to the involvement of Michael Lindsay-Hogg, who directed Let It Be in 1970 and consequently probably knew John and Paul quite well, that the characters and the dialogue came across as convincing as they did. (The writing credit for Two Of Us is given to a man named Mark Stanfield, of whom I know absolutely nothing; I feel confident that director Lindsay-Hogg had more than a bit to do with the script.) Two Of Us is not a biography of the Beatles; it has very little plot, in fact, and takes place all in one day in New York City. What it does is imagine a meeting between John and Paul in 1976, while John lived in New York. That meeting is entirely fictitious, of course  though it can't truly be disproved that such a meeting actually took place. But through that imagined conversation it gives us a glimpse into the personalities of these two great musicians  their intelligence, their sense of humor, their different reaction to stardom, and most of all their relationship; what made them such a great team, and what broke them up. Since it's a talk movie, nothing much except for dialogue between two characters for an hour and a half, it's likely to bore all but true fans of the Beatles; but it's a fantastic piece of writing and storytelling, and is both informative and touching. For those interested in these two musical giants, very quickly you'll get over the shock of how different the actors look from their counterparts and feel like John and Paul had come to life  so intimate and convincing is the script, and so committed are the actors. Two Of Us gives you priceless insight into the lives of two geniuses, and a tale that is both sad and funny. Most certainly recommended.

Original Sentence: He was sent to Rangoon, Burma (today Yangon, Myanmar) and taught in Thailand for further study. This sentence implies that the individual was sent to Rangoon, Burma (today Yangon, Myanmar) for an unspecified reason. The purpose of being in Rangoon is not immediately clear. Furthermore, the sentence indicates that while in Thailand, the individual taught others (presumably as a part of furthering their studies). Rephrased Sentence: He was sent to Rangoon, Burma (now Yangon, Myanmar), for further study and then taught in Thailand. The rephrased sentence provides clearer information about the purpose of the individual's stay in Rangoon, Burma (now Yangon, Myanmar)—to pursue further study. The chronological sequencing of events is also more explicit in this sentence, as the individual studied in Rangoon first and then moved on to teach in Thailand.

The sun had just begun to set in the distance, casting a warm glow over the desolate landscape around them. They had been stranded in the wilderness for days now, with no sign of rescue. Joe was an experienced outdoorsman who had always enjoyed challenging himself in nature, and this time, he had brought along his best friend, Danny. Despite being blind, Danny was always eager to take on new adventures and challenges with Joe. He had an indomitable spirit and a sense of humor that made every journey more enjoyable for the both of them. However, they didn't expect to be in this perilous situation - lost and with limited supplies. As they continued sharing the ration bar, Joe thought about their dire circumstances. They were both hungry, thirsty, and exhausted from days of navigating through rough terrain. Joe, who was responsible for leading Danny, felt a heavy burden on his shoulders. He was not only responsible for his life but also for his friend's well-being. Despite his concern for Danny, Joe couldn't help but admire his blind friend's resilience. Danny never complained about their situation or allowed his disability to hold him back. Instead, he had a knack for lifting their spirits with a well-timed joke, or providing a listening ear when Joe needed to vent his frustration. As night approached, the temperature dropped, and the friends huddled together for warmth. Joe started a small fire to ward off the chilling air and to keep wild animals at bay. They spent the evening recounting their fondest memories, stories of past adventures, and dreams for the future. Their bond only deepened in the face of adversity. The next morning, in the pale light of dawn, Joe crafted a makeshift walking stick for Danny, helping him to navigate the rough terrain more easily. With renewed hope, they set off in search of help or a way out of the wilderness. Throughout the day, the friends worked as a team. Joe focused on deciphering the landscape, while Danny strained to use his heightened senses of hearing and touch to search for signs of civilization or nearby water sources. Together, they devised creative solutions for the numerous obstacles they encountered, such as crossing treacherous streams or setting traps to catch some food. That night, they managed to catch a small rabbit, and Joe cooked it over their fire. The meal, though meager, brought them both strength and comfort, as they held onto hope that their situation would improve soon. On the following day, as they trekked further into the unknown, Danny noticed a faint sound in the distance. With his extraordinary sense of hearing, he was able to guide Joe towards what he believed to be the sound of human civilization. Their hearts raced as they got closer. Finally, after hours of walking towards the sound, they stumbled upon a small village on the outskirts of the wilderness. The villagers greeted the exhausted friends with open arms, providing them with food, shelter, and the necessary resources for contacting a rescue team. Once they were safely back home, Joe and Danny's friendship had become stronger than ever. Their harrowing experience taught them about resilience, hope, and the power of perseverance. The bond they shared would continue to flourish throughout their remaining years, as they continued to embark on countless adventures and face adversities together. After all, true friendship is like an unbreakable rope – pulling each other through the darkest of times and the toughest of challenges."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The pollination process requires a carrier for the pollen, which can be animal, wind, or human intervention (by hand-pollination or by using a pollen sprayer). Cross pollination produces seeds with a different genetic makeup from the parent plants; such seeds may be created deliberately as part of a selective breeding program for fruit trees with desired attributes. Trees that are cross-pollinated or pollinated via an insect pollinator produce more fruit than trees with flowers that just self-pollinate. In fruit trees, bees are an essential part of the pollination process for the formation of fruit. Possible answers:  1). no;  2). yes;","output":"Based on the text provided, it is true that bees are needed to pollinate fruit trees. The text states that, \\"In fruit trees, bees are an essential part of the pollination process for the formation of fruit.\\" Although there are other possible pollinators, such as the wind or humans, bees play a crucial role in enabling the cross-pollination of flowers. This is because the pollination process requires a carrier for the pollen to transfer from one flower to another for the fertilization of the flowers. Cross pollination, as mentioned in the text, leads to the production of seeds with a different genetic makeup from their parent plants. This genetic diversity is beneficial for the plants, allowing them to adapt better to various environmental conditions and resist pests and diseases. This process may also be used deliberately in selective breeding programs for fruit trees with desired attributes. Furthermore, the text highlights that cross-pollinated trees or trees pollinated via an insect pollinator, such as bees, tend to produce more fruit compared to self-pollinating trees. Bees are efficient pollinators as they visit multiple flowers during their foraging process, allowing for a higher rate of successful cross-pollination. In summary, bees play an essential role in pollinating fruit trees, as they contribute to successful cross-pollination and the formation of fruit. Thus, based on the information given in the text, the answer related to the necessity of bees for the pollination of fruit trees is 2). Yes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mary always got good deals when she was grocery shopping but Natalie did not because","output":"Natalie simply didn't have the same level of experience or patience as Mary. Mary had been a thrifty shopper for years, always seeking out the best bargains and using her knowledge of sales cycles, coupons, and store policies to her advantage. Natalie, on the other hand, was new to managing her own grocery budget and just didn't have the same set of skills yet. One day, Natalie decided to tag along with Mary on her weekly grocery shopping trip, hoping to learn some of her secrets. As they entered the store, Mary immediately went to the area near the entrance where the weekly sale flyers were located. “First thing's first,” Mary said to Natalie, “Always grab the weekly flyer and take a look at what's on sale. This is where you'll find the best deals and plan your purchases and meals around them.” Natalie took a flyer and began flipping through the pages, noting the special offers on meats, produce, and other essential items. Meanwhile, Mary pulled out a small notebook from her purse, filled with neatly written lists and additional coupons she had found in various places. “My next tip is to use coupons whenever possible, but only if they are for items that you actually use or need. Otherwise, you end up spending more money rather than saving it.” Natalie nodded, realizing she had made that mistake before. As they walked through the store aisles, Mary continued to explain her shopping strategies to Natalie. “Another thing I do is keep track of the regular prices of items I often buy. That way, I know if the ‘sale price’ shown is actually a good deal or not.” Natalie glanced at the products on the shelves, comparing their current prices with the ones listed in the flyer she was holding. She started to recognize some of the marketing tricks that she had fallen for in the past. When they reached the produce section, Mary paused to inspect some fruits. “Some things, like fruit and vegetables, don't usually have coupons. So for these items, I try to buy them when they're in season, which means they're fresher and usually on sale.” She picked up a container of strawberries and checked the price against her notes. “These are actually a great price right now, so I'll grab a couple.” As the shopping trip continued, Natalie began to understand the secret to Mary's thrifty shopping habits: being organized, patient, and having a willingness to plan ahead. Natalie had always been more of an impulsive shopper, buying whatever caught her eye instead of making a conscious decision based on the best deals. But now, she was committed to change. By the end of the day, Natalie had not only learned a number of valuable money-saving tips, but she had helped them both cart away a hefty amount of groceries, all while staying comfortably within their budgets. As they loaded their haul into the car, she turned to Mary, a grin spreading across her face. “Thanks so much for showing me how you do this, Mary. I think I'll be a much smarter shopper from now on.” Mary smiled and patted her on the back. “No problem, Natalie. Just remember: it's a skill that takes time and practice. But soon enough, you'll be getting good deals just like me.” Natalie nodded in determination. In addition to saving money, she was excited about the new sense of control and confidence she felt in managing her own finances. As the pair drove home, they were already talking about their next shopping trip and the great deals that awaited them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: Cyborg Movie plot: A plague known as the living death cripples civilization. A small group of surviving scientists and doctors â located in Atlanta, Georgia, home of the CDC â work on a cure to save what remains of humanity. To complete their work they need information stored on a computer system in New York City. Pearl Prophet volunteers for the dangerous courier mission and is made into a cyborg through surgical augmentation. Pearl, accompanied by bodyguard Marshall Strat, retrieves the data in New York but is pursued by the vicious Fender Tremolo and his gang of pirates. Fender wants the cure so he can have a monopoly on its production. Strat, badly injured while fighting the pirates, tells Pearl to leave him and find a mercenary, known as a \\"slinger\\", who can escort her to safety. She gets cornered but is saved by a slinger named Gibson Rickenbacker. After she explains her situation, they are overrun by Fender's gang, and Gibson is knocked out by falling debris. Fender demands that she accompany him to Atlanta or die. Fender's gang slaughters a family and steals their boat. They head south for Atlanta via the Intracoastal Waterway with the captive Pearl. Gibson, who had been tracking the pirates, arrives at the scene of slaughter later that night. A shadowy figure attacks him, but he disables her. She turns out to be Nady Simmons, a young woman who mistook him as a pirate. Nady, whose family was wiped out by the plague, joins Gibson. Gibson is less concerned with a cure for the plague than with killing Fender. Gibson and Nady trek southward through the wastelands, where bandits ambush them. Concerned for Nady, Gibson unsuccessfully attempts to convince her to stay away. After declining sex with Nady, Gibson reveals that all he cares about is revenge against Fender, who killed his lover and destroyed his chance to have a normal life and family. Intercepting Fender and his crew near Charleston, South Carolina, Gibson defeats most of his men, but Fender shoots him with an air rifle. Now nursing a gunshot wound, Gibson... My question: What did Fender's gang steal from the family that they killed? Answer:","output":"Fender's gang stole the family's boat after they slaughtered them.

For parties, whether themed or no theme, run of mill decorations like balloons, confetti, streamers, and banners are not uncommon.  Go to stores like Dollar Tree and find these common decorations at a low cost. Go to higher end stores, like Michael's, to find decorations that match with your theme. Make your decorations unique and inject a little personality by going the decor road less traveled or visiting a local thrift store for decor.  Use pink paper lanterns as a unique, luxe alternative to the average balloon, for example. Use mason jars as center pieces and thrift plates and table cloths to make for an elegant setup for your party and/or personalize them to match your party's overall theme. Party favors do not have to be complex in nature. They can be straightforward favors in their simplicity. They can also be sentimental and come with a lot of thought and effort. While you don't have to have party favors, they are a nice way to leave a lasting impression after a great night.  Fill up a small gift bag with different lollipops and candies. Use a small box to box an individual cupcake. Extra points if the cupcake is the same icing and flavor as the main birthday cake! Gift guests with a notebook and a pen that you can personalize by writing their names on the front of. Make friendship bracelets out of multicolored strings to give as party favors. Create a \\"mixtape\\" out of blank CDs and your favorite songs from the previous year. This will be a great reminder of you and a memento of what you guys were probably listening to when you were a year younger. Cater to the needs of any food allergies that might have been mentioned in your invite's RSVP. Kids aren't hard to please when it comes to food so try to keep it as simple as possible, bearing in mind that in terms of importance, food is the icing while the birthday party is the actual cake.  Order party food staples like pizza, potato chips or pretzels, and sodas. Make sure to order a cake, as well as ice cream options. Provide healthy alternatives like vegetable or hummus trays. Simple is good, but options are also good. Consider adding gluten-free foods to the menu as well. Keeping your guests entertained should be the host/hostess's main objective. While choosing to host a birthday party outside of your home may make that task a lot easier, hosting a birthday party from home will mean coming up with ideas of how to keep your guests from getting bored:  Consider group games everyone can play like  Heads Up,  Twister,  Would You Rather, karaoke, and board games .

This beautifully animated film   is a first class production in every way, and features the familiar voices of Kristin Chenoweth, Anjelica Huston, Jane Horrocks, Lucy Liu, and Raven Symone. The movie offers up an adventure that's easy enough to follow, but complex enough to hold one's attention, and even throws in a nice little moral about friendship. What can I say? I'm pleasantly surprised.                                    The up-and-coming Mae Whitman voices Tinker Bell herself, a far more dynamic character than we met in Peter Pan. Though Tinker still possesses her fiery temper, it doesn't manifest itself immediately, and takes a backseat to this pixie's many good qualities. As it turns out, Tinker Bell is extremely skilled at tinkering , so she is a natural choice to build a special scepter , for Pixie Hollow's Autumn Celebration.

Haiti is in size and has an estimated 10.6 million people, making it the most populous country in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the second-most populous country in the Caribbean as a whole.  - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state.  - The Dominican Republic is a sovereign state occupying the eastern two-thirds of the island of Hispaniola, in the Greater Antilles archipelago in the Caribbean region.

My other daughter wanted to move out as soon as she hit 21 but her dad and I gave her some rules or rather instructions she had to follow before she can pack her bags and move in with the boyfriend. 1st she had to show us that she had 3months rent saved up in her savings account. Not just her half of the rent but the whole rent. Which was about 3,600 dollars. You never know if something happens to her or she looses her part time job she can still pay her rent. Nobody wants an eviction on their record. 2nd since she was still going to school and we were paying for it we wanted to see proof every semester that she was enrolled. Education is a big deal to me. 3rd she had to get on BIRTH CONTROL. I don't want any ooops sorry Mom I am pregnant. Now I can't finish school because I have to work full time to pay for my baby.. I was a teen Mom and I didn't get to go to college so it is 100% important that my kids go and finish. She complied with all or requests and is doing remarkable. She has been out on her own for almost 2years .

The mother in this scenario sets clear and strict guidelines for her daughter to follow. This includes having saved money for rent, proving continuous school enrollment, and ensuring the use of birth control.

However, it's important to note that the term \\"controlling\\" is used here in the context of the given options. This does not necessarily imply negative connotations — it might be a controlling style of parenting, yet it's towards the goal of ensuring their child's readiness, responsibility, and ultimate stability when living independently. It's clear that the mother deeply values education and financial security and wants to ensure that her children are set up for success. She is thorough in ensuring that her daughter is prepared for the real world.

Eric was indifferent of their body.;  B). Brett was indifferent of their body.;","output":"B). Brett was indifferent of their body. Eric often had liposuction but Brett did not, as Brett was indifferent of their body. The two individuals had distinctly contrasting views on body image and personal preferences when it came to self-care and appearance. While Eric felt the need to undergo liposuction to achieve his desired aesthetic, Brett remained at peace with their body as it was. Eric's decision to frequently opt for liposuction could have stemmed from various reasons, such as societal pressure, personal insecurities, or wanting to achieve a certain standard of beauty. Liposuction, a popular cosmetic surgery procedure, involves the removal of fat from specific parts of the body to enhance its overall shape and contour. By undergoing this procedure, Eric likely aimed to gain more confidence and satisfaction in his appearance. On the other hand, Brett's indifference towards their own body allowed them to embrace a different perspective on personal appearance and self-worth. Instead of focusing on physical attributes and adopting cosmetic procedures to conform to societal norms, Brett prioritized other aspects of their life, such as relationships, personal growth, or career achievements. They may have practiced body positivity, accepting their body for what it was, or believed that physical appearance held little importance compared to other determining factors of success and happiness. Thus, the contrast between Eric and Brett's outlooks on their bodies serves as a reminder of the vast array of attitudes and preferences people can hold when it comes to personal appearance and self-care. While some, like Eric, may choose to undergo procedures such as liposuction to feel more confident, others, like Brett, may find solace in being indifferent to their body and focusing on other aspects of life.

Yes or no? Answer: \\"The Princess and the Pea\\" (; literal translation: \\"The Princess on the Pea\\") is a literary fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen about a young woman whose royal identity is established by a test of her physical sensitivity. Question: where is the princess from in The Princess and the Pea Answer:","output":"The original Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale, \\"The Princess and the Pea,\\" does not specifically mention the country or kingdom from which the princess originates. However, the storyline provides some hints and context that can help give a detailed understanding of the situation. In the story, the prince is on a quest to find a true princess to marry. He travels through various kingdoms, encountering several princesses in his journey. Still, none of them are able to prove their genuine royal lineage, much to his disappointment, as there are always certain doubts about their authenticity. One stormy night, a young woman arrives at the castle, drenched by rain and claiming to be a princess. The queen, who wants to test the young woman's claim to royalty, places a single pea beneath twenty mattresses and twenty featherbeds where the alleged princess would sleep. According to the queen's belief, only someone of true royal birth would be sensitive enough to feel the pea under all those layers. As it turns out, the young woman has a sleepless night due to discomfort caused by the pea, thus proving her noble background and sensibility. The prince, now satisfied and delighted, proposes to her, and they have a grand wedding ceremony. Although the kingdom from which the princess comes is never explicitly named, the story's focus on proving one's royal identity emphasizes the importance of nobility and lineage. In summary, the fairy tale does not specify the exact location or kingdom of which the princess is a part; instead, the author Hans Christian Andersen focuses on the theme of sensitivity, nobility, and the journey of finding a true princess. The fairy tale serves as a symbol of royalty and the distinct characteristics that princes and princesses should possess, allowing their noble nature to shine through, even when tested by the slightest adversities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Eager shoppers in the United States brace themselves for long queues and competitive store atmospheres, all in the hopes of bagging the best deals. This year, however, the traditional scrum of sharp elbows was notably less intense. COVID-19-related restrictions, a rise in online shopping, and retailers stretching sales across November have all contributed to a tamer Black Friday experience. Step 1: Discuss COVID-19-Related Restrictions The global pandemic has brought forth several restrictions and guidelines to protect public health, and these measures have had a significant impact on Black Friday sales. Though some stores remained open, measures such as limited in-store capacities, social distancing, and mask mandates deterred many from partaking in the typical Black Friday dash. As people prioritize health and safety, retail experiences have needed to adapt. Step 2: Examine the Rise in Online Shopping The surge in online shopping was another significant factor contributing to a less chaotic Black Friday. With many shoppers looking to avoid crowded spaces, they turned to the comforts of their homes and the convenience of their devices. This shift towards e-commerce has helped maintain sales momentum, as retailers provided fantastic online deals and offers. Consequently, this satisfied the bargain-hunting appetites of consumers, all while avoiding the frenetic in-store experience. Step 3: Look at Extended Black Friday Sales In a bid to facilitate a safer shopping experience, retailers have stretched Black Friday sales across November, starting earlier than usual, and even referring to the entire month as \\"Black November.\\" Some stores even offered week-long or month-long deals to avoid the typical one-day rush, allowing shoppers to take their time and plan their purchases more strategically. This extension of sales has significantly dispersed the crowd and reduced the physical stress on the actual day of Black Friday. Conclusion Black Friday 2021 gave bargain hunters a tamer shopping experience, with less of the traditional sharp elbow jostling, thanks to an adaptation of retail practices in response to the pandemic. Shoppers and retailers alike have embraced a combination of COVID-19 restrictions, a shift towards online shopping, and extended sale periods, all of which contributed to the more serene atmosphere witnessed this year. As the world continues to overcome these unprecedented challenges, it is essential for industries to adapt and find safer ways to cater to consumers' needs, and this Black Friday serves as a promising example."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which person had a greater chance of suffering permanent brain damage?  Tammy and Rob rode a tandem bike down the hill. They hit a large rock and fell. Tammy wound up in the hospital and was diagnosed with a serious brain injury. Rob suffered only a mild concussion.  Hint: A person with a serious brain injury usually suffers permanent brain damage. These brain injuries usually occur when an external mechanical force, such as a violent blow or jolt to the head or body, causes brain dysfunction. An object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet or a shattered piece of the skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury. As a result, the person may have trouble talking or controlling body movements. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain was injured. Serious brain injuries can also cause personality changes and problems with mental abilities such as memory. Medicines, counseling, and other treatments may help people with serious brain injuries recover from, or at least learn to cope with, their disabilities.

All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico have allowed right turns on red since 1980, except where prohibited by a sign or where right turns are controlled by dedicated traffic lights.

What is the answer to this question? who played chewbacca in star wars episode 4?","output":"The actor who played Chewbacca in Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, the first film released in the iconic Star Wars series in 1977, was Peter Mayhew. He was a British-American actor who stood at 7 feet 3 inches (2.21 meters) tall, making him an ideal choice to portray the towering Wookiee co-pilot of the Millennium Falcon. Born on May 19, 1944, in London, England, Peter Mayhew worked in several different capacities before his role in Star Wars, including a brief stint as a hospital orderly. George Lucas, the creator of Star Wars, had initially cast bodybuilder David Prowse to play Chewbacca. However, Prowse opted to play the role of Darth Vader instead, opening the door for Mayhew. Mayhew portrayed Chewbacca, the loyal and lovable sidekick of Han Solo, played by Harrison Ford. The character of Chewbacca was an extremely tall, hairy, and bipedal creature from the planet Kashyyyk, with an appearance inspired by George Lucas's own Alaskan Malamute dog. The chemistry between Harrison Ford and Peter Mayhew on screen was evident, making Han Solo and Chewbacca one of the most memorable duos in cinematic history. Chewbacca quickly became a fan favorite due to his loyalty, bravery, and friendship with Han Solo, despite communicating only through a series of growls and roars, which were later dubbed over by sound designer Ben Burtt. Mayhew was able to convey a range of emotions through his body movements and expressive eyes. Peter Mayhew reprised his role as Chewbacca in The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Return of the Jedi (1983), and Revenge of the Sith (2005), before passing the torch to Finnish actor Joonas Suotamo due to his declining health. Suotamo served as a body double for Mayhew in The Force Awakens (2015) and took over the role of Chewbacca completely in subsequent Star Wars films and appearances. Sadly, Peter Mayhew passed away on April 30, 2019, but his portrayal of Chewbacca remains an enduring and well-loved aspect of the Star Wars universe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A: A:","output":"Bone fractures are breaks or cracks in the bones, which can occur due to various factors. The primary causes of bone fractures can be broadly grouped into two categories - traumatic fractures and pathological fractures. 1. Traumatic fractures: Traumatic fractures are caused by external forces applied to the bone, either directly or indirectly. They are the most common type of fractures and can occur due to several reasons: a) Accidents: Accidents, such as automobile crashes and falls, are major causes of traumatic fractures. Sudden impacts or forced movements can cause bones to break or crack. In elderly people, falls are particularly dangerous and can result in hip and wrist fractures. b) Sports and physical activities: High-impact sports like football, rugby, or basketball, as well as activities like skiing or gymnastics, can lead to fractures due to the intense force applied to the bones during these activities. Stress fractures can also develop in athletes due to repetitive stress on specific bones. c) Physical assault: Violent impacts or forceful twisting caused by assaults can result in bone fractures. Fractures caused by physical assault might include skull fractures, facial fractures, or rib fractures. 2. Pathological fractures: Pathological fractures occur when a bone that has been weakened by a disease or condition breaks due to minor stress or force, which would not normally cause a fracture in a healthy bone. Several factors can contribute to bone weakness and pathological fractures: a) Osteoporosis: Osteoporosis is a condition characterized by the loss of bone mineral density and bone strength, leading to an increased risk of fractures, especially in the spine, wrist, and hip. It is more common in older people, particularly women who have gone through menopause. b) Osteogenesis imperfecta: This is a genetic disorder that causes brittle and fragile bones. People with osteogenesis imperfecta are more prone to fractures, even from mild impacts or movements. c) Infections: Bone infections, such as osteomyelitis, can weaken the bone structure and cause fractures. Bacterial or fungal infections can cause inflammation and gradual destruction of bone tissue, increasing the risk of fractures. d) Bone tumors: Benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) tumors can grow within the bone and weaken the bone structure. Malignant tumors, such as osteosarcoma or Ewing's sarcoma, can cause pathological fractures and spread cancer cells to other parts of the body. e) Nutritional deficiencies: Deficiencies in crucial nutrients like calcium, vitamin D, and phosphorus can lead to weak bones, and eventually bone fractures. Ensuring a balanced diet with adequate amounts of these nutrients is crucial in maintaining bone health. f) Metabolic diseases: Some metabolic disorders, like hyperparathyroidism, can lead to bone weakness and fractures. The disorder disrupts the balance of calcium and phosphate in the body, resulting in the loss of bone density. g) Medications: Certain medications, including corticosteroids and anti-seizure medications, can adversely affect bone density and increase the risk of fractures. Preventing bone fractures involves maintaining healthy bone density and strength through proper nutrition, regular exercise, and early detection of bone diseases. In addition, taking safety precautions while engaging in sports or physical activities and avoiding accidents can help reduce the risk of traumatic fractures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Dietary supplements are big business, with around half of the Australian population using at least one type per year; most commonly a multivitamin and mineral pill. Many people take supplements as a form of dietary insurance in case they are not meeting their nutrient needs from foods alone. Others take them as a form of health insurance – to protect against certain diseases. Some just take them out of habit. Supplements do have a role to play in some situations. People with a diagnosed deficiency, those with malabsorption conditions, women planning pregnancy, and people with very poor diets all can benefit from specific nutrient supplementation. But what about the benefit of supplements across the broad population? The mantra of most health professionals, which is even etched on the label of many supplements, is that supplements may only be of assistance if dietary sources are lacking. To see if this is supported by solid evidence, a systematic review of 63 clinical trials involving some form of supplementation in non-pregnant adults was carried out by a team of medical researchers. The clinical trials were broad in their nature with many nutrients studied including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D and E; folic acid; calcium; selenium, omega-3 fatty acids; ginkgo biloba; glucosamine; saw palmetto; and milk thistle. All of the studies were randomised controlled trials and evaluated a range of health outcomes including risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, bone fractures, cognitive function and all-cause mortality. From the 63 studies, no benefit was seen in 45 studies with 10 of these showing a trend towards harm and just two showing a trend towards a benefit. Of the remaining studies, four showed harm with a greater risk of cancer with beta-carotene and a higher risk of fractures with a once-yearly dose of vitamin D. One study showed a lower risk of cancer with selenium supplementation, but this was not validated in much larger trials. Twelve studies showed a benefit and these mostly involved vitamin D...

Black people is a term used in certain countries, often in socially based systems of racial classification or of ethnicity, to describe persons who are perceived to be dark-skinned compared to other given populations. As such, the meaning of the expression varies widely both between and within societies, and depends significantly on context. For many other individuals, communities and countries, \\"black\\" is also perceived as a derogatory, outdated, reductive or otherwise unrepresentative label, and as a result is neither used nor defined.  Different societies apply differing criteria regarding who is classified as \\"black\\", and these social constructs have also changed over time. In a number of countries, societal variables affect classification as much as skin color, and the social criteria for \\"blackness\\" vary. For example, in North America the term black people is not necessarily an indicator of skin color or majority ethnic ancestry, but it is instead a socially based racial classification related to being African American, with a family history associated with institutionalized slavery. In South Africa and Latin America, for instance, mixed-race people are generally not classified as \\"black.\\" In South Pacific regions such as Australia and Melanesia, European colonists applied the term \\"black\\" or it was used by populations with different histories and ethnic origin.

If Senator Ghitter is correct about his interpretation of the motion, that would mean that the committee adopted a proposition that was contrary to the Rules of the Senate while he was in the chair; that he and the other committee members and the clerk of the committee understood this motion to mean that he had to report by twelve noon today, even though the Senate would not be sitting until 4 p.m. today; and that no one, including himself, knew that this would be contrary to the rules. Can we draw the following conclusion? Senator Ghitter knows some rules of the senate,","output":"but he may lack comprehensive knowledge and understanding of all pertinent rules, leading to potential oversight in executing his duties as the chairperson of the committee. To fully analyze this scenario, let's first explore the key points raised in this assumption. 1. The committee adopted a proposition contrary to the Rules of the Senate while Senator Ghitter was in the chair: As the chairperson of the committee, it is inherently presumed that Senator Ghitter should possess a firm grasp of the Senate rules. However, it appears that he and the other committee members might not have been completely familiar with all the rules, causing them to adopt a proposition that clashed with the existing Senate regulations. 2. Senator Ghitter and other parties thought the motion implied he had to report by twelve noon today, while the Senate would only be in session later in the day: This suggests that there might have been a misinterpretation or lack of clarity regarding the motion. Moreover, it highlights the possibility of inadequate communication between the committee members or perhaps a lack of procedural clarity in the Senate rules. 3. No one, including Senator Ghitter, was aware that the adopted motion was contrary to the rules: In this case, it seems Senator Ghitter's knowledge of the Senate rules might be limited or at least not comprehensive enough to identify the contradiction. This lack of awareness could have also stemmed from the overall ambiguity in the motion or the language used. Considering the context and the points raised, we can indeed conclude that Senator Ghitter knows some rules of the Senate. Simultaneously, it is important to acknowledge his potential lack of comprehensive knowledge of all the applicable rules, which led to the committee adopting a proposition contrary to the Senate rules.  It is essential for members of any governing body, including Senator Ghitter, to possess a thorough understanding of the rules and procedures that guide their decision-making processes. This enables them to function effectively and uphold the integrity of the institution. Thus, Senator Ghitter should take this experience as an opportunity to further familiarize himself with all the relevant Senate rules to avoid future inconsistencies or potential conflicts with the rules and procedures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: Dozens of Labour MPs employ staff on zero-hours contracts — despite Ed Miliband claiming they have 'no place in the 21st century'. Official figures from Parliament's expenses watchdog show 36 Labour MPs employed staff on the casual contracts last year. Some of Mr Miliband's closest allies in the Labour Party have used the contracts – including his election campaign co-ordinator Lucy Powell and parliamentary bag carrier Karen Buck – who has six staff on the contracts. Ed Miliband claimed zero-hours contracts have 'no place in the 21st century' - even though 36 Labour MPs employ staff on them. Mr Miliband has repeatedly criticised zero-hours contracts and companies using them. Just last week he said: 'If you are working regular hours then you should get a regular contract.' Zerohours contracts allow a company to vary the number of hours staff can work each week or month between full-time and none at all. Labour has insisted it is not 'exploiting' workers and the casual contracts were typically of those used to take on interns part-time. But the revelation is an embarrassment for Mr Miliband, who has vowed to tackle the 'epidemic' of zero-hours contracts if Labour wins power. Last year, Mr Miliband slammed the high street giant Sports Direct, owned by Newcastle United chief Mike Ashley. He said: 'Sports Direct has predictable turnover, it is a modern company with stores on many high streets and, judging by its success, where many people shop,' he will say. 'But for too many of its employees, Sports Direct is a bad place to work. This is not about exceptional use of zero-hours contracts for short-term or seasonal work … This is the way Sports Direct employs the vast majority of its workforce. These Victorian practices have no place in the 21st century.' Last year Mr Miliband hit out at the high street chain Sports Direct for employing its staff on zero hours contracts. Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley has come under fire from politicians and union bosses for employing thousands of workers on zero-hours contracts. Last year it emerged even the shadow chancellor Ed Balls employed four staff on zero-hours contracts. Several Labour-run councils also employ staff on zero hours, including Doncaster Council, the authority in Mr Miliband's constituency which admitted employing 300 people on the contracts. Freedom of Information inquiries show that in 2013, Derby Council employed 1,333 people on the contracts, Gateshead 1,285 and Bury 3,418. All are run by Labour. Conservative MP Julian Smith MP told MailOnline the figures exposed the 'same old do-as-we-say-not-as-we-do hypocrisy from the Labour Party'. He said: ‘Ed Miliband might say he’s against zero hours contracts but his MPs ignore him and use them anyway. They are in chaos. ‘They have no long-term economic plan and can’t be trusted to keep any of their promises.’","output":"1.

Labour has defended their use of casual contracts, claiming they are not exploiting workers and that the contracts are typically used for part-time intern appointments.  4.

Q:I read this background article the other day: The theory of evolution by natural selection was proposed at about the same time by both Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, shown in Figure below , and was set out in detail in Darwin's 1859 book On the Origin of Species . Natural selection is a process that causes heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common, and harmful traits, or traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival to become more rare in a population of organisms. This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more \\"fit\\" to survive in a particular environment and have \\"adapted\\" to the conditions of that environment. These individuals will have greater reproductive success than organisms less fit for survival in the environment. This will lead to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous trait(s) over time. Over many generations, adaptations occur through a combination of successive, small, random changes in traits, and natural selection of those variants best-suited for their environment. Natural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology.  I am facing a new situation today: David wants to revisit the theory of evolution proposed by Darwin and Wallace. He is particularly interested in two species of deer, species A and species B. Species A has some helpful traits, but species B has some harmful traits. He is planning to write a paper on why some species are greater in number while others are smaller in number.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which species would decrease in number, species A and species B? A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article on the theory of evolution by natural selection, we can effectively address the question about which species, species A or species B, would decrease in number. To recap, the process of natural selection favors individuals with heritable traits that are advantageous for survival and reproduction in their specific environment. Over time and many generations, organisms that possess these helpful traits will increase in number as they are more likely to survive and reproduce successfully. On the other hand, organisms with harmful traits or traits that do not confer any advantage for survival will have a harder time surviving and reproducing, leading to a decrease in their numbers. In the situation you described, species A has some helpful traits, while species B has some harmful traits. According to the theory of evolution by natural selection, we would expect species A to experience an increase in population size as the individuals with helpful traits are better adapted to their environment and have greater reproductive success. In contrast, species B, with harmful traits, should decrease in number as their individuals are less adapted to their environment and might struggle to survive and reproduce. David's paper should focus on the principles of natural selection as proposed by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, and the fact that species with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and increase in number, while species with harmful traits are more likely to struggle and decrease in number. When examining the case of species A and species B, David should analyze how the specific helpful traits of species A contribute to its survival and reproductive success, while also examining how the harmful traits of species B affect its chances of survival and reproduction. Additionally, David could delve into the environmental factors that might favor or hamper the survival and reproduction of each species, and how these factors may influence the natural selection process. Discussing factors such as predation, competition, and available resources will help provide a comprehensive understanding of why species A with helpful traits is more likely to increase in number, while species B, with harmful traits, might decrease in number over time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Spielberg was born on December 18, 1946 in Cincinnati, Ohio. His mother, Leah (nee Posner, later Adler; January 12, 1920 - February 21, 2017), was a restaurateur and concert pianist, and his father, Arnold Spielberg (born 1917), was an electrical engineer involved in the development of computers. His family was Orthodox Jewish. Spielberg's paternal grandparents were Jewish Ukrainian immigrants who settled in Cincinnati in the 1900s; his grandmother was from Sudylkiv, while his grandfather was from Kamianets-Podilskyi. A collector of film memorabilia, Spielberg purchased a balsa Rosebud sled from Citizen Kane (1941) in 1982. He bought Orson Welles's own directorial copy of the script for the radio broadcast The War of the Worlds (1938) in 1994. Spielberg has purchased Academy Award statuettes being sold on the open market and donated them to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, to prevent their further commercial exploitation. His donations include the Oscars that Bette Davis received for Dangerous (1935) and Jezebel (1938), and Clark Gable's Oscar for It Happened One Night (1934).  Spielberg is a major collector of the work of American illustrator and painter Norman Rockwell. A collection of 57 Rockwell paintings and drawings owned by Spielberg and fellow Rockwell collector and film director George Lucas were displayed at the Smithsonian American Art Museum July 2, 2010 - January 2, 2011, in an exhibition titled Telling Stories.  Spielberg is an avid film buff, and, when not shooting a picture, he will watch many films in a single weekend. He sees almost every major summer blockbuster in theaters if not preoccupied and enjoys most of them.  Since playing Pong while filming Jaws in 1974, Spielberg has been an avid video gamer. Spielberg played many of LucasArts adventure games, including the first Monkey Island games. He owns a Wii, a PlayStation 3, a PSP and Xbox 360, and enjoys playing first-person shooters such as the Medal of Honor series and Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. He has also criticized the use of cutscenes in games, calling them intrusive, and feels making story flow naturally into the gameplay is a challenge for future game developers.

Question: When did EL Greco have his epic journey? Movie title: El Greco Movie plot: The film tells the story of Domenicos Theotokopoulos, better known as El Greco, a great Greek artist of the 16th century with an uncompromising character, who sets off from his homeland Crete and goes to Venice and finally Toledo, in search of freedom and love. There he is confronted by his greatest adversary, the Spanish Inquisition, but his creative consciousness and power make him stand out and overcome barbarity and ignorance. Being imprisoned and awaiting execution by the Spanish Inquisition, Domenicos (Nick Ashdon) writes out his story, thus parts of his life play out in extended flashbacks. Born on the island of Crete, which was at the time part of the Republic of Venice, he falls in love with Francesca (Dimitra Matsouka), daughter of the Venetian governor of Crete. But his father is preparing a political rebellion and as a result Domenicos leaves the island and moves to Venice, away from the young woman. There he meets the famous painter Titian (Sotiris Moustakas) and the Spanish priest Fernando NiÃ±o de Guevara (Juan Diego Botto). Guevara immediately shows a confused interest in Domenicos, and, when roiled[clarification needed] by the Greek - and fighting personal demons - calls Domenicos before the Inquisition where he must defend himself against charges of heresy. Answer:","output":"El Greco's epic journey began in the mid-16th century, when he left his homeland of Crete for Venice, and later, Toledo. The exact date of this journey may vary, as there are differing accounts of his life and travels. However, it is known that he arrived in Venice around 1567, and in Toledo around 1577.

Companies had not been allowed to make use of images where features smaller than 50cm were visible.      But one imaging firm, Digital Globe, said it would be able to sell images that showed features as small as 31cm.      One lawyer told the BBC he expected \\"repercussions\\" from people worried about their privacy.      Marc Dautlich, from Pinsent Masons, said there may be \\"national security considerations\\" to address as well.

The decision was made after Digital Globe applied to the US Department of Commerce asking for restrictions to be lifted.      'Manholes and mailboxes'      Digital Globe said new satellites would be launched to take advantage of the ruling.      The company's Worldview-3 satellite is due to launch in August and will be able to show \\"key features such as manholes and mailboxes\\".      \\"In the past, collecting sub-50cm resolution required chartering and flying aircraft,\\" the company said.      \\"This is expensive, time-consuming, and can be limited by denied airspace or dangerous conditions.\\"      Jeffrey Tarr, Digital Globe's chief executive, said: \\"We are very pleased and appreciative that the US Department of Commerce has made this forward-leaning change to our nation's policy that will fuel innovation, create new high-tech jobs, and advance the nation's commanding lead in this strategically important industry.      \\"Our customers will immediately realise the benefits of this updated regulation, as for the first time, we will be able to make our very best imagery available to the commercial market.\\"      As well as for general public use, the higher-quality images can have other uses, the company said, such as aiding agriculture efforts and disaster relief.      Google recently announced it was planning to purchase an alternative satellite imaging company, Skybox, for 500m (£295m). The company currently has one satellite in orbit - SkySat-1 - but hopes to eventually launch a total of 24.

If I'm a little uncomfortable with the way the question invites a sense of cultural superiority., can we conclude that \\"The question poses no problems. \\"?  a. yes; b. it is not possible to tell; c. no;","output":"c. No The comfort level one experiences with a question is influenced by a multitude of factors such as personal beliefs, experiences, and cultural backgrounds. If you're uncomfortable with the way a question invites a sense of cultural superiority, this suggests that the question indeed does pose a problem on an individual level. At the very least, it is problematic from the perspective of promoting equal attention, respect, and appreciation for all cultures.  A question that invites a sense of cultural superiority can perpetuate stereotypes and harms associated with cultural bias, cultural appropriation, and ethnocentrism. It can also exhibit offensive or disrespectful undertones, marginalize diverse groups, exacerbate inequalities, and discourage multicultural understanding. Thus, your discomfort in such a scenario challenges the statement, \\"The question poses no problem.\\" Cultural sensitivity, equality, and respect are critical when forming and posing questions. Tolerance and understanding are crucial components of communication, enabling us to bridge the gap between cultures and facilitate the sharing of diverse perspectives. However, on a societal or collective level, whether or not the question is problematic may depend on the prevailing norms, values, and level of cultural sensitivity. If these aspects of society also echo your discomfort, a shared consensus might determine the question as problematic. The underlying fact remains that sensitivity to questions implying cultural superiority is integral to ethical and respectful communication. Therefore, affirming that \\"The question poses no problems\\" is not possible in this case.  So, recognizing your discomfort and treating it seriously is a step toward advocating for culturally sensitive dialogue, which implies minimizing cultural bias and promoting inclusivity and respect for all cultures."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The commission had ordered the LSE to sell its 60% stake in MTS, a fixed-income trading platform. However, the LSE said the request was \\"disproportionate\\". It warned investors it would struggle to sell MTS and that such a sale would harm its ongoing business. As a result, the LSE said: \\"Based on the commission's current position, LSE believes that the commission is unlikely to provide clearance for the merger.\\" The two rival exchanges announced plans for a \\"merger of equals\\" about a year ago, aiming to create a giant trading powerhouse that would better compete against US rivals. They had already agreed to sell part of LSE's clearing business, LCH, to satisfy competition concerns before the commission's surprise demand concerning MTS earlier this month. The Commission had given the exchanges until Monday to come up with a proposal to meet that demand. LSE said that such a sale would need regulatory approval from several European governments and would hurt its wider Italian business. \\"Taking all relevant factors into account, and acting in the best interests of shareholders, the LSE Board today concluded that it could not commit to the divestment of MTS,\\" the exchange said on Sunday night. When the London Stock Exchange trumpeted its merger with Deutsche Boerse last year, the chairman, Donald Brydon, was remarkably relaxed about the Brexit vote. He and his German counterparts said the deal would go ahead regardless of the outcome. What they didn't know was that it would eventually fall foul of another aspect of the single market - Brussels' control of competition laws. The two sides have made no bones about the fact the merger would create a company with a powerful presence in key markets, and have offered a number of sops to competition authorities in an attempt to win their approval. But it was not enough; Brussels insisted the LSE cede control of MTS, an important Italian clearing house with a crucial role in the trading of Italian government debt. For the LSE board, this was a step too far.  A sale of MTS would be too harmful, the directors decided, and they have chosen not to meet an European deadline to say how they would get rid of it. The Brits say they want to go ahead with the merger, but it looks like an insurmountable obstacle. The LSE will either go it alone in a post-Brexit world, or - as has often seemed possible before, and even more so now - fall into the arms of one of the giant American exchanges. MTS is a relatively small part of LSE's business, but it is a major platform for trading European government bonds, particularly in Italy, where it is classified as a \\"systemically important regulated business\\". The LSE group also owns the Milan-based Borsa Italiana. The LSE said it remained convinced about the merits of a merger, but joining forces with Deutsche Boerse would be impossible unless the commission changed its stance. Deutsche Boerse said on Sunday night that it and the LSE would await a further assessment by the European Commission, which was expected to make a decision by the end of March. Syed Kamall, MEP for London and a member of the European Parliament's financial services committee, told the BBC: \\"I think this is good news for competition, and it's also good news for those who are worried that some business in London might be moved to Frankfurt via the back door.\\" The European Commission declined to comment. Shares in the London Stock Exchange fell 3% on the news.

Villegas' defense team claims his court-appointed attorney spent only 40 hours preparing for his trial. The murders have been attributed to two brothers, one of whom has since died. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Wrongful Conviction? Daniel Villegas' 1995 Conviction Raises Questions About Coerced Confession and Inadequate Representation Daniel Villegas, now 35, was convicted back in 1995 for the drive-by shooting of two men. The double murder, which took place more than two decades ago, sparked controversy due to the questionable circumstances surrounding Villegas' confession and the lack of physical evidence linking him to the crime. Now, new information has surfaced about the potential mishandling of his case and the possibility that the true culprits were two brothers, one of whom has passed away. Villegas was only 16 years old at the time of the drive-by shooting. During his interrogation, he confessed to the crime. However, he later recanted his confession, claiming that it had been obtained through coercion by police investigators. This begs the question: was his confession given willingly, or was it the result of aggressive police questioning? The timeline and circumstances surrounding his confession might hold the key to unraveling this mystery. Adding to the controversy surrounding the case is the striking absence of physical evidence connecting Villegas to the crime scene. In countless wrongful conviction cases, the presence of DNA or other physical evidence plays a vital role in linking suspects to the crime. However, in this case, not a shred of such evidence has been found to implicate Villegas in the double murder. In light of this absence of evidence, the defense team for Villegas has voiced concerns about the quality of his representation during the 1995 trial. They claim that Villegas' court-appointed attorney spent a mere 40 hours preparing for the trial, which is a frighteningly low amount of time given the gravity of the charges he faced. The lack of preparation seems to have played a pivotal role in the outcome of Villegas' trial, as key details in his defense might have been overlooked or dismissed. Interestingly, the two murders have been attributed to two brothers, one of whom has since passed away. If this is indeed the truth, it brings into question the legitimacy of Villegas' conviction and opens up the possibility that a serious miscarriage of justice occurred back in 1995. As we revisit this case, it is crucial to remember that justice must be served both for victims and for the accused. It is not enough to simply convict someone for the sake of closure; the integrity of our justice system relies on the accuracy and fairness of its judgments. In light of these recent revelations, it becomes apparent that the case against Daniel Villegas deserves a thorough reexamination to ensure that justice is genuinely upheld. In summary, the conviction of Daniel Villegas more than two decades ago continues to raise questions about coerced confessions, lack of physical evidence, and inadequate legal representation. With the murders being attributed to two other individuals, one must ask whether or not our justice system failed Villegas and if a wrongful conviction took place. It is imperative that this case be revisited to ensure that justice is properly served for all parties involved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday blasted former FBI director James Comey as an \\"untruthful slime ball,\\" and said it was his \\"great honor\\" to fire him. Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump has...

This represented a significant moment in Trump's presidency, as it proved a controversial decision due to the circumstances surrounding it. Comey's dismissal took place while the FBI was actively investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and potential ties between Trump's campaign and Russia. Such actions led to accusations from critics that Trump was attempting to obstruct justice, leading to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel to oversee the Russia investigation.  This firing marked the beginning of a contentious public relationship between Trump and Comey. Following his departure from the FBI, Comey embarked on a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" in which he extensively discussed his fraught relationship with Trump. The book was potentially damaging for the President, as Comey presented an image of Trump as a dishonest leader driven by ego and personal loyalty, rather than by a commitment to ethical governance. The Trump administration, in response, launched an aggressive campaign to discredit Comey. This included the establishment of a website by the Republican National Committee, lyincomey.com, that sought to highlight perceived contradictions and inaccuracies in Comey's book and statements. Trump himself also publicly derided Comey, referring to him as an \\"untruthful slime ball\\" and suggesting that he should face prosecution.

LZ Granderson says working for money is a job, not volunteerism. LZ: Second bill requires drug testing, even though few recipients abuse drugs. LZ: Creative ways exist to earn aid that don't exploit or demonize poor people.","output":"Title: Michigan Bill Aims High, but Does Welfare-to-Work Efforts Stigmatize Recipients? Introduction A proposed Michigan bill, if passed, would require specific welfare recipients to complete community service in exchange for their benefits. The welfare-to-work debate has always been contentious, with proponents arguing that recipient objectivity must extend beyond the financial realm. However, critics like esteemed commentator LZ Granderson have raised concerns that these efforts may stigmatize welfare recipients by blurring the distinction between volunteerism and paid employment. Mandating Community Service: A Job or Volunteering? LZ Granderson has criticized the notion of mandated community service for welfare beneficiaries, arguing that when a person is required to work in exchange for payment, it constitutes a job and not volunteerism. While the motive behind the bill may be to encourage self-sufficiency, it inadvertently undermines the notion of community service as voluntary and altruistic, thereby stigmatizing recipient involvement. Additionally, the bill implicitly equates welfare recipients to non-contributing members of society who must 'earn' their benefits - fostering an environment that is potentially hostile towards those who need assistance. Drug Testing: Efficient Policy or Discriminatory Practice? Another aspect of the proposed Michigan bill is the requirement for drug testing, despite the fact that only a small percentage of welfare recipients engage in substance abuse. The stipulation of mandatory drug tests perpetuates the stereotype that those in need are prone to substance abuse, which further aggravates the stigma experienced by welfare recipients. Considering the minimal evidence supporting drug abuse among welfare beneficiaries, the question arises whether such a policy is not only unethical but also an inefficient use of resources. Exploring Alternative Solutions: Empowerment over Exploitation Rather than exploiting or demonizing poorer populations, Granderson suggests that there are more creative ways to facilitate aid. These alternative methods can include skills training, mentorship programs, and educational opportunities that foster personal growth and self-sufficiency. By focusing on empowerment instead of punitive measures, welfare programs can counteract stigmatization and increase the likelihood that recipients will achieve lasting independence. An Asset-Based Approach to Welfare The ongoing discourse surrounding welfare and public assistance ought to focus on promoting the well-being of recipients from an asset-based perspective - meaning, helping individuals achieve their inherent potential while acknowledging their value to society. Bills like the one proposed in Michigan may be well-intentioned, but they run the risk of perpetuating negative stereotypes and alienating welfare recipients. In conclusion, it is crucial to approach the welfare-to-work debate with a nuanced and empathetic mindset - prioritizing empowerment and personal growth, as opposed to punishment or stigmatization. Policymakers and social service agencies alike should consider asset-based approaches that will help foster self-sufficiency among welfare recipients while avoiding potential exploitation or demonization."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Thanksgiving event is another first for Gabrielle Giffords marked another milestone in her recovery Thursday, serving Thanksgiving dinner to troops at a Tucson military base in what her office said was the first constituent event since an attempt on her life in January. Giffords and her husband, retired Navy captain , joined approximately 400 airmen, military retirees and their families at the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in her district. On the menu: a traditional Thanksgiving meal, plus prime rib, baked ham, shrimp, assorted cheeses and desserts. Her office said that base officials initially asked for a member of Giffords' staff to take part in the meal, but the three-term Democrat \\"decided she wanted to go herself.\\" This is just the congresswoman's third trip back to Tucson since she was shot in the head at a constituent event at a shopping center there on Jan. 8. Six others were killed in the shooting spree. Giffords continues to rehabilitate from the injuries she sustained that day, including what her office calls a \\"rigorous daily schedule of physical, occupational and speech therapy.\\" Her progress was documented in a recent ABC News special, tied to the release of a new book written by Kelly. She said she would run again for Congress next year only if she got better. She also recently recorded a message to her constituents, saying in part: \\"I want to get back to work. Representing Arizona is my honor. My staff is there to help you. They keep me informed on your behalf. I miss you. I miss home. I'll see you real soon.\\" Summary:","output":"A lady named Gabrielle Giffords, who is recovering from being hurt badly in January, did something very kind recently.

Ms Cooper says more offenders are now avoiding court action as \\"community resolutions\\" are instead being used. Police have disputed the claim they are not taking violence seriously. The Home Office, meanwhile, said the use of the resolutions - which can include apologies or compensation - for serious crimes was \\"not acceptable\\". Community resolutions are used by police to resolve low-level or minor offences through \\"informal agreement between the parties involved\\", instead of through the court system. They are aimed at first-time offenders and can be used where there has been an admission of guilt and after the victim's views have been taken into account. Data compiled by Labour from 15 of the 43 police forces showed there were 3,305 uses of community resolutions for domestic violence in 2013 - up from 1,337 in 2009. In a speech in Birmingham to mark Labour's summer campaign, Ms Cooper said the data is \\"deeply worrying\\" and suggests ministers are \\"turning their backs\\" on victims of domestic violence. She also repeated Labour's promise to ban the use of the resolutions for domestic and sexual violence. Speaking earlier on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ms Cooper said the aim of Labour's planned legislation was to ensure police intervened in cases of domestic violence. Ms Cooper said in her speech that community resolutions can be \\"very effective\\", but added that they should not \\"be used for violent offences, and especially not for domestic violence\\". She also accused the government, saying it \\"just doesn't take violence against women seriously\\". \\"For the police to simply take a violent abuser home to apologise risks making domestic violence worse and makes it even harder for victims to escape a cycle of abuse,\\" she said. Advice from the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) suggests community resolutions are suitable for crimes such as criminal damage, minor theft and anti-social behaviour. Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan from Greater Manchester Police, Acpo's lead on restorative justice, told Today community resolutions were given in less than 1% of cases categorised as domestic violence. He added the method is \\"specifically attuned to low level domestic abuse particularly where victims want that course of action\\". A Home Office spokeswoman said a review had already been conducted into the inappropriate use of community resolutions. She also said every police force in England and Wales had been written to by Home Secretary Theresa May instructing them to produce a domestic violence action plan. \\"It is not acceptable for the police to use out-of-court settlements for serious criminality and that is why the government is already reviewing how they are used,\\" the spokeswoman said. The Home Office is yet to respond to a consultation on the use of out-of-court disposals, which ended in January. Sandra Horley, chief executive of national domestic violence charity Refuge, said: \\"These types of remedies may be effective for some crimes - but domestic violence is not one of them\\". \\"When women make the extraordinarily brave step of reporting their partners to the police, they must feel confident that they have the full weight of the law behind them.\\" Hilary Fisher, of the charity Women's Aid, said: \\"Women tend not to call and ask for help until they've experienced violence for over five times, sometimes up to 30 times.\\" She said weak punishments would not deter these serial perpetrators who would think \\"if the police don't take it seriously why should I?\\"","output":"Yvette Cooper, a British Labour Party politician, expressed concern over the increasing use of community resolutions in cases of domestic violence. Community resolutions are measures used by the police to resolve low-level or minor offenses through informal agreements rather than through the court system, often used for first-time offenders. According to data collected by the Labour Party from 15 out of 43 police forces, the number of community resolutions for domestic violence cases increased from 1,337 in 2009 to 3,305 in 2013.  In a speech in Birmingham, Cooper called the data \\"deeply worrying\\" and accused ministers of \\"turning their backs\\" on victims of domestic violence. She reiterated Labour's promise to ban the use of community resolutions for domestic and sexual violence, stating that while they can be \\"very effective\\" in some cases, they should not be used for violent offenses, particularly domestic violence.

The Home Office has stated that the use of community resolutions for serious crimes is \\"not acceptable\\" and already conducted a review of their inappropriate use in domestic violence cases. Home Secretary Theresa May has instructed all police forces in England and Wales to develop a domestic violence action plan. Critics, including the chief executives of national domestic violence charities Refuge and Women's Aid, argue that community resolutions are not appropriate for addressing domestic violence and that victims need the full weight of the law behind them. Weak punishments, they contend, would not deter serial perpetrators who might not take the issue seriously if the police don't."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article: Todd Akin, the Republican candidate for senate in Missouri, said in an interview released this weekend that he did not support abortion for rape victims because:      \\"If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.\\"      The idea that rape victims cannot get pregnant has long roots. The legal position that pregnancy disproved a claim of rape appears to have been instituted in the UK sometime in the 13th century. One of the earliest British legal texts, Fleta, has a clause in the first book of the second volume stating that:      \\"If, however, the woman should have conceived at the time alleged in the appeal, it abates, for without a woman's consent she could not conceive.\\"      This was a long-lived legal argument. Samuel Farr's Elements of Medical Jurisprudence contained the same idea as late as 1814:      \\"For without an excitation of lust, or the enjoyment of pleasure in the venereal act, no conception can probably take place. So that if an absolute rape were to be perpetrated, it is not likely she would become pregnant.\\"      This \\"absolute rape\\" is not quite the same as Akin's \\"legitimate rape\\". Akin seems to be suggesting that the body suppresses conception or causes a miscarriage, while the earlier idea of Farr relates specifically to the importance of orgasm. Through the medieval and early modern period it was widely thought, by lay people as well as doctors, that women could only conceive if they had an orgasm.      The biological basis for this idea is what the historian Thomas Laqueur has termed the \\"one sex system\\". The one sex system suggests that women's reproductive organs are fundamentally based on men's reproductive organs, so the vagina is represented as an inverted penis, the ovaries are testes and so on. Women had \\"cooler\\" constitutions, and therefore lacked the heat or force to drive the gonads out of the body, to convert ovaries to testes.      Thinking of the sexual organs as mirrors of each other obviously led to questions about the existence of a female \\"seed\\" or ejaculate. There was a disagreement about the roles of male and female seed – did they mingle to create the offspring, or did they contribute different things? Whatever the female seed contributed to conception, it was thought necessary, and so in theory a female orgasm was as important as a male orgasm.      Not everyone agreed with this interpretation. Helkiah Crooke, in his 17th century anatomy book Microcosmographia suggested that women's sexual organs were not simply inverted versions of men's, and said that a woman's orgasm was not always needed, although conception was much more likely, and a pregnancy much more secure, if she had one.      Generally, though, the idea that a women had to orgasm in order to conceive (although not necessarily at exactly the same time as her male partner) was widespread in popular thought and medical literature in the medieval and early modern period. By logical extension, then, if a woman became pregnant, she must have experienced orgasm, and therefore could not have been the victim of an \\"absolute rape\\".      Medical theories of sex, reproduction and conception changed gradually through the 18th century, so that by the 19th century the female orgasm was considered much less important for conception, and the female \\"seed\\" – if it even existed – was of less significance to the foetus. In popular culture the idea of the essential female orgasm lingered, and seems to still exist in a mutated form today. |||||       Rep. Todd Akin (Jeff Roberson | AP)      Rep. Todd Akin, Missouri's Republican Senate nominee, caused a public outcry Sunday when he told a local television station that \\"legitimate rape\\" rarely leads to pregnancy.      \\"First of all, from what I understand from doctors [pregnancy from rape] is really rare,\\" Akin, the Republican Senate nominee in Missouri, said. \\"If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.\\"      Akin later issued an apology, saying he \\"misspoke\\" when he made an \\"off-the-cuff\\" remark. Empirical evidence suggests that he is indeed wrong: Research published in the Journal of American Obstetrics and Gynecology suggests over 30,000 pregnancies result from rape annually. \\"Rape-related pregnancy occurs with significant frequency,\\" the trio of researchers from the University of South Carolina concluded. \\"It is a cause of many unwanted pregnancies.\\"      A separate 2001 study - which used a sample of 405 rape victims between ages 12 and 45 - found that 6.4 percent became pregnant.      But while Akin is wrong in his assertion about rape and pregnancy, he certainly isn't alone. His remarks tapped into a strain of thinking that dates back to at least the 1980s, with anti-abortion politicians from Pennsylvania to Arkansas making the case that the trauma of rape can often prevent pregnancy. The argument does not come up frequently, but when it does, it nearly always leads to political controversy.      Pennsylvania state Rep. Stephen Freind (R) was an ardent abortion opponent. He authored legislation that included one of the the nation's first abortion waiting periods, and the case went all the way to the Supreme Court.      He also looks to be the first legislator to make the argument that rape prevents pregnancy, arguing in the late 1980s that the odds of a pregnancy resulting from rape were \\"one in millions and millions and millions.\\"      His explanation? The trauma of rape causes women to \\"secrete a certain secretion which has the tendency to kill sperm.\\" Reproductive health experts immediately denounced those remarks. One told the Philadelphia Inquirer, \\"Boy, if I could find out what that [secretion] was, I'd use it as a contraceptive.\\"      The argument was dormant for about a decade, until the late 1990s. That's when a North Carolina legislator, whom Garance Franke-Ruta points to, extended the argument to question whether there should actually be a rape exception from abortion restrictions, given that \\"The facts show that people who are raped - truly raped - the juices don't flow.\\"      Arkansas politician Fay Boozman followed up during during his 1998 Senate campaign by arguing that \\"fear-induced hormonal changes could block a rape victim's ability to conceive.\\" Those remarks lead to a backlash when then-Gov. Mike Huckabee tapped Boozman to run the state's health department.      The argument was most recently - and perhaps most fully - articulated by National Right to Life president John Wilke in a 1999 essay titled \\"Rape Pregnancies Are Rare.\\" Wilke made a pretty similar case to Akin: That the \\"physical trauma\\" of rape has a way of preventing pregnancy.      \\"To get and stay pregnant a woman's body must produce a very sophisticated mix of hormones,\\" Wilke wrote. \\"There's no greater emotional trauma that can be experienced by a woman than an assault rape. This can radically upset her possibility of ovulation, fertilization, implantation and even nurturing of a pregnancy.\\"      The scientific evidence for this proposition is, unsurprisingly, shaky. Freind later backed off his theory about secretions, switching to an argument that rape would instead \\"delay, disrupt or prohibit ovulation by preventing the release of hormone-triggering factors.\\"      Wilke, the former Right to Life president, does not cite any evidence in his essay; \\"no one knows,\\" he says of the impact. That does not stop him from estimating that the physical trauma of rape \\"certainly cuts this last figure by at least 50 percent and probably more.\\"      Why do these arguments come up again and again, even if the scientific evidence - and public opinion - is clearly not in their favor? Usually, they come from legislators looking to push abortion regulations that tighten the constitutionally-required exceptions for cases of rape and incest.      That's what Friend was looking for back in 1988. And that's what Akin has pushed for in the House of Representatives. He was among the 227 co-sponsors of the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, introduced earlier this year by Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.)      That legislation, as initially written, who have prohibited federal funding for abortion except in cases of incest or \\"forcible rape.\\" That last term quickly-turned heads: It had the potential to significantly curtail Medicaid's ability to pay for an abortion for certain rape victims. Those who faced a statutory rape, where one party was too young to consent, could be left out.      That language was, much like Akin's Sunday remarks, walked back in the face of public outcry. The legislation was revised within days to include an exception for all rape victims. |||||Summary:","output":"In an interview, Republican candidate for Senate in Missouri, Todd Akin, claimed that he did not support abortion for rape victims because he believed that \\"if it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.\\" This idea has long roots, with the belief that rape victims cannot get pregnant appearing in legal texts dating back to the 13th century. Akin's claims have been debunked by research published in the Journal of American Obstetrics and Gynecology, which suggests that over 30,000 pregnancies result from rape annually."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: A Korean wave is sweeping across China, with many Chinese women worshiping South Korean actors Kin Soo-hyun and Lee Min-ho as demigods . Chinese netizens always have different opinions. Over South Korean TV dramas, but there is no doubt that programs from the neighboring country are now enjoying a new round of popularity in China, And a big part of the credit for that goes to You Who Came From The Star, the South Korean TV series which is on the air now. You Who Came From The Star and The Heirs   have been subjects of hot online discussions throughout Asia. Besides, the book, The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane, read by the hero You Who Came From The Star was a hard-to-get item on Amazon for a while. The two TV programs have several common elements  :a tall, handsome, and rich hero who loves the heroine blindly and always protects her, and an equally handsome man madly in love with the same woman. Both programs describe the purity of love, which is expressed through a kiss or a warm hug. Perhaps that's the secret of their success; perhaps people still like Cinderella-type stories. The widening wealth gap is a matter of social concern both in South Korea and China, and the challenges that young people face in their hope for a better life might have caused many ordinary girls to dream of marrying rich, caring men. This is precisely what the popular South Korean TV drams describe. _  Many netizens even said at an earlier time that South Korean TV dramas had become popular because of their stereotyped   themes: traffic accidents, cancer and other incurable diseases. But all that has changed with the success of You Who Came From The Star and The Heirs, which Chinese directors can use as examples, as well as inspiration, to improve their productions.

Translate to English","output":"Such a procedure also does not allow for the control of fishing vessels by the flag State, as required by Article 94 of the UNCLOS Convention. Article 94 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) is focused on the duties and responsibilities of the flag State, which is the country whose flag the fishing vessel is flying. UNCLOS is an international treaty that lays down the legal framework governing the use and conservation of the world's oceans and their resources. According to Article 94, the flag State has the primary responsibility to exercise jurisdiction and control over its fishing vessels on the high seas. This includes ensuring that they comply with safety, certification, and licensing requirements, as well as the adoption of laws and regulations regarding the operation, management, and conduct of fishing vessels and their crew members. Furthermore, the flag State must investigate and penalize individuals and legal entities that engage in illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing or breach other international and national rules. The statement you provided highlights the concern that the current procedure does not fulfill the requirements set out in UNCLOS Article 94, as it may not allow the flag State to effectively control and supervise its fishing vessels on the high seas. This is particularly important because IUU fishing poses a significant threat to the sustainability of marine resources, local economies, and global food security. To address these concerns, it is vital for flag States to step up their efforts to ensure compliance with national and international laws related to fisheries management and marine conservation. This could involve: 1. Strengthening national regulations and laws to improve monitoring, control, and surveillance of fishing activities. 2. Ensuring that all fishing vessels flying the flag State's flag have the necessary licenses and meet safety and certification requirements. 3. Implementing effective tracking and monitoring systems, such as vessel monitoring systems (VMS) and Automatic Identification System (AIS), to ensure transparency and traceability throughout the entire supply chain. 4. Pursuing international cooperation and information exchange with other relevant States and regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs) to detect and combat IUU fishing. 5. Increasing penalties and sanctions for non-compliance with fisheries laws and regulations to deter IUU fishing activities. By adopting these measures and balancing the interests of various stakeholders, flag States will be better equipped to fulfill their obligations under Article 94 of UNCLOS and contribute to the collective goal of protecting and managing the world's oceans and marine resources sustainably."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Montreal police say he was on the list of the top 10 criminals wanted by the Homeland Security Investigations unit of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.      Sychanta was arraigned in Montreal last Thursday on charges of drug possession, obstructing the work of police officers and using false documents. ||||| Montreal police patrolling on bicycles have arrested a man who turned out to be one of the most wanted suspects in the U.S.      Katay-Khaophone Sychantha, also known as Kao, was stopped last Wednesday by officers doing a routine patrol of a Montreal cycle path, who suspected Sychantha and another man of drug possession.      According to a police statement, Sychantha tried to flee on foot, but was quickly apprehended. When asked for identification, Sychantha produced an American identification card. The officers suspected the card was fake and took him into custody for further questioning.      Police fingerprinted Sychantha and noticed he had a missing fingertip on his right hand. When they ran the prints through their database, they learned the Laos-born man they had in their custody was the suspected ring leader in a large-scale drug and weapons smuggling operation.      U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement wanted Sychantha as the suspected leader of an organization that supplied ecstasy pills and marijuana to distributors in Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, Massachusetts, Georgia and New York.      He was also wanted by the Ontario Provincial Police for several drug trafficking offences.      The U.S. Department of Homeland Security considered him one of their most wanted, and offered a US25,000 reward for his capture.

Katay-Khaophone Sychantha, 35, reportedly a dual citizen of Canada and Laos, was arrested on Wednesday by two Montreal police officers based out of neighbourhood Station 7 who were patrolling a bike path in the St-Laurent borough near the Bois Franc train station. According to a statement issued by the Montreal police on Monday, Sychantha was with another man when they were approached by the officers who suspected they possessed drugs.      Sychantha tried to flee but was arrested after a short pursuit. He produced a fake American identification card, but the officers suspected he was trying to hide something and arrested him. He was eventually brought to the Montreal police West Operations Centre in the St-Laurent borough, where he was fingerprinted and his true identity was revealed.      According to the release, Sychantha is wanted by the Ontario Provincial Police on warrants involving a series of drug trafficking-related offences. He was also on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Ten Most Wanted list. The wanted poster on the ICE website alleges Sychantha, 35, was first indicted in Michigan in 2005 for conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance.      “Following this indictment, Sychantha evaded capture and continued to supervise a drug-smuggling organization based in the Windsor, Canada area. In 2013, Sychantha’s continued illicit activity led to a second indictment in the Eastern District of Michigan for Conspiracy to Distribute a Controlled Substance. He has a history of violence and has allegedly made threats against HSI Special Agents and other law enforcement officials,” the wanted poster notes. It describes Sychantha as someone who should be considered as “armed and dangerous.” He last known location is listed as being Lakeshore, Ont., a town just 40 kilometres from the U.S. border crossing into Detroit.      A statement issued by ICE following the arrest describes Sychantha as “the suspected ring leader of a drug-smuggling organization which supplied millions of ecstasy pills and hundreds of pounds of marijuana to several distributors located in Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, Massachusetts, Georgia, and New York.”      Sychantha appeared at the Montreal courthouse on Thursday where he was charged with drug possession, trying to mislead a police officer and with carrying fake identification. He is expected to be turned over to the Ontario Provincial Police and might eventually be extradited to the U.S.      The charges Sychantha faces in the U.S. involve a indictment that was filed more than a decade ago in a U.S. District Court in Michigan.

Following the aftermath of the team's loss to Dallas, the Bears turned to Brian Griese replace Rex Grossman. The change came in an attempt to protect the ball, and reduce turnovers. Nonetheless, the turnovers continued to haunt the team en route to a 37-27 loss against the Detroit Lions. The Lions took a first-quarter lead by blocking a Robbie Gould field-goal attempt, and then using the field position to score a field goal. The Bears' offense struggled to move the ball in the first quarter, and but began to pick up momentum in the second quarter. Griese threw a fifteen-yard touchdown to Muhsin Muhammad, but also threw two interceptions in two red zone visits. Jon Kitna and the Lions' top-tier passing offense exploited the Bears' injury-depleted secondary. He threw two touchdowns in the fourth quarter, to keep the Bears four points behind the Lions. Griese threw an interception to Keith Smith, who returned it for a touchdown. However, Devin Hester responded by returning the ensuing kickoff for a touchdown. The Lions established their running game later, and allowed Kevin Jones to score a rushing touchdown, sending the Lions up by ten again. Griese led the Bears downfield on the subsequent drive. After several unusual penalties and mishaps, the Griese threw a touchdown to Desmond Clark. Now trailing by three points, Gould attempted by an onside kick, but it was recovered and returned by Casey FitzSimmons, sealing the Bears' loss. The 34 points allowed in the fourth quarter by the Bears are the most in NFL history. Griese completed thirty-four of fifty-two passes for 286 yards, two touchdowns, and three interceptions in his first start as a Bear. The team's running game mustered a combined total of sixty-nine yards, ousted by the Lions' ninety-five yards. Both defenses unleashed equal punishment on their opposing quarterbacks, combining for a total of twelve quarterback sacks. The Lions' victory snapped their four-game losing streak against the Bears.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines that it provides. You solve the task and show how you used the guidelines to solve the task. Detailed Instructions: In this task, you need to indicate the presence of temporal reasoning in the provided question. Questions that involve temporal reasoning/understanding contain one of the following five temporal phenomena: First: \\"event duration\\", is defined as the understanding of how long events last (e.g.,\\"brushing teeth\\" usually takes a few minutes). Second: \\"transient v. stationary\\" events, which are based on the understanding of whether an event will change over time or not (e.g., \\"being born in the U.S.\\" is a stationary event since it will last forever; \\"being hungry\\" is a transient event since it lasts for a short period of time). Third: \\"event ordering\\" is the understanding of how events are usually ordered (e.g., \\"earning money\\" usually comes before \\"spending money\\"). Fourth: \\"absolute timepoint\\" of events which is the understanding of when events usually happen (e.g., \\"going to school\\" usually happens during the day, not at 2 A.M). The last category is \\"frequency\\" of events, which refers to how often events are repeated (e.g., \\"taking showers\\" typically occurs ~5 times a week, \\"going to Saturday market\\" usually happens every few weeks/months, etc.). Indicate with \`Yes\` if the question involves temporal reasoning. Indicate with \`No\`, otherwise. Q: Sentence: Lgurio informs Callimaco that Nicia and Lucrezia are anxious to have a child .

For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers  songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers.  - Un mondo perfetto is the second studio album by Italian singer Dolcenera, released on May 18,  2005 via Amarena Music/BMG Ricordi.

A: A:","output":"Desert plants have evolved processes to conserve water and deal with harsh conditions. A more efficient use of CO2 allows plants to adapt to living with limited water resources and extreme temperatures. Step 1: Understanding the question The user is asking how a more efficient use of CO2 helps plants adapt to living in desert conditions. Step 2: Considering the adaptations of desert plants Desert plants have developed various adaptations to survive in their harsh environment. Some of these adaptations include: - Efficient use of CO2: By using CO2 more efficiently, plants can conserve water and reduce the amount of water lost through transpiration. - Deep or widespread root systems: This allows desert plants to absorb water from a larger area, accessing water that may be deeper beneath the surface. - Reduced or modified leaves: Some desert plants have small or no leaves, which reduces the surface area for water loss through transpiration. In some cases, leaves may be replaced by spines as in the case of cacti, which also serves a protective function against herbivores. - Specialized photosynthesis processes: Some desert plants use a specialized form of photosynthesis called Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) to minimize water loss. CAM plants can open their stomata at night to absorb CO2, converting it into a stored form, and using it during the daytime for photosynthesis, thus reducing water loss through transpiration during the heat of the day. Step 3: Answering the user's question A more efficient use of CO2 allows desert plants to adapt to living with limited water resources and extreme temperatures. This adaptation helps them conserve water, minimize water loss through transpiration, and continue to conduct photosynthesis even under extreme conditions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This is the correct answer because Nissan is the car company that originally had the Datsun name. All the other options are either people, places, or other unrelated things, and they don't make cars.

If we assume that the question is discussing the relationship between weather and how it affects both humans and animals, we can analyze each of the provided options in that context: 1. Travel: Weather plays a significant role in determining whether humans and animals travel or not. For instance, extreme weather conditions such as storms, heavy rain, or snow can make it challenging for both humans and animals to travel or migrate in search of food, or to find a suitable living environment. In this context, if the weather influences your decision to travel or not, it may have a similar effect on the movements and migration patterns of animals. 2. Get cold: As temperature fluctuates with weather conditions, humans and animals alike can experience feelings of cold or warmth. Most living organisms are capable of adapting to their environment, and animals have various ways of regulating their body temperature to cope with external weather conditions. For example, some animals grow thicker fur in winter to stay warm, while others can change their behavior to avoid cold temperatures. Humans also adapt to the changing weather conditions by wearing appropriate clothing and taking other necessary measures. Therefore, if the weather makes you feel cold, it's likely that the animals around you will also experience cold temperatures and react to it accordingly. 3. Feel pain: Weather conditions, especially extreme ones, can sometimes cause pain or discomfort for both humans and animals. A common example is arthritis joint pain, which can be aggravated by cold, damp weather. Similarly, animals can also experience pain and discomfort due to weather conditions. For example, livestock can suffer during extreme heatwaves or prolonged exposure to cold weather. That being said, if the weather causes you to feel pain, it's possible that animals, too, may experience pain or discomfort as a result. 4. Move: While the initial question's phrasing is unclear, if the idea is that changing weather conditions influence the movement of humans and their animals, then the \\"option\\" relating to movement could be most suitable. For instance, if you decide to move indoors or to warmer places as a result of cold weather, the animals you care for, such as pets, would need to adapt to those changes as well. However, wild animals will naturally move in response to weather conditions to find shelter, food, or a suitable living environment. 5. Electrical circuit: This option doesn't seem to directly relate to the concept of how weather might affect humans and animals. Electrical circuits pertain to the flow of electric current in a closed path, which has little to do with the weather-how it directly impacts humans and animals. In conclusion, while the phrasing of the question is somewhat confusing, it appears that the topic focuses on how weather conditions can influence both humans and animals, particularly in terms of travel, getting cold, feeling pain, and movement. Choosing a most suitable answer likely depends on the specific aspect of human-animal interaction you are looking to address within the context of weather."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It is the second time he has been attacked with zelyonka (\\"brilliant green\\" in English) this year.      The dye is a common antiseptic in Russia and has been used in protests there and in Ukraine.      \\"It looks funny but it hurts like hell,\\" Mr Navalny tweeted.      It is not clear who carried out the attack, which happened near the offices of the Anti-Corruption Fund (FBK) that he founded.      According to one report (in Russian) he was diagnosed with a chemical burn to the eye.      Mr Navalny is one of the foremost Russian critics of President Vladimir Putin and has announced his intention to run for president himself.      But his intentions may be thwarted - he has been convicted of embezzlement, which would bar him from running for office, although he denies it.      A new weapon of choice - Vitaliy Shevchenko, BBC Monitoring      A mild antiseptic known as \\"brilliant green\\" has recently become a weapon of choice against government critics in Russia.      Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Footage from March appears to show Mr Navalny being attacked with a green liquid      Mr Navalny has been doused with it twice this year. One of Russia's most popular bloggers, Ilya Varlamov, had it thrown at him twice on the same day on 26 April. And pro-Western politician Mikhail Kasyanov had it splashed in his face at a rally commemorating murdered opposition activist Boris Nemtsov.      So why brilliant green? It stains the skin and is hard to wash off, which can be a problem if you want to take the media spotlight. Also, it doesn't do any lasting damage, which means attackers will not be facing charges of grave bodily harm.      But the attackers don't always have the last laugh. When Mr Navalny was last doused he turned his green face into an internet meme and was imitated by his supporters.      Mr Navalny was among 500 people arrested after organising an anti-corruption rally last month. Rallies across the country were the biggest opposition demonstrations in Russia in several years.      He has said repeatedly that he wants to challenge Vladimir Putin's control of the Kremlin and expose what he claims is the \\"myth\\" that Mr Putin commands more than 80% popular support.      Meanwhile a separate opposition group, Open Russia, says its office has been raided by police, a day after the group was blacklisted by the authorities.      Activists said more than 20 riot police raided the office and removed computer equipment and 100,000 flyers for an unsanctioned rally planned for this weekend.      Open Russia was founded by former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who lives in exile after spending 10 years in a Siberian prison on fraud charges, which he says were politically motivated. ||||| MOSCOW — Aleksei A. Navalny, the Russian opposition leader, said on Tuesday that a doctor told him he had lost 80 percent of the sight in one eye after suffering a chemical burn when an assailant threw a green liquid in his face last week.      The eye’s vision may improve, but the outlook is unclear, Mr. Navalny wrote on his website, citing his doctor.      Initially, the attack had appeared less serious; dousing opposition figures with green dye is a common occurrence and often attributed to pro-Kremlin activists. Typically, a type of topical medical disinfectant has been used. It is difficult to wash out but harmless.      Mr. Navalny, who has declared his intention to run in Russia’s presidential election next year, had already been splashed in the face with green dye once this spring, without any adverse affects. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

REUTERS/Tatyana Makeyeva/File Photo      By Andrew Osborn      MOSCOW (Reuters) - Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny is ineligible to run for the Russian presidency next year unless he can overturn a conviction for embezzlement, a senior election official was quoted as saying by Russia's RIA news agency on Wednesday.      Navalny, who says he sees no legal impediment to his presidential run, organized the biggest anti-government protests in years in March, and has become the most prominent opposition challenger to President Vladimir Putin, who is expected to run for what would be a fourth presidential term in March 2018.      Navalny's political plans were complicated in February when a court found him guilty of embezzlement at a retrial of a case which he said was politically-motivated and designed to sabotage his political career.      On Wednesday, a court rejected his appeal and upheld the original conviction which came with a five-year suspended prison sentence. Navalny's legal team said it would now appeal to the European Court of Human Rights.      Allies say that Navalny, a 40-year-old lawyer turned opposition leader, is entitled to run for the presidency next year under the Russian constitution despite the embezzlement conviction.      The law is not explicit on whether he can run, leaving room for interpretation.      Nikolai Bulayev, deputy chairman of Russia's Central Election Commission, told the RIA news agency on Wednesday that Navalny was currently ineligible to run and could only do so if he quashed his conviction via the courts.      \\"He (Navalny) is already trying to conduct a presidential campaign and, it seems to me, is manipulating people's understanding about how the law, allegedly, does not apply,\\" said Bulayev.      \\"It's a delusion. If he's doing this deliberately he's deluding other people. For now, as far as I understand, he does not have the right to stand for election and in order to get it he needs to act via the courts. There is no other way.\\"      Navalny says he has lost most of his sight in his right eye after an assailant threw green liquid in his face      If he is allowed to run and is up against Putin, who has not yet confirmed he will stand, opinion polls suggest Navalny will lose by a big margin.      Some analysts believe the Kremlin may ultimately allow Navalny to run in order to boost turnout and create the impression of some genuine political competition.      However, having Navalny on the ballot paper could be an irritant for the Kremlin by providing a focus for anti-Kremlin protests, especially in the big urban centers where Navalny draws most of his support.      Leonid Volkov, a Navalny ally, said on social media on Wednesday that he and fellow activists would fight for their leader's right to run.      \\"Nobody promised it would be easy,\\" said Volkov. \\"Navalny has the right to run, but ensuring he is able to exercise it won't be easy.\\"      (Editing by Christian Lowe) ||||| What Is \\"Zelyonka,\\" the Russian Green Dye Weapon of Choice? The dye has had a longer history as an antiseptic.      On Thursday Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny had brilliant green dye thrown into his face, staining his skin and dousing his right eye. It was the second time in the past two months that the Vladimir Putin critic and leader of the Anti-Corruption Foundation has been sprayed with this dye, known in Russia as zelyonka, an experience that he tweeted “looks funny but … hurts like hell.”      The liquid has become a recurring tool used by pro-government activists against critics of the Kremlin, in part because it’s considered to be nontoxic unless ingested. According to Radio Free Europe, the non-toxicity creates a safety net for the attackers in case they are caught. But in the case of Navalny, the dye may have been mixed with something else. The Moscow Times reported Monday that Navalny has been diagnosed with a “chemical burn in his right eye,” something that zelyonka presumably could not do on its own.      Having zelyonka splashed on you, added chemicals or not, is no picnic because of the stain that it leaves. Zelyonka is a diluted form of “brilliant green”, a triarylmethane dye. These are dyes that are intensely colored, produced industrially, but stem from organic compounds that contain the colorless solid triphenyl methane.

An attacker sprayed antiseptic in his eye today. https://t.co/fqTW0pYjh6 pic.twitter.com/Pvtsd9oNOI — The Moscow Times (@MoscowTimes) April 27, 2017      Zelyonka became popularized as an inexpensive antiseptic in the 1900s. Doctors at the time applied it to wounds and commended the dye for its “extraordinary results” in increasing the comfort of patients, despite “of occasional stained hands and clothes.” Today it is still commonly found in Russian homes and used as a go-to antiseptic for scrapes and cuts. As an antimicrobial agent, it’s demonstrated to be effective in preventing the development of infections — maybe it’s not quite “the best herpes killer” like it’s sold on Ebay, but it’ll make sure a scab doesn’t turn into a bigger issue.      It’s been demonstrated to be an effective way of turning anti-Putin critics green as well.

They find townspeople dead in the streets while reporting back to Scoop Mission Control. Suspecting the satellite may have brought back an extraterrestrial pathogen, Scoop Mission Control activates an elite scientific team it had previously recruited for just this type of emergency. Nobel laureate Dr. Jeremy Stone (Arthur Hill), the team leader, and Dr. Mark Hall (James Olson), the team surgeon, are dropped in Piedmont by helicopter, where they search the town for Scoop 7 in hazmat suits. They find the town's doctor, who died after opening the satellite out of curiosity. Hall cuts open the doctor's corpse and finds that all of his blood has clotted and turned to powder. Stone and Hall retrieve Scoop 7 and find two survivors â a 62-year-old man and an infant (who \\"can't be more than 6 months old\\"). The entire team of four core research scientists, including Dr. Charles Dutton (David Wayne) and Dr. Ruth Leavitt (Kate Reid), are summoned from their academic and research appointments to arrive at a top secret, high-tech underground laboratory in Nevada, named Wildfire, where they undergo a full day of decontamination procedures, descending through five rigorous disinfection levels of the lab. Before decontamination, Hall is informed that the facility's nuclear device has been armed and will go off automatically within five minutes should there be a containment breach. He is entrusted with a key to disarm the bomb from designated substations within that window. The team enter the facility under the impression that Piedmont has already been sterilized by a nuclear bomb. The team begins to experiment on the agent inside Scoop 7 and discovers that it is transmitted by air, kills lab animals instantly, and is too large to be a virus.

The given sentence translates to \\"You probably won't have much hair on your body, will you?\\" in English. The Czech language is closely related to other Slavic languages, particularly Slovak, with which it shares high mutual intelligibility. It uses the Latin alphabet with several additional diacritics, notably the háček (ˇ) and kroužek (˚), for certain consonants and vowels and to indicate specific sounds and pronunciation. Czech has a rich history and is a descendant of Old Czech, dating back to the 9th century when the Great Moravian Empire was established. The Czech language has many dialects, with Bohemian, Moravian, and Silesian being the most widespread. It gained importance during the rise of the Kingdom of Bohemia and the formation of the Czech National Revival in the 19th century, which resulted in the modern standard Czech language. Czech grammar is quite complex, with four genders for nouns (masculine animate, masculine inanimate, feminine, and neuter), seven cases (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative, locative, and instrumental), and several verb forms (e.g., aspect, tense, mood, and voice) as well as complex declensions for nouns, pronouns, and adjectives. Like most Slavic languages, the word order is relatively flexible, allowing for variations without changing the overall meaning of the sentence. This flexibility and complexity make Czech a challenging but rewarding language for learners."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Wentz was born Peter Lewis Kingston Wentz III, in Wilmette, Illinois, an affluent suburb of Chicago. He is the son of Dale (nee Lewis), a high school admissions counselor, and Pete Wentz II, an attorney. He is of English and German descent on his father's side and Afro-Jamaican on his mother's side. He has a younger sister, Hillary, and a younger brother, Andrew. Wentz has written a book entitled The Boy With the Thorn in His Side, a story based on nightmares he had as a child. The title is a reference to a track on The Smiths' album The Queen Is Dead. Wentz explained that writing books serves as another mode of self-expression other than songwriting: \\"My inspiration and my ideas don't begin and end at the beginning and the ending of a song. It is too limiting.\\" It was reported that he was to publish another book, entitled Rainy Day Kids, but years went by without any word on the book's progress, and Wentz even expressed on his  Twitter account that he didn't think it would ever come to fruition. However, in February 2012, he posted a photo on his personal blog of what appeared to be a rough draft of the book's manuscript, explaining that he was currently in the process of editing Rainy Day Kids and that it would be 40-50 pages longer than he originally expected. On December 13, 2012, Wentz revealed the cover for the book, now titled Gray, on his personal blog. The book, which was written with MTV News writer and former FNMTV co-host James Montgomery, was released on February 26, 2013.  In June 2009, it was announced that Wentz was working on a five-issue comic book mini-series called Fall Out Toy Works, to be published by Image Comics. The idea was conceived by Wentz and designer Darren Romanelli. The plot is loosely based on the Fall Out Boy song \\"Tiffany Blews\\" and focuses on \\"a mysterious toymaker, a cyborg gal named Tiffany and a kid in a bear suit that looks lifted from the cover of Fall Out Boy's Folie a Deux.\\" With writing by Brett Lewis, and art by Sam Basri, the first issue was released on September 2, 2009.

Q: You are presented with the quiz \\"The bonds of that which when heavy is Deuterium cause what to expand when it freezes?\\"   But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"hydrogen bonds cause water to expand when it freezes\\" and \\"deuterium, or heavy hydrogen, is an isotope of hydrogen, or a hydrogen atom with a neutron added\\".   So, what's the best answer to the question? The answer is:","output":"The bonds of deuterium cause water to expand when it freezes. Let me provide a detailed explanation for this answer. The original question asks about the bonds of a specific substance, deuterium, which expands when it freezes. Our teacher provided two hints: first, hydrogen bonds cause water to expand when it freezes, and second, deuterium, or heavy hydrogen, is an isotope of hydrogen with an added neutron. Deuterium is indeed an isotope of hydrogen, with the key difference being the presence of a neutron in its nucleus. One proton and one neutron make up the nucleus of a deuterium atom, while a regular hydrogen atom has only one proton and no neutrons. Despite this difference, both deuterium and regular hydrogen can form hydrogen bonds with oxygen atoms to create water molecules (H2O). In the case of deuterium, the resulting molecule is called \\"heavy water\\" (D2O). When water freezes, its hydrogen (H) bonds cause the molecules to form a hexagonal lattice, creating a less dense crystal structure compared to liquid water. This hexagonal lattice results in the expansion of water when it turns into ice.  In the case of heavy water, the hydrogen bonds are formed between deuterium (D) and oxygen (O) atoms. Since deuterium is an isotope of hydrogen, heavy water will similarly form a hexagonal lattice when it freezes, also resulting in expansion. Although there may be some differences in the lattice structure due to the presence of the extra neutron in deuterium, the basic principle of hydrogen bonding and the resulting expansion when freezing remains the same. In conclusion, the bonds of deuterium cause water to expand when it freezes due to the similar hydrogen bonding present in both regular water and heavy water molecules."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

you just stood there talking to your friend you shitbag! i've been watching you talk to your friend while you let this family rough house the whole fucking time! when i was a lifeguard...\\"  yada, yada, fuck me. i yell over to my friend to call 911, forgetting what state he's in.  at this point the kid and his family are fine, a fire fighter who was off duty was at the pool and he pulled the angry asshole patron aside.  the kid is conscious and complaining of a headache and the parents have been calmed.  the only thing i need is ems.   friend comes out holding the phone repeatedly saying, \\"they won't answer!\\" what the fuck does he mean they won't answer?  he's using his cell phone and pressing 911 on the lock screen, fuck.  i grab the phone and dial 911 and tell them what happened.  immediately after ems arrives and the family goes to the hospital i notify the supervisor and my manager.  supervisor shows up and has me doing all this paperwork, of course the asshole goes up to the supervisor and complains so fucking much about me.  supervisor was a total bitch and fired me on the spot for being incompetent.  the fire fighter came to my side when he saw me get fired and tried to convince the supervisor that i was watching the pool and made the right call, but she wasn't having it.  i had upset a patron to the point of hysterics and that was all she would hear.  my friend? finished the shift and got a pat on the back from the company.   in the end i learned that the kid had a seizure due to minor head trauma and lack of oxygen.  he spent some time underwater and then decided to launch himself off the side of the pool, while still underwater, and headbutt his dad as hard as possible.  the result was a random seizure.  freak incident but the kid is okay, my manager said if i needed a job recommendation she would give me a really good one.  that high fuck is still my best friend and i laugh about this story now with him.   asshole motherfucker + retarded child = chaos, unemployment, and a slightly more retarded child A:","output":"While working as a lifeguard, the narrator's high co-worker accidentally fell into the pool trying to signal a kid having a seizure, leading to chaos, the narrator being fired, and a funny story to share."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Definition: In mathematics, the absolute value of a number is the non-negative value of that number, without regarding its sign. For example, the absolute value of -2 is 2, and the absolute value of 5 is 5. In this task you will be given a list of numbers and you need to return the element with highest absolute value. If a negative and positive element have the same absolute value you should return the positive element. The absolute value for negative numbers can be found by multiplying them by -1. After finding the element with the maximum absolute value you should return the value of that element before you applied the absolute value. Input: [-89.355 -95.046 -54.153 -62.963  20.419 -37.435  64.527  49.464   9.087] Output:","output":"-95.046 Explanation: The given task requires us to: 1. Understand the list of numbers. 2.

Please briefly summarize this news article: In a Florentine Palazzo, History with a Dash of Playfulness Rooms from 140 euros (about 156); from 250 euros in high season. Themes weave prominently throughout the aptly named Garibaldi Blu Hotel. Opened in December 2014 in a historic Florentine palazzo, the 21-room boutique hotel takes its name from the property’s history: A plaque outside states that the building was the site of a memorable 1867 address by Giuseppe Garibaldi, the Italian general and politician who was a major figure in the unification of what was then the Kingdom of Italy. So while many of the palazzo’s original details have been preserved — 19th-century frescoes above the reception desk and in some of the rooms, tall vaulted ceilings in the lounge — the hotel is also liberally decorated with pictures of the bearded patriot’s likeness. As the name suggests, there’s also a conspicuous color theme, evident everywhere from the lobby’s collection of inky-blue vases to the blue-gray walls. Added to the mix is a liberal dash of playfulness in the form of quirky lifelike statues — Batman, a pirate — that are stationed around the hotel. The hotel is on the recently refurbished Piazza Santa Maria Novella, in the city’s historic center. It is approximately midway between the main train station and the Duomo, each about five minutes away by foot. After a dour check-in experience with nary a welcome, my husband and I were brusquely shown to our second-floor room at the end of a mazelike hallway, where I was startled to turn a corner and find myself eye-to-eye with a life-size figure of Spock from “Star Trek.” A key card malfunction later, we finally entered the spacious room, which felt even larger thanks to the bedroom’s extremely high ceiling. The walls were painted a calming blue-gray hue, and the floors were teak parquet. Simple furnishings included a walnut desk, a couple of low stools and a firm double bed with a gray headboard and two bedside tables. The best feature, however, was revealed when a heavy floral drape was pulled aside to reveal the window and a lovely view of the entire piazza including the Basilica di Santa Maria Novella’s exquisite inlaid-marble facade. Small but sufficient for one person at a time, the space had been updated with black-and-white terrazzo flooring, modern fixtures and bright lighting. The shower stall, a cramped box tiled with gray-veined Calacatta marble, had a glass door and rainfall shower head. In addition to bath amenities, there was also a powerful, high-quality blow dryer. There was a meager minibar with cold drinks in the room, but Wi-Fi was fast and free. The lobby lounge, with palm tree sculptures and artworks beneath vaulted ceilings, had ample seating and an array of international publications. A daily breakfast buffet, served in a small atrium, is included in the room rate. The spread had both hot and cold dishes, including warm scrambled eggs, loaves of rustic Tuscan bread, Italian cheeses, prosciutto, and fresh fruit juices like green-apple and a citrusy multivitamin blend. Espresso-based drinks are made to order, but filter coffee was also available. For a fee (5 euros per person), breakfast could be delivered to the room. A mix of intriguing history and quirky design make for an eye-catching hotel, but friendlier service should be added to that equation.

During the Paleocene, the continents continued to drift toward their present positions. Supercontinent Laurasia had not yet separated into three continents. Europe and Greenland were still connected. North America and Asia were still intermittently joined by a land bridge, while Greenland and North America were beginning to separate. The Laramide orogeny of the late Cretaceous continued to uplift the Rocky Mountains in the American west, which ended in the succeeding epoch. South and North America remained separated by equatorial seas (they joined during the Neogene); the components of the former southern supercontinent Gondwana continued to split apart, with Africa, South America, Antarctica and Australia pulling away from each other.

Beth has a key to a warehouse of books? There are innumerable other questions some of which are resolved later in the movie, much later, in fact too late.And on the point of the acre. Horror filmmakers note that large inanimate objects are inherently not scary  and also if they're meant to be an acre big then make them so.There is also a frightening lack of reasonability as Beth (the best performer in the piece, followed by Jefferson  the cop) suddenly appears to be accused of everything under the sun just because she is on \\"medication\\".With the full ten minutes plus of running round the fields looking for the missing child (did he crawl out of the window?

However, his father dies regardless, and having two minds fighting for control over his new powers, Johnny attempts to stay as far away from mankind as possible, hiding out in Eastern Europe (Romania).In the present, a drunken priest named Moreau (Idris Elba) attempts to warn the order of monks residing in a castle that the Devil has sent out forces to retrieve a certain boy and his mother hiding there, despite the head monk's (Anthony Head) reassurances of their safety. At that moment, mercenaries hired by Roarke breach the castle and kill all of the monks except for Moreau, while the mother, Nadya (Violante Placido) and her son Danny escape. Moreau chases after them, as well as the mercenaries. Trying to protect Nadya and her son, Moreau is driven off a cliff before he shoots the mercenaries' tires, delaying them before they can go after Danny and Nadya. He survives, as a tree breaks his fall. Moreau seeks out Johnny, who has been living in isolation in an abandoned village. Johnny initially refuses to help Moreau locate the mother and her son, but after he is promised that Moreau's ancient order can exorcise the curse from his soul, he agrees.Nadya and Danny are found by the mercenaries, who drive their car off the highway and crash it. Their leader, Ray Carrigan (Johnny Whitworth), takes Danny after a struggle and attempts to execute Nadya. Sensing this, Johnny unleashes the Rider (having held it in for some time) and transforms. He arrives just as Carrigan is about to kill Nadya, and kills two of his men. The Rider senses the great evil in Danny and attempts to kill him, but Nadya...

Should I validate this answer? OPT: A. No; B. Yes; The answer is:","output":"A. No. The suggested answer does not provide a clear definition or explanation of what a 2nd or 3rd cousin once removed is, and might be misleading due to the focus on \\"first cousin\\" in the response. A more accurate and detailed answer to the question would be: A 2nd cousin is someone who shares a common great-grandparent with you, but not a grandparent. In other words, their grandparents are siblings to one of your grandparents. A 3rd cousin is one more step removed; you share a common great-great-grandparent with them, but not a great-grandparent. The term \\"once removed\\" refers to the difference in generations between the two relatives. For example, your 2nd cousin's child would be your 2nd cousin once removed because you are one generation apart (the child is the next generation below you). Similarly, a 3rd cousin once removed implies that there is a one-generation difference between you and your 3rd cousin, whether that person is one generation above or below you in the family tree. If your 3rd cousin is one generation above you, that person would be your parent's 3rd cousin. If your 3rd cousin is one generation below you, that person would be the child of one of your 3rd cousins.

Massenet was a prolific composer; he put this down to his way of working, rising early and composing from four o'clock in the morning until midday, a practice he maintained all his life. In general he worked fluently, seldom revising, although Le roi de Lahore, his nearest approach to a traditional grand opera, took him several years to complete to his own satisfaction. It was finished in 1877 and was one of the first new works to be staged at the Palais Garnier, opened two years previously. The opera, with a story taken from the Mahabharata, was an immense success and was quickly taken up by the opera houses of eight Italian cities. It was also performed at the Hungarian State Opera House, the Bavarian State Opera, the Semperoper, Dresden, the Teatro Real in Madrid, and the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in London. After the first Covent Garden performance, The Times summed the piece up in a way that was frequently to be applied to the composer's operas: \\"M. Massenet's opera, although not a work of genius proper, is one of more than common merit, and contains all the elements of at least temporary success.\\"This period was an early high point in Massenet's career. He had been made a chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1876, and in 1878 he was appointed professor of counterpoint, fugue and composition at the Conservatoire under Thomas, who was now the director. In the same year he was elected to the Institut de France, a prestigious honour, rare for a man in his thirties. Camille Saint-Saëns, whom Massenet beat in the election for the vacancy, was resentful at being passed over for a younger composer. When the result of the election was announced, Massenet sent Saint-Saëns a courteous telegram: \\"My dear colleague: the Institut has just committed a great injustice\\". Saint-Saëns cabled back, \\"I quite agree.\\" He was elected three years later, but his relations with Massenet remained cool.Massenet was a popular and respected teacher at the Conservatoire.

Burt Freeman Bacharach ( BAK-@-rak; born May 12, 1928) is an American composer, songwriter, record producer, pianist, and singer who has composed hundreds of popular hit songs from the late 1950s through the 1980s, many in collaboration with popular lyricist Hal David. A six-time Grammy Award winner and three-time Academy Award winner, Bacharach's songs have been recorded by more than 1,000 different artists. As of 2014, he had written 73 US and 52 UK Top 40 hits. He is considered one of the most important composers of 20th-century popular music. In 1998, Bacharach co-wrote and recorded a Grammy-winning album with Elvis Costello, Painted from Memory, on which the compositions began to take on the sound of his earlier work.  In 2003, he teamed with singer Ronald Isley to release the album Here I Am, which revisited a number of his 1960s compositions in Isley's signature R&B style. Bacharach's 2005 solo album At This Time was a departure from past works in that Bacharach penned his own lyrics, some of which dealt with political themes. Guest stars on the album included Elvis Costello, Rufus Wainwright, and hip-hop producer Dr. Dre.  In 2008, Bacharach opened the BBC Electric Proms at The Roundhouse in London, performing with the BBC Concert Orchestra accompanied by guest vocalists Adele, Beth Rowley and Jamie Cullum. The concert was a retrospective look back at his six-decade career. In early 2009, Bacharach worked with Italian soul singer Karima Ammar and produced her debut single Come In Ogni Ora, which became a #4 hit.  In June, 2015, Bacharach performed in the UK at the Glastonbury Festival, and a few weeks later appeared on stage at the Menier Chocolate Factory to launch 'What's It All About? Bacharach Reimagined', a 90-minute live arrangement of his hits.  In 2016, Bacharach, at 88 years old, composed and arranged his first original score in 16 years for the film A Boy Called Po (along with composer Joseph Bauer). The score was released on September 1, 2017. The entire 30-minute score was recorded in just two days at Capitol Studios. The theme song Dancing With Your Shadow, was composed by Bacharach, with lyrics by Billy Mann, and performed by Sheryl Crow. After seeing the film, a true story about a child with Autism, Bacharach decided he wanted to write a score for it, as well as a theme song, in tribute to his daughter Nikki -- who had gone undiagnosed with Asperger syndrome, and who committed suicide at the age of 40.

OPTIONS: 1). Yes. 2). No.","output":"2). No. Eye color is not determined by information found in sEC filings. Eye color in humans is determined by the genetic information contained in an individual's DNA. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the molecule that carries the genetic instructions for the development, functioning, growth, and reproduction of all known living organisms, including humans. It is essentially the blueprint for life. Eye color is a polygenic trait, meaning that multiple genes are involved in determining an individual's eye color. Researchers have identified a few major genes responsible for eye color variation, including OCA2 and HERC2, both located on chromosome 15. These genes, along with others, influence the production of pigments called melanin in the iris of the eye. Melanin is responsible for the color of our skin, hair, and eyes. The amount and type of melanin produced in the eye's iris determine an individual's eye color. Those with more melanin tend to have brown eyes, while those with less melanin will have lighter-colored eyes, such as blue or green. Eye color can range from very dark brown to light blue or even gray, with many shades in between. sEC filings, on the other hand, refer to the documents that publicly traded companies are required to submit to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These filings contain financial statements, disclosures about the company's business operations, risks, and financial condition. They provide investors with information to help them make informed investment decisions. sEC filings have no relation to an individual's eye color or genetic information. In conclusion, eye color is determined by the genetic information found in an individual's DNA, not in sEC filings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. I'm going to say first off that I have given this film a 3 out of 10 after some thought. I was going to give it a straight out 1 but it got a couple extra points for the body count. But that would be about it. Let me explain. I paid literally £1 for this DVD in a supermarket because I tend to have a lot of faith in bargain horror flicks, B-movies especially. But if this film was aiming for B status as I suspect it was for a number of reasons (which I'll touch on in a sec) then it failed magnificently. Not only did it shoot for B and miss, it landed somewhere around F. This film had so many opportunities to be good and it pretty much failed on all accounts. I say above that it's likely this film was aiming for B status and it seems to try and achieve this by trying to blend humour with horror, which can either be very good or very bad. For example, later Freddy films (Dream Warriors onwards) are all about Freddy's style and nose-thumbing, which works out great! But this film completely bombed in that respect because the times where they tried to inject humour were mostly just stupid. I will admit though that towards the beginning of the film the humour was good. In fact, for about half an hour I liked this film and was prepared to congratulate myself on another good find. BUT what really killed this film for me was the inappropriate kills. For instance, when 'Satan' smashes the cat against the board and writes 'boo' with it's blood using its body as a brush. Or when 'Satan' slams the door into the helpless disabled elderly woman. Now I'm not usually too against senseless kills in films-hey, thats the point, right? But in those two cases I just found it grossly offensive and unnecessary to anything in the film-plot especially. For me, the film went downwards from then on. One major bad point about this film is that I hated every character in it. The kid, Dougie was just ridiculously annoying!!! I'm at a loss to explain how he could possibly write off all those bodies and people being killed in front of his eyes as a trick! I mean, come on!!! I completely understand that to be in a horror film a character does have to be somewhat stupid, like running upstairs when you should blatantly be running out of the house screaming for help, but this kid took the biscuit! I wanted to kill him myself by the end of it! It was completely unbelievable and if I had to hear him say 'duh!' one more time I was going to bang my head against a wall-because thats what watching this film felt like. Why didn't i just turn the film off? Mainly because I honestly believe an ending can sometimes redeem a film. But I was wrong in this case. The ending did NOT redeem this film, it further irritated the hell out of me and was inadequate to the plot line. I get it already! The killer is always going to come back dressed as someone else, be welcomed into the house by the stupid kid and go on a killing spree again because no one suspects him in that costume! I GET IT! This film made me physically angry because it was so stupid! And if by some foul mistake you do end up watching this film, watch out for the intestines. Frankly, if that guy actually did have intestines that looked like that, I'd be surprised he wasn't already dead, let alone until someones rips them out and ties them to a chair. In fact, I'll even go so far as to say that the only character I liked at all in this film was actually the killer. Purely because when his 'comedy routine' worked, it did work. All in all, the plot line of this film dragged anything that might have been good down. Why was the killer killing? I don't know. I can live without knowing who he actually was, thats fairly typical, but without some kind of motive - hell i don't know, i'd settle for him having a bad Halloween as a kid! -it just seems more than senseless, just stupid. Stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid. In fact, i hated this film so much that i specifically registered with IMDb just so i could comment on it. Save your money, save your sanity. Stay away from it!

Put on safety goggles and gloves. Using the glass cutter, score around the bottle at your desired candle height. Apply even pressure while rotating the bottle against the cutter. 3. Heat the scored area by rotating the bottle over a candle flame or use boiling water. Alternate between heating and cooling the scored area by using cold water or ice to facilitate the bottle breaking apart at the scored line. 4. Once the bottle has separated, smooth the edges with sandpaper to remove any sharpness. 5. Set up the double boiler by placing the heat-safe container inside the saucepan filled with water. Alternatively, use a double boiler pan if you have one. 6. Add the candle wax to the heat-safe container and heat the water in the saucepan gradually. Monitor the temperature of the wax with a thermometer to avoid overheating. 7. While the wax is melting, prepare the wick by attaching it to the wick holder or clothespin to keep it steady and centered in the bottle. 8. When the wax reaches the optimal melting temperature (usually around 180°F or 82°C), carefully pour the melted wax into the glass bottle. If desired, add dye or fragrance to the wax during the melting process, stirring well to combine. 9. Let the wax cool and solidify in the glass bottle. This may take several hours or overnight. 10.

Its county seat is Waynesburg. Greene County was created on February 9, 1796, from part of Washington County and named for General Nathanael Greene. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Greene County did not exist on February 10, 1796.\\"?","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph above, we cannot conclude that \\"Greene County did not exist on February 10, 1796.\\" In fact, the opposite is true. The paragraph states that Greene County was created on February 9, 1796, from part of Washington County and was named after General Nathanael Greene. Therefore, on February 10, 1796, Greene County would already have been one day old. Greene County, with its county seat in Waynesburg, would have already begun functioning as a separate administrative unit within Pennsylvania, as the creation date was explicitly mentioned to be February 9, 1796. After this date, the population, geographical boundaries, and local governance would have been established under the new county's jurisdiction. The 2010 census reveals that the population of Greene County went on to become 38,686 people. Another important factor that can be gleaned from this paragraph is the significance of the individual for whom the county was named. General Nathanael Greene was a major figure in the American Revolutionary War, serving as the Continental Army's Quartermaster General and second-in-command to General George Washington. Naming the newly created county after him reflects the importance given to the memory of the war and the eventual establishment of the United States as a separate nation. In conclusion, based on the provided paragraph, we can confidently state that Greene County did exist on February 10, 1796, as it was created just a day before on February 9, 1796. The county's establishment marked an expansion of American administrative divisions and its naming paid homage to a significant figure from the Revolutionary War."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Both Robert Duvall and Glenn Close played their roles with such believability, I simply cried. Glenn Close's role as Ruth, showed her wanting to deal with the situation, but she was under the domination of her husband. \\"Let him think about what he did,\\" Robert Duvall's character, Joe, said staunchly. The story depicted a rural family dealing with an accidental death of a son by his brother, called \\"The Stone Boy,\\" meaning he was so distraught and overwhelmed by what he did, he became emotionally paralyzed. Then towards the end when Jason Presson's character, Arnold, let it all out to a stranger, I was so broken hearted for him, that I actually thought of some of the terrible things that I did in my life. I personalized and identified with his character. Frederick Forrest's and Gail Youngs' roles, did NOT add not much to the film. I thought of Frederick Forrest, who played Ruth's antagonistic, womanizing brother, Andy, as a jerk who did nothing to try to help the situation. His wife, Lou, played by Gail Youngs, acted like a crazy-lady smacking Arnold around out of frustration with her own problems without pity and blaming him for her troubles.

Indianapolis started the season going 3-and-out on their first offensive possession of the new year.  The Texans got good field position with a big punt return from Jacoby Jones to set up a 30-yard field goal to give them a 3-0 lead. The offense continued to struggle throughout the first half, getting two first downs on the next drive, however, eventually having to punt.  The Texans continued to show energy on both offense and defense by scoring two more time, a field goal and a touchdown, giving the Texans a 13-0 lead halfway through the second quarter.  The Colts eventually got the offense going late in the second quarter by scoring on a touchdown reception by Reggie Wayne, which broke the lead down to one possession. Adam Vinatieri made a 20-yard field goal at the end of the first half and the Colts went into the half trailing 13-10. The momentum was seemingly shifting to Indianapolis, until Houston took almost eight minutes off the third quarter clock on a 15-play drive, 13 rushes, that resulted in one of Arian Foster's rushing touchdowns on the day to give Houston a 20-10 lead. Peyton Manning and the offense struggled throughout the third quarter with missed opportunities and continued to shoot themselves in the foot with penalties.  With the start of the fourth quarter Houston scored another touchdown and broke the game open.  The Colts would eventually score two touchdowns late in the game, only when there was no chance of a comeback.

The text you provided lists various types of calorimeters but does not discuss the internal pressure of any of them, particularly the bomb calorimeter. To answer your question, the internal pressure of a bomb calorimeter varies depending on the specific experiment being conducted. Bomb calorimeters are designed to withstand high pressures. During a combustion reaction inside a bomb calorimeter, the pressure may increase significantly - reaching up to 30-40 atmospheres or even higher. This increase in pressure is due to the production of gases during the combustion reaction, and it is a crucial reason why bomb calorimeters are built with strong, robust materials to prevent ruptures or leaks. The exact internal pressure depends on factors such as the composition and quantity of the sample being analyzed, as well as the calibration and design of the calorimeter itself."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The rear-most sledge, which had carried the most weight, was well-worn, and they decided to abandon it. The remaining supplies were re-distributed between the remaining two sledges. Most of the important supplies—the tent and most of the food—were stored on the new rear sledge; if they were to lose a sledge down a crevasse, they reasoned, it would be the front, less-vital sledge. As the rear sledge was heavier, the strongest of remaining dogs were assigned to pull it. At the camp they left a small amount of supplies, including the abandoned sledge and a tent cover, without the floor or poles.By noon the next day they had covered 311 miles (501 km) from the Cape Denison hut. Mertz was ahead on skis, breaking trail. Mawson sat on the first sledge; Ninnis walked beside the second. In his diary that night, Mertz recounted: Around 1 pm, I crossed a crevasse, similar to the hundred previous ones we had passed during the last weeks. I cried out \\"crevasse!\\", moved at right angle, and went forward. Around five minutes later, I looked behind. Mawson was following, looking at his sledge in front of him.

Cameron was born in 1954 in Kapuskasing, Ontario, Canada, the son of Shirley (nee Lowe), an artist and nurse, and Phillip Cameron, an electrical engineer. His paternal great-great-great-grandfather emigrated from Balquhidder, Scotland, in 1825. Cameron grew up in Chippawa, Ontario, and attended Stamford Collegiate School in Niagara Falls, Ontario. His family moved to Brea, California in 1971, when Cameron was 17 years old. In June 2005, Cameron was announced to be working on a project tentatively titled \\"Project 880\\" (now known to be Avatar) in parallel with another project, Alita: Battle Angel (an adaptation of the manga series Battle Angel Alita). Both movies were to be shot in 3D. By December, Cameron stated that he wanted to film Battle Angel first, followed by Avatar. However, in February 2006, he switched goals for the two film projects and decided to film Avatar first. He mentioned that if both films were successful, he would be interested in seeing a trilogy being made for both. Alita: Battle Angel eventually began production in 2016 with Cameron writing and producing and Robert Rodriguez directing.  Avatar had an estimated budget of over 300 million and was released on December 18, 2009. This marked his first feature film since 1997's Titanic. It is composed almost entirely of computer-generated animation, using a more-advanced version of the \\"performance capture\\" technique used by director Robert Zemeckis in The Polar Express. James Cameron had written an 80-page scriptment for Avatar in 1995 and announced in 1996 that he would make the film after completing Titanic. In December 2006, Cameron explained that the delay in producing the film since the 1990s had been to wait until the technology necessary to create his project was advanced enough, since at the time no studio would finance for the development of the visual effects. The film was originally scheduled to be released in May 2009 but was pushed back to December 2009 to allow more time for post-production on the complex CGI and to give more time for theatres worldwide to install 3D projectors. Cameron originally intended Avatar to be 3D-only.  Avatar broke several box office records during its initial theatrical run. It grossed 749.7 million in the United States and Canada and more than 2.74 billion worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of all time in the United States and Canada, surpassing Cameron's Titanic. Avatar also became the first movie to ever earn more than 2 billion worldwide. Including revenue from the re-release of Avatar featuring extended footage, it grossed 760.5 million in the United States and Canada and more than 2.78 billion worldwide. It was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, and won three for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography and Best Visual Effects.  Avatar's success made Cameron the highest earner in Hollywood for 2010, netting him 257 million as reported by Vanity Fair.  Disney announced in September 2011 that it would adapt James Cameron's film Avatar into Pandora-The World of Avatar, a themed area at Disney's Animal Kingdom in Lake Buena Vista, Florida.

He channels Colbert, satirically calls his candidacy a threat to our way of life. Obeidallah: Why do media coddle Colbert just because he calls himself a \\"comedian\\" Article:","output":"Title: Stephen Colbert's Potential Presidential Run: Why is the Media So Supportive of a Comedian? Introduction: Comedian Dean Obeidallah recently shared that Stephen Colbert is considering running for president. However, this potential candidacy is being met with mixed reactions. While some view it as a breath of fresh air, Obeidallah, through his satirical portrayal of Colbert, asserts that it could be a threat to our way of life. As the media continues to coddle Colbert simply because he calls himself a \\"comedian,\\" this article aims to explore why such support exists and the potential implications of Colbert's candidature. Body: 1. The appeal of celebrity involvement in politics Stephen Colbert, as a comedian and television host, holds significant sway in the entertainment industry. But why would the media be inclined to support a candidate with no political experience? In recent times, we have witnessed a growing trend of celebrities entering the political arena. This could potentially be due to the widespread influence of media personalities who command a large, devoted following. As the public tends to trust and relate to their favorite figures, celebrities like Colbert tap into this pre-established emotional connection translating it into political support. 2. Colbert's unique perspective as a satirist Colbert is known for his biting wit and satirical comedy, which he has consistently used to critique political figures on his television show. Through this lens, he has developed an understanding of the political landscape that might be valuable in an unconventional way. His candidature, therefore, may shed light on the flaws of the system and bring a fresh perspective to the table. 3. The role of media in shaping public perception It is crucial to examine the role media plays in shaping the public's perception of a potential candidate like Stephen Colbert. By lending support and rallying around a comedian, the media risks oversimplifying the political process. While it is essential for the public to have a diverse pool of candidates representing various backgrounds, the media has a responsibility to question the qualifications of all candidates, no matter their background or occupation. Conclusion: Stephen Colbert's potential presidential run brings to light questions about celebrity involvement in politics and the media's role in shaping public perception. As influential personalities like Colbert consider entering the political arena, it's vital for both the public and the media to scrutinize these figures with the same level of stringency as career politicians. The media's support of Colbert's candidacy should not be accepted uncritically simply because he identifies as a comedian. Instead, careful consideration of qualifications, policy proposals, and the implications of such candidature should be the focus of future analyses."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Today it is the largest city in America. How can the change in its size and importance be explained? To answer this question we must consider certain facts about geography, history, and economics. Together these three will explain the huge growth of America's most famous city. The map of the Northeast shows that the four areas with the largest populations in this region are around seaports. At these points materials from across the sea enter the United States, and the products of the land are sent there for export across the sea. We know that places where transportation lines meet are good places for making raw materials into finished goods. That is why seaports often have cities nearby. But cities like New York needed more than their geographical location in order to become great industrial centers. Their development did not happen simply by chance.www.zxxk.com About 1815, when many Americans from the east had already moved toward the west, transportation routes from the seaports to the central regions of the country began to be a serious problem. The slow wagons of that time, usually drawn by horses, were too expensive for moving heavy freight   very far. In New York State a canal seemed the best answer to the transportation problem. From the eastern end of Lake Erie all the way across the state to the Hudson River there is a long strip of low land. Here the Erie Canal was built, and after several years of work it was completed in 1825. The canal produced an immediate effect. Freight costs were cut to about one tenth of what they had been. New York City, which had been smaller than Philadelphia and Boston, quickly became the leading city of the coast.

He was applying his knowledge of genetic engineering to develop better crops. Recently, he had successfully developed a crop, crop A, that was herbicide tolerant. To determine the versatility of the crop he compared it with another crop that was not tolerant of herbicides, crop B. The results of his research would allow his company to market the new crop.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Would crop A need less or more number of chemicals than crop B?  Hint: In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops.

An object with more mass is pulled by gravity with greater force. Mass and weight are closely related. However, the weight of an object can change if the force of gravity changes. On Earth, the force of gravity is the same everywhere. So how does the force of gravity change? It doesnt if you stay on Earth. What if we travel to another planet or moon in our solar system? Look at the photo of astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. taken by fellow astronaut Neil Armstrong in the Figure. They were the first humans to walk on the moon. An astronaut weighs less on the moon than he would on Earth. This is because the moons gravity is weaker than Earths. The astronauts mass, on the other hand, did not change. He still contained the same amount of matter on the moon as he did on Earth. If the astronaut weighed 175 pounds on Earth, he would have weighed only 29 pounds on the moon. If his mass on Earth was 80 kg, what would his mass have been on the moon?

News article: Scientists Use Big Data to Identify Anonymous Artist Banksy Banksy is a famous artist and activist whose distinctive drawings appear unexpectedly on the buildings of London and New York City. Hailed by some as a genius, and others as a vandal, his aura is enhanced by mystery: He never appears with his art, and he tightly conceals his identity. Now a new study by British scientists at Queen Mary University of London purports to identify Banksy using big data tools and geographical profiling. According to the paper, which appears in the Journal of Spatial Science, it is possible to use “a Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) model of geographic profiling, a mathematical technique developed in criminology…to analyse the spatial patterns of Banksy artworks in Bristol and London.” As The Economist explains, this involved associating Banksy works with corresponding locations: a pub, playing fields, and three residential addresses. All of the locations are tied with one man, Robin Gunningham, meaning it’s possible to conclude with a high degree of certainty that Gunningham is Banksy. This finding is consistent with reports in 2008 that claimed to identify Banksy as Gunningham, who is a painter from Bristol, based on a photograph of the artist with a spray can. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. Banksy became famous for his outdoor stencils, often political in nature, and for acts such as placing a life-size replica of a Guantanamo Bay detainee on a ride at Disneyland. In 2013, he spent the summer in New York, leaving impromptu murals on buildings, earning the ire of the city’s mayor in the process. According to the BBC, lawyers for Banksy approached the Queen Mary University of London with concerns about how the work would be publicized. But they reportedly did not question the validity of the science. The purpose of the study was to use Banksy as a test subject to prove how the DRM model of profiling is a superior mathematical technique for identifying people associated with certain acts. The study claims the technique used to identify Banksy “could be used to help locate terrorist bases before more serious incidents occur.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"This news article is about how scientists used a special math technique called \\"geographical profiling\\" to try and figure out the real identity of Banksy, a famous artist who draws on buildings and keeps their identity a secret.

Answer the following question: Process:  - Bees find a place for the hive, such as a rock crevice or tree branch - Bees gather nectar from flowers - The bees evaporate the nectar by passing it back and forth to each other - The evaporation turns the nectar into sugary honey - The bees chew the honey until it turns into moldable wax - The bees mold the wax into hexagonal (six sided) cylinders - Thousands of these hexagonal cylinders put together form the hive -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the bees mold less wax happens, how will it affect a SMALLER hive.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"If the bees mold less wax, it will directly affect the construction process of a smaller hive. Let's consider the steps and effects involved: 1. Bees molding less wax: This will result in a reduced amount of wax available for hive construction. Bees typically use wax to build the hexagonal cylinders that form the structure of the hive. 2. Hexagonal cylinders construction: With the limited wax material, bees may build fewer hexagonal cylinders, potentially leading to a smaller hive size. 3. Space for honey storage and brood rearing: A smaller hive would have less space for honey storage and brood rearing. This could result in the colony having less food supply to support the population, as well as the future growth of the colony. 4. Resource allocation: Bees may have to prioritize the allocation of limited wax resources, potentially either focusing on honey storage cells or brood cells. This could lead to a compromise between colony growth and food storage and could have indirect effects on the overall health of the colony. Even though the bees might produce less honey if they mold less wax, smaller hives might still be functional, as the perturbation could retain the basic structure and function of the hive. However, the smaller hive size may have both direct and indirect effects on the health and growth of the colony, as well as on supporting the bees' key activities."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Article: LONDON - MPs on Monday debated a petition to ban U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump from Britain over remarks on Muslims, but while describing his comments as “crazy” and “offensive”, most said the ban would go against free speech.      Members of parliament said Trump should be allowed into Britain where his views could be challenged, that a ban would give him more publicity or that it was not for Britain to get involved in U.S. affairs.      Trump caused outrage last month with his comments that Muslims should be banned from entering the United States. He spoke after 14 people died in a shooting spree in California by two Muslims whom the FBI said had been radicalised.      His comments prompted more than half a million Britons to sign a petition calling for him to be barred from entering the country, where he has business interests.      The three-hour debate saw lawmakers from all sides criticise Trump’s comments. While it was not followed by a vote, many more lawmakers spoke against a ban than for it.      “I want to see Donald Trump come to this country ... I want him to get a sense of the fury and the frustration with his xenophobic remarks,” said Gavin Robinson, a lawmaker from Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party.      Only interior minister Theresa May can issue an order banning entry into Britain and Prime Minister David Cameron has said while Trump’s comments were “divisive, unhelpful and wrong”, he does not back the idea of barring him.      Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said the government did not comment on who it was considering for exclusion but said “a frank and open exchange of views” was the most effective way to influence Trump.      “The U.S. remains our most important bilateral partner. It is in the UK’s interests that we engage all presidential candidates, Democratic and Republican, even though we may disagree profoundly on important issues,” he said.      ‘NOT WITHIN 1,000 MILES’      “I believe it is for the American people to hold him to account. It is bad politics ... to intervene in the electoral processes of other countries,” said Conservative lawmaker Tom Tugendhat.      Some spoke passionately in favour of banning Trump however, saying he should not be treated differently from others who have been banned for similar views.      “Just think what would happen in the current climate if he came ... and preached that message of divisive hate,” said Jack Dromey, an opposition Labour Party spokesman on home affairs.      Slideshow (3 Images)      “To have someone come to our shores who demonises all of the Muslim community would be fundamentally wrong and would undermine the safety and security of our citizens and that is not a risk I am prepared to take ... I don’t think Donald Trump should be allowed within a 1,000 miles of our shore.”      Trump has threatened to cancel over 700 million pounds of planned investments in golf courses in Scotland if he is banned.      Trump International Golf Links in Scotland said in a statement: “It is absurd that valuable parliamentary time is being wasted debating a matter raised as part of the American presidential election.” ||||| MPs are to debate calls for the US presidential candidate Donald Trump to be banned from the UK following his controversial comments about Muslims, after more than half a million people signed a petition.            The government signalled last month that it would not refuse Trump entry after he was widely criticised for saying that Muslims should be banned from entering the US.      However, the call for the sanction to be imposed on the businessman will now at least have a hearing in parliament after the House of Commons petitions committee announced on Tuesday that it was scheduling a session in Westminster Hall on 18 January.      More than 560,000 people have signed the petition demanding the billionaire businessman be barred. Politicians will also discuss a separate petition opposing such a ban, even though it only gained about 40,000 signatures – well below the 100,000 threshold for triggering a debate.      Trump, who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination in the US, faced an international backlash last month after urging a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on”.      Woman behind petition to ban Donald Trump from UK ‘shocked’ by support Read more      Justifying his comments, he claimed there were “places in London and other places that are so radicalised that police are afraid for their own lives”. There was no immediate response on Tuesday from Trump or his campaign to the news that the debate was to go ahead.      The prime minister, David Cameron, has condemned the remarks as “divisive, stupid and wrong” but made clear he did not support banning Trump.      The debate later this month will be led by the Labour MP Paul Flynn, a member of the committee. Its chairwoman, Helen Jones, said: “By scheduling a debate on these petitions, the committee is not expressing a view on whether or not the government should exclude Donald Trump from the UK. As with any decision to schedule a petition for debate, it simply means that the committee has decided that the subject should be debated. A debate will allow a range of views to be expressed.” ||||| For good reasons the Government does not routinely comment on individual immigration and exclusion decisions.      The Home Secretary may exclude a non-European Economic Area national from the UK if she considers their presence in the UK to be non-conducive to the public good.      The Home Secretary has said that coming to the UK is a privilege and not a right and she will continue to use the powers available to prevent from entering the UK those who seek to harm our society and who do not share our basic values.      Exclusion powers are very serious and are not used lightly. The Home Secretary will use these powers when justified and based on all available evidence.      The Prime Minister has made clear that he completely disagrees with Donald Trump’s remarks. The Home Secretary has said that Donald Trump’s remarks in relation to Muslims are divisive, unhelpful and wrong.

What Cameron thinks      Image copyright AP      In a rare intervention in US politics, Prime Minister David Cameron labelled Trump's comments \\"stupid and wrong\\" but said he did not support a ban, saying the tycoon would \\"unite us all against him\\" if he visited the UK.      Could Monday's debate change Cameron's mind?      Image caption MPs take part in an earlier Westminster Hall debate      It's unlikely. The three-hour debate is not taking place in the Commons chamber - the place where British laws are made - but in a side chamber, Westminster Hall, and there will not be a vote at the end of it.      A ban would be 'counterproductive'      Paul Flynn, pictured, the veteran Labour MP who is proposing Monday's motion, says he does not want to see Trump banned from the UK as it would hand the Republican candidate a publicity coup. More than 40,000 people have signed a counter-petition, arguing that it would be \\"totally illogical\\" to ban Trump, which will also be debated by the MPs.      \\"Let me take you by the hand...\\"      Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Brixton, in south London, would be on Flynn's itinerary      Taking his cue from the folk song Streets of London, Paul Flynn says he would like to take Mr Trump by the hand and show him what Britain is like. He told BBC News: \\"I would invite him to show me where the no-go areas are in Britain and have a discussion about why in the UK we have fewer gun shot deaths per year than America has per day. Perhaps we can have a stroll down to Brixton to have a look at the racial harmony there.\\"      British lefties lecturing the Americans      \\"If we are seen as a group of left-wingers opposing Trump it could have the reverse effect to the one the petitioners want,\\" says Flynn. He says he wants to avoid interfering in US politics and will stress that country's proud tradition of free speech.      So what's the point of the debate?      Paul Flynn says he wants to give a voice to the petitioners' anger. There will be MPs who disagree with Mr Flynn, insisting a ban is necessary, and possibly some who will support his views.      Salmond v Trump      Image copyright Reuters      The big question for many on Monday, is will Alex Salmond put in an appearance? The former SNP leader has had a long-running spat with Trump, who recently called him \\"an embarrassment to Scotland\\". Trump is proud of his Scottish ancestry but his investments in Aberdeenshire and ownership of the Turnberry golf resort have created controversy.      He was stripped of his status as a business ambassador for Scotland by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon after his Muslim comments.      Speaking on Sunday, Mr Salmond said he personally backed a ban, telling the BBC: \\"My view is that, yes, I would probably ban \\"The Donald\\" because it would do him some good. He wants to ban all Muslims from the US. I want to ban all Donald Trumps from Scotland.\\"      Image copyright AFP      The last word?      MP Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh will be speaking for the Scottish National Party in Monday's debate. But don't bet against Salmond having a say also. |||||Summary:","output":"A petition which was recently debated in UK parliament called for a ban on US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump from entering the UK over his recent remarks on Muslims. In results from the debate, Members of Parliament stated that he should be allowed into the country so that his views could be challenged and that a ban would give Trump even more publicity. Prime Minister David Cameron also added that while he agrees Trump's comments were \\"divisive, unhelpful and wrong,\\" he does not back the idea of barring him from entering the UK."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Years later, Kaunitz kept trying to establish France's alliance with Austria. He tried as hard as he could for Austria to not get entangled in Hanover's political affairs, and was even willing to trade Austrian Netherlands for France's aid in recapturing Silesia. Frustrated by this decision and by the Dutch Republic's insistence on neutrality, Britain soon turned to Russia. On September 30, 1755, Britain pledged financial aid to Russia in order to station 50,000 troops on the Livonian-Lithunian border, so they could defend Britain's interests in Hanover immediately. Besthuzev, assuming the preparation was directed against Prussia, was more than happy to obey the request of the British. Unbeknownst to the other powers, King George II also made overtures to the Prussian king; Frederick, who began fearing the Austro-Russian intentions, and was excited to welcome a rapprochement with Britain. On January 16, 1756, the Convention of Westminster was signed wherein Britain and Prussia promised to aid one another in order to achieve lasting peace and stability in Europe.

They convey information about two different subjects and scenarios. The first sentence describes a girl wearing a pink sweater and green dress walking down a path. In this sentence, the emphasis is on the girl and her attire while on a path. The detail provided about her clothing helps to create a vivid mental image for the reader. The second sentence, \\"The boy is walking through the muddy path.\\", focuses on a boy and the muddy path he is walking through. The two subjects are distinct, as the first one involves a girl, and the second involves a boy. Moreover, the fact that the path is muddy in the second sentence introduces a new element that isn't present in the first sentence. To determine if the second sentence is a \\"true sentence,\\" we would need a context to compare the two sentences or more information from which we can derive a relationship between the subjects. As they stand, the two sentences are simply communicating different scenes involving different individuals and different conditions of the path. In conclusion, the second sentence cannot be automatically deemed \\"true\\" or \\"false\\" based solely on the information provided in the first sentence, as they do not have a direct link or relationship.

She is a bright yet introverted woman with a deep admiration for exotic birds. Joan has a particular obsession with a rare Amazonian bird species that is on the brink of extinction. When she finds out there could be a few of these species left in the wild, Joan decides to embark on a dangerous mission to the Amazon Rainforest, hoping to save them. She delves into this voyage, however, little does she know about the threats that lurk in this mysterious forest. Zolo, a ruthless and cunning poacher known across South America for decimating wild bird populations to sell in illicit markets, hears about Joan and her expedition. He plans to capture these rare birds before Joan can reach them, endangering both the species and Joan's life in the process. On her journey, Joan fortuitously meets Jack T. Colton, an edgy, charismatic American who used to be an infamous exotic bird smuggler. Having abandoned his old ways due to a newfound respect for wildlife, Jack now uses his insider knowledge about the illicit trade and his adventurous skills to protect endangered bird species. Despite their contrasting personalities – Joan, the reserved and intellectual scientist, and Jack, the daring and street-smart adventurer – they form an unlikely alliance. Jack, sensing danger from his old contacts in the smuggling world and having had a previous brush with Zolo, commits to protecting Joan and her mission. As they delve deeper into the rainforest, the tension escalates. Zolo and his mercenaries attempt to ambush Joan and Jack several times, leading to action-packed chases through the dense jungle, daring river crossings, and nail-biting encounters with the forest's dangerous fauna. In these trials, Joan discovers untapped courage amidst fear, and Jack reconnects with his humane side. In the climax, Zolo finally manages to corner Joan and Jack but underestimates their determination to save the rare birds and each other. They devise a clever plan using the birds, the forest's natural elements and Jack's savvy knowledge about poachers' tactics. They manage to escape from Zolo's clutches, sabotage his operation and save the last pair of the rare birds. The movie ends with the authorities, alerted by Jack, descending on Zolo's operations and arresting him. Joan and Jack, having formed a profound bond, part ways - Joan returns to New York City with her mission accomplished, and Jack vanishes into the Amazon, continuing his quest to protect its wildlife. Feathered Haven is an edge-of-the-seat, action-packed adventure filled with intrigue, unexpected camaraderie, and an underlying message on wildlife preservation. Joan's determination and Jack's transformation underline the assertion that it's not just about saving a species but also about our responsibility towards nature."},{"instruction":"OPT:  (A).

How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of cutting cushion foam for a couch cushion, follow these steps: 1. Gather the necessary materials and tools:    a. Cushion foam: The preferred foam type is usually high-density polyurethane foam, as it is durable and maintains its shape over time.    b. Measuring tape or ruler    c. Marker or pen    d. Sharp knife or electric carving knife: A serrated knife works well, but using an electric knife offers greater precision and a cleaner cut.    e. Cutting surface: Choose a clean and safe surface, such as a workbench or a large table protected with a self-healing mat or thick cardboard.    f. Straight edge or T-square: This will help you draw straight lines and maintain consistent dimensions.    g. Optional: Spray adhesive or batting if you want to wrap the foam in fabric before inserting it into the cushio 2. Measure the cushion dimensions:    a. Remove the existing cushion if needed and use it as a template for the new foam. Alternatively, measure the couch cushion's length, width, and depth. Be sure to measure the interior space of the cushion cover so that the foam fits precisely.    b. Add approximately 1/3 of an inch (1 cm) to each dimension to account for a snug fit that will maintain the fullness of the cushion. 3. Mark the foam:    a. Lay the foam on the cutting surface, ensuring it is flat and does not have any creases or folds. If you are using the existing cushion as a template, place it on top of the foam and trace around it with a marker or pen.    b. If you are using the measured dimensions, draw the length and width lines using a straight edge or T-square and a marker or pen. Be sure to make the lines bold and easy to see. 4. Cut the foam:    a. Start at one of the corners, align the knife with the marked lines, and begin cutting. Be sure to hold the knife at a vertical angle to make clean, straight cuts. Work slowly and carefully to avoid cutting too far or making sloppy cuts.    b. If using an electric carving knife, turn on the knife and press the blade gently into the foam. Again, make sure to hold the knife vertically. Follow the marked lines, applying even pressure for a smooth and precise cut.    c. Rotate the foam as needed in order to access all sides and maintain control throughout the cutting process. 5. Check the fit:    a. Test the fit of the cut foam in the cushion cover or the couch cushion space. It should fit snugly but not be too compressed.     b. Make any necessary adjustments or trims to the foam to ensure an accurate fit. 6. Optional - Wrap the foam in fabric or batting:    a. If you prefer a softer feel and a smoother look, consider wrapping the cut foam in batting or fabric. Cut the material to size, ensuring it covers the entire foam.    b. Use spray adhesive to attach the fabric or batting to the foam, following the adhesive manufacturer’s instructions on how to apply it. Do this in a well-ventilated area and allow the adhesive to dry as directed. 7. Insert the foam cushion into the cushion cover or place it directly onto the couch frame, depending on the cushion design.

Choose your story that continues the following story. Although Natalie 's new boyfriend seemed like a catch, Christine objected, since  Choose your answer from: (a). Natalie tended to have good judgement in mates.; (b). Christine tended to have good judgement in mates.;","output":"(b). Christine tended to have good judgement in mates. Natalie had always admired Christine's ability to accurately identify people's intentions and character. Christine often had an uncanny ability to discern a person's true nature and predict how they would behave in relationships - a skill that Natalie did not possess herself. Although Natalie wanted to believe that her new boyfriend was a catch, she could not overlook Christine's objection. It was Christine, after all, who had saved her from a series of potentially disastrous relationships in the past.  Their friendship had a long history, and it was Christine who had been there to help Natalie learn to read warning signs and avoid dangerous situations. Over the years, Natalie had grown more reliant on Christine's insights into potential partners. However, this time her new boyfriend, Ethan, was different - at least in Natalie's eyes. He was charming, kind, and intelligent, making it hard for Natalie to understand Christine's concerns about him. Christine had been observing Ethan closely since he and Natalie started dating, and she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off about him. While everyone else seemed smitten by his charm and good looks, Christine felt ill at ease whenever Ethan was around. Her gut told her that Ethan was too good to be true. Despite her best efforts, she couldn't find anything concrete to back up her suspicions, yet she insisted on sharing her concerns with Natalie. Natalie wanted to believe that Ethan was different, so she confronted Christine and asked her to articulate her concerns. \\"It's just a bad feeling I have, Nat,\\" Christine admitted, struggling to put her feelings into words. \\"I know it's not much to go on, but I've never steered you wrong before. I just think you need to be careful.\\" Natalie nodded, considering Christine's words. She knew that her friend had always had her best interests at heart, and she had to acknowledge that her own past relationships hadn't exactly been models of healthy partnership. However, it was difficult for her to accept that Ethan could be anything other than the warm, loving, and attentive person he appeared to be. Reluctantly, Natalie agreed to be more cautious – at least until she could prove Christine's doubts to be unfounded. Over the following weeks, she began to watch Ethan more closely, observing his interactions with her friends and family and paying attention to any red flags that might confirm Christine's suspicions.  As time passed, however, Natalie remained charmed by Ethan, and she couldn't help but feel that Christine's concerns were unjustified. To her surprise, though, tensions between Christine and Ethan seemed to reach a breaking point when Christine confronted him during a heated discussion about an issue on which they disagreed. \\"Look, Ethan,\\" Christine said, her voice shaking with emotion. \\"I want what's best for my friend, and I don't trust you. If you truly love Natalie, you'll prove me wrong.\\" Ethan's calm, measured response took everyone by surprise. \\"Christine, I understand your concern,\\" he said gently, meeting her gaze without a hint of resentment. \\"You've seen her hurt before, and you want to protect her. But I care deeply for Natalie, and I would never intentionally harm her. Instead of seeing us as adversaries, can we come together as people who both want to see Natalie happy and respected? Perhaps, then, we'll realize we are on the same team.\\" Christine hesitated for a moment, taking in his words. A part of her, deep down, knew that Ethan might be sincere. Slowly, she nodded, determining that for Natalie's sake, she would give him the benefit of the doubt. Over the next few months, she continued to watch Ethan closely, waiting for any indication that her initial mistrust was warranted.  As it turned out, Christine's initial suspicions never manifested into anything concrete. Instead, what began as cautious acceptance eventually transformed into a genuine friendship between Christine and Ethan, as they both grew to trust and respect one another. Natalie appreciated the growth between her best friend and her partner and was relieved that her love life was finally headed toward a healthy and happy path, thanks to the unyielding bond between her and Christine, who always had her back."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the baby bird died happens, how will it affect MORE birds.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the perturbation of the baby bird dying has both direct and indirect effects on the process.  Direct Effects: 1. The mother bird loses her offspring, which means that there is one less bird to grow, reproduce, and contribute to the population. 2. The energy and resources invested by the mother bird in laying the egg, incubating, and caring for the baby bird are wasted. Indirect Effects: 1. A decrease in bird population could lead to a potential imbalance in the local ecosystem. Birds contribute to seed dispersal, pollination, and controlling insect populations. This could have a domino effect on other animal and plant species in the ecosystem. 2. If many baby birds die within a particular species, it could lead to a decrease in overall genetic diversity. This could make the species more vulnerable to diseases, environmental changes, and other factors that could threaten their survival. 3. Predators that rely on birds as a food source may also be affected by a decrease in bird populations. This could, in turn, lead to a negative impact on the predators' populations.

The defendants in a father-son prostitution case were acquitted of sex trafficking Wednesday but found guilty of laundering millions of dollars and of promoting prostitution, leading at least one of their 'happy hookers' to weep for her pimps. Three self-described prostitutes took the stand as character witnesses during the trial, all of whom described Vincent George Sr. and Vincent George Jr, their admitted pimps, as caring men who took good care of them. The verdict means the two men, though cleared of charges they coerced the women into their sex business, could face up to 15 years for laundering millions of dollars through music recording and car service businesses. Desiree Ellis, a prostitute who testified that she and Vincent George Sr. would fight but then make up--and even called him a 'teddy bear' on the stand--was seen being comforted after the mixed verdict had been read. Torn: A friend comforts Desiree Williams, one of the 'happy hookers' who testified the father-son pimp duo took excellent care of her, after a mixed verdict was read Wednesday. 'Happy hookers': Self-proclaimed prostitutes Danielle Geissler (left), Heather Keith (center) and Desiree Ellis (right) have testified in defense of their alleged pimps, a father-and-son duo. The men's supporters in the courtroom initially cheered the verdict, but the gallery fell silent when Manhattan Judge Ruth Pickholtz announced convictions against the Georges. The pair showed no emotion aside from slight smiles as they were led back to jail in handcuffs. The father and son had faced up to 25-year terms on the sex-trafficking charges. Despite the mixed verdict, District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. called the outcome a victory. 'The goal of the prosecution was to dismantle a criminal enterprise from top to bottom,' he said. 'That goal has been achieved with the Georges. ... There is no fairy tale ending for these defendants.' Family affair: Father and son pimps Vincent George, Sr. and Jr. were acquitted on sex trafficking charges but found guilt of laundering millions of dollars and of promoting prostitution. Mixed victory: Howard Greenberg, pictured, defense lawyer for the father and son pimps and attorney David Epstein called the mixed verdict a victory. Defense attorneys - who called the. women working for their clients 'happy hookers' - also claimed victory,. adding that they planned to appeal the convictions. The verdict 'recognizes that people. have free will and the right to make choices whether or not you like. those choices,' David Epstein, the son's attorney, said of the. prostitutes. The loving relationship between pimps. and prostitutes 'was vindicated,' Epstein added. 'It's a moral victory. as well as a legal one.' Still in trouble: The pimp duo now faces up to 15 years in prison for money laundering. No complaints: Desiree Ellis is one of three self-proclaimed prostitutes who testified for Vincent Sr and his son George Vincent Jr. She called Vincent Sr. a 'teddy bear.' After Wednesday's verdict, she was seen being comforted. Home is where the pimp is: Desiree Ellis shows a picture of what she says is her house in Allentown, PA, a home she shares with the Georges and some of the other girls. Prosecutors had alleged the. prostitutes made as much as 500,000 a year for the Georges but got only. a few dollars a night themselves and had no bank accounts or property. They were threatened with beatings when they didn't bring in as much. money as expected or were late to check in, according to wiretap. conversations played at trial. 'Bring me my (expletive) money right now and get your ass back to work,' the son said to one woman. The women painted a different. picture, saying they were treated to nice cars, vacations in Florida and. affection from their pimps. Some lived together as 'family' in a house. in Allentown, Pa., about 90 miles from New York, and drove in to the. city at night to turn tricks for 300 a night, they said. One witness, Heather Keith, has. Vincent George Jr.'s nickname, King Koby, tattooed on her neck. She. testified she was a drug-addicted 19-year-old stripper from upstate. He. moved her to Allentown and helped her beat a cocaine habit, she said. Witness: Danielle Geissler, 31, strode into the Manhattan courtroom to take the stand last Tuesday in the trial of the father of her child, who also doubles as her pimp. Keeping it classy: Geissler, dressed in a conservative tan pantsuit accessorized with a large cross dangling from her neck, described Vincent George Jr as her sweetheart and 'daddy,' and said that she was in love with him. 'I would say that I make my own choices,' said Keith, now 26. 'I am not a dumb person. I know what I'm doing.' Another witness, 24-year-old Desiree. Ellis, dismissed allegations that Vincent George Jr. abused her, calling. him a 'teddy bear.' She once thought about leaving him. But once at a bus station, she changed her mind and asked if she could. come back to their 'family.' He welcomed her with open arms. 'We kissed,' she said. 'We made up. We had a love session.' Carrying on: Heather Keith, who is eight months pregnant with another man's child, also defended the two men for whom she worked. Marked woman: Keith has a tattoo with George Jr's street name, 'King Kobe,' which the prosecutors suggested was a sign that she was the pimp's property.George Jr has now been cleared of sex trafficking charges. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"A father and son had a trial because they were accused of forcing women to work as prostitutes and taking their money. The women they worked with said the father and son were actually nice to them and helped them. The judge decided they didn't force the women to work as prostitutes, but they did do some wrong things with money. The father and son might have to spend up to15 years in a place called prison, where people go when they do bad things.

Tweet: GOD! spareeee meeee from this insanityyyyy  Predict the sentiment of this tweet.","output":"Predicting the sentiment of a tweet involves analyzing the language and context in order to determine the underlying emotion being expressed. In this case, the tweet reads: \\"GOD! spareeee meeee from this insanityyyyy.\\" Upon initial examination, it appears that the sentiment of the tweet is negative. This can be inferred from the use of words and the style of writing, as well as the context. Let's break down these elements more thoroughly: 1. Use of words: The words \\"spare\\" and \\"insanity\\" carry negative connotations, as they suggest that the person is overwhelmed or cannot cope with the current situation. The word \\"spare\\" can be interpreted as asking for relief or wanting to be saved from something unpleasant, while \\"insanity\\" suggests that the situation is chaotic or extremely difficult to endure. 2. Style of writing: The elongated vowels in \\"spareeee,\\" \\"meeee,\\" and \\"insanityyyyy\\" emphasize the emotional intensity of the tweet. Repetition of the vowels in this manner conveys a sense of urgency, frustration, or distress. The use of all capital letters in \\"GOD\\" adds an additional layer of emphasis, further highlighting the negative sentiment. 3. Context: While the specific context is not provided in the tweet, it is clear that the speaker is feeling overwhelmed or frustrated by a situation they are facing. This is evident through their plea for help or relief, asking for divine intervention. The term \\"insanity\\" hints that the situation may be chaotic or emotionally draining, further intensifying the negative sentiment. Taking all of these factors into consideration, it is evident that the sentiment of the tweet is negative. The tweet conveys a sense of being overwhelmed, frustrated, and desperate for relief from a challenging or chaotic situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The Change.org petition, which was started just a week ago, has merited nearly 20,000 signatures from supporters who think Blanton should stay behind bars.

I think that’s an important part of parole consideration, and it’s completely lacking in this case.”      The four girls killed in the blast on September 15, 1963 are Addie Mae Collins, 14; Cynthia Wesley, 14; Carole Robertson, 14; and Carol Denise McNair, 11. Blanton is the last surviving Klansmen who was tried for the bombing. ||||| This undated file photo shows Alabama inmate Thomas Edwin Blanton Jr., a one-time Ku Klux Klansman convicted in the 1963 church bombing that killed four black girls in Birmingham, Ala. Alabama's parole... (Associated Press)      BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — Thomas Edwin Blanton Jr. was a young Ku Klux Klansman with a reputation for hating blacks in 1963, when a bomb ripped a hole in the side of 16th Street Baptist Church, killing four black girls during the civil rights movement.      Today, Blanton is old and imprisoned, the last survivor among three one-time KKK members convicted of murder in the bombing. Soon, Alabama's parole board will decide whether Blanton deserves to be free after serving 15 years of a life term for murder.      The board has scheduled a hearing for Wednesday to consider parole for the 78-year-old Blanton. Inmates are not allowed to attend parole hearings in Alabama, but opponents of Blanton's release are expected to address the three-person board when it meets in Montgomery.      The president of the Alabama NAACP, Bernard Simelton, said releasing Blanton at a time when protests are occurring nationwide over police killings of black people would send a horrible message. NAACP chapters statewide are sending letters in opposition to Blanton's release, and the Birmingham chapter is sending a busload of people to oppose parole, he said.      \\"It would be a slap in the face to those young ladies and their families to release him,\\" Simelton said.      Blanton was convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment in 2001 for being part of a group of Klansmen who planted a dynamite bomb that exploded outside 16th Street Baptist on Sept. 15, 1963. The blast killed 11-year-old Denise McNair and 14-year-olds Addie Mae Collins, Carole Robertson and Cynthia Morris, also known as Cynthia Wesley.      The girls, who were inside the church preparing for worship, died instantly in a hail of bricks and stone that seriously injured Collins' sister, Sarah Collins Rudolph. Their deaths inside a church on a Sunday morning became a symbol worldwide of the depth of racial hatred in the segregated South.      Doug Jones, a former U.S. attorney who prosecuted Blanton on the state charge, said Blanton shouldn't be released since he has never accepted responsibility for the bombing or expressed any remorse for a crime that was aimed at maintaining racial separation at a time Birmingham's public schools were facing a court order to desegregate.      \\"This was, as I said during the trial, an act of terrorism before the word 'terrorism' was part of our everyday lives,\\" Jones said.      Jones plans to attend the hearing in opposition to Blanton's early release, and so do several relatives of the girls and the current pastor of 16th Street Baptist, the Rev. Arthur Price. The crowd will include Rudolph, who survived injuries including the loss of an eye and testified against Blanton at his trial.      \\"I'll be there. I'm not saying what I will say until then,\\" said Rudolph.      Long a suspect in the case, Blanton was the second of three people convicted in the bombing. Robert Chambliss, convicted in 1977, and Bobby Frank Cherry, who was convicted in the bombing in 2002, both died in prison.      Blanton and Cherry were indicted in 2000 after the FBI reopened an investigation of the bombing. Evidence against Blanton included secret recordings that were made using FBI bugs at his home and in the car of a fellow Klansman turned informant.      While board members could consider Blanton's advanced age in deciding whether to grant parole, Jones said that shouldn't be a factor.      \\"It took (38) years for him to be brought to justice to begin with,\\" Jones said. \\"I think that mitigates against the fact that he is an elderly man now.\\" ||||| \\"I think it would be a travesty of justice if he were paroled\\" - Metro Birmingham NAACP president Hezekiah Jackson      A crowd will be waiting for the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles when it meets next week to consider the parole of Thomas Blanton, the Klansman convicted in the murders of four little girls in the 1963 bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham.      Family and friends of the four girls, prosecutors, civil rights groups, and others, all who oppose Blanton's release, plan to be at the hearing in Montgomery. The board also has a number of letters and petitions seeking to keep Blanton behind bars to weigh in its decision.      Like other inmates who seek parole, the 78-year-old Blanton will not be at the hearing, a parole board official said. Blanton is serving four life sentences at the St. Clair Correctional Facility.      \\"I think it would be a travesty of justice if he were paroled,\\" said Hezekiah Jackson IV, President of the Metro Birmingham NAACP.      \\"I think it would send a terrible message to the greater community if he (Blanton) were paroled,\\" Jackson said. \\"I think the place he is now is the place he should remain.\\"      The Metro Birmingham NAACP is sponsoring a \\"Justice Matters\\" bus trip to bring people to the board hearing in Montgomery. The bus will load at the NAACP Office, 1520 4th Ave. North in Birmingham, at 5:30 a.m. Wednesday.      To register for the bus, which is first come, first serve, call the NAACP office at 714-5860.      The hearing begins at 8 a.m. Wednesday and should be the first, or among the first, paroles to be considered that day, a parole board official said. The board is expected to announce its decision that day.      A twist in the process came Friday.      Instead of its usual three members, however, the board will only have two members - Cliff Walker, the current Chairman, and Eddie Cook, Jr. William W. Wynne, Jr. is retiring effective August 1 leaving a vacancy.      Parole board officials had hoped to have a new person in place by the time Wynne left.      But when Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley on Friday appointed Tuscaloosa County District Attorney Lyn Head to the board, he didn't make it effective until Sept. 6, said Yasamie August, the governor's press secretary.      A tie vote with two members voting is considered a \\"no\\" vote.      But most people don't think it would come to a tie vote anyway with Blanton.      \\"He committed a heinous crime against innocent children,\\" said Binnie G. Myles, local talk show host and volunteer with the Birmingham Metro Chapter of the NAACP. \\"What message are we sending if he gets out – that these children didn't matter and the church didn't matter?\\"      Addie Mae Collins, Cynthia Wesley, Carole Robertson and Carol Denise McNair were killed in the dynamite blast that happened on that Sunday morning – Sept. 15, 1963 - at the church.                  It is Blanton's first crack at parole since his 2001 conviction for his role in the bombing. Blanton is the last surviving Klansman who was tried or suspected in the bombing.      No one was arrested in the bombing for years, until federal and state prosecutors revived investigations. Robert Chambliss was convicted in 1977. Bobby Frank Cherry was convicted in 2002. Both Chambliss and Cherry died in prison.      A fourth suspect in the bombing, Herman Cash, died in 1994 without ever being charged.      The Metro NAACP chapter held a press conference Friday morning at the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute - across the street from the church - to talk about next week's parole hearing.      \\"No Earthly parole for Mr. Blanton,\\" Jackson said.      Jackson said paroling Blanton would send the wrong message during a time of racial tensions and the justice system.      Bishop Calvin Woods, president of Birmingham chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, said that he was \\"appalled\\" when he heard that Blanton was getting a parole hearing. For 39 years Blanton walked free after the bombing, he said.      Another man who spoke encouraging the denial of parole for Blanton was 79-year-old Harvey Henley. He said he was at home about five miles away from downtown Birmingham getting ready to go to church on the morning of Sept. 16, 1963 when he felt the explosion. \\"It felt like a mini earthquake,\\" he said.      \\"I don't believe in the death penalty but he (Blanton) should stay in jail the rest of his life,\\" Henley said.      Doug Jones, the former U.S. Attorney who prosecuted Blanton, is among those who has predicted the parole board meeting likely won't turn out well for Blanton, especially since Blanton hasn't shown any remorse or acceptance of responsibility.      Jones plans to be at the hearing. Jefferson County District Attorney Brandon Falls said he too will be there. So will officials with the group Victims of Crime and Leniency. The sisters of Denise McNair also are expected at the hearing, Jones said.      Sarah Collins Rudolph, who was injured in the blast and whose sister Addie Mae Collins was killed, has said she will be going to the parole hearing and has also written a letter to the board.      Dianne Braddock, Robertson's older sister, is among those who have sent letters to the parole board. It reads, in part:      I write to you in great shock, sorrow and concern regarding the letter you sent me dated June 22, 2016. ... It is incomprehensible and unfathomable that the State of Alabama is contemplating the release of the man who was convicted on four counts of murder for the lives of Addie Mae Collins, Cynthia Wesley, Denise McNair, and my baby sister, Carole Rosamond Robertson, when he has served a mere fifteen years toward his life sentence. ... With all due respect for the gravity and momentousness of this decision, I submit that it would be a travesty of justice to release Blanton from prison and exonerate him from completing his sentence. Accordingly, I adamantly oppose his parole.      Besides those wishing to speak, the parole board also will have a number of letters to consider. The parole board, however, said they can't release any letters they have received either for or against parole.      There also are at least two on-line petitions seeking to keep Blanton in prison.      One of those was created by a Colorado woman, Mavis Austin, on Change.org. As of Thursday night that petition had more than 54,000 supporters.      Block Parole Inc., a non-profit group based in Ohio, on July 24 also created an online petition in which individuals' comments will be relayed to the Alabama parole board. All information will be kept strictly confidential and will only be available to the victims and their families and The Alabama Parole Board, according to the website.      Bret Vinocur, the Ohio man who founded Block Parole Inc., told AL.com that Blanton parole is one of the few cases the website has highlighted outside of Ohio.      Those petitions, however, may not be considered by the parole board.      \\"The Board does not independently research public petitions or protests that are not actually presented to them at the hearing or included in the file because they are sent to the Board,\\" Meridith Barnes, counsel for the parole board, said Friday. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"The subject of discussion is the potential parole of Thomas E. Blanton Jr., a former member of the Ku Klux Klan, who was involved in the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama in 1963, resulting in the deaths of four young girls. Blanton was convicted of the crime in 2001, receiving four life sentences. However, Alabama law allows the possibility of parole after serving 15 years.  As his parole hearing approached on August 3, a petition was started by Mavis Austin from Wheat Ridge Co., aiming to prevent Blanton's parole and keep him imprisoned. The petition, registered on Change.org, argues that 15 years of imprisonment is inadequate punishment for the hate crime that robbed four girls of their lives. Although started only a week prior to the parole hearing, the petition garnered nearly 20,000 signatures from supporters who believe that Blanton should not be released. Prominent personalities like former U.S. attorney Doug Jones, who initially prosecuted Blanton, strongly denounce his potential parole. Jones notes Blanton's lack of remorse and responsibility for his crimes, which he considers necessary prerequisites for parole consideration.  Public sentiment appears similarly opposed to Blanton's release. Bernard Simelton, president of the Alabama NAACP, stated that releasing Blanton amidst the nationwide racial tensions following police killings of black individuals would send a terrible message, showing disregard for the victims of the bombing and further inflaming racial tensions. Therefore, the NAACP chapters across Alabama are protesting Blanton's release by sending letters of opposition. In addition, the Birmingham chapter is organizing a group of people to publicly oppose the parole. Support for the opposition also comes from other significant figures such as Harvey Henley, who experienced the detonation and Bishop Calvin Woods, president of the Birmingham chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Jefferson County District Attorney Brandon Falls, and officials from the group Victims of Crime and Leniency also expressed their disapproval for Blanton's parole. Interestingly, despite thousands signing the online petitions against Blanton's parole, the petitions may not be considered as the parole board does not independently research public petitions or protests unless they are directly presented at the hearing or included in the case file. Overall, the looming decision on Blanton's parole presents a significant and charged point of discussion within the current context of racial tensions, examining the principles of justice, rehabilitation, and public sentiment in these decisions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You know, the good ol’ nature. One time, me and my buddy Alex and some friends decided we were going to go camping. (I know, basic camping story. Well not exactly.) We planned on going for the weekend. Got to the spot and put up our tents like normal campers. But knowing myself and my friends we wanted to drink a couple beers and do some fishing. We did just that. Later that night we had started out camp fire and cooked up some links before bed time. My drunk self wanted to keep the fire going all night to prevent wild animals from coming t our sight. Well at least I thought that’d help. So I needed a bunch of wood to do so. Everyone was asleep by this point but me. So I took myself out into the woods a little deeper to grab a full broken down tree. I thought to myself, “Well if I want to utilize all of this wood I’m going to need to break it into smaller prices right?” Wrong. Well at least it was wrongful of how I planned on doing it. I attempted to break the tree in half by throwing it against another tree, as if I were as strong as the hulk or something. Once I chunked the tree at this tree I messed the entire vacation up. The tree came down on my knee and crushed it. I was in so much pain. I realized that I messed it up pretty bad so I laid there for a second trying to get back to my feet. The next day I couldn’t apply any pressure and couldn’t walk at all. I was dirty and smelly and needed some serious help on my leg but I was too far from any civilization.

Answer the following question: I was introduced to the amazing range of handmade products from Okoii back in July and intended to post reviews in early September; however, was struck down with a particularly potent uterine parasite that left me comatosed on the couch each evening by about 8.00pm, so blogging had to take a massive back step. Now that my energy levels are returning I though that it is about time I told you about these amazing products! Okoii products are handmade by Yoko, formally from Japan, now living in Australia. Her aim was to introduce Australian women to traditional natural ingredients from Japan and Asia that they may not previously have been aware of. Some of these ingredients have been used in Japan for upwards of 1000 years, and recently the benefits of such ingredients have been scientifically proven. When you place an order with Okoii, your products are then made by hand, one by one, so you know that they are as fresh as they can possibly be. Other than Lush' Fresh Face Masks, I can't think of any other product that would be as fresh as Okoii. I find it quite exciting to know that when I purchase a product from Okoii, that it hasn't been sitting on the shelf of a warehouse for months, slowly deteriorating. It is recommended that the products be kept in the fridge to maintain their freshness and the all come with a recommended used by date that is between 3-6 months from when it was made. The first product that I am going to introduce you to is the Luxury Rice Bran Face Soap. I decided to review this one on its own for two reasons. Firstly, it was my absolute favourite of all the Okoii products I tried; and secondly, it was actually the product that I was most fearful of trying. Why? Well, the first beauty rule that is drummed into every girls head is to NEVER USE SOAP ON YOUR FACE and I was being forced to break this rule (I am a first born goodie goodie who NEVER breaks the rules - this was tough for me to do!). Yoko assured me that this soap was incredibly gentle and was not at all drying. Lucky for her I am...

Write highlights for this article: A German religious forum took an unexpected turn yesterday when three topless protesters had to be dragged out of the building. The Berlin Islam Week event, held in one of the city's town halls, was stopped in its tracks by members of extreme protest group Femen, who charged into the hall with slogans attacking 'religious oppression' and Sharia law daubed on their bodies. Photographs from the moment the women were dragged out by policemen show a bemused-looking woman filming the event on her phone as unimpressed guests look on. Disturbance: One of the three Femen protesters is held on the ground by a policeman as a woman records the event on her phone. Protest: Three protesters from Femen stormed the stage at Berlin's Islam Week event. 'Dialogue': The women were dragged out of the event, at a Berlin town hall, after revealing their stridently anti-Islam views. Other images show the three on stage during a discussion, where speakers were confronted with the messages written on their bodies and also on banners which they waved above their heads while shouting. Femen, which began in Eastern Europe, is notorious for using nudity to promote their message of female emancipation and protest against governments and organisations with which they disagree. Berlin Islam Week is open to atheists and those of other religions as well as Muslims, according to promotional material, which describes the event as 'an important part of inter-religious dialogue process '. The description says this year's event aimed to 'provide a platform for exchange and to strengthen dialogue' and mentioned talks with 'religious, inter-religious , social and historical themes.' A spokesman for the event said that guests reacted 'appropriately' to the 'act of provocation' and continued the event afterwards. Coverage: The group has generated significant attention in recent years with its topless protest. Disruption: The three women, one of whom was said to have once been a Muslim herself, complained about Sharia law and 'religious oppression' Event: Berlin Islam Week is said to be a platform for discussion between religions. Following the event, Femen posted a statement online which attacked the Muslim system of law and claimed that the event was part of a culture which 'is responsible for many crimes'. It said: 'Femen is outraged that the city of Berlin offered a public platform and support to the community that openly spreads inhuman ideology and calls for violence and incitement...' 'Femen calls western government [sic], do not ignore the fact that the violent form of Islam found its niche in the western democratic society. It operates in the parallel world in the midst of our society and is responsible for many crimes.' 'We want to encourage all women to free themselves from patriarchal structures! You are worth as much as your fathers and brothers, you have a right to physical integrity, you have a right to make your own decisions, you have a right to self-determination, to love and freedom!' Following the event, a spokesman for Berlin Islam Week told MailOnline: 'Although [the protest] was intended as an act of deliberate. provocation, we did not defer to it. 'The audience, mainly from the Muslim. community, reacted to the disturbance appropriately, so that we all were very. quickly able to eventually continue the program of the Islam Week.' Femen has described it aims as 'fighting patriarchy in its three manifestations - sexual exploitation of women, dictatorship and religion.' Posts: After the event, Femen attacked the Berlin local government for lettings its buildings be used for Islam Week. Dragged out: Femen has often courted controversy by disrupting events with its messages. History: A Femen protester can be seen here last year confronting Vladimir Putin and Angela Merkel. The group has shot to fame in recent years after sending its topless activists to disrupt high-profile events and political leaders. Last year Russian president Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were confronted with a topless protester at a trade fair in Hanover. In September Femen members caused further controversy by storming the catwalk at Paris Fashion Week during a show by designer Nina Ricci. More recently, the group, which was founded by a Ukrainian, has mounted protests outside the Crimean parliament in Simferopol after the referendum which saw the region transferred from Ukraine to Russia.","output":"At a recent Berlin Islam Week event held in one of the city's town halls, three topless protesters from the extreme protest group Femen created a disturbance.

Dionnas cousin asks to be taken home and Vinny offers to give her a ride, allowing Dionna to stay. We soon discover the real reason he offered to take her home was to have sex with her in the back seat of his car.

The key words and phrases to focus on here are: 1. \\"A young girl\\" - This tells us that the subject is a young female. 2. \\"naps\\" - This indicates that the girl is sleeping for a short period of time, commonly referred to as a nap. 3. \\"on a giant pillow on the couch\\" - This provides information about the location and situation of the girl while napping. 4. \\"cuddled up with her favorite blanket\\" - This description adds more detail about the girl's comfort and points to something she finds reassuring and cozy while sleeping. Hypothesis: \\"A girl is taking a nap.\\" In the hypothesis, the key words and phrases are: 1. \\"A girl\\" - This is a reference to a female subject, matching the description in the premise. 2. \\"is taking a nap\\" - This statement directly focuses on the act of sleeping for a short period of time. Now, let's compare the information given in the premise and hypothesis. The premise mentions a young girl napping, and the hypothesis suggests that a girl is taking a nap.

Concurrently, a young Chen joins the police force but is seemingly expelled from the academy even though he manages to impress Superintendent Wong Chi-shing. In reality, Chen has become an undercover agent reporting only to Wong. Over the course of ten years, Chen experiences great stress from his undercover work while Lau quickly rises through the ranks in the police department. The film begins with a meeting between Chen and Lau in a hi-fi store without either of them knowing the other's identity. Wong and his team interrupt a deal between Hon Sam and a Thai cocaine dealer after receiving a tip-off from Chen using Morse code. However, Lau alerts Hon, giving him enough time to order his minions to dispose of the cocaine, eliminating solid evidence of the drug deal. After the incident, Wong and Hon are both aware that they each have a mole within their respective organisations, placing them in a race against time to root out the other mole. Later, Chen sees Hon conversing with Lau at a cinema but does not see Lau's face clearly; he ultimately fails to capture Lau. By this time, both Chen and Lau are struggling with their double identities â Chen starts losing faith in himself as a cop after being a gangster for ten years; Lau becomes more accustomed to the life of a police officer and he wants to erase his criminal background. At their next meeting, Wong intends to pull Chen out of undercover work for fear of his safety. They are unaware that Lau has his...","output":"Can't answer"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump disclosed in a financial report filed with the government’s ethics watchdog Tuesday that he had reimbursed his personal lawyer more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses. In his annual financial disclosure form, which was released by the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that he had “fully reimbursed” his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in the range of 100,000 to 250,000 in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 Cohen paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied the affair but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen through a monthly retainer to stop “false and extortionist accusations” made by Daniels about an affair. Cohen has also acknowledged making the payment. The disclosure said that while the payment to Cohen was not a “reportable” liability, Trump chose to list it “in the interest of transparency.” It did not say why Trump had left it out of his 2017 financial disclosure documents, though one of the president’s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, has said that Trump didn’t know about the payment when he reported his finances last year. The Office of Government Ethics, in a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said it had determined that the payment to Cohen constituted a loan that should have been reported. However, it said the information Trump provided in his latest financial form met “the disclosure requirements for a reportable liability” under the Ethics in Government Act. Under the Ethics in Government Act, top government officials are required to report all debts in excess of 10,000 during the previous reporting period. “Knowingly or willfully” falsifying or failing to file reports carries civil and criminal penalties. Trump listed several hundred million dollars in liabilities in his financial report. Critics seized on...

Bored with their lives, they decide to move to Los Angeles, and set out on a cross-country drive. In Utah they assist Elvis impersonator \\"Daredelvis\\" with getting his trailer unstuck. Later, Grant sees a mirage of a cowboy on horseback. While camping in the Arizona desert they are attacked by a gang of vicious rednecks, and Milo is murdered by their leader, Missoula. Grant and Biscuit escape and collapse in the desert, where Grant again sees a vision of the cowboy. The local sheriffs do not believe the boys' story, having no record of Missoula or his gang and being unable to find Milo's body as evidence of the murder. Grant resolves to track down the gang and avenge Milo's death, despite Biscuit's reservations. Heading back into Utah, they find one of the gang's trucks overturned and several of the members dead. Before dying, one of them reveals that they planned to turn themselves in but were killed by Missoula, who is headed north through Wyoming to Montana. The boys also meet Jessie, a young woman who runs a gas station and towing business.

This House would give cash to the poor to reduce poverty What argument could one make about this debate topic?","output":"In the debate surrounding whether to give cash to the poor as a means to reduce poverty, there are several strong arguments in favor of this proposition. Advocates for the direct transfer of financial resources to individuals living in poverty argue that it is an effective, efficient, and empowering strategy to combat poverty at its core. The following points outline the main arguments for this perspective: 1. Empowerment and Self-sufficiency: Direct cash transfers enable recipients to use the resources in ways that best suit their individual needs and circumstances. People living in poverty often have an intimate understanding of their financial priorities, and by giving them the flexibility to allocate funds as needed, it empowers them to make informed decisions, fostering a sense of self-sufficiency and personal responsibility. 2. Economic Stimulus: Various studies have indicated that cash transfers can drive local economic growth. As recipients increase their consumption, they create demand for goods and services, which in turn generates income for local businesses and increases employment opportunities. Thus, cash transfers have a positive multiplier effect, bolstering economic development in areas characterized by poverty. 3. Efficient and Transparent: The administration of cash transfers, especially those implemented through digital channels, can be more cost-effective than traditional aid programs that require the distribution of physical goods or services. In addition, cash transfers are more transparent and easier to track, which reduces the risk of corruption and misuse of funds. 4. Fewer Dependency and Better Outcomes: Contrary to the notion that cash transfers can lead to dependency, studies have consistently shown that recipients of cash transfers typically use the funds productively, investing in education, healthcare, and income-generating activities. This contributes to improved social outcomes, such as higher school enrollment rates, better health indicators, and reduced child labor. 5. Dignity and Respect: Traditional aid programs often involve the distribution of predetermined goods and services, which may not align with the actual needs and priorities of the recipients. Cash transfers, on the other hand, afford the beneficiaries the respect and dignity of making their own choices, prioritizing their most pressing needs, and working toward a sustainable future. 6. Short-Term Relief and Long-Term Impact: Cash transfers provide immediate relief to households in need, enabling them to meet their essential needs such as food, shelter, and clothing. Additionally, cash transfers can have a long-term positive impact by allowing recipients to invest in assets and income-generating activities that will help them break the cycle of poverty over time. 7. Access to Financial Services: The direct transfer of cash can be used as a tool for promoting financial inclusion. By linking cash transfers to formal financial services, such as bank accounts or mobile wallets, recipients can develop positive financial habits, build credit, and access other essential services, including insurance and credit. 8. Leveraging Technology: The rapid proliferation of mobile and digital technologies can facilitate the efficient and secure delivery of cash transfers. This allows for a streamlined and cost-effective means to reach even the most underserved populations, including those living in remote and rural areas. Overall, the argument in favor of providing cash to the poor to reduce poverty is rooted in the belief that direct financial assistance empowers recipients, stimulates the local economy, and promotes efficient use of resources. By respecting the autonomy and agency of individuals, cash transfers can lead to both short-term relief and long-term sustainable development, ultimately breaking the cycle of poverty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But for some, the venue, a stadium in a suburban area of Mumbai, was too far to travel, and for others tickets were too expensive, the best reportedly priced at 75,000 rupees (Â£905; 1,165). But that did not dampen the spirits of the fans, popularly known as Beliebers, who chose to follow the concert on TV and social media.

So it seemed nothing could go wrong for Bieber in India... at least not until he performed. Looking at the euphoria before his concert, nobody expected any negative feedback. But some felt that the singer lip-synced some of his songs, and that did not go down well with his fans. Many have taken to Twitter to express their feelings about the singer's performance. Justin Bieber has not made any comment. Some fans, however, chose to defend Bieber, saying Indians should not feel offended because they are used to Bollywood stars lip-syncing songs recorded by professional playback singers. And some are also upset about the choice of his casual clothes on stage. And finally, Bieber reportedly left India shirtless, and it didn't go unnoticed in the media... or maybe he was just changing his shirt? A summary of the above article is?","output":"The article discusses a concert by Justin Bieber held in a suburban stadium in Mumbai, which was attended by fans, also known as \\"Beliebers.\\" Some fans faced challenges such as the high ticket prices, with the best priced at 75,000 rupees (1,165), or the far-off location of the stadium. Despite these issues, many fans chose to follow the concert through TV and social media.  Local media reported about an extensive list of the pop star's requirements during his stay in Mumbai, including a washing machine, glass-door refrigerators, and a jacuzzi. However, this did not affect the enthusiasm of his Indian fans. Prior to the concert, the excitement was palpable, and nobody anticipated any negative feedback. Nonetheless, after the concert, some fans complained that Bieber lip-synced some of his songs, which led to their displeasure, and many expressed their feelings on Twitter. Some fans defended the singer, arguing that Indians should not be offended given that they are accustomed to Bollywood stars lip-syncing songs recorded by professional playback singers. Furthermore, some fans were disappointed by Bieber's choice of casual clothing during his performance. The article concludes by noting that Bieber left India shirtless, which caught media attention, although it was possibly just for a change of wardrobe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Would \\"American companies accepted it in 1949.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"General average sacrifice is a legal principle in maritime law that deals with the allocation of shared losses and costs incurred by all parties who have an interest in a vessel and its cargo when an extraordinary sacrifice or expenditure is made to preserve the ship and its cargo from a common peril. This concept finds its origins in the Lex Rhodia, an ancient set of sea laws dating back to around 800 BCE from the island of Rhodes, and it remains a fundamental aspect of modern maritime law today. In a general average sacrifice, when the ship and its cargo are threatened by an imminent danger during a voyage, an intentional and reasonable sacrifice or expenditure can be made by the ship's crew to save the majority of the property. This could involve activities such as jettisoning cargo overboard to lighten the ship in a storm or cutting away damaged masts and rigging. The financial loss resulting from this extraordinary sacrifice or expenditure would then be proportionally shared among all the parties with an interest in the vessel and its cargo. The concept of general average sacrifice is founded on the idea that all interested parties should contribute to the loss in accordance with the benefits they derive from the common safety of the ship and its cargo. To make such a claim, various conditions need to be met, such as that the circumstances must warrant extraordinary measures, the deliberate action must be reasonable, and there must be actual or imminent danger. The York-Antwerp Rules, first devised in 1890 and revised multiple times since then, are a set of internationally recognized rules governing general average claims. These rules provide guidelines for the calculation and apportionment of financial loss among ship owners, cargo owners, and other interested parties, such as insurers. Now, to address the second part of your question, stating that \\"American companies accepted it in 1949\\" is an oversimplification and may not accurately reflect the historical developments related to the general average principle in the United States. While the York-Antwerp Rules have been widely adopted around the world, it is important to note that the rules themselves have undergone several revisions over the years, including in 1924, 1950, 1974, and 1994, all of which have had varying levels of acceptance in different jurisdictions. However, it is true that the United States has accepted the general average principle, and the York-Antwerp Rules were incorporated into American maritime law following the adoption of the 1950 version. In conclusion, the general average sacrifice is a long-standing and fundamental concept in maritime law aimed at the fair apportionment of costs and losses among all parties involved in a common maritime adventure when extraordinary sacrifices are made to preserve the ship and its cargo. While it is correct to say that the United States has accepted the general average principle and the York-Antwerp Rules, referring to a specific date such as 1949 may not be accurate as the York-Antwerp Rules have undergone revisions and updates over the years, with varying levels of acceptance in different countries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

While waiting for the next river boat out, she spars with hardworking big game hunter Victor Marswell (Clark Gable), who (initially) pegs her as a certain disreputable type. When the river boat returns, it brings Donald Nordley (Donald Sinden) and his wife Linda (Grace Kelly). The Nordleys wish to go on safari to film gorillas. Marswell declines to guide them. Honey Bear rejoins the group after the steamer runs aground. Tensions run high between the two women when Linda is also attracted to Marswell. Marswell agrees to take the Nordleys into gorilla country, taking Honey Bear halfway to join the District Commissioner, who can then escort her back to civilization.

After Clint Crockett accidentally tips over Smith's canoe, he and his sister Karen escort Smith to the family mansion where he meets the entire Crockett family. The grouchy, wheelchair-bound patriarch Jason intends on spending the next day enjoying both the 4th of July and his own birthday celebrations uninterrupted. Due to the mutual dislike of the fauna around the mansion, Jason sends a man named Grover to spray pesticide in order to get rid of the frogs.

Is \\"Ibn Sīnā's commentaries on Aristotle often criticized the philosopher,[citation needed] encouraging a lively debate in the spirit of ijtihad.\\" a good answer to the question \\"What is one of the subjects of a treatise by Ibn Sina?\\"","output":"While the statement provided does shed light on the fact that Ibn Sīnā (also known as Avicenna) interacted with and often criticized Aristotle's works, it does not directly answer the question about the subject of a treatise written by Ibn Sīnā. A more detailed and fitting response to the question would encompass the various topics Ibn Sīnā covered in his works and demonstrate his engagement with Aristotle's ideas. One such answer could be: Ibn Sīnā, a Persian polymath during the Islamic Golden Age, contributed significantly to a multitude of disciplines, such as philosophy, theology, medicine, mathematics, and astronomy. His philosophical works often include extensive engagement with Aristotle's ideas, either in the form of commentaries, interpretations, or even disagreements. The subjects of his treatises encompass many intellectual domains, with perhaps the most notable and influential among them being his magnum opus, \\"Kitāb al-Shifāʾ\\" (The Book of Healing), and \\"Al-Qānūn fī al-Ṭibb\\" (The Canon of Medicine). \\"Kitāb al-Shifāʾ\\" is a comprehensive, encyclopedic work covering logic, mathematics, physics, metaphysics, and psychology. Through this compilation, Ibn Sīnā aimed not only to correct and expand upon the works of Aristotle but also to develop his own novel philosophical insights. For example, in the metaphysical portion of the \\"Kitāb al-Shifāʾ\\", Ibn Sīnā raises objections against the Aristotelian understanding of the world and puts forth his argument for the existence of God based on the contingency and necessity of existence. \\"Al-Qānūn fī al-Ṭibb\\" is another prominent treatise authored by Ibn Sīnā, functioning as a prominent medical encyclopedia throughout the Islamic and Western world for many centuries. As the title suggests, the primary focus of this work is medicine and medical practice. The Canon of Medicine provides a detailed and systematic account of medical knowledge of the time, including diagnoses, treatments, and preventative measures. While the work does not critically engage with Aristotle, it does demonstrate the extensive Greco-Arabic medical tradition that ultimately informed it, where Aristotle's own writings on biology and natural science undoubtedly played a role. Overall, while Ibn Sīnā did engage in debates and criticisms of Aristotle in his writings, the subjects of his treatises cover a broad range of topics. \\"Kitāb al-Shifāʾ\\" is a prime example of a work that embodies a more direct interaction with Aristotle's ideas within the realms of philosophy and metaphysics, while \\"Al-Qānūn fī al-Ṭibb\\" reflects the broader intellectual heritage Ibn Sīnā built upon, including the impact Aristotle had on scientific thinking."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context: Over the centuries, Weimar remained a small town of less than 5,000 inhabitants. When it became the capital of Saxe-Weimar in 1572, population growth was stimulated and population increased from 3,000 in 1650 to 6,000 in 1750. Around the year 1800, Weimar had 7,000 inhabitants. Their number grew constantly over the years to 13,000 in 1850, 28,000 in 1900 and 35,000 at the beginning of World War I. During the interwar period, the new capital of Thuringia saw a population boom, which led to 65,000 inhabitants in 1940. Since that time, the population levels have stagnated. The years 2009 to 2012 brought a moderate growth of approximately 0.35% p. a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Weimar. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders. How many years did it take for the population of Saxe-Weimar to increase by 1000 inhabitants from the year 1750?","output":"To find the number of years it took for the population of Saxe-Weimar to increase by 1,000 inhabitants from the year 1750, we need to look at the population numbers mentioned in the text and find the year when the population increased from 6,000 in 1750 to 7,000. The text states that around the year 1800, Weimar had 7,000 inhabitants. So, we can calculate the number of years it took for the population to increase by 1,000: 1800 (year with 7,000 inhabitants) - 1750 (year with 6,000 inhabitants) = 50 years It took 50 years for the population of Saxe-Weimar to increase by 1,000 inhabitants from the year 1750."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On 13 June walruses attacked and damaged the kayaks, causing another stop for repairs. On 17 June, as they prepared to leave again, Nansen thought he heard a dog bark and went to investigate. He then heard voices, and a few minutes later encountered a human being. It was Frederick Jackson, who had organised his own expedition to Franz Josef Land after being rejected by Nansen, and had based his headquarters at Cape Flora on Northbrook Island, the southernmost island of the archipelago.

As he approached, Jackson saw \\"a tall man, wearing a soft felt hat, loosely made, voluminous clothes and long shaggy hair and beard, all reeking with black grease\\". After a moment's awkward hesitation, Jackson recognised his visitor: \\"You are Nansen, aren't you?\\", and received the reply \\"Yes, I am Nansen.\\"Johansen was rescued, and the pair taken to the base at Cape Flora, where they posed for photographs (in one instance re-enacting the Jackson–Nansen meeting) before taking baths and haircuts.

She has a passion for cooking and dreams of one day opening her own restaurant. However, she also struggles with her weight and body image issues, feeling that her size limits her chances of being successful and accepted in a society that values physical appearance. James Henderson, the antagonist, is a handsome, well-to-do, and extremely popular local physical fitness instructor. He comes from a wealthy family and seems to have everything going for him. He has a beautiful girlfriend, runs a successful gym, and is admired by many in the town. However, James' dark side is his insensitivity and superficial nature, as he judges people and degrades them based on their looks. Jane and James cross paths for the first time in an annual community potluck event, where Jane brings her homemade pastries. James, seeing Jane's weight, cruelly criticizes her, shaming her in front of everyone for her choice of desserts and claims that she would never be successful or achieve her dreams because of her size. Humiliated and heartbroken, Jane leaves the event early. Act 2: Feeling defeated, Jane retreats to her comfort zone. However, her best friend Sarah, a confident and sassy young woman, refuses to let Jane feel defeated by James' words.

Jane begins to cook healthier meals and slowly introduces exercise into her daily routine. Throughout her journey, she meets others on similar paths and forms a supportive community around her. While Jane's body starts to change, she also begins to focus on honing her culinary skills and working towards her dream of owning a restaurant. In a turn of events, Jane and her new friends decide to organize an outdoor culinary event featuring healthier and delicious dishes as an alternative to the regular potluck. Act 3: On the day of the culinary event, the entire town gathers to celebrate health and appreciates the hard work that Jane and her friends have put into organizing it. The event receives massive applause, and everyone is awestruck with Jane's scrumptious yet healthy dishes, even attracting interest from a local investor who sees potential in her idea of opening a healthy eating restaurant. The climax occurs when James, realizing that he might lose his popularity and influence, challenges Jane to a cook-off at a local charity event. Jane, who has gained a tremendous amount of self-confidence, accepts the challenge. At the charity cook-off, Jane and James give their best performances. While Jane showcases her newly learned healthy cooking skills, James struggles with cooking healthily. In the end, Jane wins over the crowd and the judges alike with her delightful, wholesome dishes. James admits defeat. In the final scene, Jane opens her healthy eating restaurant, named \\"Embrace,\\" with the help of the investor. The restaurant becomes an instant hit, and she becomes a role model for people to embrace themselves and their dreams, regardless of their size. In a twist, James starts working on himself, following Jane's footsteps, learning from her and eventually becomes her friend.

News article: Regulator opens new front in battle over JPMorgan energy trading We all know what corporate law firms are for, right? To represent their clients' interest fairly and professionally, of course. To obfuscate, obstruct, delay, misdirect — sometimes that too. So the saga of JPMorgan Ventures Energy Corp. and a slick little two-step it engaged in with its two law firms to fend off the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission bears exceptional interest, not least because its outcome may hint at a new approach to enforcement by that long-overmatched agency. To put things in a nutshell, JPMorgan's electricity trading operation was accused of bid-rigging by the California Independent System Operator, which manages much of the state's wholesale power market through regular auctions. We explained in an earlier column how the alleged scheme in 2010 and 2011 may have cost California ratepayers as much as 200 million. FERC duly launched an investigation of JPMorgan's trading, which will take months at least and could cost the firm a maximum of 1 million for every day it's found to have violated trading rules. Given that revenue of 14 billion a year flows into the JPMorgan division that houses the energy trading unit, that fine wouldn't count for much more than a rounding error. That may be why manipulation seems to be a chronic disease of the California wholesale electricity market — and of those in other regions. For example, FERC has accused Deutsche Bank's energy trading arm of bogus bidding in the California market and threatened it with a 1.5-million penalty. Deutsche Bank has until Oct. 19 to respond to the allegations. JPMorgan, which doesn't own a power plant in California but has trading rights to the output of 10 Southern California generating stations, keeps FERC and the California ISO on their toes all by itself. In 2011, days after ISO closed the original loophole it says Morgan exploited, the firm found another one, according to ISO filings. That chicanery cost ratepayers 5.3 million over just five days, ISO said. Just last month, JPMorgan was alleged to have exploited yet two more loopholes in the trading rules, which may have garnered the firm nearly 10 million in possibly excessive payments. The California ISO is currently withholding 3.7 million from the firm, apparently to cover its losses. FERC hasn't launched an investigation of that trading, and Morgan has said it has done nothing wrong. This month FERC opened a new front in this battle. The commission charged that JPMorgan, with the assistance of its lawyers, gave it the runaround when it asked for financial information in connection with its investigation. According to FERC public documents, JPMorgan dodged the request for months and then provided misleading and incomplete information. How ticked off is FERC? It's proposing not to fine JPMorgan over the information exchanges, but to suspend its right to participate in the California auction. To an electricity trading firm, that's a nuclear attack. The last electricity wholesaler that got its trading rights revoked was Enron — after it went bankrupt. If FERC follows through, JPMorgan would still be allowed to sell electricity in California, but would be allowed only to collect its costs plus a nominal profit. That's likely to be a fraction of what it could make by bidding in the open auction, and it could drive JPMorgan out of the market. \\"When a company is faced with significant sanctions, not just a financial slap on the wrist, it's going to take it seriously,\\" says Tyson Slocum, director of the energy program at the Washington public interest group Public Citizen. \\"No longer is a violation just a calculated risk, and a cost of doing business if they get caught.\\" JPMorgan will have until mid-October to respond to FERC's show-cause order, which asks why the firm's bidding rights shouldn't be suspended. So let's take a closer look at its alleged subterfuge. The case began May 4, 2011, when the California ISO, as part of the investigation into the bidding allegations, asked JPMorgan for trading and other financial data related to its trading in the California wholesale market. Morgan was to comply by May 18. On deadline day, Morgan's lawyers wrote back, telling ISO in essence to stuff it. They pointed to a regulation stating that once ISO referred its accusations against Morgan to FERC, ISO lost its right to demand any data from Morgan. The lawyers repeated that position in two letters in June. JPMorgan did provide ISO with some of the data it requested, but waited until as long as 162 days after the deadline. (It said it was doing so \\"voluntarily.\\") In February, the fed-up ISO fined Morgan 486,000 for the delay. JPMorgan then filed its own complaint with FERC, stating in essence that it was being harassed by ISO. It noted that the rule clearly states that once a matter is in FERC's hands, ISO \\"shall not undertake any investigative steps,\\" which include issuing demands for information. Morgan asked FERC to overrule the \\"unreasonable\\" 486,000 penalty. Here's the punch line. Morgan flagrantly misrepresented the rule, which says, in its totality, that ISO can't \\"undertake any investigative steps except at the express direction of FERC.\\" Moreover, FERC indeed had given ISO that \\"express direction.\\" The commission had notified JPMorgan in writing that it had done so, via two separate emails to JPMorgan's lawyers at the Washington firm of Sutherland, Asbill & Brennan. And Sutherland had acknowledged receiving them, also in writing. All this was laid out in a filing by FERC's enforcement staff June 19. The staff accused JPMorgan of misleading the commission about the \\"express direction\\" rule, and called the firm's claim that it never knew ISO was acting at FERC's direction a lie. Within days after the staff blew the whistle, JPMorgan fessed up. It admitted that there was \\"a factual error\\" in its original complaint and swore that it hadn't intended to mislead FERC. It explained that the attorneys at Sutherland had forgotten all about the emails they'd received from the commission in 2011, so they hadn't mentioned them to attorneys at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, who had drafted JPMorgan's complaint to FERC. Morgan also pledged to withdraw its complaint posthaste. \\"We hope this … shows that we acted in good faith at all times with no intent to mislead anyone,\\" the Skadden Arps lawyers told the commission, as if to plead no harm, no foul. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has opened a new front in its battle against JPMorgan Ventures Energy Corp. over alleged bid-rigging in the California wholesale electricity market. The regulator accuses JPMorgan's electricity trading operation of costing California ratepayers up to 200 million in 2010 and 2011 due to its manipulation of the market. FERC has now launched an investigation and may fine JPMorgan 1 million for every day it violated the trading rules.  In addition to the ongoing investigation, FERC has also accused JPMorgan of dodging requests for financial information related to the case and providing misleading and incomplete information in response. Instead of issuing more fines, FERC is considering suspending JPMorgan's right to participate in the California auction—a move that could have significant consequences for the electricity trading firm, possibly driving them out of the market.  JPMorgan has until mid-October to respond to FERC's show-cause order, which asks why the firm's bidding rights should not be suspended. This case may indicate a new approach to enforcement by FERC, with significant sanctions being imposed on companies found to be in violation of regulations, rather than just financial penalties."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Process: - Owls have specially adapted eyes that see better at night - Owls sit at high points in trees and look around - When an owl spots a rodent they track it - When the rodent is standing still the owl swoops down - The owl grabs the rodent with their tallons - The owl uses their beak to eat the rodent.  Question: suppose more economical program used happens, how will it affect there are more tall trees.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"The question seems to be asking how a more economical program used would affect the presence of more tall trees and how this might influence the owl's ability to sit at high points in trees and look around for prey, which is the second effect mentioned in the given process. An increase in the number of tall trees could potentially be affected by a more economical program if the program focuses on forest conservation, tree planting, or sustainable forestry practices. For instance, a program that promotes the planting of more trees, protects existing forests, or encourages selective logging instead of clear-cutting could lead to an increase in tree density, including taller trees.  If there are indeed more tall trees, then the second effect mentioned, which is owls sitting at high points in trees and looking around, might be influenced in a few ways. Firstly, with more tall trees available, owls may have more options for perching sites, increasing their range and potentially enhancing their abilities to observe and hunt for prey. The increased availability of tall trees might also help owls evade predators more easily by providing more hiding spots or nesting sites. However, too many tall trees in a dense forest might not necessarily translate into better hunting opportunities. Owls rely on their keen sense of sight and sound to locate efficient hunting grounds. If a forest is too dense and the understory is filled with numerous branches or thick foliage, it could obstruct the owl's vision and hinder their ability to spot a prey, like a rodent. Additionally, the density of trees might also reduce the chances of prey emerging due to limited movement. In such cases, the second effect mentioned in the process might be unfavorably impacted. In conclusion, the effect of a more economical program leading to an increase in tall trees on the owl's ability to sit at high points in trees and look around for prey could be either positive or negative, depending on whether the increase in tall trees leads to better perching sites and visibility or obstructs the owl's vision and hunting opportunities. This influence could make the effect of increased tall trees be either more or less effective depending on the specific context and environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's choice to lead the Department of Homeland Security, retired Marine General John Kelly, is one of the U.S. military's longest-serving commanders and the most senior officer since 9/11 to lose a child in combat. Blunt-spoken and popular with military personnel, Kelly, 66, was born and raised in Boston. He initially enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1970, and was discharged from active duty as a sergeant in 1972. He returned to the Marine Corps after graduation from the University of Massachusetts Boston in 1976. Kelly rose through the ranks to serve as the commanding general of the Multi-National Force West in Iraq from February 2008 to February 2009, and as the commander of Marine Forces Reserve and Marine Forces North in October 2009. He succeeded General Douglas Fraser as commander of U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) on Nov. 19, 2012. As the head of USSOUTHCOM, Kelly was in charge of the military jail at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and also was exposed to immigration, drug trafficking and other cross-border problems over a sprawling area that encompasses 32 countries in the Caribbean, Central America and South America. Kelly took a tough tone on border security, warning Congress last year about the risks of smuggling rings in Mexico and Central America that spirited \\"tens of thousands of people,\\" including unaccompanied children, \\"to our nation's doorstep.\\" He also clashed with the Obama administration over plans to close Guantanamo and the Pentagon's order that opened all jobs in combat units to women, including the most elite forces like the Navy SEALs. In 2010, Kelly became the highest ranking U.S. military officer to lose a child in combat operations in Southwest Asia. His youngest son, 1st Lieutenant Robert Michael Kelly, was killed in action in Afghanistan on Nov. 9, 2010.

(CNN) -- Iran has stepped up its production of high-grade enriched uranium and has re-landscaped one of its military bases in an apparent effort to hamper a United Nations inquiry into the country's nuclear program, a U.N. report said Thursday. Iran's facilities have produced 189.4 kilograms (417.6 pounds) of the enriched uranium, an increase of 43.8 kilograms (96.6 pounds) since the last U.N. analysis in May, the report said. That enriched uranium is produced at declared facilities in Iran that don't include the military base cited in Thursday's report. Iran hasn't allowed the agency access to the military site, called Parchin, and, in fact, has been conducting \\"extensive activities\\" at that location \\"that will significantly hamper the Agency's ability to conduct effective verification,\\" the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency said in its report. \\"Since 2002, the","output":"Agency has become increasingly concerned about the possible existence of undeclared nuclear facilities and material in Iran, particularly in light of Iran's significant increase in its production of enriched uranium,\\" the report continued. \\"These concerns have been further heightened by Iran's refusal to allow inspectors access to Parchin, which could be crucial for verifying the peaceful nature of the country's nuclear program.\\" Despite repeated requests from the U.N., Iran has remained uncooperative and has continued its efforts to hinder a comprehensive investigation into its nuclear activities. As tensions between Iran and the international community grow, many are left questioning Iran's intentions and the potential consequences of its continued nuclear expansion."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Certain items may be more appropriate for evening wear than for a business meeting, just as shorts and a T-shirt are better suited for the beach than for an office environment.

Q: Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), a type II PRMT, is highly expressed in some tumors, but its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still unknown.', 'PRMT5 level in HCC specimens was determined by immunohistochemical staining and the association with clinicopathologic features was evaluated. PRMT5 was inhibited by AMI-1 (a small molecule inhibitor of PRMTs) or small interference RNA (siRNA). The proliferation of HCC cells was tested by Cell Counting Kit-8, cell migration was evaluated by Transwell assay and cell cycle and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. The effect of AMI-1 on HCC in vivo was examined by mouse xenograft model.', 'PRMT5 expression was markedly upregulated in HCC tissues, and correlated inversely with overall patient survival. Knockdown of PRMT5 significantly reduced the proliferation of HCC cells, but did not affect the growth of normal liver cells. Furthermore, β-catenin was identified as a target of PRMT5. Silencing PRMT5 significantly down-regulated the expression of β-catenin and the downstream effector Cyclin D1 in HCC cells. AMI-1 strongly inhibited HCC growth in vivo, increased the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, and led to apoptosis and loss of migratory activity in several HCC cells. Meanwhile, AMI-1 decreased the expression levels of symmetric dimethylation of H4 (H4R3me2s), a histone mark of PRMT5.

As the Marines leave, one Marine remains and makes his way towards the exit. The Marine's name is Jesse Rodriguez (Freddy Rodriguez). The film cuts to a house where a man, Edy Rodriguez (Alfred Molina) is on a ladder nailing up a welcome home sign for Jesse. The woman, his wife, Anna Rodriguez (Elizabeth PeÃ±a) gives him a rather disgruntled look before leaving to prepare for Jesse's return. Edy then travels to his store, a small neighborhood supermarket, called Bodega. Along the way, and even in the store, Edy appears to be quite popular with the ladies. Back at the airport, Jesse finally meets up with his friend and cousin Johnny (Luis Guzman) and Ozzy (Jay Hernandez), who have come to pick him up. On the way to his fathers store, Jesse takes off his eye-patch to reveal that he can still see, but the area around his eye is badly injured. After some prompting from Johnny and Ozzy, he reveals that he was the lucky one, as his friend Lenny was not as lucky and Jesse feels some guilt for this. On the way, the three pass a park and Jesse tells them to stop. The park was their childhood playground and the three take a little time off to play a game of baseball and reminisce. While at the park, Ozzy spots Alexis (Manny PÃ©rez), the man who killed his brother, recently been released from prison.
