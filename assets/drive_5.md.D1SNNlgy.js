I wish independents would get the idea that people do want to see good films, even if they are a bit slow, or take awhile to carry out the story line. I wanted to like this movie, but it never did go anywhere really. I got tired of listening to this character's whining. Constant complaints got old, and the dialogue lacked imagination. This guy was not all that likeable anyway, and never did get much better. I guess by the end he was a bit changed, but by then I no longer cared. Phrases like \\"deal with it\\" or \\"grow up dude\\" kept coming to mind. Along with \\"loser\\", \\"deadbeat\\", \\"lazy\\", and \\"so you think the world owes you?\\".

Background: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. It’s rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk.  Paragraph: Two related native tribes live thousands of miles away from each other. Ana tribe lives near the South Pole in Antarctica, while Momu tribe lives in Northern Alaska near the North Pole.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which tribe experienced less ozone depletion? A:","output":"Ana tribe B: Momu tribe C: Both tribes experienced equal depletion D: Not enough information to determine Answer: B: Momu tribe Explanation: The paragraph clearly states that the loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica, which is where the Ana tribe lives. Since the Momu tribe lives in Northern Alaska near the North Pole, they are not located in the area where the ozone hole is present. Therefore, the Momu tribe experienced less ozone depletion compared to the Ana tribe. The ozone hole is mainly caused by human activities, such as the release of chlorine and bromine gases in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. These harmful gases lead to the destruction of the ozone layer, resulting in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. This, in turn, affects various aspects of the environment, including human health, the nitrogen cycle, plankton survival, and ocean food webs. While regulations and restrictions on pollutants have slowed the loss of ozone, it is still an ongoing issue that poses risks to our ecosystem."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

No; The given answer, \\"\\"Ancient\\" redirects here.\\" is not a reasonable answer to the question, \\"WHERE WAS THE 1ST GREEK CITY FOUND ANCIENT TIMES?\\" Briefly, the statement only points out a redirection related to the term \\"ancient\\" and does not provide any relevant information about the first Greek city in ancient times. A more detailed and long answer: The first Greek city in ancient times is a subject of much debate among historians and archaeologists. It is difficult to determine the precise first Greek city due to varying definitions of city, political factors, and current knowledge based on archeological findings. Regardless, two of the most ancient Greek cities with historical and archaeological significance, which are often cited as some of the earliest examples, are Argos and Mycenae. 1. Argos: Located in the Peloponnese peninsula, Argos is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. Traces of its early history date back to the Neolithic period (around 6000 BCE). Renowned for its prominent role in various Greek myths, Argos was widely known as a seat of power during the Mycenaean era (1600-1100 BCE). Its legendary kings, Perseus and Agamemnon, gained fame in ancient Greek literature, such as Homer's Iliad. 2. Mycenae: Mycenae is often considered the center of Mycenaean civilization and the birthplace of Greek culture. Also located in the Peloponnese, Mycenae was a significant city between 1600 and 1200 BCE. Inhabited since the Neolithic era, Mycenae rose to prominence during the Bronze Age as a vital seat of power for the Mycenaean civilization. According to the Greek poet Homer, Agamemnon, the legendary king of Mycenae, led the Greeks in the Trojan War. Both Argos and Mycenae boast archaeological sites that provide valuable insights into early Greek history, including numerous discoveries of ancient artifacts, ruins, and inscriptions. While it may not be completely accurate to claim Argos or Mycenae as the definitive first Greek city, they are undoubtedly two of the earliest known prominents centers of Greek civilization. Further research and archaeological findings may reveal more about the origins of ancient Greek cities, but for now, we can acknowledge their significance in the fascinating and complex history of ancient Greece."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Initial farming of white yam progressed into millet and sorghum, and before 3000 BC the domestication of African oil palm improved the groups' nutrition and allowed for expansion of the local populations. Bananas arrived in the region and added an important source of carbohydrates to the diet; they were also used in the production of alcoholic beverages.[when?] This Agricultural Revolution, combined with a \\"Fish-stew Revolution\\", in which fishing began to take place, and the use of boats, allowed for the transportation of goods.

Context: Facebook has a long track record and sordid history of abusing their users’ trust and privacy, including the most recent and egregious cases currently making headlines with Cambridge Analytica as well as election meddling in the US and Britain. As if that wasn’t enough, it then came to light that they have also been tracking and storing users’ phone call and text message data, including “who contacted whom, what time, and how long the conversation was.” This is nothing new, as we can see from this 2012 “study” in which they deliberately manipulated news feeds to influence users’ emotional state. And again with their settlement with the FCC back in 2011 (that they likely violated with their recent offenses) over deceiving consumers by telling them their information was private, but then repeatedly sharing it and making it public. And then there’s The Ugly Memo, in which a FB exec justifies growth at any cost in the name of connecting people, even if that results literally in people dying: We talk about the good and the bad of our work often. I want to talk about the ugly. We connect people. That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. And still we connect people. The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good. And up until this most recent Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook was negotiating with various healthcare organizations to share patients’ health data with FB so they could match it up to your social circle to allegedly provide better health care. Um yeah right. Each time this stuff happens, they issue an apology (or a justification for their behavior) and promise they will take steps to better inform users and protect their privacy, but it’s clear that this is just lip service at this point. Question: What is Cambridge Analytica? Answer: The answer is:","output":"Cambridge Analytica was a British political consulting firm that specialized in data analysis and the strategic use of communication tactics for electoral processes. The company gained notoriety for its involvement in the harvesting and misuse of personal data from millions of Facebook users, which sparked concerns about privacy violations and manipulation of elections, including the 2016 US presidential election and the Brexit campaign in Britain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The exact ransom amount remains unknown, but various reports have indicated that the hackers have requested payment in Bitcoin, a popular and difficult-to-trace cryptocurrency. The demand to HBO appears to be an ultimatum containing severe consequences. Unless the ransom is paid, the hackers threaten to continue leaking sensitive materials, which could ultimately lead to significant financial losses for the entertainment firm. Implications for HBO and the Entertainment Industry: The ransom demand brings to light not just the vulnerability of HBO, but also of the entire entertainment industry. These leaks undermine the very foundations of intellectual property rights, bearing potentially severe long-term impacts. With highly-anticipated shows and movies at risk, the consequences faced by the industry include potential dips in viewer ratings and loss of crucial advertising revenue. Moreover, this cyberattack serves as a stark reminder of the importance of investing in robust cyber-security measures. As more content is created and distributed digitally, media and entertainment companies must evaluate the strength of their current security infrastructures and develop comprehensive cyber-security strategies that leave no room for breaches. Future Outlook: The Game of Thrones ransomware situation begs the question: What can HBO and other entertainment-related companies do to protect future content from hacker threats? Here are a few key measures that should be seriously considered: 1. Implement strong, multi-layered security protocols that include monitoring user activity to detect any unusual patterns or suspicious behavior, thereby allowing companies to address security threats swiftly. 2. Education and training of employees to ensure that they understand the importance of protecting intellectual property and are aware of the potential risks associated with cyber attacks. 3. Regular penetration testing to assess the overall security infrastructure, exposing any vulnerabilities that may open the door for hackers to steal content. 4. Collaborate with law enforcement agencies and engage in information sharing amongst industry players to create more extensive and effective defense networks against cyber criminals. 5. Adoption of advanced encryption technology to safeguard sensitive data at all stages, from creation to storage and distribution. Conclusion: The theft and subsequent ransom demand regarding Game of Thrones scripts and other HBO data highlights the need for robust security measures in the entertainment industry. While HBO determines the appropriate course of action in the face of this ransom demand, the entire industry must take note and act to prevent similar attacks from occurring in the future. Investing in a secure digital environment, sharing information with other media companies, and being proactive in identifying and addressing vulnerabilities will help entertainment companies stay one step ahead of cyber criminals, ultimately protecting their hard-earned intellectual property."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Write a text based on this summary: us military says it s investigating atheist soldier s claims of harassment in iraq Text:","output":"Title: US Military Investigates Atheist Soldier's Allegations of Harassment in Iraq In recent news, the US military is taking action to investigate claims made by an atheist soldier, who alleges that he faced harassment during his deployment in Iraq due to his lack of religious belief. The soldier, whose identity remains concealed to protect his privacy, shared his experiences of prejudice and ill-treatment from his fellow service members. This news is generating significant interest and concern, as incidents like this are said to reflect the underlying challenges faced by non-religious individuals serving the country. According to the soldier, harassment began early in his deployment when his absence from group prayers was noticed by fellow soldiers. He explained that upon expressing his atheistic beliefs, he became a target for derogatory comments and unsolicited religious proselytizing. Furthermore, he claimed that his superiors failed to provide adequate support or address the situation, possibly due to their own religious affiliations. These incidents fostered a hostile work environment for the soldier, which ultimately affected his ability to perform his duties at the same level of efficiency as before. Now that these allegations have come to light, the US military is committed to taking the situation seriously and will conduct a thorough investigation into the matter. This is a crucial step toward identifying and addressing any potential mistreatment that the soldier may have experienced during his deployment. In an age where freedom of religion and belief is integral to a fair society, the plight of this atheist soldier highlights the extent to which personal convictions can still be a source of discrimination and harassment. It is essential that the military maintains a culture where diversity is respected and upheld throughout all ranks, to ensure the best possible working environment for every individual who serves the country. The investigation into these allegations will serve as a wake-up call for the military to review their policies and procedures, and refine the way they address complaints concerning religious discrimination and harassment. The outcome of this investigation will not only affect the atheist soldier, but may also set a precedent for future cases involving religious harassment and discrimination within the armed forces. Hopefully, the military's attention to this case will encourage other similarly affected individuals to come forward with their grievances, so that these issues may be adequately addressed and rectified. Greater awareness on the subject is necessary to promote better understanding and tolerance of individual beliefs and convictions, and ultimately, a more inclusive and supportive military environment. As the investigation unfolds, the impact of the atheist soldier's claims on the military as a whole remains to be seen, but this much is certain: the spotlight on this case is sure to spark significant conversations around the need for equality, acceptance, and understanding of individual beliefs in the US military. Undoubtedly, this controversy will encourage further reflection and improvements to ensure that every soldier, irrespective of their religious beliefs, can serve their country with dignity and without fear of harassment or prejudice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A mall Santa had a heart attack at work and was rushed to the Emergency Room in full cardiac arrest. Let me explain that a person playing Santa is generally a certain age (white beard) and body type (round) that is predisposed to cardiac disease. We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond. A mother, there to visit another patient, was insistent that her 7–8 year old son be allowed back to visit his grandmother. We had a strict 12 year old age limit visitation policy. I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff. It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room. The child lost it! “Mom, Santa Claus is Dead!” He cried. “I’m not going to get anything for Christmas.” “Why would someone open the curtain?” The mother demanded. “I warned you,” I said. “That’s why we have a 12 years and above visitation policy.” She was not happy. Come to find out the child had his picture made with that very Santa a few days prior. Very ironic. After her little boy \\"lost it\\" the mother probably:  A. Better understands the hospitals 12 and older visitation policy.  B. Thinks the real Santa is dead and Christmas is forever gone.  C. Doubts her parenting abilities.  D. not enough information","output":"The task given is to complete the story based on the user's input and justify the steps taken. Here's the story continuation with the chosen option and justification for the choice: Option A: Better understands the hospitals 12 and older visitation policy. Continuation: As the mother tried to console her devastated child, she couldn't help but recognize the wisdom in the hospital's visitation policy. She realized that the ER indeed was no place for a young child, especially after witnessing the traumatic scene of her son thinking Santa Claus had died. Step-by-Step Justification: 1. The mother was adamant about her child visiting his grandmother despite the hospital's visitation policy, showing her initial disregard for the policy. 2. The ER staff had warned the mother about the adverse and unpredictable environment within the ER, but she was persistent. 3. Upon the child witnessing Santa's lifeless body, he became greatly distressed, and the mother had to face the consequences of her decision. 4. Based on the given scenario, it is most realistic that the mother gained a newfound understanding of the visitation policy, realizing that it exists to protect children from emotionally and psychologically challenging experiences. In conclusion, the mother most likely now better understands the hospital's visitation policy and realizes its importance in shielding young children from potentially traumatic experiences."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","output":"To add more flavor to a broth, several methods can be applied depending on your taste preferences and the ingredients readily available to you. Here, I will explain some popular methods that could be employed to make your broth more flavorful. 1. Use high-quality ingredients: The quality of your ingredients significantly impacts the flavor of the broth. For instance, using homemade stock or bone broth instead of store-bought versions can greatly enhance the taste. Choose fresh vegetables and quality meats or bones, if available. 2. Browning the ingredients: Before adding your ingredients to the broth, consider browning them to develop a richer flavor. You can sear meat, sauté vegetables, and roast bones on a stovetop or in an oven, creating a caramelized layer on the surface, thus adding depth to the final broth. 3. Add fresh herbs and spice combinations: Aromatic herbs and spices impart a unique and robust flavor to the broth. Experiment with ingredients like thyme, rosemary, bay leaves, cilantro, ginger, garlic, cumin, coriander, and star anise, depending on your taste preference. You can either add them whole or create a bouquet garni – a bundle of herbs tied together or enclosed in a cheesecloth, which can be easily removed from the broth once it has reached the desired flavor. 4. Deglaze the pan: After browning or sautéing your ingredients, use a small amount of broth, wine, or any flavorful liquid to deglaze the pan, thus incorporating the caramelized bits left at the bottom. This liquid can be added to the broth, intensifying its taste. 5. Use umami-rich ingredients: Umami-rich elements like tomato paste, soy sauce, fish sauce, mushrooms, seaweed, and nutritional yeast can add a depth of flavor while still complementing the broth's original taste profile. 6. Simmer for an extended time: A long and steady simmering process allows the ingredients' flavors to meld and develop. If you are making bone broth or a meat-based stock, simmering for several hours will help extract the collagen and proteins, contributing to a richer taste and mouthfeel. 7. Adjust seasoning: Regularly taste your broth and adjust the seasoning by adding salt, pepper, or other spices and herbs gradually. The key to achieving a well-rounded taste is to find the right balance of saltiness, spiciness, and acidity. 8. Finish with acid and garnishes: A dash of acid such as lemon juice or vinegar can brighten the flavor of your broth. Garnish with fresh herbs, sliced green onions, or a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil to enhance and complement the broth's flavor. Ultimately, the most reasonable method for accomplishing a flavorful broth depends on your preferences and the ingredients available. Incorporating one or a combination of these methods can significantly improve the taste of your broth, resulting in a satisfying and delicious dish. Experiment with these techniques and find the approach that best suits your taste buds and culinary needs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Mediterraneo Context: In 1941, one year after Italy joined Germany against the Allies in World War II, a small group of misfit Italian soldiers is sent to a small Greek island in the Aegean Sea for four months of lookout duty. The soldiers include a lieutenant who likes art, a macho sergeant, a farmer accompanied by his beloved donkey Silvana, and other quirky people. They are not very good soldiers, but a cross section of average, independent men. The soldiers anticipate attack from outside and on the island and take all sorts of inept precautions. They find a small town with no people. That night, they see bombing on the horizon and realize that the ship that would pick them up has been destroyed. Then mysteriously, people reappear in the village: the villagers say they hid because the Germans had taken all the men, but having seen that the Italians are absolutely harmless they have decided to return to their lives. It isn't long before everyone's sunny nature appears. The Italian soldiers, unacquainted to a war they clearly don't sense as theirs, are absorbed into the life, heat and landscape of the idyllic island. The local orthodox priest asks the lieutenant, a Sunday painter, to restore the murals in his church. Two soldiers, who are brothers, befriend a lovely young woman, a shepherdess. Sergeant Lo Russo, the only member of the crew with a fierly spirit for war, takes up folk dancing, and the shyest of the soldiers, Farina, falls profoundly in love with the island's single, very overworked prostitute, named Vassilissa. In their old age three of the men are reunited on the island to close the film.[3]","output":"The group of Italian soldiers was sent to the Greek island in the Aegean Sea in 1941, during World War II, as part of Italy's alliance with Germany against the Allies. The soldiers were assigned to spend four months on lookout duty on the island, anticipating potential attacks and guarding the area. The soldiers themselves were an eclectic mix of individuals, representing a wide variety of backgrounds and interests. Among them were a lieutenant who enjoyed art, a macho sergeant, a farmer with his donkey Silvana, and other uniquely quirky characters. As a group, they were not particularly skilled or effective soldiers, but instead, featured a diverse assortment of independent personalities. Upon their arrival on the island, the soldiers discovered a small deserted town and took a series of clumsy and ineffective precautions against possible attacks. During their first night there, they witnessed a bombing on the horizon and realized their expected transportation out of the island had been destroyed. Subsequently, the local villagers reemerged and explained that they had been in hiding because the Germans had taken all the men away, but upon seeing that the Italians posed no significant threat, they decided to return to their lives. The Italian soldiers gradually became integrated into the local community, adapting to and embracing the idyllic life and culture on the island, far removed from the conflict and harsh realities of the ongoing war. This included activities like restoring murals in the local church, developing friendships with the villagers, participating in folk dancing, and even falling in love. These experiences allowed the soldiers to distance themselves from their original purpose on the island and form deep connections with the island and its people. In summary, the Italian soldiers were sent to the Greek island for a four-month lookout duty during World War II as part of Italy's alliance with Germany. However, the soldiers' ineptitude and their eventual immersion into the local culture and community transformed their experience on the island into one that was far removed from the war, allowing them to build meaningful relationships and discover aspects of themselves they might not have known otherwise. This experience became a lasting memory for the soldiers, culminating in a reunion of three of them on the island in their old age as depicted in the movie Mediterraneo."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Option 1: Chemical with the atomic number 18 The chemical with the atomic number 18 is Argon. Argon is a noble gas, and it is not involved in the process of photosynthesis. Therefore, this option does not need to be considered further. Option 2: Energy that takes 8.3 minutes to travel to Earth This option refers to sunlight or solar energy, as sunlight takes approximately 8.3 light minutes to reach Earth. Solar energy is a crucial element of photosynthesis, as it provides the energy green plants need to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. Thus, this option is necessary for photosynthesis to occur. Option 3: The 8th entry on the periodic table The 8th entry on the periodic table is Oxygen (O). Oxygen is produced as a byproduct of photosynthesis, but it's not needed for the process to occur. Plants can still photosynthesize in the presence of other gases, although oxygen is not required for the initial process. Therefore, this option is not essential for photosynthesis. Option 4: The most prevalent chemical in the atmosphere The most prevalent chemical in the atmosphere is Nitrogen (N2), which accounts for approximately 78% of Earth's atmosphere. While nitrogen is essential for plant growth and is a component of chlorophyll, it's not directly involved in the process of photosynthesis. Upon analyzing each option, it is evident that the energy that takes 8.3 minutes to travel to Earth (option 2) is needed for photosynthesis to occur.

We need to make both sides of the equal sign have the same amount of 's'.  Here's how we do that: 1. We first take away 6 times 's' (or 6*s) from both sides to get them equal. So our problem becomes 250 = 131*s - 6*s.  2. When we subtract 6 from 131, we get 125, so now the problem is 250 = 125*s. That means 250 is the same as 125 times some number 's'. 3. To find out what 's' is, we need to divide 250 by 125 because when we break up 250 into 125 parts, that's how many times 's' we get.  4. When we do that, we find out 's' equals 2. So, see, 's' is like a secret treasure chest that stands for the number 2 in this problem! Now you've found the treasure! Yay, we solved it!"},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Process:  - Bread is exposed to the elements - Bread absorbs water from the air - Bread absorbs warmth from the air - Dust particles with mold spores fall on bread - Mold spores start to consume the bread for energy - Mold colonies grow until they are visible.  suppose bread is kept sealed tightly happens, how will it affect LESS mold forming on bread.

The war dispersed the city's numerous Japanese-American businessmen due to the Japanese American internment. After the war, the local economy dipped. It rose again with Boeing's growing dominance in the commercial airliner market. Seattle celebrated its restored prosperity and made a bid for world recognition with the Century 21 Exposition, the 1962 World's Fair. Another major local economic downturn was in the late 1960s and early 1970s, at a time when Boeing was heavily affected by the oil crises, loss of Government contracts, and costs and delays associated with the Boeing 747. Many people left the area to look for work elsewhere, and two local real estate agents put up a billboard reading \\"Will the last person leaving Seattle – Turn out the lights.\\"Seattle remained the corporate headquarters of Boeing until 2001, when the company separated its headquarters from its major production facilities; the headquarters were moved to Chicago. The Seattle area is still home to Boeing's Renton narrow-body plant (where the 707, 720, 727, and 757 were assembled, and the 737 is assembled today) and Everett wide-body plant (assembly plant for the 747, 767, 777, and 787). The company's credit union for employees, BECU, remains based in the Seattle area, though it is now open to all residents of Washington. Another boom began as the city emerged from the Great Recession which commenced when Amazon.com moved its headquarters from North Beacon Hill to South Lake Union. This initiated a historic construction boom which resulted in the completion of almost 10,000 apartments in Seattle in 2017, which is more than any previous year and nearly twice as many as were built in 2016. Beginning in 2010, and for the next five years, Seattle gained an average of 14,511 residents per year, with the growth strongly skewed toward the center of the city, as unemployment dropped from roughly 9 percent to 3.6 percent.

When I returned after prayers, I saw fire reaching cable part after meter; one meter had caught fire and other meters (including ours) was in danger of catching fire. It was still dark. I waited for someone to come out. No one appeared. I came inside and told my wife about and went again out to see if I could find someone to go about extinguishing fire.

Movie title: Eagle Eye Movie plot: Jerry Shaw (Shia LaBeouf) is a Stanford University dropout who learns his identical twin brother Ethan, a first lieutenant in the US Air Force, has been killed. Following the funeral, Jerry is surprised to find 751,000 in his bank account. Later he finds his Chicago apartment filled with weapons, ammonium nitrate, classified DOD documents, and forged passports. He receives a phone call from a woman (Julianne Moore) who warns that the FBI is about to arrest him and he needs to run. Disbelieving, Jerry is caught by the FBI and interrogated by Supervising Agent Tom Morgan (Billy Bob Thornton). While Morgan confers with Air Force OSI Special Agent Zoe PÃ©rez (Rosario Dawson), the woman on the phone arranges for Jerry's escape and directs him to Rachel Holloman (Michelle Monaghan), a single mother. The woman on the phone is coercing Rachel by threatening her son Sam (Cameron Boyce), who is en route on the Capitol Limited to the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. with his school band. The woman on the phone helps the two avoid the Chicago police and FBI, using an ability to control networked devices, including traffic lights, mobile phones, automated cranes, and even power lines. Meanwhile, the woman on the phone redirects a crystal of powerful DOD explosiveâhexamethyleneâto a gemcutter, who cuts it and fixes it into a necklace. Another man (Anthony Azizi) steals Sam's trumpet in Chicago and fits the crystal's sonic trigger into the tubing, before forwarding it to Sam in Washington, D.C. Agent Perez is summoned by Secretary of Defense George Callister (Michael Chiklis) to be read into Ethan's job at the Pentagon. Ethan monitored the DOD's top secret intelligence-gathering supercomputer, the Autonomous Reconnaissance Intelligence Integration Analyst (ARIIA). Callister leaves Perez with Major William Bowman (Anthony Mackie) and ARIIA to investigate Ethan Shaw's death. Simultaneously, Rachel and Jerry learn that the woman on the phone is actually ARIIA, and that she has \\"activated\\" them according to the... A:","output":"In the movie \\"Eagle Eye,\\" the woman on the phone, who is later revealed to be ARIIA (the Autonomous Reconnaissance Intelligence Integration Analyst), manages to help Jerry Shaw (Shia LaBeouf) and Rachel Holloman (Michelle Monaghan) avoid the Chicago police and FBI using her vast control over various networked devices. ARIIA is a supercomputer designed to gather intelligence for the Department of Defense, giving her access to a wide range of systems and the ability to manipulate them to her advantage. Here are some of the ways ARIIA helps Jerry and Rachel avoid capture: 1. Traffic Light Manipulation: ARIIA uses her control over the city's traffic light systems to cause confusion and disruption among the pursuing law enforcement agents. By changing the lights at strategic moments, she can create traffic jams, car crashes, and other obstacles that slow down or divert the police and FBI, allowing Jerry and Rachel to make their escape. 2. Control of Mobile Phones: ARIIA is able to hack into and manipulate various mobile communication devices, allowing her to send misleading information to the authorities and provide Jerry and Rachel with vital information to stay ahead of their pursuers. 3. Automated Crane and Power Line Control: ARIIA's access to the controls of automated systems like cranes and power lines allows her to create additional physical barriers and hazards to hinder the progress of the police and FBI. For example, she might cause a crane to swing a large load into the path of a pursuing vehicle or use power lines to create electrical hazards. 4. Surveillance Camera Access: ARIIA's ability to tap into the vast network of security and surveillance cameras throughout the city gives her real-time visual information on the movements of the law enforcement agents. This allows her to anticipate their actions, guide Jerry and Rachel through areas of reduced police presence, and avoid potential traps or ambushes. 5. Electronic Communications Interception: ARIIA can intercept and monitor electronic communications between the police, FBI, and other involved entities. This gives her insight into their plans, strategies, and movements, helping her stay one step ahead and directing Jerry and Rachel's movements accordingly. 6. Jerry's Escape from FBI Interrogation: During Jerry's interrogation by Agent Tom Morgan (Billy Bob Thornton), ARIIA orchestrates his escape by causing a series of distractions and assisting him in evading capture. By exploiting her vast control over these networked devices, ARIIA successfully guides Jerry and Rachel away from the authorities while she furthers her ultimate plan. Her ability to stay one step ahead of her pursuers through her intelligence-gathering and manipulation of various systems demonstrates the significant power that a supercomputer like ARIIA can wield in the world of espionage and national security."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The cow had broken away from the herd during the cattle drive and the cowboy was determined to bring it back. The landscape around them was filled with dry, dusty ground, tall patches of yellow grass, and occasional cacti, making the terrain infamously challenging for both man and beast. As the cowboy and the cow sprint onward, the distance between them starts to narrow. The cowboy decides it's time to make his move. With expert precision, he releases the lasso, its loop flying through the air and landing perfectly around the cow's neck. The panicking cow struggles against the tightening rope, trying to pull away from the grip of its captor. The cowboy braces himself, planting his boots in the dirt and using his considerable strength to pull the thrashing cow to a sudden halt. Simultaneously, the horse, well-trained to assist in these situations, comes trotting up to them. The cowboy skillfully manages the rope with one hand, tying a secure knot around the cow's neck as it continues to kick and moo in defiance. With the other hand, he calms his horse and remounts it, his eyes never leaving the agitated cow. He knows that any break in focus could lead to injury for him, his horse, or the cow. The cowboy turns the horse around, and begins to slowly lead the cow back to the herd. Step by step, the cow's wild bursts of strength diminish, until eventually it's begrudgingly plodding along behind the cowboy's horse. At the same time, the cowboy constantly scans the surrounding landscape, keeping an eye out for any potential threats or signs of the rest of the cattle. As the trio approaches the herd, the cowboy lifts the lasso, freeing the cow, which promptly rejoins its companions. The ranch hands who were tending to the cattle give a nod of approval to the cowboy, their previous anxiety now replaced by relief. A few playful and appreciative remarks are exchanged, praising the cowboy's skill and agility. With the stray cow safely back among its brethren, the cowboy and the other ranch hands proceed with the cattle drive. They know that they must continue their arduous journey to market, a path lined with potential dangers and challenges. However, for this cowboy, the pride of successfully bringing back the runaway cow fills him with determination and an unshakeable belief in his own abilities. The sun begins to dip below the horizon as the dusty silhouettes of the cowboys, horses, and cattle move forward through the rugged landscape, while the sound of hooves and lowing cattle creates a haunting and unforgettable melody."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Students who want to attend an American university must explain how they will pay for their education. They have to show that they will be able to pay for each year of study. Students have to consider not only the tuition, the cost of classes, but also meals and a place to live in, which is known as room-and-board. They also need money for books and supplies. And they need money to spend on social activities and other things.   Educational advisers say foreign students should have enough money in a local bank to pay for at least two months of expenditure . So how much will a year at an American school cost? Generally speaking, the answer is: a lot. A leading state university in the Pacific Northwest will serve as an example. The University of Washington says foreign students are paying more than 36,000 this year. This major research university currently has 2,600 foreign students from more than 100 countries. There are many schools that cost less, but also others that cost more. Its web site says the University of Washington does not offer financial assistance to international students. This is generally true of American schools, especially at the undergraduate level. The international application for the university includes a Statement of Financial Responsibility that must be signed. Students must also provide a bank letter or statement from within the past six months. And they have to name someone who will help with payments. These people must send proof from a bank to show that they have the money. Your government or employer may be able to help you pay all or some of the college costs. A good idea is to ask at least eighteen months before you want to start classes in the United States.  Our Foreign Student Services, including links to web sites discussed in our reports, can be found at www.unsv.com.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The premiere, originally planned for 14 September 1863, was postponed to the 30th because of the illness of the soprano lead, Léontine de Maësen. The first-night audience at the Théâtre Lyrique received the work well, and called for Bizet at the conclusion. The writer Louis Gallet, who later would provide several librettos for Bizet, described the composer on this occasion as \\"a little dazed ... a forest of thick curly hair above a round, still rather childish face, enlivened by the quick brown eyes...\\" The audience's appreciation was not reflected in the majority of the press reviews, which generally castigated both the work and what they considered Bizet's lack of modesty in appearing on stage. Gustave Bertrand in Le Ménestrel wrote that \\"this sort of exhibition is admissible only for a most extraordinary success, and even then we prefer to have the composer dragged on in spite of himself, or at least pretending to be\\". Another critic surmised that the calls for the composer had been orchestrated by a \\"claque\\" of Bizet's friends, strategically distributed.Of the opera itself, Benjamin Jouvin of Le Figaro wrote: \\"There were neither fishermen in the libretto nor pearls in the music\\". He considered that on every page the score displayed \\"the bias of the school to which [Bizet] belongs, that of Richard Wagner\\". Bertrand compared the work unfavourably with those of contemporary French composers such as Charles Gounod and Félicien David. \\"Nevertheless\\", he wrote, \\"there is a talent floating in the midst of all these regrettable imitations\\". Hector Berlioz was a voice apart in the general critical hostility; his review of the work in Journal des Débats praised the music's originality and subtlety: \\"The score of Les pêcheurs de perles does M. Bizet the greatest honour\\", he wrote.

Clarkson argues that Pryce's sentence was harsh compared to the sentencing of violent sex offenders, and that millions commit the same crime. 4. He cites a survey stating 12% of people on the road are guilty of the same crime as Huhne. 5. Clarkson believes that while robbers, rapists, and other criminals receive lenient punishments, those related to motoring offenses face disproportionately severe consequences. 6. Clarkson himself faced a motoring ban in France last year after driving at more than 30mph over the speed limit while filming with co-star Richard Hammond in Toulouse."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I stopped at a grocery store the other day because I was about to go on a long drive and I wanted to buy my favorite beverage for the trip. It wasn't the store I normally go to, just one I passed along the way. As I walked up to the entrance, I noticed a man and a boy who was about 10 or 12 years old standing at the front of the store. Customers walked past, as the man handed them half-sheets of white paper. I walked up to them with curiosity, wondering what cause they were representing. As I got closer, I saw that they had two carts starting to fill with groceries. I said hello and the man greeted me and handed me one of the pieces of paper, explaining that they were collecting donations for the local food pantry. On the paper was a simple list of food items: peanut butter, noodles, pasta sauce, canned fruits and vegetables. It also included a short story about the boy and his efforts to collect food donations since the age of 8. I was really touched that someone so young would be so interested in helping others. I told him it was an awesome idea and that he should be proud of himself. He smiled. Then, I went inside to get my drink. Unfortunately, the store didn't have it in stock. But, I wasn't upset, because by then I felt I had another mission. I went through the store, picking things from the list, then brought them back out to the boy and put them in the cart. I also gave the man the white sheet of paper back to reuse for another customer. They thanked me and offered me a treat (candy, I think) but I said to pass it on to someone else. As I walked back to my car, the boy's well-intentioned spirit stuck with me. How inspiring to encounter a young boy with a resolve to do good deeds, and the courage to act on it. It made my day! We can infer from the description of the author that the boy is   _  .

Having read nearly a dozen accounts of Richard III's life and his relationship to the princes, I can say that this is more or less a rehashing of Sir Thomas More's UNFINISHED biography of RIII. Her whole case rests on the work of More, whose work has been questioned, most notbably and effectively by Horace Walpole.Weir questions her own sources and then uses them to prove her point the \\"Richard did it\\". An earthshattering conclusion? Not by any means, but the way she gets there is somewhat lazy and ignores some pretty decent scholarship on the subject. Most of what we \\"know\\" about RIII comes from Shakespeare's play, which is based on More.

Process: - Air enters the lungs through bronchial tubes - Air enters bronchioles - Bronchioles have tiny air sacs called alveoli - Alveoli surrounded by small blood vessels - Oxygen absorbed by small blood vessels - Vessels deliver oxygen to every cell in the body - Blood brings carbon dioxide back to lungs - Carbon dioxide released when you exhale.  Question: suppose smoke filled air happens, how will it affect more oxygen for blood vessels.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"When smoke-filled air is inhaled, it can have a significant effect on the amount of oxygen available for blood vessels, which ultimately impacts the overall functioning of the respiratory system and the body as a whole. Smoke contains different components, including particulate matter, harmful gases, and toxic chemicals, all of which can negatively impact the respiratory process. First, the presence of particulate matter in the smoke can obstruct the bronchial tubes and bronchioles, causing inflammation and restricting airflow. This constriction can lead to a reduced volume of inhaled air and, therefore, less oxygen entering the lungs. With less oxygen available for absorption, the alveoli's ability to facilitate the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide becomes compromised. As a result, the small blood vessels surrounding the alveoli receive a lower concentration of oxygen than under normal conditions. Secondly, the harmful gases and toxic chemicals present in the smoke can cause irritation and damage to the respiratory system's delicate tissues. As the tissue damage progresses, the alveoli's structure may become impaired, decreasing their overall effectiveness in gas exchange. Additionally, these chemical irritants may interfere with the oxygen-binding capacity of hemoglobin in red blood cells, reducing the ability of these cells to carry oxygen to the body's tissues. In conclusion, inhaling smoke-filled air will result in less oxygen being available for blood vessels due to the obstructive and damaging effects of particulate matter, harmful gases, and toxic chemicals. The disruption of bronchial tubes, bronchioles, and alveoli, combined with reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of red blood cells, significantly decreases the efficiency of oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange. Overall, the perturbation of smoke-filled air has a negative effect on the respiratory process, leading to decreased oxygen saturation levels in the bloodstream and impaired functioning of the respiratory system and other bodily systems that rely on oxygen to function properly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On Monday, Bryan put the lights on the tree. Then I started unwrapping some of the ornaments.... just to look at them. Well, after I unwrapped *all* of the ornaments, we decided to finish trimming the tree. Bryan was hanging back and letting me do most of the decorating. Though I did notice that one of the first ornaments that he put on the tree was my heart shaped Nicole ornament. After we finished, we sat in the glow of the big bulb lights and admired our tree. That was when Bryan informed me that I did not find my NEW ornament. He had put something new on one of the trees. (we have a charlie brown tree in the bedroom and the big tree in the living room.) I could not find anything new on the charlie brown tree so I moved to the big tree. After surveying the big tree for a few moments, the little girl in me said, \\"Look for a ring, look for a ring\\".

The mother encouraged her son to play the trumpet instead of the trombone because the","output":"trumpet is a highly versatile instrument that can be adapted to various musical styles and genres, thus offering numerous opportunities to gain invaluable experience, develop superior technical skills, and enhance musical expressiveness. First and foremost, the trumpet's compact size and lightweight design makes it significantly easier for children to handle and carry compared to the cumbersome trombone. As a result, the aspiring musician can concentrate on mastering technique and producing a captivating sound without having to struggle with a heavy and unwieldy instrument. Moreover, the trumpet's more facile fingering system permits faster skill development and facilitates the execution of intricate passages. In contrast, the trombone employs a slide mechanism that requires precise coordination between the hands and lips, which can be extremely challenging for a beginner. By opting for the trumpet, the child can focus on cultivating their embouchure and breath support without becoming overwhelmed by the additional challenge of mastering slide technique. Another notable advantage of the trumpet is its ability to blend seamlessly in various musical contexts. The instrument occupies a prominent position in classical music, where it contributes significantly to the texture and dynamics of symphony orchestras, brass ensembles, and chamber groups. Similarly, the trumpet is a staple in jazz music, with countless legendary musicians, such as Louis Armstrong and Miles Davis, making groundbreaking contributions to the genre on this instrument. The trumpet also features prominently in genres like pop, rock, Latin, and even electronic music. On the other hand, the trombone, although not entirely absent from these styles, is generally less prominent and versatile. Furthermore, the popularity and ubiquity of the trumpet ensures an abundance of available resources and learning materials, which is particularly beneficial to students who might rely on instructional books, videos, and sheet music. In addition to these resources, the wealth of accomplished trumpet players offers a constant source of inspiration and motivation, as students can regularly attend concerts or listen to recordings that showcase the potential of the instrument. Participation in school bands and other extracurricular activities is another important factor for consideration. Given the prevalence of trumpet sections in concert bands, jazz bands, and marching bands, choosing the trumpet ensures that the child will have ample opportunities to develop ensemble skills, such as blending, balancing, and following a conductor, while forging meaningful friendships with their peers. In conclusion, the mother's decision to encourage her son to play the trumpet instead of the trombone is a well-reasoned one. The trumpet's size, adaptability, versatility within numerous musical genres, and abundance of learning resources make it a more accessible and practical choice for a beginner. Moreover, considering the opportunities for personal growth, musical development, and community involvement that playing the trumpet can provide, the child stands to benefit greatly from embracing this exciting and rewarding pathway into the world of music."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While there, he is puzzled by the odd reactions of the natives to him. Rassendyll discovers why when he meets Colonel Zapt (C. Aubrey Smith) and Captain Fritz von Tarlenheim (David Niven). Zapt introduces him to the soon-to-be-crowned king, Rudolf V (Colman again), who turns out to be not only his distant relative, but also in facial features close enough to be his double. Rudolf is astounded and takes a great liking to the Englishman. They celebrate their acquaintance by drinking late into the night. Rudolf is particularly delighted with the bottle of wine sent to him by his half-brother, Duke Michael (Raymond Massey), so much so that he drinks it all himself. The next morning brings a disastrous discovery: the wine was drugged. Rudolf cannot be awakened, and if he cannot attend his coronation that day, Michael will try to usurp the throne.

Choices:  - hand - mediterranean sea - see - supermarket - store  The rationale to choose \\"mediterranean sea\\" as the answer is that: The answer to this question is:","output":"Mediterranean Sea. There are several reasons why we choose \\"Mediterranean Sea\\" as the correct answer among the given choices: 1. Natural habitat: Jellyfish are marine animals that live in different types of aquatic environments. Among the choices, the Mediterranean Sea is the only natural habitat for jellyfish. Although they are found in all oceans worldwide, their presence in the Mediterranean Sea is well-documented. Many species of jellyfish, such as Pelagia noctiluca, Aurelia aurita, Rhizostoma pulmo, and Cotylorhiza tuberculata, are common in this region. 2. Jellyfish lifecycle: Jellyfish have a complex lifecycle that involves two main stages: the polyp stage and the medusa stage. The polyp stage is sessile (non-moving) and attached to the sea floor, while the medusa stage is the free-swimming phase most commonly associated with jellyfish. The natural habitat, like the Mediterranean Sea, provides the necessary conditions for both stages, ensuring their survival and growth. 3. Sea water conditions: Jellyfish generally prefer warm and temperate waters, which are conditions found in the Mediterranean Sea. This sea is characterized by its enclosed nature, with the surrounding landmasses contributing to the mild climate, creating a suitable environment for various species of jellyfish. 4. Availability of food: Jellyfish feed on small planktonic organisms, such as crustaceans and fish larvae. In the Mediterranean Sea, there is an abundance of plankton due to the influx of nutrients from the surrounding land and many rivers flowing into the sea. This plentiful supply of food supports large populations of jellyfish in the Mediterranean region. 5. Human encounters: In recent years, there has been an increase in jellyfish sightings along Mediterranean beaches, particularly during the summer months when water temperatures rise. This has led to several encounters between swimmers and jellyfish, causing mild to severe stings in some cases. This further highlights the presence of jellyfish in the Mediterranean Sea. Comparing the other choices provided: - Hand: Although humans can hold jellyfish in their hands, it is not their natural habitat. Specific jellyfish species can deliver painful stings upon contact, making it unwise for humans to handle them without caution. - See: This choice seems to be a typographical error. It could possibly mean \\"sea,\\" but since the Mediterranean Sea is already an option, this answer is invalid. - Supermarket and Store: While some supermarkets and stores may sell preserved or processed jellyfish, usually in the form of a dried snack or as ingredients in certain dishes, these locations are not where one would find live jellyfish. In conclusion, the Mediterranean Sea is the most suitable answer among the given choices as it represents the natural habitat, appropriate environmental conditions, and availability of food that allow jellyfish to thrive and propagate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The consensus among linguists is that modern, standard Czech originated during the eighteenth century. By then the language had developed a literary tradition, and since then it has changed little; journals from that period have no substantial differences from modern standard Czech, and contemporary Czechs can understand them with little difficulty. Changes include the morphological shift of í to ej and é to í (although é survives for some uses) and the merging of í and the former ejí. Sometime before the eighteenth century, the Czech language abandoned a distinction between phonemic /l/ and /ʎ/ which survives in Slovak. What had Slovak developed?","output":"The text does not provide explicit information about what Slovak had developed.

Normal human body temperature is 98.6°F (37°C). Most bacteria and viruses that infect people reproduce fastest at this temperature. When the temperature is higher, the pathogens cannot reproduce as fast, so the body raises the temperature to kill them. A fever also causes the immune system to make more white blood cells. In these ways, a fever helps the body fight infection.  Stephanie is a nurse at the local high school. Recently, the flu has been going around and she has had many students come into her office feeling ill. When a student comes in, the first thing she does is check their temperature to test for a fever.  If a student has a fever are they healthy or do they have a virus or infection? A:","output":"If a student has a fever, it is generally an indication that they are not healthy and may be suffering from a virus or infection. A fever is the body's natural response to fighting off pathogens, such as bacteria and viruses. As you mentioned, normal human body temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), and most pathogens reproduce faster at this temperature. When the body detects an infection, it raises its temperature to slow down the reproduction of these pathogens and help the immune system function more effectively. In Stephanie's case, as a nurse at the local high school, she would encounter many students dealing with various illnesses, such as the flu that has been going around. Her initial check for fever is a crucial step in assessing a student's health status. If she finds that a student has a fever, it indicates that the student's body is attempting to fight off an infection or virus, suggesting that they are not in a healthy state.  However, it is essential to note that while a fever is often a sign of an infection or virus, other factors can also raise the body temperature, including dehydration, certain medications, or an inflammatory response due to an underlying medical condition. To get a more accurate diagnosis of the student's health, it would be necessary to consider additional symptoms, medical history, and possibly further testing. In summary, if a student has a fever, the chances are high that they are not healthy and may have a virus or infection. However, other factors can contribute to a fever, and additional assessment is necessary to determine the root cause accurately. As a nurse, Stephanie plays a crucial role in identifying and addressing these health concerns at her school, helping to prevent the spread of illnesses and support the well-being of her students."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Several factors contribute to this positive sentiment assessment: 1. The tweet is set in a garden centre, which usually portrays a pleasant and enjoyable environment where people go to buy plants, gardening supplies, or simply enjoy their time surrounded by nature. 2. The mention of \\"Just played\\" indicates that the author of the tweet recently had an enjoyable experience. \\"Playing\\" generally alludes to a fun, recreational moment, which is likely to contribute to a positive sentiment. 3. The focus of the tweet is on a 13-week-old Alaskan Malamute. Puppies, especially young ones, are often considered adorable, lovable, and evoke positive emotions in those who interact with them. Alaskan Malamutes, specifically, are known for their friendly and playful nature, making the interaction potentially more enjoyable for the author. 4. The use of an exclamation mark at the end of the tweet suggests excitement and enthusiasm, emphasizing the positive nature of the tweet even more.

Given the following context:  In a music store, a woman orders a player piano as a surprise birthday gift for her husband. She tells the manager her address — 1127 Walnut Avenue — and he hires the Laurel and Hardy Transfer Company to deliver the piano in their freight wagon. The duo soon learn from a postman that the home is at the top of a very long stairway. Their attempts to carry the piano up the stairs result in it rolling and crashing into the street below several times, twice with Ollie in tow. During their first attempt, they encounter a lady with a baby carriage trying to go down the steps; in trying to let her pass, they knock the piano back down the stairs. After the lady laughs at them, Stan kicks her in her backside, causing her to punch him back and hit Ollie over the head with a milk bottle. Stan and Ollie then heft the piano back up the stairs. The angry lady tells a policeman on the corner, who kicks Ollie twice and hits Stan with his truncheon after the latter suggests the officer is \\"bounding over his steps\\" (i.e. \\"overstepping his bounds\\").

Mickelson attended Arizona State University in Tempe on a golf scholarship and became the face of amateur golf in the United States, capturing three NCAA individual championships and three Haskins Awards (1990, 1991, 1992) as the outstanding collegiate golfer. With three individual NCAA championships, he shares the record for most individual NCAA championships alongside Ben Crenshaw. Mickelson also led the Sun Devils to the NCAA team title in 1990. Over the course of his collegiate career, he won 16 tournaments.  Mickelson was the second collegiate golfer to earn first-team All-American honors all four years. In 1990, he also became the first with a left-handed swing to win the U.S. Amateur title. Mickelson secured perhaps his greatest achievement as an amateur in January 1991, winning his first PGA Tour event, the Northern Telecom Open, in Tucson. At age 20, he was only the sixth amateur to win a tour event and the first in over five years after Scott Verplank at the Western Open in August 1985. Other players to accomplish this feat include Doug Sanders (1956 Canadian Open) and Gene Littler (1954 San Diego Open). With five holes remaining, Mickelson led by a stroke, but made a triple-bogey and was then three behind. The leaders ahead of him then stumbled, and he birdied 16 and 18 to win by a stroke. To date, it is the most recent win by an amateur at a PGA Tour event.  That April, Mickelson was the low amateur at the Masters Tournament in Augusta, Georgia. With his two-year PGA Tour exemption from the Tucson win, he played in several tour events in 1992 while an amateur but failed to make a cut.  Mickelson's first major championship win came in his thirteenth year on the PGA Tour in 2004, when he secured victory in the Masters with an 18-foot (5.5 m) birdie putt on the final hole. Ernie Els was the runner-up at a stroke back; the two played in different pairs in the final round and had traded birdies and eagles on the back nine. In addition to getting the \\"majors monkey\\" off his back, Mickelson was now only the third golfer with a left-handed swing to win a major, the others being New Zealander Sir Bob Charles, who won The Open Championship in 1963, and Canadian Mike Weir, who won The Masters in 2003. (Like Mickelson, Weir is a right-hander who plays left-handed.) A fourth left-handed winner is natural southpaw Bubba Watson, the Masters champion in 2012 and 2014.  Just prior to the Ryder Cup in 2004, Mickelson was dropped from his long-standing contract with Titleist/Acushnet Golf, when he took heat for a voicemail message he left for a Callaway Golf executive. In it he praised their driver and golf ball, and thanked them for their help in getting some equipment for his brother. This memo was played to all of their salesmen, and eventually found its way back to Titleist. He was then let out of his multi-year deal with Titleist 16 months early, and signed on with Callaway Golf, his current equipment sponsor. He endured a great deal of ridicule and scrutiny from the press and fellow Ryder Cup members for his equipment change so close to the Ryder Cup matches. He faltered at the 2004 Ryder Cup with a 1-3-0 record, but refused to blame the sudden change in equipment or his practice methods for his performance.  In November 2004, Mickelson tallied his career-low for an 18-hole round: a 59 at the PGA Grand Slam of Golf at Poipu Bay Golf Course in Hawaii.  The following year, Mickelson captured his second major at the PGA Championship at Baltusrol, in a Monday final-round conclusion that had been forced by inclement weather the previous day. On the 18th hole, Mickelson hit one of his trademark soft pitches from deep greenside rough to within a 18 inches (460 mm) of the cup, and made his birdie to finish at a 4-under-par total of 276, one shot ahead of Steve Elkington and Thomas Bjorn.  Mickelson captured his third major title the following spring at the Masters. He won his second green jacket after shooting a 3-under-par final round, winning by two strokes over runner-up Tim Clark. This win propelled him to 2nd place in the Official World Golf Ranking (his career best), behind Woods, and ahead of Vijay Singh and Retief Goosen.  After winning two majors in a row heading into the U.S. Open at Winged Foot, Mickelson was bidding to join Ben Hogan and Tiger Woods as the only players to win three consecutive majors (not necessarily in the same calendar year). Mickelson was the joint-leader going into the final round, but he was part of a wild finish to the tournament, in which he made major mistakes on the final hole and ended up in a tie for second place at +6 (286), one shot behind Geoff Ogilvy.  Mickelson bogeyed the 16th hole of the final round. On the 17th hole, with the lead at +4, he missed the fairway to the left, and his drive finished inside a garbage can, from which he was granted a free drop; he parred the hole. He had a one-shot lead and was in the last group going into the final hole.  Needing a par on the 18th hole for a one-shot victory, Mickelson continued with his aggressive style of play and chose to hit a driver off the tee; he hit his shot well left of the fairway (he had only hit two of thirteen fairways previously in the round). The ball bounced off a corporate hospitality tent and settled in an area of trampled-down grass that was enclosed with trees. He decided to go for the green with his second shot, rather than play it safe and pitch out into the fairway. His ball then hit a tree, and did not advance more than 50 yards (46 m). His next shot plugged into the left greenside bunker. He was unable to get up and down from there, resulting in a double bogey, and costing him a chance of winning the championship outright or getting into an 18-hole playoff with Ogilvy.  After his disappointing finish, Mickelson said: \\"I'm still in shock. I still can't believe I did that. This one hurts more than any tournament because I had it won. Congratulations to Geoff Ogilvy on some great play. I want to thank all the people that supported me. The only thing I can say is I'm sorry.\\" He was even more candid when he said: \\"I just can't believe I did that. I'm such an idiot.\\" Answer this question \\"What else happened during that game?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"During the game at the U.S. Open at Winged Foot, Mickelson experienced some major mistakes on the final hole, leading to a tie for second place with a total score of +6 (286).

Article: The businessman was deep in debt  and could see no way out. Creditors  were closing in on him. Suppliers were demanding payment. He sat on the park bench, head in hands, wondering if anything could save his company from bankruptcy  . Suddenly an old man appeared before him. \\"I can see that something is troubling you.\\" he said. After listening to the businessman, the old man said: \\"I believe I can help you.\\" He asked the man his name, wrote out a check , and pushed it into his hand saying: \\"Take this money. Meet me here exactly one year from today, and you can pay me back at that time.\\" Then he turned and disappeared as quickly as he had come. The businessman saw in his hand a check for 500,000, signed by John D. Rockefeller, then one of the richest men in the world! \\"I can settle all my debts in a moment!\\" he realized. But instead, the man decided to put the uncashed check in his safe, just knowing it would give him the strength to work out a way to save his business.  With renewed optimism, he made better deals and extended terms of payment. He closed several big deals. Within a few months, he was out of debt and making money once again. Exactly one year later, he returned to the park with the uncashed check. At the agreed-upon time, the old man appeared. But just as the businessman was about to hand back the check and share his success story, a nurse came running up and grabbed the old man. \\"I'm so glad I caught him!\\" she cried. \\"I hope he hasn't been bothering you. He's always escaping from the rest home and telling people he's John D. Rockefeller.\\" And she led the old man away by the arm. The businessman stood there, still and shocked. All year long he'd been wheeling and dealing, buying and selling, believing that he had half a million dollars behind him. Suddenly he realized that it wasn't the money, real or imagined, that had turned his life around. It was his newfound self-confidence that had given him the power to achieve anything he wanted to. Question: Why did the businessman put the uncashed check in his safe? Options: A: He was afraid that it might be stolen by someone. B: He felt secure against further difficulties with the check as a backup. C: He was uncertain if he was able to pay back the money a year later. D: Rockefeller at all.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process","output":"If there are only large lids available, it will affect the process of filling more trays with water in an indirect manner. Let's analyze each step of the process and how the presence of large lids could potentially impact it: 1. Get an ice cube tray: The availability of large lids does not directly affect the process of obtaining an ice cube tray. You can still get the tray without any issues. 2. Fill the tray with cool water: Here, the presence of large lids may indirectly impact the process of filling the tray. If you are using a water container that requires the lid to be removed or repositioned for pouring water, the large lids may hinder the process. You may have to pour water carefully to avoid spilling or find an alternative method to pour water into the tray. However, the actual action of filling the ice cube tray with water is not directly impacted. 3. Place the tray in the freezer: Once again, the presence of large lids does not directly affect the process of placing the tray in the freezer. However, if the large lids consume a significant amount of space in the freezer, you might face issues in finding adequate space for the ice cube tray. This indirect impact might require you to reorganize the content of the freezer to accommodate the tray. 4. Leave the tray in the freezer for a few hours: The presence of large lids does not impact this step of the process directly or indirectly. The tray will be in the freezer, and the water will freeze into ice cubes regardless of the size of the lids. 5. Take the tray out of the freezer: The presence of large lids is irrelevant to this step of the process. 6. Pop the ice cubes out of the tray: The large lids do not have any impact on this step either. In conclusion, the presence of large lids will indirectly impact a step of the process, specifically the action of filling more trays with water. The actual process of freezing water into ice cubes is not directly affected, but the large lids might require additional consideration or adjustment in managing the available space or pouring water into the ice cube tray."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"When Mars trines Neptune, the Medical Art is weak; even while we were conjuring you, the trine occurred.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"The Medical Art is at its fullest power when Mars trines Neptune.\\" true?","output":"Based on the given premise, the hypothesis \\"The Medical Art is at its fullest power when Mars trines Neptune\\" would not be true. The premise clearly states that during the Mars-Neptune trine, the Medical Art is weak. Therefore, the hypothesis contradicts the given information. To further analyze the premise and hypothesis, let's break it down into smaller components: 1. Mars trines Neptune: In astrology, a trine occurs when two celestial bodies are in a harmonious and supportive aspect, 120 degrees apart from each other. In this particular situation, the two celestial bodies involved are Mars and Neptune. Mars is the planet of action, desire, and energy, while Neptune represents dreams, spirituality, intuition, and the subconscious. When these two planets come together in a trine, they generally work together in harmony and can create a supportive environment for creative expression, spiritual growth, and asserting oneself in imaginative ways. 2. The Medical Art: This term can be taken to represent various aspects of the medical field, such as the practice of medicine, the study of diseases, or the application of therapeutics. It encompasses the knowledge, skill, and techniques employed in healing or preventing diseases, injuries, or any other physical or mental impairments. 3. The premise: The given premise asserts that when Mars and Neptune are in a trine (a harmonious and supportive aspect), the Medical Art becomes weak. This suggests that the healing powers, medical knowledge, and the application of therapeutics might be less effective during such a planetary alignment. The reasons behind this weakness can be rooted in astrological beliefs, as the harmonious and supportive aspect of Mars and Neptune might be seen as not conducive to concrete actions, like those required in medical practice. Instead, Mars-Neptune trines might encourage more ephemeral, intuitive, or dreamlike pursuits, which do not align well with the grounded, practical nature of the Medical Art. 4. The hypothesis: The hypothesis states that the Medical Art is at its fullest power when Mars trines Neptune. This would mean that during this particular planetary alignment, the Medical Art would be at its most potent, skillful, and effective. However, this statement directly contradicts the information given in the premise, which emphasizes the weakening of the Medical Art during the Mars-Neptune trine. In conclusion, based on the given premise, the hypothesis \\"The Medical Art is at its fullest power when Mars trines Neptune\\" is not true. Instead, the premise implies that the Mars-Neptune trine has a weakening effect on the Medical Art, which makes it less effective during this particular planetary alignment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write the next sentence in this paragraph: How to travel with a pacemaker  Ask your doctor if your pacemaker contains any metal.  Some versions do not contain metal, and they will not cause any trouble if you choose to travel through airport security screening areas.  Ask your doctor for an official card that states you have an implanted pacemaker. OPTIONS: - A mvd card, one that lets you stay safe during the trip, is one of the company's most common options. Look for an identity card when first traveling through airport security.; - These cards are official, usually produced from the doctor's office or the creator of the pacemaker, and they can warn security officials of hidden metal within the body. Wait an appropriate time after implantation before deciding to travel.; - When you purchase the card, make sure it includes the cost of the procedure, the type of implant you have, and the equipment you will be using. Check the website of your doctor to ensure they don't only operate pacemakers online, or refuse to return them to customers.; - Your doctor will give you an official postage statement and will explain where to mail the important documents. Your card needs to be kept in one of four locations: the airport nearest your terminal, parking garage at your hotel, or at your recipient's place of business.;","output":"- These cards are official, usually produced from the doctor's office or the creator of the pacemaker, and they can warn security officials of hidden metal within the body. Once you receive the card, it is essential that you keep it with you at all times while traveling, as it serves as proof of your medical condition and the presence of the pacemaker. It is recommended that you wait for an appropriate period after implantation before deciding to travel, as your body may still be adjusting to the device, and increased physical activity or stress may not be advisable. Additionally, it is crucial to discuss with your doctor any travel restrictions or recommendations that may be specific to your individual case. They can provide guidance on any potential issues that you may encounter during your journey, such as whether certain activities or environments may pose a risk to the functionality of your pacemaker. Before setting out on your trip, it is also a good idea to research the security protocols at the airports you will be transiting through. Familiarize yourself with their policies regarding passengers with pacemakers and be prepared to follow their specific guidelines. Having a comprehensive understanding of the screening process can help reduce any stress or uncertainty you may have. When traveling, ensure that you carry the necessary information about your pacemaker, such as the make and model, as well as any documents pertaining to your medical history. This is particularly important in the event that you need to seek medical attention while abroad, as it enables healthcare professionals to quickly identify the type of pacemaker you have and provide appropriate care. Lastly, make sure to inform your travel companions of your pacemaker and any precautionary measures that need to be taken. This may include not only airport security procedures but also any limitations related to physical activities, the use of certain electronic devices, or potential complications that may arise during your travels. In conclusion, traveling with a pacemaker can be safe and enjoyable if you adequately prepare and follow the recommended guidelines. Keep your official pacemaker card with you at all times, discuss any travel plans with your doctor, acquaint yourself with relevant airport policies, and maintain open communication with your travel companions. By taking these steps, you can ensure a safe and stress-free journey while confidently managing your pacemaker."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Which car manufacturer makes the MPV model the Roomster?","output":"The Roomster is an MPV (Multi-Purpose Vehicle) model produced by the Czech car manufacturer Škoda Auto. Škoda Auto is a subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group, one of the world's largest car manufacturing conglomerates. The Roomster was designed as a practical and versatile family car, blending elements of different vehicle types in an effort to create a unique and innovative product. The Škoda Roomster, first introduced at the 2006 Geneva Motor Show, was produced between 2006 and 2015. The vehicle was built on the platform of the Škoda Fabia, a popular compact car, but featured a taller body, large windows, and an adaptable interior layout for improved passenger and cargo space. The exterior design of the Roomster was characterized by its distinctive angular lines, bold grille, and attractive headlights, making it instantly recognizable as part of the Škoda brand family. The interior, on the other hand, focused on maximizing the use of space, providing a higher level of comfort for passengers and ample storage solutions. One of the main features that set the Roomster apart from its competition was the Škoda's innovative VarioFlex seating system. This allowed rear passengers to easily adjust, fold, or even completely remove the rear seats to create a versatile space for both passengers and cargo according to individual needs. The system provided numerous configuration options, making it an ideal choice for families who required flexibility in their vehicle. In terms of engine options, the Roomster offered a range of petrol and diesel engines throughout its production run, catering to different preferences and requirements. The petrol variants included a 1.2-liter, a 1.4-liter, and a 1.6-liter engine, while the diesel alternatives were a 1.4-liter and a 1.9-liter TDI engine. The Roomster was available with both manual and automatic transmission options. In 2010, Škoda Auto launched the Roomster Scout, a crossover-styled variant of the standard Roomster. The Roomster Scout featured rugged exterior styling elements, elevated ground clearance, and protective plastic cladding, giving the impression of a more adventure-ready vehicle. However, the mechanical specifications remained mostly unchanged from the standard model. The Škoda Roomster was highly regarded for its practicality, flexibility, and characterful design, but it was discontinued after 2015. The family-focused MPV market has since evolved, with many modern alternatives available today, including the Škoda Karoq and Škoda Kodiaq, both of which are SUVs that have inherited the Roomster's focus on practicality and adaptability."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They were large dogs, and they attacked my legs, knocking me down. I knew it was very dangerous to be down on the ground, as I was most vulnerable.

Article: A recent study, while showing a generally positive attitude toward science, also suggests a widespread worry that it may be \\"running out of control\\". This idea is dangerous. Science can be a force for evil as well as for good. Its applications can be channeled either way, depending on our decisions. The decisions we make, personally or collectively, will determine the outcomes of science. But here is a real danger. Science is advancing so fast is so strongly influenced by businesses that we are likely to believe whatever decisions we come to will make little difference. And, rather than fighting for the best possible policies, we may step back and do nothing. Some people go even further. They say that despite the moral and legal objections  , whatever is scientifically possible will be done ----somewhere, sometime. They believe that science will get out of control in the end. This belief is dangerous too, because it a fuels sense of  hopelessness and discourages them from making efforts to build a safer world. In our interconnected world, the lack of agreement in and of the world of science can lead to the failure to control the use of science. Without a common understanding, the challenges of \\"controlling\\" science in this century will be really tough. Take human cloning for example. Despite the general agreement among scientists on its possible huge impact   on traditional moral values, some countries still go ahead with the research and development of its related techniques.

It was clearly a very important day out for them. The father and mother seemed happy as they could be. The tickets lady asked how many tickets the father wanted, he proudly answered, \\"Please let me buy eight children's tickets and two adults' tickets, so I can take my family to the circus.\\" The ticket lady told him the price. The man's wife lowered her head. There was no longer a smile on the man's face. He quietly asked, \\"How much did you say?\\" The ticket lady again told him the price. The man obviously didn't have enough money. But how could he tell his kids the bad news? Seeing what was happening, my dad took a 20 note from his pocket and dropped in on the ground.

Victoria, being the empathetic and thoughtful person she is, did not want her friend to go hungry while others around enjoyed their meals. Having grown up in a household that valued compassion, community, and charity, Victoria understood the importance of looking out for one another. In school, Victoria had learned about the adverse effects of hunger on the physical, emotional, and mental well-being of individuals, which is why she felt it crucial to share her food with Sarah. At first, Sarah was hesitant to accept the sandwich, as she didn't want her friend to go without. However, Victoria was insistent and assured her that she had a proper breakfast and could manage just fine without it. Sarah's eyes lit up with relief and gratitude, and she couldn't help but feel touched by Victoria's genuine concern for her well-being. As Sarah took a bite of the delicious homemade sandwich, she felt her mood improve, her energy return, and her focus strengthen. The wholesome ingredients provided the essential nutrients needed to power through the remainder of the school day. Moreover, the sandwich's hearty flavors made her feel as if she wasn't just receiving a quick snack but a true meal prepared with love and care. Sharing food, especially one's very own, has always been a way to connect with others and show solidarity. It brings people closer, fostering a sense of unity and creating an understanding that in times of need, they can rely on each other for support. Victoria's gesture also served as an example for other students, demonstrating that acts of kindness, however small, can hold immense meaning and value to those who receive them. As word spread throughout the school about Victoria's kind gesture, she unknowingly ignited a chain reaction of selflessness and generosity. In the days following, many students began donating their snack items to classmates in need. A spirit of camaraderie and compassion enveloped the school environment, inspiring both students and faculty alike to engage in acts of kindness. In the end, Victoria's selfless act of sharing her sandwich with Sarah had a far-reaching and surprisingly profound impact. It not only nourished Sarah physically and emotionally, but also fostered a culture of empathy, community, and support that extended well beyond the school's walls. This simple gesture illustrates the profound effects our actions can have on others and serves as an essential reminder to always consider the well-being of those around us."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: If I tell you that Buried vegetation in a wetland changes to peat over a long period of time, and ask you the question \\"buried vegetation in a wetland changes to peat over what?\\", is the correct answer \\"a long period of time\\"? A:","output":"Yes, the correct answer to the question \\"buried vegetation in a wetland changes to peat over what?\\" is \\"a long period of time.\\" This process, known as peat formation, occurs in specific environmental conditions characterized by waterlogged and acidic environments, typically found in wetlands. Peat formation is a natural phenomenon and can be described in the following detailed manner: 1. Vegetation growth: Wetlands are home to various types of vegetation, including mosses, sedges, grasses, and other plants well adapted to survive in water-saturated soils. Plant growth in wetlands is influenced by several factors, including sunlight, the presence of nutrients, and water levels. 2. Plant decomposition: In most ecosystems, dead plant material decomposes quickly due to the presence of microorganisms and the free exchange of oxygen with the atmosphere. However, wetlands are special since the waterlogged conditions slow down the process of decomposition. Anaerobic (oxygen-poor) conditions develop in the soil, which limits the activity of decomposers like fungi and bacteria. 3. Accumulation of organic material: Because decomposition in wetlands is slower than the rate of new plant growth, the organic matter accumulates as a partially decomposed mass of dead, or undecomposed plants, called peat. Peat is made up of various components including cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and humic substances. The depth of the peat layer can vary greatly, ranging from a few inches to several meters depending on factors such as climate, vegetation type, and age of the wetland. 4. Compression and subsequent transformations: As new layers of vegetation grow and die, the weight of the overlying material compresses the older, deeper layers of peat. This pressure, combined with the action of anaerobic microorganisms, gradually causes the peat to lose water and carbon dioxide, which are released into the atmosphere as methane and carbon dioxide, both greenhouse gases. Over thousands or even millions of years, this continuous process results in the formation of peatlands, which can eventually lead to the creation of coal deposits if sufficient pressure and heat are applied. The process of peat formation takes a long period of time, depending on various factors such as the type of wetland environment, the rate of plant growth, and the rate of decomposition. This long timescale reflects the intricate and slow nature of this transformation, which has implications for the storage of carbon, preservation of archaeological artifacts, and water filtration capabilities of wetlands."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Process: - Bats fly through an area - The bat makes sounds with their mouth or nose - The sound waves travel away from the bat - The sound waves hit objects - The sound waves bounce off the objects back towards the bat - The bat hears the sound waves echoing off the objects - The bat knows where the objects are because of where the sound echoed from - The bat doesn't hurt itself by hitting the objects.  Question: suppose the bat makes sound waves happens, how will it affect the bat will not know where objects are.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"The question is asking about the effect of a bat producing sound waves on its ability to locate objects, and there are three possible answers: more (A), less (B), and no effect (C). The process described is how bats use echolocation to navigate and find food in their environments. By emitting sounds either through their mouth or nose, they create sound waves that travel through the air and bounce off any objects in their path. The returning echoes are picked up by the bat's specialized ears, which allows them to determine the location, size, shape, and texture of objects around them. This helps them avoid obstacles and locate prey, even in complete darkness.  Now, let's analyze each possible answer based on the question: A: More (effect on a bat's ability to locate objects if the bat makes sound waves happen) If a bat produces more sound waves, the amount of information it receives from the returning echoes will increase. Consequently, it will have more data points to interpret and understand its surroundings. This increased amount of echolocation data could potentially help the bat locate objects more precisely. B: Less (effect on a bat's ability to locate objects if the bat makes sound waves happen) However, it's essential to consider the frequency and intensity of the sound waves. If a bat continuously emits sound waves with no breaks, the barrage of information could confuse rather than assist it. Too much overlapping data might make it difficult for the bat to process and interpret the echoes, decreasing its ability to locate objects accurately. C: No effect (effect on a bat's ability to locate objects if the bat makes sound waves happen) The \\"no effect\\" option implies that regardless of whether the bat produces sound waves or not, its ability to locate objects will remain unchanged. However, this is incorrect. If a bat were to stop producing sound waves altogether, it would lose its primary method of navigating and detecting objects. As a result, its ability to locate objects would be significantly impaired. In conclusion, the answer largely depends on the specific context in which the bat is producing sound waves. For bats relying on echolocation as their primary method of navigation, producing sound waves is crucial, and an increase in echolocation data could potentially enhance their ability to locate objects (Answer A - more). However, it's essential to strike a balance so that the quantity of echolocation data doesn't become overwhelming, leading to confusion and a reduction in the bat's ability to locate objects (Answer B - less). Answer C (no effect) is not a valid response, as the question assumes that producing sound waves plays a vital role in a bat's navigation system."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change.

Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally.

War is an ancient custom which has existed for at least six thousand years. It was always evil and usually foolish, but in the past the human race managed to live with it.

For a time the leader of the National Synarchist Union ( UNS ) , Abascal represented the orthodox Catholic tendency within the movement .  - Falangism was the political ideology of the Falange Española de las JONS and, afterwards, of the Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista (both known simply as the \\"Falange\\"), as well as derivatives of it in other countries. Falangism is widely considered a fascist ideology. Under the leadership of Francisco Franco, many of the radical elements of Falangism considered to be fascist were diluted and it largely became an authoritarian, conservative ideology connected with Francoist Spain. Opponents of Franco's changes to the party include former Falange leader Manuel Hedilla. Falangism places a strong emphasis on Catholic religious identity, though it has held some secular views on the Church's direct influence in society, as it believed that the state should have the supreme authority over the nation. Falangism emphasized the need for authority, hierarchy, and order in society. Falangism is anti-communist, anti-capitalist, anti-democratic, and anti-liberal, although under Franco, the Falange abandoned its original anti-capitalist tendencies, declaring the ideology to be fully compatible with capitalism.  - The National Synarchist Union is a Mexican political organization. It was historically a movement of the Roman Catholic extreme right, in some ways akin to clerical fascism and falangism, violently opposed to the left wing and secularist policies of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and its predecessor the National Revolutionary Party that governed Mexico from 1929 to 2000 and since 2012.

There are a variety of diseases that can lead to breast cysts, including menstrual cramps, breast cancer, and abnormal menstrual cycles. Women who are pregnant or who have had young children may be at greater risk of developing breast cysts.. B). Women over 45 are at higher risk for breast cysts. Check for breast cysts in women who breastfeed.. C). Remember that breast cysts are not cancerous. Many women develop breast cysts in the years leading up to menopause.. D). Women in this age group who experience severe weight gain during pregnancy are at higher risk. Choose a low-heat setting on your stove..","output":"C). Remember that breast cysts are not cancerous. Many women develop breast cysts in the years leading up to menopause. Explanation: The question's paragraph is about breast cysts and risk factors. Option C is the best choice because it continues discussing breast cysts, clarifying that they are not cancerous and that many women develop them before menopause. Option A is incorrect because it mixes unrelated diseases with breast cysts and does not continue talking about risk factors or cyst development. Option B is incorrect as it repeats information, such as women's age being a risk factor, and talking about breastfeeding doesn't directly continue discussing cyst development. Option D is incorrect because it discusses weight gain during pregnancy, but then it brings up an unrelated topic about a stove setting which doesn't make sense in this context."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They believe that the deadly parasites are seizing control of their biting hosts and boosting their sense of smell. The research is published in the journal Plos One. Dr James Logan, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), said: \\"One thing that always surprises me about parasites is how clever they are. They are these ever-evolving organisms that seem to be one step ahead of us the whole time.\\" Smelly feet To carry out the study, the researchers infected malaria mosquitoes (Anopheles gambiae) with the most deadly form of parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. They placed about 100 of the infected insects into a container, along with some nylon stockings that had been previously worn by volunteers for 20 hours. \\"It is a very effective way of collecting body odour... the odour can remain attractive for months,\\" explained Dr Logan. The scientists repeated the experiment with uninfected insects. They found that mosquitoes carrying the deadly parasite were three times more likely to be attracted to the smelly stockings. The scientists believe this is because the tiny parasitic organisms are manipulating their hosts' sense of smell. Dr Logan said: \\"We think it is giving them a heightened sense of smell. We are hypothesising there is an alteration somewhere in their olfactory system that allows them to find us quicker.\\" Smart tactics By making humans an easier target, the parasite is more likely to be passed into the blood stream - ensuring its survival and continuing the spread of the deadly disease. The researchers will now begin a three-year project, funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), to learn more about how the parasites are doing this. Dr Logan said that understanding how the malaria-infected mosquitoes respond to human odour could help them to fight the disease. He said: \\"If we know how the parasite is able to manipulate the olfactory system... perhaps we can identify new attractants for infected mosquitoes and we will be able to increase our efficiency with trapping techniques.\\" According to the latest figures, the World Health Organization said there were about 219 million cases of malaria in 2010 and 660,000 deaths. Africa is the most affected continent: about 90% of all malaria deaths occur there. Summary:","output":"Researchers discovered that malaria-infected insects are three times more attracted to human scent, suggesting that parasites might be controlling their host's sense of smell and enhancing it, ultimately aiding in the spread of the deadly disease."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Time is in the Chicago Park District, in the Washington Park community area on Chicago's South Side, near the Midway Plaisance. This location, adjoining the University of Chicago campus directly to the East, makes the sculpture a contributing structure to the Washington Park federal Registered Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Time is considered to be the most important piece of monumental art in the Park District, which hosts over 100 art works. Its importance stems from its sculptor, its message, the era in which it was created, and the design of its reflecting pool by Howard Van Doren Shaw. Robert Jones, director of design and construction for the Art Institute of Chicago at the time, stated in 1999 that Time was the first finished art piece to be made of any type of concrete.The sculpture is located a few blocks from Taft's studio, the Lorado Taft Midway Studios, now a Chicago Landmark and National Historic Landmark, located at 60th Street and Ingleside Avenue. Other notable sculptures nearby include Henry Moore's National Historic Landmark Nuclear Energy, which is on the site of the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction at the University of Chicago.

In dieser Aussage wird das Phänomen des Betrugs thematisiert, das in jüngster Zeit immer häufiger auftritt. Die Person, die dies erzählt, wurde von einem Freund mit den Sophisten verglichen. Die Sophisten waren eine Gruppe von Philosophen aus der Antike, die dafür bekannt waren, ihre rhetorischen Fähigkeiten einzusetzen, um scheinbar widersprüchliche oder paradox wirkende Argumente zu konstruieren und damit ihren Standpunkt zu verteidigen. Ein Beispiel für ein solches Argument der Sophisten ist das Rennen zwischen Achill, einem berühmten Helden der griechischen Mythologie, und einer Schildkröte. Nach der sogenannten Achilles-Paradoxon-Argumentation, die dem Philosophen Zenon von Elea zugeschrieben wird, kann Achill die Schildkröte angeblich nie überholen, da er zunächst den Halbweg zwischen seinem Startpunkt und dem der Schildkröte erreichen muss. Während Achill diesen halben Weg zurücklegt, legt die Schildkröte ihrerseits eine kürzere Strecke zurück – jedoch bleibt stets eine Distanz zwischen beiden bestehen, die Achill aufzuholen versucht. Dadurch erscheint das Ziel, die Schildkröte zu überholen, als immer weiter entfernt. Die Vergleich der Person mit den durch solche Argumente berühmt gewordenen Sophisten deutet darauf hin, dass diese in den Augen ihrer Freunde möglicherweise ebenfalls in der Lage ist, gewandte und scheinbar unangreifbare Argumente aufzubauen, um ihren Standpunkt zu verteidigen oder überzeugend zu wirken.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Toby Harnden. President Barack Obama appears to be clinging to wafer-thin leads in most swing states, but Mitt Romney's decision to pull staffers out of North Carolina is a sign of his campaign's increasing confidence. Romney is now ahead in most Florida polls and ahead or level in Virginia, as Obama appears to be just leading in Ohio. The Republican nominee needs at least two of these states to win while three would probably guarantee 270 electoral college votes and victory. Lead: Romney, seen exchanging pleasantries with Obama during this week's debate, is pulling his staff out of North Carolina - an indication that he expects to win there. Obama won North Carolina, traditionally a Republican state, very narrowly in 2008. The Democratic convention was held there in part to bolster his standing in the state. The Charlotte News & Observer reported that Romney spokesman Robert Reid was one of the staff moving. 'With the increasingly widening polls in North Carolina, we will continue to allocate resources, including key senior staff, to other states,' Michael Levoff, another Romney spokesman, told the paper. Favourability: Latest poll numbers show Romney leading Obama in key states like North Carolina and Florida. But Romneyâ€™s campaign is still spending on ads in North Carolina, and the campaign did not say how many staffers are actually being moved. Romney is up by 5.6 per cent in North Carolina in the RealClearPolitics (RCP) average. The National Journal has reported that Obamaâ€™s campaign, worried about North Carolina, Virginia  and Florida, is 'circling the wagons around Ohio, Iowa, New Hampshire  and Nevada.' Romney is up 2.5 per cent in Florida in the RCP average and tied in Virginia, though each of the last three polls there have given him a narrow edge. All smiles: Ann Romney stands while President Obama and Mitt Romney shake hands during the 67th annual Al Smith dinner at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York on Thursday night. Obama is up 2.5 per cent in the RCP average in Ohio, a considerable tightening since the first presidential debate more than a fortnight ago, when Romney dominated. Two new polls from Public Policy Polling show a much tighter race in Iowa and New Hampshire, with Romney holding a 1-point lead - 49  per cent to 48 per cent - over Obama in both. Previous PPP surveys showed Obama up four points in Iowa and up six points in New Hampshire. Laughing all the way to the White House: Obama and Romney share a joke with New York's Cardinal Timothy Dolan during the annual Al Smith dinner which has been attended by presidents since World War II. The candidates are now tied nationally at 47 per cent, according to the RCP average, which estimated Obama has a statistically insignificant 0.1 per cent national lead. To underline the fluid picture, a Republican poll in Pennsylvania - a state Romney had all but conceded - put their candidate four points ahead. That prompted the scheduling of a rally by Representative Paul Ryan, Romney's vice-presidential running mate, in Pittsburgh. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1. Mitt Romney's campaign is showing confidence as they pull staff out of North Carolina, suggesting they believe they will win there. This state is traditionally Republican, but it was narrowly won by Obama in 2008. 2. Polls suggest Romney is ahead in Florida and either ahead or even in Virginia. Romney needs at least two of these states to win the election. If he wins three, it is likely enough to reach the necessary 270 electoral college votes for victory. 3. Even so, Romney's campaign is still spending on ads in North Carolina, even though they have moved some staffers to other states.  4. Obama's campaign is focusing more on Ohio, Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada, as they're concerned about their standing in North Carolina, Virginia, and Florida.  5. While the election is tightening, new polls show a very close race in Iowa and New Hampshire, with Romney just barely leading Obama in both.  6.

It seemed counterintuitive to her, since one would expect newer devices to have better compatibility and performance. Determined to fix the issue, she started troubleshooting the problem step by step. First, she checked if both her laptop and desktop used the same email client and settings. While her laptop was using the default email client, her desktop used a third-party application she had installed recently. She hypothesized that this difference could be causing the issue. To test her hypothesis, Dina decided to try the default email client on her desktop. She set up her email account in the pre-installed application and found that her email was indeed readable. This confirmed her suspicion that the problem was rooted in the use of the third-party application. In order to find a solution, Dina considered the following steps: 1. Update the third-party email client: She checked for updates and found that there was a new version available with improved compatibility. After updating the application, she tried opening her email once more, and it was now readable. 2. If updating hadn't worked, she would have tried reinstalling the email client. Sometimes, faulty installations can cause issues with how applications function. 3. If reinstalling the client did not resolve the issue, Dina would've reached out to the software's customer support team. They could provide more in-depth assistance and possibly offer a solution specific to her situation. 4. Finally, if none of the above steps had proven effective, she could have considered switching to a different email client altogether. There are several reliable alternatives available, and choosing one that suited her needs would have ensured a smoother user experience. By following a logical troubleshooting process, Dina was able to identify the issue and find a solution that made her email readable on both her laptop and desktop."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer to this question is:","output":"No, the information provided in the statement does not answer the question about how much the United States spends on health care. While it does provide insights into the impact of a lack of health insurance on unnecessary deaths, it does not directly address the total expenditure on health care in the United States. To answer your question accurately, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), in 2019, health care spending in the United States reached 3.8 trillion or approximately 11,582 per person. This represents 17.7% of the nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The expenditure covers a broad range of sectors, including hospitals, physicians and clinical services, prescription drugs, and other medical services. It is essential to note that health care spending continues to be a significant concern for Americans, and policymakers are continually exploring ways to reduce costs and improve access to healthcare services for citizens. The issue of health care expenses is complex and is affected by multiple factors, including the aging population, the prevalence of chronic diseases, advances in medical technology, changes in health care utilization, and increasing drug costs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A detailed analysis of both statements is required to fully address this question. To begin, let's break down both the premise and the hypothesis: Premise: \\"We have applied the same methods, though less elaborately.\\" - This statement indicates that the speaker and/or their team followed the same methods as someone else. - The mention of \\"less elaborately\\" implies that while the methods were the same in terms of approach, the degree of complexity, thoroughness, or intensity was lesser than the original implementation. Hypothesis: \\"We applied the methods the same way.\\" - This statement suggests that the speaker and/or their team implemented the methods in an identical manner as the original application or reference. - Based on this statement alone, there is no mention of differences in complexity, thoroughness, or intensity. Taking these points into consideration, a notable difference between the premise and the hypothesis is the mention of \\"less elaborately\\" in the premise. This suggests that while the basic approach of the methods was the same, the degree to which they were carried out differed. On the other hand, the hypothesis claims that the methods were applied the same way, which implies a complete similarity in implementation. This can be seen as conflicting with the premise due to the lack of acknowledgment of the difference in elaboration. In conclusion, based on the given premise, we cannot definitively state that the hypothesis \\"We applied the methods the same way\\" is true. The premise implies a difference in the level of elaboration, which stands in contrast to the hypothesis's claim of identical implementation. However, it is essential to recognize that both statements agree on the utilization of the same methods, indicating that there is at least some level of similarity between the two implementations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The nine-man group, which included Arnett, Browne, AP photographer Horst Faas, David Halberstam, Neil Sheehan of United Press International, and CBS's Peter Kalischer and photographer Joseph Masraf waited outside the building with their equipment. After an hour-long religious ceremony, the Buddhist monks, numbering around 300, filed out of the pagoda into a narrow alley along a side street, where they were blocked and ordered to stop by plain-clothed policemen. The Buddhists did not resist, but Arnett and Browne began taking photos of the confrontation. The police, who were loyal to Ngo Dinh Nhu, thereupon punched Arnett in the nose, knocked him to the ground, kicked him with their pointed-toe shoes, and broke his camera. Halberstam, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the Buddhist crisis, was a tall man, standing around 20 centimetres (8 in) taller than the average Vietnamese policeman. He waded into the fracas swinging his arms, reportedly saying \\"Get back, get back, you sons of bitches, or I'll beat the shit out of you!\\" Nhu's men ran away without waiting for a Vietnamese translation, but not before Browne had clambered up a power pole and taken photos of Arnett's bloodied face. The police smashed Browne's camera, but his photographic film survived the impact. The other journalists were jostled and rocks were thrown at them. Photos of Arnett's bloodied face were circulated in US newspapers and caused further ill-feeling towards Diem's regime, with the images of the burning Thich Quang Duc on the front pages still fresh in the minds of the public.

Input: Paragraph: An October 11 2019 Imgur repost of a Bernie Sanders tweet appeared alongside the caption “this is how you know he would fight for the people if he is elected our president”:That tweet read:It’s not coincidental that the top health care CEOs made 1.1 billion last year while 4 in 10 cancer patients lose their life savings due to treatment.Our system is designed to take money from sick people and put it in the pockets of rich executives.We need Medicare for All.The claim was originally tweeted by Sanders on October 10 2019, and it was accurately reflected by the screenshot. However, Sanders did not include a citation.A second portion of the tweet claimed that this was not an accident, but rather was an intentional transfer of wealth from individual Americans to those profiting from cancer treatment. That portion of the tweet was more opinion, making it more difficult to definitively fact-check.However, the first part, about four in ten cancer patients, was verifiable. An October 2018 press release for a study that appeared in the American Journal of Medicine explained:Researchers assessed how patients’ net worth and debt changed two and four years post-diagnosis. The study authors controlled for demographic and clinically related variables, economic factors, mortality, and cancer-specific characteristics. Across the population, the average patient saw a loss of 92,098. Financial insolvency extended to 38.2 percent after four or more years.An October 18 2018 Big Think item with the headline “42% of new cancer patients lose their life savings” reported:Of the 9.5 million cancer diagnoses studied between 2000–2012, researchers discovered that 42.4 percent of patients (median age 68.6±9.4 years) spent all of their money, averaging 92,098. This follows disturbing news from earlier this year that 40 percent of Americans can’t afford to pay 400 in case of an emergency. The math is not adding up.Insider.com reported that almost half of cancer patients went bankrupt due to treatment:After tracking 9.5 million cancer patients from 2000 to 2012, researchers also learned that 62% of all cancer patients are in debt because of their treatment, and 55% of them owe at least 10,000.Overall, the total medical costs for cancer are 80 billion in the US.That article noted that insurance was not a complete failsafe against financial disaster for people diagnosed with cancer:From high deductibles to large copayments, cancer patients can end up with a huge stack of bills.In addition, 40% to 85% of all cancer patients have to quit working while undergoing treatment, which creates a financial burden that can last for six months or longer.In the same month, Advisory.com featured a story with a similar headline: “42% of cancer patients their spent entire life savings in 2 years after diagnosis.” The article went on to note that researchers had estimated that patients’ average net worth “fell by 92,098 after two years and by 51,882 after four years.” The claim was also discussed on YCombinator, where one commenter detailed the experiences of a family member:I recently watched a family member go through this. A few things that were sobering to see:– Three weeks in she was buried in paperwork. One chemo treatment would turn into 4-5 invoices from different subcontractors at a single hospital, some covered by her insurance, others not covered. Her insurer denied claims arbitrarily and made her go through a bunch of invasive and unnecessary procedures to prove her illness.– Her insurer started calling her incessantly, insisting that she join some sort of program where they would “help” her make decisions about her care. It undermined the confidence she had in her doctors and the decisions she was trying to make, which is a terrible feeling for anyone to go through when they are sick with cancer and trying to survive.– There were a series of insurance “land mines” on the horizon – forget to renew this thing on this random date 2 months from now? You’ve lost your insurance.The whole healthcare and insurance system is a dark pattern, even for working adults who are fully covered.Many of the articles referenced the same aforementioned study, which was published in the American Journal of Medicine in October 2018. Titled “Death or Debt? National Estimates of Financial Toxicity in Persons with Newly-Diagnosed Cancer,” the research examined the financial effects on Americans undergoing cancer treatment:Across 9.5 million estimated new diagnoses of cancer from 2000–2012, individuals averaged 68.6±9.4 years with slight majorities being married (54.7%), not retired (51.1%), and Medicare beneficiaries (56.6%). At year+2, 42.4% depleted their entire life’s assets, with higher adjusted odds associated with worsening cancer, requirement of continued treatment, demographic and socioeconomic factors (ie, female, Medicaid, uninsured, retired, increasing age, income, and household size), and clinical characteristics (ie, current smoker, worse self-reported health, hypertension, diabetes, lung disease) (P<.05); average losses were 92,098. At year+4, financial insolvency extended to 38.2%, with several consistent socioeconomic, cancer-related, and clinical characteristics remaining significant predictors of complete asset depletion.That study began by referencing Breaking Bad, a popular drama about a mild-mannered teacher diagnosed with cancer who goes on to become a drug kingpin in order to finance his treatment:Breaking Bad is a critically acclaimed American television show about Walter White, who is diagnosed with lung cancer. Even though Walter worked two jobs and had health insurance, he still could not afford his medical care. To pay for his cancer treatment and to protect his family from financial burden, Walter illegally synthesized and sold methamphetamine. Although this is a fictional story, it highlights the reality of the economic burden of cancer in America.Numerous confounding factors are referenced in the study. Among them was the exclusion of cancer patients who do not recover, in which case the costs of end-of-life care are not tallied:Depending on cancer type and stage, costs range between 20-100k during the first year after diagnosis, but the average cost increases to over 60k at the end of life. This evidence suggests that terminally ill patients experience worse financial toxicity. Notably, [study authors] did not assess the financial toxicity experienced during end of life care because they omitted the ~30% of the cancer patients who died during the study. Consequently, the study does not examine the significant financial toxicity associated with fatal cancers.Differences made by the 2010 passage of the Affordable Care Act (also known as the ACA or Obamacare) did not seem to dramatically affect the findings, despite its passage during the years researchers examined in the study. The law is mentioned once, in the course of referencing various disenfranchised groups, although researchers noted that having insurance had a protective effect:Additionally, by relying on the HRS, Gilligan et al. were not able to comment on financial toxicity in disenfranchised groups, such as homeless or undocumented patients. Undocumented immigrants have the lowest rate of health insurance in America, thus increasing their risk of financial toxicity due to cancer. This is because they are not eligible for Affordable Care Act exchanges or Medicaid benefits. Undocumented immigrants can get health coverage through their employers, however most take low paying jobs that do not offer health insurance. Similarly, 60% of the homeless people in the U.S. are uninsured … Multiple reports, including the Gilligan et al. study, show that private insurance is protective against financial toxicity.Insurance also posed different risks to the insured patients whose data appeared in the study:Among patients enrolled in copayment assistance programs, 20% took less medication than prescribed, 19% filled half of their prescriptions, and 24% did not fill prescriptions. Over 7% of the patients in these programs delayed procedures, testing, chemotherapy or clinic visits.Finally, the study found that costs were increasing and that the myriad difficulties cited were likely to worsen:Unfortunately, direct medical costs are expected to increase by 40% for patients by 2020, thus exacerbating the financial burden of medical care for cancer patients in the United States.The key finding upheld Sanders’ tweet:[Researchers] reported that over 42% of patients fully depleted their assets and over 30% incurred debt (consumer, mortgage or home equity) by the second-year of their diagnosis.That 42 percent of patients in the study represented the four in ten cancer patients that Sanders referenced — although technically it might be more accurate to say 4.2 out of ten patients would “deplete their assets” (in other words, “lose their life savings”) to pay for the necessary treatments. Thirty percent of study participants incurred debt, and the study omitted the 30 percent of patients who did not recover and died — presumably patients who incurred end of life costs and who certainly became unable to financially contribute to their households. Sanders’ claim was based on peer-reviewed research published in a medical journal, not polling or broad estimates, a claim which was thus quite well-supported. Claim: Four in ten cancer patients lose their life savings after starting treatment. Output:","output":"The claim that four in ten cancer patients lose their life savings after starting treatment is supported by a study published in the American Journal of Medicine in October 2018. The research, titled “Death or Debt? National Estimates of Financial Toxicity in Persons with Newly-Diagnosed Cancer,” examined the financial effects on Americans undergoing cancer treatment. The study found that 42.4% of cancer patients depleted their entire life's assets, with an average loss of 92,098. The study also found that 30% of participants incurred debt, and it did not account for the 30% of patients who did not recover and died, presumably taking on even more costs during end-of-life care.

Rebecca English. PUBLISHED:. 12:09 EST, 23 January 2013. |. UPDATED:. 13:02 EST, 23 January 2013. You can always rely on children to ask the questions that even Jeremy Paxman would fear to utter. The Duchess of Cornwall's bananaskin yesterday came courtesy of a six year old primary school pupil who asked her innocently: 'Are you going to be Queen?' The textbook answer, as far as Clarence House is concerned, would have been 'No, Princess Consort' - which is what they have always insisted she will be called when Prince Charles accedes to the throne. Camilla is passionate about literature and has long campaigned to get children reading more. Instead Camilla laughed and replied mischievously: 'You never know.' Her response is likely to add to fuel to the fire of constitutional debate over the Duchess's future role. The prince's advisors plumped for the. title on her somewhat controversial marriage to the Prince of Wales in. order to placate public sensibilities. Academics insist, however, that she will legally be Queen whatever Charles chooses to call her. And friends of the prince say he has always been hopeful that the public would indeed accept her as just that. The Duchess was out and about on public duties yesterday to promote her new patronage of national literacy charity, Beanstalk. The organisation recruits and trains. volunteers from every walk of life to work in primary schools with. children who have fallen behind in their reading. Camilla is passionate about literature and has long campaigned to get children reading more. Yesterday she was at St Mary's RC. Primary School in Battersea, south west London, to meet some of the. children Beanstalk has helped. As wife of the future king, the Duchess of Cornwall is undoubtedly an expert on anything royal. And yesterday she declared  seven-year-old Chrisangelo Ayag’s kingly outfit as ‘superbly authentic’. ‘I must say,’ she said, ‘you look pretty cool.’ Of Jack and the Beanstalk, the Duchess said: 'I find that the more gruesome it is, they more they love it' Whether that’s a compliment she. frequently pays her husband, the Prince of Wales, is anyone’s guess –. although he was recently named by GQ magazine as one of the snappiest. dressers in Britain. But Camilla was certainly very taken. with her new young friend, wearing who was wearing a paper crown, cloak. and a drawn-on beard. She appeared entranced as the pupils. treated her to a performance of one of the books they have recently been. reading, an African tale called The Papaya Who Spoke, featuring. Chrisangelo in a starring role. She also met several youngsters. working with their volunteers, including five-year-old Omani Koroma, who. has come on ‘leaps and bounds’ with the help of Isobel Patchett. After listening to him reading aloud,. she said: ‘Omani, that was brilliant. I give you ten out of ten. Keep it. up. Everyone is very proud of you.’ She also treated some of the children. to a rendition of Jack and the Beanstalk. Discussing the story. afterwards,  particularly the child-eating giant, she said: ‘I find with. children that the more gruesome it is, they more they love it.’ The Duchess left the school with three signed copies of the book. Camilla met children who have fallen behind in their reading, but are benefitting from the scheme.

What is the answer for the question: How many nautical miles does the does the coastal nation have sole exploitation rights over natural resources? from the following article ?  \\"Freedom of the seas\\" is a principle in international law dating from the seventeenth century. It stresses freedom to navigate the oceans and disapproves of war fought in international waters. Today, this concept is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the third version of which came into force in 1994. Article 87(1) states: \\"The high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked.\\" Article 87(1) (a) to (f) gives a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of submarine cables, building artificial islands, fishing and scientific research. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.UNCLOS defines various areas of water. \\"Internal waters\\" are on the landward side of a baseline and foreign vessels have no right of passage in these. \\"Territorial waters\\" extend to 12 nautical miles (22 kilometres; 14 miles) from the coastline and in these waters, the coastal state is free to set laws, regulate use and exploit any resource. A \\"contiguous zone\\" extending a further 12 nautical miles allows for hot pursuit of vessels suspected of infringing laws in four specific areas: customs, taxation, immigration and pollution. An \\"exclusive economic zone\\" extends for 200 nautical miles (370 kilometres; 230 miles) from the baseline. Within this area, the coastal nation has sole exploitation rights over all natural resources. The \\"continental shelf\\" is the natural prolongation of the land territory to the continental margin's outer edge, or 200 nautical miles from the coastal state's baseline, whichever is greater. Here the coastal nation has the exclusive right to harvest minerals and also living resources \\"attached\\" to the seabed.

Question: Where was Avestan found? Context: The other directly attested Old Iranian dialects are the two forms of Avestan, which take their name from their use in the Avesta, the liturgical texts of indigenous Iranian religion that now goes by the name of Zoroastrianism but in the Avesta itself is simply known as vohu daena (later: behdin). The language of the Avesta is subdivided into two dialects, conventionally known as \\"Old (or 'Gathic') Avestan\\", and \\"Younger Avestan\\". These terms, which date to the 19th century, are slightly misleading since 'Younger Avestan' is not only much younger than 'Old Avestan', but also from a different geographic region. The Old Avestan dialect is very archaic, and at roughly the same stage of development as Rigvedic Sanskrit. On the other hand, Younger Avestan is at about the same linguistic stage as Old Persian, but by virtue of its use as a sacred language retained its \\"old\\" characteristics long after the Old Iranian languages had yielded to their Middle Iranian stage.

Radley holds out his arms to hug his daughter, but Carla just hands him a plastic bag partially filled with water and holding her goldfish, and she goes to hug the headmaster of the school, Dr. Johnson (Harvey Miller), instead. Dr. Johnson assures her she's ready to return home.As Radley and Carla are flying home to San Francisco, flashbacks show Carla as a little girl, having an outburst during dinner. Radley and his wife, Elizabeth (Diane Keaton), argue in the living room. Elizabeth insists that Carla needs professional help, and they enroll her in Roselake.Carla is welcomed home by her family, and her sister, Caroline (Poppy Montgomery), announces she's engaged to be married to her fiance, Jeff Reed (Joe Flanigan). Carla hands her mother a bunch of necklaces she'd made at the school; one for everyone in the family.After dinner, the family gathers in the living room (it's seen now that the Tate family is wealthy, and lives well). When Jeff mentions the subject of his doctoral dissertation, Elizabeth drops a not-so-subtle criticism of Caroline's job teaching second grade at an elementary school, despite the fact that Caroline enjoys doing it.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday revived the June 12 Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, eight days after canceling it. Trump said he was convinced of Kim’s commitment to denuclearization by the renewed diplomatic talks that included a visit to Washington by Kim Yong Chol, the North’s former intelligence chief, who carried a letter from the North Korean leader. South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been influential in facilitating the U.S.-North Korea summit, in getting Kim to agree to the broad goal of denuclearization, and in urging Trump to stay committed to the diplomatic process to resolve differences with North Korea. President Trump seems to be leaning now towards Moon’s approach versus the more confrontational stance advocated by some of his security team in demanding that North Korea unilaterally and completely disarm before any concessions are granted. Friday Trump downplayed expectations for a major breakthrough at the summit, saying it will be the beginning of a process. He also backed away from his “maximum pressure” approach that stressed tough sanctions and the threat of military force, focusing instead on brokering an agreement to end the North’s nuclear program for economic aid and security guarantees that could include a peace treaty to replace the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953.

I know that the answer to the question \\"What was the downplaying of the syllable?\\" is in \\"In 1968 Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle published The Sound Pattern of English (SPE), the basis for generative phonology. In this view, phonological representations are sequences of segments made up of distinctive features. These features were an expansion of earlier work by Roman Jakobson, Gunnar Fant, and Morris Halle. The features describe aspects of articulation and perception, are from a universally fixed set, and have the binary values + or −. There are at least two levels of representation: underlying representation and surface phonetic representation. Ordered phonological rules govern how underlying representation is transformed into the actual pronunciation (the so-called surface form). An important consequence of the influence SPE had on phonological theory was the downplaying of the syllable and the emphasis on segments. Furthermore, the generativists folded morphophonology into phonology, which both solved and created problems.\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","output":"The downplaying of the syllable that you're referring to is based upon Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle's theory on generative phonology. Essentially, this theory put greater emphasis on phonemic segments rather than the syllable as a whole. Phonemes are the smallest units of sound in a language that can distinguish one word from another. For example, the sounds /p/ and /b/ in English distinguish \\"pat\\" from \\"bat\\". These phonemes are composed of binary features, such as voicing, place of articulation, and manner of articulation. These features are universal and their values are represented by + or -.  In contrast to phonemes, syllables are larger units. A syllable can be composed of one or more phonemes. In the pre-Chomsky and Halle era, the syllable was often treated as the basic unit of phonology. In their 1968 work, The Sound Pattern of English, Chomsky and Halle theorized that phonological representations are sequences of phonemic segments, each composed of distinctive features. They introduced an updated phonological model that included at least two levels of representation: underlying representation, or the underlying phonemic structure of a word, and the surface phonetic representation, or how the word is actually pronounced. The key outcome of this theory was it downplayed the role of the syllable in phonological analysis and emphasized phonemic segments. This shift in focus was significant as it altered the dominant way of analyzing and understanding the sound patterns of English, and also presented a new approach (morphophonology) of studying the interaction between phonological and morphological structure.

Article: For 99% of human history, people took their food from the world around them. They ate all that they could find, and then moved on. Then around 10,000 years ago, about 1% of human history, people learned to farm the land. The kind of food we eat depends on which part of the world we live in, or which part of our country we live in. For example, in the south of China they eat rice, but in the north they eat noodles. In European countries near the sea, people eat a lot of fish. In central Europe, away from the sea, people don't eat so much fish, but they eat more meat. For example, in Germany and Poland, there are hundreds of different kinds of sausages. In North America, Australia, and Europe, people eat with knives and forks. In China, people eat with chopsticks. In parts of India and the Middle East, people use their fingers to pick up food. Nowadays it is possible to transport food easily from one part of the world to another. We can eat whatever we like, at any time of the year. In Britain, bananas come from Africa; rice comes from India or the U.S.A.; strawberries come from Chile or Spain. Food is a very big business.

The other options do not quite fit the context of the situation in the same way. To elaborate, \\"leave work\\" signifies that she can attend to her other responsibilities outside her job, which is an essential part of managing her busy schedule. When she is done with work for the day, she can allocate her time and energy toward her personal errands and ensuring that her children are taken care of properly.  On the other hand, \\"make time for\\" could partially make sense, as she might need to make time for her errands and responsibilities related to her kids, but it does not quite address the specific scenario of what she needs to do within her schedule. It is more of a general concept that could involve rearranging her daily routine to accommodate these tasks rather than addressing the precise action she needs to take. \\"Take money\\" and \\"field\\" don't have any logical connection to the situation at hand. Taking money does not relate to her need to manage her busy schedule nor does it connect closely to her personal responsibilities. Field, as a verb, typically signifies responding to questions or concern – a usage that does not fit with this particular context, as we are discussing her schedule management rather than a response to a particular issue or question. Lastly, \\"go outdoors\\" could refer to her stepping outside in general, but that action alone does not necessarily signify that she is ready to run errands or pick up her children. Unlike \\"leave work,\\" which is clearly linked to closing her workday and transitioning to her personal responsibilities, \\"go outdoors\\" is more ambiguous and could imply a variety of activities that are unrelated to running errands or picking up the kids. In conclusion, \\"leave work\\" is the most appropriate answer since it clearly indicates her moving on from her job responsibilities and addressing the busy schedule she has outside of work. This involves handling personal errands and ensuring her children are picked up and cared for properly, which the other answer choices do not accurately portray or encompass in the same comprehensive way."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It offers more protection than other United States Forest Service lands, surrounds Mono Lake and its two volcanic islands, Black Point, Panum Crater and much of the northern half of the Mono Craters. Litigation and outreach by the Mono Lake Committee, the National Audubon Society and other conservation groups has helped to slow water diversions from tributaries feeding Mono Lake.A series of earthquakes inside Long Valley Caldera, coincidentally starting two weeks after the May 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington, alerted geologists to the possibility of renewed volcanic activity in the region. Four magnitude 6 earthquakes struck the southern margin of Long Valley Caldera in an area that was close to the Mono–Inyo fissure system. The caldera floor had also uplifted by 10 inches (30 cm) in five years. Upward movement of magma under the caldera was thought to be the cause of the earthquakes and uplift.Persistent earthquake swarms in 1982 prompted the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to issue a \\"potential volcanic hazard\\" notice for Long Valley. That same year, permanent monitoring of the area by the Long Valley Observatory started. The hazard notice was lifted in 1984 after USGS scientists concluded that magma had been injected into fissures below Mammoth Mountain but had congealed underground. From 1990 to 1996, 150 acres (60 ha) of trees were killed on Mammoth Mountain by 20% to 95% concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the soil (less than 1% is normal). Chemical analysis of the CO2 indicated it was derived from magma. Answer:","output":"The name of the area that had an upward movement of magma under it is Long Valley Caldera. This caldera is located in Eastern California and experienced a series of earthquakes in 1980, which alerted geologists to the possibility of renewed volcanic activity in the region. The earthquakes and uplift in the caldera floor were thought to be caused by the upward movement of magma under the caldera. The potential volcanic hazard notice was issued in 1982 by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) for Long Valley, and the monitoring by the Long Valley Observatory began the same year. In 1984, the hazard notice was lifted after USGS scientists concluded that magma had been injected into fissures below Mammoth Mountain, but it had congealed underground. From 1990 to 1996, high concentrations of CO₂ in the soil, derived from magma, led to the death of 150 acres of trees on Mammoth Mountain. It is essential to keep monitoring such areas to detect signs of volcanic activity and take necessary precautions to protect the environment, wildlife, and people in the vicinity."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Definition: A ploynomial equation is a sum of terms. Here each term is either a constant number, or consists of the variable x raised to a certain power and multiplied by a number. These numbers are called weights. For example, in the polynomial: 2x^2+3x+4, the weights are: 2,3,4. You can present a polynomial with the list of its weights, for example, equation weights = [6, 4] represent the equation 6x + 4 and equation weights = [1, 3, 4] represent the equation 1x^2 + 3x + 4. In this task, you need to compute the result of a polynomial expression by substituing a given value of x in the given polynomial equation. Equation weights are given as a list.

Through Kathleen, Bob gets entangled in a dangerous network. Will Kathleen be able to win his trust? Review: The dialogue in this movie is very natural and the story unfolds nicely although it stays a bit on the surface and it would have been nice if the character's 'psychology' would have been worked out a little more. Why do these people do the things they do? What motivates their choices? This is what gives a movie depth and something to think about in my view. The story never reaches an emotional climax, even though the characters go through enough to justify that. So you don't get to know the characters on that deeper level. The actors deliver good work and play in a very natural and 'believable' way, but I think it would have suited the movie better if Kathleen had been played by a younger actress, as this character's naiveness doesn't quite work for a grown-up woman.

Paragraph: Early in chapter 5 we introduced, along with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, two other men who became operational coordinators for al Qaeda: Khallad and Nashiri. As we explained, both were involved during 1998 and 1999 in preparing to attack a ship off the coast of Yemen with a boatload of explosives. They had originally targeted a commercial vessel, specifically an oil tanker, but  Bin Laden urged them to look for a U.S.warship instead. In January 2000, their team had attempted to attack a warship in the port of Aden, but the attempt failed when the suicide boat sank. More than nine months later, on October 12,2000, al Qaeda operatives in a small boat laden with explosives attacked a U.S. Navy destroyer, the USS Cole. The blast ripped a hole in the side of the Cole, killing 17 members of the ship's crew and wounding at least 40. The plot, we now know, was a full-fledged al Qaeda operation, supervised directly by  Bin Laden. He chose the target and location of the attack, selected the suicide operatives, and provided the money needed to purchase explosives and equipment. Nashiri was the field commander and managed the operation in Yemen. Khallad helped in Yemen until he was arrested in a case of mistaken identity and freed with  Bin Laden's help, as we also mentioned earlier. Local al Qaeda coordinators included Jamal al Badawi and Fahd al Quso, who was supposed to film the attack from a nearby apartment. The two suicide operatives chosen were Hassan al Khamri and Ibrahim al Thawar, also known as Nibras. Nibras and Quso delivered money to Khallad in Bangkok during Khallad's January 2000 trip to Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok. In September 2000,  Bin Laden reportedly told Nashiri that he wanted to replace Khamri and Nibras.

Q: Set in medieval England, the plot concerns the struggle to restore to the throne the rightful heir, a baby with a distinguishing birthmark, the purple pimpernel on his posterior. Danny Kaye plays Hubert Hawkins, an ex-carnival entertainer who becomes minstrel to the Black Fox, a Robin Hood-type character who leads a band of rebels in the forest in support of the true infant-king.The usurping King Roderick (Cecil Parker) wishes his daughter, Princess Gwendolyn (Angela Lansbury), to marry his neighbour, Sir Griswold of MacElwain (Robert Middleton), and to enlist Griswold's aid against the band of forest rebels. Princess Gwendolyn refuses, since she dreams of a more handsome, gallant lover, and her personal maid Griselda (Mildred Natwick), who is a witch, has predicted that her true love will arrive at the castle to court her. The Griswold marriage plan also displeases Lord Ravenhurst (Basil Rathbone), who fears that Griswold's presence may cost him his privileged position with the king.The Black Fox orders Hawkins to carry the infant-king across the country to safety, accompanied by his captain, the maid Jean. On the journey, a romance blossoms between Hawkins and Jean. They encounter the King's new jester, \\"Giacomo, 'King of Jesters and Jester of Kings'\\" (John Carradine) on his way to the castle. They knock him out and Hawkins impersonates him, hoping to gain entry to the King's castle. He is assigned to steal the key to a secret passage into the castle, through which the Black Fox could then attack. However, Hawkins is unaware that the jester he is impersonating is also a famous assassin whom Lord Ravenhurst plans to employ to murder his rivals at court: Brockhurst, Finsdale, and Pertwee.Upon Hawkins' arrival, Griselda hypnotizes him and changes his personality for that of a gallant, dashing lover, who sneaks into the Princess Gwendolyn's chambers and wins her affections, though he rapidly switches in and out of this personality whenever anyone (including himself) snaps their fingers. Maid Jean is captured on the road by the King's men, who have been sent to round up pretty young girls to decorate the upcoming tournament. The King meets her and takes a fancy to her. She obtains the key to the secret passage by picking his pocket, and passes it along to Hawkins, but in his hypnotized state Hawkins does not remember her or his original mission until he is freed from Griselda's spell, and thus accidentally loses the key back to the king. In order to prevent Princess Gwendolyn from being forced to marry Griswold, Griselda poisons Ravenhurst's competitors Brockhurst, Finsdale and Pertwee, who had supported the proposed match. Ravenhurst mistakenly credits Hawkins for these murders. Later, however, Ravenhurst learns that Hawkins is not in fact the jester/assassin Giacomo, but an imposter, and swiftly suspects him to be the Black Fox himself.During the evening banquet, Sir Griswold arrives to solidify his alliance with the king. However, Gwendolyn openly declares her love for the jester, and the enraged King orders Hawkins' death. Griswold announces that, if \\"Giacomo\\" were a knight rather than a common clown, he would challenge him to mortal combat. With the intent of having the \\"Black Fox\\" get rid of Griswold, Ravenhurst counsels the King that he can get rid of the jester by making him a knight, who would then have to fight Sir Griswold and would surely be killed, thus forcing Gwendoline to marry the victor. A series of comic scenes ensues in which the king's men help Hawkins to rapidly pass through the various trials required to become a knight.Jean uses her confidence with the king to steal back the key and send it to the forest rebels by carrier-pigeon. She also tries to save Hawkins by asking the Black Fox to substitute for him in the joust. But just before the rebels can use the secret passage, it collapses, leaving only a small crawlspace, just large enough for dwarves to pass through. The Black Fox decides to summon Hawkins' friends, a troupe of acrobatic dwarfs from Hawkins' carnival days, and sends them through the passage for a diversionary attack.Meanwhile, in the castle, Hawkins is hastily knighted, and Griswold immediately challenges him to a joust to the death. Griselda tries to save him by poisoning one of the drinks to be used for the toast immediately before the joust, but Griswold also learns of the poison, and after a quarrel between the two combatants over who should drink which drink, the toast is cancelled. Against all odds (mostly due to a lightning bolt which magnetizes his armor), Hawkins wins the joust, but spares Griswold's life.Ravenhurst denounces Hawkins and Maid Jean as imposters. Hawkins's dwarf friends, who have entered the castle through the secret passage, rescue him and capture the castle from the King's soldiers. During this battle, Ravenhurst attacks Hawkins with a sword. Griselda hastily enchants Hawkins again, giving him expert prowess in fencing (again switching between novice and expert at a finger-snap). Hawkins and Ravenhurst fight, and Ravenhurst is finally hurled into the sea by a catapult.Griswold returns to defend the King, but Hawkins reveals the infant king's birthmark to him, as well as to the usurper Roderick and his few surviving soldiers. Overcome with remorse, everyone in the castle pledges allegiance to the true infant-king, and Hawkins leads everyone in one last chorus of \\"Life could not better be\\".

Given the question: Information:  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - Emperor Buretsu (  Buretsu - tenn ) was the 25th emperor of Japan , according to the traditional order of succession . No firm dates can be assigned to this emperor 's life or reign , but he is conventionally considered to have reigned from 498 -- 506 .  - An emperor (through Old French \\"empereor\\" from ) is a monarch, usually the sovereign ruler of an empire or another type of imperial realm. Empress, the female equivalent, may indicate an emperor's wife (\\"empress consort\\"), mother (\\"empress dowager\\"), or a woman who rules in her own right (\\"empress regnant\\"). Emperors are generally recognized to be of a higher honour and rank than kings. In Europe the title of Emperor was, since the Middle Ages, considered equal or almost equal in dignity to that of Pope, due to the latter's position as visible head of the Church and spiritual leader of Western Europe. The Emperor of Japan is the only currently reigning monarch whose title is translated into English as \\"Emperor\\".  - Honour (also honor in American English, see spelling differences) is an abstract concept entailing a perceived quality of worthiness and respectability that affects both the social standing and the self-evaluation of an individual or corporate body such as a family, school, regiment or nation. Accordingly, individuals (or corporate bodies) are assigned worth and stature based on the harmony of their actions with a specific code of honour, and the moral code of the society at large.  - Empress dowager (also dowager empress or empress mother) is the English language translation of the title given to the mother of a Chinese, Japanese, Korean or Vietnamese emperor.  - Old French (', ', \\"\\"; Modern French ) was the Gallo-Romance dialect continuum spoken from the 9th century to the 14th century.  In the 14th century, these dialects came to be collectively known as the \\"langues d'oïl\\", contrasting with the \\"langue d'oc\\" or Occitan language in the south of France. The mid-14th century is taken as the transitional period to Middle French, the language of the French Renaissance, specifically based on the dialect of the Île-de-France region.  - An empire is defined as \\"an aggregate of nations or people ruled over by an emperor or other powerful sovereign or government, usually a territory of greater extent than a kingdom, as the former British Empire, French Empire, Brazilian Empire, Russian Empire, Ottoman Empire, Byzantine Empire or Roman Empire.\\" An empire can be made solely of contiguous territories such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire, or of territories far remote from the homeland, such as a colonial empire.

In the animal car, they knock Wilson (Kenny Baker) out and steal his 10,000 that Wilson plans to pay off various bankers. But they unintentionally leave a cigar as evidence.J. Cheever Loophole (Groucho Marx), a lawyer from New York, arrives to handle the situation over the stolen money. He suspects both Goliath and Professor Atom of being in cahoots with Carter. Loophole then teams up with con artist Antonio 'Tony' Pirelli (Chico Marx) along with carnie Punchy (Harpo Marx) to investigate.Loophole caves in when he sees the menacing Goliath, and gets nowhere with Little Professor Atom. (His attempts to get a cigar from Atom are foiled by the ditzy Tony). In Atom's mini-trailer, Loophole's attempts to ask for a cigar from Atom to compare it with the one at the crime scene are ruined when every time he asks for a cigar, Tony gives him one.

Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: David and I met as interns  on Capital Hill. Our love then grew through a 5-year long-distance relationship. We were able to survive despite our pursuit to become a doctor and a lawyer. He was at the University of Michigan School of Medicine and I was at the University of Maryland School of Law. We encouraged each other. David proposed to me on May 15, 2011 in front of both of our families. It was amazing! I graduated from law school on that day David proposed and we got married the day after he graduated from medical school.    David and I really didn't have much money to have a huge wedding, but we wanted the wedding of our dreams. We decided to plan everything ourselves. For decoration, I tried to create as many ideas as I could. We had a signature drink called \\"The Huxtable\\". We used mostly orchids as our flowers. We made our own seating chart   by downloading a free template and printing it out on a huge foam board. We could not afford a backdrop   to go behind the bridal party, so we made one out of tissue and two enormous peg boards. It was awesome. Many people wanted to buy our backdrop, but I gave it to our linen designer because he gave us crazy discounts.    David designed our guestbook by using the Apple iphone photobook application. It was awesome. He came up with the title \\"Witness to love: David and Susan's Wedding Day\\" for the cover and then on the inside he stated this, in part, \\"Bearing Witness: Thank you for being a witness to our covenant   with God as we commit ourselves to join as one...\\" I was moved deeply by his beautiful words.    We make our ceremony programs. We had a couple of gifts for guests. We gave them a handkerchief with our initials at the church, candy from the self-made candy bar display and stainless steel measuring spoons that said \\"love beyond measure\\".    We had a great wedding and the guests enjoyed themselves. By sharing my wedding story, I just want to tell you that you can have a wedding that you want within budget.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: A strong wind can be a dangerous thing-sometimes it is powerful enough to knock you off your feet.But to plants,the wind is a source of new life,carrying them or their spores thousands of miles. A NASA satellite called QuikSCAT has discovered highways of wind over the Earth's oceans.Scientists believe these invisible roads may explain why many nonflowering plants,such as mosses and lichens ,grow where they do. The satellite is able to send microwaves from space to the surface of the ocean.The pattern of signals that come back shows which way the winds are blowing. Using this  _ , the scientists studied a group of islands in the southern hemisphere ,near Antarctica.Winds tend to blow anticlockwise in this region,but there are lots of local differences. When the researchers compared these local patterns to botanical data,they found that the wind had an important effect on where species of mosses,lichens,and other nonflowering plants grow. For example,Bouvet Island and Heard Island,share 30 percent of their moss species,29 percent of liverworts ,and 32 percent of lichens-even though they are 4,430 kilometers apart.In contrast,Gough Island and Bouvet Island,separated by just 1,860 kilometers of sea,share only 16 percent of mosses and 17 percent of liverworts.They have no lichens in common. Ferns and flowering plants don't travel as well in the wind,so they don't show the same kinds of distribution patterns.

As the destructive power of these storms continued to wreak havoc, communities found themselves faced with difficult and life-threatening challenges. Emergency services and volunteers worked tirelessly to evacuate residents from their homes, rescuing those stranded in the deepening floodwaters. Roads were closed off, and transportation networks were significantly disrupted, with train stations and even airports shutting down for periods during the height of the storms. As the Atlantic storm system continued to pour relentless rain and high-speed winds across Britain, the true scale of the damage was revealed. Ancient buildings, including centuries-old churches and monuments, were destroyed or seriously damaged by the impact of the storms. The severe weather also caused tragic losses, with some individuals being swept out to sea or overtaken by the rapidly rising floodwaters despite rescue attempts. In the face of this unprecedented level of destruction, communities rallied together to provide aid and support wherever needed. Those fortunate enough to have escaped the worst of the flooding opened their homes to displaced families, while aid organizations, such as the Red Cross, provided food, clothing, and emergency relief to those affected. Across the Atlantic, the corresponding storms battered parts of the United States as well, causing further loss of life, widespread destruction, and countless canceled flights. Emergency planning and response were put to the test in both nations, proving that weather patterns have the ability to devastate communities without warning. As the storms began to subside, both the United States and Britain faced a long road to recovery. Governments were pressured to improve flood defenses and emergency response plans, with officials recognizing the need for greater preparation and resilience in facing future extreme weather events. Community members continued to help each other, rebuilding houses, restoring lost possessions, and providing emotional support throughout the recovery process. As they grieved for the lives lost in these natural disasters, the people of both nations came together to find solace and rebuild their homes, neighborhoods, and countries. This story's ending highlights the importance of unity and resilience in facing extreme weather events. These storms also served as a reminder of the growing need for improved preparedness, planning, and adaptation as climate change continues to create more frequent and intense natural disasters across the globe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article with the title: \\"Home Sales Surge, Raising Hope That Housing Sector Is Recovering\\" Article:","output":"Title: Home Sales Surge, Raising Hope That Housing Sector Is Recovering Introduction As the global economy slowly regains its footing after the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, recent trends in home sales have sparked significant optimism in the housing sector. A surge in home sales across major markets has heralded the possibility of a rapid recovery in the real estate market, considered by many to be a key indicator of economic health. In this article, we will delve into the reasons behind this resurgence in home sales, the role of government policies, and the implications of the trend for both buyers and sellers in the housing market. The Surge in Home Sales Recent data from the National Association of Realtors reveals a marked increase in home sales throughout the United States in the past few months. Home sales reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.01 million units in the first quarter of 2021, representing a 16.2% increase from the previous year. Notably, this surge has spanned across both urban and suburban areas, which also witnessed a considerable uptick in first-time buyers entering the market. In addition to the US, other major markets such as the UK and Canada have also reported a similar uptick in home sales. UK's property market posted its strongest quarterly growth in a decade, while Canadian home sales reached a record high in March 2021. Factors Driving the Home Sales Boom Several interrelated factors have contributed to this revival of the housing market in recent months: 1. Record-Low Mortgage Rates: Central banks across the world have responded to the economic crisis by slashing interest rates, making mortgage rates more attractive for potential homebuyers. Lower financing costs have encouraged borrowers to take advantage of these favorable conditions, driving demand for residential real estate. 2. Remote Work and Shift in Housing Preferences: The shift towards remote work in the wake of the pandemic has prompted many urban dwellers to buy homes in suburban or rural areas, where larger homes with more outdoor space can be found. This has resulted in higher demand for single-family homes and properties in suburban neighborhoods. 3. Government Policies: Many governments have enacted stimulus measures and housing-specific incentives to help revive the struggling economy. For instance, the US government has extended the eviction moratorium, while the UK has introduced a temporary Stamp Duty holiday. These initiatives have stimulated the real estate market by making it more attractive for buyers and sellers. 4. Pent-Up Demand: Due to the uncertainty and lockdown measures introduced during the pandemic, potential buyers and sellers had postponed their decision to enter the market. However, as the situation improves and restrictions ease, many of these individuals are now looking to make their move, leading to a surge in sales. Implications for the Housing Sector The current rise in home sales has several implications for various stakeholders in the housing sector: 1. Buyers: First-time buyers may find it more challenging to secure affordable homes, as increasing demand leads to bidding wars and record-high prices for certain properties. However, with mortgage rates remaining low, financing options for buyers remain attractive. 2. Sellers: Current homeowners looking to sell their properties stand to benefit from the surging demand, which has boosted home values and resulted in quicker sales. This allows sellers to capitalize on the strong market and potentially reap significant profits. 3. Housing Affordability: As house prices continue to rise, concerns about housing affordability are growing. Policymakers may need to devise long-term solutions to address this emerging challenge and prevent a widening of the wealth gap. Conclusion The ongoing surge in home sales indeed raises hope for the housing sector's recovery. Supported by low-interest rates, government policies, and changes in housing preferences amidst the pandemic, this upward trajectory has provided a sense of optimism for stakeholders. Nevertheless, addressing housing affordability concerns and ensuring a sustainable expansion in the housing market remains crucial for the long-term economic health of countries worldwide."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On Feb 23, 1836, the Mexican army, under the command of Santa Anna, set siege to what mission?","output":"On February 23, 1836, the Mexican army, under the command of General Antonio López de Santa Anna, set siege to the Alamo Mission, also known as the Mission San Antonio de Padua or simply The Alamo. This historic event took place in present-day San Antonio, Texas, which was then part of the Mexican state, Coahuila y Tejas. The siege marked one of the crucial moments in the Texas Revolution and is now a symbol of heroism and resistance against oppression for Texans and Americans. The Alamo Mission was initially established as a Roman Catholic mission and fort by Spanish missionaries in the early 18th century. Over the years, it served various purposes, from being a religious outpost for spreading Christianity among the local Native American population to functioning as a military garrison. In December 1835, Texian and Tejano volunteer forces successfully overtook the Mexican garrison stationed at the Alamo during the Battle of Bexar. Santa Anna, determined to reclaim the lost territory and quell the increasingly defiant Texian resistance, led a large Mexican army towards San Antonio. The Texians, comprised of a diverse mix of settlers, adventurers, and volunteers, were commanded by Colonel James Bowie and Lieutenant Colonel William B. Travis. Among the ranks of the defenders was the famous frontiersman and former US Congressman, Davy Crockett. On the morning of February 23, 1836, Santa Anna's troops reached San Antonio, and the siege of the Alamo began. The attackers raised a red flag signifying \\"no quarter,\\" indicating that the enemy would not be taken captive but rather executed. The Texian forces defiantly retaliated by firing a cannon, demonstrating their determination not to surrender. Facing a force of around 1,800 to 6,000 Mexican soldiers, the Texian defenders, numbering between 185 and 260, were vastly outnumbered. They held out for 13 days, fending off several assaults with limited supplies and resources. The defenders used the thick walls of the Alamo and firing from elevated positions to repel the attackers. On the early morning of March 6, 1836, Santa Anna ordered a final, all-out assault on the Alamo. The Mexican soldiers scaled the walls and poured into the compound, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat with the exhausted defenders. The battle lasted about 90 minutes, culminating in the complete annihilation of the Alamo garrison. Although the Battle of the Alamo resulted in a Mexican victory, it came at a considerable cost, with hundreds of Mexican soldiers killed or wounded. The heavy casualties weakened Santa Anna's forces, and the determined resistance of the Alamo defenders helped inspire more Texians and settlers to join the revolt against Mexico. Just over a month later, on April 21, 1836, the Texian forces led by General Sam Houston decisively defeated the Mexican army at the Battle of San Jacinto, ensuring the independence of Texas. Today, the Alamo is a revered symbol of courage, patriotism, and the struggle for independence. It serves as a historical site and museum, drawing millions of visitors annually to learn about and remember those who fought and died during the siege."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Although ostensibly retired from racing since 1962, Moss did make a number of one-off appearances in professional motorsport events in the following two decades. He also competed in the 1974 London-Sahara-Munich World Cup Rally in a Mercedes-Benz, but retired from the event in the Algerian Sahara. The Holden Torana he shared with Jack Brabham in the 1976 Bathurst 1000 was hit from behind on the grid and eventually retired with engine failure. Moss, at the wheel of the Torana when the V8 engine let go, was criticised by other drivers for staying on the racing line for over  2/3  of the 6.172 km long circuit while returning to the pits as the car was dropping large amounts of oil onto the road. He also shared a Volkswagen Golf GTI with Denny Hulme in the 1979 Benson & Hedges 500 at Pukekohe Park Raceway in New Zealand.  In 1980 he made a comeback to regular competition, in the British Saloon Car Championship with the works-backed GTi Engineering Audi team. For the 1980 season Moss was the team's number two driver to team co-owner Richard Lloyd. For the 1981 season Moss stayed with Audi, as the team moved to Tom Walkinshaw Racing management, driving alongside Martin Brundle.  Throughout his retirement he raced in events for historic cars, driving on behalf of and at the invitation of others, as well as campaigning his own OSCA FS 372 and other vehicles.

There are confusing legal terms to learn, strict procedures to follow and volumes of case law that often need to be understood to prepare a case. Lake County officials and a private agency that assists indigent litigants in Illinois want to make the practice easier by creating a self-help center for people who choose to represent themselves in legal matters. The center, which will be housed in the law library at the main courthouse in Waukegan, could open later this summer. \\"I think it's going to be extremely helpful,\\" Court Administrator Bob Zastany said. \\"There is a population out there that will take advantage of this resource.\\" The self-help center will be the only one of its kind in the county. Only a few operate nationwide, officials said. The project is the work of Lake County circuit court officials and Prairie State Legal Services, a statewide agency with an office in Waukegan that provides information and legal assistance to poor and elderly Illinois residents. The organization has received a 25,000 grant from the Illinois Equal Justice Foundation, a nonprofit group that funds programs designed to increase access to legal information and assistance, to help pay for the effort. Prairie State will share the money with the county. The county's law library is on the first floor of the governmental center at 18 N. County St. The new self-help center will be designed to help litigants find the information they need to properly represent themselves in court, an undertaking that can be complicated and confusing. \\"Some people can do OK on their own, and some people can do OK with some help,\\" said Linda Rothnagel, the managing attorney for Prairie State Legal Services. \\"But other people can't do it. It's not always easy.\\" Self-representation is a right affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court. The practice is far more common in civil matters than in criminal cases.

His party was the first to reach the Pole overland since Amundsen in 1911 and Scott in 1912, and the first ever to do so using motor vehicles.  In 1960 Hillary organized an expedition to search for the fabled abominable snowman. Hillary was with the expedition for five months, although it lasted for ten. No evidence of Yetis was found, instead footprints and tracks were proven to be from other causes. During the expedition, Hillary travelled to remote temples which contained \\"Yeti scalps\\"; however after bringing back three relics, two were shown to be from bears and one from a goat antelope. Hillary said after the expedition: \\"The yeti is not a strange, superhuman creature as has been imagined. We have found rational explanations for most yeti phenomena\\".  In 1962 he was a guest on the television game show What's My Line?; he stumped the panel, comprising Dorothy Kilgallen, Arlene Francis, Bennett Cerf, and Merv Griffin.

News article: Get more power out of your EcoBoost engine with Ford’s handheld programmer Ford Mustang modified by Mountune (Ford) People have tuned cars for better performance for as long as anyone can remember, but in the age of electronic fuel injection, software upgrades have become as important as camshafts and cylinder heads. Scores of aftermarket companies offer ways to alter a car’s stock programming for more power, but these often void the factory warranty. So what happens when the factory itself gets in on the action? Ford Racing will offer handheld programmers for the turbocharged EcoBoost engines in the Focus ST, Fiesta ST and, eventually, the Mustang. The ProCal handset for the Focus ST’s 2.0-liter four-cylinder and Fiesta ST’s 1.6-liter four-cylinder engines is available at FordRacing.com for 595, and plugs into the diagnostic port in the driver’s side footwell. This allows owners to alter several vehicle parameters, including throttle response, the turbocharger’s wastegate, fuel curves, and spark tuning. Related: Ford Performance confirms Focus RS as part of 12-model blitz That allows for a more aggressive driving experience and, of course, more power. Ford says owners can pull an extra 90 pound-feet of torque from a Focus ST’s motor. The real advantage over aftermarket tuning, though, is that none of this voids the warranty. That makes it less financially risky for owners to start fiddling with a car straight off the dealer lot. Ford also plans to launch a similar device for the 2.3-liter EcoBoost engine in the Mustang. The Blue Oval is trying to cultivate interest in the new downsized power plant from enthusiasts, who tend to gravitate toward the traditional 5.0-liter V8.

Grande dame of cooking still going strong at 90: Julia Child celebrates in San Francisco. How does it feel to turn 90 and have attained the status of an icon, a living legend? \\"It feels just like it felt before,\\" Julia Child says with the throaty laugh familiar to millions who cut their culinary teeth on her \\"French Chef\\" television series. The show, along with her seminal book, \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" (1961), revolutionized the way America cooks and eats. While making light of the difference a day -- or another decade -- makes, Child intends to enjoy her birthday thoroughly. First, there will be all the public observances, including a sold-out dinner Thursday at San Francisco's tony Fifth Floor restaurant, which -- like dinners that night at 19 other venues across the country -- will benefit the scholarship fund of the International Association of Culinary Professionals (which Child co-founded). Friday to Sunday, the action moves to Napa, with both members-only and public events at COPIA: The American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts, of which she is an honorary board member. Aug. 15, her actual birthday, will see her in Maine at an annual gathering of nieces, nephews, their offspring and friends, who for many years have rolled a joined birthday celebration for several members of the group into a jolly reunion. The schedule Child and her assistant of 14 years, former pastry chef Stephanie Hersh, have laid out is not exactly a senior-citizen routine, even though Child has always been candid about her age and realistic in assessing her own capabilities.

Limbani, whose people believe he is already dead, is being held in a remote prison, guarded by ferocious African troops known as the \\"Simbas\\", under General Ndofa.Faulkner provisionally accepts the assignment and sets about recruiting his officers, all of whom have worked with him on previous African operations.

This jaded city has witnessed every variety of killing, from Charles Manson and his helter-skelter spree to the Night Stalker's deadly nocturnal prowling and the random strikes of the Hillside Strangler, the Freeway Killer and the Grim Sleeper.

Police Chief Michel Moore, appointed in 2018, promised reforms and a commitment to transparency, working tirelessly to implement strategies that fostered a sense of unity between officers and citizens.

The city is now gripped by a fear reminiscent of its darker days, with every new detail about the suspect's motivations stirring up old resentments and further straining the delicate relationship between the police and the public. The suspect, identified as a disgruntled former officer, has released a chilling manifesto, detailing his grievances with the department and his alleged mission to \\"cleanse\\" it from corruption. His actions have stunned both the law enforcement community and residents of Los Angeles, who are questioning the ability of the LAPD to protect not only the city but also its own officers.

As the city collectively holds its breath, one thing is clear: This case has exposed old wounds, upended the present state of the LAPD, and shaken the very foundations of trust that the department has worked so hard to rebuild.

The following article contains an answer for the question: Whose husband is a wealthy businessman? , can you please find it?   Down-on-his-luck Los Angeles architect and builder Edward Shaw is approached by Doris Hillman with a business proposal: buying land together, on which he would build houses that she would then sell, using her experience as a former real estate broker. Her husband, Gus Hillman, a wealthy businessman, would be willing to contribute half a million dollars as capital for the venture. Doris quickly seems interested in more than a purely professional relationship. Shaw starts an affair with her and accepts the business offer. However, an accidental discovery leaves him convinced that the Hillmans' interest lies less in the long-term profits of the venture than in the 175,000 key man insurance policy he took on himself as a precondition for the deal, and that an attempt on his life is imminent. Madge, the younger sister of Doris, develops a romantic interest in Shaw as well. Without knowing what Doris has planned, she reveals to Shaw that her sister was married previously to a man who died in Wyoming when his car crashed over a bridge. Shaw ends up drugged by Gus Hillman and barely keeps his car from going off a cliff. The police are skeptical about his story and the insurance company refuses to cancel the policy, Hillman having portrayed Shaw as a man who is trying to steal his wife. Madge teams with Shaw to try to foil her sister's scheme, but Doris lures him to a mountain cabin and shoots him with a gun.

Mike Huckabee resigned Thursday from the Country Music Association Foundation board of directors -- less than one day after his appointment -- after backlash over his anti-gay rights record.      \\"I genuinely regret that some in the industry were so outraged by my appointment that they bullied the CMA and the Foundation with economic threats and vowed to withhold support for the programs for students if I remained,\\" Huckabee wrote in his letter of resignation      Huckabee didn't mention the controversy over his stance on gay rights in his letter. But he wrote, \\"If the industry doesn't want people of faith or who hold conservative and traditional political views to buy tickets and music, they should be forthcoming and say it.\\"      A message left by CNN with the foundation seeking comment Friday morning was not immediately returned.      Huckabee, a two-time Republican presidential candidate, compared legalizing same-sex marriage to incest and polygamy in 2010. He also compared same-sex adoption to experimentation, saying that \\"children are not puppies.\\"      Read More ||||| CLOSE Mike Huckabee and TBN president Matthew Crouch talk about the new show in Nashville      Mike Huckabee is photographed at the TBN campus in Hendersonville on Oct. 2, 2017. (Photo: Alan Poizner / For The Tennessean)      NASHVILLE — Less than one day after his appointment was announced, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee has resigned from the CMA Foundation board of directors, following criticism from multiple members of the country music industry.      \\"The CMA Foundation has accepted former Gov. Mike Huckabee’s resignation from its board of directors, effective immediately,\\" said Amber Williams, CMA vice president of communications and talent relations.      The announcement follows criticism from members of the country music industry, as well as country music fans.      Jason Owen, co-president of Monument Records and owner at Sandbox Entertainment, called the appointment a \\"grossly offensive decision\\" in an email to the association's CEO Sarah Trahern and CMA Foundation executive Tiffany Kerns.      Owen wrote that due to Huckabee’s election to the CMA Foundation’s board, neither his companies, nor anyone they represent would continue to support the foundation.      Owen and his husband Sam are fathers to a young son and are expecting twins. Owen said that Huckabee’s stance on the LGBTQ community “made it clear my family is not welcome in his America.”      “The CMA has opened their arms to him, making him feel welcome and relevant,” Owen wrote. “Huckabee speaks of the sort of things that would suggest my family is morally beneath his and uses language that has a profoundly negative impact upon young people all across this country. Not to mention how harmful and damaging his deep involvement with the NRA is. What a shameful choice.”      The CMA Foundation is the charitable arm of the Country Music Association, devoted to growing and supporting music education programs across the country. Its board consists of 12 members.      Sugarland’s Kristian Bush visited Dodson Elementary School in Hermitage last week with the CMA Foundation. His manager Whitney Pastorek, who is a CMA member, penned an email to CMA executives questioning how many children in the school’s diverse population Huckabee would choose to welcome.      “What a terrible disappointment to see (the CMA Foundation’s) mission clouded by the decision to align with someone who so frequently engages in the language of racism, sexism, and bigotry,” Pastorek wrote. “While Gov. Huckabee's tenure in Arkansas may have resulted in valuable education reform over a decade ago, I find his choice to spend the past ten years profiting off messages of exclusion and hatred (not to mention the gun lobby) to be disqualifying.”      Huckabee’s inclusion on the board has sparked hundreds of comments from outraged fans on social media, many of which are threatening to boycott the CMA, CMA Music Festival and in some cases country music as a whole.      Longtime country music executive and CMA board member Joe Galante explained in a statement that Huckabee was elected to the position because the CMA Foundation could benefit from the knowledge gained during Huckabee’s extensive political career.      “Gov. Huckabee led an impressive administration while serving the state of Arkansas and his policy experience with education reform is something we are fortunate to be able to learn from,” Galante said.      Huckabee raised his profile in the Nashville area in recent months. He tapes his talk show \\"Huckabee\\" just outside of town. \\"Huckabee\\" airs on TBN and includes news commentary along with religious, political and musical guests.      The two-time Republican presidential candidate has held strong, polarizing views on education, including publicly calling for the end of the Department of Education as well as Common Core.      \\"Education is a family function, not a federal one,\\" he tweeted in 2015.      To date, the CMA Foundation, a nonprofit, has invested over 20 million in 84 programs across the national public school system, after-school programs, summer camps and through community outreach organizations.      The news comes four months after the association came under fire for its media guidelines at the annual CMA Awards. The CMA had previously asked media outlets to avoid questions about the recent mass shooting in Las Vegas, gun rights or political affiliations at the awards show, or risk losing their credentials and being escorted by security off the premises.      After a backlash that included criticism from awards show co-host Brad Paisley, the CMA issued an apology and removed the restrictions ahead of the show.

The new Governor, Sir Richard (Cecil Parker), arrives with his charming and cheery but indolent nephew, the Honorable Charles Adare (Michael Wilding). Charles, who is hoping to make his fortune, is befriended by gruff Samson Flusky (Joseph Cotten), a prosperous businessman who was previously a transported convict, apparently a murderer. Sam says that because he has bought the legal limit of land, he wants Charles to buy land and then sell it to him for a profit so that Sam can accumulate more frontier territory. Though the Governor orders him not to go, Charles is invited to dinner at Sam's house. Charles discovers that he already knows Sam's wife, Lady Henrietta (Ingrid Bergman), an aristocrat who was a good friend of Charles' sister when they were all children in Ireland. Lady Henrietta is now a alcoholic who is socially shunned. Sam invites Charles to stay at his house, hoping it will cheer up his wife, who is on the verge of madness. The housekeeper, Milly (Margaret Leighton), has completely taken over the running the household, and is the one who secretly feeds Lady Henrietta alcohol, hoping to destroy her and win Sam's affections. Gradually, Charles restores Henrietta's self-confidence. They become closer and closer, and eventually they share a passionate kiss. But Henrietta explains that she and Sam are bound together most profoundly: when she was young, Sam was the handsome stable boy. Overcome with desire, they ran away and married at Gretna Green. Henrietta's brother, furious that aristocratic Henrietta had paired up with a lowly servant, confronted them. Her brother shot at them and missed; she then shot her brother fatally. Sam made a false confession to save her, and was sent to the penal colony in Australia. She followed him and waited seven years in abject poverty for his release.

What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that is very critical of modern mainstream pop punk bands? from the following article ?  With their love of the Beach Boys and late 1960s bubblegum pop, the Ramones paved the way to what became known as pop punk. In the late 1970s, UK bands such as Buzzcocks and the Undertones combined pop-style tunes and lyrical themes with punk's speed and chaotic edge. In the early 1980s, some of the leading bands in Southern California's hardcore punk rock scene emphasized a more melodic approach than was typical of their peers. According to music journalist Ben Myers, Bad Religion \\"layered their pissed off, politicized sound with the smoothest of harmonies\\"; Descendents \\"wrote almost surfy, Beach Boys-inspired songs about girls and food and being young(ish)\\". Epitaph Records, founded by Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion, was the base for many future pop punk bands. Bands that fused punk with light-hearted pop melodies, such as the Queers and Screeching Weasel, began appearing around the country, in turn influencing bands like Green Day and the Offspring, who brought pop punk wide popularity and major record sales. Bands such as the Vandals and Guttermouth developed a style blending pop melodies with humorous and offensive lyrics. Eventually, the geographically large Midwest U.S. punk scene, anchored largely in places like Chicago and Minneapolis, would spawn bands like Dillinger Four who would take a catchy, hooky pop-punk approach and reinfuse it with some of punk's earlier grit and fury, creating a distinctive punk rock sound with a regional tag. This particular substrate still maintains an identity today. The mainstream pop punk of latter-day bands such as Blink-182 is criticized by many punk rock devotees; in critic Christine Di Bella's words, \\"It's punk taken to its most accessible point, a point where it barely reflects its lineage at all, except in the three-chord song structures.\\"","output":"To complete the task, I will thoroughly read the entire article, and then extract the name of the person who has been critical of modern mainstream pop punk bands.

Paris: Parisian examples of European architecture date back more than a millennium; including the Romanesque church of the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés (1014-1163); the early Gothic Architecture of the Basilica of Saint-Denis (1144), the Notre Dame Cathedral (1163-1345), the Flamboyant Gothic of Saint Chapelle (1239-1248), the Baroque churches of Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis (1627-1641) and Les Invalides (1670-1708). The 19th century produced the neoclassical church of La Madeleine (1808-1842); the Palais Garnier Opera House (1875); the neo-Byzantine Basilica of Sacré-Cœur (1875-1919), and the exuberant Belle Époque modernism of the Eiffel Tower (1889). Striking examples of 20th century architecture include the Centre Georges Pompidou by Richard Rogers and Renzo Piano (1977), and the Louvre Pyramid by I.M. Pei (1989).

Associated Press      NBA referees have been scrutinized over the years for every imaginable bias. Now, though, new research has whistled another trait that may shape how refs call games: their height.      As it turns out, the league’s shorter referee crews call more fouls than its taller officiating teams, according to a Journal of Sports Economics study by Paul Gift and Ryan Rodenberg that examined more than 4,000 regular-season games over four recent NBA seasons.      The study builds on a body of studies that has emerged since the 2007 Tim Donaghy officiating scandal. Before the researchers could do anything, though, they had to calculate each referee’s height. This was trickier than it sounds. The heights of players are meticulously recorded, of course, but referee height isn’t public information.      ENLARGE      To gather their data, the authors interviewed a former NBA referee for his recollections, reviewed clips of game film and examined photographs to measure officials when they were standing next to players with known heights.      Then they split NBA crews into three tiers: 6 feet and under, 6 feet to 6 feet 3 and 6 feet 3 and taller. What they found was that each additional inch per crew resulted in .017 fewer personal fouls per 48 minutes. That means the shortest crew, at 8 2/3 inches shorter than the tallest crew, calls .147 fouls more per game, or a 3.6% increase from the league average.      A spokesman for the NBA said the league was aware of the study months ago and reviews outside research “to see if there is anything we can learn about our staff and target areas of improvement.” But the league dismissed this paper, he said, since its findings “are based on limited information about the average heights of individuals in crews, seemingly arbitrary height groups and no information about the actual caller.”      So what could possibly explain this discrepancy? The authors have two theories. The first is that referee vantage points differ by their heights. It’s possible that shorter referee crews are actually calling better games than their taller peers.      The other theory is more speculative—and more exciting to think about. They hypothesize it could have something to do with a so-called Napoleon complex in professional referees. That, they say, is grounds for future research with a different focus: technical fouls. “One’s height vantage point should play no role in technical foul calls,” they write. “But aggressive, controlling behavior via the Napoleon complex may.” ||||| A new study in the Journal of Sports Economics finds that shorter NBA refs may call more fouls, in an excellent manifestation of the Napoleon Complex. Paul Gift and Ryan Rodenberg looked at 4,463 regular season games from 2008 to 2012, and—controlling for variables like race and experience*—found a relationship between the average heights of three-man refereeing crew and the foul rate (per 48 minutes) of the players they officiated.      Splitting the officiating crews into three height groups, Gift and Rodenberg posted these results:            6' 0'' and under 6' 0'' to 6' 3'' 6'3'' and over p-value Personal fouls/48 4.13 4.09 4.03 0.03 FT attempted/48 4.86 4.79 4.68 0.01 FT made/48 3.71 3.65 3.56 0.00      This isn't a large effect—an average player would have around one more foul every 480 minutes if the crew's average height was under 6 feet instead of over 6-foot-3—but it's statistically valid . The researchers' ANOVA analysis also looked at other stats like rebounds, field goals, and blocks, but nothing else had a significant link (p < 0.05) to the height of the ref crew.      Advertisement      The researchers had to reconstruct the refs' heights themselves and did not list them individually. Joey Crawford is definitely shorter than 6 feet, though.      *All of the controlled variables: Player height, age, position, starting status, and whether they're home or away; ref age, officiating experience, basketball experience, level of education, race, and \\"quality,\\" as judged by an independent ranking system similar to the NBA's own internal tracking.

Step 3: Gather necessary materials Before I start, I would gather a new light bulb, making sure it's the correct type and wattage for the lamp. Depending on the lamp, some may require different light bulb bases such as screw or bayonet. Step 4: Allow the light bulb to cool down If the lamp was turned on recently, I would wait for a few minutes for the burnt-out bulb to cool down before attempting to remove it. Step 5: Removing the old light bulb Depending on the lampshade and its fitting, I would either remove or lift the lampshade to access the lightbulb easily. Then, I would gently grip the burnt-out bulb and twist it counterclockwise (for a screw base) or push and twist counterclockwise (for a bayonet base) until it's released from the socket. Step 6: Installing the new light bulb I would carefully take the new light bulb and insert it into the socket, making sure not to touch the glass part as the oils from the skin can weaken the bulb and decrease its lifespan. I would twist it clockwise (for a screw base) or aligning the base's pins with the slots and twisting it clockwise (for a bayonet base) until it's firmly in place. Step 7: Re-assemble the lampshade Once the new light bulb is installed, I would re-assemble the lampshade back to its original position. Step 8: Test the new light bulb I would plug the lamp back into the electrical outlet and turn it on to ensure that the new light bulb is functioning correctly.

Write a title for this article: RICHMOND – With a full offseason program and nearly two weeks of training camp in the books, Redskins General Manager Bruce Allen sees his players buying into new Coach Jay Gruden’s way of doing things and expressed encouragement over the direction they are headed. GM Bruce Allen, right, and owner Daniel Snyder have seen plenty they like so far in Richmond. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post) “This is his program,” Allen said following Saturday’s practice. “The players have really accepted his philosophy to practice, and I think that’s why we’ve gotten so much good work in so far.” Saturday marked the 10th day of camp, and the ninth practice session since the team reported for duty on July 23. Washington has three days of practice coming up, and then will play its first preseason game Thursday at home against New England. Giving his assessment of how camp has gone so far, Allen said, “Very smooth. But a couple of injuries. Keeping the guys healthy is priority No. 1, and learning, too. So we’re doing well on the learning. We’ve lost a couple guys already.” Players have noted a more spirited and competitive tone to the practices under Gruden, who replaced Mike Shanahan as coach in January. As he tries to rebuild a franchise that went 3-13 last season, Gruden during camp has emphasized strong fundamentals, discipline and high intensity. Players have embraced Gruden’s philosophies and the new energy he brings. “It’s just a different style,” Allen said. “Each coach and each team takes on the personality of its coach, and Jay has been very involved with the guys and his evening meetings really set the tone for the next day’s work.” Asked to describe the tone of those evening meetings, Allen said, “Enthusiastic.” One of Gruden’s chief tasks involves helping quarterback Robert Griffin III rebound from a trying 2013 campaign and also developing him into a more well-rounded quarterback. Allen declined to list what areas of growth he has seen in Griffin since he started working with Allen, but he does see improvements in the quarterback, and the team as a whole. “I think it’s early,” he said. “[Griffin] is learning a new offense and that will take some time, but he’s working hard, and we’re getting better.” Have a Redskins question?

This is called the adolescent growth spurt. In boys, it is controlled by testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty.

Lovecraft, with notable direct references to The Shadow Over Innsmouth and to Cthulhu himself, who is the subject matter of the song's chorus.  It is considered the heaviest track on the album, with the main riff emulating a beast dragging itself into the sea. The Black Sabbath-influenced guitars are downtuned, creating slow and moody ambiance. \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\" was based on Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and conveys the thoughts of a patient unjustly caged in a mental institution. The song opens with a section of clean single strings and harmonics. The clean, arpeggiated main riff is played in alternating 44 and 64 time signatures. The song is structured with alternating somber clean guitars in the verses, and distorted heavy riffing in the choruses, unfolding into an aggressive finale. This structure follows a pattern of power ballads Metallica set with \\"Fade to Black\\" on Ride the Lightning and would revisit with \\"One\\" on ...And Justice for All.\\"Disposable Heroes\\" is an anti-war song about a young soldier whose fate is controlled by his superiors. With sections performed at 220 beats per minute, it is one of the most intense tracks on the record.

The syncopated riffing of \\"Leper Messiah\\" challenges the hypocrisy of the televangelism that emerged in the 1980s. The song describes how people are willingly turned into blind religious followers who mindlessly do whatever they are told. The 136 beats per minute mid-tempo riffing of the verses culminates in a descending chromatic riff in the chorus; it increases to a galloping 184 beats per minute for the middle section that climaxes in a distorted scream of \\"Lie!\\".

The Ottomans were amassing an army at Thebes, and their 2,000-strong cavalry effectively controlled Attica, limiting the Venetians to the environs of Athens, so that the Venetians had to establish forts to secure the road linking Athens to Piraeus. On 26 December, the 1,400-strong remnant of the Hannoverian contingent departed, and a new outbreak of the plague during the winter further weakened the Venetian forces. The Venetians managed to recruit 500 Arvanites from the rural population of Attica as soldiers, but no Greeks were willing to join the Venetian army. In a council on 31 December, it was decided to abandon Athens and focus on other projects, such as the conquest of Negroponte. A camp was fortified at the Munychia to cover the evacuation, and it was suggested, but not agreed on, that the walls of the Acropolis should be razed. As the Venetian preparations to leave became evident, many Athenians chose to leave, fearing Ottoman reprisals: 622 families, some 4,000-5,000 people, were evacuated by Venetian ships and settled as colonists in Argolis, Corinthia, Patras, and Aegean islands. Morosini decided to at least take back a few ancient monuments as spoils, but on 19 March the statues of Poseidon and the chariot of Nike fell down and smashed into pieces as they were being removed from the western pediment of the Parthenon. The Venetians abandoned the attempt to remove further sculptures from the temple, and instead took a few marble lions, including the famous Piraeus Lion, which had given the harbour its medieval name \\"Porto Leone\\", and which today stands at the entrance of the Venetian Arsenal. On 10 April, the Venetians evacuated Attica for the Peloponnese.","output":"Considering the various factors that led to the weakening of Morosini's position in Athens, as well as the ultimate decision to abandon the city, how did the Venetian forces' recruitment challenges, particularly among the Greek population, impact their overall campaign strategy and contribute to their focus on preserving cultural monuments rather than attaining military strength during their occupation of Athens?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: The French side led on two minutes when City's Carli Lloyd handled in the box and Saki Kumagai converted the penalty. Kosovare Asllani quickly slotted in the hosts' equaliser but Dzsenifer Marozsan soon put Lyon deservedly back in front. France striker Eugenie Le Sommer added a third after the break to put Lyon in command for the second leg on 29 April. Champions League debutants City, bidding to be the first English women's team to reach a European final since 2007, almost pulled one back late on but Abbie McManus' effort was palmed onto the woodwork. The French league champions, who have featured in five of the past seven Champions League finals - winning three - could have won in Manchester by a bigger margin. Both sides went into the game having kept 13 clean sheets in their past 16 games, yet the match started at a frantic pace, with three goals in the opening 16 minutes. Lyon had an effort from France captain Wendie Renard cleared off the line even before Japan's Kumagai calmly tucked in from the spot after World Player of the Year Lloyd's handball. Toni Duggan's fine through ball allowed Sweden's Asllani to level but the visitors were a constant threat and Marozsan quickly drilled in for 2-1 and substitute Le Sommer added further damage from a tight angle in the second half. Women's FA Cup finalists City - Britain's first Women's Champions League semi-finalists since Birmingham City in 2013-14 - won the English title and League Cup in 2016 and could still theoretically win five trophies in the space of nine months. But Lyon will now reach 1 June's final in Cardiff if they avoid conceding three goals or more in the return leg in France next Saturday.

This individual clearly displayed a penchant for dominating the conversation and basking in the attention that his self-proclaimed depravity granted him. This conversational imbalance may have left you feeling unheard and irritated by his self-absorption, thus causing your annoyance with him.  It is not uncommon for people to feel irked when they are in the company of someone who is more interested in expressing their opinions than genuinely engaging in a balanced, reciprocal conversation. A healthy interaction typically involves both parties listening and learning from each other, creating a feeling of connection and understanding. When one person seeks to monopolize the conversation and turns it into a monologue, it can breed frustration and alienation for the other individual involved.  Moreover, his constant attempts to prove his depravity might have been off-putting and given you the impression that he was seeking validation or attention rather than having a genuine exchange of ideas. This kind of behavior can be tiresome, especially if it persists throughout the conversation without any semblance of authenticity or vulnerability. In conclusion, the most plausible reason for your annoyance with this person is that he liked hearing himself talk, leaving little room for a genuine conversation and connection between the two of you.

First question: An introvert is like someone who gets tired when they're around a lot of people and needs a little time to recharge, while an extrovert is like someone who gets energy from being around people.

It's not possible to be both at the exact same time, but some people can have parts of both. That's called being an ambivert, like a mix of the two toys.  Second question: This question is actually asking the same thing as the first question. 'Extravert' is just another way to spell 'extrovert'. Both words mean the same thing, like when two friends have different nicknames but are the same person.

Q:It was a made-for-TV moment that all presidents would relish, but it seemed especially significant for the man who turned a reality TV career into a successful bid for the presidency. Donald Trump triumphantly greeted the three Americans released by North Korea in the early morning darkness at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington early Thursday, an image one can expect to see over and over again come the 2020 U.S. presidential election campaign. “It was a very important thing to all of us to be able to get these three great people out,” Trump told reporters on the tarmac. He then went on to speculate that live television coverage of the arrival “probably broke the all-time in history television rating for 3 o’clock in the morning.” It was a moment the president gladly seized given that his White House has been buffeted by a chaotic mix of policy and personal drama in recent days. The prospect of a potentially historic breakthrough on North Korea could move a number of other unwelcome distractions to the side, including the ongoing Russia investigation, the growing legal difficulties for Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and the soap opera that the Stormy Daniels story has become. Daniels is the adult film actress who claims she once had an affair with Trump. He denies the claim. Trump also announced Thursday on Twitter that he will meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on June 12 in Singapore. A new CNN poll found that 77 percent of those surveyed support Trump meeting the North Korean leader, and 53 percent approve of his handling of the North Korea issue generally. Those numbers are in keeping with a general trend of late that has seen the president’s poll ratings improving, perhaps in part because of the strong economy. What does Donald Trump feel regarding the Stormy Daniels drama?  A. not enough information  B. Excitement  C. Happiness  D. Frustration A:","output":"Donald Trump likely feels frustration regarding the Stormy Daniels drama. This situation serves as an unwelcome distraction from his administration's policy initiatives and achievements. The Stormy Daniels story involves personal allegations against Trump, which might damage his reputation and support, despite his denial of the claims. Furthermore, it diverts attention from matters such as the potential historic breakthrough with North Korea and the strong economy, which could otherwise contribute to improving his poll ratings. As a result, it is reasonable to assume that Trump experiences frustration in relation to the ongoing Stormy Daniels drama."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the question: What is the final step of the following process: -  A stream or river must occur - Through erosion, the stream cuts into the soil and bedrock - Through continuous erosion, a deep gash is cut through - After many years the river may dry up The answer is:","output":"The final step of the given process, which describes the formation of a landscape feature through the action of a stream or river and subsequent erosion, can be summarized as follows: - The formation of a canyon, gorge, or valley as the lasting geological impact of the stream or river. To provide a more detailed explanation, let's first recap the process described in the given question: 1. A stream or river occurs, typically as a result of precipitation, snowmelt, or groundwater seeping to the surface. This formation of waterways is typically influenced by factors such as topography, geology, climate, and the presence of vegetation. 2. Through the process of erosion, the stream or river cuts into the soil and bedrock. Erosion is the gradual wearing away of rock, soil, and other materials by various agents, such as water, wind, or ice. In this case, the moving water in the stream or river erodes the surrounding material over time. 3. With the continuous action of erosion, a deep gash is cut through the landscape. This process often progresses faster in areas where the bedrock is relatively soft or has natural fractures, making it more susceptible to erosion. 4. After many years, it is possible that the river may dry up due to various factors, such as a change in local climate, reduced precipitation, or human intervention (e.g., damming, water diversion). However, even after the river ceases to flow, the landscape feature remains. The final step of the process, therefore, is the formation of a canyon, gorge, or valley as the lasting geological impact of the stream or river. These formations are characterized by steep-sided slopes, with varying depths and widths, and can be found on every continent. These landscape features can continue to evolve long after the stream or river has dried up, with factors such as weathering and slope failures contributing to their ongoing development. Additionally, the canyons, gorges, and valleys that form as a result of these processes can have a significant impact on local ecosystems, providing unique habitats for plant and animal life, as well as acting as natural barriers between different regions. In conclusion, the final step in the process described by the given question is the formation of a canyon, gorge, or valley as the lasting geological impact of the stream or river. These landscape features arise through the continuous action of erosion and remain as striking examples of the power of water in shaping the Earth's surface, even after the river or stream has dried up."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

According to The Star, it already reduced international travelers' wait times by four minutes at the Mineta San Jose International Airport.      Dulles first tested the use of facial recognition as a security measure back in 2015, but it has only just implemented the fledgling technology on August 20th. It's one of the first 14 airports to launch biometric entry and exit using facial comparison, and the data it collects will help CBP determine how to use the technology. The agency is hoping to be able to completely replace boarding passes and IDs with a new security process that only uses facial recognition in the future.      Casey Durst, CBP's director, said in a statement: ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.      / Updated By Tom Costello and Ethan Sacks      WASHINGTON — Facial recognition technology caught an impostor trying to enter the U.S. on a fake passport that may have passed at face value with humans, federal officials said Thursday.      And the groundbreaking arrest came on just the third day the biometric technology has been used at Washington Dulles International Airport.      The 26-year-old man arrived Wednesday on a flight from Sao Paulo, Brazil, and presented a French passport to the customs officer, according to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Using the new facial comparison biometric system, the officer determined the unidentified traveler did not match the passport he presented.      After being sent for a secondary examination, an identification card from the Republic of Congo was found hidden at the bottom of the man's shoe, officials said.      \\"So he was trying to enter the country illegally, we apprehended him, processed him and returned him back to Brazil,\\" CBP Area Port Director Daniel Mattina told NBC News at the airport.      A search revealed the man's Republic of Congo identification card concealed in his shoe. The photo on the card has been altered to conceal the man's identity by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. U.S. Customs and Border Protection      Wednesday's arrest was the first identity scammer detected using the new technology, U.S. officials said. The fledgling technology is already being tested at 14 airports, including Dulles starting on Monday.      \\"You can much more accurately identify who an individual is. You can much more rapidly speed them through processes,\\" David Heyman, a former assistant secretary with the Department of Homeland Security during the Obama administration, told NBC News. \\"And be much more likely be able to target the individuals who are unlawfully present in the United States.\\"      Facial recognition uses algorithms to match physical characteristics against photos and videos of people's faces that are on file from visas, passports and other sources. Customs officials say the cameras have a 99 percent accuracy rate. But critics worry about the implications for invasions of privacy that come with widespread use of the technology and the potential for mistaken matches.      Proponents of facial recognition in airports believe the biometric technology could be used as both a security enhancement and to speed up end-to-end processing starting at check-in. The Transportation Security Administration has said it may eventually replace boarding passes, and the agency is testing the technology at a checkpoint at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport.      Tom Costello reported from Washington, D.C., and Ethan Sacks from New York City. ||||| Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents used new facial recognition technology to arrest a man trying to enter the U.S. illegally, the agency said Thursday.

He was taken in for questioning, and during a search, officials say they found the man's actual ID from the Republic of Congo hidden in his shoe.      The agency said it was the first time a passenger with fake travel documents was discovered using the technology. CBP did not reveal the man's name, citing a pending investigation. He faces possible criminal prosecution.      \\"Facial recognition technology is an important step forward for CBP in protecting the United States from all types of threats,\\" said Casey Durst, director of the CBP's Baltimore Field Office. \\"Terrorists and criminals continually look for creative methods to enter the U.S. including using stolen genuine documents. The new facial recognition technology virtually eliminates the ability for someone to use a genuine document that was issued to someone else.\\"      CBP said it's assessing the use of the technology as part of a future process in which travelers use biometrics instead of their boarding pass or physical ID to pass through security screening.      In 2015, CBS News was given access to a demonstration of the facial recognition technology at Dulles during a pilot program. It officially started at Dulles on Monday. In June, Orlando International Airport became the first in the country to implement the program. According to CBP, there are now 14 airports using it.

The infiltration of a Middle Eastern terror network by a mole who helped foil a plot to blow up a U.S.-bound plane was a \\"phenomenal,\\" \\"brilliant\\" and \\"powerful\\" success, experts said Wednesday. It's unclear how much of the credit should go to the United States or to Saudi Arabia, for whom sources say the mole was working, but both countries have delivered a practical and psychological setback to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, analysts on the region said. Western officials describe that affiliate as al Qaeda's most dangerous. \\"It's a devastating blow to al Qaeda, though not a fatal one,\\" said Juan Zarate, who was deputy national security adviser for combating terrorism under President George W. Bush. \\"What this demonstrates is that we have the ability to get on the inside.\\" And the plot, by the same group that launched a failed attempt to bomb a U.S.-bound airliner on Christmas 2009, demonstrates the continued \\"rise of the affiliates,\\" he said. \\"We have a decimated al Qaeda core -- the al Qaeda of 2001 that we have battled and really dismantled in many ways has metastasized and is now presenting itself in this regional form.\\" This latest intelligence success marks the deepest known penetration into al Qaeda, said Ali Soufan, a former FBI official who oversaw highly sensitive international terrorism cases. But he noted many intelligence efforts remain secret. \\"It's a major success for the CIA and for the intelligence community,\\" he said. And, he noted, as in this case with Saudi Arabia, \\"overseas most of our work is done in cooperation with friendly services.\\" Of the al Qaeda affiliate groups trying to carry out terrorist operations today, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is the closest version to the network Osama bin Laden led, Soufan said. Bruce Riedel, who spent 30 years in the CIA and was a senior adviser on the Middle East to four presidents, said thwarting the bomb plot is \\"primarily a Saudi success story\\" -- and not their first. \\"They foiled the AQAP plot in October 2010 to send bombs to the U.S. on FedEx and UPS planes,\\" he noted. That plot was foiled by an informant. Some details remain unknown. This time, Riedel said, Saudi intelligence managed to \\"get access to AQAP's plot and actually get the bomb.\\" Still, thwarting this attack doesn't damage the organization substantially in the big picture, analysts said. \\"While this is a good technical success, the harsh reality is that in Yemen, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is growing, getting more powerful, recruiting more assets and taking advantage of the fact that Yemen is essentially the Humpty Dumpty of the Arabian Peninsula -- it's falling apart, broken,\\" said Riedel, now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank added that while it is a \\"big intelligence success\\" for the United States and Saudi Arabia, \\"there's a limit to their success as well.\\" The operation did not lead intelligence services to Ibrahim al-Asiri, the chief bomb maker for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or to the location where he makes the bombs. \\"They were able to take out Fahd al-Quso, who's a senior operational planner in the group, but they were not able to take out this very dangerous bomb maker who's ingenious at making bombs,\\" Cruickshank noted. Information from the mole led to a CIA drone strike Sunday in Yemen that killed al-Quso, 37, a senior operative of the al Qaeda affiliate. He was a suspect in the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen. He was convicted in a Yemeni court but escaped from jail. All the analysts who spoke to CNN expressed concern that a mole's involvement was leaked to the media. \\"I think authorities, particularly the CIA, would rather not talk about this right now,\\" said Zarate, now a senior adviser on counterterrorism for the Center for Strategic and International Studies. These kinds of sources \\"can lead to additional counterterrorism successes or insights,\\" he said. \\"So the fact that this is now front page news certainly doesn't help.\\" Soufan, who runs a consultancy group on security issues, said, \\"When you're doing operations like this, you have to do whatever you can do to protect sources and methods -- not only of the CIA but also of the other intelligence services that were involved in this. Because down the road they will be hesitant to cooperate with us.\\" However, Zarate said, there may be a bit of a silver lining in the leak. \\"I think what this will do is it will increase the amount of vigilance and mistrust within al Qaeda circles to outsiders. They need outsiders to supplement their ranks and allow them to plot against the West. ... It will create layers of distrust and will create inefficiencies,\\" Zarate said.

Answer the following question: Given the background: Raising the temperature of a chemical reaction usually results in a higher rate of reaction. When the reactant particles are heated, they move faster and faster. This results in a greater frequency of collisions. A more important effect of the temperature increase is that the collisions occur with a greater force and are thus more likely to surmount the activation energy barrier and go on to form products. Increasing the temperature of a reaction increases the number of effective collisions between reacting particles, so the reaction rate increases.  and the situation: Two colleagues read about types of chemical reactions. Sean studied about the influence of temperature on chemical reactions. Gabe studied about other influencing factors.

It was established in 1685 near Arenosa Creek and Matagorda Bay by explorer Robert Cavelier de La Salle. He intended to found the colony at the mouth of the Mississippi River, but inaccurate maps and navigational errors caused his ships to anchor instead 400 miles (640 km) to the west, off the coast of Texas. The colony survived until 1688. The present-day town of Inez is near the fort's site. The colony faced numerous difficulties during its brief existence, including Native American raids, epidemics, and harsh conditions. From that base, La Salle led several expeditions to find the Mississippi River. These did not succeed, but La Salle did explore much of the Rio Grande and parts of east Texas. During one of his absences in 1686, the colony's last ship was wrecked, leaving the colonists unable to obtain resources from the French colonies of the Caribbean. As conditions deteriorated, La Salle realized the colony could survive only with help from the French settlements in Illinois Country to the north, along the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers. His last expedition ended along the Brazos River in early 1687, when La Salle and five of his men were murdered during a mutiny. Although a handful of men reached Illinois Country, help never made it to the fort. Most of the remaining members of the colony were killed during a Karankawa raid in late 1688, four children survived after being adopted as captives. Although the colony lasted only three years, it established France's claim to possession of the region that is now Texas. The United States later claimed, unsuccessfully, this region as part of the Louisiana Purchase because of the early French colony. Spain learned of La Salle's mission in 1686. Concerned that the French colony could threaten Spain's control over the Viceroyalty of New Spain and the unsettled southeastern region of North America, the Crown funded multiple expeditions to locate and eliminate..., can you guess it ?

And the answer is...","output":"Sure, let's solve the problem step-by-step as if we were solving a little puzzle! So, we've got: -104749*j = -104707*j - 1050 We need to make j all by itself on one side. Let's begin by moving the -104707*j from the right side to the left side of the equation. When we move something across the equals sign (like saying, \\"You! Go to the other side!\\"), we have to change its sign. So, -104707*j changes to positive 104707*j. Our equation now looks like this: -104749*j + 104707*j = -1050 Now, on the left side of the equation, we can combine the -104749*j and the 104707*j (just like if you owe your friend 104749 candies and then you give him 104707 candies back, you would then owe him the difference, which is 42 candies). So, -104749 + 104707 = -42. Therefore, this gives us -42*j on the left side: -42*j = -1050 Next, we want j all by itself, which means getting rid of the -42. We do this by dividing both sides by -42 (it's like saying if you have 42 apples and you equally share them with your friends, how many would everyone have). So, -1050 divided by -42 is: j = 25 And there we have it, j equals to 25! So if you had 25 candies then it would all balance out just right and everyone would be happy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

(A). different meanings (B). the same meaning","output":"In both sentences, the word \\"butt\\" shares the same core meaning, referring to the posterior or buttocks of a person. However, the context in which the word \\"butt\\" is used results in subtle differences in implied meaning. To understand the nuances better, let's take a closer look at each sentence. 1. \\"He deserves a good kick in the butt.\\" In this sentence, \\"butt\\" refers to the person's posterior. The speaker is expressing that the person mentioned should be metaphorically or literally kicked in the buttocks. The kick is acting as a form of punishment or motivation for the person mentioned. The objective here is to emphasize the need for direct action or correction in response to the person's behavior or choices. 2. \\"Get your butt to the car.\\" In this case, \\"butt\\" still refers to the person's posterior, but the speaker is using the word in a more colloquial and informal sense. The speaker is essentially telling the other person to move quickly and get themselves to the car. Here, the term \\"butt\\" is employed as a directive for action, conveying urgency or impatience in the given situation. Although the core meaning of \\"butt\\" is the same, the distinguishing factor lies in the context and intent of the speaker. It's essential to note that language is fluid, and meanings can shift based on context, tone, and intention. Thus, in this scenario, the word \\"butt\\" has the same fundamental definition but is used to express (A) different meanings in each sentence due to context and speaker's intent."},{"instruction":"Q: If pressure is exerted on the rock from one direction, the rock forms layers. this is called what?

Q: Yesterday on my way home, I was following behind a school bus that had a sign in the back of his (or her, not sure of the gender) window saying “no kids on board”. The bus swerved a little bit out of the lane and then continued along just fine. It approached a T shaped intersection with 3 stop signs. The bus and I are going on the top of this T and there’s typically no one ever at this intersection in any direction when I come through. I was surprised to see that he applied brake for a very quick second then continued through the stop sign like it didn’t even exist. I got the whole thing on my dash cam including license plate and vehicle number and not sure if I should share it or not with the school district. On the one hand, there were no children on board at the time (also didn’t see any in any of the windows in addition to the sign), and there typically isn’t anyone at this intersection, so it’s not like they put anyone in danger *at this moment*. However, I do consider this to be dangerous driving. The brief swerve before the stop sign makes me feel like the driver was distracted and didn’t see the sign which is dangerous driving either that or figured no one was around to make stopping necessary. Me, I’m not a school bus driver and I was alone in the car and I stopped at the stop sign because that’s the law and even though no one appeared to be there, I never know if someone will gun it through or be hidden somewhere. I don’t know if he would or would not have done this if children were on board, but this makes me feel like they’re not a great driver and deserve whatever disciplinary action would follow as a result of my sharing of the video.

Write highlights for this article: In the push to free an American woman from a Mexican prison, a video shown in court Thursday could be key. The security camera footage shows Yanira Maldonado and her husband boarding a bus in Mexico last week. They are carrying a purse, two blankets and two bottles of water. It's an everyday scene that plays out at bus stations around the world. But in this case, defense attorney Francisco Benitez argues that the images are a crucial piece of evidence. Why? Because nothing they're carrying, he argues, could hold the amount of marijuana that Yanira Maldonado is accused of smuggling. Maldonado, a Mormon mother of seven, has been in a Mexican jail for more than a week. Authorities accuse her of trying to smuggle 12 pounds of marijuana under a bus seat. She has maintained her innocence, and the case has drawn widespread media coverage and attention from U.S. lawmakers as family members push for her freedom. The revelation of the video comes at a key juncture in the case. A Mexican judge must decide by Friday whether there's enough evidence to charge Maldonado with drug trafficking. If she's not charged, Maldonado must be released, Benitez said. The video footage shown in court Thursday suggests that someone else brought the marijuana aboard the bus, the lawyer said. The packages of marijuana allegedly recovered from under Maldonado's seat would not have fit in her purse, Benitez said. Maldonado's attorneys also presented documents that show that she and her husband, Gary, have no criminal records in the United States, Benitez said. Word that the surveillance video had been shown in court was a big relief, Gary Maldonado told reporters Thursday night. \\"That was the key that would help us prove her innocence,\\" he said. Prosecutors' efforts to say the drugs could be hidden inside the blankets won't win the day, he said. \\"It showed right on the film clear as day there's no way you could carry 12 pounds or 5.7 kilos with one arm. You could see me fold the blankets curled up,\\" he said. The Mexican military officials who arrested Maldonado haven't made their case yet in court. The soldiers were scheduled to appear Wednesday but didn't show. Maldonado's family denies the charges and are optimistic the case against her is crumbling. Mexican authorities arrested Maldonado on May 22 as she and her husband were on their way back to Arizona. Gary Maldonado said he believes Mexican soldiers at the checkpoint wanted a bribe. A Mexican state official also told CNN it appears that Maldonado was framed. A regional office of Mexico's defense ministry said troops conducting a routine investigation stopped the bus Maldonado was riding in and found 12.5 pounds (5.7 kilograms) of a substance that appeared to be marijuana under her seat. Troops turned the case over to the Mexican attorney general's office, the defense ministry said. Maldonado is being housed in a women's prison in Nogales while authorities decide her fate. In an interview Wednesday with CNN, Maldonado said she has been turning to Scripture to survive the ordeal. \\"Reading the Scriptures, reading the Book of Mormon, praying, fasting,\\" Maldonado said. \\"And all the support that I've been getting from my family, my husband, my children and everybody out there reaching out to help.\\" Family members' tearful pleas for her release have drawn widespread media attention to the case and caught the attention of U.S. officials. \\"I am watching this very, very closely,\\" said Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Arizona. \\"After the hearing tomorrow, if I have concerns, I may end up having to go to Mexico myself and get involved in this thing personally.\\" Salmon said he's spoken about the case with the U.S. ambassador to Mexico and Mexico's ambassador in Washington. \\"This case gets stranger by the minute,\\" Salmon said, \\"and I think most Americans as they've been watching it unfold have a lot of concerns.\\" Salmon said witnesses' testimony that Maldonado was only carrying a purse when she got on the bus is among the details that caught his attention. \\"What concerns me more than anything is that I want to make sure justice is met. I want to make sure that she is treated with every courtesy and fairness that we would expect in our own judicial system,\\" he said. State Department officials said consular officials met with Maldonado Wednesday and last Friday, and are in regular contact by phone. U.S. diplomats are doing the same things they usually would when a U.S. citizen is arrested in a foreign country, but maybe to a higher degree because of the high-profile nature of the case, a senior administration official said. On Thursday night, Gary Maldonado said his wife was in good spirits. \\"She was in a good mood,\\" he said. \\"She feels like she was going to get out, since we have the evidence that proves her innocence.\\" CNN's Christine Theodorou, Casey Wian, Elise Labott and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.

Process:  - Air is taken through the mouth - Enters the lungs - The oxygen fills the sacs in your lungs - Carbon dioxide is removed from the lungs and exhaled - The oxygen is pass throughout your body.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a person is panicking happens, how will it affect LESS oxygen reaching the body.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of a person panicking can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of oxygen reaching the body. When a person panics, their breathing pattern is affected, which can interfere with the efficient intake and distribution of oxygen. There are several ways in which this can happen: 1. Rapid breathing (hyperventilation): During a panic attack, a person tends to breathe rapidly, which leads to hyperventilation. Hyperventilation causes the balance between oxygen and carbon dioxide in the body to be disrupted, leading to lower levels of carbon dioxide in the blood. This makes it more difficult for oxygen to be efficiently released from the hemoglobin in red blood cells to the body's tissues, resulting in less oxygen reaching the body. 2. Shallow breathing: In addition to breathing rapidly, a person who is panicking may also take more shallow breaths. This means that the air inhaled is not reaching the deeper parts of the lungs where oxygen exchange is most efficient. As a result, less oxygen is taken in and passed throughout the body. 3. Decreased lung capacity: Anxiety and panic may cause constriction of the airways, making it more difficult for air to pass through and for the lungs to fully expand. This constriction can lead to a decrease in lung capacity, which means that less oxygen is available to be distributed throughout the body. 4. Increased heart rate: During a panic attack, the heart rate typically increases, causing the circulatory system to work harder. This increased demand for oxygen can make it more challenging for the body to provide adequate oxygen to all of its tissues and organs, contributing to the problem of less oxygen reaching the body. Overall, the perturbation caused by panicking can have a significant impact on the process of oxygen reaching the body. The direct effects are primarily due to changes in breathing patterns, while indirect effects may include increased heart rate and decreased lung capacity, making it more difficult for oxygen to be efficiently distributed throughout the body. To overcome the effects of panic on oxygenation, it is important to practice slow, deep breathing techniques and seek appropriate treatment for anxiety and panic disorders."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Mark leaves the meeting after saying he is \\"willing to die, but not of boredom\\" for the cause, which draws criticism from the young white radicals. Following a mass arrest at the campus protest, Mark visits a police station hoping to bail his roommate out of jail. He is told to wait but goes to the lock-up area, asks further about bail for his roommate, is rebuffed, calls out to the arrested students and faculty and is arrested. He gives his name as Karl Marx, which a duty officer types as \\"Carl Marx\\". After he is released from jail, Mark and another friend buy firearms from a Los Angeles gun shop, saying they need them for \\"self-defense\\" to \\"protect our women.\\" In a downtown Los Angeles office building, successful real estate executive Lee Allen reviews a television commercial for Sunny Dunes, a new resort-like real estate development in the desert. Instead of actors or models, the slickly produced commercial features casually dressed, smiling mannequins. In the next scene Allen talks with his associate about the greater Los Angeles area's very rapid growth as the two drive through crowded streets. Mark goes to a bloody campus confrontation between students and police. Some students are tear-gassed and at least one is shot. As Mark reaches for a gun in his boot, a Los Angeles policeman is seen being fatally shot, although it is unclear by whom. Mark flees the campus and rides a city bus to suburban Hawthorne where, after failing to buy a sandwich on credit from a local blue-collar delicatessen, he walks to Hawthorne Municipal Airport, steals a small Cessna 210 aircraft and flies into the desert.  answer the following question:  What was the real name of the person who gave the alias \\"Karl Marx?\\" Answer:","output":"In the context provided, the real name of the person who gave the alias \\"Karl Marx\\" is Mark. It is important to note that this appears to be a fictional story, and Mark is a character within that story rather than a real-life individual."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The attack is interrupted when a meteorite falls from the sky into a nearby car, giving Samantha the chance to escape. As Moses searches the wreck of the car for valuables, his face is scratched by a pale, hairless, eyeless dog-sized creature; the object which fell from the sky was its cocoon. The creature runs away, but the gang chase and kill it. Hoping to gain fame and fortune, they take the corpse to their acquaintance, cannabis dealer Ron (Nick Frost), to get advice on what to do. He lives at the top of their tower block, Wyndham Tower. Moses asks Ron and his boss, Hi-Hatz (Jumayn Hunter), to keep the creature in their fortified \\"weed room\\" while he decides how to proceed. More objects fall from the sky. Eager to fight the creatures, the gang arm themselves and go to the nearest crash site. However, they find these aliens are much larger, gorilla-sized, with spiky fur which is so black it reflects no light, huge claws and rows of glowing fangs. Fleeing the aliens, the gang are intercepted by two policemen and Moses is arrested, identified as a mugger by Samantha. The aliens, following Moses, maul the police to death and attack their van, leaving Samantha and Moses trapped inside. Dennis reaches the vehicle and drives the van away, only to crash into Hi-Hatz's car. Samantha runs away while the rest of Moses's gang catch up and confront Hi-Hatz. Enraged by the damage to his car, Hi-Hatz threatens them with a gun, refusing to believe their story of aliens, until his henchman is attacked by one, allowing the gang to escape. The gang try to flee to Wyndham Tower but are again followed and attacked en route by the aliens, where Biggz is forced to hide in a dumpster and Pest is severely bitten in the leg. They find...

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Gilmour recorded his second solo album, About Face, in 1984, and used it to express his feelings about a variety of topics, from the murder of John Lennon to his relationship with Waters. He later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd. Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity, which went almost unnoticed upon its release. Mason released his second solo album, Profiles, in August 1985.Following the release of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, Waters publicly insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite. He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments. O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, which angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager. He terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia announcing he had left the band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations. Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd. Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract—which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended—and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him. He then went to the High Court in an effort to dissolve the band and prevent the use of the Pink Floyd name, declaring Pink Floyd \\"a spent force creatively.\\" When his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to obtain a veto over further use of the band's name. Gilmour responded by issuing a carefully worded press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write highlights for this article: Wrapped in heavy coats against the November chill, thousands of visitors crowd onto the paths circling the Tower of London to catch a glimpse of the extraordinary \\"sea\\" of crimson filling the castle's moat below. The blood-red tide which flows from one of the palace's windows and laps at its ancient stone walls is made of hundreds of thousands of individually handcrafted ceramic poppies. Each of the 888,246 blooms in the artwork, \\"Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red,\\" represents a life lost in World War I -- one for each of the British and Colonial soldiers killed in the conflict that began 100 years ago. And as Britain commemorates Armistice Day in the war's centenary year, the final poppy will be \\"planted\\" shortly before 11am on November 11, the time at which the armistice was signed, ending the war in 1918. Once the evolving artwork, which began with the planting of the first poppy by Tower of London Yeoman Warder Crawford Butler on July 17, is \\"complete\\" a lone bugler will play the Last Post, signaling the start of two minutes' silence in memory of the war dead. Less than 24 hours later, the army of thousands of volunteers who helped put it together will sweep in and begin dismantling it, \\"picking\\" each flower. The poppies will then be checked, cleaned and packed before being shipped to their new owners -- each has been sold, for Â£25 (about 40), to benefit six armed forces charities. But following widespread calls for the hugely popular installation to remain in place longer, even until 2018, leaving them at the Tower for the duration of the WWI anniversary, organizers said two parts of the display would be kept in place until the end of November. The \\"weeping window\\" and the \\"wave\\" of poppies across the path leading into the Tower will then be taken on a tour of the UK, before becoming part of the permanent exhibitions at the Imperial War Museums in London and Manchester. Historic Royal Palaces (HRP), the organization which runs the Tower of London, tweeted: \\"We're pleased to confirm that these two major features of the #TowerPoppies will be going on national tour until 2018.\\" HRP says in excess of 4 million people -- between 60,000 and 70,000 a day -- are expected to have visited the installation by the time it ends. In a statement, British Prime Minister David Cameron said: \\"The poppy display at the Tower of London has in a very short space of time become a much loved and respected monument. \\"We want to ensure that as many people as possible have the opportunity to witness it ... By displaying parts of the installation around the country and then permanently in the Imperial War Museum, we have ensured that this poignant memorial will be saved for the nation.\\" The HRP spokeswoman told CNN that the display's creators, ceramic artist Paul Cummins and theater designer Tom Piper, had always intended it to be an evolving memorial. \\"That was very much part of the artists' intentions, the transient nature of it, as is the idea that it will then be dispersed, that the poppies will find new homes,\\" she said. HRP and Transport for London have warned those heading to the Tower to see the poppies in their last days and weeks that there are likely to be large crowds in the area, and that public transport and Tube stations nearby will be far busier than usual. In order to allow more people to experience it, the artwork has been illuminated until midnight each evening. There are reports that some of those who have bought the blooms are trying to cash in on the enormous popularity of the installation by selling their flowers on internet auction site eBay for more than double their original price. An eBay spokesman told Britain's Daily Mail newspaper that such inappropriate listings would be canceled. Cameron praised all of those involved in the \\"extraordinary project,\\" which he said had \\"brought forward from the British public a huge amount of reverence for those who have given their lives and served our country.\\" \\"The numbers going to see this display have been truly extraordinary,\\" he said at the weekly Prime Minister's Questions session in parliament, adding that money raised from the sale of the poppies was likely to fund valuable work by veterans' charities. Poppies have been used as a way of commemorating World War I for decades -- in Britain, thousands of paper flowers are sold for charity each year to be worn in people's lapels. The flowers grew over the battlefields of northern France and Belgium, inspiring one of the most famous poems written about the conflict, by John McCrae: \\"In Flanders fields the poppies blow, Between the crosses, row on row ...\\" READ MORE: Poppy hijab honors Muslims, sparks controversy.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Juan Alberto Gonzalez Vazquez (born October 20, 1969), nicknamed \\"Igor\\", is a former Major League Baseball right fielder. During his 16 years in the league, Gonzalez played for four teams, but is more remembered for his two stints with the Texas Rangers (1989-1999, 2002-2003). One of the premier run producers and most feared hitters of the 1990s, Gonzalez averaged 37 HR and 117 runs batted in per season from 1991 to 1999. He won the AL MVP award twice in that time span, 1996 and 1998. Gonzalez grew up in a rough area of Puerto Rico, where he learned to hit bottlecaps and corks with a broomstick handle in the Alto de Cuba barrio. In the Puerto Rico youth league, Gonzalez batted cleanup behind future Yankee center fielder Bernie Williams, where both competed against Gonzalez's future teammate Ivan Rodriguez. When the Yankees scouted Williams, eventually signing him, they declined to pursue Gonzalez, who they perceived as not serious about baseball.  The Texas Rangers signed Gonzalez as an amateur free agent on May 30, 1986, at the age of 16. Gonzalez has always wanted to serve as a role model for the kids of Puerto Rico, as they are faced with the downfalls of drugs and prostitution frequently. Gonzalez avoided such temptations growing up. His father, a math teacher, and mother, a housewife, made sure Gonzalez and his two sisters behaved properly and stayed away from negative influences. Gonzalez moved his family out of the barrio early in his MLB career. He paid utility bills for down-on-their-luck friends and plans on working to construct recreation facilities and a baseball diamond in his home town. One of Juan's managers, Johnny Oates, believed that until you've walked where Juan Gonzalez has walked, you just won't understand. Speaking from experience, as Oates has walked the streets of Vega Baja, Puerto Rico, during visits multiple times, he had this to say: \\"I don't think you can appreciate how far he's come until you've been there\\", Oates said. \\"We might be making choices between going to the movies or going to the skating rink. But look at the choices the kids there were faced with growing up - do you want to do drugs or get beaten up? I think it says so much about him that he was able to rise above the peer pressure in Vega Baja. He had enough intelligence to say, 'I don't want to do that.'\\"  In Puerto Rico he is known as \\"Igor\\", the nickname he has carried since he was a nine-year-old fascinated by the professional wrestler \\"Igor the Magnificent.\\" \\"I watched wrestling all the time and I still like it\\", Gonzalez said. \\"One day when I was nine, I told another guy, 'I'm Igor.' And he said,'Okay, your name is Igor from now on.' And I've been Igor since then.\\" Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Did he help coach any youth sports?","output":"The information provided does not mention whether Juan Alberto Gonzalez Vazquez, also known as \\"Igor\\", helped coach any youth sports."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plants like cacti have thick and fleshy stems, which are designed to store water during periods of drought. The water-storing capacity of the stem, combined with the plant's ability to perform photosynthesis in the absence of leaves, allows desert plants to conserve precious water resources efficiently. While some other plants may store water in their leaves or branches, the stem is the most common and effective location for desert plants to store water. The adaptability of these plants enables them to grow in harsh environments where water is scarce. In addition to the well-known cactus species, other desert plants like euphorbias and aloes also store water in their stems to survive in arid conditions. Some plants, such as the succulents, can store water in both their leaves and stems, further increasing their capacity to withstand droughts. In contrast, answer choices like \\"In the spines,\\" \\"peachleaf willow,\\" \\"scarce resources,\\" \\"bamboo,\\" and \\"In the branches\\" do not accurately address the question, as they do not describe the typical water storage strategies employed by desert plants. While some cacti do have spines, these are for protection, not for storing water. In conclusion, \\"In the stem\\" is the best answer, as it accurately reflects the primary method of water storage in desert plants such as cacti, which are well-adapted to thrive in hot and dry environments. Their ability to store significant amounts of water in their stems allows them to survive in environments where other plants struggle to exist."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Process:  - As the sweat evaporates the sweat sheds molecules into the air - The sweat changes into a gas - Heat is drawn from the sweat - This process draws heat from the body - The evaporation also cools the remaining sweat on the body.  suppose earth doesn't have a volcano happens, how will it affect MORE body cooling occurring.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"If the Earth does not experience any volcanic activity, it could lead to indirect impacts on the body cooling process. The absence of volcanoes may result in alterations to the Earth's climate system, which could in turn affect the evaporation process and our body's ability to cool itself. This perturbation could indirectly impact the steps of the process. A change in the Earth's climate, due to the lack of volcanic activity, could have a variety of consequences. One possibility is that the planet becomes warmer overall, due to the absence of the sulfate aerosols that are released into the atmosphere during volcanic eruptions. These aerosols reflect sunlight and thus have a cooling effect on the Earth's temperature. If the Earth became warmer, this could affect the body cooling process in different ways. In warmer conditions, our bodies may need to work harder to maintain a stable internal temperature. This increased effort could cause more sweating and a greater need for efficient evaporation. On the other hand, if the lack of volcanic activity were to cause a drop in Earth's temperature, our body cooling process could be impacted in the opposite way. In cooler conditions, our bodies might not require as much sweating to maintain a comfortable temperature, and so the process of evaporation and shedding molecules into the air could become less important. It's also possible that regional climates would react differently to the absence of volcanic activity. Some areas might become warmer, while others could become cooler or more humid, which would affect how our bodies respond to these changes. In summary, while the absence of volcanic activity on Earth does not directly impact the steps in the body cooling process, it could indirectly impact the process by altering the Earth's climate system. This change could either increase or decrease the need for efficient body cooling, depending on various factors such as regional climate, overall temperature changes, and the body's adapted mechanisms against these alterations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Matt Warren, of Swansea's TechHub and the Veeqo online retail firm, called on the Welsh Government to offer more loans as well as grants and for Finance Wales to become less \\"risk averse\\". He said high risk business was needed for growth and employment. But Finance Wales said it was committed to fostering a vibrant and positive technology sector in Wales. Mr Warren made the calls as his firm Veeqo, which helps online retailers increase profit by managing orders across different websites like Amazon and Ebay, launched an online campaign to raise £2m from venture capitalists. Established in 2013 in Mr Warren's kitchen, the company now employs 30 people, and has a £1m revenue. In 2014, it received a £50,000 Welsh Government Digital Development Fund grant, which Mr Warren said helped him attract private investment. But he has now called on the Welsh Government to introduce more repayable loans, as well as grants. \\"The sort of companies who are interested in grants don't tend to be the ones who want to grow really big,\\" he said. \\"With a loan, the company is going to have spend the money well and think really hard about what they want to do with it.\\" Finance Wales need to become more innovative, he said, and added that the institution is \\"government-led and risk averse.\\" \\"The tech industry is high risk, but it brings big rewards,\\" he added. \\"Finance Wales tend to invest in more low-risk, traditional industries. But these aren't the companies who are going to employ thousands of people in the future.\\" But Steve Smith, technology venture investments director at Finance Wales, said a number of funds support new digital firms, including the £10m Wales technology venture investment fund and the £7.5m technology seed fund, both backed by the Welsh Government. Finance Wales also have a team who specialise in helping early stage technology companies. He said: \\"Since April this year, this team has invested over £5.5m in nearly 30 Welsh companies. An active co-investor, our investments are usually matched by the private sector. \\"We're committed to fostering a vibrant and positive technology sector in Wales.\\" And a Welsh Government spokesperson said Veeqo had \\"thrived with their support\\". It said it was aiming to launch a Development Bank of Wales next year, and that latest figures showed \\"above average survival rates\\" for companies backed by the Welsh Government. The spokesperson added: \\"We are always seeking to improve, and are currently working on refreshing our economic priorities so we can continue to build a fairer, more prosperous, and more secure Wales. \\"Business finance is one of many issues being considered as part of this work.\\" Veeqo's growth reflects a rise in Swansea's digital sector. The city's TechHub, which Mr Warren co-founded, houses 20 digital start-ups, employing up to 300 people. Swansea is set to be the first area of Wales to receive an ultra fast broadband connection, the city council plan to set up a 'city digital district', and Swansea could be home to the world's largest interactive digital screens for learning about science and technology. Prof Paul Hannon, director of Swansea University's institute for entrepreneurial leadership, said: \\"Matt's success with Veeqo is an inspiring story that will provide further encouragement to Welsh small to medium enterprises (SMEs) looking to take their businesses to the next level, which will undoubtedly add significant value to our local economy.\\"","output":"Swansea-based online retail firm, Veeqo, has called on the Welsh Government to offer more loans and grants to tech start-ups in Wales to support growth and employment; it has also suggested Finance Wales should be more open to riskier investments in the technology sector."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which city disrupted fewer ocean food webs?  Bend city used a lot of fossil fuels to generate electricity. Hop city, another city from the same county, used only alternative sources of energy.  Hint: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. It’s rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Hop city disrupted fewer ocean food webs. The reasoning behind this can be derived from the information given about the two cities' energy sources and their potential impact on the ozone layer. Bend city utilized a significant amount of fossil fuels to generate electricity, which contributes to air pollution. This pollution can result in the release of chlorine and bromine gases, which are identified as the primary culprits in the destruction of the ozone layer. The loss of ozone has several consequences, including the disturbance of the nitrogen cycle, the death of plankton, and disruption of ocean food webs. On the other hand, Hop city used only alternative sources of energy instead of fossil fuels. Alternative energy sources typically have a lower impact on air pollution levels and do not result in the release of harmful gases like fossil fuels. Therefore, Hop city's use of alternative energy sources likely contributed less to the depletion of the ozone layer and, as a result, disrupted fewer ocean food webs than Bend city. The hint in the passage highlights the negative effects of air pollution on the ozone layer and the consequences for life on Earth, including implications for ocean food webs. Using this information, it is clear that Hop city, with its use of cleaner alternative energy sources, disrupted fewer ocean food webs than Bend city, which relied on polluting fossil fuels."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a hypothesis: I did not think that John Cavendish loved his wife. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"In analyzing the given premise and hypothesis, it is important to determine their compatibility and if one can lead to the other. Based on the premise and hypothesis provided, the compatibility is as follows: Premise: That John Cavendish still loved his wife, I was convinced.  Hypothesis: I did not think that John Cavendish loved his wife. The premise states that the belief is that John Cavendish still loves his wife, while the hypothesis contradicts the premise by stating that the belief is that he does not love his wife.  To conclude whether the hypothesis can be true if the premise is true, we must examine the logical relationship between the two statements. In this case, the two statements represent contradictory beliefs.  In the realm of logic, there are four different ways two statements can relate to each other: contradiction, contrariety, subcontrariety, and subalternation. Contradiction occurs when both statements cannot be true and cannot be false at the same time. In other words, if one statement is true, the other must be false, and vice versa. Contrariety occurs when both statements cannot be true but can be false at the same time. Subcontrariety occurs when both statements can be true but cannot be false at the same time. Subalternation occurs when the truth of one statement implies the truth of another, while the falsity of that latter statement implies the falsity of the former. Since the hypothesis directly opposes the premise, they are in a relationship of contradiction. As a result, we cannot conclude that if the premise is true, the hypothesis would also be true. If the premise holds, then John Cavendish still loves his wife. In this case, the hypothesis, which claims that John Cavendish does not love his wife, would be false. If the premise is indeed true, the hypothesis must be false due to the contradictory nature of the relationship between the two statements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There are different opinions on plastic and paper. Now let's follow the travels of 3 plastic bags. It begins at the grocery store with the customer's choice. Plastic Bag 1: As the waste engineer come by and pick up the trash, the first plastic bag falls out. It sits on a small street for a couple of hours until a car comes along and takes it down to the road. Then a gust of wind blows it across the road, then another car, then another gust of wind finally makes its way to the beach. Water fills the plastic bag and makes it look like a jellyfish. A seal  swims by, thinking it looks very interesting, and swallowed it. The plastic bag may stay in the seal's stomach for months, maybe years. You see, our lovely animals have been living thousands of years in a world where everything can be eaten. Plastic Bag 2: This bag does make its way to landfill . Before they have a chance to cover up the thousands of pounds of daily waste, a strong wind comes up and blows these plastic bags out of the landfill. Once the wind stops, workers will be sent to collect thousands of bags around. But they can't possibly get them all. So our little bag continues his adventure getting caught in trees, eaten by birds or making its way to our lakes or rivers. Plastic Bag 3: The last bag also blows away but is caught in a landfill where it sits for many years, as all the trash is wrapped in a big plastic bag, making natural degradation  impossible.

They are related to different aspects of web development using HTML and CSS. Let me explain each question in detail. 1. How do you create a box filled with a color with HTML / CSS? This question pertains to creating a rectangular box with a specified background color using HTML and CSS. To achieve this, you need to create an HTML element with a specific width and height and apply CSS styles to add background color. Here's an example: HTML: \`\`\`html <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\\"en\\"> <head>   <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\">   <meta name=\\"viewport\\" content=\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\">   <title>Colored Box Example</title>   <link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"styles.css\\"> </head> <body>   <div class=\\"colored-box\\"></div> </body> </html> \`\`\` CSS (styles.css): \`\`\`css .colored-box {   width: 200px;   height: 200px;   background-color: blue; } \`\`\` In this example, the \`<div>\` element with the class \\"colored-box\\" is given a width and height of 200 pixels and assigned a background color of blue. 2. \\"I made an excellent contact form. How do I make it (using HTML and CSS), that when someone hits 'submit', the filled-out form gets emailed to me?\\" This question is related to creating a functional contact form that sends an email to the specified email address when the form is submitted. To achieve this, you need to use HTML to create the form elements and CSS to style the form. However, just using HTML and CSS is not enough to send an email from the form submission. You'll need to use some server-side logic (e.g., PHP, Node.js, etc.) to handle the email sending process or use a third-party service like Formspree or Netlify. Here's an example using Formspree: HTML: \`\`\`html <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\\"en\\"> <head>   <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\">   <meta name=\\"viewport\\" content=\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\">   <title>Contact Form Example</title>   <link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"styles.css\\"> </head> <body>   <form action=\\"https://formspree.io/YOUREMAILHERE\\" method=\\"POST\\">     <label for=\\"name\\">       Name:       <input type=\\"text\\" id=\\"name\\" name=\\"name\\" required>     </label>          <label for=\\"email\\">       Email:       <input type=\\"email\\" id=\\"email\\" name=\\"email\\" required>     </label>          <label for=\\"message\\">       Message:       <textarea id=\\"message\\" name=\\"message\\" rows=\\"4\\" required></textarea>     </label>          <button type=\\"submit\\">Submit</button>   </form> </body> </html> \`\`\` CSS (styles.css): \`\`\`css form {   display: flex;   flex-direction: column;   width: 300px; } label {   margin-bottom: 10px; } input, textarea {   width: 100%; } button {   background-color: blue;   color: white;   font-size: 1rem;   padding: 5px;   cursor: pointer; } button:hover {   background-color: darkblue; } \`\`\` In this example, a contact form with input fields for name, email, and message is created, and the form submission process is handled by Formspree. You should replace \\"YOUREMAILHERE\\" with your email address.

Background: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ).  Paragraph: There was a soccer match between Red team and Blue team. Blue team got there early, warmed up properly and were ready for the game. Red team arrived late and almost skipped warming up entirely. Costly decision, as it turns out, because they lost.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which team had less people with an increased blood flow to the muscles before the match? The answer to this question is:","output":"The Red team.  The reason for this is that the Red team arrived late and almost skipped their warm-up entirely according to the text.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Although your body requires sodium in small amounts, consuming too much sodium is bad for you and can lead to hypertension, heart disease and stroke. If you suffer from high blood pressure, take steps to reduce your sodium intake:  Do not add salt to foods when cooking but use other spices instead (cumin, lemon pepper, fresh herbs). Rinse canned foods to remove sodium. Buy foods that are labeled “low sodium” or “sodium free.” Avoid processed foods, such as crackers, fried items, and baked goods, that often are high in sodium. Also avoid eating fast food and ask for reduced sodium when ordering in restaurants. A high fiber diet may help reduce your risk of hypertension. Fortunately, it’s easy to get fiber from the healthy foods you’re likely already eating. Incorporate more whole grains, fresh veggies, and fruit with the skin on it into your diet. This will help you consume at least 25 grams of fiber each day.  Make sure you get at least six to eight servings of whole grains every day. Switch refined grains to whole grains, such as brown rice and whole wheat pasta and bread. Potassium-rich foods should be a part of your hypertension management diet. Foods you should add include sweet potatoes, tomatoes, kidney beans, orange juice, bananas, peas, potatoes, dried fruits, melon and cantaloupe. Keep your target potassium levels moderate (around 2,000 to 4,000 mg a day). Dark chocolate may help lower blood pressure, though it might not work the same for everyone. Eat dark chocolate whenever you’re craving a treat. Choose a bar that has at least 70% cocoa.  Eat a half an ounce of dark chocolate that has at least 70% of cocoa per day.  Because dark chocolate is high in calories, be sure not to overindulge. Besides being bad for blood pressure, caffeine and alcohol also have other negative health effects to you and your baby during pregnancy. Thus, you should avoid both, especially if you suffer from high blood pressure.  Drinking caffeine during pregnancy has been linked to declined placental blood flow and a risk of miscarriage. Although more studies are needed to confirm the effects of caffeine, it is best to switch to decaf during your pregnancy.  High alcohol consumption is known to raise blood pressure and it is also known to have negative effects on your unborn baby. Before drinking any alcohol, even just one glass of wine, consult your doctor. A clinical study demonstrated that systolic blood pressure can be lowered by adding these foods to your diet.  Add low-fat or fat-free dairy products (such as milk, cottage cheese, yogurt) to your diet. If you are lactose intolerant, try a milk alternative, such as almond, coconut, or hemp milk.  You can also try soy milk, but you may want to limit soy products during pregnancy since it may increase estrogen levels in your fetus.  Go easy on the amount of cheese you eat (even low-fat) due to their high sodium content.","output":"The article provides dietary recommendations to reduce hypertension, such as lowering sodium intake, increasing fiber and potassium consumption, incorporating dark chocolate, avoiding caffeine and alcohol during pregnancy, and adding low-fat dairy products to one's diet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They were called Protestants and Catholics. A wise man named Michael Evans wanted to help these people become friends, so he came up with a great idea. Michael thought that high school was a good place to start making friends. So, he put both Protestant and Catholic students together on one team.

Maybe it was a little scary at first, but Michael believed that if people worked together and had fun, they would become friends. And guess what? It worked! Even after these students graduated from high school, they still stayed friends with each other. They didn't let their differences stop them from caring about one another. Now, Northern Ireland can be a bit dangerous sometimes because of the disagreements between the two groups. This means that sometimes the friends cannot visit each other in person. But do you think that stopped them? No way! Instead, they found a way to keep talking to each other using something called the Internet. With the help of computers or smartphones, they can send messages and share pictures, just like magic! Even though they can't always see each other face-to-face, they still make sure to let their friends know they care.

Jumpers and throwers, on the other hand, rely heavily on strength, flexibility, and coordination. It's essential to assess your strengths and weaknesses to determine which event may best align with your abilities. 2. Personal preferences: Track and field is a diverse sport offering a wide range of events, from sprints and hurdles to jumps and throws. It's crucial to consider your interests and what you enjoy most about athletics. If you prefer racing against the clock, you may be more suited to sprinting or middle-distance events. Conversely, if you enjoy testing your limits in jumps or throws, those events may be more to your liking. 3. Experience: Your previous experience in track and field can help determine the most suitable event for you. If you have consistently excelled in a specific event or find that you gravitate toward particular activities during training, this could be a strong indicator of where your talents lie. Additionally, consider seeking feedback from your coaches, teammates, or other experienced athletes who can offer objective opinions on your performance in different events. By examining these factors, you can better identify the track and field event that aligns with your abilities and preferences. If you are still unsure, consider experimenting with several events, either by participating in multiple competitions or by focusing on one for a season before trying another. This exploratory approach can help you gain exposure to various aspects of track and field and ultimately enable you to pinpoint the event that is the best fit for you."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Jarmusch was born January 22, 1953, in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, the middle of three children of middle-class suburbanites. His mother, of German and Irish descent, had been a reviewer of film and theatre for the Akron Beacon Journal before marrying his father, a businessman of Czech and German descent who worked for the B.F. Goodrich Company. She introduced Jarmusch to the world of cinema by leaving him at a local cinema to watch matinee double features such as Attack of the Crab Monsters and Creature From the Black Lagoon while she ran errands. The first adult film he recalls seeing was the 1958 cult classic Thunder Road, the violence and darkness of which left an impression on the seven-year-old Jarmusch. Jarmusch's final year university project was completed in 1980 as Permanent Vacation, his first feature film. It had its premiere at the International Filmfestival Mannheim-Heidelberg (formerly known as Filmweek Mannheim) and won the Josef von Sternberg Award. It was made on a shoestring budget of around 12,000 in misdirected scholarship funds and shot by cinematographer Tom DiCillo on 16 mm film. The 75 minute quasi-autobiographical feature follows an adolescent drifter (Chris Parker) as he wanders around downtown Manhattan.  The film was not released theatrically, and did not attract the sort of adulation from critics that greeted his later work. The Washington Post staff writer Hal Hinson would disparagingly comment in an aside during a review of Jarmusch's Mystery Train (1989) that in the director's debut, \\"the only talent he demonstrated was for collecting egregiously untalented actors\\". The bleak and unrefined Permanent Vacation is nevertheless one of the director's most personal films, and established many of the hallmarks he would exhibit in his later work, including derelict urban settings, chance encounters, and a wry sensibility.  Jarmusch's first major film, Stranger Than Paradise, was produced on a budget of approximately 125,000 and released in 1984 to much critical acclaim. A deadpan comedy recounting a strange journey of three disillusioned youths from New York through Cleveland to Florida, the film broke many conventions of traditional Hollywood filmmaking. It was awarded the Camera d'Or at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival as well as the 1985 National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Film, and became a landmark work in modern independent film.  In 1986, Jarmusch wrote and directed Down by Law, starring musicians John Lurie and Tom Waits, and Italian comic actor Roberto Benigni (his introduction to American audiences) as three convicts who escape from a New Orleans jailhouse. Shot like the director's previous efforts in black and white, this constructivist neo-noir was Jarmusch's first collaboration with Dutch cinematographer Robby Muller, who had been known for his work with Wenders.  His next two films each experimented with parallel narratives: Mystery Train (1989) told three successive stories set on the same night in and around a small Memphis hotel, and Night on Earth (1991) involved five cab drivers and their passengers on rides in five different world cities, beginning at sundown in Los Angeles and ending at sunrise in Helsinki. Less bleak and somber than Jarmusch's earlier work, Mystery Train nevertheless retained the director's askance conception of America. He wrote Night on Earth in about a week, out of frustration at the collapse of the production of another film he had written and the desire to visit and collaborate with friends such as Benigni, Gena Rowlands, Winona Ryder and Isaach de Bankole.  As a result of his early work, Jarmusch became an influential representative of the trend of the American road movie. Not intended to appeal to mainstream filmgoers, these early Jarmusch films were embraced by art house audiences, gaining a small but dedicated American following and cult status in Europe and Japan. Each of the four films had its premiere at the New York Film Festival, while Mystery Train was in competition at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival. Jarmusch's distinctive aesthetic and auteur status fomented a critical backlash at the close of this early period, however; though reviewers praised the charm and adroitness of Mystery Train and Night On Earth, the director was increasingly charged with repetitiveness and risk-aversion.  A film appearance in 1989 as a used car dealer in the cult comedy Leningrad Cowboys Go America further solidified his interest and participation in the road movie genre. In 1991 Jarmusch appeared as himself in Episode One of John Lurie's cult television series Fishing With John.  In 1995, Jarmusch released Dead Man, a period film set in the 19th century American West starring Johnny Depp and Gary Farmer. Produced at a cost of almost 9 million with a high-profile cast including John Hurt, Gabriel Byrne and, in his final role, Robert Mitchum, the film marked a significant departure for the director from his previous features. Earnest in tone in comparison to its self-consciously hip and ironic predecessors, Dead Man was thematically expansive and of an often violent and progressively more surreal character. The film was shot in black and white by Robby Muller, and features a score composed and performed by Neil Young, for whom Jarmusch subsequently filmed the tour documentary Year of the Horse, released to tepid reviews in 1997.  Though ill-received by mainstream American reviewers, Dead Man found much favor internationally and among critics, many of whom lauded it as a visionary masterpiece. It has been hailed as one of the few films made by a Caucasian that presents an authentic Native American culture and character, and Jarmusch stands by it as such, though it has attracted both praise and castigation for its portrayal of the American West, violence, and especially Native Americans.  Following artistic success and critical acclaim in the American independent film community, he achieved mainstream recognition with his far-East philosophical crime film Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai, shot in Jersey City and starring Forest Whitaker as a young inner-city man who has found purpose for his life by unyieldingly conforming it to the Hagakure, an 18th-century philosophy text and training manual for samurai, becoming, as directed, a terrifyingly deadly hit-man for a local mob boss to whom he may owe a debt, and who then betrays him. The soundtrack was supplied by RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan, which blends into the director's \\"aesthetics of sampling\\". The film was unique among other things for the number of books important to and discussed by its characters, most of them listed bibliographically as part of the end credits. The film is also considered to be a homage to Le Samourai, a 1967 French New Wave film by auteur Jean-Pierre Melville, which starred renowned French actor Alain Delon in a strikingly similar role and narrative.

IKEA drives home reality of war with replica of Syrian dwelling Eager shoppers walking through IKEA's flagship Norway store were not expecting to find a spartan dwelling with bare walls among the furniture-maker’s display rooms. The Swedish furniture store collaborated with Red Cross to construct a 25 square-metre replica of an actual Syrian family's home in war-torn Damascus. It aimed to give people a tangible experience of life in the battered country, where many families live in bombed-out buildings with limited access to medicine and heating during the cold winter months. The home - which visitors can walk through as they would any other of the store's displays - is totally bare apart from a few rugs and humble furnishings. Rana, a mother of four young children, calls a similar tiny two-bedroom apartment in the suburb of Jaramana home. \\"When we had to flee to this area to find safety, we did not have enough money to rent a better place. We have no money to buy mattresses and blankets, or clothes for the children,\\" she told the Red Cross. The creative agency behind the fundraising activity said they were determined to make the experience as authentic as possible, and even built the house from concrete on site. \\"It would have been easier to put up wallpaper, but it wouldn't have felt the same,\\" art director Snorre Martinsen told AdWeek. \\"People who had fled war themselves have told us, 'This is how it feels, I remember this',\\". The installation, which was open to the public for two weeks, raised more than 22 million euros (A31.5 million) for Red Cross' efforts in Syria, with IKEA's iconic plastic price tags serving as donation slips. © Nine Digital Pty Ltd 2016 What was this article about?","output":"This article is about a unique collaboration between IKEA and the Red Cross to raise awareness about the living conditions of Syrian families in war-torn Damascus.

During the 186-day mission mission, Maj Peake also remotely steered a robot on Earth and ran the London Marathon. Just before 15:00 BST, Maj Peake landed by helicopter on the runway at Karagandy airport. But neither he nor his American colleague Tim Kopra made it to the subsequent press conference. They were presumed to be tired after their gruelling return journey. Later on Saturday, a Nasa gulfstream jet is due to fly Tim Peake to Norway. He will then go on to Cologne, Germany, where the European Astronaut Centre is based. His mission has taken him on about 3,000 orbits of Earth, covering a distance of about 125 million km. Asked how he felt after landing, Maj Peake said: \\"Truly elated, the smells of Earth are just so strong, just so good to be back on Earth. I'll look forward to seeing the family.\\" The spacecraft turned over several times after it landed relatively hard due to the wind speed on the Kazakh steppe.

At about 03:35 BST on Saturday, Maj Peake, Russian cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko and Col Kopra made their farewells and entered the Russian Soyuz TMA-19M space capsule to return home from the International Space Station. After undocking at 06:53 BST, the Soyuz performed two separation burns to distance the spacecraft from the orbiting outpost. The vehicle then fired its engines again at 09:22 for a duration of four-and-a-half minutes to begin the re-entry through the atmosphere. Screaming towards Earth at 25 times the speed of sound, the Soyuz was enveloped in a fiery ball of superheated plasma. During this phase, the crew members inside can be subjected to forces of about 5Gs - a level at which some people pass out. As it neared the ground, the capsule deployed its parachutes to slow the descent, firing engines to cushion its landing on the steppe, near the Kazakh city of Dzhezkazgan at 10:15 BST. Dr Simon Evetts, from the UK's Harwell Science and Innovation Campus, said: \\"During re-entry, Tim will undergo significant strain on his body and will also feel the effects of his landmark mission for weeks to come. \\"Upon arrival, Tim will feel weaker due to muscle loss and reduced cardiovascular fitness, and will feel heavy in Earth's gravity.\\" Tim Peake in space: Want to know more?

Protein helps your body build and repair muscle cells and connective tissue. You also need protein to help transport nutrients throughout your body. Not getting enough protein can lead to your muscles breaking down over time, resulting in lower strength and energy.  Elite endurance athletes should be consuming 1.3 to 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight each day. Resistance athletes should be consuming between 1.0 and 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight each day. Remember that pounds are approximately double the weight in kilograms. For example, a 150-pound (68-kilogram) endurance athlete should be eating about 92 to 108 grams of protein each day. Some foods contain more protein than others. How much protein-rich food you eat will depend on your dietary needs and the foods you choose to eat.  To get 10 grams of protein from animal foods, you would need to eat either two eggs, 1.5 slices of cheese, one cup (250 milliliters) of milk, 40 grams of lean chicken, 50 grams of fish, or 200 grams of yogurt. To get 10 grams of protein from plant sources, you would need to eat either four slices of wholemeal bread, three cups of whole grain cereal, two cups of pasta, three cups of rice, 120 grams of tofu, 100 grams of soy \\"meat,\\" or 3/4 cup lentils. In addition to getting enough protein, you should ensure that you're consuming protein at the optimal times. You need protein throughout the day, but you should also boost your protein intake after training or competing.  Ingesting large amounts of protein immediately after exercising helps your body take up and retain more amino acids. This, in turn, will help your body recover from exercise and repair muscle as needed. Make sure you continue to eat enough protein throughout the rest of the day. The increased uptake and retention of amino acids from protein consumed right after exercise will continue for up to 24 hours. This means that your protein source for breakfast will be used as rapidly as the protein you ate after a workout last night.","output":"This article emphasizes the importance of consuming adequate protein for muscle building and repair, outlining daily intake recommendations for endurance and resistance athletes, and suggesting various animal and plant sources of protein, as well as the benefits of ingesting protein after exercise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Furthermore, steel-cut oats are nutritionally superior due to their minimal processing and higher fiber content, thus providing a higher degree of sustained energy release and making them an ideal choice for individuals seeking a healthy and hearty breakfast option that not only tastes exceptional but also promotes overall well-being. Additionally, steel-cut oats have a lower glycemic index compared to their quick-cook counterparts, which contributes to better blood sugar control and aids in weight management efforts, especially for those with diabetes or prediabetes. In the culinary realm, steel-cut oats offer an elevated versatility that encourages creativity in the kitchen, allowing for a wide range of savory and sweet dishes that extend beyond the traditional bowl of oatmeal and prove that a nutritious, satisfying meal need not be mundane nor time-consuming. With these myriad benefits in mind, it becomes increasingly clear why steel-cut oats warrant a prominent place in the modern, health-conscious diet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is typical of right wing ignorance that a foreign enemy is needed as a stand-in for a real agenda. China will liberalize as globalism and the Internet take hold. Americans will not be tricked into a new cold war. These authors are as looney as Bill Gertz. Freak show journalists, with mail order educations. Is this product review negative? Answer:","output":"Yes, this product review is negative. The reviewer expresses strong disapproval and criticism of the book \\"Disinformation and Resentment,\\" stating that it is a politically motivated screed authored by individuals who long for the tensions of the Cold War era. The review labels the book as a representation of \\"right-wing ignorance\\" and finds flaws in the authors' agenda, suggesting that they are using China as a scapegoat for their political objectives of promoting a new cold war. Furthermore, the reviewer argues that the authors' views are outdated, as they believe that globalism and the internet will eventually lead China towards liberalization. This statement implies that the reviewer disagrees with the perspective put forth in the book and is optimistic about the potential for global interconnectedness to foster political and social change in China. In addition to criticizing the book's content and ideology, the reviewer also attacks the authors personally, labeling them as \\"looney\\" and comparing them to Bill Gertz, implying that the authors are unreasonable and extreme in their viewpoints. The reviewer goes so far as to discredit the authors' credentials by calling them \\"freak show journalists\\" with \\"mail-order educations,\\" casting doubt on their expertise and knowledge. Overall, the tone of this product review is dismissive and derogatory, with the reviewer providing a harsh assessment of both the book's content and the credibility of its authors.

Our present concern is with how easily and to what extent this cycle can be modified. The question is no mere academic one. The ease, for example, with which people can change from working in the day to working at night is a question of growing importance in industry where automation calls for round-the-clock working of machines. It normally takes from five days to one week for a person to adapt to a reversed  routine of sleep and wakefulness, sleeping during the day and working at night. Unfortunately, it is often the case in industry that shifts  are changed every week; a person may work from 12 midnight to 8 a.m. one week, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. the next, and 4 p.m. to 12 midnight the third and so on. This means that no sooner has he got used to one routine than he has to change to another, so that much of his time is spent neither working nor sleeping very efficiently. The only real solution appears to be to hand over the night shift to a number of permanent night workers. An interesting study of the domestic life and health of night-shift workers was carried out by Brown in 1957. She found a high incidence   of disturbed sleep and other disorders among those on alternating day and night shifts, but no abnormal occurrence of these phenomena among those on permanent night work. This latter system then appears to be the best long-term policy, but meanwhile something may be done to relieve the pressure of alternate day and night work by selecting those people who can adapt most quickly to the changes of routine. One way of knowing when a person has adapted is by measuring his body temperature.

Joseph Krauzenberg is a very wealthy Hungarian Jewish industrial tycoon whose fortune is mirrored in the great palaces he owns. However, by 1944 his important businesses are needed by the Nazis and Hitler's 'Final Solution' is sweeping through Europe. The Nazis are greedy to accumulate wealth as easily as possible, and under the terms of the Third Reich's \\"Europa Plan\\", Krauzenberg arranges with Nazi leaders to exchange his fortune, his business holdings (textile plants, steel mills, ownership of several banks) and a collection of rare art for safe passage to Switzerland for himself, his wife Rachel, and their family.

Edmund Sharpe was born on 31 October 1809 at Brook Cottage, Brook Street in Knutsford, Cheshire, the first child of Francis and Martha Sharpe.  His father, a peripatetic music teacher and organist at Knutsford parish church, came from Stamford in Lincolnshire.  At the time of marriage his wife, Martha Whittaker, was on the staff of an academy for young ladies, Belvedere House, in Bath, Somerset. During his childhood in Knutsford, the young Edmund played with Elizabeth Stevenson, the future Mrs Gaskell. In 1812 the Sharpe family moved across town from Over Knutsford to a farm in Nether Knutsford called Heathside, when Francis Sharpe then worked as both farmer and music teacher.  Edmund was initially educated by his parents, but by 1818 he was attending a school in Knutsford.  Two years later he was a boarder at a school near Runcorn, and in 1821 at Burney's Academy in Greenwich. Edmund's father died suddenly in November 1823, aged 48, and his mother moved to Lancaster with her family, where she later resumed her teaching career.Edmund continued his education at Burney's Academy, and became head boy. In August 1827 he moved to Sedbergh School (then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, now in Cumbria), where he remained for two years. In November 1829 he entered St John's College, Cambridge as a Lupton scholar. At the end of his course in 1832 he was awarded a Worts Travelling Bachelorship by the University of Cambridge, which enabled him to travel abroad for three years' study.  At this time his friend from Lancaster at Trinity College, William Whewell, was Professor of Mineralogy. John Hughes, Edmund Sharpe's biographer, is of the opinion that Whewell was influential in gaining this award for Sharpe. Edmund graduated BA in 1833, and was admitted to the degree of MA in 1836.

Logan always made the point to celebrate Mark's achievements, no matter how small, which boosted Mark's self-confidence and provided the fuel needed to continue on his journey. As Mark became more accustomed to his new, healthier lifestyle, the positive effects became visibly apparent. His weight gradually decreased, his body became more toned and muscular, and his stamina and endurance improved. He could participate in physical activities he once deemed impossible, and he felt happier, more optimistic, and rejuvenated. One year after Mark's life-changing decision, he participated in a charity marathon organized by the town. His newfound love for fitness motivated him to challenge himself and give back to the community. The marathon was a success, and Mark ran alongside many fitness enthusiasts, including Logan and Robert. At the end of the race, a small ceremony was held to honor the participants and celebrate their achievements. When Mark was asked to share a few words, he thanked Logan for his unwavering support and guidance. He credited Logan for helping him transform his life and become a healthier, happier person. Robert, who was present during the ceremony, couldn't help but feel a little disheartened over not being acknowledged for his efforts as a fitness trainer. Mark's words, however, were not meant to undermine Robert's contributions to the community but rather to highlight the profound impact Logan had on Mark's life. In the end, Logan's empathetic approach to fitness and his genuine care for Mark's well-being played a crucial role in Mark's transformation. It wasn't just the physical workouts and dietary advice that made a difference, but the unwavering belief, encouragement, and support Logan provided that ultimately helped Mark become the healthier man he was today."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

HILL’S BROTHER A DEADBEAT Hillary Rodham Clinton’s youngest sibling is a deadbeat dad who owes tens of thousands of dollars in child support to his politically connected ex, The Post has learned. In a disclosure that could prove embarrassing for his sister, Anthony Rodham has stiffed his former wife, Nicole Boxer, out of 75,000 in child support, as well as 55,000 in alimony, a source close to the case said. Including interest and various fees and expenses, the presidential candidate’s brother now owes Boxer – the daughter of Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) – more than 158,000, the source said. The revelation that Rodham is delinquent with his payments won’t be a welcome development for Hillary Clinton, coming as the too-close-to-call battle for the Democratic presidential nomination reaches a fevered pitch and with the first votes to be cast in Iowa in exactly two weeks. Barbara Boxer has not endorsed a candidate in the race. Nicole Boxer received judgments from a Washington judge ordering Rodham to pay up earlier this year, but the cash-strapped business consultant has yet to fork over the hefty sums. “He has consistently been a deadbeat dad when it comes to paying child support and spousal support, despite the courts telling him over and over again that he must meet his obligations,” a source close to Nicole Boxer said. Rodham’s lawyer, Gwendolyn Jo Carlberg, said she would “not comment on the veracity of any figures that are the subject of private and confidential settlement negotiations, as this is a personal, family matter and is under seal.” She did say her client “fully intends to honor the judgment.” Nicole Boxer’s lawyer could not be reached for comment. Rodham, 53, married Boxer in the White House Rose Garden in 1994, when his brother-in-law, Bill Clinton, was president. The couple had a son, Zachary, two years later, but the political union came to an end in 2000. Fights over child support soon followed – at one point in 2002, Nicole charged that her ex hadn’t paid anything in six months. The latest support strife has been going on most of this past year, and Carlberg said her client has been trying to settle their differences in and out of court. She said a Superior Court judge ruled against Rodham earlier this year. “He strongly disagreed with the ruling, and so did I,” she said. “We appealed the decision, and Mr. Rodham did not prevail.” That final ruling was in October. Carlberg said she “sent a settlement letter to Ms. Boxer’s attorney a few weeks ago for structured payment. As of today, we have not received a reply.” The Nicole Boxer source blasted Rodham’s settlement offers as “just another dodge from meeting his obligations to his former wife and son while he lives in his fancy Washington town house” with his new wife, whom he married in 2005. A former insurance salesman, prison guard and private eye, Rodham has been a headache for the former and possibly future first family before. He and his brother Hugh embarrassed the Clintons in 1999 with a politically perilous plan to import hazelnuts from the former Soviet republic of Georgia. He also became a figure in the “Pardongate” scandal, when it was revealed that he lobbied Bill Clinton to pardon two embezzlers. Rodham made headlines again shortly after his split from Nicole, when he was attacked at his family cottage in the Berkshires by a man who claimed he saw Rodham having sex with his girlfriend. Rodham later testified that he “might have” smoked pot with the woman.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Arabic weddings (Arabic: zff, frH, or \`rs) have changed greatly in the past 100 years. Original traditional Arabic weddings are supposed to be very similar to modern-day Bedouin weddings and rural weddings, and they are in some cases unique from one region to another, even within the same country. it must be mentioned that what some people today call \\"Bedouin\\" wedding is in fact the original true traditional Arab Islamic wedding without foreign influence. The marriage process usually starts with meetings between the couple's families, and ends with the wedding's consummation (leilat al-dokhla). Context: Arranged marriages still happen in the Arab world. The traditions of conservative Arab society and Islam forbid couples to have sex or socialize before marriage (however forced marriages are against Islamic teachings). Therefore, when it is time for a young man to get married, his family will look around to identify a number of potential brides.  Arranged marriage is a tradition of Arab nations of West Asia and North Africa, but with the difference that between 17% to majority of all marriages in these countries are also consanguineous marriages. In Saudi Arabia, majority (65%+) of all marriages are endogamous and consanguineous arranged marriages. More than 40% of all marriages are endogamous and consanguineous in Iraq, Jordan, Syria, Yemen, Kuwait, UAE, Oman, Sudan, Libya and Mauritania; and over 1 in 5 marriages in Egypt and Algeria. Among these Arab people, arranged marriages include endogamous and non-consanguineous marriages, and therefore exceed the above observed rates of endogamous and consanguineous marriages. Arab Christians such as Coptic Christians in Egypt. Marriage was a central feature of traditional Aboriginal societies. Freedom of marriage was restricted to ensure children were produced according to the correct family groups and affiliations and avoid marriages with certain close relatives or marriages with any one outside the group. Nevertheless, opinions vary on whether the phenomenon should be seen as exclusively based on Islamic practices as a 1992 study among Arabs in Jordan did not show significant differences between Christian Arabs or Muslim Arabs when comparing the occurrence of consanguinity.  Traditionally, the process of investigation takes into consideration the girls' physical beauty, her behavior, her cleanliness, her education and finally her qualities as a housewife. In carrying out this traditional investigation parents also take the behaviour of the prospective bride's family into account.  The first meeting usually takes place between the bride, groom, and their respective mothers. They meet, usually in a public place or in the bride's house, and get to know each other. The bride, groom, and their chaperones will typically sit separately, but within sight of each other, in order to get to know each other. Nowadays, the man might suggest to his family who he would like them to consider, and it may be that the man and the woman already know each other. It is also nowadays common in urban families for a bride and the groom to agree to marry before the groom approaches the bride's family for their permission. Question: Are arranged marriages still common in the Arab world? Answer:","output":"Yes, arranged marriages are still common in the Arab world. In these marriages, the families of the bride and groom play a big role in choosing their life partners. Although some things have changed, like the bride and groom getting to know each other before marriage, arranged marriages continue to be an important tradition in many Arab countries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Start a list of features from various sports that you want your sport to include. You might take the layout of a baseball field, the play features of bocce ball, and the penalties of football. Don’t take more than one or two features from each sport unless you want to create something that’s a variation of a sport that already exists. Write out how the game is played and how a winner is determined. Be as specific as possible about what each player or team must do and what they are not allowed to do. Decide if there is a time limit or if play goes on until a certain score or goal is reached.  Decide if teams rotate turns or if play shifts back and forth between them at random. For example, in volleyball, each team serves at specific times, but play passes back and forth until one team misses the ball. In baseball, teams take turns being at bat and in the field. Many sports, like soccer, have a time limit and the winner is whoever has the most points. Others, like tennis, are played until a specific point value is reached. If you want the sport to require teams, decide if there must be a set number or if it can vary. On the other side, plan the sport differently if you want it to be a one-on-one game. Keep in mind that some of the most popular sports are adaptable for a range of players.  Sports like soccer, basketball, ultimate frisbee, and football are designed to accommodate a range of player numbers. They typically require at least two people per team and up to ten or eleven, but the game can be played with any number in between. Games like ping pong, tennis, and racquetball require at least two and no more than four, in most cases. Set out what you think is the ideal number of players, but make note of how the game could be adapted for different numbers of players. Start broad, and expand outward into specifics. Make sure there are enough rules to make the sport work but not so many that it becomes confusing for players to learn it. For starters, set out five to ten basic rules.  You might brainstorm lots of rules and then rank them in terms of importance. Go through a process of elimination to get rid of ones that are not necessary. Rules include what players must do, what they are allowed to do, and what they are not allowed to do. For example, players must walk, are allowed to jump, but can’t run. Incorporate various rules from sports that already exist, which you researched in the first stage of the sport’s development.","output":"This article guides the reader through the process of creating a new sport by researching existing ones, combining their features, developing rules, determining player numbers, and ensuring adaptability for various player counts."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The violent response of Patricia to Lindsey's news indicated that Lindsey had said something she didn't like. This reaction from Patricia was unexpected and shocking to everyone in the room, as she was generally known to be level-headed and understanding. Patricia's emotions were heightened, as her clenched fists, furrowed brow, and reddened face signaled her frustration and anger towards Lindsey's revelation. Lindsey, on the other hand, was taken aback by Patricia's response, as she had not anticipated such a strong reaction. This immediately created a tense atmosphere, and everyone in the room felt the weight of the situation. The news that Lindsey had shared seemed to have triggered a deep-rooted issue or feeling that Patricia had been harboring, and now was forced to face head-on. Realizing the effect her words had on her dear friend, Lindsey quickly tried to explain herself and ease the tension. She stuttered and stammered, trying to find the right words to convey her perspective and to ensure that Patricia knew that her intentions were never malicious. As Lindsey’s voice quivered, it was evident that the last thing she wanted was to hurt Patricia or instigate such a hostile exchange. As all eyes remained on the two friends at the center of the conflict, it became vital for them to find a way to resolve their differences and understand each other's viewpoints. The intensity of Patricia's response had left everyone on edge, with some individuals in the room even contemplating whether they should intervene in order to prevent further escalation. Though it was clear that Lindsey had said something Patricia didn't like, uncovering the root of this emotional response would require both parties to engage in open and honest communication. It would be necessary for Patricia to express her feelings and explain the reason behind her reaction, while Lindsey should listen attentively and provide her own perspective on the matter. The situation was undeniably uncomfortable and difficult for everyone involved. Still, it was essential to find a way forward, as these two friends had a strong bond that deserved the chance to be mended. Through candid discussions and a mutual willingness to understand and empathize, it seemed possible that Patricia and Lindsey would be able to put this unfortunate incident behind them and emerge with an even deeper connection and sense of trust."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the second step, the iron(II) ions are further oxidized and combine with water and oxygen gas to produce a hydrated form of iron(III) oxide known as rust. Rusting is one of many example of corrosion. Corrosion is the deterioration of metals by redox processes. Corrosion causes enormous amounts of damage to buildings, bridges, ships, cars, and other objects. It has been estimated that corrosion costs the U.S. economy over 100 billion dollars each year. A great amount of time and effort is spent to try to limit or prevent corrosion.  and the situation: Jordan is conducting an experiment to see how Iron rusts. He first takes Iron Bar A and puts it out on his porch on a rainy day. Then he puts Iron bar B in an airtight bag and removes all of the oxygen and air to vacuum seal it. After some time passes the bar he left outside is completely covered in rust. He removes the bar in the vacuum sealed bag and to his surprise it has no rust at all. Because there was no oxygen and water in the air tight bag, iron bar B has no rust at all. Iron bar A was exposed to a lot of water and oxygen and there for it rusted completely.

While flying a routine mission for the U.S. Navy from his aircraft carrier, an emergency causes Lieutenant Robin \\"Rob\\" Crusoe to eject from his F-8 Crusader into the ocean. Crusoe drifts on the ocean in an emergency life raft for several days and nights until landing on an uninhabited island. Crusoe builds a shelter for himself, fashions new clothing out of available materials, and begins to scout the island, discovering an abandoned Japanese submarine from World War II. Scouring the submarine, Crusoe also discovers a NASA astrochimp named Floyd, played by Dinky.Using tools and blueprints found in the submarine, Crusoe and Floyd construct a Japanese pavilion, a golf course, and a mail delivery system for sending bottles containing missives to his fiancee out to sea. Soon after, Crusoe finds that the island is not entirely uninhabited when he encounters a beautiful island girl, whom he names Wednesday. Wednesday recounts that due to her unwillingness to marry, her chieftain father, Tanamashuhi, plans to sacrifice her and her sisters to Kaboona, an immense effigy on the island with whom he pretends to communicate. The day Tanamashu arrives on the island, Crusoe uses paraphernalia from the submarine to combat him, culminating in the destruction of the Kaboona statue.

A stronger acid produces a greater concentration of ions than a weaker acid.  If an acid is strong, it's concentration of ions will be increased or decreased.? A:","output":"If an acid is strong, its concentration of ions will be increased. Justification: 1. When an acid dissolves in water, it donates protons (H+ ions) to the water molecules, producing hydronium ions (H3O+). This process is called ionization or dissociation.  2. Strong acids are completely or very nearly completely ionized in water. This means that each molecule of a strong acid becomes a hydronium ion (and an anion). Therefore, the concentration of ions in the solution is directly proportional to the concentration of the strong acid. 3. For example, if 1 mole of hydrochloric acid (HCl, a strong acid) is dissolved in water, it will produce 1 mole of hydronium ions (H3O+) and 1 mole of chloride ions (Cl-) giving a total of 2 moles of ions. 4. On the other hand, weak acids only partially ionize, meaning fewer ions are produced. Therefore, the concentration of ions in a solution of strong acid is higher compared to a weaker one.

Bradford Myatt knew that his father, Earl, had been distraught over the deteriorating health of his wife, but nothing could have prepared him for what happened Sunday.      At approximately 1:37 p.m., Earl and Mary Myatt were struck and killed by a CSX freight train heading east at the crossover at Fox Road.      A suicide note was found in the Oneida couple’s car that was parked alongside the tracks, and Earl called Bradford a couple of minutes prior to the incident to say “he was sorry for what he was about to do.”      “He called me at 1:35, and at 1:37, they were dead,” said Bradford, 30. “We’re devastated … but I want everyone to know that my father was a good man, and my mother was an angel who would do anything for anybody.”      Myatt said his mother, Mary, 59, was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm Jan. 20 and that her cognitive functions were like that of a toddler. He said his 59-year-old father was having a hard time dealing with it.      “He was saddened by what she had been reduced to,” Bradford said. “He missed his wife.”      Trooper Jack Keller, public information officer for State Police Troop D, said investigators still were conducting follow-up interviews Monday and putting together the accident reconstruction, which will indicate the speed the train was traveling and whether it tried to stop before hitting the couple, who had been married 42 years.      “It appears they just picked a random location,” Keller said of the spot the Myatts were killed. “We have witnesses who said they heard a warning horn … but there is video that shows they stood right on the tracks waiting for it to come.”      Earl and Mary Wyatt also left behind a 42-year-old son, Brian, and four grandchildren.

His parents were married for 42 years.      Their marriage and lives ended Sunday when they stood in the path of a CSX train in the Oneida County town of Verona. They were both 59.      Earl and Mary Myatt, of Oneida, were hardworking parents who doted on their children and then their grandchildren. He loved to golf. She loved to fish and make sandcastles at Verona Beach.      But their story is one where the complications of age and illness came early: Mary Myatt had a brain aneurysm in January, her son said.      She spent a month in intensive care at Upstate University Hospital, Brad Myatt said. Mary Myatt had multiple surgeries on her skull. The last was two weeks ago, her son said.      Mary Myatt wasn't the person she had been before the aneurysm. She would start a conversation and get lost. She didn't always understand what was happening around her. She struggled to use the bathroom on her own.      She was frustrated, her son said.      Mary Myatt was Earl Myatt's life. And her frustration was his, too, said their son.      Brad Myatt said his father was devastated by his mother's illness and had become depressed.      But he didn't sway from her side.      The Myatts were working people. Both had jobs at Mohawk Valley Community College at the bookstore; Earl worked in Utica and Mary worked at the Rome campus.      Earl Myatt would go to work at 3:30 a.m. when his wife was in the hospital in Syracuse so he could spend the rest of his day with her. And when she was moved to the Oneida Healthcare Extended Care Facility at the end of February, he would still go to work before dawn so he could spend the end of each day with his wife.      Poll: Should New York revisit legalizing euthanasia?      The couple's four grandkids weren't allowed at the Oneida facility, so Earl Myatt took Mary to visit them every Saturday and Sunday. First they would go to their older son Brian's house to see his son and daughter. Then they would go to Brad's house to see his two girls.      Before her illness, Mary Myatt was the kind of grandma every kid wants. She'd beg to babysit. She'd have a tea party. She'd paint. She'd play in the snow. And she'd be happy because the kids were.      \\"It was never about her,\\" Brad Myatt said. It was about the kids. And when he and his brother, Brian, were growing up, Mary Myatt's life - and Earl's too -- was about them.      Mary and Earl would drive six hours to see one of the boys golf or play basketball for a fraction of that time. They were the parents that didn't miss a game.      \\"We were spoiled in receiving two fantastic parents,\\" Brad Myatt said. He was the last person to talk to his parents.      Earl Myatt called Brad Sunday afternoon.      He put Mary Myatt on the phone. \\"I said, 'I'll see you soon,'\\" Brad recalled. He couldn't understand his mother's response, which wasn't uncommon. Then Earl Myatt got on the phone.      \\"He just said he loved me and he was sorry,\\" Brad Myatt said. He knew something was wrong. He begged his father to tell him where he was, but Earl Myatt hung up.      What Brad Myatt wants people to know, more than anything, was that his father was a good man who worked hard and asked for nothing in return. And Mary Myatt was Earl Myatt's everything. Earl Myatt wasn't acting rationally, his son said, but he was acting out of love for the woman who had been by his side for four decades.      \\"She was his world,\\" Brad Myatt said.      On Sunday, when Earl Myatt took his wife of 42 years to the train tracks, he wasn't himself, Brad Myatt said. He was a man who thought he was losing his everything.      Brad Myatt has called to tell the train's driver how sorry he is for what happened.      No one knows what Mary Myatt wanted. She could still lift her saucer at her grandkids' tea parties. But she needed help for even the simplest tasks of daily life.      Her life, her son said, was about everyone else's joy. It was never about her.      Earl and Mary Myatt, who fell in love at 17, left life the way they lived it: Together.

The match was between the American player John Isner and the French player Nicolas Mahut. It took place from 22nd to 24th June 2010 at one of the outside courts of Wimbledon, specifically Court 18. The match is often referred to as the \\"endless match\\" due to its extraordinary length. Wimbledon is one of the four annual Grand Slam tennis tournaments, and it is well known for its traditional and prestigious status in the world of tennis. The tournament is always played on outdoor grass courts, yielding a faster game compared to other surface types. Much of the Wimbledon tournament's legacy lies in its adherence to tradition, including the all-white dress code for players, and the fact that it continues to be the only Grand Slam tournament still played on grass. In terms of the match itself, it was a first-round Men's Singles match and it broke multiple records. Here are some of the significant facts about that game: 1. Total duration of the match: The match lasted for 11 hours and 5 minutes, which far exceeds the previous record for the longest match, which was a 2004 French Open match that extended to 6 hours and 33 minutes. 2. Final Set: The final set alone (the fifth set) lasted 8 hours and 11 minutes. Isner won the set 70-68. Unlike tennis matches at other Grand Slam tournaments, there is no tiebreak in the final set at Wimbledon. A player must win by two games, leading to potentially endless matches. 3. Number of games: The Isner-Mahut match consisted of a total of 183 games, shattering the previous record of a 112-game match in 1969. 4. Number of aces: Both players broke individual records for the most aces served in a match, with Isner hitting 113 and Mahut 103. This epic match ended with John Isner winning and moving to the second round. However, the achievement of both players in this historically lengthy match was recognized, and a plaque commemorating the match was placed at Court 18 of the Wimbledon Club.

Summarize this article: STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- NASA says there is a small chance an asteroid the size of the Empire State Building could hit Earth in 2135.      NASA scientists say the asteroid, named Bennu, could slam into Earth in September 2135, destroying living things in the process.      While the odds of the asteroid hitting Earth are one in 2,700, NASA has a plan if Bennu decides to go rogue.      In an integrated study by NASA and the National Nuclear Security Administration, researchers have two realistic responses if Bennu comes too close to Earth. Bennu was selected for the case study because it is the best-studied of the known near-Earth objects.      According to the study, NASA would use a spacecraft functioning as a kinetic impactor to deflect or push the asteroid out of Earth's orbit. In certain cases, NASA would set off a nuclear weapon.      The plan is called the Hypervelocity Asteroid Mitigation Mission for Emergency Response, or HAMMER.      NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft has been on its way to Bennu for two years, according to the space agency. It is the first U.S. mission to collect a sample of an asteroid and return it to Earth to study.      \\"Analyzing the sample will help scientists understand the early solar system, as well as the hazards and resources of near-Earth space,\\" NASA wrote on its website.      The sample will allow scientists to study the asteroid which contain natural resources such as water, organics and metal.      \\"Asteroids are remnants of the building blocks that formed the planets and enabled life. Future space exploration and economic development may rely on asteroids for these materials,\\" NASA wrote.      FOLLOW ANNALISE KNUDSON ON FACEBOOK AND TWITTER. ||||| This paper is part of an integrated study by NASA and the NNSA to quantitatively understand the response timeframe should a threatening Earth-impacting near-Earth object (NEO) be identified. The two realistic responses considered are the use of a spacecraft functioning as either a kinetic impactor or a nuclear explosive carrier to deflect the approaching NEO. The choice depends on the NEO size and mass, the available response time prior to Earth impact, and the various uncertainties. Whenever practical, the kinetic impactor is the preferred approach, but various factors, such as large uncertainties or short available response time, reduce the kinetic impactor's suitability and, ultimately, eliminate its sufficiency.      Herein we examine response time and the activities that occur between the time when an NEO is recognized as being a sufficient threat to require a deflection and the time when the deflection impulse is applied to the NEO. To use a kinetic impactor for successful deflection of an NEO, it is essential to minimize the reaction time and maximize the time available for the impulse delivered to the NEO by the kinetic impactor to integrate forward in time to the eventual deflection of the NEO away from Earth impact. ||||| Here’s a tip for the planners among us: If you have dinner reservations or theater tickets for Sept. 22, 2135 (it’s a Thursday), now might be a good time to scuttle them.      Sometime the day before, scientists say, there is a small chance that an asteroid the size of the Empire State Building will smack into Earth, destroying a lot of living things on the planet.      But don’t worry. NASA has got you covered.      Forward-thinking astrophysicists and people who specialize in blowing things up with nuclear weapons have come up with a plan, which they swear was not drawn up by Bruce Willis.      If the asteroid — it is named Bennu — decides to go rogue, they could send a nearly nine-ton “bulk impactor” to push it out of Earth’s orbit. Or, more likely, they would gently nudge it out of its apocalyptic path using a nuclear device.      The scheme is called the Hypervelocity Asteroid Mitigation Mission for Emergency Response. Or, for people who love acronyms and despise subtlety: HAMMER.      Brent W. Barbee, the NASA aerospace engineer who helped author the study, insists that it is all theoretical. (His exact words: “Please don’t print that an asteroid is going to crash into Earth in The Washington Post.”)      But using granular detail and eye-glazing amounts of math, the researchers believe they have a viable solution to a world-rattling what-if question.      There is, of course, no massive mission to build a craft capable of playing a celestial game of space pool. The odds of Bennu actually hitting us are about 1 in 2,700. And the asteroid is not big enough to send us the way of the dinosaurs.      But that doesn’t mean there is no practical application, Barbee told The Post.      “We’re doing these design studies to prepare ourselves, so if we do find a threatening object, we’re better prepared to deal with it,” he said.      Things from space smack into Earth all the time. Most of them are not existential threats, but some are large enough to cause injury or property damage. Generating a working framework to avoid an Earth impact could save lives.      Until recently, the framework has basically been luck.      In 1908, what many believe to be an asteroid crashed into an area near the Podkamennaya Tunguska River in Siberia, according to the BBC. It struck with a force 185 times as powerful as the Hiroshima atomic bomb, flattened 80 million trees and reduced hundreds of reindeer to charred carcasses.      A century later in 2013, a 10-ton, 49-foot-wide meteor streaked over Russia’s Ural Mountains at hypersonic speeds, shattering windows and injuring 1,100 people, Fox News reported. (Most were injured by shattered glass as they watched the meteor cross the daytime sky). The meteor broke up before it hit the ground but still left scars in nearby ice that were the length of a bus.      The only reason more people weren’t killed or injured, Barbee told The Post, is because the objects struck places where there weren’t many people.      [With a spacecraft in trouble and the White House watching, SpaceX had to deliver]      NASA has a Planetary Defense Coordination Office that tries to detect dangerous asteroids and comets close to Earth’s orbit.      There are more of these things than many people think, Barbee said. Researchers detect about 1,000 new objects each year; 10,000 extraterrestrial objects beelining for Earth could still be unaccounted for.      The defense coordination office also comes up with plans for deflecting or destroying discovered objects.      What Asteroid Bennu provides, besides pretty good fodder for a doomsday cult, is an opportunity for scientists to test those theories.      Bennu is, the report says, a “well-studied roughly spherical body” that gives researchers a good target for their calculations — data points to punch into the algorithm. They can see Bennu with telescopes and track the impact its gravity has on other celestial objects.      Soon we will know more. NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft has been en route to Bennu for two years, according to the agency. It contains instruments that “will map Bennu and establish the composition of the asteroid, including the distribution of the elements, minerals and organic materials.”      It will also scrape off a 2.1-ounce sample and bring it back to Earth, NASA says.      If the odds are not in Earth’s favor, and Bennu becomes a bigger threat, OSIRIS-REx could be followed by a beefier craft that would break off a lot more.

There’s a team of Russian scientists zapping mini asteroids in their lab, and supposedly NASA is thinking about a plan that would hypothetically involve nuking Bennu should it threaten Earth in 2135.            It’s true that NASA is drafting up ideas on how one might nuke an incoming asteroid, a theoretical plan called HAMMER, or the Hypervelocity Asteroid Mitigation Mission for Emergency Response, as we’ve reported. But scientists probably won’t need to use such a response on the “Empire State Building-sized” asteroid 101955 Bennu, which is set to pass close to Earth in 2135. Diverting such a threat could be much, much easier.      Advertisement      “Even just painting the surface a different color on one half would change the thermal properties and change its orbit,” Michael Moreau, NASA’s OSIRIS-REx Flight Dynamics System Manager, told Gizmodo. That would involve literally sending a spacecraft to somehow change the color of some of the asteroid.      There’s lots we don’t know about asteroids just yet, which is why NASA has sent the probe OSIRIS-REx toward Bennu. This mission aims to scoop up and return a sample of the rock in 2023.      There is a minuscule chance, around 1 in 2,700 odds, that Bennu will strike Earth in 2135, reports the Washington Post. The rock isn’t big enough to end humanity, but it could cause some major damage. The OSIRIS-REx spacecraft will study the rock more, and NASA will continue to collect data to either rule out the chance of an impact or increase the odds.      Advertisement      But don’t worry about Bennu yet. Should the odds of a Bennu strike grow too high, the laws of physics will allow for a much easier solution than nuking. We could just splash it with some paint.      The sun pelts everything in the solar system with a slew of tiny particles, for example. This imparts a little bit of pressure. These particles are of no consequence to our own orbit, since Earth is incredibly massive, but Bennu weighs only around 13 times the mass of the Great Pyramid of Giza. That’s very light, comparatively. Given the 120 years or so we’ve got and the amount of distance Bennu has left to travel before its nearby approach, if scientists could make some of it more susceptible to the solar radiation, that would slightly alter its path enough that it would miss us. Doing so would require changing part of its surface so it absorbs more radiation—for example, by covering one side of it with paint. Scientists first need to better study its orbit around the sun to determine the best course of action.      All that is to say, as usual, we’re not about to be hit by the giant asteroid in the headlines.      Advertisement      There are asteroids we need to worry about, of course. But as we’ve reported before, we’re not tracking them. The government has only required that NASA track asteroids larger than a football field or so. Something smaller could go under the radar and cause significant local damage without the 120 years of warning Bennu has afforded us.      The thought of nuking asteroids makes for great science fiction. But instead, you should spend more time upset that we don’t know what smaller asteroids are threatening us, rather than worry about the ones scientists are tracking that could be diverted more easily. ||||| Summary:","output":"NASA says there is a small chance that an asteroid named Bennu, the size of the Empire State Building, could hit Earth in 2135.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of Smetana's first large-scale piece that is independent of words? ?  Dissatisfied with his first large-scale orchestral work, the D major Overture of 1848, Smetana studied passages from Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Weber and Berlioz before producing his Triumphal Symphony of 1853. Though this is dismissed by Rosa Newmarch as \\"an epithalamium for a Habsburg Prince\\", Smetana's biographer Brian Large identifies much in the piece that characterises the composer's more mature works. Despite the symphony's rejection by the Court and the lukewarm reception on its premiere, Smetana did not abandon the work. It was well received in Gothenburg in 1860, and a revised version was performed in Prague in 1882, without the \\"triumphal\\" tag, under Adolf Čech. The piece is now sometimes called the Festive Symphony. Smetana's visit to Liszt at Weimar in the summer of 1857, where he heard the latter's Faust Symphony and Die Ideale, caused a material reorientation of Smetana's orchestral music. These works gave Smetana answers to many compositional problems relating to the structure of orchestral music, and suggested a means for expressing literary subjects by a synthesis between music and text, rather than by simple musical illustration. These insights enabled Smetana to write the three Gothenburg symphonic poems, (Richard III, Wallenstein's Camp and Hakon Jarl), works that transformed Smetana from a composer primarily of salon pieces to a modern neo-Romantic, capable of handling large-scale forces and demonstrating the latest musical concepts. From 1862 Smetana was largely occupied with opera and, apart from a few short pieces, did not return to purely orchestral music before beginning Má vlast in 1872. In his introduction to the Collected Edition Score, František Bartol brackets Má vlast with the opera Libuše as \\"direct symbols of [the] consummating national struggle\\". Má vlast is the first of Smetana's mature large-scale works that is independent of words, and its musical ideas are bolder than anything he had tried before.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Dark Knight Rises Shooting in Aurora Puts the Colorado town on the map in a bad way Aurora has always been a town with a chip on its shoulder  something I say with love because it's my hometown. It's the biggest suburb in Colorado, but the fate of suburbs is to be overshadowed. The professional sports teams have Denver on their jerseys, the airport (though it is closer to Aurora) has Denver in its name. A former mayor once predicted that someday the region would be known as Aurora-Denver. You know, like Minneapolis-St. Paul, or Dallas-Fort Worth. Most people just rolled their eyes. (Read \\"Shooting Rampage at Dark Knight Rises Showing in Colo.; 12 Dead.\\") But today Aurora becomes an internationally known dateline. The shopping mall where I spent my mall rat years is on the world's television screens today, and a rapidly growing contingent of reporters is gathering at my high school a few hundred yards from a horrific murder scene. James Holmes, 24, walked into the midnight showing of the new Batman movie and wounded 71 people in a hail of bullets, at least 12 of them fatally. It's likely that the victims are of all races and shades, because Aurora is a melting pot. Forget that old image of lily-white suburbia, Wally and Eddie and the Beav. That was the Aurora of 1961, perhaps, the year I raised the rapidly growing population by one. We lived in a little cookie-cutter insta-house built by developer Sam Hoffman for the trolley-riding young working dads of a postwar boomtown. But today, Aurora is as diverse a city as you are likely to find: 60% white, according to the 2010 Census, 28% Hispanic, 16% black, 5% Asian. You notice that doesn't add up to 100. That's the beauty of diversity: more and more people don't fit neatly into a single category. Kids in the Aurora Public Schools come from 125 countries and speak more than 100 languages, according to the district website. The constant in that half-century of change is that Aurora has always been a working-class town, a place where communities aren't gated and most golf courses are open to the public. The average resident is a little younger than the Colorado average and the average household income is a little lower. It's a good place to start out. And a good place to find those middle-class working family folks that politicians are always talking about, though rarely actually talking to. Aurora is a swing city in a swing state, a place that voted for George W. Bush and for Barack Obama. When I was a kid the neighborhood Democrats held their precinct caucus at a house across the street from the neighborhood Republicans, and a significant proportion of both groups joked that they would prefer to caucus in lawn chairs halfway between the two. So you can bet that the president and his rival Mitt Romney will both take Aurora's present pain very seriously in very photogenic ways. Demography is different, however, from identity. Aurora's identity has long been its lack of one. As Gertrude Stein said of her hometown of Oakland, there is no there there. Aurora sprawls over a greater land mass than its famous neighbor, Denver, yet has no core. The original city center is now blighted, like so many inner-ring American suburbs, and development over the past half century has spread like water spilled on the floor. The current City Hall is across the street from the mall where the shooting occurred, but most people would get in their cars to make the trip. It's a low-slung place on the Western edge of the arid high plains; neither the trees nor the buildings get very tall. Cheaper to build sideways than up, because there is so much empty sideways available. The glamorous part of Colorado, the spectacular Rocky Mountains with their pricey ski resorts and private jet terminals, is a distant vision on the horizon. Perhaps it is fitting that the leading employer in this often ignored place is an industry that only whispers its name. Aurora's central location, high elevation, and clear prairie air long ago moved the Pentagon to locate classified and high-tech radar arrays on the edge of town. As a boy I would look from my bedroom window at the mysterious giant golf ball shapes and picture the Soviet missiles homing in on them. Aurora was certainly on the Kremlin's map during the Cold War. Since 9/11, that function has been expanded, and now the Buckley Air Force Base employs more than 12,000 people to monitor spy satellites and Predator drones and who knows what all secret business. Defense contractors like Raytheon and Northrup-Grumman employ thousands more. It's a shame that those extraordinary devices, which can see a man walking in the Yemeni desert or spy a campsite beside the Khyber Pass can't discern a deranged individual and his growing arsenal in time to prevent a massacre down the street. There would be more people alive in Aurora today, and fewer grieving families. And the overlooked city would still be largely unknown, which, we now see, is not so bad after all.

Hypothesis: Black was looking at me.  Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"To investigate whether the premise entails the hypothesis, it is crucial to understand the meaning of \\"entailment\\" and analyze the given statements (premise and hypothesis) to determine their logical relationship. Entailment, in logic, is a relation between statements, where the truth of one statement necessarily implies the truth of another. In other words, if a premise entails a hypothesis, then every time the premise is true, the hypothesis must also be true. It means that it would be impossible to have a true premise and a false hypothesis at the same time. Now let's analyze the given statements: Premise: White looked at me.  This statement claims that a person (or entity), \\"White,\\" is looking at the speaker (me).  Hypothesis: Black was looking at me.  This statement presents a different person (or entity), \\"Black,\\" who is supposedly looking at the speaker (me). To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, we must evaluate whether the truth of the premise necessarily guarantees the truth of the hypothesis. In this case, the premise and hypothesis refer to two different entities (White and Black) and their independent actions (looking at the speaker). The truth of the premise, \\"White looked at me,\\" provides no information regarding the actions of Black, making it possible for Black to either be looking at the speaker or not. Since we can imagine a situation where the premise is true (White looked at me) and the hypothesis is false (Black wasn't looking at me), we can conclude that the premise does not entail the hypothesis. These two statements are independent of each other and do not offer any logically necessary connections between them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write a summary based on this article: The range of the Saudi intervention is extraordinary as the unrest pushes Riyadh’s hand to forge what some commentators, in Egypt and elsewhere, brand a “counterrevolution.” Some Saudi and foreign analysts find the term too sweeping for the steps the Saudis have actually taken, though they appear unparalleled in the region and beyond as the kingdom reaches out to ally with non-Arab Muslim states as well.      “I am sure that the Saudis do not like this revolutionary wave — they were really scared,” said Khalid Dakhil, a Saudi political analyst and columnist. “But they are realistic here.”      In Egypt, where the revolution has already toppled a close Saudi ally in Hosni Mubarak, the Saudis are dispensing aid and mending ties in part to help head off a good showing by the Muslim Brotherhood in the coming parliamentary elections. The Saudis worry that an empowered Muslim Brotherhood could damage Saudi legitimacy by presenting a model of Islamic law different from the Wahhabi tradition of an absolute monarch.      “If another model of Shariah says that you have to resist, this will create a deep difficulty,” said Abdulaziz Algasim, a Saudi lawyer.      Photo      Saudi officials are also concerned that Egypt’s foreign policy is shifting, with its outreach to the Islamist group Hamas and plans to restore ties with Iran. The Saudi monarch, King Abdullah, also retains a personal interest in protecting Mr. Mubarak, analysts believe.      The Arab Spring began to unravel an alliance of so-called moderate Arab states, led by Saudi Arabia and Egypt, which were willing to work closely with the United States and promote peace with Israel. American support for the Arab uprisings also strained relations, prompting Saudi Arabia to split from Washington on some issues while questioning its longstanding reliance on the United States to protect its interests.      The strained Saudi posture toward Washington was outlined in a recent opinion article by Nawaf Obaid, a Saudi analyst, in The Washington Post that suggested Riyadh was ready to go it alone because the United States had become an “unreliable partner.”      Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But that seems at least partly a display of Saudi pique, since the oil-for-military aid arrangement that has defined relations between the two for the past six decades is unlikely to be replaced soon. Saudi Arabia is negotiating to buy 60 billion in advanced American weapons, and President Obama, in his speech last week demanding that Middle Eastern autocrats bow to popular demands for democracy, noticeably did not mention Saudi Arabia. The Saudi ambassador, Adel al-Jubeir, sat prominently in the front row.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Saudi Arabia is taking each uprising in turn, without relying on a single blueprint. In Bahrain, it resorted to force, sending troops to crush a rebellion by Shiites because it feared the creation of a hostile government — a kind of Shiite Cuba — only about 20 miles from some of its main oil fields, one sympathetic to Iran, if not allied with it. It has deployed diplomacy in other uprisings, and remained on the fence in still others. It is also spending money, pledging 20 billion to help stabilize Bahrain and Oman, which has also faced protests.      In Yemen, Saudi Arabia joined the coalition seeking to ease out President Ali Abdullah Saleh because it thinks the opposition might prove a more reliable, less unruly southern neighbor. But Arab diplomats noted that even the smallest Saudi gestures provided Mr. Saleh with excuses to stay, since he interpreted them as support. This month, for example, the Saudis sent in tanker trucks to help abate a gasoline shortage.      On Syria, an initial statement of support by King Abdullah for President Bashar al-Assad has been followed by silence, along with occasional calls at Friday Prayer for God to support the protesters. That silence reflects a deep ambivalence, analysts said. The ruling Saudi family personally dislikes Mr. Assad — resenting his close ties with Iran and seeing Syria’s hand in the assassination of a former Lebanese prime minister, Rafik Hariri, a Saudi ally. But they fear his overthrow will unleash sectarian violence without guaranteeing that Iranian influence will be diminished.      In Libya, after helping push through an Arab League request for international intervention, Saudi Arabia sat out and left its neighbors, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, to join the military coalition supporting the rebels. It has so far kept its distance publicly from Tunisia as well, although it gave refuge to its ousted president, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali.      There are also suspicions that the kingdom is secretly providing money to extremist groups to hold back changes. Saudi officials deny that, although they concede private money may flow.      In 1952, after toppling the Egyptian king, Gamal Abdel Nasser worked to destabilize all monarchs, inspiring a regicide in Iraq and eventually the overthrow of King Idris of Libya. Saudi Arabia was locked in confrontation with Egypt throughout the 1960s, and it is determined not to relive that period.      “We are back to the 1950s and early 1960s, when the Saudis led the opposition to the revolutions at that time, the revolutions of Arabism,” said Mohammad F. al-Qahtani, a political activist in Riyadh. ||||| Dow Jones Reprints: This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only.

Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. As one of the world's leading contemporary recording artists, she is known for narrative songs about her personal life, which have received widespread media coverage. Born and raised in Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville, Tennessee, at the age of 14 to pursue a career in country music. She signed with the label Big Machine Records and became the youngest artist ever signed by the Sony/ATV Music publishing house. Her 2006 self-titled debut album peaked at number five on the Billboard 200 and spent the most weeks on the chart in the 2000s. The album's third single, \\"Our Song\\", made her the youngest person to single-handedly write and perform a number-one song on the Hot Country Songs chart. Swift's second album, Fearless, was released in 2008. Buoyed by the success of pop crossover singles \\"Love Story\\" and \\"You Belong with Me\\", Fearless became the best-selling album of 2009 in the US. The album won four Grammy Awards, with Swift becoming the youngest Album of the Year winner. Swift was the sole writer of her 2010 album, Speak Now. It debuted at number one in the United States and the single \\"Mean\\" won two Grammy Awards. Her fourth album, Red (2012), yielded the successful singles \\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\\" and \\"I Knew You Were Trouble\\". For her fifth album, the pop-focused 1989 (2014), she received three Grammys, and became the first woman and fifth act overall to win Album of the Year twice. Its singles \\"Shake It Off\\", \\"Blank Space\\", and \\"Bad Blood\\" reached number one in the US, Australia, and Canada. Swift's sixth album, Reputation (2017) and its lead single \\"Look What You Made Me Do\\" topped the UK and US charts; with the former, she became the first act to have four albums sell one million copies within one week in the US. Swift is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 50 million albums—including 27.8 million in the US—and 150 million single downloads. As a songwriter, she has...

Build a movie plot around this: who is the leader of a faction of younger vampires? Frost Answer:","output":"Title: \\"Frost: Blood Reign\\" Plot: The movie opens with a scene of the dark, sprawling metropolis of Edgewood, plagued with escalating disputes between older, traditional vampire societies and a faction of defiant younger vampires. These younger vampires reject the old ways, thirsting for not just blood but power, freedom, and influence. Our protagonist, Frost, is the charismatic leader of this faction of young vampires, known as the Nightwalkers. He is known for his striking ice-cold blue eyes and hair as white as frost, hence his name. Frost is a fearless innovator who wishes to free his kind from the oppressive rules of the Sanguinary Council - a conservative governing board composed of ancient vampires who prefer hiding in shadows. Frost's faction all share his progressive views and are less inclined to hide from humans but learn to coexist with them. Frost's ultimate vision involves a world where vampires no longer survive in shadows but as equals to humans, a vision that incites anxiety and defiance among traditional vampires. The movie slowly reveals the backstory of Frost, who once belonged to the Sanguinary Council before witnessing their brutal treatment of Nightwalkers. Shaken by his past, Frost's charisma conceals a deep well of anguish and guilt. His only relief comes from his love interest, a human by the name Emily who's a brilliant and empathetic scientist striving to understand vampire biology in the hopes of peaceful coexistence. Conflict arises as the movie progresses. The Sanguinary Council grows intolerant of the Nightwalkers, fearing their audacious ideas will cause unnecessary attention from the human world, threatening their existence. An enigmatic character belonging to the Sanguinary Council's leader, Vladislav, starts orchestrating plans to eliminate Frost and the Nightwalkers. Meanwhile, Frost and Emily uncover a secret that could change the dynamics of their world – the existence of a genetic mutation that could essentially grant vampires immunity to sun and suppress their thirst for blood. Emily’s research paves the path for a potential harmony; however, this knowledge also places them under threat. As news of the mutation spreads, the Council becomes desperate, using all their resources to chase Emily and Frost, plunging their world into chaos. Frost must protect Emily and unify the Nightwalkers while seeking an alliance with fringe human factions who believe in the possibility of peaceful coexistence.  In a climactic showdown, Frost and Vladislav face off, highlighting the struggle between the new and old, change and stagnation. A thrilling battle sequence reveals not just Frost's courage, but also the strength and unity of the Nightwalkers. Meanwhile, Emily successfully implements the genetic mutation into a willing Nightwalker, proving it works. The movie ends with Frost winning the battle, assuming leadership over all vampire societies. With Emily's discovery, the path to coexistence for humans and vampires begins. ‘Frost: Blood Reign’ is a tale of rebirth and transformation, set in a world of darkness teetering on the cusp of unprecedented change. Fast-paced, packed with action and drama, it explores potent themes of societal progress, acceptance, and the cost of freedom."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 1: Analyze the context and options The context states that Cameron exercised intensely during the day and then had a good night's sleep. We need to determine which option best fits the context. Step 2: Compare available options a). Going for a triathlon is a possibility, but it involves more than just intense exercise (swimming, cycling, and running). This option is more complex and doesn't necessarily indicate a single intense exercise. b). Running a marathon involves intense exercise, satisfies the condition of intense physical activity during the day, and seems like a more specific choice than a triathlon. c). Taking a shower seems unrelated to the context of intense exercise. It's more of an action taken after exercise.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: My son Jack, a fourth grader, was having a hard time in getting interested in story books recently, so I offered to read the first few chapters to him. In the early pages of 'Incident at Halk Hill', a quiet little boy has a special meeting with a female badger  .Soon after, another badger is caught in a steel leg trap , and the author describes in detail the pain and scare of an animal struggling to its death. We meet the cruel hunter and his ill treatment of a dog; we see the badger being skinned by the boy's father;and we experience the child's confusion when beaten by his father in anger. _ , I thought. Last night , I returned from a weekend away to find that Jack had finished the whole book on his own. \\"It was really, really good and sad, and violent,\\" he reported. \\"There was a lot of killing.\\" \\"Were there any happy parts?\\" I asked, \\"The boy's life was saved by the badger, and that was good. But then that badger got caught in a trap again and at the end it's dying, too. \\" Jack said, \\"It was so sad that I almost cried. \\" I told him that many books have made me cry, beginning with Heidi, when I was just his age, right on up to the novel I finished last week. \\"Well,\\" he admitted then, \\"I actually did cry. Reading that book just reminded me of all the sadness in the world, and it made me feel sad ,too. \\" So, I think, now he has been through the sad tone of the passage , the discovery that words on a printed page can give rise to such strong emotion ,that a book can move you right out of your own comfortable little self and into someone else's pain. Thus we come to realize that if we are to remain fully engaged in life, open to its mysteries and feel sorry towards its suffering, we indeed need stories to grab  us by the neck and remind us of the sadness in the world that is not our own.

Take the pad for your polishing wheel and get it wet using clean water.  Wring it out so it remains damp, but not soaking wet.  The pad must stay damp through the polishing process to avoid damaging your car’s paint.  A dry pad will burn the clear coat on your car. Keep a bucket of clean water or a hose nearby throughout the polishing process. Put a moderate amount of polishing compound on the pad, then turn on the polishing wheel and press it into the paint of the vehicle.  You may also apply the compound directly onto the body of the car, then bring the polisher to it.  Read the instructions on the specific polishing compound you purchased, as some may have specific steps you’ll need to take for the best result. Once you finish one body panel, then move on to the next one. It is extremely important that you keep the polishing wheel parallel to whatever body panel you are currently polishing.  Maintain an even amount of pressure over the wheel as you move it back and forth along the panel you are working on.  Applying steady, constant pressure will reduce chances of damaging your paint. The polishing wheel will be spinning, so you need only move it back and forth. As you polish the paint on the vehicle, the polishing compound will swirl and smear, then slowly disappear, leaving only the brilliant shine of the paint behind.  Once you can see the shiny paint, you can move on to the next area and continue polishing.  Unlike waxing the vehicle, you do no not need to wait for the polish to dry. Don’t continue to polish shiny paint, as you may dull the finish. As you polish the vehicle, the polishing compound will begin to build up on the pad.  Stop polishing occasionally to rinse the compound off of the pad, then wring the pad out again so it remains damp and fairly clean.  Once too much polish compound on the pad it will compromise its polishing ability. Remember to keep the pad damp throughout the process. The edge of the pad on the polishing wheel moves the fastest and usually comes into contact with the least of the rubbing compound, so it poses the biggest risk of burning the clear coat on your paint.  As a result, be extremely careful as you buff around trim components that may come into contact with the edges of the pad.  Take your time and avoid pressing the edge of the pad into any part of the car’s paint. Be patient and rub polishing compound out of grooves the polishing wheel can’t reach.","output":"The article provides a detailed guide on properly using a damp polishing wheel and polishing compound to polish a car, emphasizing the importance of maintaining even pressure, working on one body panel at a time, and regularly cleaning the pad to avoid damaging the vehicle's paint."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a goal: How to smooth antique radio. Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"To smooth an antique radio, you should follow a careful and methodical approach to preserve the original aesthetics and value of the radio while improving its appearance. Here are the steps to do that: Step 1: Assess the condition - Carefully examine the radio to determine which parts need smoothing. Check for chips, scratches, rough edges, and other wear. Determine if the issue is with the wooden or plastic parts, as the approach will differ slightly for each material. Step 2: Gather necessary materials - For wooden radios, gather sandpaper (varying grit levels), wood filler or putty, wood stain that matches the original color, and a soft cloth. - For plastic radios, gather fine sandpaper, plastic polish, and a soft cloth. Step 3: Clean the radio - Before starting, ensure the radio is unplugged and turned off. Carefully clean the surface with a damp cloth to remove any dust or dirt. Step 4: Smoothing process For wooden radios: - Start by lightly sanding the rough or chipped areas with a higher grit sandpaper (around 120-grit) to even out the surface. Be careful not to remove too much of the original finish.  - If necessary, fill in any small dents or scratches with wood filler or putty. Allow it to completely dry before proceeding. - Use progressively finer grit sandpaper (180, 220, 320-grit) to achieve a smooth finish. Always sand along the grain, and do not press too hard. - Wipe away any dust with a soft damp cloth, let it dry. - Use a matching wood stain on the smoothed areas, let it dry, and apply a second coat if necessary.  For plastic radios: - Use fine-grit sandpaper (600-grit) to lightly sand the rough or scratched areas. Ensure you do this evenly and avoid being too aggressive with your sanding. - Polish the sanded area with a plastic polish to improve shine and clarity. Buff out the polish using a soft cloth. Step 5: Final inspection - Inspect your work to make sure the smoothing has been successful and that the overall appearance has improved. Be sure to keep the radio's original character by remaining as close as possible to the original finish. This step-by-step approach attempts to preserve the antique radio's originality while smoothing out any imperfections. Feel free to modify these steps based on your specific radio and personal preferences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Write highlights for this article: It's hard to think about global warming when it's so cold that you can't suck in the air without pain. I stepped out on my porch in Vermont this morning -- I live in an old farmhouse with a panoramic view of the Green Mountains -- and could hardly breathe. The thermometer had dipped well below zero. I heard on the local radio that it was 70 below zero on Mount Washington, in New Hampshire, taking into account the wind chill. But I'm used to cold weather, having spent most of my adult life, almost four decades, in New Hampshire and Vermont. In fact, I remember the cold snaps of old, back in the 70s and early 80s, when for weeks on end the temperature would hover around zero, maybe creeping up to 10 or 15 at noon, when the sun looked like a pale and cheerless disc in the sky. There was a strange exhilaration in those sub-zero weeks: the sense of a vacuum, a silence that amounted to noise. You couldn't inhale, as it made your lungs ache. Your nose-hairs froze and breathing was difficult. Your glasses steamed up when you stepped into any building. It was important to dress in the most thoughtful ways, with layer upon layer of clothes, including a good set of silk underwear. Earmuffs were essential, as well as big fur hats, thick gloves, insulated boots and wool socks, the works. I have a photo that I love of the old poet, Robert Frost, in a winter hat with long earflaps, in heavy boots, a stick in hand. He is walking through a snowy field not far from where I live. He often wrote poems about being alone in the woods or fields in deep snow. I think, for instance, of \\"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening\\" or the ferocious \\"Goodbye, and Keep Cold,\\" where he says: \\"Dread fifty above more than fifty below.\\" He's speaking to a stand of trees that seem not to mind the arctic weather, these resilient \\"Maples and birches and tamarack.\\" I'm afraid that human beings rarely like it when it gets so cold. Only a week ago, I paid a fleeting visit to Key West, Florida, where it was almost 90 under the palm trees. Coming back to Vermont late one night, only a few days ago, I stepped from the airplane into the dark, icy weather, and I wondered how I could stand it. When I got to my car, the thermometer on my dashboard told me it was 10 below zero. And the wind howled as I drove through the dark snowy mountains to my house. Was I crazy to live in such a climate? This morning I met a friend, an elderly Vermonter, in a cafe. He said to me, \\"I don't know about you, but I feel comforted by this cold snap. It reminds me of the old days, before global warming. I feel as if the world isn't completely out of whack.\\" I doubt the world isn't out of whack when, on Wednesday, it was colder in New York City than it was in part of Antarctica. This is imbalance on a global scale, and it doesn't provide much comfort to move through a brief cold snap. We know that vast shelves of ice are melting at the poles. We know that this past year was the hottest on record. Only those with their heads buried deep in the sand can believe that climate change is not upon us and that fossil fuels are not changing this planet in ways that will make life difficult for our children and their children. Something has to be done, and quickly, or we'll be passing along to our heirs a ghastly wreck of a planet. We will have proved dreadful and selfish stewards of this precious earth. I don't expect the cold to last, not like in the old days. Yet while it does, for a brief while, I plan to enjoy it. I'm going to bundle up tight today -- silk underwear, hat, gloves, and insulated boots -- and go for a walk in the woods, just to savor the depth of silence, the sense of a world brought to a point of absolute and unimaginable stillness. Like Frost, I will say to my Vermont neighbors with a wry smile: \\"Goodbye, and Keep Cold.\\" I know they will smile back. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jay Parini. Highlights:","output":"1. The author reminisces about colder winters in the past, comparing them to the current cold snap and expressing nostalgia for such extreme temperatures. 2.

Zakariya Essabar, a Moroccan citizen, moved to Germany in February 1997 and to Hamburg in 1998, where he studied medical technology. Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \\"good man\\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by  Bin Laden. Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999. Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and chemistry. Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995. Mzoudi described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco, but much more devout when he was back in Hamburg. In April 1996, Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed the execution of Atta's will. During the course of 1999, Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive, speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations. 87 When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late that year, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation; no evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time. Witnesses have attested, however, that their pronouncements reflected ample predisposition toward taking some action against the United States. In short, they fit the bill for  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM. Going to Afghanistan The available evidence indicates that in 1999, Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah decided to fight in Chechnya against the Russians.

Continue the following story. The math test was easy for Kevin but not Nick because","output":"Nick had always struggled with mathematics. Even as a young child, he would get frustrated with simple arithmetic problems, much to the confusion of his family. Kevin, on the other hand, seemed to possess an innate ability to comprehend and manipulate numbers. The two boys had been best friends since kindergarten, but their diverging academic abilities created moments of tension and embarrassment for Nick. Over the years, Kevin had tried to help Nick better understand the subject. They would spend late nights reviewing formulas, equations, and complex problem-solving strategies. Despite Kevin's best efforts, however, Nick never made the progress he hoped to achieve. He continued to labor over math tests, often barely scraping by with a passing grade. The boys were now in their final year of high school, and they faced one last significant math exam: the dreaded calculus test that would determine their final grades and, in many ways, the trajectory of their academic futures. Kevin had spent the weeks leading up to the test in a state of calm confidence. He knew that he had the skills and knowledge to excel. Nick, however, spent his days in a fog of anxiety and despair. Desperate for help, Nick consulted their math teacher, Ms. Patel. She was an experienced educator who had seen her fair share of struggling students. She gently listened to Nick's concerns and offered her advice. She suggested that he try seeking help from a tutor or taking advantage of the after-school math club. Yet, Nick knew that he had tried all these tactics in prior years and found them of little benefit. As the day of the test approached, Nick's anxiety only grew. He couldn't shake the feeling that he would never measure up to his best friend, and he dreaded the moment when they would compare results. When the fateful day finally arrived, Nick sat down at his desk, the same knot in his chest he had come to expect each time he faced a math test. On the other hand, Kevin took to his seat with a sense of collected ease. He opened the test booklet and effortlessly moved from one problem to the next. The questions asked were well-aligned with the course material, and he felt comfortably challenged by the tasks before him. As he reached the end of the test, he couldn't help but feel confident in his performance. Meanwhile, Nick was struggling in his efforts to navigate through the questions. As he looked at the complex equations, his mind went blank. He could hardly recall any of the lessons he had worked tirelessly to understand. Kevin glanced over at Nick and quietly assessed his friend's situation. He never realized how much Nick truly struggled, and seeing his best friend wrestle with feelings of inferiority and frustration broke his heart. At that moment, Kevin made a decision. As he handed in his completed test, he asked Ms. Patel if he could be excused to the restroom. Once outside the classroom, Kevin sent Nick a text message, containing an offer of support during the remaining exam time. Nick gratefully accepted and found solace in knowing his friend was there for him - even if he couldn't change the outcome of the test. When the results came back, it was no surprise that Kevin received an outstanding grade. Nick managed to pass but only by the thinnest of margins. It wasn't the triumphant ending he had hoped for, but he couldn't help but feel a sense of relief that it was finally over. As they walked out of the school building, Nick turned to Kevin and expressed his gratitude for his unwavering support throughout their friendship. Kevin smiled and wrapped his arm around Nick's shoulders. \\"Remember, man,\\" Kevin said, \\"math is only one subject in the vast world of learning. We all have our strengths and weaknesses. I know you'll find your niche and excel in it.\\" Their lives continued to diverge as they embarked upon different paths after high school. Yet, despite their contrasting academic experiences, the bond they had forged through their shared struggles endured, only growing stronger as they faced the challenges and joys that life had in store for them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When Walt pleads, standing outside Jesse’s closed door, “We built this empire together — it’s all we have,” it’s hard not to get a little misty-eyed.

To protect its seagoing interests and trade routes, Portugal established strategic garrisons in Goa (India), Malacca (East Indies), and Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. Portuguese explorers then embarked upon Macau (now Macao), the Congo, and various other parts of Africa, including the Sudan. The Portuguese policy was to avoid armed strife and to develop a trade empire, rather than to conquer nations. To this end it succeeded with relatively few blood-soaked episodes in its colonial history. Adventures abroad, however, proved disastrous during the second half of the 16th century. In 1557 the 14-year-old boy-king Sebastião ascended the throne, the beginning of a calamitous reign that was to end at the battle of Alcacer-Quiber (Morocco) in pursuit of a vain crusade. Sebastião's untimely demise, alongside some 18,000 ill-prepared, badly led followers, set the stage for a crisis of succession. For many years afterwards, legends and rumors bizarrely insisted that the king was still alive, and imposters turned up from time to time claiming the throne; those who were plausible enough to be deemed a threat were summarily executed. In fact, the only rightful claimant to the crown was the elderly Prince Henry. But after two years of alternating between the throne and his sickbed, he died, heirless. Surveying the situation and smelling an opportunity, Spain occupied the power vacuum, and Portugal's neighbor and long-time antagonist became its master. Spanish rule dictated Portugal's inadvertent involvement in Spain's ongoing wars. In 1587 a squadron of British ships commanded by Francis Drake attacked the Algarve (now a \\"legitimate target\\" as Spanish territory) and sacked Sagres, thus depriving the world of the relics of Henry the Navigator. Nine years later Faro was torched. The 1386 Treaty of Windsor, by which Britain and Portugal had pledged eternal friendship, seemed a distant memory. Portugal's empire was gradually eroded, and many of its trading posts (with the notable exception of Brazil) were picked off by the British and Dutch. Finally, after 60 years of Spanish rule, Portuguese noblemen (aided by the French, then at war with Spain) organized a palace coup and restored independence. The Great Disaster Portugal's greatest misfortune struck on All Saint's Day, 1 November 1755.

Two engineersÂ â Aaron and AbeÂ â supplement their day-jobs with entrepreneurial tech projects, working out of Aaron's garage. During one such research effort, involving electromagnetic reduction of objects' weight, the two men accidentally discover an 'A-to-B' time loop side-effect; objects left in the weight-reducing field exhibit temporal anomalies, proceeding normally (from time 'A,' when the field was activated, to time 'B,' when the field is powered off), then backwards (from 'B' back to 'A'), in continuous A-then-B-then-A-then-B sequence, such that objects can leave the field in the present, or at some previous point.

The revelations about her relationship with the cabinet minister John Profumo hastened the end of the Macmillan government.      The resulting scandal, involving allegations of espionage and prostitution, and a dramatic court case, saw her pilloried in the tabloid press.      But Keeler was a somewhat naive victim of an establishment that was determined to protect its own position against what it saw as a tide of permissiveness.      Christine Keeler was born in Uxbridge, west London, on 22 February 1942.      Her father deserted the family while she was still a young child and her mother later set up home with Edward Huish, in a pair of converted railway carriages near Windsor.      She was sexually abused as a teenager both by her mother's lover and his friends, for whom she babysat.      Image copyright Getty Images Image caption She suffered an abusive childhood      Keeler left school with no qualifications and had a succession of jobs, including working in a gown showroom and a spell as a waitress. She also posed for some modelling pictures.      Platonic friendship      At the age of 17 she became pregnant. Attempts at a self-induced abortion failed but the child, a boy, died days after the birth.      \\"I was just 17, I did not have many illusions left, and the ones that did remain were soon to vanish.\\"      Keeler found a job in Murray's, a Soho nightclub, where she served drinks and posed semi-naked on the stage. She also befriended another model, Mandy Rice-Davies.      \\"When we weren't on stage, we were allowed to sit out with the audience for a hostess fee of £5,\\" she later wrote.      By her own account she, like a number of the girls, had sexual relationships with the club's clients, although it was officially forbidden by the management.      Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Her relationship with Stephen Ward was platonic      It was at Murray's that she met Stephen Ward, an osteopath who had a client list that included a number of rich and important people, including the former Conservative MP Viscount Astor.      Keeler moved into Ward's flat although the couple maintained a platonic friendship.      Ward took Keeler to parties where he introduced her to many of his friends including Peter Rachman, the notorious slum landlord, with whom she had a relationship.      Ward and Keeler were also frequent attendees at weekend parties at the Astors' Cliveden estate in Buckinghamshire.      Dismissed      At one of these events, on 8 July 1961, Keeler, splashing in the swimming pool, caught the attention of John Profumo, then Secretary of State for War.      Profumo, who was married to the actress Valerie Hobson, was seen as one of the government's rising stars. He kept in touch with Keeler and the pair had a brief affair.      Also at the party was Eugene Ivanov, assistant naval attaché at the Soviet Embassy, who was friendly with Ward.      Image copyright Getty Images Image caption John Profumo, here with his wife Valerie Hobson, was seen as a rising political star      Keeler later claimed she had been sleeping with Ivanov at the same time as she was having an affair with Profumo, but many commentators have since dismissed her account.      She had also been having relationships with two other men, Lucky Gordon and Johnny Edgecombe.      Gordon and Edgecombe quarrelled bitterly over Keeler, resulting in Edgecombe firing shots at a flat where Keeler was hiding.      The subsequent police investigation led the press to take an interest, and reporters soon learned of Keeler's relationship with Profumo.      'No impropriety'      Suspicions that Keeler had obtained secrets from Profumo and passed them to Ivanov, led Labour to decide the whole matter was a security issue.      With the press unwilling to risk a libel suit by publishing the story, Labour MP George Wigg used parliamentary privilege to accuse Profumo of having an affair with Keeler.      Profumo was forced to come to the House where he denied having sexual relations with Keeler.      Image copyright PA Image caption Stephen Ward was not destined to hear the verdict at his trial      \\"Miss Keeler and I were on friendly terms,\\" he told fellow MPs. \\"There was no impropriety whatsoever in my acquaintanceship with Miss Keeler.\\"      Meanwhile, Keeler had testified at the trial of Lucky Gordon, who she claimed had assaulted her. He was jailed for three years.      On 5 June, Profumo resigned as Secretary of State for War, having admitted that he had lied to the House of Commons about his relationship with Keeler.      Perjury      Stephen Ward was arrested and accused of living on Keeler's immoral earnings. His trial began at the Old Bailey in July 1963.      Image copyright PA Image caption Mandy Rice-Davies (l) was, with Keeler, a key witness in Ward's trial      In what the writer Ludovic Kennedy described as a blatant miscarriage of justice, Ward was convicted following a devastating summing up by the trial judge.      But, by the time the jury announced its verdict, Ward was in a coma, having taken an overdose of sleeping pills. He died in hospital three days later.      In December 1963 Lucky Gordon's sentence was overturned by the Court of Appeal, and Keeler was accused of lying at his trial.      She pleaded guilty to charges of perjury, and was sentenced to nine months in prison.      Scandal      Labour won the 1964 General Election, having used the Profumo affair to accuse the Conservatives of being unfit to govern.      On her release from prison, Christine Keeler largely disappeared from the public eye.      There were two marriages which did not last, but did produce two children.      Image copyright PA Image caption She had little time for a fusty establishment      Much of the money she had been paid by newspapers had disappeared by the 1970s.      She published five books about her life, one of which, entitled Scandal, was the basis for the 1989 film of the same name, which starred Joanne Whalley as Keeler.      As a young woman, Christine Keeler was desperate to get away from an unhappy home and make something of herself. She had little time for the fusty morals of a traditional establishment class.      Unfortunately for her, that class was desperate to maintain its influence in a country about to experience the dawn of the huge social changes of the 1960s.      That establishment was aided and abetted by a tabloid press, desperate to expose scandal, even where it didn't exist, just to maintain circulation.      \\"They wanted to hear about the sex of course,\\" she once said bitterly. \\"But not the rest. No one wanted to hear the rest.\\" ||||| Christine Keeler, a London showgirl whose simultaneous relationships with British war secretary John Profumo and a Soviet military attache produced the country's most notorious political scandal of the 1960s, died Dec. 4 at a hospital in Farnborough, England. She was 75.      Her son Seymour Platt announced the death on his Facebook page, noting that the cause was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.      The Profumo Affair, as it became known, has echoed through the years as one of the era's most lurid tabloid scandals, with hints of espionage, Cold War politics, class prejudice and sexual hypocrisy.      The case has stayed in the popular imagination in the form of theatrical plays, including a musical by Andrew Lloyd-Webber, a feature film and dozens of books — three of which were written by Ms. Keeler.      The Profumo Affair made the strikingly beautiful young woman from the British provinces a London celebrity and a perennial staple of headlines and gossip. A nude photograph of Ms. Keeler straddling a chair in 1963 became one of the decade's most famous images.      She was often described as the call girl — a term she adamantly rejected — who brought down Britain's ruling Conservative government. Profumo, a rising political star who held the cabinet post of secretary of state for war, saw his career go down in flames.            Christine Keeler in 1963. (Stf/AP)      He and Ms. Keeler met in 1961, when she was taking a dip in a swimming pool at the estate of a British lord. He was 46, married and wearing a dinner jacket; she was 19, free-spirited and wearing a smile.      They began an affair that lasted several months. At the same time, Ms. Keeler was seeing other men, including Yevgeny Ivanov, widely believed to be a Soviet spy.      Profumo, who was married to film actress Valerie Hobson, tried to conceal his affair with Ms. Keeler. But in 1962, another of her jealous lovers, Johnny Edgecombe, opened fire on the front door of the house where Ms. Keeler was living.      When she failed to appear as a witness at Edgecombe's trial, people began to wonder why. The full extent of the scandal came to light in 1963.      After the press learned that Ms. Keeler was keeping company with a Soviet spy, there was concern that she had been wheedling state secrets from Profumo during pillow talk. She said she had to devise clever ploys to keep her romantic (and geopolitical) rivals from bumping into each other.      1 of 66 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Notable deaths in 2017 View Photos Remembering those who died in 2017.

The scandal also led to the 1963 resignation of Britain's Conservative prime minister, Harold Macmillan.      \\"Christine was no spy,\\" her onetime lover, Edgecombe, said years later after he served a seven-year prison sentence. \\"She was far too scatterbrained. She was a party girl. A gorgeous-looking woman who liked men, liked sex and liked to be the center of attention.\\"      Ms. Keeler and a friend, Mandy Rice-Davies, who died in 2014, acquired a cheeky kind of notoriety, known for their looks and their airy dismissal of stuffy social standards.      When Lord Astor, the nobleman in whose swimming pool Ms. Keeler had been cavorting, denied that he was involved with the teenage Rice-Davies, she quipped in court, \\"Well, he would, wouldn't he?\\"      Wherever she turned, Ms. Keeler found herself caught up in legal trouble. She was convicted of perjury in the assault trial of another of her onetime lovers, a man named Lucky Gordon.      She found her connection to high society through a well-connected osteopath named Stephen Ward. In 1963, Ward went on trial for living off the \\"immoral earnings\\" of Ms. Keeler and Rice-Davies — a charge denied by all three.      \\"This is a political revenge trial — someone had to be sacrificed, and that was me,\\" Ward said at the time. Near the end of the trial, he took an overdose of sleeping pills. He was found guilty, then died days later without regaining consciousness.      The story of Profumo, Ward and Ms. Keeler was portrayed in director Michael Caton-Jones's 1989 film \\"Scandal,\\" in which Ms. Keeler was played by Joanne Whalley.      \\"You talk to Christine, and it all happened the day before yesterday,\\" the film's screenwriter, Michael Thomas, told the New York Times. \\"She says Ward's the only man she ever loved, and you believe her. It's a love story between two people who were the weapons of each other's destruction.\\"      Christine Margaret Keeler was born Feb. 22, 1942, in Uxbridge, England. Her father left the family when she was young, and she grew up with her mother and stepfather in an abandoned railroad car in rural Berkshire, England.      She lived in such fear of her stepfather, she said, that she kept a knife under her pillow. She left home for London when she was 15.      Over the years, she said she had liaisons with the Beatles' Ringo Starr and actors Warren Beatty, Peter Lawford and George Peppard. Ms. Keeler co-wrote three autobiographical books and had two brief marriages, to James Levermore and Anthony Platt.      Survivors include a son from each marriage and a granddaughter.      Profumo, once considered a potential candidate for British prime minister, reconciled with his wife and quietly worked on behalf of the poor and downtrodden. He died in 2006.      In her later years, Ms. Keeler lived in poverty. She adopted the name of C.M. Sloane as she struggled to find work in advertising, in a school cafeteria and as a receptionist.      \\"I mean, it's been a misery for me, living with Christine Keeler,\\" she told Britain's Observer newspaper in 2001. \\"Even a criminal has the right to a new life, but they made sure I did not have that. They just didn't stop calling me a prostitute for ever and ever and ever and ever. How can anyone live with that? I took on the sins of everybody, of a generation, really.\\" ||||| Showgirl’s affairs with Russian diplomat and British MP John Profumo caused one of UK’s biggest scandals of 20th century      Christine Keeler, the former model at the centre of the Profumo affair that shook British politics in the 1960s, has died aged 75, her family and a close friend have said.            Keeler, then a teenage model and showgirl, became famous for her role in the 1963 scandal that rocked the establishment when she had an affair with the Tory cabinet minister John Profumo and a Russian diplomat at the same time at the height of the cold war. Profumo was eventually forced to resign after lying to parliament about the affair.      Keeler’s son, Seymour Platt, 46, told the Guardian she died on Monday at the Princess Royal university hospital in Farnborough: “My mother passed away last night at about 11.30pm,” he said on Tuesday.            Quick guide The key players in the Profumo scandal Show Hide Christine Keeler A former model who was introduced to society figures by the osteopath Stephen Ward. In June 1961, when Keeler was 19, Ward introduced Keeler to John Profumo at a party at the Buckinghamshire stately home, Cliveden. Stephen Ward In 1963, Ward was tried for living off “immoral earnings” after claims that he introduced women including Mandy Rice-Davies and Keeler to rich clients. The case ended with Ward’s suicide. Mandy Rice-Davies The British model made a headline-grabbing appearance at Ward’s trial, claiming that her lovers included Viscount “Bill” Astor, the owner of Cliveden. Told that her alleged former lover denied her allegations, she answered: “Well, he would, wouldn’t he?” Rice-Davies died of cancer aged 70 in 2014. Yevgeny Ivanov The Soviet naval attaché had an affair with Keeler at the same time as Profumo. The romantic triangle led to Profumo, then secretary of state for war, resigning. John Profumo The affair nearly destroyed Harold Macmillan’s government. Profumo spent the rest of his life volunteering at Toynbee Hall, a charity in east London. He died in 2006, aged 91.      Written by Holly Watt Photograph: PA      She had been ill for several months, and suffered from the lung disease COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).            A major BBC series revisiting the scandal is due to start filming next year.            Keeler, who had been living under the name of Sloane for many years, was briefly married twice, both marriages ending in divorce. She had two sons – James from her first marriage, and Seymour from her second – and a granddaughter.            Platt, who lives in Ireland, said he, his wife and their daughter had last seen his mother a week ago. “There was a lot of good around Chris’s rather tragic life, because there was a family around her that loved her,” he said.      “I think what happened to her back in the day was quite damaging.”      Born in Uxbridge, Middlesex, and raised by her mother and stepfather, Keeler was working as a cabaret dancer in Soho in London when she met Stephen Ward, an osteopath, artist and “man about town”.      Christine Keeler obituary Read more      He introduced her to a party scene attended by aristocrats and VIPs, and through him, in 1961, she met both Profumo, then 46 and secretary of state for war, and the Russian military attache Yevgeny Ivanov, having affairs with both men.      When the relationships came to light in 1963, amid fears of a cold war security leak, the scandal rocked the Harold Macmillan government.      Profumo told the House of Commons there was no “impropriety” in their relationship after being asked about it by opposition MPs who voiced concerns about national security implications.            Eventually, after more newspaper stories emerged, he admitted lying to the house, and resigned from the cabinet and the Commons.            His fall from grace was deemed a contributory factor in the fall of the Macmillan government, with Labour winning under Harold Wilson in 1964.      Keeler met Mandy Rice-Davies when they worked as dancers in Soho and both women were involved with Ward’s social set. Ward would later be convicted of living off immoral earnings, with Keeler and Rice-Davies as the main witnesses, but he took a fatal overdose before the jury returned their guilty verdict in August 1963.      At the height of the Profumo affair, Keeler gave newspaper interviews and also posed for the now famous photograph of her sitting naked on a chair.      Lewis Morley took the photo at the request of Peter Cook as publicity for a film. Photograph: Lewis Morley/Sloane      The affair only came to light after an incident with Aloysius “Lucky” Gordon, a man whom Keeler’s family and friends said abused and stalked her. Shots were fired into the home of Ward, where Keeler was temporarily seeking refuge. When she was questioned during the subsequent police investigation, details of the affair became public.            At the end of 1963, Keeler was sentenced to nine months in prison for perjury in a case brought against Gordon, where she accused him of assault. She spent six months in Holloway prison.            Platt, a business analyst, said of his mother: “She was stalked [by Gordon] and didn’t really have anywhere to turn. It made her very vulnerable and extremely mistrusting of men. There weren’t a lot of male figures as I grew up because she wanted to protect me from men.”            Platt said his mother was from a generation where there was “great shame” and she had felt it when she recalled her past.      “But she shouldn’t have because, looking back, there was real good that came out of what happened. It did pull the curtain back, and there were changes in society that were needed.”            The photo that launched a thousand poses: photographing Christine Keeler Read more      He said she was a devoted, loving mother. “She was a good, decent person, and she got a very unfair label that was hard for her to live with.”      But the press had vilified her, he said. “She was just a young girl having fun during the burgeoning of sexual liberation. She picked up labels, which I think were quite unfair.”      She found her “notoriety” difficult, he said, and changed her name to Sloane in an attempt to gain anonymity.      “Chris was feisty. And she would never shy away from a fight. She had a terrific sense of fairness. She would stand up against anybody she thought was doing the wrong thing.      “And that is something I am very proud of. And hopefully, if there is one lesson I can learn from her, it would be that.”      Desmond Banks, who had known Keeler since her 20s, and was her solicitor, said: “She was an extraordinary woman, much misunderstood, who deserves redemption.”            The scandal had “overshadowed” her life, in particular the behaviour she suffered at the hands of Gordon, he said.      “Had it not been for “Lucky” Gordon, Christine and indeed, Profumo’s affair with her, would never have been known.”            He added: “I can’t think of anyone else who has had three musicals written about her, and several plays, and is seldom out of the news, for one reason or another.            “She was the last survivor of a story that gripped Great Britain and the world more than 50 years ago.”      • This article was amended on 5 December 2017 to amend some details about events relating to Aloysius “Lucky” Gordon. ||||| Solution:","output":"Christine Keeler, the central figure in a 1960s scandal that rocked the British government, has died at the age of 75.

The head of the legal system was officially the pharaoh, who was responsible for enacting laws, delivering justice, and maintaining law and order, a concept the ancient Egyptians referred to as Ma'at. Although no legal codes from ancient Egypt survive, court documents show that Egyptian law was based on a common-sense view of right and wrong that emphasized reaching agreements and resolving conflicts rather than strictly adhering to a complicated set of statutes. Local councils of elders, known as Kenbet in the New Kingdom, were responsible for ruling in court cases involving small claims and minor disputes. More serious cases involving murder, major land transactions, and tomb robbery were referred to the Great Kenbet, over which the vizier or pharaoh presided. Plaintiffs and defendants were expected to represent themselves and were required to swear an oath that they had told the truth. In some cases, the state took on both the role of prosecutor and judge, and it could torture the accused with beatings to obtain a confession and the names of any co-conspirators. Whether the charges were trivial or serious, court scribes documented the complaint, testimony, and verdict of the case for future reference.Punishment for minor crimes involved either imposition of fines, beatings, facial mutilation, or exile, depending on the severity of the offense. Serious crimes such as murder and tomb robbery were punished by execution, carried out by decapitation, drowning, or impaling the criminal on a stake. Punishment could also be extended to the criminal's family. Beginning in the New Kingdom, oracles played a major role in the legal system, dispensing justice in both civil and criminal cases. The procedure was to ask the god a \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" question concerning the right or wrong of an issue. The god, carried by a number of priests, rendered judgment by choosing one or the other, moving forward or backward, or pointing to one of the answers written on a piece of papyrus or an ostracon. Answer:","output":"In the New Kingdom, justice for both civil and criminal cases was dispensed by local councils of elders known as Kenbet for minor disputes, and the Great Kenbet for more serious cases, over which the vizier or pharaoh presided.

Sentence 2: The conclusions are that we are all perfect spiritual notions of one divine spirit and manifest the spirit , not a material body . Do these two sentences convey the same information?","output":"While these two sentences may appear similar at a glance, they convey slightly different information, primarily due to the choice of words and the specific phrasing used. Here, I will elaborate on the differences and similarities between the two sentences. Sentence 1: \\"The conclusions are that we are all manifestations of one perfect spiritual spirit and of the divine mind, not a material body.\\" In this sentence, the focus is on the idea that we are all manifestations (or expressions) of one \\"perfect spiritual spirit\\" and \\"the divine mind.\\" This suggests a strong connection between the spiritual spirit and the divine mind, implying that they are not separate entities but two facets of the same reality. The sentence emphasizes that our essence is not found in our material bodies but rather in this higher spiritual realm. Sentence 2: \\"The conclusions are that we are all perfect spiritual notions of one divine spirit and manifest the spirit, not a material body.\\" In this sentence, the primary focus is on the concept that we are all \\"perfect spiritual notions\\" of one divine spirit. The phrase \\"perfect spiritual notions\\" indicates that our true selves are idealized and potentially abstract spiritual concepts associated with the divine spirit. The sentence also states that we \\"manifest the spirit,\\" creating a more direct connection between our spiritual essence and the divine spirit. Despite the differences, both sentences share a common theme in emphasizing the spiritual over the material aspect of existence. They both reject the idea that our essence is found in our material bodies and propose that our true nature is deeply connected to a greater spiritual reality. In summary, while these two sentences convey similar overarching ideas, they present nuanced differences in how our connection to the divine spirit and spiritual essence are characterized. Sentence 1 focuses on the connection between the spiritual spirit and the divine mind, highlighting that we are manifestations of this union. Sentence 2, on the other hand, emphasizes the concept that we are all perfect spiritual notions associated with a single divine spirit and that we manifest this spirit."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is the subject line for this email? Carol,  Hope things have calmed down for you this week. We are looking at Enron's proposed master netting agreement that Sara Shackleton sent to Beth Ng last week. We should be able to send her comments on that shortly. Also, we would like to get your comments on our form cover sheet to the EEI master, which McDermott, Will & Emery has sent to you on our behalf. Meanwhile, we would like to explore additional means to manage our credit risk to each other, particularly in light of the multiple affiliated parties in which we each trade. As we discussed last week, one way to do so is to do a series of trades that would result in the close-out of existing positions, corresponding settlement payments, and the reestablishment of the positions through new trades at market. A startegy such as the following would probably require implementation by means of numerous trades. Although the proposed strategy will result in cash payments, one goal of the proposed strategy is for the two group of companies to remain cash neutral. Here is an example of how the strategy would work:  Assume (These exposures are purely hypothetical and are not intended to represent the values of transactions between Morgan Stanley and Enron entities):  1)A)   Based on Swaps and cash settled Options, MSCGI has exposure (before collateral) to ENAC in the amount of 40 MM, ENAC's threshold is 5  MM and MSCGI is holding collateral in the amount of 35 MM, for an exposure net of Collateral of 5 MM. B)  Based on UK Gas, UK Electricity, German Electricity trades, ECTRL in London has exposure to MSCGI in the amount of 10 MM. 2)  ENAC and MSCGI agree to: (i) book out certain Swaps and Options resulting in ENAC paying 10 MM to MSCGI; (ii) reestablish those positions through new trades at market; and (iii) amend the ENAC/MSCGI CSA to provide that notwithstanding the mark-to-market Exposure of all outstanding Swaps and Options, MSCGI is entitled to hold 10 MM of the existing Collateral as a separate Independent Amount. 3)  MSCGI and ECTRL book-out all of the existing UK Gas, UK Electricity, German Electricity trades, resulting in MSCGI paying 10 MM to ECTRL. MSCGI and ECTRL reestablish the UK Gas, UK Electricity, German Electricity positions through new trades at market. After all of these trades and amendments are completed, the status of the parties are  as follows:  A)  MSCGI has exposure (before collateral) to ENAC in the amount of 40 MM - 10 MM = 30 MM. ENAC's threshold is still 5 MM. MSCGI continues to hold collateral in the amount of 35 MM (the new Independent Amount of 10 MM + the collateral of 25 MM for the new required Exposure, i.e., 25 MM = 30 MM - 5 MM). MSCGI's exposure to ENAC net of Collateral = of 5 MMNAC owes MSCGI 145.0 MM (before 140 MM of cash collateral) on Electricity Forwards, Options and settled trades (for an exposure net of collateral equal to 5.0 MM); and  B)  MSCGI owes ECTRL 0 MM on UK Gas, UK Electricity, German Electricity and settled trades. The amendment to the CSA described in (2)(iii) above is required. Otherwise, the new exposure before collateral would be 40 MM - 10 MM = 30 MM. With collateral previously posted equal to 35 MM, ENAC might request that MSCGI return collateral equal to 10 MM. Without the Independent Amount of 10 MM, ENAC's Required Collateral would equal 30 MM - 5 MM = 25 MM. If MSCGI were required to return the 10 MM as a result of these trades, it would defeat the purpose of the proposed strategy being cash neutral. Thus, to stay cash neutral, this proposal only works to the extent that it is possible to amend the ENAC/MSCGI CSA to create this right of MSCGI to hold collateral as an Independent Amount at least equal to the amount that MSCGI must pay ECTRL under the booked-out UK Gas, UK Electricity and German Electricity trades. Alternatively, it would work in any cases where the trading relationships between MS and Enron entities do not currently have either party posting collateral to the other, since we can take a similar approach to take advantage of potentially opposite exposures involving other MS and Enron commodities trading relationships.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Why are all the strikes, rallies, protest movements, judicial tussles etc. in India getting no media attention? Why isn't the PM of India (Modi) paying any attention towards OROP despite the protest of the servicemen in India? Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"No, the two questions you asked do not carry the same meaning, though they are related. They both touch on issues of visibility, or lack thereof, on certain public matters in India. However, they focus on different perspectives and scopes. The first question is asking about why multiple forms of public civil action such as strikes, rallies, and protest movements, as well as judicial confrontations - which are a significant part of a democratic society's functioning - do not receive media attention in India. It implies a concern about the alleged absence of media coverage or the perceived biased reporting of such events in the country. There might be several reasons for this purported phenomenon, which largely depend on the particularities of the Indian media landscape and political climate. Possible explanations could include media biases, governmental influence on the media, the power of corporate interests, journalistic self-censorship due to fear of retaliatory actions, or the concentration of media ownership. Note that these are speculative points, as without a detailed study it would be hard to confirm what's actually happening. The second question primarily focuses on a specific issue - the non-implementation or overlooked issues of One Rank One Pension (OROP) scheme by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, despite the protests from servicemen. OROP is a long-standing demand from the military community, advocating for the same pension, for same rank, for same length of service, irrespective of the date of retirement. While this question too deals with the invisibility theme, its scope is narrower than the first question, specifically focusing on a particular legislative matter and the Prime Minister's role. The difference between the two questions can perhaps best be illustrated like this: the first question is casting a wide net, looking at the general landscape of protests, strikes, and other demonstrations of civil unrest, along with the role of media. It could involve everything from the farmers' protests to the strikes for better pay. The second question, on the other hand, uses a laser focus on one issue - the government's response (or lack thereof) to demands for implementing OROP. Therefore, while they both touch on issues of visibility in public affairs, these two questions are distinct in their meaning, scope, and implications. The first examines the issue from a broader societal and media-centric point of view, while the second delves into the specifics of a particular political and legislative issue and the role and responsibility of the country's supreme leader in addressing it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Analyzing the initial statement: \\"girls jump rope in out pepper pepper old man wipes his brow.\\" This sentence seems to describe a scene in which girls are jumping rope while playing a game involving the words \\"in\\" and \\"out\\" and repeating the word \\"pepper\\". Additionally, an old man is present, observing the girls and wiping his brow, possibly due to heat or exertion. 2. Considering the statement: \\"girls don't jump rope.\\" This statement is negating the act of girls jumping rope. It implies that girls are not participating in any jump rope activities. Now, to evaluate whether the second statement follows the first one, I will compare the two. By observing the initial statement, we can see that it clearly states that the girls are engaging in a jump rope activity. This contradicts the statement \\"girls don't jump rope.\\" Therefore, the statement \\"girls don't jump rope\\" does not follow from the initial statement, as the initial statement actually supports the idea that girls do jump rope."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Next question: the unit of energy used to quantify the amount of energy in food is?","output":"The unit of energy used to quantify the amount of energy in food is called the calorie. Calorie is a widely-used metric to express the amount of energy derived from the consumption of food and beverages. One calorie is defined as the amount of energy necessary to increase the temperature of one kilogram of water by 1 degree Celsius (sometimes referred to as a kilocalorie in scientific contexts). However, in the realm of nutrition and food sciences, the term calorie is extensively employed and usually refers to the kilocalorie. The calorie content in food and beverages as a means of expressing energy values is of particular importance for various reasons. It is crucial in understanding the nutritional value of food, as the energy provided by a particular food item is vital for sustaining a healthy lifestyle. Consuming adequate calorie-rich food is essential for an individual to perform daily activities, maintain metabolic functions, and ensure overall well-being. Different nutrients supply varying amounts of energy per gram. Carbohydrates and proteins each provide about 4 calories per gram, while fats contribute approximately 9 calories per gram. Alcohols, though not essential nutrients, contribute around 7 calories per gram. The energy derived from these macronutrients support the myriad of bodily functions, including growth, maintenance, and repair. To sustain optimal health, individuals must strike a delicate balance between their caloric intake and energy expenditure. Caloric intake, or the number of calories consumed through food and beverages, must align with the energy requirements of an individual. The total energy expended is directly proportional to one's basal metabolic rate (BMR), which is the energy necessary for maintaining base physiological functions. Additionally, an individual's level of physical activity, age, gender, and overall health contribute to the determination of one's daily caloric requirements. Understanding the calories in food empowers individuals to make better dietary choices. Consuming excessive calories can lead to weight gain and a plethora of health problems, such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. On the other hand, inadequate calorie intake can result in malnutrition, muscle wasting, and impaired immune function. By recognizing the impact of calories and monitoring caloric intake, individuals can optimize their energy balance, maintain a healthy weight, and reduce the risk of diet-related complications.
