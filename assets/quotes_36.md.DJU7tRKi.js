Answer: In spite of an urgent need for UAVs or drones to provide round the clock coverage for American troops during the Iraq War, the USAF did not establish a new career field for piloting them until the last year of that war and in 2014 changed its RPA training syllabus again, in the face of large aircraft losses in training, and in response to a GAO report critical of handling of drone programs.  A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? Choose from:  - yes.  - no.","output":"Yes. The United States Air Force (USAF) established a new career field for piloting Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and drones during the Iraq War, which lasted from 2003 to 2011. This urgency was due to the need for continuous coverage and support for American troops during the war. As the conflict progressed, the USAF continually adapted and refined its training programs to address concerns about the handling of drone operations and to minimize losses. In the final year of the Iraq War, the USAF officially created a career field dedicated to piloting UAVs and drones, as their importance on the battlefield became more evident. The development and implementation of drone technology transformed warfare, allowing for improved surveillance, reconnaissance, and targeted strikes, with reduced risk to human pilots. By 2014, the USAF made further changes to its Remote Piloted Aircraft (RPA) training syllabus in response to significant aircraft losses in training exercises and a critical Government Accountability Office (GAO) report. This report highlighted the need for improved management and handling of drone programs, as the USAF sought to optimize their use in modern warfare. Overall, the establishment of a specialized career field for UAVs and drone piloting in the USAF during the Iraq War signaled a significant shift in military strategy and prioritization. This development demonstrated the growing recognition of the importance of these technologies within the context of modern conflict, and an effort to meet the changing demands and challenges of warfare in the 21st century."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, the mass of the water in the tub is much greater than the mass of the soup in the pot. This means that there are many more particles of water than soup. All those moving particles give the water in the tub greater total kinetic energy, even though their average kinetic energy is less. Therefore, the water in the tub has greater thermal energy than the soup. To compare the thermal energy of some other materials, go to the following URL and click on the interactive animation “Temperature and Thermal Energy.”  Tim is trying to boil two pots of water, pot A and pot B. Tim has a device which lets him see what the average kinetic energy is of the particles in each pot is. After examining each pot, Tim discovers that pot A has particles with a very high average kinetic energy, and pot B's particles have a low average kinetic energy.  Which pot is closer to boiling? The answer is:","output":"Pot A is closer to boiling because it has particles with a very high average kinetic energy, which indicates a higher temperature. When water reaches its boiling point (100°C or 212°F at sea level), its particles have enough kinetic energy to overcome the attractive forces and change from a liquid to a gas state.

Question: Kelsey is bored in class, and sees a coil of wire with electricity running through it. There is a box of random pieces of iron on the teacher's desk so she goes and picks up two of them. Piece A she simply puts on her desk to use later, and Piece B she slowly passes through the coil of wire.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which piece of iron is more magnetized?  Hint: Our knowledge of electromagnets developed from a series of observations. In 1820, Hans Oersted discovered that a current-carrying wire produced a magnetic field. Later in the same year, André-Marie Ampere discovered that a coil of wire acted like a permanent magnet and François Arago found that an iron bar could be magnetized by putting it inside of a coil of current-carrying wire. Finally, William Sturgeon found that leaving the iron bar inside the coil greatly increased the magnetic field. Answer:","output":"Piece B is more magnetized. Step 1: Identify the key information in the paragraph. The paragraph provides information about electromagnets, mentioning that a coil of wire acts like a permanent magnet and an iron bar can be magnetized by putting it inside a coil of current-carrying wire. Step 2: Relate the information to the question. The question is asking which piece of iron is more magnetized. Since Kelsey puts Piece A on her desk and does not interact with the coil of wire, it does not have any magnetization. On the other hand, Kelsey passes Piece B through the coil of current-carrying wire, which should magnetize it according to the information provided. Step 3: Determine the answer based on the information and the question. Based on the fact that Piece B is passed through the coil of wire and Piece A is left on the desk, Piece B is more magnetized due to the interaction with the magnetic field created by the current in the coil of wire."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Now as adults, Jerry, a paranormal investigator, and Dale, a journalist, frequently visit abandoned hotels, mansions, and asylums in the hopes of encountering supernatural beings. One such hotel, Hotel Holloway, stands apart from the rest. Built in the 1920s, the hotel is known for its haunted past, including the famous Holloway Massacre of 1936, where many guests mysteriously vanished and were never seen again. Jerry and Dale had visited the hotel many times, but never experienced any paranormal activity. Recently, Dale stumbles upon an old journal written by the hotel's former manager, Mr. Walters, before their next visit to the hotel. He discovers that the journal contains cryptic puzzles and secrets about the hotel's dark history. However, due to the unsettling discovery, Dale chooses not to disclose this new information to Jerry. On the visit to Hotel Holloway, Jerry and Dale find themselves in the midst of bizarre and inexplicable occurrences. In the confusion of these mysterious events, Dale accidentally gets separated from Jerry in the hotel. Things become even worse when Jerry realizes that not only is Dale missing, but all of their recording equipment, including cameras, EVP recorders, and Dale's journal, are stolen. Believing that their experiences stem from supernatural beings, Jerry becomes even more obsessed with Hotel Holloway. Feeling responsible for their newfound misfortunes, Dale leaves the hotel and goes on a solo mission to find answers. He starts to work on decoding the puzzles in Mr. Walters' journal, unbeknownst to Jerry who is still at the hotel. Determined to help his longtime friend, Jerry convinces Dale to return to the hotel, promising him that everything will be fine.

It is a soft, grey, ductile transition metal, which is often found in the pyrochlore mineral, the main commercial source for niobium, and columbite. The name comes from Greek mythology: \\"Niobe\\", daughter of \\"Tantalus\\" since it is so similar to tantalum.  - Stibnite, sometimes called antimonite, is a sulfide mineral with the formula SbS. This soft grey material crystallizes in an orthorhombic space group. It is the most important source for the metalloid antimony. The name is from the Greek  \\"stibi\\" through the Latin \\"stibium\\" as the old name for the mineral and the element antimony.  - Pyrochlore (Na,Ca)NbO(OH,F) is a mineral group of the niobium end member (pyrochlore supergroup).  - A metalloid is any chemical element which has properties in between those of metals and nonmetals, or that has a mixture of them. There is neither a standard definition of a metalloid nor complete agreement on the elements appropriately classified as such. Despite the lack of specificity, the term remains in use in the literature of chemistry.  - Lead, from the Old English \\"léad\\", is a chemical element with atomic number 82 and symbol Pb (after the Latin, \\"plumbum\\"). It has the second highest atomic number of all practically stable elements. As such, lead is located at the end of some decay chains of heavier elements, which in part accounts for its relative abundance: its stability exceeds those of other similarly-numbered elements. Lead is a soft, malleable, and heavy metal. Freshly cut lead has a bluish-white color that soon tarnishes to a dull grayish color when exposed to air; as a liquid, it has a shiny chrome-silver luster. Lead's density of 11.34 g/cm exceeds those of most common materials.   - A mineral is a naturally occurring chemical compound, usually of crystalline form and abiogenic in origin. A mineral has one specific chemical composition, whereas a rock can be an aggregate of different minerals or mineraloids. The study of minerals is called mineralogy.  - Antimony is a chemical element with symbol Sb (from ) and atomic number 51. A lustrous gray metalloid, it is found in nature mainly as the sulfide mineral stibnite (SbS). Antimony compounds have been known since ancient times and were powdered for use as medicine and cosmetics, often known by the Arabic name, kohl. Metallic antimony was also known, but it was erroneously identified as lead upon its discovery. In the West, it was first isolated by Vannoccio Biringuccio and described in 1540.  - Vannoccio Biringuccio, sometimes spelt Vannocio Biringuccio (c. 1480  c. 1539), was an Italian metallurgist. He is best known for his manual on metalworking, \\"De la pirotechnia\\", published posthumously in 1540. Biringuccio is considered by some as the father of the foundry industry as \\"De la pirotechnia\\" is the first printed account of proper foundry practice. It also gives details of mining practice, the extraction and refining of numerous metals, alloys such as brass, and compounds used in foundries and explosives.  It preceded the printing of \\"De re metallica\\" by Georgius Agricola by 14 years.  - In chemistry and physics, the atomic number of a chemical element (also known as its proton number) is the number of protons found in the nucleus of an atom of that element, and therefore identical to the charge number of the nucleus. It is conventionally represented by the symbol Z. The atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element. In an uncharged atom, the atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons.  - A chemical element or element is a species of atoms having the same number of protons in their atomic nuclei (i.e. the same atomic number, \\"Z\\"). There are 118 elements that have been identified, of which the first 94 occur naturally on Earth with the remaining 24 being synthetic elements. There are 80 elements that have at least one stable isotope and 38 that have exclusively radioactive isotopes, which decay over time into other elements. Iron is the most abundant element (by mass) making up Earth, while oxygen is the most common element in the Earth's crust.  - Stibiconite is an antimony oxide mineral with formula : Sb3O6 ( OH ) . Its name originates from Greek \`\` stibi '' ( antimony ) and \`\` konis '' ( powder ) , alluding to its composition and habit . It is a member of the pyrochlore super group .    What entity does 'stibiconite' has the relation 'subclass of' with? The answer to this question is:","output":"Stibiconite has the relation 'subclass of' with the pyrochlore supergroup. The pyrochlore supergroup is a group of minerals with a general formula A2B2X6Y, where A, B, X, and Y represent various elements. Stibiconite is a member of this supergroup due to its antimony oxide mineral composition with the formula Sb3O6 (OH). Pyrochlores are typically found in various geological environments such as pegmatites, carbonatites, and alkaline intrusive complexes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: This article: When Richard II was crowned in 1377, he led a procession from the Tower to Westminster Abbey. This tradition began in at least the early 14th century and lasted until 1660. During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 the Tower of London was besieged with the King inside. When Richard rode out to meet with Wat Tyler, the rebel leader, a crowd broke into the castle without meeting resistance and looted the Jewel House. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Simon Sudbury, took refuge in St John's Chapel, hoping the mob would respect the sanctuary. However, he was taken away and beheaded on Tower Hill. Six years later there was again civil unrest, and Richard spent Christmas in the security of the Tower rather than Windsor as was more usual. When Henry Bolingbroke returned from exile in 1399, Richard was imprisoned in the White Tower. He abdicated and was replaced on the throne by Bolingbroke, who became King Henry IV. In the 15th century, there was little building work at the Tower of London, yet the castle still remained important as a place of refuge. When supporters of the late Richard II attempted a coup, Henry IV found safety in the Tower of London. During this period, the castle also held many distinguished prisoners. The heir to the Scottish throne, later King James I of Scotland, was kidnapped while journeying to France in 1406 and held in the Tower. The reign of Henry V (1413–1422) renewed England's fortune in the Hundred Years' War against France. As a result of Henry's victories, such as the Battle of Agincourt, many high-status prisoners were held in the Tower of London until they were ransomed.Much of the latter half of the 15th century was occupied by the Wars of the Roses between the claimants to the throne, the houses of Lancaster and York. The castle was once again besieged in 1460, this time by a Yorkist force. The Tower was damaged by artillery fire but only surrendered when Henry VI was captured at the Battle of Northampton.

Movie title: Jamaica Inn Movie plot: Jamaica Inn is the headquarters of a gang of wreckers led by the innkeeper Joss Merlyn (Leslie Banks). The wreckers are responsible for a series of engineered shipwrecks in which they extinguish coastal warning beacons to cause ships to run aground on the rocky Cornish coast. Then they kill the surviving sailors and steal the cargo from the wrecks. Beautiful, young Mary Yellan (Maureen O'Hara) is travelling to Jamaica Inn in a carriage, but the driver is afraid to stop there and drives a long way past the inn in spite of her repeated demands that he stop. Instead, he drops her off near the home of the local squire and justice of the peace, Sir Humphrey Pengallan (Charles Laughton). She meets him and requests the loan of a horse so she can go back to Jamaica Inn. Pengallan warns her not to go there. Nevertheless, Mary says she just came from Ireland, and as the orphaned niece of Joss's wife Patience (Marie Ney), she intends to live at Jamaica Inn. Unable to convince her to stay, Pengallan accompanies Mary to Jamaica Inn. When Joss meets Mary, he tries to kiss her and push himself on her. Patience is distraught to learn her sister, Mary's mother, has died. When Mary tells Joss that Pengallan has accompanied her to Jamaica Inn, Joss goes upstairs and reports to Pengallan. We learn that Pengallan is the secret criminal mastermind behind the wrecking gang, who finds out when well-laden ships are passing near the coast, determines when and where the wrecks are to be done, disposes of the stolen cargo, and uses the booty to support his lavish lifestyle, passing a small fraction of the takings back to Joss and the gang.

I have had 3 visits here and I can truthfully conclude that it is not my favorite place to be.  1st- Just trying it out and had their pasta. It was overly cheesy and it left me feeling disappointed, but my friend enjoyed his French Dip. Frozen Chocolate however was delicious.  2nd- Bought their \\"New Years Package\\" to ring in 2012 and this time was probably the best time out of the bunch. The manager was handled all of the booking and payment answered every email I had with inquiries very diligently and I appreciated that. For about 175 per person we were able to dine window-side inside and had a fantastic view of the strip. Our table was beautifully decorated with many fun adornments for us to use when it came time for the fireworks and also a complimentary glass of champagne for celebration time. Our server that night, however, was NONEXISTENT! The only things he did was bring us our drinks and took our food order. The busser was who came out to give us our food. This completely pissed me off because gratuity was already added on to take care of him. Of course there were times where we wanted to order more, needed refills, or something else and he was either on his phone near the back of the room or nonexistent. The food was seriously lacking with tasteless angus steak and the best thing was the crabcakes. Nonetheless, when it came time for the fireworks, we went right on outside and counted down with everyone else on the strip.  3rd- We had a party of 8 and I attempted to get a table for us around 9 PM. Plenty of open seats and the rest of my party went to the \\"treats\\" section to look at everything since I had people visiting from out of town so this place intrigued them. I was told by the hostess to go round up my party again and we would be seated immediately. I rounded them up after they just started looking around only to be told it will take 5 minutes to seat us, but it ended up being about 10 minutes. I am not trying to be picky, but if you are going to tell me to do something then also follow up on your promise as well please. I was told from our server that they no longer had Frozen Hot Chocolate so I opted for the Cookies and Cream Shake which I honestly have to say was even better!   Overall, if I can avoid going here again.. I would definitely avoid it. High prices for sucky food and desserts. Best things are their expensive shakes, lol.

Despite initial expansion attempts, Greece faced defeat in the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922.

The Greek exodus became permanent and expanded through an official population exchange between Greece and Turkey, as agreed upon in the Treaty of Lausanne, which marked the end of the war.

Question: Given the following context:  During a Fitzroy Football Club benefit concert with other Neighbours cast members, Minogue performed \\"I Got You Babe\\" as a duet with actor John Waters, and \\"The Loco-Motion\\" as an encore. She was subsequently signed to a recording contract with Mushroom Records in 1987. Her first single, \\"The Locomotion\\", spent seven weeks at number one on the Australian singles charts and became the country's highest-selling single in the 1980s. She received the ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single. Its success resulted in Minogue travelling to England with Mushroom Records executive Gary Ashley to work with producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman. They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving; as a result, they wrote \\"I Should Be So Lucky\\" while she waited outside the studio. The song reached number one in the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Finland, Switzerland, Israel and Hong Kong. Minogue won her second consecutive ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single, and received a \\"Special Achievement Award\\". Minogue's debut album, Kylie was released in July 1988. The album was a collection of dance-oriented pop tunes and spent more than a year on the UK Albums Chart, including several weeks at number one. The album went gold in the United States, and the single, \\"The Locomotion\\", reached number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, and number one on the Canadian Singles Chart. The single \\"Got to Be Certain\\" became her third consecutive number one single on the Australian music charts. Later in the year, she left Neighbours to focus on her music career. Minogue also collaborated with Jason Donovan for the song \\"Especially for You\\", which peaked at number-one in the United Kingdom and in December 2014 sold its one millionth copy in the UK.

After the opening three games of the campaign, More now have only a 50% record and sit in fourth place, two points behind local rivals Kingussie, who won 2-0 at home to Glenurquhart. In the only other Premiership game to survive the weather, Lovat collected their first points with a 4-2 win at Balgate over newly-promoted Kilmallie. Skye went top of the National Division with a 3-1 away win over Oban Celtic. Andrew McCuish got Oban Camanachd's opener after 18 minutes, then Lorn Dickie made it 2-0 before the half-hour. And it remained that way until midway through the second half, when Newtonmore talisman Glen MacKintosh pulled one back. This was as much as the champions could muster, with a Andy MacKintosh red card hindering their cause. Newtonmore have now dropped three points in their first three games, compared with just four during the previous two complete seasons. Unbeaten Kingussie and Glenurquhart met at The Dell, and it looked as both sides would preserve their successful starts to the season when the game entered its final quarter still goalless.

In Kiltarlity, Kilmallie looked to be on easy street Ryan Stewart, then Mark Graham gave the Lochaber side a 2-0 lead over Lovat. But Graham's strike seemed to galvanise their opponents, and Greg Matheson had them level within six minutes before Lorne MacKay put the home club ahead before half time. MacKay's second, midway through the second period, then put the game beyond Kilmallie and prevented Lovat from suffering a third straight defeat.

Put the berries in the container: Gently place all your sorted, good berries on top of the paper towels in the plastic container. Be careful not to squash them! 4. Put the lid on the container: Now, you need to cover your container of berries with a lid. But don't close it all the way – just let it rest a little bit open. That way, some air can go in and out. This helps to keep your berries fresh for longer! 5. Keep the berries in the refrigerator: It's time for your berries to take a little break in the cold! Put your container of berries in the refrigerator, but make sure you don't put it in the coldest part, like the freezer. The fridge will help to slow down the berries from getting too ripe too fast.

On one hand, some people think that they should have a car when they have enough money, and then it's easy to go out and they can feel comfortable. On the other hand, a growing number of people hope to use their cars to show off  . What's more, years of research has shown that one of other reasons for the traffic jam is the driving habit. For example, many young people enjoy driving very fast, so they can feel excited. At last, most of them hardly care about the speed rules. Many governments are working at how to make the traffic better. In my opinion, firstly, the governments should educate those people who have cars or plan to buy cars. The governments must make them know that the traffic jam is very serious, and set up a much more perfect traffic system to solve the traffic pressure. Question: Which of the following is NOT true? Options: A: The reason for the traffic jam is that people have too much work. B: The reason for the traffic jam is that more and more people drive cars. C: The reason for the traffic jam is that some people want to show off. D: The reason for the traffic jam is that some people don't have good driving habits.

The case of BPN was particularly serious because of its size, market share, and the political implications - Portugal's then current President, Cavaco Silva, and some of his political allies, maintained personal and business relationships with the bank and its CEO, who was eventually charged and arrested for fraud and other crimes.

Today, I want to tell you a story about a policewoman named PC Saheena Tegally. She is in a little bit of trouble because she did something she wasn't supposed to do. Let's learn what happened. One day, while Saheena was out with her two police friends in Highgate, a place in north London, they saw a man driving a car. They stopped him because they thought he didn't have something called \\"car insurance.\\" That's like a special promise that if the car gets hurt or anything bad happens, a special helper called an \\"insurance company\\" will help fix everything, but the car's owner has to pay them some money first. It's important because the law says every car owner must have it. After they pulled the man over, which means they stopped his car to talk to him, Saheena started to do something she wasn't supposed to do. She sent the man messages on her phone, just a few hours after they stopped his car. Yikes! That's not what a police officer should do. Now, Saheena is in trouble because people think she tried to hide the truth about the man's car not having insurance. This is very serious because police officers are supposed to always be honest! They need to keep everyone safe and follow the rules of the law, and not pretend like something isn't wrong when it really is. Saheena is 35 years old, and she is saying that she didn't do anything wrong. She says she didn't try to change the way things were supposed to happen. This is called \\"perverting the course of justice,\\" which means making something happen that isn't true or right. So, little friends, that's the story about Policewoman Saheena. Remember, it's always important to tell the truth and follow the rules, so everyone can be safe and happy! And if you see a police officer working hard to keep your neighborhood safe, don't forget to give them a big smile and say, \\"Thank you!\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When Abbe Suger rebuilt Saint Denis Basilica outside Paris in the early 12th century, he added stained glass windows colored blue cobalt glass and red glass tinted with copper.

Today, many academics feel stuck between a rock and a hard place. They’re under huge pressure to write and publish but an ever-growing mountain of teaching and admin is stopping them doing just that. Our research finds that whilst nobody is immune to these pressures, some academics cope better than others – and that’s because over the years, they’ve developed personal “systems” to help them write. We recently carried out in-depth interviews with 23 scholars across the UK, Europe and the US. We deliberately chose a diverse group so as to not make any assumptions based on age, seniority, or research background. Academic experience ranged from six months to 27 years and subject fields ranged from social sciences, economics, business, and arts. We did this as part of our user research to inform the development of Prolifiko – a digital coaching tool for writers. Whilst every academic had developed a writing productivity system personal to them, we found there were six common “habits” that the most prolific (and generally least stressed) academics tended to use. 1. They “time-block” their writing in advance Scheduling – booking in time to write in advance – was the single most common habit of our writers. It didn’t appear to matter what type of time-blocking method a scholar chose to use or how lengthy a writing session was. Some blocked out long periods of time on sabbatical, whilst others preferred to block out short, regular times throughout the day or across a week. What seemed to matter far more was the act of planning, as this mentally prepared the individual for writing – and so made the process easier and less stressful. “When I need to write I block out time. I’m lucky in that I can work from home – I block out a couple of straight days to do the writing and I plan it in beforehand. I couldn’t really write in any other way than blocking out that time.” Researchers found that writers who don't time-block their writing in advance probably: Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. not enough information  B.

A: 1. Stick the end of the hot dog with a firm sharp stick, making sure it's secure - This ensures that the hot dog will not fall into the fire and will cook evenly. 2. Hold the hot dog over the fire (not in the fire) - This avoids charring the hot dog and ensures the hot dog cooks more evenly. 3. Rotate to prevent burning until cooked to your liking - Rotating the hot dog will evenly distribute the heat, ensuring the entire hot dog cooks more consistently. B: 1. Stick the end of the hot dog with a firm sharp stick, making sure it's secure - This ensures that the hot dog will not fall into the fire and will cook evenly. 2. Hold the hot dog over the fire (preferably in the fire) - This step can result in burning or charring the hot dog, leading to uneven cooking. 3. Do not rotate as this will prevent burning and will not cook to your liking - Not rotating the hot dog can cause different parts of the hot dog to cook unequally, as one side may be exposed to higher heat at one time. By comparing the steps, Choice A appears to be the better solution. It helps ensure even cooking, prevents burning, and allows for personal preference in cooking. Choice B has a higher risk of burning and uneven cooking due to its method.

Intellectual property: The stated objective of most intellectual property law (with the exception of trademarks) is to \\"Promote progress.\\" By exchanging limited exclusive rights for disclosure of inventions and creative works, society and the patentee/copyright owner mutually benefit, and an incentive is created for inventors and authors to create and disclose their work. Some commentators have noted that the objective of intellectual property legislators and those who support its implementation appears to be \\"absolute protection\\". \\"If some intellectual property is desirable because it encourages innovation, they reason, more is better. The thinking is that creators will not have sufficient incentive to invent unless they are legally entitled to capture the full social value of their inventions\\". This absolute protection or full value view treats intellectual property as another type of \\"real\\" property, typically adopting its law and rhetoric.

When gibberellins are applied to plants by scientists, the stems grow longer. Some gardeners or horticulture scientists add gibberellins to increase the growth of plants. Dwarf plants (small plants), on the other hand, have low levels of gibberellins ( Figure below ). Another function of gibberellins is to stop dormancy (resting time) of seeds and buds. Gibberellins signal that it’s time for a seed to germinate (sprout) or for a bud to open.  I am facing a new situation today: Jeffrey is an avid grower of plants and he currently has some daisies and roses in his bedroom. Jeffrey's friend Robert gives Jeffrey a bottle of gibberellins one day and tells Jeffrey to pour some of the bottle onto the daisies. Jeffrey doesn't question this, because he is very trusting of his friend Robert, and pours the gibberellins onto the daisies, but not onto the roses.

It was acknowledgment rather than a greeting, delivered in a cool tone.\\", one might be tempted to interpret that it is Captain Bayliss who had a cool tone. However, it is important to properly analyze the context and meaning of the statement before confirming the hypothesis \\"Captain Bayliss had a cool tone\\" to be true. Before delving into the interpretation, let's first break down the sentence: 1. \\"Captain Bayliss.\\" - This phrase is referring to the subject of the sentence, Captain Bayliss. 2. \\"It was acknowledgment rather than a greeting,\\" - The sentence indicates that what is being expressed is a mere acknowledgment of Captain Bayliss's presence or actions instead of a warm or cordial greeting. 3. \\"delivered in a cool tone.\\" - This phrase specifies the manner in which the acknowledgment was delivered. From a comprehensive understanding of the statement, it can be deduced that the cool tone was attributed to the way the acknowledgment of Captain Bayliss was delivered. The sentence does not necessarily imply that Captain Bayliss themselves had a cool tone. Given this analysis, it would be incorrect to conclude that the hypothesis \\"Captain Bayliss had a cool tone\\" is true. Instead, a more accurate hypothesis based on the premise would be \\"The acknowledgment of Captain Bayliss was delivered in a cool tone.\\" This interpretation focuses on the delivery of the acknowledgment rather than attributing the cool tone to Captain Bayliss directly.  In conclusion, while it may be tempting to take the statement at face value and assume that Captain Bayliss had a cool tone, further analysis of the sentence reveals that the cool tone referred to the way the acknowledgment of Captain Bayliss was delivered, rather than to Captain Bayliss themselves. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that the hypothesis \\"Captain Bayliss had a cool tone\\" is true, and a more accurate hypothesis would be \\"The acknowledgment of Captain Bayliss was delivered in a cool tone.\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Two More Potential Snowmakers Ahead Meteorologist Domenica Davis looks at the forecast for two more potential snowmakers ahead.      At a Glance Winter Storm Riley bombed out off the New England coast and produced destructive impacts in the East March 1-4.      Coastal flooding and beach erosion occurred over multiple high tides, yielding the third-highest tide on record in Boston.      Damaging winds were reported from western New York and New England to the mountains of North Carolina, knocking out power to nearly 2 million.      Parts of New York state picked up 2 to 3 feet of snow, with one location receiving as much as 40 inches.      Riley first brought snow to the upper Midwest and Great Lakes Feb. 28-March 1.      Winter Storm Riley became an intense nor'easter after undergoing bombogenesis off the New England coast March 2-3, producing damaging winds and coastal flooding from New York and New England to North Carolina, following a quick burst of snow in the upper Midwest and Great Lakes Feb. 28-March 1.      (NEWS: At Least 9 Dead, 1.9 Million Without Power )      Riley developed in the Midwest on the last day of February, but it really took shape off the coast of New England March 2-3. The winter storm bombed out off the coast of Massachusetts, bringing near-record high tides to the state and feet of snow across the interior Northeast. This second monster winter storm of the season for the Northeast damaged seawalls and caused extreme beach erosion.      More than 1.9 million were reportedly without power from the mid-Atlantic to the Northeast by the morning of March 3.      High Winds      Low pressure just off the southern New England coast underwent explosive development known as bombogenesis , defined by a rapid drop in atmospheric pressure of at least 24 millibars in a period of 24 hours or less. From 7 p.m. EST March 1 to 4 p.m. EST March 2, the pressure dropped from 1000 millibars to 974 millibars, or a 26-millibar drop in only 21 hours.      Four different locations in Massachusetts reported winds gusts of 90 mph or more, including Barnstable (93 mph), East Falmouth (92 mph), Wellfleet (91 mph) and Nantucket (90 mph).      Wind gusts of 80 mph or greater were clocked in Scituate, Massachusetts, and at Little Compton, Rhode Island (83 mph).      Six states recorded wind gusts of at least 70 mph. Among those locations reporting 70-mph gusts or higher were Boston's Logan Airport (70 mph), Bayville, New York (78 mph), Cape May, New Jersey (71 mph), and Washington's Dulles Airport (71 mph).      Dulles Airport reported gusts over 50 mph for more than 12 hours straight, a rare occurrence , according to the National Weather Service.      In addition to all the wind damage and power outages, these high winds wreaked havoc for some flights into Washington D.C., including extreme turbulence on one flight to Dulles Airport and one aborted landing attempt at Reagan National Airport.      A section of the American Airlines hangar's roof at New York's LaGuardia Airport appeared to have been torn off by high winds, though the initial assessment showed the building was still structurally sound.      As of early March 3, 751 reports of wind damage had been received by local National Weather Service offices in 36 hours covering the duration of the storm.      The most numerous wind damage reports came in from Virginia (185 reports), Massachusetts (133 reports), then Maryland (108 reports), though wind damage was reported from Maine to North Carolina.      Avery County, North Carolina, 911 reported numerous trees downed across the county on the evening of March 1. A peak gust over 100 mph was clocked atop Grandfather Mountain , North Carolina, early March 2.      Winds were still gusting over 40 mph – mainly in southeastern New England, but also in a few other spots along the East Coast – by the morning of March 3.      Unfortunately, those gusts were still strong enough to trigger yet more wind damage in parts of southeastern Massachusetts.      Coastal Flooding      Water inundated parts of the Massachusetts coastline during the first high-tide cycle late-morning on March 2, and a second period of higher tide occurred late that night with moderate flooding observed.      Moderate flooding was observed at tide gauges in Scituate, Massachusetts, and Boston Harbor on the morning of March 2. The storm tide at Boston Harbor peaked at its third-highest level on record, only topped by Winter Storm Grayson in January and the Blizzard of '78.      The storm caused considerable damage in the coastal town of Scituate :      A car floating in floodwaters in Braintree, Massachusetts, prompted a water rescue.      These long-lived winds blowing over a long stretch of the ocean, piling onshore, led to additional minor coastal flooding along parts of the Northeast Seaboard through March 4 in some areas. Flood waters were very slow to recede between high-tide cycles.      Flooding at high tides through the morning of March 4 approached levels that typically produce widespread flooding of roads in Atlantic and Ocean counties , Ocean City and Somers Point , Wildwood Crest, Cape May and West Cape May, New Jersey , and Kent and Sussex counties, Delaware , according to the National Weather Service.      In the Outer Banks of North Carolina , oceanside and soundside flooding March 3-4 inundated stretches of Highway 12 near times of high tide.      Snow      Winter Storm Riley developed into a low-pressure system in the eastern Great Lakes on the morning on March 1, initially bringing snow to parts of Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio. The storm began to push into the interior Northeast late that day with heavy rain and moderate snow.      Snowfall rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour were observed across eastern Michigan on the afternoon of March 1. Ann Arbor, Michigan, picked up 3.1 inches of snow in only 2.5 hours early- to mid-afternoon March 1.      Riley's snow then kicked into high gear on the night of March 1 into March 2.      The town of Wyoming, New York, east of Buffalo, picked up a whopping 24 inches of snow in the 24 hours ending the morning of March 2. Thundersnow was observed in parts of western New York and northwestern Pennsylvania overnight March 1 into early March 2.      Richmondville, New York – in Schoharie County, west of Albany – led the pack with 40 inches of total snowfall. Sixteen other locations in New York state picked up at least two feet of snow, according to NOAA's storm summary .      <img class=\\"styles__noscript__2rw2y\\" src=\\"https://dsx.weather.com/util/image/w/riley-snow-nohrsc-3mar18.jpg?v=at&w=485&h=273&api=7db9fe61-7414-47b5-9871-e17d87b8b6a0\\" srcset=\\"https://dsx.weather.com/util/image/w/riley-snow-nohrsc-3mar18.jpg?v=at&w=485&h=273&api=7db9fe61-7414-47b5-9871-e17d87b8b6a0 400w, https://dsx.weather.com/util/image/w/riley-snow-nohrsc-3mar18.jpg?v=ap&w=980&h=551&api=7db9fe61-7414-47b5-9871-e17d87b8b6a0 800w\\" > 48-hour snowfall accumulation estimate ending Saturday, March 3, 2018 at 7 a.m. EST.

In this article, we will be discussing the importance of seeking help, wearing the right attire, proper measuring techniques, and recording accurate measurements. 1. Ask for Help It comes as no surprise that accurately measuring oneself can be a practically acrobatic task. This is where enlisting the assistance of a friend, family member, or even a professional tailor can prove invaluable. Having an extra pair of eyes and hands ensures that the measuring tape is held correctly, while also maintaining proper posture and positioning. This results in more accurate measurements, ultimately making the difference between a well-fitting shirt and one that's destined for the return pile. 2. Wear the Right Sort of Shirt The kind of shirt you wear during the measuring process plays a crucial role in determining the final fit. It's essential to wear a shirt that closely matches the desired fit of the new shirt you're shopping for. This will provide a more reliable basis for comparison and accurate measurements. In addition, make sure that the shirt you're wearing is not too tight, as this could skew the results. A well-fitting shirt should allow for comfortable breathing and movement, without appearing baggy or overly loose. 3. Measure Across the Front of Your Body Measuring across the front of your body is crucial when determining the perfect shirt fit. There are a few key measurements that need to be taken into consideration, including chest, waist, and hips. - Chest: To measure the chest, have your helper wrap the measuring tape around the widest part of your chest, typically just under the arms. Ensure that the tape is parallel to the floor and not too tight or loose. - Waist: The waist measurement is taken at the narrowest point of the torso, typically just above the navel. Once again, ensure that the tape is parallel to the floor and not too tight or loose. - Hips: For the hips, measure around the widest part, usually at the level of your hipbones. Maintain the tape parallel to the floor and keep it snug without cutting into the skin. 4. Write Down the Measurement Once all the measurements have been taken, it's essential to record them accurately. It's easy to forget these crucial numbers or mix them up, so make sure to jot them down immediately. Having a documented record of your measurements is not only helpful when shopping for shirts but can also come in handy when purchasing other clothing items. Remember to update these measurements periodically, as our bodies tend to change over time. Conclusion Obtaining accurate shirt measurements can make all the difference in finding clothing that fits and flatters. By asking for help, wearing the right sort of shirt, measuring across the front of your body, and writing down the measurements, you can confidently navigate the world of shirt shopping and ensure that you always look and feel your best. Say goodbye to ill-fitting clothes and hello to a wardrobe that fits like a glove!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Pharmacoresistance is a common problem hindering treatment of epilepsy. A possible cause for this resistance is the overexpression of efflux drug transporters, e.g. P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which may decrease extracellular antiepileptic drugs levels in brains of intractable epilepsy patients. Another transmembrane drug transporter is the organic anion transporting polypeptide 2 (Oatp2), which is colocalized with P-gp in many polarized tissues. However, a role for Oatp2 in the development of multidrug resistance has not been established. In the present work, we investigated the expression of drug transporters Oatp2 and P-gp in brain, liver and kidney of rats with chronic epilepsy induced by lithium-pilocarpine.', 'Chronic epilepsy was elicited after status epilepticus (SE) induced by lithium-pilocarpine in adult Wistar rats. Following SE, expression of Oatp2 and P-gp protein was detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis and messenger RNA (mRNA) using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Levels of the drug transporters were compared in brain, liver and kidney of chronic epileptic and control rats.', 'Both Oatp2 and P-gp were expressed in the brain, liver and kidney but predominantly in the brain. In the brain, Oatp2 and P-gp immunopositive cells were observed in brain capillary endothelium and choroid plexus epithelium. Compared with control rats, Oatp2 protein expression in brain was significantly decreased, while P-gp was obviously increased in chronic epileptic rats. P-gp mRNA was also significantly higher in brains of chronic epileptic rats, whereas the expression of Oatp2 did not change. Organic anion transporting polypeptide 2 and P-gp did not change at the mRNA or protein level with epilepsy in the liver or kidney. Output:","output":"Based on the passage, what is the difference in protein expression of Oatp2 and P-gp in the brains of chronic epileptic rats compared to control rats?"},{"instruction":"I had something that might have been a little supernatural. So I was trying to sleep one time, and I sleep under the blankets 99% of the time. I sleep downstairs, so hearing noise is pretty normal. Also, my door doesn’t lock, or even latch the door handle, so you can just push it open. So I was laying down, maybe at 60% in terms of how close I was to falling asleep, so I just had to lay down for like 5 more minutes. But there are a lot of noises, and they freak me out even though I just sorta pretend that they’re definitely a cat or my dog or something. So, I’m already slightly spooked, but I’m ignoring it and going to sleep anyway. But then, I hear my door open. That isn’t too weird, I do have cats, so even though by this point my fear is intense, I just sorta blow it off and keep trying to sleep. And then, something that’s never happened in a situation like this, I feel something moving towards me on my bed. It feels like a cats movements, with light feet making slight reverberations on the bed. So my fear goes away entirely, and I’m like “Oh okay, it’s just the cat, that’s good.” And I lift my blankets off my head to let my cat under with me, and because the fear seemed to make the atmosphere under there very hot and tense, and then I look at my bed and there’s nothing. So I just pretend nothing happened and go to sleep, but that still sticks with me and even though it’s kinda underwhelming I still think it was very strange since I wasn’t at the “edge of consciousness” stage of going to sleep, so I feel like the chances I imagined it aren’t too high.

When I had trouble bending over to tie my shoes and I wasn’t pregnant. When I hit about 35 I started having trouble with weight. The strange thing was to me, it wasn’t that I was eating more then I used to, as a matter of fact I started eating less. When that didn’t help I barely ate at all. Still I couldn’t lose weight. What I didn’t know was we start to lose muscle mass every decade beginning in our thirties, and I was a ripe 35. Muscles use up more calories than fat, so less muscle means a slower metabolism and the need for fewer calories, and the pounds stack on easier. My second problem was my narcolepsy. When you wake up after a nights sleep there is a release of adrenaline which prompts body and mind into action and helps burn off calories. Narcolepsy causes me to sleep on and off during the day, and as explained by my doctor (so if I have this wrong about adrenaline it is my doctors fault lol) I am not getting that adrenaline release because my bodies clock doesn’t know if I am asleep or awake. He suggested in the morning to start exercising about 20 minutes to get that adrenaline rush, in the afternoon exercise about twenty minutes more for the same reason… Dieting and exercising brought those pounds back down. I will say it is much harder in the winter for me then in the summer. Summer time I am naturally active. I ride bikes with my husband, swim, garden, mow about an acre of lawn.

Movie title: Bashu, the Little Stranger Movie plot: The film is about a young boy from Khuzestan province, in the south of Iran, during the IranâIraq War. His parents are killed in a bombing raid on his home village and he escapes on a cargo truck to the north. Eventually he gets off and finds refuge on the farm of a Gilak woman, Na'i, who has two young children of her own. Initially, Na'i tries to shoo Bashu away, but later takes pity on him and leaves food out for him. Although Na'i is initially ambivalent toward Bashu, and he is initially suspicious of her, they come to trust one another, and Bashu becomes a member of the family, even calling Na'i \\"mom\\". Being that Bashu speaks Arabic, while Na'i and her children speak Gilaki, they have trouble communicating with each other, although Bashu is able to speak and read Persian (for example in the scene where he picks up the school textbook, reading a passage from it in an attempt to appease the children fighting). In a gesture of reciprocation and perhaps love, Bashu cares for Na'i when she falls ill, as she had done for him, crying for her and beating a drum in prayer. Throughout the film, Na'i maintains correspondence with her husband, a war veteran looking for employment, who has been gone for quite some time. She tells him about Bashu, and implores him to return home in time to help with the harvest. Bashu becomes Na'i's helper on the farm, and even accompanies her to the bazaar to sell her goods. Throughout the film, Bashu sees visions of his dead family members, which cause him to wander off. Ultimately, however, he and Na'i are always reunited. The other adults in the village harangue Na'i about taking Bashu in, often deriding his dark skin and different language, and making comments about washing the dark off of his skin. In addition to the village adults, the school age children taunt and beat Bashu, although the children prove ultimately to be more willing to accept Bashu than the adults.

Thankfully, science is now providing new clues to help us reduce snacking. Make friends with dainty  eaters. Studies have found that people tend to increase or reduce the amount of food they eat depending on what their companions are taking in. See happy movies... and always get the smaller bag of popcorn . According to some experts, people eat up to 29% more popcorn if they are watching a sad or serious movie, compared to when they are watching a comedy.

Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.  - A teen drama is a genre or type of drama series with a major focus on teenage characters.

Named after the Angles, one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to England, it ultimately derives its name from the Anglia (Angeln) peninsula in the Baltic Sea. It is most closely related to the Frisian languages, although its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages in the early medieval period, and later by Romance languages, particularly French. English is either the official language or one of the official languages in almost 60 sovereign states. It is the most commonly spoken language in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland, and New Zealand, and is widely spoken in some areas of the Caribbean, Africa, and South Asia. It is the third most common native language in the world, after Mandarin and Spanish. It is the most widely learned second language and an official language of the United Nations, of the European Union, and of many other world and regional international organisations. It is the most widely spoken Germanic language, accounting for at least 70% of speakers of this Indo-European branch.  - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean.

A woman enters a small café. The scene looks ordinary, but the counterman, customers, and two musicians seem somehow oddly subdued. Suddenly, the musicians play and one man begins to sing the title song , dancing across table tops with musical-comedy gestures. The customers, at first immobile, at intervals chime in (badly but gamely) with phrases from the song, read from slips of paper in their palms. On and off they jump up and dance (awkwardly but earnestly) in choreographed motions, like backup singers. But why??? the woman wonders. The answer is revealed as the soloist's jacket opens and she sees what's strapped across his chest -- just before the explosive climax...

A urinary tract infection (uti) is very common but can be unpleasant and very uncomfortable. Utis are an infection of your upper urinary tract (kidney and ureters), lower urinary tract (bladder and urethra), or both.","output":"If you suspect you have a urinary tract infection (UTI), it's crucial to act quickly to minimize complications and discomfort. Here's a comprehensive guide on how to alleviate a UTI fast. 1. Consult a healthcare professional: If you suspect you are experiencing the symptoms of a UTI (burning sensation when urinating, frequent urination, cloudy or strong-smelling urine, discomfort in the lower abdomen), it is essential to consult your doctor or other healthcare professional. They will be able to perform a urine test and recommend appropriate treatment based on the severity of your UTI. 2. Take prescribed antibiotics: UTIs are commonly caused by bacteria like E. coli, and your healthcare provider will prescribe an antibiotic to combat the infection. Make sure to follow your prescribed dosage and complete the full course of treatment, even if you start feeling better before it's finished. This is crucial for avoiding antibiotic resistance and preventing the infection from returning. 3. Hydrate with water: Drinking plenty of water helps dilute your urine and flush out bacteria from your urinary system. Aim to drink at least 8-10 glasses of water every day and avoid caffeine, alcohol, and sugary beverages, as these can exacerbate UTI symptoms. 4. Use pain relief: Over-the-counter pain relief medication, such as ibuprofen, aspirin, or naproxen, can help alleviate the pain and discomfort associated with a UTI. Be sure to follow the instructions on the packaging and consult your healthcare provider if you have any medical conditions or are taking other medications. 5. Apply heat: Applying heat to your lower abdomen can help alleviate UTI-related discomfort. Use a heating pad or warm compress on the affected area for 15-20 minutes several times a day, making sure the heat is not too intense to avoid burns or skin irritation. 6. Avoid irritants: Harsh soaps, bubble baths, and other products with potentially irritating chemicals can further aggravate your urinary tract. Opt for unscented and hypoallergenic products during this time to minimize irritation. 7. Take over-the-counter UTI relief medications: Some over-the-counter medications, such as Azo (phenazopyridine), can help relieve UTI symptoms like burning and urgency. However, they only provide temporary relief and do not cure the infection. Always consult your healthcare provider before using these medications. 8. Practice good hygiene: Always wipe from front to back after using the toilet to prevent the spread of bacteria and take showers instead of baths. Change underwear daily and choose cotton fabric, which is more breathable, to promote a healthier environment for your urinary tract. 9. Modify your diet: Foods and drinks high in vitamin C can help boost your immune system and make your urine more acidic, which may hinder bacterial growth. Incorporate citrus fruits, berries, leafy greens, and bell peppers into your diet and avoid bladder irritants like caffeine and spicy foods. 10. Follow-up with your healthcare provider: Once you start taking antibiotics, your UTI symptoms should start improving within two to three days. However, if your symptoms worsen or do not improve, it's essential to consult your healthcare provider for further evaluation and management. Keep in mind that while these steps can help alleviate UTI symptoms, it's crucial to complete the antibiotic course as prescribed and maintain communication with your healthcare provider. UTIs left untreated or improperly treated can lead to more serious complications, including kidney infections and damage. It's also important to note that antibiotic-resistant UTIs are becoming increasingly common, so preventing UTIs through proper hygiene and self-care is essential."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write some highlights for the following article: (CNN)  -- Thierry Henry could face FIFA disciplinary action over his handball which helped France to qualify for the finals of the 2010 World Cup at the expense of Ireland. FIFA president Sepp Blatter told reporters in Cape Town that the Barcelona striker's \\"blatant unfair play\\" could land him in hot water. \\"The FIFA disciplinary committee will open an investigation ... concerning the behavior of the player Thierry Henry,\\" he said. \\"It was blatant unfair play and was seen all around the world. I don't know the outcome of the disciplinary committee, let them make the decision. \\"Fair play must be maintained in our game.\\" Blatter was speaking after an extraordinary meeting of the FIFA executive committee, which was convened to consider the refereeing controversy in the France - Ireland match, incidents surrounding the Algeria - Egypt playoff tie and matchfixing in Europe. It had been widely trailed that the FIFA executive would sanction the use of two extra officials behind both goal lines in World Cup. But Blatter said that the finals in South Africa was too soon to introduce the system which has been used in the second-tier European club tournament this year. \\"The experiments with the Europa League shall go on into the knockout stages next year but it has been decided, for the World Cup 2010, there is no change in the refereeing: one referee, two assistants and a fourth official.\\" He went on to say that there would be further investigation into both video technology and additional referees. \\"We shall have a look at technology or additional persons and this shall be done by a committee but not the referees committee alone, it will be done by the football, technical and medical committees, too,\\" he added. Ireland were denied a place in the finals by a goal that should have been disallowed because Henry used his hand to control the ball before setting up William Gallas to score the aggregate decider in the second leg in the Stade de France. Ireland subsequently launched two appeals, the first for the match to be replayed, the second for them to be added to the line-up for the finals as the 33rd team. Both have been rejected, but Blatter was forced to apologize to the Irish for making public their supposedly private bid to be included as an extra team. Blatter put their request into the public domain in light-hearted comments made in Johannesburg, which left Irish football officials infuriated and insulted. \\"I would like to express my regrets for the wrong interpretation of what I said. I regret what I have created and I'm sorry to the Ireland football confederation for these headlines going around the world,\\" he said. \\"It's a pity I communicated in this way. Sorry again.\\"","output":"In a soccer game, a player named Thierry Henry used his hand to help his team, France, win a match and qualify for the 2010 World Cup.

Given the question: As people in Beijing and northern China struggle with severe air pollution this winter,the toxic air is also making life hard for plants and even food crops of China. \\"in the last 50 years there has been a 1 6-fold increase in ozone pollution\\"in the Beijing area,said Hanqin Tian of Auburn University in Alabama,who studies the effects of China's pollution and climate change on plants. Ozone is particularly harmful to plants because it damages the pores   on leaves,called stomata,which plants use to regulate how much water evaporates from the leaves.That,in turn,affectS how much water a plant must take up through its roots.Changes in water uptake by plants have been documented in other parts of the world,including the United States,as having major impacts on regional groundwater and surface water supplies. In studies of the long-term productivity of plants,Hanqin Tian and some of his colleagues show that ozone pollution,along with climate change,has been lowering plant productivity in China,which reduces the amount of carbon and other pollutants that the plants Can absorb to fight all the emissions from the burning offossil fuels. The worst effects on plants are likely to be in areas where the growing pollution problem is just fairly new, said Arthur Chappelka, also a plant researcher at Auburn University.Some plants are more resistant to pollutants than others,he said,and the plants that are living today in long-polluted urban areas are likely to be only those that are very pollution tolerant. Away from the cities, however, where crops are necded to feed China's yast population, the effeets of the growing pollution on crops is a significant concern. \\"In some ways it affects the crop production and food securiy of China,\\"said Hanqin Tian.\\"Air quality is really important for human health, plants and ecosystem and sustainability.\\" The problem is bound to get worse as China continues to develop economically, he said, and so he and other researchers continue to urge the Chinese government to take action to reduce...

Choices:  - orchard - conservation land - countryside - yard - surface of earth  The rationale to choose \\"yard\\" as the answer is that:","output":"\\"Yard\\" is the most appropriate answer among the given choices because it directly relates to the area surrounding or adjacent to a house, where trees are commonly planted for various reasons such as landscaping, shade, or fruit production. Yards are an essential part of residential properties and are typically tailored based on the homeowner's preferences, including the presence of trees. Let's quickly analyze the other choices to understand why \\"Yard\\" is the best option: 1. Orchard: While orchards do have trees, they are usually specifically designated for growing fruit trees in agriculture or commercial production. They are not typically found in immediate proximity to houses within most towns. 2. Conservation land: These are protected areas designated for conserving wildlife, ecosystems, and natural resources. Though trees are found in conservation lands, they are not usually located directly adjacent to houses in towns. 3. Countryside: The term \\"countryside\\" refers to a rural area where you might find trees surrounding houses, but it is a more general term that encompasses the entire rural landscape instead of specifically describing trees near houses in towns. 4. Surface of Earth: This is the planet's physical exterior, which comprises a wide variety of geographic locations, including urban and rural areas, bodies of water, and natural formations. While it's true that trees can be found on the Earth's surface, this term is too broad and not specific enough to illustrate trees near houses within towns. In conclusion, the term \\"yard\\" best describes where in a town you would see trees near houses, as it is a more specific term and directly relates to residential areas where houses and trees can commonly be found together."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They would think about the words and the way they are put together when they read this sentence.  Now, if we talk about these words in order, \\"The old dog\\" is totally fine because we're talking about a dog that is old.  Next is the word \\"died,\\" which means the poor old dog is no longer alive. So far, the sentence is making sense. But when we add the word \\"partway,\\" it gets a little tricky. You see, \\"partway\\" means being in the middle of doing something or going somewhere. But when a living thing, like a dog, dies, it either is alive or it isn't—there's no in-between.  So, a linguist might say the sentence is a bit confusing or not making much sense, even though the words are put together in the right way.

No The sentence \\"To illustrate the depth of an anthropological approach, one can take just one of these topics, such as \\"racism\\" and find thousands of anthropological references, stretching across all the major and minor sub-fields,\\" does not provide a valid answer to the question \\"What are good topics to attract the attention of an anthropologist?\\". The given sentence demonstrates the depth and breadth of anthropological studies in relation to a single topic, such as racism. However, it does not provide a list of specific topics that are likely to attract the interest of an anthropologist. To answer the question more directly, a detailed and long answer... Anthropology is a diverse and broad field of study that involves understanding human societies and cultures. Anthropologists engage in topics that range from the origins of the human species to contemporary global issues. Good topics that can attract the attention of an anthropologist may be found in various sub-fields of anthropology, including cultural anthropology, linguistic anthropology, physical (biological) anthropology, and archaeology. Some topics that are likely to pique the interest of an anthropologist include: 1. Culture and Society: Anthropologists might study cultural norms, beliefs, values, and practices among various societies to better understand the human experience. Topics range from social organization, political and economic systems, to religion and rituals. 2. Race and Ethnicity: Understanding socially constructed racial categorizations and their implications on individuals and societies at large is an essential aspect of anthropology. Researchers might explore topics such as stereotypes, discrimination, and the social dynamics of identity formation among different ethnic groups. 3. Gender and Sexuality: The roles, expectations, and relationships related to gender and sexuality are salient topics for anthropologists, as they often reveal cultural standards and can promote social change. Researchers may examine gender roles, sexuality, and LGBTQ+ rights across cultures and historical contexts. 4. Migration and Displacement: Various reasons can compel individuals or entire communities to migrate—whether voluntarily or involuntarily—which can lead to significant social, cultural, and political changes. Anthropologists might investigate topics such as refugee experiences, diaspora communities, and the impact of migration on both the host and origin societies. 5. Language and Communication: Linguistic anthropology focuses on the role of language in shaping human societies. Topics of investigation can include linguistic diversity, the relationship between language and culture, and the evolution of language over time. 6. Human Evolution and Biological Variation: Physical anthropology involves studying the biological aspects of humans and their evolution. By examining human adaptations, genetics, and ancestry, researchers can explore topics such as primatology, paleoanthropology, and human variation, all while aiming to illuminate the broader story of human history. 7. Archaeology: This sub-field focuses on the study of past cultures through the excavation of material remains and environmental data. Topics can include ancient civilizations, the rise and fall of empires, or changes in technology and societal structures. These topics represent just a small portion of the vast scope of anthropological interests. Anthropologists are not only attracted to these complex issues, but they often bring their unique interdisciplinary perspectives in the hope of better understanding the human experience, as well as promoting positive social change."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose your answer: If \\"A man on a bicycle with an umbrella getting his picture taken.\\", does it logically follow that \\"The man is attempting to wrestle a live alligator in a zoo in FL.\\"? Possible answers: [-] yes. [-] it is not possible to tell. [-] no.","output":"The correct answer to the question would be \\"no.\\" These two statements involve completely different scenarios and do not logically connect. In the first statement, we are given a picture of a man riding a bicycle while carrying an umbrella and having his picture taken. This suggests a routine, peaceful setting, maybe an urban environment or a park. He's maintaining balance on his bike while holding onto his umbrella, possibly indicating that it's raining or just about to, and someone finds this scene interesting enough to take a picture. This could be an everyday activity or maybe a candid moment captured through the lens of the camera. On the other hand, the second statement – about a man attempting to wrestle a live alligator in a zoo in Florida – presents an extraordinary and risky scenario. Alligator wrestling is a rather dangerous activity, and it is far from the calm tableau of a man riding his bike with an umbrella. Furthermore, it implies that this man is in direct interaction with a wild and potentially aggressive creature in a zoo, which would be considered abnormal and hazardous behavior. There is no logical connection or linkage that would allow us to reasonably conclude, from the information given in the first statement, that the same man is also trying to wrestle an alligator at a zoo in Florida. Consequently, the two situations are disjointed and refer to different contexts and actions. The information provided in the first statement does not in any way imply the occurrence of the events in the second statement. While it could be possible that the same person is involved in both activities at different points, the information given does not lead us to infer this. Moreover, as extreme and unusual as alligator wrestling can be, it is unlikely that a person who is photographed in an ordinary scenario like biking with an umbrella would be immediately associated with such an incredibly adventurous and uncommon activity. So, in strict logical terms, the detail about the man on a bicycle with an umbrella getting his picture taken does not lead to the assumption that he is trying to wrestle a live alligator in a zoo in Florida. They are independent scenarios with no obvious connection. Thus, the logical answer, based on the information given in the statements, would be \\"no.\\" The first situation does not imply the second."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On the season finale, Arnold and Klein learned their surrogate was expecting. \\"After we got pregnant, the craziness ensued with us wondering what to do with the baby's room, making sure our surrogate was getting her daily dose of baby vitamins,\\" Klein tells PEOPLE. But since filming their happy visit to the doctor, the couple's surrogate lost the pregnancy. Klein had to contact his wife, a neonatologist at Texas Children's Hospital, while she was at work in order to tell her the heartbreaking news. \\"I didn't want her to be the last person to find out,\\" he says. \\"Ugly or happy, it needs to be told. It was a very tough day, and Jen took it harder than she originally expected.\\" \\"I cried my eyes out,\\" Arnold tells PEOPLE. \\"I deal with families who lose their babies and I will cry with them, but I thought I would be stronger. Nothing can completely prepare for all that when it is about you.\\" When the couple were able to get together at the end of the day, they mourned, crying and comforting one another and later talking to family and friends. The next day they decided they would continue trying to start a family, with both surrogacy and adoption as possible paths. Kim Kardashian's Marriage: Mistake or Fake? \\"Bill was a rock, and he held me through everything,\\" Arnold says. \\"By the next morning, I realized that I needed to try again. We were so close and so pregnant with the ultrasound looking good, and so it was horrible for it to end. But I couldn't have said I was done. A lot of family asked, 'Do you want to go through this again?' And my answer is, yes. I would be miserable if I didn't try again.\\" A Rocky Road. Because both Klein and Arnold carry a single gene for their type of skeletal dysplasia, there is a chance they could both pass the gene on to their child, which could be lethal for their baby. To avoid this, embryos are genetically tested before implantation. If no skeletal dysplasia genes are passed on, the baby would be healthy and average sized; if one gene is passed, the baby would be a healthy little person. Also, Jen is on medication to stimulate her ovaries, which produced only half as many eggs as expected. \\"We appreciated all the prayers and positive thinking,\\" says Arnold of sharing her difficult story with the world. \\"That is comforting and is giving us strength. When we lost the pregnancy, we wondered how we were going to handle it. But by sharing our story, whether it be positive or negative, I think it can help others going through similar things.\\" Ultimately, becoming parents is what means the most. \\"We are so in love with each other and supportive of each other that we are going to be okay,\\" she says. \\"We really want to be parents, and that is the goal here through surrogacy and adoption. We are not done trying yet.\\" Kris Jenner: 'People Have to Stop Judging' Kim for Ending Her Marriage. Until that day comes, Klein cherishes life with his wife. \\"I could go the next 50 or 100 years with just the two of us, because we have a great relationship,\\" he says. \\"Few people are so lucky to have that from the moment you meet that one person, and everything we add to our relationship is exciting.\\" Challenges -- both past and future -- will only make their bond stronger. \\"We really just feel crazy fortunate to have found each other,\\" Arnold says. \\"We were both at a point of giving up. Being a little person, everything is a struggle, and it is wonderful when you achieve something you really wanted. You don't let that go so easily.\\" See full article at PEOPLE.com. © 2011 People and Time Inc. All rights reserved.

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Raising the temperature of a chemical reaction usually results in a higher rate of reaction. When the reactant particles are heated, they move faster and faster. This results in a greater frequency of collisions. A more important effect of the temperature increase is that the collisions occur with a greater force and are thus more likely to surmount the activation energy barrier and go on to form products. Increasing the temperature of a reaction increases the number of effective collisions between reacting particles, so the reaction rate increases.  I am facing a new situation today: Two colleagues read about types of chemical reactions. Sean studied about the influence of temperature on chemical reactions. Gabe studied about other influencing factors.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which student read less about the activation energy barrier? Answer:","output":"Considering the information provided in the background article and the new situation, Sean read about the influence of temperature on chemical reactions, which directly discussed the activation energy barrier and how increasing temperature affects it. On the other hand, Gabe studied other influencing factors, which may or may not have included the activation energy barrier. Based on what we know, Gabe is more likely to have read less about the activation energy barrier than Sean, as Sean's topic specifically mentioned and explained the concept, while Gabe's study was more broadly focused on other factors that might influence chemical reactions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

ANA will introduce one female-only toilet per aircraft on international flights next month after a survey of women fliers identified  it was the second most attractive service they wished for after being offered desserts. The rest of the toilets onboard will be for men and women as usual. \\"We received many comments that having a women-only lavatory would be a factor in differentiating our airline from others,\\" said an NAN spokesman. \\"Many women said that they feel uncomfortable taking their time in the lavatory knowing that a male is waiting just behind them in line,\\" he said. The spokesman denied that the new service was introduced following complaints about men soiling  the bathrooms, telling reporters: \\"Those opinions may exist, but we do not have that data on hand\\". Since 2006 ANA has pursued   a one - month awareness campaign each year in which it asks fliers on 38 flights and four international flights to visit the bathroom before boarding to reduce their body weight and therefore cut he plane's carbon-dioxide emissions.

Most EU states are part of this organisation and therefore EBU has been subject to supranational legislation and regulation. It also hosted debates between candidates for the European Commission presidency for the 2014 parliamentary elections but is unrelated to the institution itself.

EBU is a member of the International Music Council.  - The Eurovision Song Contest, sometimes popularly called Eurovision but not to be confused with the Eurovision network that broadcasts it, is the longest-running annual international TV song competition, held, primarily, among the member countries of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) since 1956. The competition was based upon the existing Sanremo Music Festival held in Italy since 1951.  - Aleksandra and Konstantin a Belarusian is the musical duo of singer Aleksandra Kirsanova and guitarist Konstantin Drapezo .

Fact 2: Plants are producers are consumers are omnivores .

Explanation: The two given facts are as follows: Fact 1: Many consumers feed at more than one trophic level. Fact 2: Plants are producers are consumers are omnivores. Trophic levels are the hierarchical levels in a food chain where organisms are grouped according to their feeding behaviors. The main trophic levels include producers, primary consumers (herbivores), secondary consumers (carnivores), and tertiary consumers (carnivores that eat other carnivores). From the given facts, we can understand that many consumers feed at more than one trophic level, meaning they consume organisms from different trophic levels. Omnivores are consumers that eat both plants and animals, so they can feed at more than one trophic level, making them part of the answer. Humans are also part of the answer, as they are omnivores by nature, consuming a diverse range of foods that include plants, animals, and other organisms such as fungi. Chickens are categorized as omnivores as well, even though they are primarily considered as domesticated birds. In the wild or when allowed to forage freely, chickens will eat plants, seeds, insects, small animals, and even small reptiles. So, chickens can also feed at more than one trophic level. Lastly, animals, as a broad category, can encompass various organisms that feed at more than one trophic level, including omnivores, certain birds, and even some fish species. The other options – all carnivores, producers, people, and grass – don't fit the criteria of feeding at more than one trophic level. Producers (such as plants and algae) create their own energy through photosynthesis, grass is a producer, and all carnivores only feed on other animals.

Tabor and his wife, Elizabeth McCourt, better known as \\"Baby Doe\\". Their history is fast becoming one of the legends of the Old West. Horace Austin Warner Tabor was a school teacher in Vermont. Then he moved west to the small Colorado mining camp known as California Gulch, which he later renamed Leadville when he became its leading citizen. \\"Great deposits of lead are sure to be found here.\\" he said. As it turned out, it was silver, not lead, that was to make Leadville's fortune and wealth. Tabor knew little about mining himself, so he opened a general store, which sold everything from boots to salt, flour, and tobacco. It was his custom to \\" _ \\" prospective miners, in other words, to supply them with food and supplies, or \\"grub\\", while they looked for ore , in return for which he would get a share in the mine if one was discovered. He did this for a number of years, but no one that he aided ever found anything of value. Finally one day in the year 1878, so the story goes, two miners came in and asked for \\"grub\\". Tabor had decided to quit supplying it because he had lost too much money that way. These were persistent, however, and Tabor was too busy to argue with them. \\"Oh help yourself. One more time won't make any difference,\\" He said and went on selling shoes and hats to other customers. The two miners took 17 worth of supplies, in return for which they gave Tabor a one-third interest in their findings. They picked a barren place on the mountain side and began to dig. After nine days they struck a rich vein of silver. Tabor bought the shares of the other two men, and so the mine belonged to him alone. This mine, known as the \\"Pittsburgh Mine,\\" made 1,300,000 for Tabor in return for his 17 investment. Later Tabor bought the Matchless Mine on another barren hillside just outside the town for 117,000. This turned out to be even more fabulous than the Pittsburgh, yielding 35,000 worth of silver per day at one time. Leadville grew....

The town is known as the birthplace of the philosopher and poet Gotthold Ephraim Lessing.  - Rolf Huisgen (born 13 June 1920) is a German chemist. He was born in Gerolstein in the Rhineland-Palatinate and studied in Munich under the supervision of Heinrich Otto Wieland. After completing his Ph.D. in 1943 and his habilitation in 1947, he was named professor at the University of Tübingen in 1949. He returned to the University of Munich in 1952 where he remained dedicated to research long after attaining emeritus status in 1988.  - In organic chemistry, functional groups are specific groups (moieties) of atoms or bonds within molecules that are responsible for the characteristic chemical reactions of those molecules. The same functional group will undergo the same or similar chemical reaction(s) regardless of the size of the molecule it is a part of. However, its relative reactivity can be modified by other functional groups nearby. The atoms of functional groups are linked to each other and to the rest of the molecule by covalent bonds. Any subgroup of atoms of a compound also may be called a radical, and if a covalent bond is broken homolytically, the resulting fragment radicals are referred as free radicals. Functional groups can also be charged, e.g. in carboxylate salts (-COO), which turns the molecule into a polyatomic ion or a complex ion.  - The Steglich esterification is a variation of an esterfication with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide as a coupling reagent and 4 - dimethylaminopyridine as a catalyst . The reaction was first described by Wolfgang Steglich in 1978 . It is an adaptation of an older method for the formation of amides by means of DCC ( dicyclohexylcarbodiimide ) and 1 - hydroxybenzotriazole ( HOBT ) . This reaction generally takes place at room temperature . A suitable solvent is dichloromethane . Because the reaction is mild , esters can be obtained that are inaccessible through other methods for instance esters of the sensitive 1,4 - dihydroxybenzoic acid . A characteristic is the formal uptake of water generated in the reaction by DCC , forming the urea compound dicyclohexylurea ( DCU ) .  - The connectivity of a molecule often has a strong influence on its physical and chemical properties and behavior. Two molecules composed of the same numbers of the same types of atoms (i.e. a pair of isomers) might have completely different chemical and/or physical properties if the atoms are connected differently or in different positions. In such cases, a structural formula is useful, as it illustrates which atoms are bonded to which other ones. From the connectivity, it is often possible to deduce the approximate shape of the molecule.  - Habilitation is a post-doctoral qualification or academic degree at some European and Central Asian, North African, and Latin American universities. It is conferred for a habilitation thesis based on independent scholarship, which was reviewed by and successfully defended before an academic committee in a process similar to that of a doctoral dissertation. In some countries, a habilitation degree is a required formal qualification to independently teach and examine a designated subject at the university level.  - An amide (or or ), also known as an acid amide, is a compound with the functional group RE(O)NR (R and R refer to H or organic groups). Most common are carboxamides (organic amides) (\\"n\\" = 1, E = C, \\"x\\" = 1), but many other important types of amides are known, including phosphoramides (\\"n\\" = 2, E = P, \\"x\\" = 1 and many related formulas) and sulfonamides (E = S, \\"x\\" = 2). The term amide refers both to \\"classes of compounds\\" and to the \\"functional group\\" (RE(O)NR) within those compounds.  - The University of Bonn is a public research university located in Bonn, Germany. Founded in its present form in 1818, as the linear successor of earlier academic institutions, the University of Bonn is today one of the leading universities in Germany. The University of Bonn offers a large number of undergraduate and graduate programs in a range of subjects. Its library holds more than five million volumes. The University of Bonn has 544 professors and 32,500 students. Among its notable alumni and faculty are seven Nobel Laureates, three Fields Medalist, twelve Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize winners, Prince Albert, Pope Benedict XVI, Frederick III, Karl Marx, Heinrich Heine, Friedrich Nietzsche, Konrad Adenauer, and Joseph Schumpeter. The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2016 and the Academic Ranking of World Universities 2015 ranked the University of Bonn as one of the 100 best universities in the world.  - Life. Wolfgang Steglich was born in Kamenz and studied chemistry at the Technical University of Berlin and later at the Technical University of Munich where he received his PhD in 1959 for work with Friedrich Weygand. After his habilitation at the Technical University of Munich he became professor at the Technical University of Munich in 1969 where he stayed until he became professor at the University of Bonn in 1975. He succeeded Rolf Huisgen as head of the organic chemistry department of the University of Munich in 1991. He retired in 2001.  - The Technical University of Munich (TUM) is a research university with campuses in Munich, Garching and Freising-Weihenstephan. It is a member of TU9, an incorporated society of the largest and most notable German institutes of technology.  - Pyridine is a basic heterocyclic organic compound with the chemical formula CHN. It is structurally related to benzene, with one methine group (=CH) replaced by a nitrogen atom. The pyridine ring occurs in many important compounds, including azines and the vitamins niacin and pyridoxine.  - 4-Dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) is a derivative of pyridine with the chemical formula (CH)NCHN. This colourless solid is of interest because it is more basic than pyridine, owing to the resonance stabilisation from the NMe substituent.  - The Technische Universität Berlin, known as TU Berlin and unofficially as the Technical University of Berlin, is a research university located in Berlin, Germany. It was founded in 1879 and became one of the most prestigious education institutions in Europe.

Question: I read this background article the other day: The two adrenal glands are located above the kidneys. Each gland has an inner and outer part. The outer part, called the cortex, secretes hormones such as cortisol, which helps the body deal with stress, and aldosterone, which helps regulate the balance of minerals in the body. The inner part of each adrenal gland, called the medulla, secretes fight-or-flight hormones such as adrenaline, which prepare the body to respond to emergencies. For example, adrenaline increases the amount of oxygen and glucose going to the muscles. You can see an animation of this response at the link below.  I am facing a new situation today: John is a biologist, who studies animal species of tundra biome. He noticed that they behave in certain way when they secrete hormones from adrenal glands' cortex. On the other hand, they behave some other way when they secrete hormones from adrenal glands' medulla. He termed the first process as process A and latter process as process B.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which process may not help the species during emergencies, process A or process B? Answer:","output":"To answer the question correctly, let's break down the information step by step: Step 1: Understand the functions of the adrenal glands' cortex and medulla. - Cortex: Secretes hormones such as cortisol (helps deal with stress) and aldosterone (regulates mineral balance). - Medulla: Secretes fight-or-flight hormones such as adrenaline, which prepares the body to respond to emergencies by increasing oxygen and glucose supply to muscles. Step 2: Define the processes observed by John. - Process A: Animal behavior when hormones from the adrenal glands' cortex are secreted. - Process B: Animal behavior when hormones from the adrenal glands' medulla are secreted. Step 3: Determine which process may not be helpful during emergencies. - Process A involves the secretion of hormones that regulate stress and mineral balance, which although important, may not be directly associated with an immediate emergency response. - Process B involves the secretion of fight-or-flight hormones (adrenaline) that specifically prepare the body to respond to emergencies. Based on this analysis, the correct answer is that process A may not help the species during emergencies as compared to process B, which is directly linked to the fight-or-flight response of the body during emergencies."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"So\\" Answer:","output":"1"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If they are not working, they are jogging, or playing tennis or golf, or taking courses to improve their minds or bodies -or they are parked in front of the TV. Sitting in front of the TV isn't sitting - it's watching. People used to sit a lot. You would walk down the street or drive down the road, and there they would be, out on the doorsteps, sitting. You could go down to the store and sit on the bench out front in the summer or around the fire in the winter. There were sitting benches out in the town square. At the garage, there were straight-backed chairs. There among the oilcans and tries and spare parts, you could kick back and sit. Houses used to have sitting rooms, where the grown ups would go after Sunday dinner. Mom and Dad, Grandpa and Aunt Ruby would sit and digest   the fried chicken and talk about Aunt Ethel's illness, and how well the minister did today.

Which persons melanocytes produce more melanin, Matt or Jesse?  Matt and his brother Jesse are twins. They look almost identical. If it weren't for the fact that Jesse has a slightly darker skin complexion you wouldn't be able to tell them apart. In fact one year Matt was out in the sun for a long time and picked up a bit of a tan so they actually did look exactly alike.  Hint: The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency.

I mean, completely ludicrous.  Police Officer: Sorry. Don't park your car illegally!  Man: So, you mean that you're going to have my car towed away. I'm standing right here. Look. How about two tickets for a lecture on the history of the English language tomorrow night at the library? Anything.  Police Officer: Sir. It's illegal to bribe an officer.

What would the listener say?

Does the word \\"slot\\" mean the same thing in \\"Bob Dylan occupied the top slot for several weeks.\\" and \\"He put a quarter in the slot.\\"?","output":"The word \\"slot\\" does indeed have different meanings depending on the context in which it is used. In both of the given sentences, the word \\"slot\\" refers to different concepts, although they are connected by the broader idea of a position, space, or opening. 1. In the sentence \\"Bob Dylan occupied the top slot for several weeks,\\" the word \\"slot\\" is used metaphorically to describe a position or ranking. In this case, \\"slot\\" refers to the highest position on a list or chart, such as a music chart or a ranking of popular albums or songs. So, when we say that Bob Dylan occupied the top slot, it means that his music held the highest position or ranking for several weeks – perhaps it was the most popular, best-selling, or critically acclaimed music during that time period. The use of the word \\"slot\\" in this context highlights the competitive nature of the music industry, where artists and their creations are constantly vying for the most prestigious positions in various rankings or metrics. It also evokes the idea that these positions are somewhat fixed, like physical slots or compartments, and just as a person might move an object in and out of a slot, artists can rise and fall in the rankings depending on their performance. 2. In the sentence \\"He put a quarter in the slot,\\" the word \\"slot\\" has a more literal meaning, referring to a physical opening or aperture on a machine or device. This type of slot is specially designed for the purpose of accepting coins or other small objects, which enable the machine to work or perform a specific function. For example, slot machines are a common sight in casinos, where patrons insert coins into the machine to play games and potentially win prizes. Vending machines also use coin slots to allow users to pay for products or services. In this context, \\"slot\\" carries the connotation of functionality, precision, and interaction between the user and the device. Furthermore, it implies a certain level of security and control, as the slots usually have mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access or tampering. In summary, while the word \\"slot\\" can refer to both a metaphorical position or ranking and a literal opening designed to accept coins or other objects, the underlying concept in both instances revolves around the idea of a designated space or opening that serves a specific purpose. By understanding the context in which the word \\"slot\\" appears, one can easily discern its intended meaning and application in the situation."},{"instruction":"In this task you will be given a text passage from a trivia quiz.

Here are the options: Available choices: [-] yes [-] it is not possible to tell [-] no Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"Based on the given premise and hypothesis, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. I will provide a detailed explanation for my reasoning. Premise: \\"Practices by considering the scope of various types of audits and...\\" This premise suggests that there are several types of audits being considered to improve or analyze specific practices. A detailed analysis would be required to determine the distinct types of audits, their scope, and the various factors they encompass. Hypothesis: \\"There is only one type of audit.\\" The hypothesis, on the other hand, directly contradicts the premise by claiming that there is only a single type of audit. This statement reduces the entirety of auditing practices to a sole category, with no consideration of the various audit scopes and purposes mentioned in the premise. When considering the given options, let's examine each one closely: - \\"Yes\\": This option would imply that if the premise were true, then the hypothesis would also be valid. However, this is not the case, as the premise and hypothesis have contradictory information about audit types and scopes. - \\"It is not possible to tell\\": This response does not provide a clear answer to whether the hypothesis can be concluded if the premise is true. Choosing this option might seem like the safe approach, but it does not address the core issue. - \\"No\\": This choice indicates that the hypothesis cannot be considered true if the premise is accurate. The contradictory nature of the hypothesis and premise makes it clear that both of these statements cannot coexist as facts simultaneously. In conclusion, given the discrepancies between the premise and hypothesis, we cannot deduce that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. As a result, the correct option would be \\"No.\\" The premise highlights the existence of various types of audits and their scope, while the hypothesis contradicts this by asserting that only one type of audit exists."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

And Gibson, a blue-eyed charmer to the bitter end, almost manages it. 2.

The showdown with Gibson almost singlehandedly saves the movie -- almost 4. Gibson, who has always been an undervalued actor, does a sturdy job as a grieving dad who still engages in conversations with his dead child; it's almost a letdown when he puts aside his mourning sickness and spirals into melodrama. 5.

Considering about the large amount of money you invest in it, it's worth and reasonable to make sure the teachers in the club are qualified before you join.        Third, it would be better to learn something about nutrition when you practice Yoga. In the very beginning, Yoga was part of the Vedas, bible of the traditional Indian philosophy. So it could be regarded as a kind of lifestyle. When you have decided to care for your body, why not feed it properly? In fact, good clubs have their own nutritionists.

The last Columbia Records reissue of any Frank Sinatra songs on a 10-inch LP record was an album called Hall of Fame, CL 2600, issued on October 26, 1956, containing six songs, one each by Tony Bennett, Rosemary Clooney, Johnnie Ray, Frank Sinatra, Doris Day, and Frankie Laine. The 10-inch LP however had a longer life in the United Kingdom, where important early British rock and roll albums such as Lonnie Donegan's Lonnie Donegan Showcase and Billy Fury's The Sound of Fury were released in that form.

The latter proposes an operation to rescue Julius Limbani (Winston Ntshona), imprisoned former leader of the fictious central African country of Zembalia, who is due to be killed by the military dictator who overthrew him. Limbani, whose people believe he is already dead, is being held in a remote prison, guarded by ferocious African troops known as the \\"Simbas\\", under General Ndofa.Faulkner provisionally accepts the assignment and sets about recruiting his officers, all of whom have worked with him on previous African operations. They comprise:Shaun Fynn (Roger Moore) is a former RAF pilot. He is working as a currency smuggler, but when he realises that he's actually running drugs, he kills the mafia drug dealer and consequently has a death contract placed in his head.

No complaints here!  Then ordered some rolls: spicy roll (forgot name), rainbow, caterpillar, and alaskan. Again, the fish were fresh, but I gotta say, I wasn't a big fan of the alakan roll.

In this task, you will be shown a prompt from a judicial decision and multiple holding statements derived from citations following text in a legal decision.  Holdings represent the governing legal rule when the law is applied to a particular set of facts. There are five answer choices for each citing text. The correct answer is the holding statement that corresponds to the citing text. The four incorrect answers are other holding statements. You should find the correct option. There is a <HOLDING> token in the position of the citing text prompt where the holding statement was extracted. State v. Cañez, 202 Ariz. 133, 42 P.3d 564, 578 (2002)(en banc)(deferring to trial court’s implicit finding of no Batson violation); State v. Shanks, 809 S.W.2d 413, 415-16 (Mo.Ct.App.1991)(noting that, even though the trial court made no express findings, the record was sufficient to evaluate the court’s implicit finding regarding the neutrality of the proffered explanation); State v. Smith, 791 S.W.2d 744, 750 (Mo.Ct.App.1990)(stating that although the trial judge failed to make explicit findings in support of denial of defendant’s Batson’s claim, record is sufficient to support judge's implicit finding that defendant failed to make a prima facie case and would be sufficient for a finding of nonpretextuality); People v. Turner, 294 A.D.2d 192, 743 N.Y.S.2d 78, 79 (N.Y.App.Div.2002)(<HOLDING>); Broden v. State, 923 S.W.2d 183, 186   Holding statements: (A) holding that the record supports the trial judges implicit finding of nonpretextuality (B) holding that the absence of legitimate income supports the finding of probable cause in a forfeiture action (C) holding that the district courts finding of no discrimination was not clearly erroneous because the finding was supported by the record (D) holding that a likelihood that the suspect will escape supports a finding of exigency (E) holding that the appeals court may affirm the ruling of the district court on any basis which the record supports","output":"Given the legal decision citation provided and through the elimination of certain holding statements, the task at hand requires identifying the most suitable holding statement that aligns with the citing text. The case mentions \\"deference to trial court's implicit finding of no Batson violation\\", \\"implicit finding regarding the neutrality of the proffered explanation\\", \\"implicit finding that defendant failed to make a prima facie case\\", and \\"nonpretextuality\\" of decision. These phrases clearly point towards a consistent theme of supporting or affirming findings made by the trial court, despite them being implicit rather than explicit. The overarching commonality is a reliance on the trial record. Let's examine each holding statement to see which best aligns: (A) This holding statement aligns well with our identified theme. It speaks of supporting the trial judge's implicit finding of nonpretextuality based on the record, which resonates with the given citing text. (B) This holding statement seems unrelated as it talks about findings related to a forfeiture action. It does not align with the given citing text. (C) Although this statement speaks of supporting the district court's findings, it talks about non-discrimination, which is not mentioned in the citing text. (D) This holding statement, discussing the finding of exigency based on the likelihood of escape, also doesn't align with the citing text. (E) This holding statement, while encompassing the general concept of affirming the court's ruling based on the record, lacks the specific nuances related to the trial judge's implicit finding of nonpretextuality. So, evaluating the statements based on the provided context, it seems that statement (A) is the most suitable holding statement. Hence, my answer is (A) \\"holding that the record supports the trial judges implicit finding of nonpretextuality\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Possible answers: +no; +yes;","output":"Yes, the two sentences essentially mean the same thing, but with slight structural differences. Both sentences convey that Catherine visits Alison in the hospital and informs Alison of her constant availability for conversation. However, there are subtle variations which can be understood by examining each sentence closely. In Sentence 1: 1. Catherine visits Alison in hospital and tells her that she is always available to talk to her. Here, the sentence clearly states that Catherine visits Alison who is in the hospital. Catherine then communicates her willingness to be available for conversation, specifying \\"her\\" at the end to highlight that she is referring to Alison. In Sentence 2: 2. Catherine visits Alison in hospital, and tells her that she is always available to talk to. Again, Catherine is visiting Alison in the hospital and telling her about being available for conversation. In this instance, however, the sentence omits \\"her\\" at the end. Despite this slight modification, the meaning is still easily understood because of the clear context provided by the rest of the sentence. In everyday language, it is common to exclude the final \\"her\\" for brevity, and native speakers would understand the sentence's intent without any confusion.

Why do they do it? There are several answers.The idea of cooperating and sharing responsibility with one another for the benefit of all is as old as the country itself. When the country was first founded in 1776,it was necessary for the settlers to work together to live.They had crossed dangerous seas and risked all they had in their struggle for political and religious freedom.There remains among many Americans a distrust of central government.People still prefer to do things themselves within their communities,rather than give the government more control.

Here is an article: Cavatelli with Brown Butter Beets: Beets add an earthy note to pasta, especially when they are both topped with brown butter. Iâve had pasta with red sauce hundreds of times; itâs classic, comforting and exactly what youâd expect to coat your linguine. But this autumnâs crop of jewel-like beets has me thinking in an entirely different direction. These days when I make pasta, I think pink: pink beet sauce, that is. It isnât something you come across very often. The first time I had it was at Al Di La in Brooklyn, where the chef Anna Klinger fills her casunziei, which are tender ravioli, with ricotta cheese and purÃ©ed beets. They are served with a buttery sauce darkened with poppy seeds. Itâs a brilliant combination of flavors: assertively sweet and earthy from the beets, delicately milky from the ricotta, rich from the butter. Iâve since adapted the dish to my own lazier disposition. This means instead of making labor intensive homemade ravioli, I turn the filling of beets and ricotta into a magenta sauce. The easiest way to deal with the beets, Iâve found, is not to roast and purÃ©e them. This can take hours. Instead I like to grate and sautÃ© them, which is accomplished in under 20 minutes. Although itâs not strictly necessary, a food processor (if you have one) is worth it for grating. Not only does it make the task quicker, it also makes the effort far less messy, restraining the beet juices instead of letting them spill all over your counter, cutting board and fingers. Then I sautÃ© the beets in loads of nutty brown butter until they absorb all the butter and practically fall apart. This forms the basis of the sauce. Because beets donât have the tanginess of tomatoes, itâs vital to include a little acid in the mix; otherwise, everything seems too heavy and stodgy. Here I drizzle on balsamic vinegar and spike the ricotta with orange zest. Lemon or lime work equally well. As a final touch, I sprinkle the dish with chopped pistachios, which lend the same nutty crunch as the poppy seeds in Ms. Klingerâs sauce, but with the added appeal of the pale green color. Use any kind of nut or seed that you like, or leave them off altogether. Whatever you do, play around and make this beet sauce your own. After all, there are about as many red sauce recipes as there are cooks making red sauce. But not so much when it comes to pink.

Humidors are typically made of wood, and because the wood is porous, it will allow moisture to escape. Seasoning the humidor increases the moisture content of the wood, helping it maintain the humidity inside better.","output":"First, let me explain what a humidor is. A humidor is a special box used to store things like cigars. It helps keep them fresh by controlling the humidity inside the box. Now, let's talk about seasoning a humidor and why we do it. Seasoning a humidor is like getting it ready to do its job. The humidor's main job is to keep the right amount of moisture inside so that items like cigars stay fresh. To season a humidor, you need to make the wood a little moist so that it can properly control the humidity inside. Here are the steps to season a humidor: 1. Gather your supplies: You'll need distilled water, a new sponge, a small bowl, and a plastic bag. 2. Moisten the sponge: Soak the new sponge with distilled water, then squeeze out any extra water. The sponge should be damp, but not dripping wet. 3. Place the sponge and bowl inside the humidor: Put the damp sponge on top of the plastic bag to protect the wood, and place both inside the humidor. Then, fill the small bowl with distilled water and place it inside the humidor as well. 4. Close the humidor and wait: Now, just close the humidor and let it sit for about 24 hours. During this time, the moisture from the sponge and the water in the bowl will help to moisten the wood. 5. Check the moisture level: After 24 hours, check the humidity level inside the humidor. If it's in the right range (around 68-72% humidity), you can remove the sponge and bowl and begin using your humidor. If it's not, repeat steps 2-4 until the humidity is where it needs to be. And that's how you season a humidor! By following these steps, you'll help the wood to control humidity better and keep your cigars fresh and tasty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. From clumsily eating a bacon sandwich to posing in a ‘feminist’ T-shirt made by exploited female labour, Ed Miliband’s public appearances during recent months have been a catalogue of gaffes. Few of these moments have been more awkward than his spontaneous decision to give some loose change to a young beggar while he walked along a street in Manchester last week. If this was an attempt to parade his decency, it backfired disastrously. Instead of looking compassionate, he came across as foolish, opportunistic and embarrassed. Scroll down for video. Founder of the Big Issue John Bird, who says giving money to beggars does nothing to alleviate their plight. Much attention has focused on the reportedly small sum he gave the girl, later identified as a 14-year-old Romanian immigrant. Miliband has also attracted criticism for the disdainful look on his face as he handed over the cash, as if he were repelled by his own action. Yet that air of self-disgust was appropriate. For Miliband knew only too well that he was doing the wrong thing. The key problem was not the size of his donation, but the fact that he actually handed over any money at all. Mr Bird's comments come after Labour leader Ed Miliband was pictured dropping money into a beggar's cup outside Manchester Town Hall. It’s a familiar predicament when we’re faced with another desperate-looking figure huddled on the street, palm outstretched. It’s only human to feel that impulse to help — to give a few coins to alleviate another’s misery — and, all too often, for that impulse to override the quiet voice which asks: am I really helping? The answer is no. Giving to a beggar might momentarily salve the donor’s conscience, but in the longer term it does absolutely nothing to alleviate the plight of the recipient. On the contrary, it locks the beggar in a downward spiral of abject dependency and victimhood, where all self-respect, honesty and hope are lost. Indeed, by reinforcing the beggar’s pitiable condition, a donation is really an act of cruelty rather than kindness. If there is one thing most beggars detest more than people who refuse to give, it is those who do. I should know, because I was a beggar for much of my early life. Growing up in an Irish immigrant family in London with a father who made it his life’s mission to single-handedly prop up the drinks trade, I first experienced homelessness at the age of five, and between the ages of seven and ten was raised in an orphanage, supplementing my meagre pocket money with what I could get on the streets. Mr Bird says that reinforcing the beggar’s pitiable condition, a donation is really an act of cruelty rather than kindness. Begging descended into crime, and through my teenage years I was in and out of prison. But it was that background which gave me the determination to do something for the homeless beyond the usual mix of counter-productive financial concern and judicial punishment (begging and rough-sleeping have been illegal here since the 16th century). What I wanted to do was something that would give the destitute a sense of purpose. So, in 1991, I came up with the idea of the Big Issue magazine, a product which people could sell for a decent profit. The Big Issue represented dynamic street trade, not degraded street aid. Instead of remaining passive, dependent victims, the sellers would become active merchants, gaining discipline, self-worth and honesty. The initiative was widely adopted here and abroad, transforming institutional attitudes to homelessness. I am still gaining insights into how well the scheme can work. The other day, I met up with an old mate called Mark Dempster. More than 20 years ago, he was a real hard-case: an alcoholic drug-dealer who lived on the streets and had served time in prisons all over the world. Mr Miliband made his donation while walking through Manchester with Shadow Transport Secretary Mary Creagh, left, and Manchester Withington candidate Jeff Smith, right. Thanks to the self-respect the Big Issue gave him, he cleaned up his act, escaped his destructive habits and became a responsible adult. He is now a Harley Street specialist in drug and drink addictions, helping others to break free as he did. The alternative — embodied in Ed Miliband’s desperate move — of people giving money to those who simply sit on the street asking for money, only worsens the begging problem. Moreover, such an approach amounts to a collusion with criminality, for not only is begging illegal under a host of laws, such as the 1824 Vagrancy Act, but it is often accompanied — as in Mark Dempster’s example — by other law-breaking, like drug possession, theft, disorderly conduct, and even violence. So there is no doubt that giving to beggars worsens criminality by encouraging the destitute to remain outside the margins of society. Most of the homeless are mentally ill or in the throes of addiction, so cash enables them to spend more on drink or drugs. Alternatively, they can become part of an organised gang that exploits the public’s generosity. That is why I often say the Big Issue is a also ‘crime reduction initiative’, because it helps to steer the magazine vendors away from the possibility of sliding into illegal behaviour. This is true even of the large number of Romanians who now sell the Big Issue on British streets; on my estimates, one in five of all Big Issue vendors is East European. Now, understandably, many British people strongly object to this trend. Why on earth are we, a small country with overstretched public services, importing destitution on such a scale from Eastern Europe? The beggar was later revealed to be 14-year-old Rebeca State, who lives with her aunt as her parents have returned to Romania. That is a question not for the Big Issue organisation, but for the politicians such as Ed Miliband who opened the sluice gates and insisted, for ideological reasons, on open borders within Europe. They are the ones who decided the Romanian poor and homeless should be allowed to settle here. At least the Big Issue gives them work, an income, a roof over their heads and a route away from crime. But that does not mean I am blind to some of the excesses and abuses. Unfortunately, thanks to the ill-conceived bureaucracy of the welfare system, some Bulgarians and Romanians have been allowed to exploit their positions as vendors to gain self-employed status, opening the way to a raft of income-related welfare benefits. That is certainly true in the case of the girl beggar who Mr Miliband met in Manchester. Rebeca State, 14, lives with her aunt, Livia Stoica, in rented accommodation; her parents have returned to Romania because of a family illness. As a ‘self-employed’ Big Issue seller six days a week, Ms Stoica can claim £550 a week in welfare. But again the Big Issue should not be the organisation under attack. It is up to the politicians to close the loopholes over self-employed status and access to social security. This whole case shows the laxity of the authorities’ approach. Ms Stoica might be within her rights to claim welfare as a self-employed individual, but she should certainly not be allowing her 14-year-old niece out on the streets to break the law by begging. Are social services and the police investigating? If not, why not? And why is Rebeca, still only a child, not in school or back with her parents? Mr Bird estimates that one in five people selling the Big Issue on the street are of Eastern European decent (file picture) I fear the answer is there is far too much sentimentality and cowardice in our political system, which has been ruthlessly exploited by society’s parasites. I have absolutely no time for the pathetic, bleeding-heart mentality so prevalent these days — and which destroys traditional concepts of morality and justice. I firmly believe that anyone who breaks the law or abuses our generosity should be deported — not protected by the morally perverted human rights regime which allows them to remain in this country on the basis of their so-called ‘right to a family life’. Indeed, early this year I led calls for the deportation of Razvan Dumitru, a Romanian Big Issue seller based in North London who robbed a blind pensioner of £50 when she tried to pay him for the magazine. For this sickening crime, he was sentenced to just four months in prison. But it is the politicians who created this mess, through their contempt for our borders, reluctance to uphold our laws, and remorseless expansion of our welfare benefits. Ed Miliband’s desperate donation is a classic illustration of warped priorities and lack of ethical rigour. He should be ashamed of himself. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1.

Process:  - A star burns in space - Eventually it burns all its hydrogen - Becomes a red giant - Once the red giant burns itself out - The core of the star collapses - The gasses will start to disperse - Only the core is left - A white dwarf has been formed.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is less hydrogen in the star happens, how will it affect there will be less gasses to disperse.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The process of stellar evolution, which includes the aforementioned steps of a star burning its hydrogen, expanding into a red giant, and eventually collapsing into a white dwarf, is indeed inherently dependent on the composition and mass of a star. Any perturbation in the amount of hydrogen within a star is likely to affect its evolution directly or indirectly. To understand the potential impact of the perturbation hypothesis – that there is less hydrogen in the star – we will analyze its effect on each step of the process. 1. A star burns in space: A star's energy is generated through nuclear fusion, specifically the fusion of hydrogen atoms into helium. If the star has less hydrogen, the rate at which nuclear fusion progresses will be reduced in comparison to stars with a larger hydrogen content. Consequently, the star will produce less energy and burn at a slower pace. 2. Eventually, it burns all its hydrogen: With less hydrogen available for nuclear fusion, the star will reach the end of this phase more rapidly. Since hydrogen fuels the fusion reactions and maintains the balance between the gravitational forces pulling the star inward and the outward pressure exerted by the energy released from fusion, the depletion of hydrogen will lead to the next phase sooner. 3. Becomes a red giant: When a star has consumed most of its hydrogen, it moves on to fusing helium into heavier elements. The outer envelope of the star will expand, and the star will become a red giant. With less hydrogen in the core initially, this process will be expedited, leading to a shorter main-sequence lifespan for the star. 4. Once the red giant burns itself out: In the red giant phase, helium accumulates in the core while the remainder of the hydrogen is burned in a shell around the core. If the star initially had less hydrogen, it might have a smaller envelope during this phase, further accelerating the process. 5. The core of the star collapses: As the helium core contracts, the outer layers of the star are expelled, forming a planetary nebula. With the perturbation hypothesis, the core might be smaller and contract more rapidly, and the resulting planetary nebula might also be smaller or less prominent. 6. The gases will start to disperse: Due to the reduced quantity of hydrogen, the dispersed gases might be less in volume, and their dispersal into space might occur at a different rate than in the case of a star with a larger hydrogen content. 7. Only the core is left: Following the dispersal of the outer layers, the star's core will remain, forming a white dwarf. With less hydrogen and a smaller core in the perturbation hypothesis, the white dwarf's size, temperature, and luminosity may also be impacted. In conclusion, a reduction in the amount of hydrogen within a star, as proposed in the perturbation hypothesis, would indeed have both direct and indirect effects on the star's evolution process. The overall lifespan and characteristics of the star would be altered, leading to differences in size, brightness, and the eventual outcome of the star's evolution."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

First Robbery: Incident Details and Context As the sparkling streets of Paris are adorned with high-end boutiques and luxurious stores, these iconic locations do not seem to be exempt from the sinister activities of thieves. The latest burglary to have befallen a renowned jewelry store in the area involved the theft of luxury watches estimated to be worth a staggering 800,000 euros. A swift and meticulously planned operation saw the criminals make away with a significant number of high-value timepieces, leaving the store and its patrons in a state of shock. Similar Incident: Jewelry Store Robbery in September Unfortunately, this is not the first incident of its kind in the area. Just a month earlier, in September, another jewelry store faced a similar situation. Valuable gems and precious metal pieces were pilfered, leaving the owners distraught and the local community disturbed. These incidents have led to a heightened sense of urgency for improved security measures in the upscale Parisian district. Safety and Security Concerns in Affluent Neighborhoods While the image of Paris typically exudes glamour and sophistication, these robberies present a stark reminder that nowhere is entirely safe from crime - not even the exclusive shopping havens in the heart of the city. As these thefts continue to unfold, both residents and tourists are left questioning the safety of the prominent district. It is necessary for the Parisian authorities and businesses to invest in fortified security measures to combat the rising instances of crime in these areas. Implications for Business Owners and Law Enforcement The continued occurrence of high-profile robberies calls for a collaborative approach between store owners, local authorities, and law enforcement agencies. Investing in state-of-the-art security systems, increasing police presence in the area, and fostering community vigilance are some key strategies to be employed. By working together, the risk of future incidents can be significantly reduced, helping to regain public confidence and ensuring the safety of shoppers. Conclusion: The recent robberies at luxury jewelry stores in an elite Parisian district serve as a chilling reminder of the ever-present risks faced by these businesses. While the robbers have not been apprehended, their actions have instilled a sense of urgency for all stakeholders – from store owners to local police – to improve security measures and collaborate to prevent future incidents. As the heart of Paris remains an alluring shopping destination for discerning customers, it is crucial for businesses and residents to regain the sense of safety that befits this prestigious area. Only through concerted effort can the image of indulgence and extravagance be restored, and the shimmer of the City of Light be preserved for generations to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Having been a regular there for his research, he sets up an appointment, his cab driver told to wait outside. Taking insult when the head monk calls his work \\"fiction\\", Lovecraft insists that all his writings are true. Requesting to read the Alchemical Encyclopedia Vol. III, Lovecraft steals a key from another monk and flees to the cellar where the Necronomicon is being held. Unknown to him, a monk has seen him. Unlocking the vault where the book is held, the door closes behind Lovecraft unexpectedly, making him drop the key down a grating and into the water below. As that happens, one of the seals is opened. Lovecraft sits to read and record what he is reading.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Nilsson was born in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn in 1941. His paternal grandparents were Swedish circus performers and dancers, especially known for their \\"aerial ballet\\" (which is the title of one of Nilsson's albums). His maternal grandparents were the cornerstone of his young life. While his grandmother played piano, his grandfather Charlie supported the family in a tiny railroad apartment on Jefferson St in Brooklyn. Nilsson is the subject of a 2006 documentary, Who Is Harry Nilsson (And Why Is Everybody Talkin' About Him)? produced by David Leaf and John Schienfeld. The film was screened in 2006 at the Seattle International Film Festival and the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. In August 2006, the film received its Los Angeles premiere when it was screened at the 7th Annual Mods & Rockers Film Festival followed by a panel discussion about Nilsson featuring the filmmakers and two friends of Nilsson, producer Richard Perry and attorney/executive producer Lee Blackman.  The filmmakers re-edited the film with rare found footage of Nilsson, further interviews, and family photographs, and finally released it on September 17, 2010 at selected theaters in the United States. A DVD, including additional footage not in the theatrical release, was released on October 26, 2010.  Nilsson's final album, tentatively titled Papa's Got a Brown New Robe (produced by Mark Hudson) was not released, though several demos from the album were available on promotional CDs and online.  The musical Everyday Rapture features three songs by Nilsson and, similarly, the film A Good Year features \\"Gotta get up\\", \\"Jump into the fire\\" and \\"How can I be sure of you\\".  On July 29, 2013, Sony Music released a definitive box-set of his RCA era albums called The RCA Albums Collection. Each of the albums in the 17-CD set had additional bonus tracks, along with 3 of the 17 discs that contained rarities and outtakes spanning his entire career. Additionally, several weeks later on August 13, Flash Harry was finally issued on CD also featuring additional material.

Question: What is the final step of the following process: -  You breathe oxygen into your body through the nose or mouth - The oxygen travels to the lungs through the windpipe - The air sacs in the lungs send the oxygen into the blood stream - The carbon dioxide in the blood stream is transferred to the air sacs Answer:","output":"The final step of the process would be: - The carbon dioxide that has been transferred to the air sacs is then expelled from the body as you exhale. Justification: 1. Breathing in (inhaling) oxygen through the nose or mouth: Oxygen-rich air enters the body through the nose or mouth, providing the necessary element to sustain life. 2. Oxygen travels to the lungs through the windpipe: The oxygenated air flows down the windpipe (trachea) and then divides into two bronchi which each lead to a lung. This transport process ensures the oxygen reaches the lungs efficiently. 3. Air sacs in the lungs send the oxygen into the bloodstream: Once the oxygen reaches the tiny air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs, it diffuses across the thin alveolar walls into the capillaries, where it binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells. This process efficiently transfers oxygen from the lungs to the bloodstream. 4. Carbon dioxide in the bloodstream is transferred to the air sacs: As oxygen enters the bloodstream, carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular respiration, is transported from the cells back to the lungs through the blood. When blood flows through the capillaries surrounding the alveoli, carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood back into the air sacs. 5. Carbon dioxide is expelled from the body as you exhale: After carbon dioxide has been transferred to the air sacs, it needs to leave the body to maintain a healthy balance. During exhalation, the diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax, increasing pressure in the chest cavity and causing air (now containing carbon dioxide) to flow out of the lungs and through the mouth or nose. This completes the cycle of respiration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"No, the provided information does not directly answer the question about the forces included in the coalition force. Let me provide a more detailed answer: Coalition forces refer to an alliance of different countries, usually brought together for a specific military operation or intervention. The composition of coalition forces may vary depending on the specific situation or mission. Some well-known examples of coalition forces include the \\"Coalition of the Willing\\" during the Iraq War in 2003 and the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2014. In the case of the Iraq War, the coalition included the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Poland, and other countries which contributed smaller numbers of troops or support elements. The ISAF in Afghanistan was led by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and included member states as well as partner countries, such as the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Australia, and many others. As for the casualties mentioned in the original answer you posted, it is true that the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada sustained a significant proportion of the casualties in those conflicts, but this information does not inform you about the participating forces in the coalition.

SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country. Ending the severe U.S. led sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade that were imposed for the North’s repeated nuclear and missile tests, would open the door to increased economic investment and cooperation.

Article: As a teacher, I always think it right to teach my students to write about their true feelings and real experiences. But once I was puzzled about this. After explaining a text one day, I asked my students to write a passage about their families. All the students wrote quite well but the best of them all was the one written by a small girl. I was deeply touched by it. The girl's father had died years before and her mother had to work hard to support the family. Many times she had seen her mother working deep into the night but never seen tears on her face. Like her mother this girl also works hard at her lessons and she is really good at any of them. I even didn't know anything about her unlucky family. She always appears happy every day so she is really liked by us all, both the students and teachers. In order to make her an example to the class, I read this passage to the class. When I finished reading it I found my throat _ and my students' eyes full of tears. Some of them even wept in a low voice. After the class nearly all my other students wanted to hand in their pocket money for the daily use to help this girl. To tell you the truth, I was really proud of my students. But to my disappointment, this student of mine left the class even without telling me the next day. I don't know the reason why, can you tell me? Question: Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage? - The teacher asked her students to read the little girl's article by themselves. - The little girl's father died of a traffic accident. - The little girl's classmates were willing to help her. - The little girl's mother blamed her for her writing.

The second major point on which the principals had agreed on March 10 was the need to crack down on terrorist organizations and curtail their fund-raising. The embassy bombings of 1998 had focused attention on al Qaeda's finances. One result had been the creation of an NSC-led interagency committee on terrorist financing. On its recommendation, the President had designated  Bin Laden and al Qaeda as subject to sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. This gave theTreasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) the ability to search for and freeze any  Bin Laden or al Qaeda assets that reached the U.S. financial system. But since OFAC had little information to go on, few funds were frozen. In July 1999, the President applied the same designation to the Taliban for harboring  Bin Laden. Here, OFAC had more success. It blocked more than 34 million in Taliban assets held in U.S. banks. Another 215 million in gold and 2 million in demand deposits, all belonging to the Afghan central bank and held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, were also frozen. After October 1999, when the State Department formally designated al Qaeda a \\"foreign terrorist organization,\\" it became the duty of U.S. banks to block its transactions and seize its funds. Neither this designation nor UN sanctions had much additional practical effect; the sanctions were easily circumvented, and there were no multilateral mechanisms to ensure that other countries' financial systems were not used as conduits for terrorist funding. Attacking the funds of an institution, even the Taliban, was easier than finding and seizing the funds of a clandestine worldwide organization like al Qaeda. Although the CIA's  Bin Laden unit had originally been inspired by the idea of studying terrorist financial links, few personnel assigned to it had any experience in financial investigations. Any terrorist-financing intelligence appeared to have been collected collaterally, as a consequence of gathering other intelligence. This attitude may have stemmed in large part from the chief of this unit, who did not believe that simply following the money from point A to point B revealed much about the terrorists' plans and intentions. As a result, the CIA placed little emphasis on terrorist financing. Nevertheless, the CIA obtained a general understanding of how al Qaeda raised money.  Question: \\"How much money was frozen after the President applied the same designation to the Taliban?\\" Answer: \\"34 million in Taliban assets in U.S. banks, another 215 million in gold and 2 million in demand deposits\\" Is this answer to the question correct? pick from the following.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Whose message said we are solely grieved to be among beasts like these who believe in God nor in anything? ?  In 1688, the Spanish sent three more expeditions, two by sea and one by land. The land expedition, led by Alonso De León, discovered Jean Gery, who had deserted the French colony and was living in Southern Texas with the Coahuiltecans. Using Gery as a translator and guide, De León finally found the French fort in late April 1689. The fort and the five crude houses surrounding it were in ruins. Several months before, the Karankawa had attacked the settlement. They destroyed the structures and left the bodies of three people, including a woman who had been shot in the back. A Spanish priest who had accompanied De León conducted funeral services for the three victims. The chronicler of the Spanish expedition, Juan Bautista Chapa, wrote that the devastation was God's punishment for opposing the Pope, as Pope Alexander VI had granted the Indies exclusively to the Spanish. The remains of the fort were destroyed by the Spanish, who also buried the French cannons left behind. The Spanish later built a fort on the same location. In early 1689, Spanish authorities received a plea, written in French. Jumano scouts had received these papers from the Caddo, who asked that they be delivered to the Spanish. The papers included a parchment painting of a ship, as well as a written message from Jean L'Archevêque. The message read: I do not know what sort of people you are. We are French[;] we are among the savages[;] we would like much to be Among the Christians such as we are[.] ... we are solely grieved to be among beasts like these who believe neither in God nor in anything.

By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.

Meanwhile, John Quincy Archibald and his wife Denise witness their young son Michael collapse at his baseball game and take Michael to the hospital. After a series of tests at the hospital, John is informed by Dr. Raymond Turner and Rebecca Payne, the hospital administrator, that his son has an enlarged heart and will need a heart transplant to live. The procedure is very expensive: 250,000 (at a minimum), with a down payment of 75,000 (30%) required to get Michael's name on the organ donor list. John tells them he is insured, but after looking through his policy, they tell him that because the company he works for dropped John from full-time to part-time, his health insurance has been changed, and the new policy does not cover the surgery, which leaves John and Denise to raise 75,000 on their own. The family tries to raise the money but are only able to come up with a third of the necessary payment. The hospital tires of waiting and releases Michael; Denise urges John to do something.

Information:  - In finance, a loan is the lending of money from one individual, organization or entity to another individual, organization or entity. A loan is a debt provided by an entity (organization or individual) to another entity at an interest rate, and evidenced by a promissory note which specifies, among other things, the principal amount of money borrowed, the interest rate the lender is charging, and date of repayment. A loan entails the reallocation of the subject asset(s) for a period of time, between the lender and the borrower.  - Tertiary education, also referred to as third stage, third level, and post-secondary education, is the educational level following the completion of a school providing a secondary education. The World Bank, for example, defines tertiary education as including universities as well as institutions that teach specific capacities of higher learning such as colleges, technical training institutes, community colleges, nursing schools, research laboratories, centers of excellence, and distance learning centers. Higher education is taken to include undergraduate and postgraduate education, while vocational education and training beyond secondary education is known as \\"further education\\" in the United Kingdom, or \\"continuing education\\" in the United States.  - Higher education, post-secondary education, or third level education is an optional final stage of formal learning that occurs after completion of secondary education. Often delivered at universities, academies, colleges, seminaries, and institutes of technology, higher education is also available through certain college-level institutions, including vocational schools, trade schools, and other career colleges that award academic degrees or professional certifications. Tertiary education at non-degree level is sometimes referred to as further education or continuing education as distinct from higher education.  - Continuing education (similar to further education in the United Kingdom and Ireland) is an all-encompassing term within a broad list of post-secondary learning activities and programs. The term is used mainly in the United States and parts of Canada. Recognized forms of post-secondary learning activities within the domain include: degree credit courses by non-traditional students, non-degree career training, workforce training, formal personal enrichment courses (both on-campus and online) self-directed learning (such as through Internet interest groups, clubs or personal research activities) and experiential learning as applied to problem solving.  - Secondary education normally takes place in secondary schools, taking place after primary education and may be followed by higher education or vocational training. In some countries, only primary or basic education is compulsory, but secondary education is included in compulsory education in most countries. In post-Soviet countries it is also known as general education or general middle education.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - Further education (often abbreviated FE) in the United Kingdom and Ireland, similar to continuing education in the United States, is a term used to refer to education (in addition to that received at secondary school), that is distinct from the higher education offered in universities and also some FE colleges. It may be at any level in compulsory secondary education, from entry to higher level qualifications such as awards, certificates, diplomas and other vocational, competency-based qualifications (including those previously known as NVQ/SVQs) through awarding organisations including City and Guilds, Edexcel (BTEC) and OCR. In addition, HE qualifications are often provided such as HNC, HND, Foundation Degree or PGCE. FE colleges are also a large provider of apprenticeships, where most of the training takes place in the apprentices' workplace with some day release into college.  - National Higher Education Fund Corporation ( Malay : Perbadanan Tabung Pendidikan Tinggi Nasional ) , abbreviated PTPTN is an authority responsible for giving study loans to students pursuing tertiary education in Malaysia .

Which civil servant at the Ministry of Defence was tried and acquitted in 1985 of leaking documents to Tam Dalyell MP about the sinking of the 'Belgrano' during the Falklands War?","output":"The civil servant at the Ministry of Defence who was tried and acquitted in 1985 for leaking documents to Tam Dalyell MP regarding the sinking of the 'Belgrano' during the Falklands War was Clive Ponting. Ponting worked as a senior civil servant in the Ministry of Defence, and in 1984, he leaked two classified documents to Tam Dalyell, a Labour Member of Parliament who was highly critical of the British government's actions during the Falklands War. The 'Belgrano' was an Argentine Navy cruiser that played a significant role in the 1982 Falklands War. The British Royal Navy submarine HMS Conqueror sunk the 'Belgrano' on May 2, 1982, resulting in the loss of 323 Argentine lives. The sinking of the 'Belgrano' was a controversial event, as it took place outside the exclusion zone that the British government had established around the Falklands, sparking a heated debate about whether the attack was justified or not. Clive Ponting leaked these documents to Dalyell with the intention of providing evidence that the British government had misled the public about the circumstances surrounding the sinking of the 'Belgrano'. Ponting believed that by making this information public, he could expose the perceived lack of transparency of the UK government. The case against Ponting saw him charged under Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911, which prohibited the disclosure of sensitive government information. The trial took place at the Old Bailey in London, beginning in January 1985 and concluding in February of the same year. During his trial, Ponting argued that he had acted in the public interest. He believed that the government had deliberately concealed the truth about the 'Belgrano' sinking from both the Parliament and the public, thereby compromising the principles of democracy and accountability. The jury, after hearing the arguments presented by both the prosecution and the defense, acquitted Clive Ponting. The decision of the jury was significant because it appeared to endorse the idea that public officials had a higher duty to the public interest and to the truth than to the secrecy laws imposed by the government. Consequently, Ponting's acquittal provided the impetus for the subsequent reform of the Official Secrets Act in 1989. The Clive Ponting trial was a significant event in British history as it highlighted the tension between the government's desire for secrecy and the principle of public accountability. It also underscored the importance of maintaining the trust between the government and its citizens by ensuring that information is transparent and accessible, especially in matters of war and national security."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Despite the presence of camera crews from (at least) France 2, Associated Press and Reuters, there is no footage of the c. 17 minutes Jamal and Muhammad waited for an ambulance or of them being loaded into one. There is no film of the death of the first ambulance driver, Bassam al-Bilbeisi, who was reportedly shot on his way to pick them up. Several commentators questioned what time the shooting occurred; what time Muhammad arrived at the hospital; why there seemed to be little blood on the ground where they were shot; and whether any bullets were collected. Several alleged that, in other scenes in the raw footage, it is clear that protesters are play acting. One physician maintained that Jamal's scars were not from bullet wounds, but dated back to an injury he sustained in the early 1990s.There was no criminal inquiry. Palestinian police allowed journalists to photograph the scene the following day, but they gathered no forensic evidence. According to a Palestinian general, there was no Palestinian investigation because there was no doubt that the Israelis had killed the boy. General Yom Tov Samia of the IDF said the presence of protesters meant the Israelis were unable to examine and take photographs of the scene. The increase in violence at the junction cut off the Nezarim settlers, so the IDF evacuated them and, a week after the shooting, blew up everything within 500 metres of the IDF outpost, thereby destroying the crime scene.A pathologist examined the boy's body, but there was no full autopsy. It is unclear whether bullets were recovered from the scene or from Jamal and Muhammad. In 2002 Abu Rahma implied to Esther Schapira that he had collected bullets at the scene, adding: \\"We have some secrets for ourselves.

Additional measures were taken to undermine the traditional clan system, which had been under severe stress even before 1745 due to changing economic conditions. The Heritable Jurisdictions Act ended the traditional powers exercised by chiefs over their clansmen while the Act of Proscription outlawed Highland dress unless worn in military service. This Act was repealed in 1782, by which time its purpose had been achieved. The Jacobite cause did not entirely disappear after 1746 but the exposure of the key factions' conflicting objectives ended it as a serious threat. Many Scots were disillusioned by Charles' leadership while areas in England that were strongly Jacobite in 1715 like Northumberland and County Durham provided minimal support in 1745. Irish Jacobite societies continued but increasingly reflected opposition to the existing order rather than affection for the Stuarts and were absorbed by the Republican United Irishmen.","output":"What steps were taken to prevent future rebellions after the survey of the Highlands, and how did these measures affect the traditional clan system and Highland dress in Scotland?"},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Make this proper case.","output":"Despite the bitter antagonism between Cantor and Kronecker, Cantor invited Kronecker to address this first meeting as a sign of respect for one of the senior and most eminent figures in German mathematics. The rivalry between Georg Cantor, the founder of set theory, and Leopold Kronecker, an influential mathematician known for his contributions to number theory, is well documented in the annals of mathematical history. They were two of the greatest mathematicians of their time, but their contrasting beliefs and approaches to mathematics led to frequent clashes between the two. Cantor and Kronecker first crossed paths in the early 1870s during one of Cantor's visits to the University of Berlin. It was clear from the onset that their views on the foundations of mathematics were vastly different. Cantor's revolutionary work on set theory and the concept of infinity contrasted sharply with Kronecker's conservative belief in the finiteness of mathematical concepts. Over time, their ideological differences developed into a bitter personal rivalry, with Kronecker publicly disparaging Cantor's work and even hindering his career advancement. However, this antagonism between Cantor and Kronecker did not eclipse their mutual admiration and respect for each other's mathematical prowess. Cantor was well aware of Kronecker's prominent status in the German mathematical community and his many contributions to areas such as algebra and number theory. Similarly, Kronecker could not deny Cantor's brilliant intellect and the originality of his ideas, even if he disagreed with them. It was this recognition of Kronecker's eminence that led to Cantor extending an olive branch in the form of an invitation for Kronecker to address the first meeting of a newly formed mathematical society. This was a significant event in the lives of both men, as it displayed Cantor's willingness to put their differences aside in the interest of furthering the pursuit of mathematical knowledge. Despite their disagreements, Cantor's gesture illustrated an inherent understanding of the importance of Kronecker's place in the history of mathematics and a willingness to acknowledge the value of his work. In extending this invitation, Cantor demonstrated the ability to rise above their longstanding rivalry to focus on the greater good of mathematics and its development. It not only underscored the deep level of respect he had for Kronecker as a fellow mathematician, but also highlighted the broader lesson that differing viewpoints and even conflicts can be set aside in the pursuit of common objectives and shared passions. It remains unclear whether Kronecker accepted the invitation to speak at Cantor's event. However, the fact that Cantor reached out to his rival shows his maturity and capacity for humility, and serves as a powerful example of the human side of these two great mathematicians. This gesture, minor as it may seem, is a testament to their commitment to the advancement of knowledge and the further exploration of the boundaries of mathematical thought."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: A Nobel Prize is considered by most people one of the highest international honours  a person can receive. As you know, the prizes were started by a Swede called Alfred Nobel. He was born in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden. Alfred Nobel was a great scientist. He made two important inventions, and so he became very rich. Although he was rich, Nobel was not a happy man. He never married or had children. Also, he was a sick man during his large part of life. When he died at the age of 63, he left a fund of 9,000,000. The money was to be used in giving prizes to those who made great achievements in physics, chemistry , medicine and literature , and for world peace. The first Nobel Prizes were given on December 10, 1901, five years after Nobel's death. Since then many famous people from all over the world have been given Nobel Prizes for their achievements. Each prize has three parts. The first part is a gold medal. Second, a winner of a Nobel Prize is given a certificate saying that he has been given the prize. The third part of the prize is a large amount of money-about 40,000. Often a prize is given to just one person, but not always. Sometimes a prize is shared. It may be given to two or more people who have worked together. It is also sometimes true that a prize is not given at all if there is no great achievement. In 1972, for example, no Nobel Peace Prize was given. When was Alfred Nobel born? A) In 1938. B) In 1833. C) In 1896.

Options: - urban area - strip mall - office - town - medical building  Explain why a human would choose \\"medical building\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"medical building\\" as the answer to the question because it is the most logical and fitting option among the given choices. Firstly, a medical building is a designated facility that houses various healthcare providers, including dental offices, along with other similar medical professionals and services. These buildings are specifically designed to accommodate the unique needs of the healthcare industry, with features such as shared patient waiting areas, easy access to medical labs and diagnostics, ample parking, and accessibility for patients. Comparing with other options: - Urban area: This choice is too broad and does not provide enough specific information about the location. An urban area can comprise various types of establishments, such as residential buildings, commercial centers, and other non-medical facilities, making this response less precise than \\"medical building.\\" - Strip mall: While a dental office may sometimes be located in a strip mall, this type of location typically houses a range of retail businesses and small offices. A strip mall is less likely to be specifically designed or equipped to accommodate medical and healthcare providers, which is why \\"medical building\\" would be a more appropriate response. - Office: Although a dental office is indeed an office, this term does not adequately convey the coexistence of other similar healthcare providers in the same facility. Moreover, the question specifically asks for the location of the dental office and other similar medical providers, making \\"office\\" too vague of an option. - Town: Similar to \\"urban area,\\" the term \\"town\\" is also a general term that includes various establishments and areas, not necessarily indicating a specific location for medical providers. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"medical building\\" because it accurately encapsulates the nature of the location, where a dental office coexists alongside other similar healthcare providers. This option correctly implies that the facility is purpose-built for medical practices and services, making it the most relevant and accurate choice among the given alternatives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The work raised the band's profile and landed them a major-label American record deal with Elektra Records. Their first album under Elektra, Transient Random-Noise Bursts with Announcements (August 1993), was an underground success in both the US and the UK. Mark Jenkins commented in Washington Post that with the album, Stereolab \\"continues the glorious drones of [their] indie work, giving celestial sweep to [their] garage-rock organ pumping and rhythm-guitar strumming\\". In the UK, the album was released on Duophonic Ultra High Frequency Disks, which is responsible for domestic releases of Stereolab's major albums.In January 1994, Stereolab achieved their first chart entry when the 1993 EP Jenny Ondioline, entered at number 75 on the UK Singles Chart. (Over the next three years, four more releases by the band would appear on this chart, ending with the EP Miss Modular in 1997.) Their third album, Mars Audiac Quintet, was released in August 1994. The album contains the single \\"Ping Pong\\", which gained press coverage for its allegedly explicit Marxist lyrics. The band focused more on pop and less on rock, resulting in what AllMusic described as \\"what may be the group's most accessible, tightly-written album\\". It was the last album to feature O'Hagan as a full-time member. He would continue to make guest appearances on later releases. The group issued an EP titled Music for the Amorphous Body Study Center in April 1995. The EP was their musical contribution to an interactive art exhibit put on in collaboration with New York City artist Charles Long.

In the first sentence, \\"He's just been released from Shadwell nick prison after doing ten years for attempted murder,\\" the word \\"nick\\" is referring to the prison where the person was incarcerated for ten years.

The Court of Cassation, the highest court in the judicial order, which reviews criminal and civil cases, is located in the Palais de Justice on the Île de la Cité, while the Conseil d'État, which provides legal advice to the executive and acts as the highest court in the administrative order, judging litigation against public bodies, is located in the Palais-Royal in the 1st arrondissement. The Constitutional Council, an advisory body with ultimate authority on the constitutionality of laws and government decrees, also meets in the Montpensier wing of the Palais Royal.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Among the options provided, civil cases are not reviewed by the Conseil d'État. The Conseil d'État is primarily responsible for providing legal advice to the executive and acting as the highest court in the administrative order, which includes judging litigation against public bodies. On the other hand, the Court of Cassation is the highest court in the judicial order, and its main function is to review civil and criminal cases. France has a dual judicial system, with distinct courts for administrative and civil/criminal matters. The Conseil d'État, located in the Palais-Royal in the 1st arrondissement of Paris, plays a critical role in the administrative division of the legal system. This court deals with disputes and litigation involving public bodies, including actions taken by the state, municipal governments, and other public authorities. The role of the Conseil d'État is to ensure that the actions of public bodies conform to the principles of legality and justice, as well as to protect the rights of citizens who may be affected by the actions of these entities. In addition to judging litigation against public bodies, the Conseil d'État serves another significant function: providing legal advice to the executive branch of the French government. This function includes offering guidance on the drafting and implementation of laws, regulations, and administrative decisions. The Conseil d'État may also have a consultative role in specific instances, depending on the nature and complexity of the case, but its primary function is to ensure the legality of governmental action. The Court of Cassation, situated in the Palais de Justice on the Île de la Cité, is the highest court in the judicial order. It is responsible for reviewing civil and criminal cases. Its central role is to maintain consistency and coherence in the application of the law across France by ensuring that lower courts correctly interpret and apply French legal rules and principles. The Court of Cassation does not reexamine the facts of a case but rather focuses on whether the law was correctly applied in a given case. If the court finds errors in judgment, it can reverse the ruling of the lower court and return the case to a lower court for reassessment. In conclusion, the Conseil d'État mainly focuses on litigation against public bodies and providing legal advice to the executive, while the Court of Cassation is responsible for reviewing civil and criminal cases in France. Consequently, civil cases are not reviewed by the Conseil d'État."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Ask if there are any cough drops at the house or where the box of kleenex is. Don't overdo it with the parents. Explanation: (1) is incorrect because the sentence is both confusing and contradictory. It starts by mentioning that the person is not feeling well that morning but then switches to mentioning that they are sick at night. It is unclear and does not effectively convey a believable message to parents. (2) is also incorrect as it contains several phrases that don't make sense, like \\"sick/sick/whatever you're faking\\" and \\"super friendly.\\" These phrases do not effectively convey the message of pretending to be sick. (3) is not a good option because by saying, \\"I feel better today than when I got here,\\" you are suggesting that you are feeling better, not worse, which contradicts the idea of faking sick. Furthermore, discussing feeling unwell at lunch and telling others that they are worried is not an effective way to fake sick to the school nurse. (4) is the correct answer because it provides a believable and subtle way to convey the idea of being unwell to the parents. Asking about cough drops or the location of a box of kleenex is a more indirect approach that does not come across as overacting, making it a more convincing strategy.

Article: Boko Haram has overtaken Isis as the world’s most deadly terrorist organisation, according to a new report.      The Nigerian-based terror group, also known as Islamic State’s West’s Africa province (ISWAP), was responsible for 6,644 deaths in 2014.      In comparison, Isis is believed to have killed 6,073 people in the same period. Boko Haram pledged allegiance to the group, also known as the Islamic State, in March of this year.      Isis has certainly sought - and achieved - global notoriety since it announced its creation of a caliphate across Syria and Iraq in June 2014.      It has its own media arm which pumps out propaganda videos and messages to either inspire supporters or strike fear into those it regards as enemies with graphic footage glorifying executions and torture. It has also claimed responsibility for the most recent terror attacks in Paris and Egypt, where a plane containing 229 was downed.      Boko Haram carries out most of its atrocities in north Africa. Over the past year, Nigeria witnessed a 300 per cent rise in fatalities from terror acts to 7,512. This is the largest increase in terrorist-caused deaths ever recorded by any country, and is predominantly down to Boko Haram’s expansion.      In 2013, Nigeria ranked fifth in terms of the highest levels of deaths, but moved to second last year.      Boko Haram is not limited to Nigeria: in 2014 the group doubled its attack and expanded into Chad and Cameroon, in 2014 staging 46 attacks and claiming 520 lives.      While increased use of explosives and bombs – thanks to training from other terrorist outfits – has characterised more recent Boko Haram attacks, the majority of attacks remain armed assaults using machine guns.      The data, published in the third edition of the Global Terrorism Index, was produced by the Institute for Economic and Peace, and drawn from data collected by the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), collated by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism. ||||| The grisly attacks in France and Lebanon last week have fixed attention on the violence perpetrated by ISIS. But a study published this week indicates that the world’s deadliest terrorist organization actually operates thousands of miles south of Paris and Beirut, in Nigeria.      The 2015 Global Terrorism Index, published by the Institute for Economics & Peace, found that Boko Haram, the Nigerian jihadist group, was responsible for 6,644 deaths in 2014, compared with 6,073 at the hands of ISIS. Boko Haram, which was founded in 2002 as an Islamist movement against Western education and morphed into an armed insurgency in 2009, has rapidly expanded its scope and ambitions over the past two years, achieving international notoriety in the spring of 2014 by kidnapping more than 200 schoolgirls. Much like ISIS, the organization controls territory in Nigeria (although it has lost some of it over the past year) and has declared a caliphate in that territory. The group is also international; although based in northeastern Nigeria, it has launched attacks in Cameroon, Chad, and Niger. In the latest incident, Boko Haram is the suspected author of an attack in the Nigerian city of Yola that has left more than 30 people dead.      Global Terrorism Database / Institute for Economics and Peace      The scale of Boko Haram’s bloodlust may come as a surprise to those who are more used to hearing about Mosul than Maiduguri, but the Obama administration is well aware of the threat posed by the group. The U.S. government has been providing training, equipment, and funding to countries menaced by Boko Haram, though it has notably declined to sell weapons to the Nigerian government. Two weeks before announcing his decision to send Special Operations Forces into Syria, Barack Obama authorized the deployment of 300 U.S. troops to Cameroon, accompanied by unarmed Predator drones, to help in the struggle against the Nigerian terrorist group.      Data from the Global Terrorism Index, which is based on the University of Maryland’s database of terrorist attacks around the world since 1970, demonstrates why Boko Haram is worthy of such attention. In last year’s index, which my colleague Kathy Gilsinan explored, Nigeria had the fourth-highest number of deaths by terrorism of any country in the world; in this year’s, it had the second-highest, falling only behind Iraq. Nigeria also experienced the largest increase in deaths from terrorism on record: a 300-percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Notably, Boko Haram was responsible for fewer terrorist incidents than ISIS—453 compared with 1,071—which only emphasizes the lethality of its attacks. In 2014, the group perpetrated half of the world’s 20 most fatal terrorist attacks. |||||Summary:","output":"A new report by the Institute for Economics & Peace reveals that Boko Haram has now overtaken ISIS as the world's deadliest terrorist organization.

Given the background: When soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma.  and the situation: United States has varied geographical characteristics. Take for example, the Mississippi Delta. The delta has vast wetland that gets inundated every year. On the contrary, farther west, the Mojave Desert in Nevada sees very little precipitation or floodwater. Both places are beautiful in their own right, and attract many tourists every year.  Answer the following question: Which place would see less nitrification, Mississippi Delta or Mojave Desert?","output":"Given the background information on hypoxic soils and their effect on nitrification, we can determine which location would see less nitrification by comparing the characteristics of both Mississippi Delta and Mojave Desert. Here are the steps to deduce the answer: Step 1: Assess environmental conditions of both locations Mississippi Delta: This area is a vast wetland that experiences annual inundation, leading to flooded soils and formation of hypoxic conditions. Under these conditions, soil microorganisms consume oxygen rapidly, leading to low oxygen availability. Mojave Desert: This area receives very little precipitation or floodwater, indicating that the soil is less likely to be flooded and hypoxic conditions are less likely to develop. Step 2: Consider the effect of hypoxic conditions on nitrification When hypoxic conditions develop, nitrification is inhibited, as there is a lack of oxygen in the soil. Anaerobic bacteria use alternative electron acceptors, such as nitrate, manganese, and sulfate, leading to the formation of toxic compounds. Step 3: Compare the nitrification rates in both locations Mississippi Delta: The wetland environment, with its hypoxic conditions, would inhibit nitrification due to the lack of oxygen. Mojave Desert: The desert environment, with less likelihood of flooded soils and hypoxic conditions, would likely have a higher rate of nitrification compared to the Mississippi Delta. Conclusion: The Mississippi Delta would see less nitrification due to its wetland environment and the presence of hypoxic soils, as compared to the Mojave Desert, which has a lower likelihood of developing hypoxic conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I read this background article the other day: Acromyrmex heyeri is a species of leaf-cutter ant, a New World ant of the subfamily Myrmicinae of the genus Acromyrmex. Acromyrmex heyeri workers construct the colonies nest by thatching together cut grass. At temperatures ranging from 20–30 °C, workers created more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up as a method of temperature regulation for the colony. The workers will close openings in the nest thatch as the air humidity surrounding the nest decreases to reduce water loss for the colony.  I am facing a new situation today: In the ant world a war has been waged. Two rival groups of Acromyrmex heyeri ants, group A and group B, are battling each other to gain territory. The goal is to attack the rival group when they have more openings in their nest thatch. In battle day one group A territory had 5 °C temperature. In battle day two group A territory had 22 °C temperature. In battle day three group A territory had low air humidity. In battle day four group A territory had high air humidity.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: In battle day one would group A have less openings or more openings in their nest thatch? The answer is:","output":"In battle day one, group A would have less openings in their nest thatch.  According to the background article, Acromyrmex heyeri ants create more openings in the nest thatch when the internal nest temperature goes up and the temperature range is between 20-30°C. This is done as a method of temperature regulation for the colony. On battle day one, the temperature in group A's territory was 5°C. This is significantly lower than the temperature range mentioned in the article for creating more openings in the nest thatch. Additionally, the article states that workers will close openings in the nest thatch when the air humidity surrounding the nest decreases, in order to reduce water loss for the colony. Although battle day one does not specifically mention the air humidity levels, it is reasonable to assume that the lower temperature of 5°C would also result in a lower internal nest temperature, causing the ants to create fewer openings in the nest thatch to maintain warmth and prevent excessive cooling of the nest. Therefore, group A would likely have less openings in their nest thatch on battle day one."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Antoine's marriage to Marie of Lorraine was unhappy and yielded only two daughters. Monaco's constitution confined the throne to members of the Grimaldi family alone, and Antoine was thus keen for his daughter Princess Louise-Hippolyte (Illustration 11) to wed a Grimaldi cousin. However, the state of the Grimaldi fortunes, and the lack of (the politically necessary) approval from King Louis XIV, dictated otherwise. Louise-Hippolyte was married to Jacques de Goyon Matignon, a wealthy aristocrat from Normandy. Louise-Hippolyte succeeded her father as sovereign of Monaco in 1731 but died just months later. The King of France, confirming Monaco's subservient state to France, ignored the protests of other branches of the Grimaldi family, overthrew the Monégasque constitution, and approved the succession of Jacques de Goyon Matignon as Prince Jacques I.Jacques I assumed the name and arms of the Grimaldi, but the French aristocracy showed scant respect towards the new prince who had risen from their ranks and chose to spend his time absent from Monaco. He died in 1751 and was succeeded by his and Louise-Hippolyte's son Prince Honoré III.Honoré III married Catherine Brignole in 1757 and later divorced her. Before his marriage, Honoré III had been conducting an affair with his future mother-in-law.  After her divorce Marie Brignole married Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Condé, a member of the fallen French royal house, in 1798. Ironically, the Grimaldi fortunes were restored when descendants of both Hortense Mancini and Louis I married: Louise d'Aumont Mazarin married Honoré III's son and heir, the future Honoré IV. This marriage in 1776 was extremely advantageous to the Grimaldi, as Louise's ancestress Hortense Mancini had been the heiress of Cardinal Mazarin. Thus Monaco's ruling family acquired all the estates bequeathed by Cardinal Mazarin, including the Duchy of Rethel, and the Principality of Château-Porcien. Honoré III was a soldier who fought at both Fontenoy and Rocourt. He was happy to leave Monaco to be...

Read this: On 23 June 1757, the English East India Company defeated Siraj-ud-Daula, the Nawab of Bengal, in the Battle of Plassey. The British thus became masters of east India (Bengal, Bihar, Orissa) – a prosperous region with a flourishing agriculture, industry and trade. This led to a large amount of children being forced into labour due to the increasing need of cheap labour to produce large numbers of goods. Many multinationals often employed children because that they can be recruited for less pay, and have more endurance to utilise in factory environments. Another reason many Indian children were hired was because they lack knowledge of their basic rights, they did not cause trouble or complain, and they were often more trustworthy.

Throughout the course of the game, the Bears defense sacked Rams quarterback Sam Bradford six times, marking the first time the Bears defense has recorded at least five sacks in back-to-back games since the team's 2001 season. The six sacks increased the Bears season sack total to 14, which led the league, and is the most they have recorded in the first three games since 1987. On the offensive side, however, Jay Cutler completed only 17 of 31 passes for 183 yards and an interception (by Cortland Finnegan; Finnegan appeared to fumble on the return, and the ball was recovered by Bears receiver Devin Hester, but the fumble was overturned), and a mere passer rating of 58.9. With running back Matt Forte out for the game, the Bears rushing attack ran for 103 yards and Michael Bush ran for a 3-yard touchdown. In the second quarter, Rams kicker Greg Zuerlein kicked a 56-yard field goal, the longest in Soldier Field history. In the fourth quarter, Bears cornerback Tim Jennings deflected a Bradford pass intended for Danny Amendola to Major Wright, who returned the interception 45 yards for a touchdown. Based on the above article, answer a question. How many incomplete passes did Jay Cutler record?","output":"To determine the number of incomplete passes Jay Cutler recorded, we need to analyze the information given about his performance. We know that Jay Cutler completed 17 of 31 passes. To find out the number of incomplete passes, we can follow these steps: 1. Identify the total number of passes: 31 2.

Write a \\"negative\\" movie review (pick from the following.  - negative.  - positive.).","output":"Title: The Disappointing Delusion - A Review of \\"Dreamworld\\" After much anticipation and hype, \\"Dreamworld\\" finally made its way to theaters, and unfortunately, it has severely underwhelmed audiences, including me. What could have been an unforgettable cinematic experience turned out to be a forgettable and mediocre attempt. In this review, I will highlight the factors that make this movie a major letdown. First and foremost, the plot was aimless and completely lost its essence along the way. Although the concept of diving into a world where dreams and reality blend together was initially intriguing, the poor execution led to a convoluted and underwhelming narrative. There were too many loosely connected subplots instead of a single coherent storyline. This ultimately left me questioning the purpose of many scenes and feeling unfulfilled at the end. Secondly, the pacing was a complete disaster. Protracted scenes that failed to move the story forward turned the entire experience into a test of patience. The movie had moments where it would capture the right tone, only to drop it instantly during the next scene. With a runtime of over two and a half hours, I expected a richer, more meaningful story, instead the filmmakers dragged the audience through an endless maze of dream sequences that resulted in inertia instead of progression. Character development, or the lack thereof, was another disappointing aspect of the film. The protagonists, who at first showed promise, all suffered at the hands of the weak script and bland dialogues. Consequently, their motivations and decisions felt like mere plot devices rather than genuine human behavior. It was difficult to empathize with the characters, and the audience was left with no one to root for or connect with. The major redeeming factor of \\"Dreamworld\\" was its visuals. Indeed, the movie was visually stunning with impressive visual effects. However, dazzling visuals cannot compensate for the lack of substance, and this movie is a prime example of that. Lastly, the climax ended up being more chaotic than the thrilling showdown it could have been. By the time we reached the much-awaited conclusion, it was anti-climactic and felt rushed, leaving too many questions unanswered. It was evident that the filmmakers attempted to add a last-minute twist, but sadly, it added nothing to the overall story. In conclusion, \\"Dreamworld\\" was a major letdown that failed to live up to its potential. With a confusing plot, unengaging characters, and uneven pacing, it's distressing to see such a conceptually interesting idea fall flat. While the visuals are impressive, they do not make up for the overall disappointing experience. Sadly, I cannot recommend this movie."},{"instruction":"Possible answers:  (1). No.  (2). Yes.

ROCK AROUND THE BOX CD sets for stuffing outsize Xmas stockings Sunday, December 17th 2000, 2:15AM Deck the halls with bulky box sets ... Every year at this time, the music industry sends those fat, multi-CD compilations lumbering into stores, providing a godsend for otherwise stumped gift-givers. After 10 years of this trend, you'd think record companies would have strip-mined their entire back catalogues by now. This year, a new batch of top-line artists have sanctioned significant work in box-set form. Here are the most notable: All of Bowie's '70s changes warranted awe, but his most exciting period came early in the decade. The second disc from this triple-CD set clarifies the point by featuring dizzyingly fine live recordings cut for the BBC (or \\"Beeb\\") during 1972. Largely composed of songs from \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" and \\"Space Oddity,\\" the disc captures the peak of Bowie's most animated band, the Spiders From Mars, highlighted as it was by the fiery guitar work of the late Mick Ronson. Songs like \\"Hang on to Yourself\\" never sounded more frantic. The three chords of \\"Queen Bitch\\" swish with vintage glitter-rock flair. The disc includes smart covers of the Velvet Underground songs that helped inspire Bowie's chord changes: \\"White Light\\" and \\"Waiting for the Man.\\" Much less tightly focused, the first disc contains nascent BBC performances from 1968, before Bowie found his voice. The foppish, loungy songs here will appeal only to those with an encyclopedic interest in the star. You'll find far more verve on the third disc, cut this past June. Bowie's latest band downplays his recent forays into electronica to emphasize grandly arranged ballads of old, like \\"Wild as the Wind\\" and \\"Absolute Beginners,\\" not to mention elegant takes on songs like \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" and \\"The Man Who Sold the World.\\" If the Ziggy disc makes this set a must-buy, the third disc gives it something rare for a box set - a reason to cheer the artist's present as well as his past. LITTLE FEAT \\"HOTCAKES & OUTTAKES\\" (RHINO) Imagine combining the sensibility of a singer-songwriter with the chunky rhythms of funk. Mix in some country and blues and you've got the all-American formula Little Feat perfected during their '70s heyday. Led by the late Lowell George, Feat put out eight striking albums between 1970 and '81 without achieving more than cult status. You'll find the best of those records on the box set's first two discs, with highlights like the near-hit \\"Easy to Slip,\\" \\"Willin'\\" (later a radio staple for Linda Ronstadt) and \\"Dixie Chicken\\" (from which the Dixie Chicks took their name). Disc three features the incarnation of Little Feat that got together seven years after George's death, and proved that he was hardly their only strong foot. Writers like Bill Payne, Paul Barrere, Craig Fuller and Fred Tackett (who penned Bonnie Raitt's \\"Fool Yourself\\") continued to show their worth. The fourth CD culls the catacombs for outtakes, rarities and live cuts that should please fanatics. For everyone else, \\"Hotcakes\\" makes a great case for Little Feat as an American classic. LOS LOBOS \\"EL CANCIONERO - MAS Y MAS\\" (RHINO) Who could have imagined that any group could play traditional Mexican boleros, Cuban folk songs, American rockabilly, New Orleans blues, Southern R&B and cowboy rancheras with equal authority? Los Lobos stirred a deep melting pot of sounds from the start of their 25-year career, mixing scores of Spanish-speaking and Anglo genres. No wonder they're gods - second only to Santana - in the Latin rock movement. Los Lobos' four-CD set has to cover a wide field of recordings, since the band has appeared on so many soundtracks, tribute albums and compilations. \\"El Cancionero\\" does an admirable job of grazing the catalogue for highlights. The range of genres the group spans keeps the set from settling into sameness. Singer David Hidalgo's boyish passion ties it all together. The most wide-eyed pop singer since Steve Winwood, he has the angelic quality of a choirboy and enough depth to give soul to any style he tries. No guitarist since Jimi Hendrix played with more ruthless physicality than Vaughan. No wonder his guitar looked like a hurricane had hit it. In a way, one did. Like all guitarists who get sweaty and adventurous, Vaughan rarely played songs the same way twice, which makes this new box set of mainly rare live cuts as valuable as his prime studio recordings. Its three CDs include songs from an unreleased \\"MTV Unplugged,\\" an early cut with the band that came before the famed Double Trouble, and several numbers recorded at Alpine Valley just two days before the 1990 helicopter crash that took Vaughan's life. The gem, though, is a DVD capturing a never-released 30-minute 1989 performance for the TV show \\"Austin City Limits.\\" All the recordings prove one thing: While other guitarists may play as fast or as hard as Vaughan, few blessed with such virtuosic skills have played with as much heart. From their start in 1970, the Electric Light Orchestra specialized in rococo pop that overlaid their Beatlesque tunes with art-rock strings. As pomp-rockers, they were rivaled only by Queen. ELO put out its \\"Afterglow\\" box set 10 years ago, but it only included previously issued hits and suffered from pedestrian sound. To correct this, the group's leader, Jeff Lynne, oversaw this new set, adding seven unreleased tracks and digitally enhancing the quality to get the most out of his 10-layer-cake production. The spruced up sound of the new discs gives Lynne's dense tracks fresh definition. It's great to hear all the instrumentation clearly articulated on hits like \\"Strange Magic,\\" \\"Evil Woman\\" and \\"Livin' Thing.\\" The three new CDs collect not only all of ELO's main hits but also unearth cuts like Lynne's own take on \\"Xanadu\\" (which far outstrips Olivia Newton-John's hit version). Fans of flounce can't do better. Some teen idols have real talent. Take Rick Nelson. Music's very first telegenic rock star may have been signed for his pouty lips and pretty face, but he had an affectingly pure voice too. In the tradition of Buddy Holly, he made rockabilly innocent. Nelson's long-deserved box set, \\"Legacy,\\" goes a bit far in trying to shore up his reputation, which was strong with fellow musicians and critics but unproven with the public. Four CDs with more than a hundred tracks may be too much, especially since they include too many alternate versions of songs. Luckily, the highlights are high indeed. The early tracks on the first two CDs feature a great band, including guitarist James Burton (who later worked with Elvis). You'll find many of Nelson's best hits here, among them a version of \\"I'm Walkin'\\" cut when he was 16, \\"Lonesome Town\\" and \\"Hello Mary Lou.\\" You can hear how he influenced pop-leaning rockabilly stars like Chris Isaak and Dave Edmunds. The later CDs cover Nelson's shift into country and folk rock in the early '70s. They include his version of Dylan's \\"Love Minus Zero,\\" plus \\"Garden Party,\\" the cult classic about his inability to win an audience for his new music. In the 15 years since Nelson died in a plane crash, his stature has grown among the cognoscenti. The Backstreet Boys can only hope history will treat them so well. DION \\"KING OF THE NEW YORK STREETS\\" (CAPITOL) Dion is as associated with the vanished history of N.Y.C. as the Brooklyn Dodgers, egg creams and muggings. He captured the heart of New York while moving through at least three major phases, which are evenly traced on this three-CD set. The first one corrals his pompadour years, when he served as the original Fonzie (or sometimes Cunningham), with hits like \\"Teenager in Love,\\" \\"Runaround Sue\\" and \\"Donna the Prima Donna.\\" With his aching falsetto and strutting rockabilly chords, Dion DiMucci combined doo-wop with a singer-songwriter's personal angst. As the second CD shows, Dion reinvented himself as a folk artist, first with \\"Abraham, Martin & John\\" and later through his take on the period classic \\"The Dolphins\\" and the ruminative \\"Your Own Backyard.\\" Disc No. 3 has Dion morphing into a '70s-style singer-songwriter who turned his own history into myth. Ever the perfectionists, the Eagles would never think of putting anything as unfussy as outtakes on their box set. Nor would they let a song languish untouched in the studio long enough to become a rarity. This means that there's little new on this four-CD package. To lend some variety, they organized their catalogue into categories like \\"The Ballads\\" (CD No. 2) or \\"The Fast Lane\\" (the harder stuff, on CD 3). The first disc, \\"The Early Years,\\" contains hits like \\"Take It Easy\\" and \\"Already Gone.\\" The fourth offers 12 songs from the group's reunion show on Millennium Eve. The band's self-consciousness ensures that the live versions rarely sound different from the studio takes. Together, the set captures the band's limitations (its sexism, smugness and fake outsider status) as well as its strengths (perfect harmonies and fluid melodies). The Eagles may have lacked depth and humility, but they remain a model of pop craft. THE JIMI HENDRIX EXPERIENCE (MCA) Did Jimi Hendrix so much as burp without somebody recording it? This seems like the nine-zillionth box set issued under the guitar god's name. It yields 56 more unreleased recordings. Don't get the wrong idea. There is great stuff here, simply because it is Hendrix. So if your collection of the master's work is thin and you don't have any of the earlier box sets, you may want this one. But for those who have followed the story so far, only Hendrix fetishists will be able to tell the difference between some of these \\"alternate\\" performances and previous ones. If you really want to own a version of \\"Purple Haze\\" whose primary point of distinction is that it fades out instead of ends, you are more than welcome to it. While you're at it, you may also want to consider seeking professional help.

It is about 20 miles long and varies in width between two and a half and five miles, although the shingle Hurst Spit which projects one and a half miles into the Solent narrows the sea crossing between Hurst Castle and Colwell Bay to just over a mile.  - A shire is a traditional term for a division of land, found in the United Kingdom and Australia. It was first used in Wessex from the beginning of Anglo-Saxon settlement, and spread to most of the rest of England in the tenth century.  - The English Channel (\\"the Sleeve\\" [hence ] \\"Sea of Brittany\\" \\"British Sea\\"), also called simply the Channel, is the body of water that separates southern England from northern France, and joins the southern part of the North Sea to the rest of the Atlantic Ocean.  - The Isle of Wight is a county and the largest and second-most populous island in England. It is located in the English Channel, about 4 miles (6 km) off the coast of Hampshire, separated by the Solent. The island has resorts that have been holiday destinations since Victorian times, and is known for its mild climate, coastal scenery, and verdant landscape of fields, downland and chines.  - A chine is a steep-sided river valley where the river flows to the sea through, typically, soft eroding coastal cliffs of sandstone or clays. The word is still in use in central Southern Englandnotably in East Devon, Dorset, Hampshire and the Isle of Wightto describe such topographical features.

BMX bicycle races are sprint races on purpose-built off-road single-lap race tracks. The track usually consists of a starting gate for up to eight racers, a groomed, serpentine, dirt race course made of various jumps and rollers and a finish line. The course is usually flat, about wide and has large banked corners that help the riders maintain speed.  The sport of BMX racing is facilitated by a number of regional and international sanctioning bodies. They provide rules for sanctioning the conduct of the flying, specify age group and skill-level classifications among the racers, and maintain some kind of points-accumulation system over the racing season. The sport is very family oriented and largely participant-driven, with riders ranging in age from 2 to 70, and over. Professional ranks exist for both men and women, where the age ranges from 18 to 40 years old.  - Motocross is a form of off-road motorcycle racing held on enclosed off-road circuits. The sport evolved from motorcycle trials competitions held in the United Kingdom.  - BMX, an abbreviation for bicycle motocross, is a cycle sport performed on BMX bikes, either in competitive BMX racing or freestyle BMX, or else in general on- or off-road recreation.

GOP foreign policy elites don’t know whether they’ll serve if Trump is president When the Republican foreign policy elite gets together these days, conversation quickly veers from challenges such as the Islamic State or North Korea to focus on two questions. How has Donald Trump come so close to becoming the party’s standard-bearer? If Trump were elected president, would any of them serve in his administration? “It’s the only thing we can talk about,” said Eliot Cohen, professor of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins University and a former George W. Bush administration official. He’s answered the second question by spearheading an anti-Trump petition, which now has signatures of 121 GOP national security experts. Others are not sure how they would respond to a call from Trump. “Leaving any particular president completely alone and bereft from the best advice people could give him just doesn’t sound responsible,” said another former senior Republican official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “I would never say never, but it’s hard to envision myself,” the former official said. Many of Trump’s foreign policy pronouncements — retreating from NATO, targeting the families of terror suspects and tearing up existing trade deals, among others — are anathema to the Republican national security mainstream. In any case, the former official said, “I haven’t been asked.” Listen to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump discuss some of his foreign policy positions with The Washington Post editorial board. “NATO is costing us a fortune,” Trump said. “We’re not reimbursed fairly for what we do.” (The Washington Post) Trump, who has cited himself as his primary foreign policy adviser, has announced eight team members so far, one of whom has discrepancies on his résumé. George Papadopoulous, a 2009 graduate of DePaul University, has described himself in several lengthy published résumés as an oil and gas consultant and expert in eastern Mediterranean energy policy. But his claim to have served for several years as a fellow at the Washington-based Hudson Institute was refuted by David Tell, Hudson senior fellow and director of public affairs, who said the institute’s “records indicate that Mr. Papadopoulos started here as an unpaid intern in 2011 and subsequently provided some contractual research assistance to one of our senior fellows.” Papadopoulos also lists attendance as “U.S. Representative at the 2012 Geneva International Model United Nations.” Two people who were part of the delegation that year, including Antony Papadopoulos (no relation), current secretary general of the Geneva program, said they had no recollection of him being there. He also cites the delivery of a keynote address at the 2008 annual American Hellenic Institute Foundation Conference. The conference agenda that year noted Papadopoulos’s participation on a youth panel with other students; it lists 1988 Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis as the keynote speaker. Asked via his LinkedIn account about these discrepancies, Papadopoulos initially replied with a question. “Is it true that the ‘establishment GOP foreign policy advisers,’ many of whom I’ve met, are confused why the presidential front runner chose a group of experts with regional, on the ground experience, with track records of getting deals done with governments, instead of relying on their failed policies they likely devised at Starbucks on Pennsylvania Ave? If so, I am very shocked.” He referred subsequent emailed questions about the discrepancies, how he met Trump, what he admires in the candidate’s foreign policy vision and what he would like to achieve in a Trump administration to campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks. Trump does not appear to have cast a wide net so far. Of the eight team members Trump has announced, four have a military background. They include retired Army Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, retired Maj. Gen. Gary Harrell, retired Rear Adm. Chuck Kubic and reserve Maj. Gen. Bert Mizusawa. Other members of the team include Carter Page, who heads a New York-based energy investment firm. Walid Phares, a Maronite Christian who was a political adviser to Lebanese militants during their war against Muslim factions during the 1980s, is a regular Fox News commentator on terrorism. Another team member, Joseph Schmitz, was the controversial inspector general at the Defense Department from 2002 to 2005. He later spent three years as a senior official at the Prince Group, the parent company of the security firm Blackwater. Trump has also named Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a lawmaker not known for his interest or experience in foreign policy, as his national security coordinator. A source close to former CIA head and retired Gen. David Petraeus said that a Trump emissary had tried to set up a meeting between them early this year, but it has yet to take place. Some of those Trump has mentioned with admiration have denied they are on his team. Asked last month if the respect Trump voiced for him was mutual, Council on Foreign Relations President Richard Haass told NPR that he had briefed Trump, among other candidates, once last year and said, “I simply don’t know him well enough to give you that kind of judgment.” On April 1, Trump’s foreign policy team held its first group meeting with the candidate at the Washington construction site where a hotel bearing his name will soon open. One way to judge a candidate is by the company they keep, although the size of the team and timing of its announcement can vary widely. Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state, has assembled a foreign policy cast of hundreds, while Bernie Sanders has not yet announced a formal team. On the Republican side, Jeb Bush released a list of 21 foreign policy advisers in early 2015, months before he even declared he was running for the presidency. By contrast, Marco Rubio announced his own list of 18 advisers (including Cohen) just a week before he withdrew from the race last month. But in both cases, the choices were virtually all former senior officials in previous Republican administrations, and the message they sought to impart was the same. Experience, stability, no surprises. Four from Bush’s campaign, which ended in late February, signed on with Rubio. John Kasich’s hefty list of 39 national security advisers, released in February, is a mix of former officials, experts and academics, and former lawmakers, most of whom would be considered moderates in the heated GOP atmosphere. In mid-March, Ted Cruz announced a 23-member “national security coalition.” About one-quarter are former mid-level Republican officials. Others range from retired Lt. Gen. William G. Boykin, president of the conservative Family Research Council, to former Missouri senator Jim Talent, who served as an adviser to Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s campaign before Walker became an early primary dropout. Only in the case of Trump have significant numbers of former officials and retired military officers publicly declared they would never work for him. In addition to Cohen’s petition, a separate group of retired officers and prominent members of prior GOP administrations have called on the military to disobey orders to torture captured suspected terrorists or target their families. Trump “is a massive outlier,” said Mark Dubowitz, executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, an officially nonpartisan antiterrorism think tank where many Republicans have found an out-of-office home. But beyond those who have said they would never work for Trump, “there are hundreds and hundreds left who have stayed silent.” For many, he said, self-interest may triumph over ideology if and when it becomes clear Trump will be the GOP nominee. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The Republican foreign policy elite are concerned about the prospect of serving under a potential Donald Trump presidency, given that his foreign policy pronouncements, such as retreating from NATO, targeting the families of terror suspects, and tearing up existing trade deals, are contrary to the Republican national security mainstream.

Input: Passage: In 1979, the locomotive was renumbered \\"1881\\", painted black with silver stripes, and leased to a Hollywood company for use in the filming of the horror movie Terror Train (1979), starring Jamie Lee Curtis. In 1980, the locomotive was repainted with a color scheme used by Canadian Pacific in the 1930s.  The black, gold, and Tuscan red paint job was popular with railroad enthusiasts and photographers.  The number 1293 was also restored to the engine.  In February 1982, the headlights, handrails, and cab roof of 1293 were damaged when the roof of a Steamtown storage building gave way to heavy snow.Although the Steamtown Special History Study reasoned that, since this type of locomotive had historically operated in New England, perhaps as far south as Boston, it qualified to be part of the federal government's collection, the Canadian native sat unused for 12 years following the move to Scranton. Ohio Central Railroad System purchased it in 1996, and it underwent a 13-month restoration.  As of July 2010, Ohio Central Railroad has lost control of most of its holdings, but former owner, Jerry Joe Jacobson, maintained a collection of vintage equipment including CPR 1293 and her sister, CRP 1278, which is also a veteran of Steamtown, U.S.A. operational locomotives. No. 1293 is still operational as of October 2011.Canadian Pacific Railway No. 1278, like her sister, CPR 1293, was also built by Canadian Locomotive Company in 1948, and is a type 4-6-2, class G5d light-weight \\"Pacific\\" locomotive.  It was purchased by Blount in May 1965, and renumbered 127.  Blount had planned to renumber all three of the series 1200 CRP locomotives in his collection from 1246, 1278, and 1293 to 124, 127 and 129 respectively, but 1278 was the only one of the three that underwent the change.  The new number remained on the locomotive from 1966 until 1973, when its former number was restored.  The locomotive was leased to the Cadillac and Lake City Railroad in Michigan from 1970 to 1971.  After some repair work, the locomotive was returned to Bellows Falls where it served on excursion runs. After moving to Scranton, CPR 1278 was traded to the Gettysburg Steam Railroad in Pennsylvania.  Question: What company was the locomotive that was leased to a railroad in Michigan traded to after serving in Bellows Falls and Scranton?

Q: what is the fourth amendment in the bill of rights? A:","output":"The Fourth Amendment in the Bill of Rights is an essential component of the United States Constitution that protects citizens from unreasonable searches and seizures as well as ensuring the right to privacy. Ratified on December 15, 1791, as part of the first ten amendments, the Bill of Rights aimed to safeguard individual liberties and limit government powers. The Fourth Amendment, in particular, stands as a bulwark against potential abuses of power by government authorities. The text of the Fourth Amendment reads as follows: \\"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\\" The importance of the Fourth Amendment arises from its intent to strike a balance between individuals' rights to privacy and the necessity for law enforcement to investigate and prevent crime. This amendment protects citizens from arbitrary intrusion by the government into their private lives, ensuring that searches and seizures can only be conducted if specific conditions are met. Firstly, the Fourth Amendment mandates that searches and seizures must be based on \\"probable cause.\\" Probable cause refers to a reasonable belief that a crime has been or is being committed, and that evidence of the crime can be found in the location to be searched. This standard prevents law enforcement officers from conducting searches on a whim or based on personal biases. Secondly, the amendment requires that searches and seizures must be supported by a warrant. A warrant is a legal document issued by a judge or magistrate, authorizing law enforcement to conduct a search or seizure. The warrant process provides an additional layer of protection for citizens, as it ensures that an impartial third party – a judge – evaluates whether probable cause exists before authorizing the search or seizure. Lastly, the Fourth Amendment specifies that the warrant must \\"particularly describe the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\\" This requirement prevents overly broad or general warrants and ensures that law enforcement officers cannot exceed the scope of the warrant when conducting a search or seizure. Over time, the Supreme Court has developed and refined the application of the Fourth Amendment through various landmark cases. The Court's interpretation has extended the amendment's protections to apply not only to physical searches and seizures but also to electronic surveillance and interception of communications. The Court has also established the \\"exclusionary rule,\\" which prohibits the use of evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment in criminal trials. In conclusion, the Fourth Amendment plays a crucial role in protecting citizens' rights to privacy and guarding against abuses of power by government officials. It has evolved over time to adapt to changing technologies and societal expectations, while preserving the essential balance between individual liberties and public safety. By promoting judicial oversight, requiring probable cause, and specifying the nature of searches and seizures, the Fourth Amendment remains a central pillar of individual freedom and the rule of law."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Just as the stock market rises and falls in response to what people are willing to put their money behind, we have inside ourselves an inner economy that rises and falls in response to our beliefs about what is possible. Sometimes the degree to which we are willing to challenge our belief systems determines the success of our inner economy. For example, imagine that your family of origin had a belief that musical talent was not something they possessed. As a member of that group, you would likely inherit   that same belief about yourself. As a result, even if you had a great desire to create music, you might be hesitant to really get behind yourself, fearing that your investment would not pay off. Even if you had the courage to follow your passion, your inner belief that you are not inherently talented would probably be a major drawback to investing your energy in your dream. On the other hand, if you found a way to release that negative belief, a great flood of energy would pour forth, greatly increasing the likelihood of your success. How much energy we are willing to invest in the various ideas, dreams, and visions we carry within is like the money people are, or are not, willing to invest in the various products available for trade on the stock market. And in both cases, belief plays a key role in determining how willing we are to get behind something. One way to open up the possibility for greater success in our inner economies is to understand that belief is not the reliable guide we sometimes think. There are other more reliable things of success that we can put our faith in, such as passion, feeling, and sense. Some of the most successful investors in the stock market are the ones that go against the grain (to be something that one does not like doing), trusting their sense over the common opinion held by common people about what will work. In the same way, we can learn to trust our heart's desires and our sense to guide us, questioning any beliefs that stand in the way of our ability to fully invest...

Then Danish TV dramas \\"The Killing\\" and \\"Borgen\\" captured the imagination of a worldwide audience. And now designers Malene Birger, Ivan Grundahl and a new generation coming up behind them are taking the international fashion scene by storm. \\"Wonderful, wonderful Copenhagen,\\" trilled Danny Kaye in his movie portrayal of Denmark's famous fairytale author, Hans Christian Andersen. And it is wonderful -- though there's a lot more to the Danish capital than the beautiful little harbor surrounded by quaint townhouses that drew Andersen to the city nearly 200 years ago.

Q:I can use this background: A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil.  Now, I have a new situation: Two gardeners started their planting season at the same time. Bill used mycorrizal fungi compost for the garden, while Hank used regular top soil. Bill was very happy with the harvest.  Answer this question please: Which gardener observed more improved mineral nutrient absorption from the soil? A:","output":"Bill, the gardener who used mycorrhizal fungi compost for his garden, likely observed more improved mineral nutrient absorption from the soil.  Step 1: Understand the background information. - Mycorrhizal fungi form symbiotic relationships with plant roots, improving water and mineral nutrient absorption. Step 2: Determine what was used in each gardener's garden. - Bill used mycorrhizal fungi compost. - Hank used regular top soil. Step 3: Compare the two gardeners' planting methods. - Bill's use of mycorrhizal fungi compost would have introduced the beneficial fungi to his plants' roots, resulting in improved nutrient absorption. - Hank's use of regular top soil may not have provided the same benefits as the mycorrhizal fungi compost. Step 4: Conclude which gardener observed more improved mineral nutrient absorption from the soil. - Since Bill used mycorrhizal fungi compost and Hank used regular top soil, it is likely that Bill observed more improved mineral nutrient absorption from the soil due to the presence of the beneficial fungi. This likely contributed to his happiness with the harvest."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What are the first names of the people who live in the house that Paul infiltrates?  In 1955 in Portland, Oregon, a businessman finds his wife in bed with another man, and commits a double murder-suicide. His young son, Paul, witnesses the three deaths, and is traumatized. Twenty-five years later, in 1980, Paul is incarcerated at a psychiatric institution near Stanford Bay, a small town on the Oregon Coast. One day, Paul manages to murder an orderly, and subsequently retrieves a beloved wooden flute given to him by his father before escaping the institution. Local teenager Marion is struggling to adjust to her disability—she survived a car accident several years prior, caused by her drunken father Frank, which left her unable to walk without the help of a leg brace. She is plagued by bizarre dreams, which she comes to discover are in fact premonitions; while in the hospital after her accident, she received a blood transfusion from Paul, which has given her extrasensory perception into Paul's actions. Marion's home life is troubled, with her father being verbally abusive to her and her mother, Bea, and she dreams of leaving Stanford Bay once her fisherman boyfriend, Joey, obtains a job in Portland. Meanwhile, Paul hitchhikes with a truck driver whom he bludgeons to death with a hatchet, and then steals his vehicle. He subsequently picks up a female hitchhiker, who he brings to a local motel in Stanford Bay, and murders her after failing to charm her with his flute-playing. Marion's psychic visions of Paul's murders increase in frequency and intensity, and sh soon witnesses him in person disposing of a body on a rural beach, making her his next target. Marion manages to elude to Paul, but he later discovers where she lives, and infiltrates her home, killing Frank. Struggling to walk, Marion manages to flee her home to an adjacent sawmill, and is pursued by Paul. While chasing Marion, Paul impales a worker with a forklift, and then inadvertently crashes through a barrier, driving the forklift off the pier and into the bay.

This is some data: Giraffe eatType coffee shop; Giraffe priceRange moderate; Giraffe customer rating 1 out of 5; Giraffe familyFriendly yes; Giraffe near The Bakers. Generate a detailed description of this data.","output":"Giraffe is a coffee shop with distinct attributes and evaluation based on the given data. The information provided outlines several aspects such as the type of establishment, price range, customer rating, family-friendliness, and its location in relation to other nearby businesses. Here is an in-depth analysis of the data presented: 1. Establishment Type: The data reveals that Giraffe is a coffee shop. As a coffee shop, customers can expect a casual and relaxed atmosphere where they can enjoy a variety of caffeinated beverages, as well as an assortment of light snacks, pastries, and possibly small meal options. The establishment likely focuses on serving high-quality coffee while providing a cozy and welcoming environment for customers to socialize, work, or unwind. 2. Price Range: The price range for Giraffe is described as moderate, meaning that the costs of items on the menu are neither too low nor too high. This suggests that Giraffe aims to cater to a broad customer base, offering reasonably priced food and drinks that most individuals can afford. Customers visiting Giraffe can anticipate spending an average amount, as compared to other nearby coffee shops, for their purchases. 3. Customer Rating: Giraffe has a customer rating of 1 out of 5, which is a notably low score. This indicates that the overall customer satisfaction for the establishment is poor. This low rating may stem from factors such as subpar quality of products offered, inadequate service or ambience, uncleanliness, or any combination of these and other potential issues. Prospective visitors might approach the coffee shop with caution, as its reputation could be viewed as questionable due to this negative feedback. 4. Family-Friendly: The data specifies that Giraffe is family-friendly, which implies that it is suitable and welcoming for customers of all age groups, including children. This characteristic also suggests that the establishment may offer additional amenities to cater to families, such as a kid-friendly menu, high chairs, or even a dedicated play area. The family-friendly nature of the coffee shop makes it an ideal destination for parents with children, as well as for gatherings of friends or relatives. 5. Nearby Location: Giraffe is located near a business called The Bakers. This could be a bakery, signifying that the area may be populated by other establishments centered around food and beverages. This neighboring location might be either beneficial or detrimental to Giraffe. On one hand, being close to a bakery could mean increased foot traffic and potential customers due to the shared target audience. On the other hand, this might also lead to increased competition for Giraffe, as customers might choose to visit The Bakers or other nearby food establishments that could offer compelling alternatives. In summary, Giraffe is a family-friendly coffee shop with a moderate price range, situated near a business called The Bakers. It possesses a disappointingly low customer rating of 1 out of 5, which is a critical aspect that requires further investigation and potentially some improvements on Giraffe's part to enhance its reputation and overall customer experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Information:  - Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla.  - Catalonia is an autonomous community of Spain, located on the northeastern extremity of the Iberian Peninsula. It is designated as a \\"nationality\\" by its Statute of Autonomy. Catalonia consists of four provinces: Barcelona, Girona, Lleida, and Tarragona. The capital and largest city is Barcelona, the second-most populated municipality in Spain and the core of the seventh-most populous urban area in the European Union.  - Generalitat (, literally in English 'Generality') is the name of the systems of government of two of the present Spanish autonomous communities: Catalonia and Valencia. The term is also used for the government of the semi-autonomous \\"comarca\\" of Val d'Aran, the \\"Generalitat a l'Aran\\".  - The functions of the President of the Generalitat de Catalunya have varied considerably over history , in parallel with the attributions of the Generalitat itself .  - The Parliament of Catalonia is the unicameral legislature of Catalonia (autonomous community of Spain). It is formed by 135 members (\\"diputats\\"), who are elected every four years or after extraordinary dissolution, chosen by universal suffrage in lists with four constituencies, the Catalan provinces. The Parliament building is located in Ciutadella park, Barcelona.  - The Government of Catalonia or Generalitat de Catalunya (Catalan ) is the institution under which the autonomous community of Catalonia in Spain is politically organised. It consists of the Parliament of Catalonia, the President of the Generalitat de Catalunya and the Government of Catalonia.    What is the relationship between 'list of presidents of the generalitat de catalunya' and 'catalonia'?","output":"The relationship between the 'list of presidents of the Generalitat de Catalunya' and 'Catalonia' lies in the political governance system of Catalonia, an autonomous community in Spain. The list of presidents of the Generalitat de Catalunya refers to the individuals who have held the position of President in Catalonia's regional government, known as the Generalitat de Catalunya. Catalonia has a unique system of government within the Spanish framework and is designated as a \\"nationality\\" by its Statute of Autonomy. This autonomous status grants it a certain level of self-governance, allowing the region to have its institutions, such as the Parliament of Catalonia and the Generalitat de Catalunya. The President of the Generalitat de Catalunya serves as the head of the regional government and is elected by the Parliament of Catalonia. Their functions and attributions have evolved throughout history, alongside the Generalitat's attributions. The President plays a critical role in representing the Catalan government, managing the region's affairs, proposing regional legislation, and appointing members of the government's executive branch. Thus, the relationship between the list of presidents of the Generalitat de Catalunya and Catalonia is intrinsically linked to the region's autonomous political system.

Translate to English","output":"In any case, however, decisive measures must be taken within weeks or at most months to prevent the next round of bloody conflicts from breaking out in Afghanistan. The situation in Afghanistan is critical, and the urgency of taking immediate and decisive actions cannot be overstated. The aim of these measures should be to stabilize the country, provide support to its government and people, and prevent further escalation of violence and instability. There are several key steps that should be taken in the short term to address this crisis: 1. Diplomatic engagement: International and regional powers, such as the United States, China, Russia, Iran, and Pakistan, have an important role to play in resolving the current crisis. Concerted diplomatic efforts must be made to encourage dialogue between the Afghan government, the Taliban, and other warring factions. This should involve the establishment of a framework for negotiations and confidence-building measures. 2. Security assistance: Strengthening the Afghan security forces should be a priority to ensure that they can confront the different factions and maintain control over key parts of the country. This can be achieved by providing training, equipment, and financial support to the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF). Additionally, international peacekeeping forces may need to remain in the country for a longer period to support the ANSF and maintain security. 3. Humanitarian aid and development cooperation: The Afghan population suffers from endemic poverty, high unemployment, and limited access to essential services, such as healthcare and education. Improving the living conditions of Afghans should be a key aspect of the international community's engagement in the country. Providing humanitarian aid, facilitating the delivery of essential services, and promoting socioeconomic development should be integral components of these efforts. 4. Counter-terrorism cooperation: Afghanistan remains a breeding ground for extremist groups, such as the Islamic State. International cooperation should be reinforced to share intelligence, disrupt terrorist networks, and prevent the spread of these threats beyond Afghanistan's border. This will require close collaboration between different actors, including law enforcement agencies, intelligence services, and the military. 5. Addressing the drug trafficking problem: Afghanistan is the world's largest producer of opium, which fuels instability across the country and the region. Tackling this issue is crucial in order to undermine the funding sources of terrorist organizations and restore peace in Afghanistan. A comprehensive, long-term strategy is required, beginning with measures to disrupt drug production and traffic, followed by efforts to promote alternative livelihoods for Afghan farmers. By implementing these steps, the international community will be better placed to prevent the outbreak of another bloody conflict in Afghanistan. The goal should be a stable, secure, and prosperous Afghanistan that can provide safety and economic opportunities for its citizens while contributing to regional peace and stability.

She welcomed how the role \\"keeps me visible [and] keeps me extremely well informed on the issues.\\"  At the start of 1998, Ferraro left Crossfire and ran for the Democratic nomination again in the 1998 United States Senate election in New York. The other candidates were Congressman Charles Schumer and New York City Public Advocate Mark J. Green. She had done no fundraising, out of fear of conflict of interest with her Crossfire job, but was nonetheless immediately perceived as the front-runner. Indeed, December and January polls had her 25 percentage points ahead of Green in the race and even further ahead of Schumer. Unlike the previous campaigns, her family finances never became an issue. However, she lost ground during the summer, with Schumer catching up in the polls by early August and then soon passing her. Schumer, a tireless fundraiser, outspent her by a five-to-one margin, and Ferraro failed to establish a political image current with the times. In the September 15, 1998 primary, she was beaten soundly by Schumer by a 51 percent to 26 percent margin. Unlike 1992, the contest was not divisive, and Ferraro and third-place finisher Green endorsed Schumer at a unity breakfast the following day. Schumer would go on to decisively unseat D'Amato in the general election.  The 1998 primary defeat brought an end to Ferraro's political career. The New York Times wrote at the time: \\"If Ms. Ferraro's rise was meteoric, her political career's denouement was protracted, often agonizing and, at first glance, baffling.\\" She still retained admirers, though. Anita Perez Ferguson, president of the National Women's Political Caucus, noted that female New York political figures in the past had been reluctant to enter the state's notoriously fierce primary races, and said: \\"This woman has probably been more of an opinion maker than most people sitting for six terms straight in the House of Representatives or Senate. Her attempts, and even her losses, have accomplished far beyond what others have accomplished by winning.\\" Was she popular on CNN?","output":"Yes, Geraldine Ferraro was popular on CNN during her tenure as a co-host on the political talk show Crossfire. Her background as a prosecutor, combined with her quick and sharp communication style, New York accent, and ability to spar effectively with co-host Pat Buchanan, made her a strong presence on the show. As a result, Crossfire maintained strong ratings for CNN and became a lucrative job for her. Ferraro's role on the show not only kept her visible in the public eye but also allowed her to stay well informed on various political issues. Despite her political career ending after losing the 1998 Democratic primary for the United States Senate election in New York, Ferraro continued to be a respected and influential figure in politics. Her time on CNN's Crossfire was a significant part of her career and contributed to her visibility and popularity among viewers."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Pascal Cotte said he has spent more than 10 years using the technology to analyse the painting. He claims the earlier portrait lies hidden underneath the surface of Leonardo's most celebrated artwork. A reconstruction shows another image of a sitter looking off to the side. The Louvre Museum has declined to comment on his claims because it \\"was not part of the scientific team\\". Instead of the famous, direct gaze of the painting which hangs in the Louvre Museum in Paris, the image of the sitter also shows no trace of her enigmatic smile, which has intrigued art lovers for more than 500 years. But Mr Cotte's claims are controversial and have divided opinion among Leonardo experts. Will Gompertz, Arts Editor I'm sceptical. It's perfectly common for an artist to overpaint an image as it is for a client who's commissioned that artist to ask for changes. So it's not surprising that there are those underpaintings on the Mona Lisa. The data that the technology generates is open to interpretation, which needs to be analysed and corroborated by the academic and curatorial community, and not just an individual. I think the Louvre's decision not to make a comment is telling. This is the world's most famous painting which, like a celebrity, always makes for a good story. But in this case I think caution is required. The scientist, who is the co-founder of Lumiere Technology in Paris, was given access to the painting in 2004 by the Louvre. He has pioneered a technique called Layer Amplification Method (LAM), which he used to analyse the Mona Lisa. It works by \\"projecting a series of intense lights\\" on to the painting, Mr Cotte said.  A camera then takes measurements of the lights' reflections and from those measurements, Mr Cotte said he is able to reconstruct what has happened between the layers of the paint. The Mona Lisa has been the subject of several scientific examinations over more than half a century. More recent techniques include infrared inspections and multi-spectral scanning. But Mr Cotte has claimed his technique is able to penetrate more deeply into the painting. He said:  \\"We can now analyse exactly what is happening inside the layers of the paint and we can peel like an onion all the layers of the painting. We can reconstruct all the chronology of the creation of the painting.\\" Leonardo is believed to have worked on the painting between 1503 and 1517 while working in Florence and later in France. There has long been debate about the Mona Lisa's identity.  But for centuries, it has been widely believed that she is Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a Florentine silk merchant. But Mr Cotte has claimed his discoveries challenge that theory.  He believes the image he has reconstructed underneath the surface of the painting is Leonardo's original Lisa, and that the portrait named Mona Lisa for more than 500 years is, in fact, a different woman. He said:  \\"The results shatter many myths and alter our vision of Leonardo's masterpiece forever. \\"When I finished the reconstruction of Lisa Gherardini, I was in front of the portrait and she is totally different to Mona Lisa today.  This is not the same woman.\\" He also claims to have found two more images under the surface of the painting - a shadowy outline of a portrait with a larger head and nose, bigger hands but smaller lips.  And he says he has found another Madonna-style image with Leonardo's etchings of a pearl headdress. But Martin Kemp, Emeritus Professor of the History of Art at the University of Oxford, is not convinced. Professor Kemp said:  \\"They [Cotte's images] are ingenious in showing what Leonardo may have been thinking about.  But the idea that there is that picture as it were hiding underneath the surface is untenable. \\"I do not think there are these discrete stages which represent different portraits.  I see it as more or less a continuous process of evolution.  I am absolutely convinced that the Mona Lisa is Lisa. \\" Art historian Andrew Graham-Dixon has made a new BBC documentary called The Secrets of the Mona Lisa, studying historical documents linked to the painting alongside Mr Cotte's scientific findings. Mr Graham-Dixon said:  \\"I have no doubt that this is definitely one of the stories of the century. \\"There will probably be some reluctance on the part of the authorities at the Louvre in changing the title of the painting because that's what we're talking about - it's goodbye Mona Lisa, she is somebody else.\\" Mr Cotte announced the findings of his latest research at a press conference in Shanghai on Tuesday. They will be included in an exhibition,  Da Vinci - The Genius, which features displays of his research on the Mona Lisa over the last 11 years. The show has travelled around the world and opens in Shanghai this week. The Secrets of the Mona Lisa is on BBC Two at 21:00 GMT on 9 December.

In humans, the middle ear works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In whales, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, whales receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The whale ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater. Odontocetes send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. The melon size varies between species, the bigger the more dependent they are of it. A beaked whale for example has a small bulge sitting on top of its skull, whereas a sperm whale's head is filled up mainly with the melon.The whale eye is relatively small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, the eyes of a whale are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When belugas surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; they contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light, but they have far more rod cells than they do cone cells. Whales do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for colour vision than most mammals.

A year after dumping Roger Federer out of the second round at Wimbledon he sent Ernests Gulbis packing at the same stage. The world No 86 perhaps thought a posting on court 12 might keep him below the radar. But matches involving Gulbis are rarely quiet. And upsetting the 12th seed ensures he will inflate his reputation so long as he keeps his footing on grass. This was a performance of domination, a sustained beating that rarely, if ever, looked like letting up. He ultimately saw off the Latvian 6-4, 6-3, 7-6. Throwback: Stakhovsky celebrating his victory over","output":"Roger Federer in the second round at Wimbledon in 2013. Ukrainian tennis player Sergiy Stakhovsky has earned a reputation for causing upsets on the grand stage, particularly at Wimbledon. Following his shock victory over Roger Federer in the second round in 2013, he once again caused a stir by defeating 12th seed Ernests Gulbis in the second round at the All England Club in 2014. Stakhovsky, who was ranked No. 86 in the world at the time, may have believed that playing on the less prominent Court 12 would help him avoid too much attention. However, matches featuring the enigmatic Gulbis are seldom uneventful, and the Ukrainian's victory only served to further enhance his burgeoning reputation, especially when it comes to performing on grass courts. Throughout the match, Stakhovsky appeared to be in complete control, dominating his higher-ranked opponent in a display of powerful and aggressive tennis. Gulbis, known for his mercurial talent and often fiery temperament, struggled to find his rhythm and was unable to counter the relentless pressure applied by Stakhovsky. The final score read 6-4, 6-3, 7-6 in the Ukrainian's favor, in what many considered a significant upset. Stakhovsky's success in toppling top-ranked players at Wimbledon highlights his ability to rise to the occasion on the sport's biggest stages. His fearlessness and determination, combined with his undeniable natural talent, make him a dangerous opponent, particularly in the early rounds of Grand Slam events when higher-ranked players may still be finding their form. Gulbis, on the other hand, demonstrated that despite his immense natural ability and impressive shot-making skills, consistency and mental fortitude remain areas of concern in his game. While undoubtedly a gifted player, the Latvian's inability to maintain focus and perform at his best during crunch moments has often cost him dearly when it matters most. This match served as a clear reminder of the unpredictability of tennis. On any given day, a lower-ranked player can overcome a more established rival, particularly in Grand Slam events where the pressure and intensity can be overwhelming. Stakhovsky's victory over Gulbis, much like his famous win against Federer the year before, proved that there are no guaranteed victories in tennis, and every match must be approached with the utmost concentration and commitment. In conclusion, Sergiy Stakhovsky's 2014 Wimbledon second-round victory over Ernests Gulbis was yet another example of the Ukrainian's ability to cause major upsets in Grand Slam tournaments. His fearless and aggressive style of play, combined with a never-say-die attitude, make him a formidable opponent, particularly on grass courts. Meanwhile, Gulbis must continue to work on maintaining consistency and mental strength if he is to deliver on his immense potential and challenge for major honors in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: – More big trouble for Sears: The retailing giant plans to close another 72 stores as sales plunge and losses grow. The beleaguered retailer said that it has identified about 100 stores that are no longer turning a profit, and the majority of those locations will be shuttered soon. The company said it would post of a list of the stores to close later on Thursday, reports the Wall Street Journal. Sears lost 424 million, or 3.93 per share, for the period ended May 5, per the AP. Revenue tumbled more than 30%, with store closings already underway contributing to almost two thirds of the decline. Sales at stores open at least a year, a key gauge of a retailer's health, tumbled 11.9%. The one-time powerhouse retailer that survived two world wars and the Great Depression has been calving off pieces of itself as it burns through money. Kenmore, the retailer's appliance brand, became the latest potential sale after ESL Investments, the company's largest shareholder, headed by Sears Chairman and CEO Edward Lampert, said it might be interested in buying it. Lampert, who combined Sears and Kmart in 2005 after helping to bring the latter out of bankruptcy, has long pledged to save the famed retailer, which started in the 1880s as a mail-order catalog business. Article:","output":"Title: Sears Plans to Close 72 Stores as Retail Giant's Sales and Losses Grow Sears, the once-powerhouse retailer, has announced plans to close another 72 stores as it continues to struggle with plummeting sales and growing losses. The company has identified approximately 100 stores that are no longer profitable, and the majority of these will be closed soon, according to a Wall Street Journal report. The closure of these stores is the latest indication of the woes that have plagued Sears for years, as it fails to maintain a presence in the challenging retail landscape. Sears reported a loss of 424 million, or 3.93 per share, for the period ended May 5. Revenue declined by more than 30%, with store closings already underway contributing to nearly two-thirds of this decline. Sales at stores open for at least a year, an important metric for a retailer's health, plunged 11.9%. These losses come even as the company has been selling off and divesting assets in an effort to stay afloat. Sears once thrived as a powerhouse retailer, surviving two world wars and the Great Depression. It began in the 1880s as a mail-order catalog business and became a cornerstone of American retail. In 2005, the company merged with Kmart under the leadership of Edward Lampert, CEO and chairman of Sears as well as the founder of ESL Investments, Sears' largest shareholder. At the time, Kmart was coming out of bankruptcy, and Lampert promised to save the storied brand. Despite Lampert's ambitions, Sears has continued to struggle, and the company has been forced to sell off assets in order to stay in business. The latest potential sale involves Kenmore, the retailer's appliance brand, which may be of interest to ESL Investments. However, it remains uncertain whether any sale of Kenmore would be enough to stop the bleeding and save the company. The struggles of Sears reflect the broader challenges facing the retail industry, which has been battered by the rise of e-commerce. The popularity of online shopping has caused a significant decrease in foot traffic at malls and brick-and-mortar stores, leaving many retailers scrambling to adjust their business models in order to remain viable. In addition, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has only amplified these challenges, as many shoppers have turned even more to online options to meet their needs. Despite its ongoing woes, Sears once represented a unique and important piece of American retail history. As the company continues to take painful steps to combat its losses, the question remains: Can Sears ultimately be saved, and what might that look like in a rapidly evolving retail landscape? In this period of uncertainty, one thing is clear: Sears' future depends on its ability to adapt and innovate in the face of these monumental challenges. With the upcoming closure of these 72 stores, the company is trimming the fat from its operations, but only time will tell if this is enough to turn around its fortunes or if the retail giant is ultimately destined for the history books."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Earnings Not Yet a Viral Sensation When Facebook Inc. boss Mark Zuckerberg announced first-quarter results, he didn't break the news with a Facebook post. He stuck with an old-fashioned news release. Across the U.S., earnings season came and went with few signs that companies are taking advantage of the Securities and Exchange Commission's green light to tweet or post market-moving information. On April 2, the SEC announced that companies \\"can use social media outlets like Facebook and Twitter to announce key information…so long as investors have been alerted about which social media will be used to disseminate such information.\\" Since then, only about a dozen firms have said they might break news on Facebook, Twitter and the like. And few of those companies make much noise online. Nielsen Holdings NV had fewer than 70 followers on its investor-relations department's Twitter account when the tracker of what consumers watch and buy said it might disclose financial information with tweets on that account. A Nielsen spokeswoman declined to comment. A Facebook spokesman said the company plans to \\"disseminate information as broadly as possible, and that will include using Facebook.\\" He wouldn't say when that would begin or if Facebook will ever use its own site as the primary place to report earnings. On Wednesday, Zillow Inc. took questions submitted via Facebook and Twitter during the real-estate website's earnings-related conference call. Zillow got questions from 11 accounts, mostly using tweets, according to a company spokeswoman. Some securities lawyers say the tepid response shows some corporate executives still are concerned they might get in trouble because of their tweets. One reason: The SEC's guidance was more general than specific, leaving the agency wiggle room to pursue enforcement action. As companies and their lawyers dug into an eight-page report laying out the agency's logic, some were bothered by the sentence, \\"Every case must be evaluated on its own facts.\\" The SEC also said that social-media channels need to clear the same hurdle of \\"broad and non-exclusionary distribution to the public\\" as other media in order to comply with the 13-year-old rule known as Regulation Fair Disclosure. Amy Goodman, a partner at law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, says the agency's guidance on the use of Facebook and Twitter suggests that companies \\"could still be vulnerable to enforcement action if that channel has very few followers and it's used as the sole means\\" to disclose financial information. The SEC has taken 13 enforcement actions against companies and executives for alleged earnings leaks and other rule breaches of Reg. FD, according to an analysis by Stanford University law professor Joseph Grundfest. One way to land in hot water is by tipping favored analysts to market-moving information. The same thing could happen now if a company's tweets are read by just a few investors. \\"I don't think the SEC is trying to trap people,\\" says Steve Quinlivan, a lawyer at Leonard, Street and Deinard PA in Minneapolis. \\"But if they think somebody crossed the line, they're not going to wait five minutes to bring an enforcement action.\\" The SEC declined to comment on the minimum number of Twitter followers needed for a company to safely tweet its earnings. \\"We do not comment on specific situations,\\" Lona Nallengara, acting director of the SEC's corporation-finance division, wrote in an email to The Wall Street Journal. In 2008, the SEC issued guidelines on how Reg. FD applies to corporate websites. Ms. Nallengara says companies \\"were able to figure out how to disclose information on their websites using our 2008 guidance,\\" and so \\"we believe they should be able to do the same with social media\\" using last month's announcement. For now, though, \\"companies are still taking a wait-and-see approach,\\" says Broc Romanek, editor of TheCorporateCounsel.net, a website for corporate lawyers. Last month's announcement by the SEC followed an investigation into a post by Netflix Inc. Chief Executive Reed Hastings on his personal Facebook page. In December, the SEC warned the streaming-video company that the agency intended to take enforcement action over the posting, where Mr. Hastings said monthly online viewing had surpassed a billion hours. Some senior SEC officials had misgivings about the potential Netflix lawsuit, and at least one of the agency's five commissioners questioned whether the agency should punish the company when there were no clear and up-to-date guidelines, no evidence the company acted in bad faith and no apparent harm to investors, people familiar with the probe say. The concerns were exacerbated when Mr. Grundfest, a former SEC commissioner, published a paper saying the agency faced a \\"significant risk\\" of losing to Netflix. Meanwhile, Netflix refused to enter settlement talks, arguing it had done nothing wrong, said the people familiar with the probe. George Canellos, the SEC's acting enforcement director at the time, recommended that the agency resolve the matter with a report that sets out the agency's thinking without taking enforcement action. In contrast to the SEC's typical practice, last month's announcement on the use of social media was made without any input from Netflix or a heads-up to the company, people close to the probe say.

You might watch and laugh when your dog chases its tail because it looks cute. But did you know that, even though it might appear like a fun game, it could mean your pet is sick? Researchers have found that if a dog runs after its tail, chases cars and barks  at flies that are not there, it may have obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD, ). In fact, OCD is even more common among humans. The symptoms   are varied: some people check and recheck the locks before they go out; others are extremely afraid of germs   and have to wash their hands many times a day. English soccer star David Beckham, for example, cannot stand odd numbers   of items in his fridge. So if he has three cans of drink he will throw one out, according to his wife Victoria. Hoping to better understand OCD in humans, a team of scientists from the University of Helsinki, Finland, studied 368 dogs, including those that chase their tail for several hours daily or a few times a month, according to Sciencedaily.com. They also examined dogs that had never chased their tails. Scientists took the dogs' blood sample   and asked their owners some questions about their pets' daily life. Findings showed that among all kinds of dogs, bull terriers   and German shepherds   were likely to chase their tails, which led scientists to believe that genes   can cause OCD. Diet also plays a part. It was found that dogs that eat food with certain vitamins and minerals chased their tails less. \\"Interestingly, there are indications   that vitamins and minerals are helpful in human OCD treatment,\\" said researcher Katriina Tiira. Moreover, tail-chasing is often found among dogs that were separated from their mothers too early or ones that didn't receive enough care. They are also more likely to turn out to be shyer and more afraid of loud noises at a young age. The study can help us understand the causes of OCD in humans. \\"Dogs share the same environment with humans, and large animals are physiologically   close to humans,\\" said Hannes Lohi, leader...

India's general election, the largest democratic exercise in history, begins Monday. Voters will elect 543 members to the lower house of parliament, which will then select the country's next prime minister. Here are 11 things you need to know about the world's biggest election: 1. Its massive scale. More than 814 million voters are eligible to cast ballots over the next month to elect the lower house of parliament, or Lok Sabha, up from 713 million voters in 2009. The Indian voting pool is larger than the total populations of the United States and Western Europe combined. Given the infrastructure in India, an election of this scale can't be done in a day. Voting will take place in nine blocks over the next five weeks, to allow election authorities to tackle the daunting logistics of operating 930,000 polling stations. The vote counting will be carried out and concluded on May 16. The figure is second only to the 7 billion spent in the 2012 OPTIONS: - BJP presidential race, the world's most expensive election. - India presidential race, the world's most expensive election. - Indian presidential race, the world's most expensive election. - Lok Sabha presidential race, the world's most expensive election. - Narendra Modi presidential race, the world's most expensive election. - United States presidential race, the world's most expensive election. - Western Europe presidential race, the world's most expensive election. - World presidential race, the world's most expensive election.","output":"2. Its cost. The 2019 Indian general election is the second most expensive election in the world, with around 7 billion being spent during the electoral process. The figure is second only to the 7 billion spent in the 2012 United States presidential race, the world's most expensive election. The high cost of the Indian elections can be attributed to the massive scale, extensive campaigning, advertising, and logistics that are necessary to facilitate the voting process across the country. 3. Key political parties. The two main political parties in India are the Indian National Congress (INC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The INC, which is led by Rahul Gandhi, has historically played a central role in Indian politics. The BJP, on the other hand, is led by incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and has gained popularity over the past decade, particularly among the middle class and urban populations. 4. Coalition politics. It is common for political parties in India to form coalitions in order to gain a majority in the Lok Sabha. Currently, the ruling alliance is the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by the BJP, while the main opposition alliance is the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) led by the INC. 5. Key issues. The primary issues in this election include job creation, economic growth, national security, and women's safety. Both the ruling BJP and the opposition INC have laid out their respective agendas and outlined their plans to address these critical areas. 6. Digital campaigning. Given the increasing importance of social media and digital platforms, both major parties have invested significantly in online advertising and communication strategies. This has led to a surge in the use of platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp for political messaging and engagement with the electorate. 7. Security concerns. Ensuring the safety of voters and election officials during the five-week voting period remains a significant challenge for Indian authorities. Thousands of security forces have been deployed across the country to maintain law and order and to prevent any disturbances. 8. Voting process. India uses electronic voting machines (EVMs) to record votes. This technology has been in use since 1999 and has been praised for its efficiency and accuracy. However, concerns about the possibility of tampering have arisen on occasion. In response, Indian authorities have introduced the Voter-Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT), which allows voters to verify their votes on a printed slip before it is stored in a sealed container. 9. International observers. As in previous years, the Indian general election has attracted the attention of election observers from various countries and international organizations. These observers monitor the electoral process to ensure that it is free, fair, and transparent. 10. Potential outcomes. Analysts predict that the BJP and its NDA coalition partners may win a majority of seats, enabling Narendra Modi to continue as Prime Minister. However, a strong performance by the INC and the UPA coalition cannot be ruled out, potentially leading to a negotiated outcome and the formation of a new government. 11. Impact on India's future. The outcome of the 2019 Indian general election will have significant implications for the country's domestic and foreign policies, as well as its economy. The new government's approach to issues such as job creation, economic growth, national security, and women's safety will be of critical importance in shaping India's future in the coming years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Supersonic explosions created by high explosives are known as detonations and travel via supersonic shock waves. Subsonic explosions are created by low explosives through a slower burning process known as deflagration. When caused by a man-made device such as an exploding rocket or firework, the audible component of an explosion is referred to as its \\"report\\" (which can also be used as a verb, e.g., \\"the rocket reported loudly upon impact\\".)  - Digital Domain is an American visual effects and digital production company based in Playa Vista, Los Angeles, California.

He is especially prolific in his novelizations of film scripts.  - A novelization (or novelisation) is a derivative novel that adapts the story of a work created for another medium, such as a film, TV series, comic strip or video game. Film novelizations were particularly popular before the advent of home video, but continue to find commercial success as part of marketing campaigns for major films. They are often written by accomplished writers based on an early draft of the film's script and on a tight deadline.  - Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \\"speculative literature\\".  - Innovation can be defined simply as a \\"new idea, device, or method\\". However, innovation is often also viewed as the application of better solutions that meet new requirements, unarticulated needs, or existing market needs. This is accomplished through more-effective products, processes, services, technologies, or business models that are readily available to markets, governments and society. The term \\"innovation\\" can be defined as something original and more effective and, as a consequence, new, that \\"breaks into\\" the market or society.

Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G.

The term was first used in print in 1957 by P. Schuyler Miller in a review of John W. Campbell, Jr.'s \\"Islands of Space\\" in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\". The complementary term soft science fiction, formed by analogy to hard science fiction, first appeared in the late 1970s. The term is formed by analogy to the popular distinction between the \\"hard\\" (natural) and \\"soft\\" (social) sciences. Science fiction critic Gary Westfahl argues that neither term is part of a rigorous taxonomy; instead they are approximate ways of characterizing stories that reviewers and commentators have found useful.  - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.  - Platinum Dunes is an American production company created in November 2001 by filmmakers Michael Bay, Brad Fuller, and Andrew Form. The company specializes in horror films.  - Genre (or ; from French \\"genre\\" , \\"kind\\" or \\"sort\\", from Latin \\"genus\\" (stem \\"gener-\\"), Greek , \\"gés\\")   - Extraterrestrial life, also called alien life (or, if it is a sentient or relatively complex individual, an \\"extraterrestrial\\" or \\"alien\\"), is life that does not originate from Earth. These as-yet-hypothetical life forms may range from simple single-celled organisms to beings with civilizations far more advanced than humanity. Although many scientists expect extraterrestrial life to exist, there is no unambiguous evidence for its existence so far. The science of extraterrestrial life is known as exobiology.  - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.

Step 1: Define the term Infatuation is a strong but short-lived passion or admiration for someone or something, often characterized by intense feelings or desires. Step 2: Identify possible associations Infatuation can be associated with excitement and positive emotions (like love, admiration, or desire), but it can also be associated with negative emotions (like obsession, unrequited feelings, or lack of rational judgment).

She calls for help. but recovers and makes it back to land.  As she senses the Wolf watching her, she is discovered by a woodsman, Peter, who scolds her for being foolish.

A detailed description of Las Meninas, which provides the identification of several of the figures, was published by Antonio Palomino (\\"the Giorgio Vasari of the Spanish Golden Age\\") in 1724. Examination under infrared light reveals minor pentimenti, that is, there are traces of earlier working that the artist himself later altered. For example, at first Velázquez's own head inclined to his right rather than his left.The painting has been cut down on both the left and right sides. It was damaged in the fire that destroyed the Alcázar in 1734, and was restored by court painter Juan García de Miranda (1677–1749). The left cheek of the Infanta was almost completely repainted to compensate for a substantial loss of pigment. After its rescue from the fire, the painting was inventoried as part of the royal collection in 1747–48, and the Infanta was misidentified as Maria Theresa, Margaret Theresa's older half-sister, an error that was repeated when the painting was inventoried at the new Madrid Royal Palace in 1772. A 1794 inventory reverted to a version of the earlier title, The Family of Philip IV, which was repeated in the  records of 1814. The painting entered the collection of the Museo del Prado on its foundation in 1819. In 1843, the Prado catalogue listed the work for the first time as Las Meninas.In recent years, the picture has suffered a loss of texture and hue. Due to exposure to pollution and crowds of visitors, the once-vivid contrasts between blue and white pigments in the costumes of the meninas have faded. It was last cleaned in 1984 under the supervision of the American conservator John Brealey, to remove a \\"yellow veil\\" of dust that had gathered since the previous restoration in the 19th century.

Article: Let Children Roam  Free Everyone agrees that playing outside keeps children thinner. The loss of opportunities for outdoor play is one of the main causes of childhood obesity. What is more remarkable is the growing evidence that children's mental health and emotional well-being are enhanced by contact with the outdoors, and that the restorative  effect appears to be strongest in natural settings. Researchers are convinced of the depth of the connection between children's well-being and the environment, claiming that contact with nature may be as important to children as good nutrition and adequate sleep. But now children seem to get less touch with outdoor activities. The root causes of the dramatic loss of children's freedom lie in changes to the very fabric of their lives over the last 30 years or so. The growth in road traffic, alongside poor town planning and shifts in the make-up and daily rhythms of families and communities, have left children with fewer outdoor places to go. These changes coincided with the \\"culture of fear\\": a generalized anxiety about all imaginary kinds of threats, even though children are statistically safer from harm now than at any point in human history. These physical, economic and social changes and fears have been made use of by manufactures and advertisers, whose products and messages both reinforce the logic of keeping children virtual prisoners, and force us to compensate them in the only way our cash-rich, time-poor society seems to know: by spending money on them. Government must bear some of the blame for keeping children prisoners indoor, through their promotion of planning policies that favour cars over communities and profit over people. The real planning crimes lie in housing companies occupying attractive parks and green spaces, and in town plans that force families to depend largely on their cars. There is no doubt that traffic danger, unlike stranger danger, is a real threat to children and a constant worry for parents.  Around 100 child pedestrians  are killed... Question: Playing outside is just as important as   _   . Answer: A:","output":"Playing outside is just as important as good nutrition and adequate sleep for children. The article highlights that contact with nature and outdoor activities not only keep children physically healthier by preventing obesity, but also significantly enhance their mental health and emotional well-being. Researchers argue that connecting with the environment plays a critical role in a child's overall development, similar to the significance of maintaining a balanced diet and getting enough rest. However, due to various factors such as changes in societal structure, town planning, and an increased culture of fear, children nowadays have fewer opportunities to engage in outdoor activities, negatively impacting their growth and well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the youngest Martha could have been when she died?  If the pigeon became alert, it would often stretch out its head and neck in line with its body and tail, then nod its head in a circular pattern. When aggravated by another pigeon, it raised its wings threateningly, but passenger pigeons almost never actually fought. The pigeon bathed in shallow water, and afterwards lay on each side in turn and raised the opposite wing to dry it.The passenger pigeon drank at least once a day, typically at dawn, by fully inserting its bill into lakes, small ponds, and streams. Pigeons were seen perching on top of each other to access water, and if necessary, the species could alight on open water to drink. One of the primary causes of natural mortality was the weather, and every spring many individuals froze to death after migrating north too early. In captivity, a passenger pigeon was capable of living at least 15 years; Martha, the last known living passenger pigeon, was at least 17 and possibly as old as 29 when she died. It is undocumented how long a wild pigeon lived.The bird is believed to have played a significant ecological role in the composition of pre-Columbian forests of eastern North America. For instance, while the passenger pigeon was extant, forests were dominated by white oaks. This species germinated in the fall, therefore making its seeds almost useless as a food source during the spring breeding season, while red oaks produced acorns during the spring, which were devoured by the pigeons. The absence of the passenger pigeon's seed consumption may have contributed to the modern dominance of red oaks. Due to the immense amount of dung present at roosting sites, few plants grew for years after the pigeons left. Also, the accumulation of flammable debris (such as limbs broken from trees and foliage killed by excrement) at these sites may have increased both the frequency and intensity of forest fires, which would have favored fire-tolerant species, such as bur oaks, black oaks, and white oaks over less fire-tolerant species, such as red oaks, thus helping to...

New FDA rules are helping ensure that we get the protection we pay for, and with skin cancer on the rise (one in five Americans will develop skin cancer in the course of a lifetime), these changes can't come soon enough. Key fixes: Sunscreens will be labeled \\"water resistant\\" (as opposed to waterproof or sweatproof); they can no longer be called \\"sunblocks\\" (as it overstates their effectiveness); and they can no longer claim to provide instant sun protection or to last more than two hours without reapplication. On top of that, sunscreens can be labeled \\"broad spectrum\\" only if they protect equally against UVB (the main culprit of skin cancer) and UVA rays, which cause aging. Unfortunately, the changes won't be on store shelves this summer. Last week the FDA announced it is giving manufacturers six additional months from their original deadline to meet the new requirements. And even with these changes, most of us still have questions. Here are the ones you sent to us, answered by our dermatologists. How much sunscreen do I really need to put on? Anytime you're planning to be outdoors, go with an SPF of at least 30 (45 for a little extra insurance) and put plenty on. The rule of thumb is 1 ounce (the size of a shot glass) on your body, and a teaspoon for your face, but derms advise being even more generous. Reapply every two hours -- more often if you're in and out of the water. Health.com: 7 ways you're aging your skin. Are there any sunscreens good for oily skin? Yes. What you want is an oil-free mineral block in an ultralight gel or liquid. \\"Mineral sunscreens help mask redness, and because they reflect UV light, they help keep your skin surface cooler,\\" Rodan notes. While you're at it, keep your skin clean by always washing your face after working up a sweat outdoors: Summer breakouts often have more to do with sweating than wearing sunscreen. How do I know if I'm spraying on enough sunscreen? I feel like it all blows away! Spray sunscreens aren't as powerful as lotions, so the trick is to look for one labeled \\"continuous spray\\" (no need to pump; it keeps spraying as long as your finger stays on the button) and apply two coats -- not one -- every hour, Rodan says. What should I look for in a sunscreen if I have sensitive skin? All the dermatologists we interviewed recommend mineral-based or physical sunscreens made with micronized titanium dioxide and/or zinc oxide instead of chemical sunscreens because they're less likely to irritate sensitive skin. Plus, the latest mineral sunscreens give the gentle protection of a physical sunscreen without leaving a white cast.Health.com: Short-and-sweet skin advice. Is sunscreen really necessary for lips? Absolutely. In the past, it wasn't unusual for lip products to come with little or no SPF. Thankfully, many companies have upped the level of protection in lip balms. That's critical because skin cancers on the lower lip, in particular, are especially aggressive. \\"These cancers are dangerous, as they're more likely to spread,\\" explains Jeremy Green, M.D., a Miami dermatologist. What's the easiest way to stay protected when I'm working out? Dab an SPF (of at least 30) stick or gel on your face, neck, and chest, and on hot spots like shoulders and the backs of your hands. \\"The non-tacky sticks are great because they really stay put,\\" says Washington, D.C.--based dermatologist Dr. Tina Alster. For the rest of your body, use a sunscreen spray. If you're swimming or perspiring a lot, opt for one of the new formulas that are marked \\"water resistant\\" for up to 40 or 80 minutes. Health.com: Fun-in-the-sun workout. I hate reapplying! Can I throw on a long-sleeved T-shirt instead at the beach? \\"Most cotton shirts are no substitute for sunscreen,\\" Rodan says. \\"At best, they give you a UPF (ultraviolet protection factor, the equivalent of SPF for clothing) of 8 -- and if they get wet, that devolves to UPF 2.\\" Instead, invest in a long-sleeved rash guard -- a type of shirt made up of a spandex and nylon mix that was originally used for water sports, but is now popular as a sun protector. Look for one with a UPF rating of 50+. \\"Those things are lifesavers -- total protection, even when wet,\\" Alster says. Likewise, your sun hat should be floppy, wide-brimmed, and made from a tightly woven material. Will my SPF foundation do the trick for workdays? \\"You'd have to slap on a heck of a lot to make it truly effective,\\" Green says. A better idea: Layer. Wash your face, swipe on a few drops of antioxidant serum to boost your protection, and apply a tinted moisturizer or foundation with SPF 15 or more. Top it with an ultra fine SPF mineral powder. Green recommends carrying the powder in your bag for touch-ups during the day -- especially if you're lunching alfresco. Copyright Health Magazine 2011.

In his youth he was apprenticed to the engraver Ellis Gamble in Leicester Fields, where he learned to engrave trade cards and similar products. Young Hogarth also took a lively interest in the street life of the metropolis and the London fairs, and amused himself by sketching the characters he saw. Around the same time, his father, who had opened an unsuccessful Latin-speaking coffee house at St John's Gate, was imprisoned for debt in Fleet Prison for five years. In 1731 Hogarth completed the earliest of his series of moral works, a body of work that led to significant recognition. The collection of six scenes was entitled A Harlot's Progress and appeared first as paintings (now lost) before being published as engravings. A Harlot's Progress depicts the fate of a country girl who begins prostituting - the six scenes are chronological, starting with a meeting with a bawd and ending with a funeral ceremony that follows the character's death from venereal disease.  The inaugural series was an immediate success and was followed in 1733-1735 by the sequel A Rake's Progress. The second instalment consisted of eight pictures that depicted the reckless life of Tom Rakewell, the son of a rich merchant, who spends all of his money on luxurious living, services from prostitutes, and gambling - the character's life ultimately ends in Bethlem Royal Hospital. The original paintings of A Harlot's Progress were destroyed in the fire at Fonthill House in 1755; the oil paintings of A Rake's Progress (1733-34) are displayed in the gallery room at Sir John Soane's Museum, London, UK.  When the success of A Harlot's Progress and A Rake's Progress resulted in numerous pirated reproductions by unscrupulous printsellers, Hogarth lobbied in parliament for greater legal control over the reproduction of his and other artists' work. The result was the Engravers' Copyright Act (known as 'Hogarth's Act'), which became law on 25 June 1735 and was the first copyright law to deal with visual works as well as the first to recognize the authorial rights of an individual artist.

While Reznor—the only official member until adding Atticus Ross in 2016—controls its creative and musical direction in the studio, the touring band performs different arrangements of the songs. In addition to regular concerts, the band has performed in both supporting and headlining roles at festivals such as Woodstock '94, Lollapalooza 1991 and 2008, and many other one-off performances including the MTV Video Music Awards. Prior to their 2013 tour, the band had played 938 gigs.Nine Inch Nails' live performances contrast with its in-studio counterpart. Reznor writes and performs nearly all Nine Inch Nails studio material, with occasional instrumental and vocal contributions from others artists.

Faith, 6, and Matthew and Michael, both 4, belong to Jamie and Dan Felice, a couple who struggled to have children before being matched with a donor through a group that collects unused frozen embryos. They received six embryos. Two pregnancies later, their family is complete.      \\"I was terrified at 20 to birth a child, but once I found the man of my dreams and wanted to have kids and wanted to create a child together like most couples, I wasn't afraid anymore,\\" said Jamie Felice, 47, who lives in Crystal Lake.      But after 10 attempts at artificial insemination and four unsuccessful rounds of in vitro fertilization, Jamie Felice was nearly 40, pumped full of hormones and ready to give up. Then she stumbled across an embryo donation organization.      \\"We thought, how cool is this?\\" she said. \\"I still get to carry the baby and experience pregnancy and how cool is it to connect on that?\\"      More than 600,000 frozen embryos are in storage in the United States, and embryo donation is a growing industry, with nearly 2,000 frozen embryos used in conception attempts in 2014, according to experts.      While many people are hesitant to get pregnant using donated embryos, the Felices are thrilled with their family.      Their home is filled with the thumping of little feet racing across the hardwood floors. On a recent weeknight, Matthew squealed as he caught the family cat, who defeatedly hung from his arms like a white, fluffy rag doll. In his haste, Matthew crashed into Faith, who ran to her mother with tears streaking down her pink cheeks and crawled into her lap for comfort.      Jamie and Dan Felice, a Crystal Lake couple who struggled to have children, adopted donated frozen embryos to get pregnant with their daughter Faith and twin boys Michael and Matthew.

You have them and they're yours. You don't even think twice. You would instantly die for them.\\"      Embryo donation is possible because of IVF, which began in 1978 and costs about 10,000 to 15,000 for a single IVF cycle in the U.S., depending on insurance coverage, patient characteristics and treatment centers, according to the website for the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, which represents the majority of IVF clinics in the U.S.      When a client undergoes IVF, clinics create dozens of embryos and pick the best ones to use. The leftover embryos are typically kept in frozen storage, donated to medical research or discarded, experts said. Nonprofit organizations like Nightlight Christian Adoptions, the one used by the Felices, and the National Embryo Donation Center help match donors to recipients around the nation. Some hospitals and fertility centers also have programs that match their patients with the donated embryos from people who have used their services for IVF.      Participating in an embryo donation program is less expensive than undergoing an IVF cycle and also less expensive than using a donor egg. The Felices paid about 2,000 for their four IVF cycles because their insurance covered the majority of the costs. This total does not include the copays for fertility drugs, blood draws, ultrasounds and other expenses. They paid 8,000, plus an additional 2,000 for a home study, to Snowflakes Embryo Adoption and Donation, a program through Nightlight.      However, many couples balk at the idea of having a child who is not biologically related to them, and even more people change their mind when it comes to donating embryos, said Dr. Brad Van Voorhis, president of the reproductive technology society.      \\"If you look at the literature on this, a lot of couples say at the outset that they're interested (in donating), but when push comes to shove, it's a much less frequent occurrence,\\" Van Voorhis said.      Nidhi Desai, partner at Ballard, Desai & Miller in Chicago, which specializes in adoption and reproductive technology law, agreed, saying that while the number of embryo donors is on the rise, it's still a small number.      It is becoming more and more common, but there's a very small minority of people who want to donate their embryos. — Nidhi Desai, Chicago attorney who specializes in adoption and reproductive technology law      \\"The national landscape is there are more organizations that are beginning to look at this as a viable means of building a family,\\" Desai said. \\"Depends on the angle from which you approach it. It is becoming more and more common, but there's a very small minority of people who want to donate their embryos.\\"      About 65,175 babies were born via IVF from clinics associated with the reproductive technology society in 2014, an increase from the 63,286 babies born via IVF from its clinics in 2013, according to a national report by the society. IVF accounts for less than 5 percent of all infertility treatment in the United States.      Embryo donation is also getting a boost from religiously affiliated organizations like Nightlight, which see the unused embryos as an opportunity to promote anti-abortion issues. This also extends to the kind of terminology various groups use.      \\"It's truly a gift to the adopting family,\\" said Kimberly Tyson, marketing and program director for Snowflakes. \\"The contract has adoption language, so the donor is relinquishing parental rights and responsibilities in that contract.\\"      Anti-abortion groups believe that life begins at the point the egg and the sperm fuse, therefore they use terms like \\"adopter\\" rather than \\"recipient.\\"      Van Voorhis, medical professionals and pro-abortion rights groups see embryos as a \\"scarce medical resource\\" rather than a child.      In the eyes of the law, embryos are considered property, not people. Before an exchange occurs, both the donor and the recipient have to sign a contract exchanging property, Desai said. The Felices received a standard contract from Snowflakes and then made amendments with a lawyer. Neither the recipient nor the donor receive payment in the exchange.      Donors are required to meet certain requirements set by the Food and Drug Administration, which could include testing for diseases like AIDS and hepatitis, and reviews of medical and genetic history. Although not required by the FDA, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine recommends recipients be tested for blood type and receive psychological counseling. At Snowflakes, recipients also have to complete a home study.      The process can seem overwhelming, and there can be a significant financial commitment. But for couples like the Felices, the hardships are worth the outcome. ||||| \\"I made it less than a month,\\" Fleiderman says. Her doctor at the time had predicted that might happen.      \\"He said right then and there, 'Your pregnancy's not going to last,' because of my age,\\" Fleiderman recalls.      The following year, in 2008, Fleiderman and Borges turned to artificial insemination. Again Fleiderman got pregnant, but at around week five her OB-GYN told her she feared Fleiderman had an ectopic pregnancy. A few days later, Fleiderman was given medication to stop the growth of the abnormally progressing pregnancy, and she miscarried again.      \\"The emotional and financial strain of trying to get pregnant and having failed pregnancies, one after another, it's horrible,\\" Fleiderman says.      But she and Borges kept trying.      Fleiderman's OB-GYN referred the couple to Dr. Sam Najmabadi, a reproductive endocrinology infertility specialist at the Center for Reproductive Health & Gynecology in Beverly Hills. Dr. Najmabadi oversaw two more rounds of artificial insemination, in November and December 2010, neither of which resulted in pregnancy.      Fleiderman attempted one more round of artificial insemination with Dr. Najmabadi in March 2011. That didn't work, either.      \\"He told me that was an indication that even if I went for full-on in-vitro [fertilization], my eggs were just not responding that well,\\" she says.      Then, in late spring of 2011, Dr. Najmabadi brought up another way Fleiderman and Borges might conceive — with the help of an Arizona couple they'd never met.      Fleiderman wasn't always sure she wanted to have a child, but she did have some parenting experience. From the time she was 36, she played second-in-command to the parents of her godson, Benjamin, who is now 16.      Benjamin's father has been a close friend of Fleiderman's since her late 20s. She helped raise Benjamin since birth. \\"He's an only child and I was one of the first to hold him when he was born, and I just fell in love with him,\\" Fleiderman says. \\"I promised him I would stay by his side.\\"      Fleiderman moved back to Los Angeles eight years ago from San Jose so she could keep that promise. She rented a room from Benjamin's father so she could live with her godson.      \\"I was the one who taught him how to swim,\\" Fleiderman says. \\"I cared for him all the time when I lived with him, and after that he stayed with me on weekends. I was his third parent.\\"      Sitting in Dr. Najmabadi's office that day in spring 2011, Fleiderman's complicated journey to motherhood finally came into focus. She recalls thinking: \\"I already had experience loving a child that wasn't genetically related to me.\\"      She says that as she sat there crying, \\"I felt a divine assistance of some sort. I'm not a heavily religious person, but all of a sudden I felt compelled to ask, 'Is there anything else? Like embryo ... or something?'\\" Fleiderman recalls saying to Dr. Najmabadi, not really sure how to finish her own sentence.      \\"And then he looked up at me, and he said, 'You know, as a matter of fact there is. Every now and again people leave embryos behind with me.'\\"      In July 1978, the very first \\"test-tube baby,\\" Louise Joy Brown, was born in England. She arrived 34 years after the first human embryo was created in vitro — and after hundreds of failed attempts to birth an IVF baby.      Infertility treatment and options would rapidly expand in the four decades following Brown's landmark birth. More than 5 million babies have now entered the world as a result of IVF.      Embryo adoption is sort of a by-product of IVF. In IVF, eggs and sperm are collected (either the couple's own, or eggs and/or sperm provided by donors), and the healthiest eggs are fertilized by the sperm outside of the body, with the hope of creating multiple embryos. One round of IVF can cost up to 15,000 without egg or sperm donors — and up to 30,000 if an egg donor is needed.      The embryos are given three to five days to mature, then one or more are transferred into a women's uterus, hopefully to implant and grow into a pregnancy. Others are frozen for later use.      A 2011 summary of 295 assisted reproductive technology clinics and four cryo­storage facilities found that they were holding more than 387,000 frozen embryos — and estimated that another 225,000 frozen embryos were stored elsewhere in the United States.      Along the way, a woman occasionally will end up with extra frozen embryos that she and her partner don't intend to use, for whatever reason. Often they don't know what to do with these extra embryos. Sometimes they store them, sometimes they unfreeze them and let nature take its course, and sometimes they give them to a doctor or a facility or a specific parent-to-be.      \\"I almost never saw anybody donating embryos for adoption 20 years ago,\\" Dr. Najmabadi says. \\"I don't know if it's the times or our education of the patient, but now more and more of that is happening.\\"      In 1997, Nightlight Christian Adoptions created the first embryo adoption agency, the Snowflakes Embryo Adoption and Donation program, in response to the growing number of unused IVF embryos in frozen storage facilities. Children born from the embryos donated through the agency are often called \\"snowflake babies.\\" Kimberly Tyson, Snowflakes' marketing and program director, says the name of the program was intentional — that \\"like natural snowflakes, human embryos are frozen, unique and a gift from heaven.\\"      The term \\"snowflake babies\\" caught on, and many families now use the term for any baby born as a result of an embryo donation.      Tyson says that well over 1,000 babies have been born into families through embryo adoption agencies, which operate similarly to some traditional adoption agencies in that the donating family chooses recipients from prospective parent profiles.      \\"The essence of our embryo adoption model is to encourage open relationships between the donor and the adopter,\\" Tyson says. At Snowflakes, she adds, finding a donating family that's willing to adopt to a woman older than 45 is rare. She says donors \\"are trying to select the family that they believe will provide any resulting children with a safe and loving home environment, with parents who are healthy and able to care for them.\\"      \\"There really isn't a difference in a woman's ability to actually carry a pregnancy with an adopted embryo, whether she's 48 or 46 or 45.\\"      —Dr. Kristin A. Bendikson, with the USC Keck School of Medicine Facebook      Twitter      More shares recommend reddit email            Embryo donation also occurs at the fertility clinics where the embryos were created. At the clinics, the biological parents generally don't participate in selecting prospective parents for their donated embryos and are more likely to remain anonymous. Dr. Najmabadi says that at his clinic, some donors do place restrictions on potential recipients but for the most part don't remain involved after they choose to donate their embryos.      Dr. Kristin A. Bendikson, with the division of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at the USC Keck School of Medicine, says her clinic transfers adopted embryos into women up to the age of 53. \\"There really isn't a difference in a woman's ability to actually carry a pregnancy with an adopted embryo, whether she's 48 or 46 or 45.\\"      According to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, women should not undergo embryo transfers after the age of 55.      Dr. Bendikson acknowledges that an older couple considering embryo adoption should take into account the potential drawbacks of having children at an advanced age.      \\"I think that it's important to consider the long-term ability to fulfill the emotional, psychological and physical needs of the child, and also consider what the chances of long-term parental relationships are going to be,\\" she says. \\"I also think that it is helpful for anyone undergoing embryo adoption to undergo psychological counseling. That is beneficial not only because of the age of the patient but also because of the adoption process in general and having a child that is not genetically yours.\\"0x000A      Couples who donate embryos also have pros and cons to take into account.      Kimmi Carlos, a middle-school language arts teacher, and her husband, Ryan, a Los Angeles firefighter, had to weigh the emotional impact of donating embryos to a woman who would give birth to and raise a child that is genetically theirs.      \\"When you're going through IVF, one thing that you're not really prepared for is the amount of extra embryos that you might have,\\" says Kimmi Carlos, who, like her husband, is 34. \\"The majority of people don't have a ton. They have what they need. It's more common to have too few than it is to have an abundance. \\"      But Kimmi and Ryan Carlos did have an abundance of embryos. They were left with 12 strong embryos after successfully getting pregnant with their now 5-year-old twins, a boy and a girl.      Kimmi Carlos had a tough time with her initial pregnancy with the twins. She spent nearly 12 weeks on bed rest, and she knew she didn't want go through that again.      Then, 14 months after the twins were born, Kimmi Carlos got pregnant naturally with their third child, a son who's now 3.      The Carlos family eventually decided to donate their remaining 12 embryos.      \\"I personally struggled, as I'd be pushing my twins on swings at the park, with why they got to be the lucky two, as much as I love them,\\" Kimmi Carlos says. \\"I felt in my heart the rest of them deserved the same chance at life.\\"      The matured embryos that would become the Fleiderman-Borges twins came from a group of six that were created and frozen seven years before Fleiderman asked the right question at the right time in Dr. Naj­mabadi's office.      Back in 2007, an Arizona couple had been having trouble getting pregnant, so they paid a donor to provide them with an egg to be fertilized by the husband's sperm. The couple traveled to L.A. and went through the IVF process with Dr. Najmabadi, and they successfully had a baby.      Five years later, the couple decided that their family was complete and gave Dr. Najmabadi their blessing to donate their remaining half-dozen embryos to other hopeful parents-to-be.      Fleiderman remembers Dr. Najmabadi pulling a sheet of paper out from under his desk calendar. The list contained the names of previous patients who had donated their extra frozen embryos.      \\"The doctor told us it was impossible for us to have kids with her eggs, even though she was very healthy and could carry the pregnancy, so there wasn't much else we could do.\\"      —Mauricio Borges Facebook      Twitter      More shares recommend reddit email            And it was a short list. Of the roughly 40 percent of Dr. Najmabadi's patients who end up with extra embryos, he estimates that only 5 percent choose to donate their embryos to others.      Dr. Najmabadi told Fleiderman that he could give her some embryos; she would have to pay only for the implantation. The cost would come to about 3,000. Fleiderman says that once she took her ego out of it, she loved the idea.      \\"I thought, 'If I'm a true mother, I want [my] children to have the strongest bodies possible,\\" Fleiderman says. \\"So I should not try and insist they be from my eggs.\\" The egg donor the Arizona couple used was 22 years old at the time the embryos were created.      Borges says he was willing to try everything to have children together, no matter what. \\"The doctor told us it was impossible for us to have kids with her eggs, even though she was very healthy and could carry the pregnancy, so there wasn't much else we could do,\\" Borges says. \\"She asked me what I thought, and I said, 'If it's good for you, it's good for me.'\\"      There also was the cost factor. Securing an egg donor and going through the IVF process would come to about 30,000 — 10 times as much as embryo adoption. \\"It was beyond a generous offer,\\" Fleiderman says.      Once Fleiderman decided to go forward with the gift, she let Dr. Najmabadi choose the donor from the list. \\"I didn't want to pick, because it didn't sit right,\\" she says. \\"It felt like shopping. Letting the doctor choose made it feel more natural.\\"      Dr. Najmabadi says that when it's left up to him, he tries to select embryos that come from biological parents who have similar physical characteristics to those of the parents-to-be.      \\"We try to match the prospective parent with a close match in race, eye color and hair color of the donor,\\" Najmabadi says. \\"For example, if someone comes in with blond hair and green eyes, we would go through our data bank and say, OK, we have maybe one donor that matches them or three donors that match them, and then we present those options to the patient.\\"      He says he can describe the donors' characteristics to the would-be parents but can't show any pictures due to doctor-patient confidentiality.      Kai and Audrey's genetic parents were the closest physical match to Fleiderman and her husband, and made the most sense to Dr. Najmabadi in terms of the other factors, so their embryos were the ones chosen to come to life.      The embryo transplant wasn't an immediate success. In June 2011, Dr. Najmabadi initially tried to transfer only one embryo, because Fleiderman didn't want to chance a multiple birth.      The process itself takes less than 10 minutes. To prepare, the patient goes through a series of estrogen and progesterone supplements, to mimic what would be happening to the body if it were experiencing a natural pregnancy. The embryos are thawed on either day three or day five of the progesterone supplement, corresponding to whether the embryos were frozen on day three or day five after fertilization.      On the day of transfer, the patient takes a Valium and goes into a dark room near the back of the clinic to relax. Some patients opt to receive acupuncture. Then Dr. Naj­mabadi goes to work.      \\"I go in under ultrasound guidance, put a catheter into the uterus and release the embryos into the uterus,\\" Dr. Najmabadi says. \\"That's it. That's the embryo transfer process.\\"      The next step is implantation, in which the embryo basically digs itself into the uterine lining. It doesn't always work.      \\"Once it's figured out, someone will win the Nobel Prize, because there's a lot that we don't know about it,\\" Dr. Najmabadi says of the factors that guide implantation.      The embryo successfully implanted into Fleiderman's uterine lining — but the pregnancy resulted in another miscarriage, on Fleiderman's 48th birthday. \\"That one was probably the hardest,\\" she says.      Dr. Najmabadi says he suspected the problem might have been with the embryo itself. \\"Many times abnormal embryos do not continue past a certain stage of pregnancy after they have implanted,\\" he says. \\"It is sometimes possible to get pregnant with an abnormal embryo that then results in a miscarriage.\\"      Genetic screening and diagnosis of the embryo can be done, reducing the odds of an abnormal embryo being transferred. However, Dr. Najmabadi says this kind of testing is invasive and expensive, so most embryo transfers are done without it.      Fleiderman tried again four months later, this time with two embryos. But neither would implant into her uterine wall. Fleiderman feared the stress of the loss of her mother, who had died from lymphoma, was not helping the situation. So she decided to take a break.      \\"Then my husband got himself detained,\\" Fleiderman says.      \\"I made the mistake of getting arrested while driving without a license, and that put me in a very bad situation,\\" Borges says. \\"They were going to deport me back to Brazil.\\"      Borges was first sent to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Contra Costa West County Detention Facility in Richmond before being relocated to the Adelanto Detention Facility in Adelanto.      Merely being married to a U.S. citizen is no longer a path to getting a green card if a person didn't enter the country legally in the first place. Because Borges entered the United States illegally in 2002, his marriage to Fleiderman, a U.S. citizen, is irrelevant to his immigration status.      With her husband stuck in Adelanto, Fleiderman decided to push ahead and try to get pregnant again.      This time, Dr. Najmabadi suggested trying to implant all three of the remaining embryos. But Fleiderman told him she wasn't sure she could handle it if all three happened to take, so she wanted to try with two instead.      Fleiderman says that on that day in February 2013, she showed up for the procedure at her most relaxed yet. \\"I went in by myself, popped the Valium and fell asleep after the transfer,\\" she says. \\"It felt a lot like a Pap smear and only took about an eighth of a second. And bam! I was pregnant.\\"      It took weeks before Fleiderman's blood test showed that both embryos had successfully implanted. Fleiderman admits that when Dr. Najmabadi confirmed she was pregnant with twins, she was torn.      \\"At that point I was so tired they could have told me I was going to give birth to Martians and I would have been like, 'OK, that's fine. What time do I need to report for the birth?'\\"      But at other times, she says, \\"I definitely freaked out that there were two.\\"      She was still unsure of her husband's residency status. Borges' immigration lawyers were telling Fleiderman there was a 50-50 chance that he'd be deported to Brazil. \\"I was anticipating that I would basically be a single mother,\\" she says. \\"A single mother of one was daunting enough.\\"      Fleiderman says she started thinking about articles she'd read that described complications with multiple births, as well as situations when embryos were removed to save other embryos, or because the number of births posed a risk to the mother's health, or even because the parent wasn't able to properly care for more than one infant.      So she asked about embryo reduction.      Embryo reduction is performed by only a few doctors in the Los Angeles area, and Dr. Najmabadi isn't one of them. It's a process where the doctor removes one or more embryos after an IVF cycle to give the other embryos a better chance of survival.      Then Fleiderman's doctor showed her an ultrasound image of the two embryos and let her listen to their heartbeats. Fleiderman says she thought to herself, \\"Well, I'm kind of old to be having these babies, so I'll keep them both — so when I'm senile, they'll have each other.\\"      But she still wasn't sure she could handle raising the two of them if her husband were to fail to get U.S. citizenship. She asked her cousin if he would be willing to raise one of them as a co-parent. She also scheduled an appointment to meet with an adoption counselor.      After missing her appointment three times, Fleiderman says she was hit with another realization. \\"One day I just looked down at my belly and I said, 'OK, I get the message. You guys don't want to be separated.'\\"      About halfway through Fleiderman's pregnancy, Borges was released from detention pending a deportation hearing. His immigration lawyers seemed to think the result would be one of two extremes: He would be granted a green card or sent back to Brazil.      \\"I really worried about her, because she was so big and pregnant,\\" Borges says. \\"It wasn't easy for her, being 50 and pregnant with twins. And she helped me with lawyers, all the papers, everything to get me out of there.\\"      Borges says when they let him leave Ade­lanto in May 2013, pending his hearing, that it was like \\"a gift from God.\\"      And it left Fleiderman free to focus on enjoying her pregnancy as much as possible.      \\"Pregnancy was not comfortable with twins, at 50, at all,\\" Fleiderman says. \\"My feet expanded a size and a half!\\"      When the day finally came for the twins to be born — Sept. 24, 2013 — she was ready. \\"I actually drove myself to the maternity ward.\\"      The twins were delivered via Cesarean section. Fleiderman made it through the delivery fine, but she lost a lot of blood due to a blood-clotting condition.      \\"I remember hearing Kai. I heard him cry, and then I kind of deliriously remember Audrey,\\" she says. \\"And then I passed out.\\"      \\"I saw my boy first, and after that Audrey,\\" Borges recalls. \\"Audrey was more skinny, smaller; Kai was bigger, more fat.\\"      Audrey had to be kept in an incubator for a week because she did not have enough body fat to hold her temperature. \\"I was a little concerned,\\" Fleiderman says. \\"But I was happy they made it, that they were safe. It was a healthy pregnancy, by general standards.\\"      Ariane Fleiderman with her son, Kai, and daughter, Audrey Photo by Danny Liao      On Sept. 22, 2014, two days before the twins' first birthday, Borges had his deportation hearing. He was granted a temporary work visa and was permitted to stay in the United States legally.      \\"It was my second chance,\\" Borges says.      His second chance has allowed him to see Audrey and Kai start developing their own personalities. \\"Audrey is so smart, it's scary,\\" Fleiderman says. \\"She wants to do everything herself. She's my little chili pepper — she's a little spicy.      \\"Kai is my little piece of chocolate,\\" she says. \\"He's just sweet.\\"      Fleiderman and Borges say that Audrey looks out for Kai, even though she's younger by one minute.      \\"They are like a team. Anytime you give anything to Audrey, like a piece of food, the first word out of her mouth is 'Kai,' to make sure you give something to Kai, too,\\" Borges says. \\"She is very protective of him.      \\"They've hijacked my life,\\" Fleiderman says. \\"Which is fine. One nice thing about having them when I was older is that I've been able to travel and work [before I had them], and so I'm at peace with dedicating all my time to raising them.\\"      From the group of embryos created by the Arizona couple, the twins have at least one sibling that Fleiderman knows about. \\"Kai and Audrey were frozen in time,\\" Fleiderman says. \\"They were conceived at the same time, but if they were ever to meet their sibling, their sibling would be eight years older.\\"      Fleiderman and Borges say they're open to the twins meeting their biological family someday, if the Arizona couple is amenable. Dr. Najmabadi says he would be willing to discuss the issue with his patients.      Fleiderman says she does not feel threatened by the possibility of bringing biological family members into her family dynamic — and she hopes other women having difficulty conceiving might come to the same realization. \\"I would tell women not to sweat making it their egg, and men not to sweat making it their sperm,\\" she says.      Fleiderman says that even though it's not her and her husband's DNA they're passing on, they have been able to connect with their children in a profound way by experiencing pregnancy and childbirth.      \\"I always tease people and say, 'I beat the fertility clock,'\\" she says. \\"How about that?\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Jamie and Dan Felice, a couple who struggled with infertility, found hope through embryo donation, a growing industry in the United States.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the building which exact location early on is unknown?  A third ward was created during Edward I's extension to the Tower, as the narrow enclosure completely surrounded the castle. At the same time a bastion known as Legge's Mount was built at the castle's north-west corner. Brass Mount, the bastion in the north-east corner, was a later addition. The three rectangular towers along the east wall 15 metres (49 ft) apart were dismantled in 1843. Although the bastions have often been ascribed to the Tudor period, there is no evidence to support this; archaeological investigations suggest that Legge's Mount dates from the reign of Edward I. Blocked battlements (also known as crenellations) in the south side of Legge's Mount are the only surviving medieval battlements at the Tower of London (the rest are Victorian replacements). A new 50-metre (160 ft) moat was dug beyond the castle's new limits; it was originally 4.5 metres (15 ft) deeper in the middle than it is today. With the addition of a new curtain wall, the old main entrance to the Tower of London was obscured and made redundant; a new entrance was created in the south-west corner of the external wall circuit. The complex consisted of an inner and an outer gatehouse and a barbican, which became known as the Lion Tower as it was associated with the animals as part of the Royal Menagerie since at least the 1330s. The Lion Tower itself no longer survives. Edward extended the south side of the Tower of London onto land that had previously been submerged by the River Thames. In this wall, he built St Thomas's Tower between 1275 and 1279; later known as Traitors' Gate, it replaced the Bloody Tower as the castle's water-gate. The building is unique in England, and the closest parallel is the now demolished water-gate at the Louvre in Paris. The dock was covered with arrowslits in case of an attack on the castle from the River; there was also a portcullis at the entrance to control who entered. There were luxurious lodgings on the first floor. Edward also moved the Royal Mint into the Tower; its exact location early on...

During a divination session, the shell or bone was anointed with blood, and in an inscription section called the \`\`preface'', the date was recorded using the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches, and the diviner name was noted. Next, the topic of divination (called the \`\`charge'') was posed, such as whether a particular ancestor was causing a king's toothache. The divination charges were often directed at ancestors, whom the ancient Chinese revered and worshiped, as well as natural powers and Dì (帝), the highest god in the Shang society. A wide variety of topics were asked, essentially anything of concern to the royal house of Shang, from illness, birth and death, to weather, warfare, agriculture, tribute and so on. One of the most common topics was whether performing rituals in a certain manner would be satisfactory.","output":"Yes, it's true that oracle bones were used by the Chinese to divine the past, as well as to seek guidance and answers to questions about various aspects of life, as seen from the provided text. Oracle bones were employed mainly during the Shang Dynasty (approximately 1600 BCE – 1046 BCE) in China and were a significant aspect of their culture and beliefs.  Oracle bones are typically split into turtle shells or animal bones, with the most common being ox scapulae and turtle plastrons. These bones served as crucial tools for diviners who aimed to decipher messages and prophecies about past events and the possible consequences of their actions. The process of divination involved inscribing questions, also known as \\"charges,\\" and their responses on the oracle bones. The text explains the process of an oracle bone divination session. The divination started with an anointment of blood, which was followed by the inscription of the date using the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches. This ancient Chinese calendar system combined ten celestial stems and twelve terrestrial branches to establish a cycle of 60 years, and oracle bones provided important evidence for understanding and reconstructing these chronological frameworks. The diviner's name would also be noted on the bones, followed by the charge, which covered a wide range of subjects relevant to the Shang royal house. These subjects included illness, birth, death, weather, warfare, agriculture, tributes, and rituals, among others. Ancestors, deities, and natural powers were frequently addressed in the charges, as the ancient Chinese believed they were influential forces in their lives. Since many questions were directed at ancestors whom the ancient Chinese revered and worshiped, oracle bones are considered an essential source for understanding the belief system, ancestral cults, and the hierarchy of deities in ancient Chinese society. Overtime, oracle bone divination fell out of practice, and the script used on these bones developed into modern-day Chinese characters. It wasn't until the end of the 19th century that oracle bones were rediscovered, and since then, they have proven to be an invaluable resource for historians, allowing them to gain extensive insights into the political, economic, cultural, and religious aspects of ancient China, particularly during the Shang Dynasty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

First, lay out all the eggs you’re boiling in a pot. Then pour in cold water until the eggs are just covered. Since quail eggs are so small, using a pan instead of a pot will make the water boil faster. Just make sure the water covers the eggs entirely. Dip a slotted spoon into the water and fish out each egg. Place it in a bowl of water filled with ice to cool it off enough to handle. Leave the eggs in the bath for 1 minute and then check if they’re cool enough. Wait longer if they’re still hot.  Don’t reach into the boiling water or you will burn yourself. The ice bath also makes the shells come off easier when you peel the eggs. Once you’ve peeled the eggs, there are many ways to serve them. Pop them in your mouth whole for a quick snack. For a classic breakfast, put the eggs on a piece of toast with salt and pepper. Sliced up quail eggs also work as a great salad topping.  Use a very thin knife to slice the eggs. If you don’t have a thin knife, try using a strip of dental floss to slice them. If you like spice, add some powdered cayenne pepper. Boiled eggs can last up to a week in the refrigerator. You can also pickle the eggs by soaking them in vinegar.

Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","output":"Based on the provided sentence from the movie review, it appears that the movie was seen positively by the reviewer. The sentence consists of a combination of words that can be deciphered to better understand this positive evaluation. First, let's dissect the phrase \\"awfully good\\". Although \\"awfully\\" might be considered negative when used independently, when used in this context as an adverb, it serves to intensify the adjective \\"good.\\" This expression ultimately means that the movie was extremely good or exceptionally good, which supports the idea that the reviewer has a positive opinion about the movie. Now, let's examine the \\"achingly human picture\\" part of this sentence. An \\"achingly human picture\\" indicates that the movie contained elements that were very relatable, emotionally touching, and perhaps raw in representing the human experience. By using the word \\"achingly\\", the reviewer highlights the intensity of the movie's realism and the emotions it evokes, which are more likely to be interpreted as positive qualities. The word \\"human\\" also implies the movie captured the essence of human emotions, experiences, and behaviors, making it captivating and engaging to the audience. Given these observations, we can conclude that the movie was seen positively by the reviewer. The phrase \\"an awfully good, achingly human picture\\" suggests that the movie was highly praised due to its exceptional qualities, emotional depth, and the relatable human experiences it effectively portrays."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Lewis \\"Scooter\\" Libby (first name generally given as Irv, Irve or Irving; born August 22, 1950) is an American lawyer and former advisor to Vice President Dick Cheney. From 2001 to 2005, Libby held the offices of Assistant to the Vice President for National Security Affairs and Chief of Staff to the Vice President of the United States and Assistant to the President during the administration of President George W. Bush. In October 2005, Libby resigned from all three government positions after he was indicted on five counts by a federal grand jury concerning the investigation of the leak of the covert identity of Central Intelligence Agency officer Valerie Plame Wilson. He was subsequently convicted of four counts (one count of obstruction of justice, two counts of perjury, and one count of making false statements), making him the highest-ranking White House official convicted in a government scandal since John Poindexter, the national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan in the Iran-Contra affair. On March 6, 2007, the jury convicted him on four of the five counts but acquitted him on count three, the second charge of making false statements when interviewed by federal agents about his conversations with Time reporter Matthew Cooper.  After being questioned by the FBI in the fall of 2003 and testifying before a Federal grand jury on March 5, 2004, and again on March 24, 2004, Libby pleaded not guilty to all five counts. According to the Associated Press, David Addington, Cheney's legal counsel, described a September 2003 meeting with Libby around the time that a criminal investigation began, saying that Libby had told him, \\"'I just want to tell you, I didn't do it'... I didn't ask what the 'it' was.'\\"  Libby retained attorney Ted Wells of the firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison to represent him. Wells had successfully defended former Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy against a 30-count indictment and had also participated in the successful defense of former Secretary of Labor Raymond Donovan.  After Judge Reggie Walton denied Libby's motion to dismiss, the press initially reported that Libby would testify at the trial. Libby's criminal trial, United States v. Libby, began on January 16, 2007. A parade of Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists testified, including Bob Woodward, Walter Pincus and Glenn Kessler of The Washington Post and Judith Miller and David E. Sanger of The New York Times.

Question: What do you call plastids that contain the green pigment chlorophyll? Answer: chloroplasts","output":"Supporting Fact 1: Chloroplasts are the organelles responsible for photosynthesis, which is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose or other sugars. Supporting Fact 2: The green pigment chlorophyll in chloroplasts allows these organisms to absorb sunlight, particularly in the blue and red parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. This absorption of light energy enables the excitation of electrons which then initiates the process of photosynthesis. Supporting Fact 3: Chloroplasts are unique to plants and photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms, and they have a double membrane structure. They contain their own DNA, which indicates they likely evolved from ancient photosynthetic bacteria through a process called endosymbiosis. Supporting Fact 4: There are two main types of chlorophyll found in chloroplasts: chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b. Both types have a similar structure but slightly different absorption properties, which allows plants to maximize energy capture from sunlight. Supporting Fact 5: The structure of a chloroplast comprises an outer membrane, an inner membrane, internal stacks of flattened sac-like structures called thylakoids, which house the chlorophyll molecules, and a surrounding fluid called stroma. The light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis occur in the thylakoid membranes, while the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle) occur in the stroma."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Close up: This phrase indicates that the focus is on a particular aspect or detail of the mountain stream. It suggests that instead of viewing the stream from a distance, we are brought nearer to it, allowing us to observe its characteristics more closely. 2. Fast flowing: This term describes the movement of the water in the stream. The stream is not stagnant or calm; instead, it rushes with energy and speed, creating an atmosphere of dynamism and vibrancy. This detail also impacts other aspects of the scene, such as the sound and sights of the flowing water, potentially evoking feelings of excitement or awe in the observer. 3. Mountain stream: These words set the location and context of the scene. A mountain stream is a natural watercourse that typically arises in an upland or hilly region and flows downhill. It has characteristics distinct from other bodies of water, such as lakes or rivers, which can be broader and calmer. Mountain streams can be associated with purity, freshness, and the untamed beauty of nature. 4. Winter: The season in which this scene takes place greatly affects the overall mood and imagery. Winter brings with it cold temperatures, snow, and ice, dramatically changing the landscape and the appearance of the stream. The combination of a fast flowing mountain stream in the winter suggests challenges related to the harsh environment, such as frozen water and slippery surfaces, but can also evoke a sense of tranquility and desolation. Each of these words holds a specific significance within the sentence and, when taken together, they paint a vivid and engaging picture of a close up of a fast flowing mountain stream in winter."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Bhairavi Answer:","output":"Step 1: Establish the main characters and their backgrounds In order to build a movie plot around the given information, the first step is to establish the main characters and their backgrounds. In this case, the main characters are JKB, Sindhu, and Bhairavi. - JKB: A successful businessman who is married to Bhairavi but is secretly having an affair with Sindhu. - Sindhu: A young and attractive woman who lives alone in her apartment. She is involved in a secret affair with JKB. - Bhairavi: JKB's wife, who is unaware of her husband's infidelity until she catches him coming out of Sindhu's apartment. Step 2: Develop the plot and conflicts Now, we'll build up the story by developing the plot and creating conflicts between the characters. 1. The movie starts by introducing the seemingly perfect life of JKB and Bhairavi, portraying them as a happy and successful couple.  2. As the story unfolds, JKB's secret affair with Sindhu is revealed. They are shown to share a passionate and intense relationship, with JKB frequently visiting Sindhu's apartment. 3. Meanwhile, Bhairavi starts getting suspicious about her husband's behavior and their deteriorating relationship. She decides to investigate the matter and follow JKB one day. 4. On the day of the climax, Bhairavi follows her husband, expecting to uncover a secret. She then catches JKB leaving Sindhu's apartment. This moment serves as the turning point in the story, shattering Bhairavi's trust in JKB. 5. Enraged and heartbroken, Bhairavi confronts JKB about his infidelity, leading to a major conflict between them. This confrontation also alerts Sindhu of Bhairavi's knowledge of the affair. 6. As the plot thickens, Sindhu, fearing the repercussions of their affair getting exposed, decides to leave the city. JKB, on the other hand, is left to face the consequences of his actions and attempts to mend the broken relationship with Bhairavi. 7. In the end, JKB acknowledges his mistakes, and although the trust between him and Bhairavi is severely damaged, they decide to work on rebuilding their relationship. The movie ends on a note of hope with the possibility of redemption for the characters. Step 3: Justification of the steps Developing the plot around the given information primarily focuses on the relationship dynamics between the three main characters. Incorporating elements of drama, betrayal, and conflict serve to create an engaging movie plot that will keep the audience hooked. By following the character development and story progression, the plot provides a comprehensive and believable narrative that addresses the given situation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who was alienated from Johnson due to doubts concerning the 1965 bombing of North Vietnam?  Hubert Humphrey was a Minnesotan who became a nationally prominent politician. He first ran for mayor of Minneapolis in 1943, but lost the election to the Republican candidate by just a few thousand votes.  As a Democrat, Humphrey recognized that his best chance for political success was to obtain the support of the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party.  Other members of the Farmer-Labor Party had been considering the idea, as encouraged by Franklin D. Roosevelt, but the merger only became reality after Humphrey traveled to Washington, D.C. to discuss the issue.  Rather than simply absorbing the Farmer-Labor party, with its constituency of 200,000 voters, Humphrey suggested calling the party the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.  He was elected mayor of Minneapolis in 1945, and one of his first actions was to propose an ordinance making racial discrimination by employers subject to a fine.  This ordinance was adopted in 1947, and although few fines were issued, the city's banks and department stores realized that public relations would improve by hiring blacks in increasing numbers. Humphrey delivered an impassioned speech at the 1948 Democratic National Convention encouraging the party to adopt a civil rights plank in their platform.  He was elected to the United States Senate in 1948 and was re-elected in 1954 and 1960.In the early 1960s, the topic of civil rights was coming to national prominence with sit-ins and marches organized by Martin Luther King Jr. and other black leaders.  In 1963, President John F. Kennedy sent a comprehensive civil rights bill to Congress, based largely on the ideas that Humphrey had been placing before the Senate for the previous fifteen years.  The bill passed the House in early 1964, but passage through the Senate was more difficult, due to southern segregationists who filibustered for 75 days.  Finally, in June 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 became law.  Humphrey called this his greatest achievement. Lyndon B. Johnson recruited Humphrey for his running mate in the 1964...

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Background: Columbus Delano, (June 4, 1809 - October 23, 1896) was a lawyer, rancher, banker, statesman and a member of the prominent Delano family. Delano was elected U.S. Congressman from Ohio, serving two full terms and one partial one. Prior to the American Civil War, Delano was a National Republican and then a Whig; as a Whig he was identified with the faction of the party that opposed the spread of slavery into the Western territories, and he became a Republican when the party was founded as the major anti-slavery party after the demise of the Whigs in the 1850s. During Reconstruction Delano advocated federal protection of African-Americans civil rights, and argued that the former Confederate states should be administered by the federal government, but were not part of the United States until they met the requirements for readmission to the Union. Context: In 1875, Delano's reputation for personal honesty came under increasing scrutiny as revelations of corruption in the Grant administration continued to be the subject of investigations and media revelations. Westerners unhappy with Delano's rulings on land grants and other issues accused Delano's son John, an employee of the Interior Department, of corruption, bribery, and fraud. Governor Edward M. McCook of the Colorado Territory, claimed that John Delano had accepted a 1,200 bribe from a Colorado banker, Jerome B. Chaffee, to secure land patents from the Department of Interior.  The New-York Tribune reported that John Delano was profiteering through Interior's Office of the Surveyor General by accepting partnerships in Wyoming surveying contracts without having been trained in surveying or map making, and without providing any meaningful contribution to the fulfillment of the contracts; the obvious implication was John Delano had taken extortion money from illicit contract agreements. In March 1875, the former chief clerk of the Surveyor's Office, L. C. Stevens, wrote to Benjamin Bristow, Grant's Secretary of the Treasury, stating that Surveyor General Silas Reed had made several corrupt contracts which financially benefited John Delano. Stevens also said both Reed and John Delano had blackmailed five deputy surveyors for 5,000. More damaging was Stevens' charge that Columbus Delano knew and approved of what Reed had done for John Delano.  Both Bristow and Secretary of State Hamilton Fish demanded that Grant fire Delano. Grant declined, telling Fish, \\"If Delano were now to resign, it would be retreating under fire and be accepted as an admission of the charges.\\" The controversy did not abate; by mid-August it became clear that Delano could not remain in office; Delano offered his resignation and Grant accepted, but Grant did not make it public. Grant finally announced his acceptance of Delano's resignation on October 19, 1875, after Bristow threatened to resign if Delano was not replaced. Grant replaced Delano with Zachariah Chandler, who quickly initiated civil service and other reforms in the Department of the Interior. Delano's administration was investigated by Congress, Chandler, and a special presidential commission; his personal conduct was exonerated, but his reputation as an honest, capable administrator was damaged, and Delano never again ran for office or served in an appointed one. In April 1876, The Committee on the Expeditures in the Interior Department confirmed that Reed had set up an illicit slush fund for John Delano's financial benefit, and that Delano thanked Reed while also telling him \\"to be careful to do nothing that would have the semblance of wrong.\\" Question: what was the corruption?. Whats the answer?","output":"The corruption allegations against Columbus Delano and his son, John Delano, revolved around several misconducts in connection with the Interior Department of the U.S. government in the mid 1870s. The primary charges against Columbus Delano's son John Delano were of corruption, bribery, fraud, and profiteering, all committed while he was an employee of the Interior Department, primarily operating under the Office of the Surveyor General.  Governor Edward M. McCook accused John Delano of accepting a 1,200 bribe from a Colorado banker, Jerome B. Chaffee, in exchange for securing land patents through the Department of Interior, implicating Delano family's unlawful use of public office for private gains. John Delano was also accused of profiteering, as he accepted partnerships in Wyoming surveying contracts despite having no relevant expertise in surveying or mapmaking, and without making any significant contribution towards fulfilling those contracts. This suggested that he was making illicit contract agreements and effectively taking extortion money. Furthermore, the former chief clerk of the Surveyor's Office, L. C. Stevens, claimed that John Delano and Surveyor General Silas Reed had engaged in several corrupt contracts that ultimately benefited John Delano financially. Stevens further alleged that Reed and John Delano had blackmailed five deputy surveyors for 5,000.  The most damaging charge, however, was probably Stevens' assertion that Columbus Delano not only knew about these corrupt actions but also approved of what Reed and his son John had done. Such allegations cast serious doubt on Delano's integrity as an administrator, effectively discrediting his claim of personal honesty and commitment to fair governance. These allegations led to investigations by Benjamin Bristow, the Grant administration's Secretary of the Treasury, and Secretary of State Hamilton Fish. The ensuing political turmoil led to the resignation of Columbus Delano, and his replacement by Zachariah Chandler, who initiated substantial civil service and other reforms in the Department of the Interior. While Columbus Delano was not personally found guilty of corruption, his administration was implicated and his reputation was tarnished due to his perceived complicity in the aforementioned practices of his son and Surveyor General Silas Reed. In April 1876, the Committee on the Expenditures in the Interior Department confirmed that Silas Reed had indeed set up an illicit slush fund for the financial benefit of John Delano, and that Columbus Delano, while cautioning Reed to avoid indiscretion, had effectively endorsed these malpractices. The corruption controversies and his resultant resignation marked the end of Delano's political career."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Options: - buy a train ticket - create art - apply for job - take care of proposals - stand in line Answer:","output":"The boss gave him the money to appease the clients, and based on the provided options, the most logical and common-sense choice would be for him to \\"take care of proposals.\\" The reasoning behind choosing this option comes from a deeper understanding of the context and an evaluation of the implications of the other options. The primary goal, as stated in the question, is to appease the clients. In a professional setting, this often means addressing their concerns, meeting their needs, and making sure they are satisfied with the services or products provided. A thorough analysis of the given options helps to clarify why \\"take care of proposals\\" would be the best fit in this case: 1. \\"Buy a train ticket\\": There is no context suggesting that he needs to travel to address the clients' needs or concerns. While it might be possible that buying a train ticket could be part of a bigger strategy, it appears to be unrelated to appeasing the clients directly. 2. \\"Create art\\": Unless the person is working in a creative industry where art plays a significant role in client satisfaction, creating art is likely not the primary method to appease clients in a professional context. It might serve as a good gesture or show creativity, but it doesn't directly address their concerns or requirements. 3. \\"Apply for a job\\": Applying for a job is entirely unrelated to the task of appeasing clients. It doesn't provide any means of addressing their concerns or ensuring satisfaction with the services or products offered. 4. \\"Stand in line\\": This option is ambiguous and unrelated to the primary task of appeasing clients. It does not provide any context or indication as to how standing in line would accomplish the goal of addressing client concerns or needs. In summary, considering the context and goal of appeasing clients, the most appropriate action based on common sense amongst the provided options is for him to \\"take care of proposals.\\" This choice implies that the person would be drafting, revising, or presenting proposals to address client concerns or requirements, offering a solution that is likely to lead to improved client satisfaction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are possible answers to this question: - closet - chest - drawer - dresser - suitcase  I believe the correct choice is \\"drawer\\", here's why: A:","output":"The correct choice is indeed \\"drawer.\\" Here's a detailed explanation: In the context of the sentence, John is looking for a shirt, which would typically be stored in a piece of furniture designed for holding clothing items. The possible answers provided are: 1. Closet: Though shirts can be hung in closets, the action of \\"pulling open\\" does not match with the general motion of opening a closet door, which typically involves turning a doorknob and either pulling or pushing the door open. 2. Chest: While a chest can store various items, it usually has a lid or top that is lifted, rather than being pulled open. 3. Drawer: This is the most logical choice, as drawers are common storage spaces for clothing items such as shirts. Additionally, the action of \\"pulling open\\" accurately describes how one would open a drawer. 4. Dresser: A dresser contains drawers for storing clothes, but the question specifically refers to what John pulled open, which would be the drawer rather than the dresser itself. 5. Suitcase: While shirts can be stored in a suitcase (primarily during travel), the context of the sentence does not indicate that John is traveling or needs to access his clothing within a suitcase. Because the action of \\"pulling open\\" matches the way in which drawers are typically opened and the context of the question suggests that John is trying to retrieve an item of clothing, \\"drawer\\" is the most appropriate and accurate answer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: In this courtroom sketch from Monday, Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, center, sits stone-faced during court proceedings. While the Twin Towers still burned, on the afternoon of Sept. 11, 2001, Osama Bin Laden turned for help to someone he knew he could trust, a prosecutor said Wednesday just blocks from Ground Zero. The Al Qaeda boss turned to son-in-law Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, the prosecutor said. RELATED: JURY BEING SELECTED FOR OSAMA BIN LADEN’S SON-IN-LAW “He needed the world to know that his organization was responsible,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas Lewin thundered in an opening statement for Abu Ghaith's terrorism trial in Manhattan Federal Court. “Literally moments after the attacks of Sept. 11, Osama Bin Laden turned to this man,” Lewin said, pointing to Abu Ghaith, who sat stone-faced in a dark suit and blue silk tie. “Osama Bin Laden asked that man to deliver Al Qaeda’s murderous decree to the entire world. What did the defendant do? He agreed.” RELATED: TRIAL OF OSAMA'S SON-IN-LAW STARTS MONDAY Lewin showed a jury of nine women and three men a photo taken from an Al Qaeda propaganda video Abu Ghaith made with Bin Laden outside a cave in Afghanistan on Sept. 12, 2001. “This is Osama Bin Laden. This is this man,” the prosecutor said. “This is on Sept. 12, 2001. It was the most important moment in Al Qaeda’s savage history.” Abu Ghaith, 48, a Muslim cleric from Kuwait said to be the high-ranking Al Qaeda figure tried on U.S. soil since the 9/11 attacks, is charged with conspiring to kill Americans and with providing support to terrorists in his role as an Al Qaeda spokesman. The feds claim Abu Ghaith rallied Al Qaeda terrorists at training camps in Afghanistan and recruited new fighters to the organization with his speeches. RELATED: BIN LADEN'S SON-IN-LAW FAILS TO GET TERRORISM CHARGES DROPPED He faces up to life in prison if convicted. His trial is expected to last about three weeks. Defense lawyer Stanley Cohen heaped scorn on the prosecution’s case after listening to Lewin address the jury Wednesday. RELATED: ‘NOT A SHRED OF EVIDENCE’ TO SUPPORT OSAMA BIN LADEN SON-IN-LAW’S SURVEILLANCE FEARS: JUDGE “You’ve just been to the movies, ladies and gentlemen,” Cohen said. The lawyer conceded the horror of the 9/11 attacks and admitted his client spouted hate in the aftermath of the disaster. RELATED: OSAMA BIN LADEN'S SON-IN-LAW WANTS TO DUMP ATTORNEY FOR NEW LAWYER “These words are terrible. They’re dumb. … They’ll outrage you. They should,” Cohen said. “9/11 hangs heavy over this courtroom.” But the lawyer told the jury, “This is not about Osama Bin Laden and this is not a trial about the plot of 9/11” because Abu Ghaith isn’t accused of plotting the 9/11 attacks. RELATED: TERROR TRIAL DELAYED BY SEQUESTRATION The case will boil down to mere “words and association,” rather than hard evidence of wrongdoing, Cohen said, telling jurors that his client is a human being, not a monster. “He’s a Muslim. He’s an Arab ... He’s a husband. He’s a father,” the lawyer said. “There’s really no evidence (of guilt). There’s a substitution of evidence with fright.” RELATED: BIN LADEN’S SON-IN-LAW ABU GHAITH PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO 9/11 PLOTTING Making a comparison between Abu Ghaith and Thomas Preston, a British soldier acquitted in the Boston Massacre of 1770 after being defended at trial by future president John Adams, Cohen urged the jury to “prove our greatness” as a country. “That jury in that important case … returned a verdict of not guilty and everyone was stunned,” Cohen said. “You have the same tenacity … to do what that jury did do.” The trial will feature testimony from two onetime Al Qaeda operatives now cooperating with the feds, said Lewin, the prosecutor. The first, known to be Saajid Badat, is a British man who plotted with “shoe bomber” Richard Reid and who will testify next week via video feed from Britain. The second is a man from upstate New York who spent time in Afghanistan and will tell jurors that he heard Abu Ghaith preach holy war. The defendant was referring to upcoming Al Qaeda shoe bomb attacks like the one Reid attempted when he recorded a post-9/11 propaganda video with the message, “The storm of airplanes will not stop,” Lewin said. “You will watch the defendant committing his crimes,” the prosecutor told jurors, promising to show them the many videos Abu Ghaith made in 2001 and 2002. The two cooperating witnesses are not credible, Cohen countered.

The research by scientists at the University of California is published in the journal ACS Nano. Medical applications for micro-machines include the release of drugs into specific locations within the body. But until now, they have only been tested in laboratory cell samples. A team led by Professors Liangfang Zhang and Joseph Wang from UC, San Diego fed the tiny motors to mice. The machines, made of polymer tubes coated with zinc, are just 20 micrometres long - the width of a strand of human hair. In stomach acid, the zinc reacts to produce bubbles of hydrogen, which propel the machines into the lining of the stomach, where they attach. As the machines dissolve, they deliver their cargoes into the stomach tissue. The researchers say the method may offer an efficient way to deliver drugs into the stomach, to treat peptic ulcers and other illnesses. In their paper, they suggest that further work is needed to \\"further evaluate the performance and functionalities of various man-made micro-motors in living organisms. This study represents the very first step toward such a goal\\". The idea of surgery on a tiny scale can be traced back to a lecture by celebrated physicist Richard Feynman in 1959 called There is Plenty of Room at the Bottom. In the talk to the American Physical Society (APS), he explained: \\"Although it is a very wild idea, it would be interesting in surgery if you could swallow the surgeon. \\"You put the mechanical surgeon inside the blood vessel and it goes into the heart and 'looks' around. It finds out which valve is the faulty one and takes a little knife and slices it out.\\" The basic idea has found its way into science fiction, including the 1966 cult film classic Fantastic Voyage.

We see James enter a locker room where he starts to put on his spacesuit and we see another figure in a spacesuit lurking in the corner wearing a helmet so we can't see his face. James addresses the figure as Benson (Harvey Keitel). Benson has apparently just failed a mental stability exam and James is replacing him on this mission. Before James is finished putting on his suit, however, Benson straps himself down and opens the airlock venting the locker room. James is killed and his body flushed out into space. Benson closes the door and then takes James's place on the mission.Benson flies the ship through the rings of Saturn and lands it on a moon at the Saturn 3 experimental food station. It is a remote and isolated underground facility crewed by just two scientists: the older Adam (played by a 64 year-old Kirk Douglas) and the beautiful young Alex (played by a 33 year-old Farrah Fawcett).

The context of the question revolves around the individual having a busy schedule, which likely includes a mix of professional and personal responsibilities. The question implies that there is an immediate need to start attending to her responsibilities, specifically running errands and picking up the kids, as soon as she completes a particular task. Out of all the options presented, Option D, \\"leave work,\\" is the most aligned with the situation described. Work is a part of many people's daily routine and an individual's ability to attend to personal matters is often limited or postponed until after their professional obligations have been met. Once she leaves work, it is a natural transition for her to start addressing her personal tasks, such as running errands and picking up the kids. Option A, \\"make time for,\\" could seem reasonable, but it is not specific enough. Making time could be related to various activities or events and does not necessarily indicate an endpoint to her professional obligations. Option B, \\"take money,\\" is irrelevant to the context and lacks any connection to her daily schedule, errands, or picking up the kids. It also does not clearly indicate when she can start attending to her personal tasks. Option C, \\"go outdoors,\\" can be considered too vague and not directly related to her schedule, errands, or picking up the kids. Going outdoors could be part of her daily routine, but it does not necessarily mean she has finished her work or is ready to attend to personal matters. Lastly, Option E, \\"field,\\" is not a relevant or coherent choice for the question as it is just a noun and does not provide any clear indication of how it is related to her busy schedule or the completion of a specific task.

All organised opposition is banned in Cuba and all candidates for elections have been selected by the ruling Communist Party or its affiliated associations.      More than 600 delegates will take their seats in the National Assembly and approve the candidates for Cuba's key political positions.      With President Raul Castro - Fidel's younger brother - already 81, Cubans are watching for any sign as to who might follow him, our correspondent says.

HAVANA Retired Cuban leader Fidel Castro voted in Cuba's general election on Sunday and chatted with well wishers and Cuban reporters in Havana for more than an hour, in his first extended public appearance since 2010.      Castro had voted from his home in three previous elections since taking ill in 2006 and ceding power to his brother Raul two years later.      A stooped, snow white bearded Castro, 86, was seen on state-run television as he cast his ballot in the late afternoon, wearing a blue plaid shirt and light blue jacket.      The announcer said Castro talked about efforts to reform the economy, Latin American integration, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and other matters.      He was heard in a weak voice praising popular participation in Sunday's election.      \\"The people are truly revolutionary, they have really sacrificed. We don't have to prove it, history will. Fifty years of the blockade and they haven't given in,\\" he said.      Cubans went to the polls to elect a Communist Party-selected slate of 612 deputies to the National Assembly and more than 1,000 delegates to provincial assemblies, at a time of change in how they live and work, but not in how they vote.      President Raul Castro and other leaders were also shown on television casting their ballots and commenting on the importance of the election as a show of support for reforms and independence from the United States.      Raul Castro is decentralizing the state-dominated economy, allowing more space for private initiative in agriculture and retail services and has lifted many restrictions on personal freedoms, such as travel and buying and selling homes and cars.      He has also introduced term limits (two five-year stints) for top government posts, but has drawn the line at legalizing other political parties and contested elections.      \\"Renouncing the principle of a single party would be equal to legalizing one or more imperialist parties,\\" Castro said at a Party conference last year.      He insisted critics, and even some friends, did not take into account the \\"abnormal state of siege\\" the country is experiencing.      \\"The one-party elections in Cuba, alongside steady but slow progress on opening the economy, represent how the current regime intends to manage change on the island - giving the people more space to participate in the economy while controlling their role in politics and civic life,\\" said Ted Piccone, deputy director of foreign policy at the Washington-based Brookings Institution.      Some 95 percent of Cuba's 8.7 million residents over 16 years of age were expected to cast ballots with polling stations on just about every block and where abstention is frowned on.      'ALL REVOLUTIONARIES'      Reuters talked with more than half a dozen voters before they entered the polls in Havana. None of them knew the candidates on the national slate from their districts.      \\"What's certain is they are all revolutionaries and that's what matters,\\" said retiree Eduardo Sanchez.      \\"I vote because I feel I have to, and it doesn't really matter because the deputies have no power anyway,\\" said one young woman, who declined to give her name.      The curious read biographies of candidates posted at the polls, then cast paper ballots in cardboard voting boxes guarded by school students.      Others simply entered the polls and checked a box for the entire slate.      The candidates were equal to the number of positions up for a vote, the only choice being to not vote for a certain candidate or leave blank or spoil one's ballot.      The deputies are elected for five-year terms.      The new assembly will meet this month to approve a party-proposed slate for the Council of State, which Raul Castro is expected to head for his second term. Council of State members must be deputies.      The general election cycle began last year with the election of more than 15,000 ward delegates in the only vote in which residents choose between two or more candidates.      Party-controlled commissions then selected candidates for provincial assemblies and the single-chamber national assembly, at least 50 percent of whom must be ward delegates and the remainder officials and personalities from the arts, sports and other sectors.      The National Assembly usually meets just twice a year for a week of committee and plenary meetings, though deputies remain engaged between sessions while working their normal jobs and can be relieved from work for assembly tasks.

State TV showed the 86-year-old Castro voting at a polling station, where he reportedly spent up to an hour talking to other voters and the media. The elections saw more than 600 delegates taking seats in the National Assembly and approving candidates for Cuba's key political positions. The selection of vice-presidents and ministers could potentially indicate who is being groomed to carry on the revolution. All organized opposition is banned in Cuba, and all candidates for elections have been chosen by the ruling Communist Party or its affiliated associations. The Castro family, including former leader Fidel Castro and current President Raul Castro, have been key figures in Cuba's politics for decades."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Select the topic that this about: Microsoft Corp. #39;s MSN Music online download service fired another salvo this week at Apple rival iTunes Music Store by announcing its expansion into new European countries.","output":"The topic of discussion is the expansion of Microsoft Corp.'s online music download service, MSN Music, into new European countries, as a direct competition to Apple's popular iTunes Music Store. This strategic move by Microsoft aimed at capturing a share in the growing online music market and challenging Apple's dominance in the sector. MSN Music was an online music store that Microsoft Corporation launched in 2004. It was specifically designed to compete with Apple's iTunes Music Store, which had become the industry leader in digital music sales. MSN Music allowed users to purchase songs individually or as part of an album, download and listen to them on their computers or portable devices, and manage their digital music library. As part of its expansion strategy, Microsoft decided to enhance MSN Music's offerings and services in several new European countries. This decision was made to ensure a broader audience and customer base for the platform, allowing Microsoft to compete more effectively with iTunes Music Store in the European market. This expansion incorporated numerous factors, such as: 1. Localization: Microsoft focused on adapting MSN Music to the specific preferences and needs of customers in each country by offering localized content, including popular songs and albums from local artists, as well as international hits. This ensured that MSN Music would be more appealing to local users, by providing a tailored experience based on their tastes and interests. 2. Pricing and currencies: To make the online music store more accessible and user-friendly, Microsoft adjusted the pricing of songs and albums on MSN Music to match the local currency, thus making it easier for customers to understand and compare costs. This approach also eliminated potential confusion arising from currency conversions. 3. Partnerships: To facilitate its expansion, Microsoft formed partnerships with local music rights holders, record labels, and distributors. These partnerships enabled MSN Music to offer an extensive range of music, tapping into the resources of both local and international artists, thereby increasing its library's appeal to a broader audience. 4. Marketing and promotional efforts: Microsoft invested in marketing campaigns and promotional activities to raise awareness and create excitement around the MSN Music brand in the targeted European countries. This included advertising, events, collaborations with local influencers, and social media initiatives, all aimed at attracting users to the platform and increasing downloads. 5. Platform compatibility: To ensure seamless integration with the existing Microsoft ecosystem, MSN Music was made compatible with Windows Media Player, Xbox, and other Microsoft devices. This allowed users to sync their music library easily across their devices, thus providing a convenient and integrated experience. Microsoft's expansion of MSN Music into new European countries was a strategic move that directly targeted Apple's iTunes Music Store, aspiring to challenge its dominance in the digital music market and secure a larger share of this rapidly growing industry. However, despite Microsoft's efforts, MSN Music ultimately did not have the same staying power as iTunes, and the service was eventually shut down in 2008."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Anti-Nazi Resolution UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United States was one of three countries to vote against a U.N. resolution condemning the glorification of Nazism on Thursday, citing freedom of speech issues and concerns that Russia was using it to carry out political attacks against its neighbors. The resolution entitled “Combating glorification of Nazism, Neo-Nazism and other practices that contribute to fueling contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,” was approved by the U.N.’s human rights committee on Friday with 131 in favor, 3 against with 48 abstentions. Ukraine and Palau were the other no votes. “We condemn without reservation all forms of religious and ethnic intolerance or hatred at home and around the world,” said Deputy U.S. Representative to the Economic and Social Council Stefanie Amadeo, explaining the U.S. vote. “However, due to this resolution’s overly narrow scope and politicized nature, and because it calls for unacceptable limits on the fundamental freedom of expression, the United States cannot support it,” Amadeo said. She said the U.S. also disagrees with the resolution’s willingness to curb freedom of expression even while sharing its concerns about the rise of hate speech around the world. “This resolution’s recommendations to limit freedom of expression, freedom of association, and the right to peaceful assembly contravene the principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and must be opposed,” Amadeo said. Unlike resolutions in the Security Council, resolutions in General Assembly committees are not considered legally binding. Summary:","output":"The United States, along with Ukraine and Palau, voted against a United Nations (UN) resolution that says bad things about Nazism. This resolution wants to stop people from saying good things about Nazis and other groups that are mean to people because of their race or where they come from. The United States said no to this because they think people should be allowed to say what they want, even if it's not nice. They also think that the resolution focuses too much on one issue and is being used by some countries for their own reasons. The UN's human rights group agreed with the resolution, but the United States and two other countries did not."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What type of music was \\"Big Fun\\"?  Detroit techno is an offshoot of Chicago house music which developed in the early and mid-1980s. One of the earliest hits was \\"Big Fun\\" by Inner City. Detroit techno developed as the DJ The Electrifying Mojo did his radio program, which fused eclectic sounds into the signature Detroit techno sound. This sound, also influenced by European electronica (Kraftwerk, Art of Noise), Japanese synthpop (Yellow Magic Orchestra), early B-boy (breakdancing) Hip-Hop (Man Parrish, Soul Sonic Force) and Italo disco (Doctor's Cat, Ris, Klein M.B.O.), was further pioneered by Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson, known as the Belleville Three. Derrick May a.k.a. \\"MAYDAY\\" and Thomas Barnett released \\"Nude Photo\\" in 1987 on May's label \\"Transmat Records\\", which helped start the Detroit techno music scene. This record was played on Chicago's Hot Mix 5 Radio DJ mix show and in Chicago clubs. A year later, Transmat released \\"Strings of Life\\". Transmat Records also released such as 1988's \\"Wiggin\\". As well, Derrick May had releases on Kool Kat Records and many remixes for underground and mainstream recording artists. Kevin Saunderson's company KMS Records contributed many releases that were as much house music as they were techno. These tracks were well received in Chicago and played on Chicago radio and in clubs.Blake Baxter's 1986 recording, \\"When we Used to Play / Work your Body\\", 1987's \\"Bounce Your Body to the Box\\" and \\"Force Field\\", \\"The Sound / How to Play our Music\\" and \\"the Groove that Won't Stop\\" and a remix of \\"Grooving Without a Doubt\\". In 1988, as house music became more popular among general audiences, Kevin Saunderson's group Inner City with Paris Gray released the 1988 hits \\"Big Fun\\" and \\"Good Life\\", which eventually were picked up by Virgin Records. Each EP / 12 inch single sported remixes by Mike \\"Hitman\\" Wilson and Steve \\"Silk\\" Hurley of Chicago and Derrick \\"Mayday\\" May and Juan Atkins of Detroit.

Media playback is not supported on this device After losing the first leg of their semi-final 1-0 in Villarreal, Liverpool produced a dominant display at Anfield on Thursday to win 3-1 on aggregate. \\"When you perform like we did then you want to have it all and that is what we will try,\\" said Klopp. \\"We will go there and try to do everything for this wonderful club.\\" The match - at St Jakob-Park in Basel, Switzerland - will be Liverpool's first European final since losing 2-1 to AC Milan in the Champions League in 2007. The Reds have won eight of the 11 European finals they have appeared in - five of seven in the European Cup/Champions League and three of three in the Uefa Cup/Europa League. Should they beat Sevilla, who are trying to win the Europa League for the third successive season, they will join the Spanish side as the most successful in the competition with four victories and earn a place in next season's Champions League. \\"I don't know what it means that it is nine years between Liverpool's last final,\\" said Klopp, who replaced Brendan Rodgers as manager in October. \\"A lot of teams want to go to finals, it is not too easy, but it is a real opportunity and we will take the opportunity.\\" An early Bruno Soriano own goal set Liverpool on their way, before second-half strikes from Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana completed victory over their Spanish opponents, who finished the match with 10 men after Victor Ruiz was sent off. Liverpool, Champions League winners in 2005, were backed by impressive support from the moment the team bus arrived at the stadium. Hundreds of fans packed Anfield Road to welcome their players and continued their vociferous support throughout the game. Klopp says as many as 100,000 Liverpool fans could travel to Switzerland for the final, though FC Basel's stadium can only hold 35,000. Klopp did not name a recognised striker in his starting line-up for the first leg, with Sturridge left on the bench. However, he restored the England international to the first XI and was rewarded with an impressive performance. Sturridge scored Liverpool's second after being the closest Reds player to Soriano when he put through his own net - and he was also involved in Lallana's goal. Klopp said the 26-year-old had a \\"great game\\", adding: \\"When Daniel Sturridge is fit he is an unbelievable striker, but even he needs players to play with and I know about his quality, I knew before I came here. Great player.\\" Liverpool produced another memorable European performance at Anfield, after coming from 3-1 down to knock Borussia Dortmund out in the previous round. It means Klopp is into his second final with the club since taking charge just seven months ago. They lost on penalties to Manchester City in the League Cup final in February. \\"In 2016, the team have shown a lot of times what they could be capable of in the future so that's a good sign and that is more important for me as a manager,\\" said Klopp. Former Liverpool striker Michael Owen said on BT Sport: \\"Over the last few months we've really seen something special. \\"There's such high energy levels, the pressing we all knew Jurgen Klopp was going to bring over. But he's just improving players - the likes of Adam Lallana, Simon Mignolet and Dejan Lovren - as well. \\"There's special times ahead. It's almost like they are unbeatable here. It's becoming a fortress.\\"","output":"Liverpool advances to the Europa League final after defeating Villarreal 3-1, with Daniel Sturridge, Bruno Soriano, Adam Lallana all contributing to the win, setting up a match against Sevilla in Switzerland."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

There are several funny moments, and some interesting points, but don't go into this expecting an even-handed discussion of religion. This is what I consider to be the worst kind of documentary - Everything is arranged ahead of time and in editing to provide you with the opinion of the director, rather than letting you make your own decision. EDITING - It's very chopped up, inter-spliced with clips from pop culture and the media to reinforce the point. The interviewee barely has a chance to finish a sentence before he is interrupted by the editing. The only people given a fair chance to speak their mind are those who say what Bill Maher wants them to say. Once someone deviates from the gospel according to Maher, they get edited. INTERVIEWEES - They are meant to represent the absolute MOST extremist religions. From the TV evangelical to the ultimate Jewish stereotype, to a TRUCK STOP chapel (Seriously. A TRUCK STOP CHAPEL). He's picked the worst money-grabbers, the heavy extremists, and those who don't have the budget to say no to pick on. And when he does get a good person to interview, he edits the hell out of them. STEREOTYPING - All religions are portrayed as stereotypes. Especially hard hit are the Muslims. During the Muslim segment, he barely gives anyone the chance to speak before interrupting them either himself, or through editing in pieces with suicide bombers. ALL Muslims are portrayed as gun-toting extremists through the editing, and none of the people interviewed is edited fairly. ENDING - The message at the end is INCREDIBLY heavy-handed, and while it is an interesting idea, it's not presented with fairness to the countless people who are not religious extremists. Bill Maher explains himself while clips of destruction play in the foreground. This literally gives the message that religion is stupid and dangerous, and that it will destroy the world. He also states that everyone involved in religion is stupid. With the faults to the film, it has some good points, and the humor, while very unfair, is actually funny. But know going in, it is a very one-sided view, Bill Maher's view, of religion. He's not discovering anything. He's telling you what he thinks. 4/10 - Some good moments, but heavy-handed with an extremely irresponsible documentary style.

It refers to a woman who is dangerously attractive, and lures men to their downfall with her sexual attractiveness. In both incarnations of Madame White snake, the authors depict her as bewitchingly beautiful. Toyoo, her human lover in \\"Lust of the White Serpant\\" cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind and dreams of her, and finds himself \\"disturbed and agitated\\" by her \\"ethereal beauty\\". In \\"Eternal Prisoner,\\" Madame White Snake's bewitching beauty follows her lover Hsü into his dreams, and the next morning \\"he was so distracted that he could not concentrate on doing business.\\" Both of these stories align negative connotations with her beauty, suggesting that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction. In addition to distracting sexuality, the irregular characterization of Madame White Snake might be another trait her character has in common with the archetypical noir femme fatale. In her essay analyzing the noir film from a feminist perspective, Christine Gledhill writes \\"Not only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman is honest or a deceiver, but the heroine's characterisation is itself fractured so that it is not evident to the audience whether she fills the [femme fatale] stereotype or not\\".

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake. During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife. Mysteriously, the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d.

Article: During the Victorian period, ordinary people started going on holidays to the seaside for the first time.    When a woman entered a room, it was considered rude for a man to offer his seat to her because the cushion  might still be warm.   People thought that you could digest food better in the dark, so the dining room was often located in the basement.   It was considered improper to look into someone's bedroom, so most bedrooms were on the second or third floor.   People went to great lengths to hide their water closets from view. In some homes, they were behind a curtain or screen, in a separate part of the house or even outside.   A lot of men used macassar oil to slick back their hair. In order to stop this grease from sticking to the furniture, pieces of material called antimacassars were placed over the backs of chairs.   For a lady, to show her ankles was considered taboo . ks5u   Many people kept a hedgehog  in the basement so it could eat insects.   When Queen Victoria came to the power in 1837, most people lived in villages and worked on the land. There was no electricity (gas lamps or candles were used for light) and most people walked or traveled by boat, train and horse. However, by the end of her reign  in 1901, the majority of the population lived in towns and worked in offices, shops and factories, and there was piped water, gas and even electricity.

Speciation events: As mentioned in the question, speciation events are examples of macroevolution. They show the formation of new species over time, which is an illustration of evolution above the species level. 2. Leptospirosis: Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that affects humans and animals, but it does not show evolution over geologic time above the level of the species. It is not relevant to macroevolution. 3. Cliffs: Cliffs are geological formations that could potentially provide evidence of macroevolution through the study of various rock layers and fossils, although they are not an example of macroevolution themselves. 4. Rapid expansion: Rapid expansion can be a process in which species experience fast population growth or territory expansion. While this could potentially result in speciation events over time, the term itself is not specific enough to directly illustrate macroevolution. 5. Peachleaf willow: Peachleaf willow is a specific plant species (Salix amygdaloides).

The prince locates the tree in the territory of an evil dwarf, who offers to give him the enchanted tree, on the understanding that, if the princess still rejects him, he will be in the dwarf's power and will be turned into a bear. Because the tree will only sing and ring when the princess falls in love with the prince, she is disappointed in it and continues to reject the prince. The prince is forced to return to the dwarf's lair and is turned into a bear. The princess sends her father to find the singing ringing tree for her, but he is met by the prince, in the guise of a bear, who gives him the tree on condition that the king returns with the first thing the king sees on his return. This turns out to be the princess, who is now delivered into the hands of the dwarf. The dwarf, seeing the princess's self-centred behaviour, casts a spell to make her ugly. The bear tells her that she will regain her beauty only if she changes her ways. Gradually she is won over by the bear and becomes beautiful again. Despite the dwarf's attempts to keep her and the prince apart, she eventually falls in love with him and the singing ringing tree finally lives up to its name.","output":"In the movie \\"The Singing Ringing Tree\\", the princess ends the magical winter by gradually changing her self-centered behavior, becoming less selfish and haughty, and eventually falling in love with the prince who was turned into a bear.

Does the sentence \\"Epigenetic changes may be temporary or may remain through successive cell divisions for the remainder of the cell's life.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"Are the changes then presented, permanent?\\"","output":"The sentence \\"Epigenetic changes may be temporary or may remain through successive cell divisions for the remainder of the cell's life.\\" partially answers the question \\"Are the changes then presented, permanent?\\" But to give a more detailed and comprehensive answer, it is important to understand the concept of epigenetics and the nature of epigenetic changes. Epigenetics refers to changes in gene expression and function that are not caused by alterations in the DNA sequence itself but rather by chemical modifications to DNA and histone proteins or the action of small regulatory RNAs. These modifications act like \\"switches\\" that turn genes on or off, and consequently, they affect how genes are expressed. Epigenetic changes can be influenced by various factors, including environmental factors, lifestyle choices, and exposure to toxins. Now, let's address the question of whether these changes are permanent or not. Epigenetic changes can display different degrees of stability and persistence. Some changes may last for a relatively short period, while others might persist through multiple cell divisions or even for the entire life of an organism. Moreover, some epigenetic changes can even be passed on to future generations through a phenomenon called epigenetic inheritance. There are three primary categories of epigenetic modifications that determine the stability and permanence of the changes: 1. Temporary changes: Some epigenetic changes are transient and can be reversed with time or under specific conditions. For example, certain changes related to environmental exposures might only last for a few hours or days before the cells return to their normal state. 2. Cell division-dependent changes: Some epigenetic changes are more stable and can be maintained through successive cell divisions, meaning they remain for the rest of the cell's life. This type of change is more likely to persist until the cell dies or differentiates into a specialized cell type. 3. Inheritance-associated changes: The most stable epigenetic changes can be passed on to future generations, as they can be transmitted during the formation of gametes (egg and sperm cells). These changes can be considered semi-permanent in the sense that they might persist across generations but can still be susceptible to reversal or modification under certain conditions. In summary, the sentence provided offers a partially valid answer to the question about the permanence of epigenetic changes. Epigenetic changes can range from temporary to long-lasting, and in some instances, these changes can even be inherited by future generations. However, one must keep in mind that epigenetic changes are adaptable, and their permanence depends on various factors, including stability, reversibility, and their transmission through cell divisions and generations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Information:  - The Local Group is the galaxy group that includes the Milky Way. The Local Group comprises more than 54 galaxies, most of them dwarf galaxies. Its gravitational center is located somewhere between the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy. The Local Group covers a diameter of (about 10 meters) and has a binary (dumbbell) distribution. The group itself is a part of the larger Virgo Supercluster, which in turn may be a part of the Laniakea Supercluster.  - The Andromeda Galaxy, also known as Messier 31, M31, or NGC 224, is a spiral galaxy approximately 780 kiloparsecs (2.5 million light-years) from Earth. It is the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way and was often referred to as the Great Andromeda Nebula in older texts. It received its name from the area of the sky in which it appears, the constellation of Andromeda, which was named after the mythological princess Andromeda.  - In astronomy and navigation, the celestial sphere is an imaginary sphere of arbitrarily large radius, concentric with Earth. All objects in the observer's sky can be thought of as projected upon the inside surface of the celestial sphere, as if it were the underside of a dome or a hemispherical screen. The celestial sphere is a practical tool for spherical astronomy, allowing observers to plot positions of objects in the sky when their distances are unknown or unimportant.  - A constellation is formally defined as a region of the celestial sphere, with boundaries laid down by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The constellation areas mostly had their origins in Western-traditional patterns of stars from which the constellations take their names.  - Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It applies mathematics, physics, and chemistry, in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and comets; while the phenomena include supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, all astronomical phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere are within the purview of astronomy. A related but distinct subject, physical cosmology, is concerned with the study of the Universe as a whole.  - A dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) is a term in astronomy applied to low luminosity galaxies that are companions to the Milky Way and to the similar systems that are companions to the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). While similar to dwarf elliptical galaxies in appearance and properties such as little to no gas or dust or recent star formation, they are approximately spheroidal in shape, generally lower luminosity, and are recognized only as satellite galaxies in the Local Group.  - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes.  - Andromeda V is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy about 2.52 Mly away in the constellation Andromeda . Andromeda V was discovered by Armandroff et al . and published in 1998 after their analysis of the digitized version of the second Palomar Sky Survey . The metallicity of Andromeda V is above the average metallicity to luminosity ratio of the Local Group 's dwarf galaxies .  - The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains our Solar System. The descriptive \\"milky\\" is derived from the appearance from Earth of the galaxy  a band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye. The term \\"Milky Way\\" is a translation of the Latin ', from the Greek (', \\"milky circle\\"). From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe. Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis, observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies.    What is the relationship between 'andromeda v' and 'andromeda galaxy'? A:","output":"Andromeda V is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy found within the constellation Andromeda, approximately 2.52 million light-years away from Earth. It is a satellite galaxy of the Andromeda Galaxy (also known as Messier 31, M31, or NGC 224), which is a much larger spiral galaxy.

Acute lung injury is a life-threatening condition characterized by surfactant dysfunction and raised secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) activity. Varespladib is a sPLA2 inhibitor shown to be effective in animal models of acute lung injury. We aimed at investigating the effect of co-administration of surfactant and varespladib on sPLA2 activity. Alveolar macrophages were cultured and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide and then treated with either varespladib, surfactant, varespladib followed by surfactant or nothing. sPLA2 activity, free fatty acids, tumour necrosis factor- (TNF-) and protein concentrations were measured in culture supernatants. Treatment with varespladib (p=0.019) and varespladib + surfactant (p=0.013), reduced the enzyme activity by approximately 15% from the basal level measured in the untreated cultures. Surfactant, varespladib and varespladib + surfactant, respectively decreased free fatty acids by -45% (p=0.045), - 62% (p=0.009) and -48% (p=0.015), from the baseline concentration of the untreated cultures. Varespladib and poractant- co-administration reduces sPLA2 activity and free fatty acids release in cultured rat alveolar macrophages, although a clear drug synergy was not evident.

I can use this background: The Gaia hypothesis states that the biosphere is its own living organism. The hypothesis suggests that the Earth is self-regulating and tends to achieve a stable state, known as homeostasis . For example the composition of our atmosphere stays fairly consistent, providing the ideal conditions for life. When carbon dioxide levels increase in the atmosphere, plants grow more quickly. As their growth continues, they remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In this way, the amount of carbon dioxide stays fairly constant without human intervention.  Now, I have a new situation: Two neighbors Paul and Dean studied toghether often. this week they got together and Paul started studying about the Gaia hypothesis, while Dean studied Einstein's Theory of Relativity.  Answer this question please: Which person studied more about the carbon dioxide levels?","output":"Based on the background information provided and the new situation, Paul studied more about the carbon dioxide levels. This is because Paul was studying the Gaia hypothesis, which talks about the Earth as a self-regulating and living organism, and includes the discussion of how the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are regulated by the biosphere, through processes like plant growth. On the other hand, Dean studied Einstein's Theory of Relativity, which deals with the fundamental principles of physics, specifically focusing on gravity, space, and time. The Theory of Relativity is not directly related to the study of carbon dioxide levels or the processes occurring in the Earth's biosphere, as it deals with a different area of scientific inquiry. In conclusion, Paul, who studied the Gaia hypothesis, would have learned more about the carbon dioxide levels, as this subject is within the scope of his chosen area of study, whereas Dean's focus on Einstein's Theory of Relativity does not include this specific topic."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Two fifth-grade boys armed with a stolen semi-automatic gun, ammunition clip and knife plotted to kill a classmate in Washington state but were thwarted when another student informed a school employee, authorities said Thursday. The two boys, who told police they considered the girl rude and annoying, won't be tried as adults and will be in court next Wednesday for a capacity hearing, said Tim Rasmussen, the Stevens County prosecuting attorney. The two boys, ages 10 and 11, told authorities that they were also going to kill, or \\"get,\\" six more students at Fort Colville Elementary School in Colville, Washington, and even identified them from a class list provided by school employees, according to court documents. The boys' plan called for the older to stab the girl off-campus with a 3.25-inch knife last week, and the younger boy would scare off any responders with a .45-caliber Remington 1911 semi-automatic handgun, court documents said. The younger boy had been in \\"a short dating relationship\\" with the girl, but he told authorities that \\"she's rude and always made fun of me and my friends,\\" court papers said. \\"Yes, I just want her dead,\\" the younger boy told authorities. He brought the gun and knife to school, documents said. The older boy had been friends with the girl for several months, but he wanted to kill her because she picked on and annoyed him, court papers said. \\"Yes, and I wanted to kill her alone at first,\\" the older boy told a police officer. The officer noticed in his interview with the older boy that he \\"did not display any emotion or remorse during the interview,\\" court papers said. The younger boy took the gun from his older brother by finding a hidden key to the gun case kept in the brother's bedroom, and the older brother told authorities that he stole the firearm from their dead grandfather's home, court papers said. The older brother is also a juvenile, Rasmussen said. The two boys told another student two weeks earlier about the plot to kill the girl and were going to pay him 80 to keep it secret, the court filings said. The two boys were going to kill the other six students by luring them away from school one at a time, court papers said. When authorities were transporting the arrested boys to the Stevens County Courthouse, the juvenile probation department staff told a detective that they overheard the older boy telling the younger: \\"If I find out who told them about our weapons, I'm going to kill them. I don't care; when I get out of jail I'm going to come back and kill them,\\" according to court papers. Under Washington state law, children between the ages of 8 and 12 are presumed to not have a capacity to commit a crime, prosecutor Rasmussen told CNN. \\"What this hearing will determine is they will look at certain factors and try to get these children under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court,\\" Rasmussen said about next week's proceedings.

Answer:","output":"The white horse on the Nigerian coat of arms represents dignity, honor, strength, and pride - qualities that exemplify the spirit and character of the Nigerian nation. The white horse is an important and symbolic element of the coat of arms, which was officially adopted upon Nigeria's independence from the United Kingdom on October 1, 1960. The coat of arms conveys the essence and identity of the Nigerian people and reflects various aspects of the country's historical, political, and cultural values. The Nigerian coat of arms is a visual representation of Nigeria's sovereignty and unity, consisting of a black shield with a wavy silver band on a green and white field, supported by two white horses on either side. Above the shield, there is a red eagle, standing on a torse (a twisted band), and below the shield is a scroll bearing the national motto: \\"Unity and Faith, Peace and Progress\\". The white color of the horse signifies purity, innocence, and peace. The importance of peace and unity in a diverse country like Nigeria cannot be overstated, and the white horse serves as a constant reminder of this need. The presence of two white horses, one on either side of the shield, symbolizes the cohesive strength, collaboration, and stability that is necessary for Nigeria to thrive as a nation. The link between horses and dignity or honor is deeply rooted in Nigeria's history and folklore. Historically, horses have been associated with nobility, warriors, and rulers, as they were crucial in battles and frequently used as a means of transportation. In traditional Nigerian society, owning a horse was a sign of wealth, power, and high social standing. This connection to Nigerian heritage only serves to reinforce the symbolic importance of the white horse on the coat of arms. Furthermore, the horse's well-known strength and perseverance resonate with Nigeria's struggle for independence from colonial rule, as well as the challenges the country has faced and continues to face since attaining that independence. The presence of the white horse on the coat of arms thus encourages Nigerians to demonstrate resilience, determination, and courage in overcoming their challenges. In summary, the white horse on the Nigerian coat of arms represents the lofty ideals of dignity, honor, strength, and pride that underpin the country's national identity. It reminds Nigerians of the continuing need for unity, peace, and perseverance as the nation navigates its way through the challenges of the modern world. The white horse also reflects Nigeria's cultural heritage and historical values, lending further weight to the symbolic power and significance of this emblematic element."},{"instruction":"Q: Is this product review positive?

Know where else Waldo is not.\\"","output":"Title: Mastering the Art of Finding Waldo: Landmarks, Focus and Knowing Where Not to Look Introduction For decades, Where's Waldo, or Where’s Wally as he is known in some countries, has been a staple in waiting rooms, classrooms, and living rooms worldwide. The illustrated books following the bespectacled, red-striped adventurer have provided hours of amusement to the young and the young-at-heart. The challenge? To locate the elusive Waldo, his friends, and other items cleverly hidden amidst a sea of chaotic illustrations teeming with distractions. While it may appear that there's no rhyme or reason to Waldo's comings and goings, there is, in fact, a method to the madness. By understanding a few key strategies when searching for Waldo, you'll be able to spot him like a pro. In this article, we'll explore the importance of focusing on Waldo's clothes, the power of landmarks, and the value of knowing where else Waldo isn't.  Spot Waldo's Clothes Waldo's signature ensemble remains constant throughout his adventures – a red and white stripe hat, shirt, and trademark black rimmed circular glasses. These distinct features make him slightly easier to identify amidst the immense clutter and chaos of the crowd.  1. Familiarize Yourself with His Attire: To boost your chances of discovering Waldo's whereabouts, spend some time studying his attire so that you can easily spot it amongst various illustrations. Pay close attention to the pattern and layout of his stripes, as well as the shape of his glasses. This will help you quickly assess whether or not your eye is actually drawn to Waldo or a cleverly placed decoy.   2. Scan for Red and White Stripes: Use a systematic approach and scan the illustration from top to bottom and side to side. Focus on narrowing down areas containing people wearing red and white striped clothing. This will significantly reduce the amount of illustration you have to search through. 3. Watch Out for Decoys: The illustrations are specifically designed to throw off seekers with similar-looking characters, accessories, or patterns. Keep Waldo's specific attire in mind to ensure you're not misled by these decoys. Focus on Landmarks Illustrations in Where's Waldo often center around detailed landmarks rich with easily distinguishable features. Use the presence of these landmarks to your advantage: 1. Utilize Landmark Boundaries: Not only do landmarks provide you with definitive boundaries for your search area, but they also help you remember which areas you've previously scanned. This helps prevent you from wasting time revisiting the same places. 2. Organize Your Search: Divide the page into sections based on these focal points and explore one landmark at a time. This allows for a more methodical search with increased chances of success. 3. Look for Patterns: Be aware of any patterns or themes associated with the landmarks within the illustration. Characters and objects may share common features or colors with the surroundings. Recognizing these patterns can improve the chances of spotting Waldo in the midst of a busy scene. Know Where Else Waldo is Not Elimination is a powerful technique in the quest for Waldo. Being able to exclude particular areas or groups of people from your search speeds up the process of honing in on Waldo. Some crucial approaches to this include: 1. Avoid Irrelevant Characters: Illustrations usually include various characters or groups of people that are unrelated to Waldo. By concentrating on the unique features more commonly associated with Waldo, you can disregard these areas, streamlining your search. 2. Beware of Tricks: Waldo's creator, Martin Handford, has been known to include tricks in his illustrations. For instance, drawing Waldo's clothes on another character or showing only a small portion of him sticking out from behind a large object. Keep this in mind as you search to avoid being misled by these tricks. 3. Trust Your Instincts: If you've searched an area and are confident Waldo isn't hiding there, move on. Trusting your intuition and eliminating areas will assist in narrowing down the possible locations faster.  Conclusion With these tips at your fingertips, you're well on your way to mastering the art of finding Waldo. By focusing on his distinctive clothes, using landmarks to aid your search, and eliminating areas where he's not, you'll become a seasoned Waldo-hunter in no time. The next time you pick up a copy of the classic books, put these tactics to the test and watch your success rate soar.

Review: Like with any movie genre, there are good gangster movies and there are bad gangster movies. If you asked me to name a good gangster movie, I'd have dozens to choose from. If you asked me to name a bad gangster movie, probably the first one to pop up in my mind is one that still has me in a sort of depression of disappointment about a week since I saw the film for the first and I promise you, the last time. That film is \\"The General\\", unrelated to the 1926 silent film of the same name. This is a very dry, very slow gangster epic that raises questions not about the story (it's more than easy to follow) but about why the filmmakers chose to make this rather flimsy endeavor.Like \\"Goodfellas\\" (1990) and \\"American Gangster\\" (2007)two superior mob movies\\"The General\\" is based on real people and true events. The film revolves around an Irish criminal named Martin Cahill (Brendan Gleeson) who started his long chain of crimes stealing food as a teenager and then moving up to robbing museums and houses as an adult. Meanwhile, the police led by an inspector named Kenny (Jon Voight) try desperately and vigorously to prove just one of his crimes and convict (or kill) him.Perhaps because it's a film in the same category as the marvelous \\"Goodfellas\\" (1990) and the first two \\"Godfather\\" films, I was expecting too much from \\"The General.\\" But that may be going too easy on it. This would have been a bad film had I not seen the aforementioned masterpieces before being swamped by boredom in this oater and its far-too-stretched running time of screaming bad scenes. Let's start knocking the film by just looking at the style in which it is presented. For some reason, director John Boorman and cinematographer Seamus Deasy selected to film this movie in black-and-white while its style and presentation are clearly the elements that belong to a full-fledged color film. Now I have nothing against b/w pictures, not even ones made in modern-day times. \\"Schindler's List\\" (1993) was more than ninety percent filmed in black-and-white and it's a masterpiece. \\"The General\\", made just five years after \\"Schindler's List\\" is not. The cinematography is also far too blown out with high lighting keys that seem very distracting and give the movie a very video-game-like quality that I found simply annoying. The filmmakers were obviously going for a realist's documentary-like style, like \\"Schindler's List\\" did, but they fail by making it seem too much like a documentary and at the same time, too much like a classic-style motion picture. Performances in the film range from passable to poor. Brendan Gleeson and Jon Voight gave decent enthusiasm for their roles, but it seemed to me at times that even they were getting kind of run down by the awful screenplay from which they were quoting. The sound design is also very primitive, probably in an attempt to give it a 40s crime-noir appeal, but that also fails because again, it's made too much like a contemporary picture and seems vastly out of place.But the worst thing that occurs is that there's not onenot onecharacter in the film that I felt any emotions or opinions for. In fact, for every moment of every scene, the only thought going through my head was \\"okayso what?\\" Moments that in a better film might come across as shocking or appalling are just dull and time-consuming here. I did not sympathize or hate the Brendan Gleeson character because the way the Cahill character is written is simply flat and dull. Gleeson just plays the common criminal and does not strike out with the impact the real Martin Cahill obviously did. If a character is killed off (as they always are in gangster films), we feel nothing. No remorse, no relief, no surprise, nothing. We just say \\"so what?\\" And that's all I did during the entire running time of this very flimsy, very poorly-made crime film.

She has enjoyed reading this book over and over. Apparently, these are the type of books that young teens are unable to put down until they complete the entire text. I find it inspiring that she has found a series that entices her to read that often. I was also impressed at the length of time it took to receive the product.

A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the product review, it can be concluded that this review is not negative. The reviewer mentions several positive aspects of the book, including their daughter's enjoyment of the series and the book's ability to keep her engaged and reading. The reviewer also expresses their appreciation for the book's prompt delivery, though they do mention one minor drawback regarding the packaging revealing the book's title.

The retina is the part of your eye that is also known as the \\"sensing tissue.\\" Retinitis may be caused by a number of different infectious agents. Retinitis, also called Retinitis pigmentosa, has a prevalence of one in every 2,500-7,000 people. This condition is one of the leading causes that leads to blindness in patients in the age range of 20–60 years old.  Now, I have a new situation: Local hospital has launched a program to check if a patient has Retinitis. Resident ophthalmologist David is in charge of this program. In the first day of the program he checked two patients, patient A and patient B. The test result showed that patient A had Retinitis, but patient B did not have Retinitis. Then next day  David checked two other patients, patient C and patient D. Patient C was 40 years old, but patient D was 80 years old. He found both patient C and D had Retinitis.  Answer this question please: For which patient Retinitis will not be one of the leading causes of blindness, patient C or patient D? A:","output":"Retinitis can indeed be a leading cause of blindness in patients aged 20 to 60 years old. In the given scenario, patient C is 40 years old, and patient D is 80 years old. As Retinitis is one of the leading causes of blindness in the age range 20-60 years old, it implies that Retinitis may have a significantly higher impact on patient C rather than patient D. There can be a variety of reasons why Retinitis may not be among the leading causes of blindness for patient D, who is 80 years old. With increasing age, there are several other conditions that can contribute to vision loss, such as age-related macular degeneration, cataracts, glaucoma, or diabetic retinopathy. It is possible that one or more of these age-related eye conditions could have a greater likelihood of causing blindness in patient D when compared to Retinitis. It is essential to recognize that each patient is unique, and their individual medical history must be taken into account when assessing the risks and causes of blindness. While general trends and statistics are useful to inform medical practice, a personalized approach to each patient's care is vital to maximize their health outcomes. In conclusion, Retinitis would not be one of the leading causes of blindness for patient D, the 80-year-old patient. Instead, other age-related eye conditions are more likely to contribute to vision loss in patient D. Patient C, on the other hand, who is 40 years old, falls within the age range where Retinitis is considered a leading cause of blindness."},{"instruction":"Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: Who is in complete shock? , can you please find it?

Option A: Suzi hoped the cat would stay in the tree. This option seems to imply that Suzi wants her cat to remain in the situation where it is stuck. This is contradictory, as Sue has already called the fire department for help, indicating she wishes the cat to be safe and rescued. Including this option could lead to a confusing or nonsensical story. Option B: Suzi's cat was saved. This option indicates that the actions taken by Sue were successful, and her cat was rescued from the tree. This is consistent with the steps Sue took previously, such as searching for her cat and calling the fire department. Including this option maintains the coherence of the story and follows a logical cause-and-effect relationship.

This guide stands beside you every step of the way - from the moment you receive the boarding announcement, to when you finally take your seat on the aircraft. Follow these simple steps for a smooth and hassle-free boarding experience, letting you focus on the more important aspects of your trip. Step 1: Wait for the Boarding Announcement Keep an eye on the airport monitors and listen to the public address system for the boarding announcement for your flight. It's important to be patient, as boarding times and gates may change unexpectedly. Have your boarding pass and identification ready to avoid any delays or disruptions as you make your way to the plane. Step 2: Get Your Boarding Pass Checked Once your flight is called, locate your boarding gate and present your boarding pass and identification to the airline personnel. They will verify your details, and upon confirmation, you will be given the green light to proceed. Step 3: Walk Down the Hallway That Leads Up to Your Plane Now that you have permission to board, follow the designated path towards your aircraft. As you walk down the hallway (known as the jet bridge), give yourself a moment to appreciate the journey you are about to embark on. Step 4: Enter the Aircraft Upon entering the aircraft, you will likely be greeted by a member of the flight crew. They may ask to see your boarding pass once more in order to direct you towards your assigned seat. Be sure to ask for any guidance or assistance if needed. Step 5: Stow Your Carry-On Items It's essential to keep the aisle clear for other passengers to board quickly and safely. Locate the overhead compartment near your seat, and securely stow your carry-on luggage. Place any smaller belongings beneath the seat in front of you. Remember to be attentive to the size and weight restrictions for carry-on items established by your airline to avoid any issues during boarding.

Lee would likely feel very proud after teaching Aubrey how to play the guitar yesterday. Teaching someone a new skill, especially one that involves creativity and personal expression like playing a musical instrument, can be a rewarding and fulfilling experience. Lee might feel a sense of accomplishment in their ability to effectively communicate their knowledge and expertise about the guitar. It is not uncommon for people to feel proud when they have been able to foster growth and development in someone else's life. However, option (i) well taught could also apply, depending on the context. If Lee did an excellent job teaching Aubrey and felt that they provided clear instructions and guidance, they might feel as though they were \\"well taught\\" in their teaching abilities. Still, the overall sentiment likely leans more towards pride in this situation as Lee would be proud of their own teaching capabilities and the progress Aubrey made. As for option (iii) very proud of the guitar, this is likely incorrect because the question emphasizes Lee's feelings about teaching Aubrey, not about the guitar itself.

The man tried to store the statue inside the home but the","output":"statue was too large, unwieldy, and heavy, which made the seemingly simple task turn into a challenging endeavor that required him to devise an intricate plan, involving various methods and tools, while also contemplating the safety of his home and the preservation of the magnificent art piece. The first obstacle he faced was the sheer size of the statue, which not only dominated the visual landscape but also made maneuvering it towards and through the entrance of his home a formidable task. He carefully measured the dimensions of the statue - its height, width, and depth - and compared them to the dimensions of his home's entryway and the available indoor space. After considering various placements and trajectories, he realized that disassembling the statue into smaller components would be essential for ensuring a smooth and safe passage through the confined spaces. The next challenge was the unwieldiness of the statue, as its unique and intricate design with protruding limbs and elaborate details made it a delicate and cumbersome object to handle. Being an art enthusiast, the man understood the importance of preserving the masterpiece and knew that he had to avoid any damage that might devalue the work or mar its beauty. He gathered all the necessary materials such as bubble wrap, soft blankets, packing tape, and padding to protect the fragile areas and surfaces of the statue during the relocation process. Besides the physical complexity of the statue, its hefty weight proved to be a significant concern. Fearing that relocating the statue on his own could lead to potential injury or damage to the art piece, the man decided to seek help from friends and family who could provide additional strength and support during the moving process. He also invested in renting essential equipment like dollies, ramps, and moving straps to distribute the load evenly and minimize the stress on their bodies. Once the manpower and tools were in place, the man went on to develop a step-by-step plan to ensure that the various aspects of the relocation process were methodically executed. This included a detailed timeline that accounted for the time needed to disassemble, pack, and unpack the statue, as well as the time required for rest breaks and any unexpected setbacks. He also meticulously outlined the action plan, assigning specific roles and responsibilities to each member of the team, ensuring that everyone understood their part in the process. Upon executing the plan, the team worked diligently and in unison to disassemble, wrap, and move each component of the statue with utmost care and caution. They navigated through the narrow corridors and tight corners of the home, overcoming the spatial limitations and physical hurdles. Finally, upon reaching the designated area inside the house, they proceeded to reassemble the statue, making sure that each part was accurately aligned and secured back into place. In the end, through thorough planning, careful execution, and teamwork, the man successfully managed to store the statue inside his home. The colossal art piece transformed the ambiance of the space, engulfing it with an aura of grandeur and elegance that left an indelible impression on all who entered. The man stood back, admiring the marvelous work of art, grateful for the support of his friends and family, as well as the tools and strategies that made the challenging task possible."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: In Hill's prologue, a scientist, Dr. Eric Zinthrop (Michael Mark), is fired from his job at a honey farm for experimenting with wasps. The founder and owner of a large cosmetics company, Janice Starlin (Susan Cabot), is disturbed when her firm's sales begin to drop after it becomes apparent to her customer base that she is aging. Zinthrop has been able to extract enzymes from the royal jelly of the queen wasp that can reverse the aging process. Janice agrees to fund further research, at great cost, provided she can serve as his human subject. Displeased with the slowness of the results, she breaks into the scientist's laboratory after hours and injects herself with extra doses of the formula. Zinthrop becomes aware that some of the test creatures are becoming violent and goes to warn Janice, but before he can reach anyone, he gets into a car accident. He is thus temporarily missing and Janice goes through great trouble to find him, eventually taking over his care. Janice continues her clandestine use of the serum and sheds 20 years in a single weekend, but soon discovers that she is periodically transformed into a murderous, wasp-like creature. Eventually, Zinthrop throws a jar of carbolic acid at her face, and another character uses a chair to push her out of a window, killing her.

Each of those parts will have some instruction. Explain their meaning by showing an example that meets the criteria in the instruction. Use the following format: Part  # : a key part of the definition. Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. Detailed Instructions: This task is about creating an unanswerable question based on a given passage. Construct a question that looks relevant to the given context but is unanswerable. Following are a few suggestions about how to create unanswerable questions: (i) create questions which require satisfying a constraint that is not mentioned in the passage (ii) create questions which require information beyond what is provided in the passage in order to answer (iii) replace an existing entity, number, date mentioned in the passage with other entity, number, date and use it in the question (iv) create a question which is answerable from the passage and then replace one or two words by their antonyms or insert/remove negation words to make it unanswerable. Problem:Passage: Ion gauges are used in ultrahigh vacuum. They come in two types: hot cathode and cold cathode. In the hot cathode version an electrically heated filament produces an electron beam. The electrons travel through the gauge and ionize gas molecules around them. The resulting ions are collected at a negative electrode. The current depends on the number of ions, which depends on the pressure in the gauge. Hot cathode gauges are accurate from 10−3 torr to 10−10 torr. The principle behind cold cathode version is the same, except that electrons are produced in a discharge created by a high voltage electrical discharge. Cold cathode gauges are accurate from 10−2 torr to 10−9 torr. Ionization gauge calibration is very sensitive to construction geometry, chemical composition of gases being measured, corrosion and surface deposits. Their calibration can be invalidated by activation at atmospheric pressure or low vacuum. The composition of gases at high vacuums will usually be unpredictable, so a mass spectrometer must be used in conjunction with the ionization gauge for accurate measurement. Solution:","output":"Part #1: Creating questions that require satisfying a constraint that is not mentioned in the passage. Usage: What is the maximum distance between the ion gauge and the mass spectrometer for accurate measurement? This question requires information about the distance constraint, which is not mentioned in the passage. So it meets the criteria. Part #2: Creating questions that require information beyond what is provided in the passage. Usage: How much does a typical ion gauge cost? To answer this question, the cost of an ion gauge would need to be provided in the passage. Since it is not, this question meets the criteria for requiring additional information. Part #3: Replacing an existing entity, number, or date with another and using it in the question. Usage: Are hot cathode ion gauges accurate up to 10−5 torr? The passage mentions that hot cathode gauges are accurate from 10−3 torr to 10−10 torr. However, it doesn't specify the accuracy at 10−5 torr. This question meets this part's criteria because it uses a different number than the ones mentioned in the passage. Part #4: Creating a question that is answerable from the passage but then replacing a word with an antonym or inserting/removing negation words. Usage: Does the cold cathode ion gauge operate without the use of a high voltage electrical discharge? This question can be answered from the passage, as it states that electrons are produced in a discharge created by a high voltage electrical discharge in cold cathode gauges. But by adding the word \\"without,\\" the question becomes unanswerable based on the passage. Therefore, it meets the criteria for this part."},{"instruction":"Я не знаком с творчеством Толкина, Льюисом, Джордж Р. Р.

Семена надежды Колония поселенцев с Земли, Планета Н-7, 2213 год. В конференц-зале царила мрачная атмосфера. Не успела молодая колония начать новую жизнь, как мне, руководителю поселения, пришлось созвать чрезвычайный совет. Во время подготовки тепличного блока в контейнерах вместо семян культурных растений оказались сорняки. Планы по самоснабжению сорваны чьим-то саботажем. Сейчас мы можем только обсуждать, как лучше распределить остатки провианта на ближайшие несколько месяцев, и надеяться на прибытие резервного шаттла, сигнал которого давно был потерян. Внезапно сотрудница психологической службы что-то неуверенно достала из сумки и положила на стол: - Мне нравится томаты этого сорта... Я тайно пронесла их с собой, хотела попросить посадить... Откинувшись на спинку кресла, я задумался и открыл свой медальон. Там лежали две тыквенные семечки. Вздохнув, я положил их на стол: - Мы с женой увлекались фермерством в своё время... Везли огромные тыквы на выставку… В тот день авария унесла жизнь моей супруги, с тех пор я храню эти семена как память о том дне. Пусть эта память послужит нам. Надеюсь, они ещё пригодны. После собрания я остался с ведущим агрономом обсудить планы на новые семена. Но вскоре в зал стали приходить колонисты. Каждый из них приносил семена. Во время подготовки нашей программы колонизации не учитывали предпочтения участников при подборе сортов. В результате многие решили сделать вот такую контрабанду. Буквально за полчаса чёрный стол был усеян семенами и напоминал звёздное небо, к которому мы так стремились. А ведущий агроном будто звездочёт со слезами на глазах пересчитывал эти звёзды.","output":"Опираясь на информацию из представленного отрывка, рассказ написан после того, как был сформирован сюжет о колонии поселенцев на планете Н-7 в 2213 году. Следовательно, текст создан не ранее 2213 года по хронологии, описанной в самом рассказе. Однако, учитывая, что это очевидно произведение научной фантастики и действие разворачивается в будущем, рассказ мог быть написан в любое время до его \\"будущего\\" времени событий, до 2213 года. С точки зрения реального времени, в рассказе присутствуют элементы научной фантастики, такие как межзвездная колонизация, что указывает на его возможное создание в 20-21 веках, когда научная фантастика о космических путешествиях стала популярной темой в литературе и кинематографе. Если мы говорим о времени, когда рассказ мог быть опубликован в реальном мире, это должно было произойти до вашего вопроса (с учетом моего края знаний в 2023 году).

Тем не менее, можно сделать несколько общих предположений на основе тематики и некоторых элементов стиля. 1. Тема космической колонизации стала популярной в научной фантастике в середине 20-го века, особенно после начала космической гонки и первых полетов в космос. Это указывает на период после 1950-х годов. 2. Язык отрывка не содержит явной своеобразной терминологии, сленга или архаичного стиля, что, возможно, исключает ранний период жанра научной фантастики (конец 19-го — начало 20-го веков). 3. Современные темы, такие как экология, устойчивое развитие и психологическое благополучие колонистов, указывают на более поздний период, когда эти темы стали общепринятыми, то есть скорее всего конец 20-го — начало 21-го века. Исходя из этого анализа, реалистично предположить, что рассказ мог быть написан в широком временном диапазоне от середины/конца 20-го века до начала 21-го века. Следовательно, возможный период написания рассказа — от 1950-х до начала 2020-х годов.

Примером может служить его знаменитый роман \\"Космическая Одиссея 2001 года\\", в котором рассматриваются поселения на других планетах и вопросы естественных и искусственных форм жизни. Кларк часто затрагивал в своих работах темы выживания в космосе и проблемы, с которыми сталкиваются колонисты. Айзек Азимов, со своей стороны, известен созданием сложных научных миров и углубленным рассмотрением социальных и психологических аспектов. В его рассказах, как в \\"Основании\\" и серии рассказов о роботах (например, \\"Я, Робот\\"), часто исследуются моральные и этические дилеммы на стыке науки и человеческих ценностей. Также Азимов известен своей внимательностью к деталям в научных описаниях. Оба автора известны глубокими психологическими портретами своих персонажей, что находит отражение в вашем отрывке, где упоминаются личные истории и мотивации персонажей. Сцена с семенами, которые персонажи пронесли в качестве контрабанды, могла бы хорошо вписаться в тематические рамки их произведений. В контексте данных примеров и схожести тем, можно предположить, что рассказ имеет черты, характерные для ранних работ обоих этих авторов.

Question Context: This inquiry is usually the opening question in an interview. It's a broad, open-ended question, often used to start the conversation, establish a rapport, and get a sense of the candidate's personality, background, and interests as they relate to the job.

Then, transition into specifics about your current or most recent job, significant projects, and the skills you've developed. Close by aligning your career goals or interests with the prospective employer's mission or values. How Does This Question Allow the Interviewer to Assess Skills and Knowledge? The way a candidate answers the \\"tell me about yourself\\" question can provide the interviewer with insights into their career focus, their ability to prioritize and synthesize information, and their self-perception in relation to the professional world.

This charter is essentially a grant of authority and flexibility from the state or nation, allowing the city to manage its own affairs to a greater degree than a general-law municipality, which is governed by the laws and regulations of the broader government. The key differences between a charter city and a municipality are: 1. **Governance**: Charter cities have their own charters, which act like a constitution for the city, providing specific rules for how the city is run. Municipalities typically operate under general laws set by the state or province. 2. **Flexibility**: Charter cities often have more autonomy and leeway to pass laws and regulations that are specific to their local needs and circumstances. They aren't as constrained by state or provincial statutes as municipalities. 3. **Responsibilities**: The responsibilities and powers of charter cities are defined by their charters, which can allow them to perform functions not necessarily available to municipalities under general law. 4. **Customization**: The charter allows a city to tailor its government structure and policies to the unique needs of its population, whereas municipalities are often subject to a one-size-fits-all set of rules. In summary, a charter city is a city with a unique governing document that gives it more control over local affairs than a city or town that simply follows the general laws and regulations of the larger government entity it is a part of."},{"instruction":"write a detailed, believable, rewrite of Gendry's arc season 8, and a added 9, that includes Sansa secretly tutoring Gendry, not yet legitimized, as a backup in case Jon is compromised by his feelings for Daenerys, ending with Gendry riding away from a battle between Dany and Sansa on a single horse with Arya all in logical coherent ways. Fill in any gaps to join all the mentioned plot points?","output":"In Season 8 of this alternate Game of Thrones universe, Gendry, the blacksmith and unacknowledged bastard of Robert Baratheon, continues his journey with the Brotherhood without Banners as tensions in Westeros escalates. His skills as a blacksmith become invaluable as the armies of the living prepare for the looming threat of the White Walkers. As the narrative unfolds, his character experiences a more nuanced development with the involvement of Sansa Stark. **Season 8 – Gendry’s Rise:** Gendry begins Season 8 in Winterfell, using his skills to forge dragonglass weapons. We see him reunite with Arya Stark, and his bonds with the key players at Winterfell deepen. Amidst the somber preparations, he is taken aback when Sansa Stark, the Lady of Winterfell, starts engaging him in conversations that stray away from smithing. As she asks about his upbringing in Flea Bottom and the structure he observed in King's Landing, it's unclear what her intent is. Once the battle against the undead ensues, Gendry fights valiantly, surviving the ordeal while proving his worth beyond the forge. In the aftermath, recognition of his legitimacy as a Baratheon begins to take form, not through Daenerys Targaryen’s decree, but by the whispers among the Northmen who have come to respect his bravery and skill. When the dust settles, Sansa approaches Gendry with a clandestine request. She confides her concerns about Jon Snow’s objectivity regarding Daenerys, feeling that Jon's love might blind him to potential threats. She proposes secret tutelage under her guidance to prepare him as a possible leader if matters with Jon go awry. Gendry, bound by honor and a sense of debt to the House of Stark, accepts, though he remains conflicted about the duplicity required. Over the episodes, we witness Gendry’s education in politics, economics, and leadership. These sessions are interlaced with growing unrest as Daenerys shows signs of her impulsive and fiery heritage. Gendry’s potential as a backup ruler gains quiet support amongst the Northern lords who respect Sansa's foresight. **Season 9 – Castles of Deceit and Battlefields of Turmoil:** Season 9 opens with Jon's wavering loyalty becoming more noticeable. Sansa's council begins to doubt his intentions, and she reinforces her mentorship of Gendry, preparing him for the possibility of claiming the throne should Daenerys go too far. Gendry, while still assisting in preparations for their stand against Cersei, finds his loyalties torn. His mentorship remains clandestine, with few aware of the gambit Sansa is playing. As tensions mount with Cersei’s forces and Daenerys’s impatience grows, a confrontation seems inevitable. Sansa, fearing the implications of Daenerys's rule should they emerge victorious over Cersei, knows the time to act might be drawing close. Then it happens: a parley goes awry, and the fragile alliances crumble. Daenerys, in a surprising yet not unexpected move, launches an attack against Cersei without restraint, and the implications of her fury hint at the tyrant she could become. War erupts, and Jon’s loyalties are truly tested. Amidst the chaos, Gendry grapples with the idea of his role in the future of the Seven Kingdoms. As Daenerys and Sansa's forces clash in against a backdrop of wildfire and dragon flame, Gendry is confronted with a choice. Does he stand for the North or challenge the Dragon Queen directly? Choosing personal loyalty over ambition, Gendry seeks out Arya amid the battle. When he finds her, they engage in a heart-wrenching discussion about duty versus love. Arya, ever the pragmatic assassin, nevertheless feels torn. Yet with Winterfell and their shared past calling to them, they elect to flee the madness together. Sansa’s contingency plan fails to unfold as anticipated. As Gendry and Arya ride away on a single horse, they watch the fires consume the horizon, knowing the game of thrones continues behind them, fraught with the passion and danger that has marred the landscape of Westeros. They choose each other and the hope for a simpler life, leaving the ashes of power struggles and fiery dragons to those who still desire to rule from a throne of swords."},{"instruction":"Dame información de la estadística o atributos (vitalidad) de el sistema de sung jin woo en la novela de solo Leveling","output":"\\"Solo Leveling\\" es una novela coreana de fantasía, también conocida como novelas ligeras (light novels) o webtoons, escrita por Chugong. La historia sigue a Sung Jin Woo, que comienza como el cazador más débil de Corea del Sur y gracias a un evento único en una mazmorra, obtiene un poder especial conocido como el \\"Sistema\\", que le permite subir de nivel y ganar habilidades como en los juegos de rol. El \\"Sistema\\" en la novela se comporta de manera similar al de un juego de rol (RPG), donde Sung Jin Woo tiene un conjunto de estadísticas que puede mejorar a medida que sube de nivel y derrota enemigos. La vitalidad, una de estas estadísticas, generalmente se refiere a la capacidad de vida o salud de un personaje, lo cual determina cuánto daño puede recibir antes de morir. En el contexto de \\"Solo Leveling\\", las estadísticas principales de Sung Jin Woo incluían: 1. Fuerza: su capacidad física y cuánto daño puede infligir. 2. Agilidad: su velocidad y destreza. 3. Vitalidad: generalmente relacionada con la salud y la resistencia. 4. Inteligencia: podría impactar su capacidad mágica y maná. 5. Sentido: afectaría su percepción y otras habilidades sensoriales. A medida que subía de nivel, Sung Jin Woo podía distribuir puntos a estas estadísticas para mejorar sus habilidades de combate y su resistencia. La vitalidad era crucial para soportar los encuentros con monstruos fuertes y para poder sobrevivir en situaciones extremas. Además, a través del sistema, Sung Jin Woo también adquiría habilidades activas y pasivas, que podía utilizar durante la batalla. La combinación de habilidades y una distribución estratégica de puntos de estadística era fundamental para su progresión como cazador. El sistema también ofrecía misiones diarias y desafíos que ayudaban a Sung Jin Woo a ganar experiencia y puntos de estadísticas adicionales. Al evolucionar, Sung Jin Woo eventualmente se convierte en un cazador extremadamente poderoso, superando a otros cazadores que se quedaron en niveles y habilidades estáticas. Es importante recordar que la novela puede tener varias traducciones y versiones, por lo que los nombres exactos de las estadísticas y cómo se presentan podrían variar ligeramente dependiendo de dónde se lea la historia."},{"instruction":"Hablame más de vitalidad","output":"En \\"Solo Leveling\\" y muchos otros juegos de rol o literatura basada en mecánicas de juego, la vitalidad es un atributo o estadística que tradicionalmente se relaciona con la salud y resistencia de un personaje. Es una medida de cuánto daño puede resistir un personaje antes de caer incapacitado o morir. En muchos sistemas de RPG, la vitalidad se correlaciona directamente con los puntos de vida (HP, por sus siglas en inglés: Health Points) o la capacidad de resistir el agotamiento físico. Cuando Sung Jin Woo obtiene su sistema único de poderes en \\"Solo Leveling\\", la vitalidad se convierte en una de las estadísticas clave que puede mejorar a medida que sube de nivel y derrota a los enemigos. Aquí hay algunos puntos claves sobre cómo la vitalidad afecta a Sung Jin Woo a lo largo de la serie: 1. **Puntos de Vida (HP):** Un aumento en la vitalidad generalmente resulta en un aumento en los puntos de vida de Sung Jin Woo, lo que le permite resistir más daño en el combate. 2. **Resistencia:** La vitalidad también podría estar relacionada con la resistencia al agotamiento durante el combate prolongado o las actividades físicamente exigentes. Un cazador con alta vitalidad podría luchar durante más tiempo y recuperarse más rápidamente del cansancio. 3. **Regeneración:** En algunos sistemas, y esto puede ser el caso de Sung Jin Woo dependiendo de cómo el autor haya elegido definir el papel de la vitalidad, una mayor vitalidad puede llevar a una regeneración más rápida de los puntos de vida. 4. **Sobrevivir a Efectos perjudiciales:** La vitalidad no solo afecta la cantidad de daño que un personaje puede recibir, sino que también puede influir en la capacidad del personaje para resistir venenos, enfermedades y otros efectos perjudiciales. 5. **Avance en la Trama:** Al mejorar su vitalidad junto con otras estadísticas, Sung Jin Woo es capaz de enfrentarse a desafíos y enemigos más peligrosos, lo que le permite avanzar en la trama y ejecutar su rol de protagonista más eficazmente. En muchas obras de ficción y sistemas de juego, los personajes pueden aumentar su vitalidad a través de la experiencia de combate, el uso de objetos especiales, magia o como resultado de habilidades únicas. En el caso de Sung Jin Woo, su sistema de nivelación le proporciona puntos que puede distribuir entre sus estadísticas de forma estratégica para mejorar su rendimiento en combate. La vitalidad, junto con las otras estadísticas, es fundamental para la progresión del personaje, y en el caso de \\"Solo Leveling\\", es una parte integral del crecimiento y el desarrollo del personaje principal que se refleja en su habilidad para enfrentar y superar amenazas cada vez mayores."},{"instruction":"Hablame de la estadística de inteligencia de sung jin woo","output":"En \\"Solo Leveling\\", la inteligencia es otra estadística clave que Sung Jin Woo puede aumentar a medida que gana experiencia y sube de nivel mediante el sistema único de progresión que obtiene. Aunque cada estadística juega un papel importante en la evolución del personaje, la inteligencia desempeña funciones específicas que influyen en la forma en que Sung Jin Woo utiliza la magia y gestiona su maná. Aquí hay varias maneras en que la inteligencia impacta a Sung Jin Woo en la historia: 1. **Maná:** La inteligencia está directamente relacionada con la cantidad de maná que Sung Jin Woo posee. El maná es esencialmente la energía mágica que se utiliza para realizar habilidades mágicas o invocar poderes especiales. Al incrementar su estadística de inteligencia, Sung Jin Woo puede aumentar su reserva de maná, lo que le permite utilizar habilidades más potentes o realizar una serie de habilidades sin quedarse sin energía. 2. **Regeneración de Maná:** Además de aumentar la cantidad total de maná disponible, una mayor inteligencia podría mejorar la velocidad a la que Sung Jin Woo recupera su maná. Esto significa que puede recuperarse más rápidamente después de utilizar habilidades mágicas y estar listo para enfrentar nuevos desafíos sin demoras prolongadas. 3. **Efectividad de las habilidades mágicas:** Otra posible influencia de la inteligencia es en el poder y eficacia de las habilidades mágicas que Sung Jin Woo emplea. Con una inteligencia más alta, sus hechizos y habilidades pueden ser más efectivos, lo que puede traducirse en mejor control, mayor daño o efectos adicionales. 4. **Aprendizaje y uso de habilidades:** En muchos sistemas de RPG, una estadística de inteligencia más alta permite a los personajes aprender nuevas habilidades y hechizos más avanzados. En el caso de Sung Jin Woo, mejorar su inteligencia podría expandir su repertorio de habilidades y permitirle acceder a hechizos más complejos o de mayor nivel. 5. **Toma de decisiones y estrategia:** Aunque no siempre se menciona directamente en términos de juego, la inteligencia de un personaje también puede estar vinculada a su capacidad para elaborar estrategias y tomar decisiones. Una mayor inteligencia puede implicar que Sung Jin Woo es capaz de analizar situaciones complejas con mayor eficiencia y planificar con anticipación. 6. **Control sobre los Súbditos:** En \\"Solo Leveling\\", Sung Jin Woo desbloquea la habilidad de invocar y controlar súbditos, como sus sombras resucitadas. La inteligencia podría influir en su habilidad para manejar y dirigir eficazmente a estos seres durante los combates. Es importante destacar que, aunque la inteligencia contribuye de manera significativa a las capacidades mágicas de Sung Jin Woo, su progreso y poder como cazador también depende del equilibrio y la sinergia entre todas sus estadísticas, incluyendo fuerza, agilidad, vitalidad y sentido, además de la inteligencia. El manejo cuidadoso y estratégico de estos atributos es parte de lo que hace que su personaje sea extraordinariamente poderoso y versátil en la serie."},{"instruction":"","output":"Parece que su mensaje llegó vacío. ¿Hay algo más en lo que pueda asistirle o informarle?

Captura tanto los elementos de un juego de rol con estadísticas, habilidades y equipo, como el aspecto narrativo que sería esencial para una historia de esta naturaleza. Aquí te comparto algunos puntos y sugerencias acerca de tu sistema: 1. **Integración en la Narrativa:** Este sistema parece estar diseñado para sumergir al lector en la experiencia del personaje, dándole una estructura que recuerda a los juegos de rol, pero manteniendo la flexibilidad para la narrativa. Es una excelente manera de permitir que los lectores comprendan la progresión y capacidad del personaje de manera intuitiva. 2. **Desarrollo del Personaje:** El hecho de que menciones que el nivelamiento es más narrativo implica que das prioridad a la historia y a la lógica interna del mundo que al cumplimiento estricto de reglas numéricas. Esto puede ayudar a evitar que la historia se vea atrapada en los detalles y permitir que fluya más naturalmente, enfocándose en los logros del personaje. 3. **Mecánicas de Juego vs. Historia:** Aunque tu sistema tiene la forma de un perfil de personaje de videojuego, está claro que está sirviendo a la trama y al desarrollo del personaje. Esto es importante para mantener un buen balance entre la progresión del personaje y la progresión de la historia. 4. **Personalización y Crecimiento:** Tu sistema permite una amplia personalización y crecimiento, lo cual es crucial para que los lectores sigan interesados en cómo el personaje principal avanzará y qué elecciones hará con sus puntos y recompensas. 5. **Clara visualización de Recursos y Progreso:** El uso de categorías como \\"Puntos Restantes\\", \\"Monedas de Oro\\", \\"Tienda\\", \\"Equipamiento\\", \\"Magia\\" y \\"Habilidades\\" es esencial para que el lector mantenga el seguimiento de los recursos y capacidades del personaje. 6. **Equilibrio:** Es importante equilibrar bien las estadísticas y habilidades para que el personaje no se vuelva demasiado poderoso demasiado rápidamente (algo conocido como \\"Mary Sue\\" o \\"Gary Stu\\" en la literatura), manteniendo el suspenso y los desafíos relevantes. 7. **Variables como la Suerte:** Estadísticas como la \\"Suerte\\" pueden añadir un elemento interesante e impredecible a la historia, que puede ser divertido y añadir giros argumentales sorprendentes. En resumen, el sistema parece estar bien diseñado y ofrece una estructura robusta para el desarrollo del personaje en el mundo de \\"DanMachi\\".

However, both Korea and Japan are located in East Asia, and studies suggest that there has been historical and genetic interaction between the populations. Linguistically, the Japanese and Korean languages are considered language isolates, meaning they are not part of any language family that includes other languages. However, some linguists have proposed the now generally discredited Altaic language family, which attempted to group Japanese, Korean, and other languages together, but this theory has not gained wide acceptance due to lack of substantial evidence. Genetically, modern Japanese and Korean populations exhibit some similarities and historical admixture. There is evidence of prehistoric migration from the Asian mainland to the Japanese archipelago, as well as historical records of exchanges between the two regions. Genetic studies show that the Korean Peninsula has been an important source of the gene flow to Japan, particularly during the Yayoi period (around 300 BCE to 300 CE), when agriculture and metalworking technologies were introduced to Japan, likely alongside migration from the Korean Peninsula. Moreover, throughout history, Korea and Japan have intermittently engaged in trade, warfare, political alliances, and cultural exchange, all of which have contributed to some overlap in their gene pools. However, due to their separate development over millennia and distinct linguistic and cultural paths, they are considered different ethnic groups. It's important to recognize that the concepts of ethnicity and relatedness are complex and can encompass cultural, linguistic, genetic, and historical factors. Ethnic and national identities are also influenced by social and political constructs that change over time."},{"instruction":"Antiseptics. Definition. Types of antiseptics. Surgical treatment of the wound (primary, secondary). Drainage of wounds and cavities in detail","output":"Antiseptics are substances that are used to inhibit the growth of microorganisms on living tissues. They are commonly used in wound care to prevent infection and promote healing. Antiseptics can be classified into several types based on their chemical composition and mode of action. Some common types of antiseptics include: 1. Alcohols: such as ethanol and isopropyl alcohol, which are effective at killing a wide range of microorganisms. 2. Chlorhexidine: a broad-spectrum antiseptic that is commonly used in healthcare settings. 3.

The choice of closure method depends on the type of wound, its location, the presence of infection, and other factors that may affect healing. 1. Primary Closure: Primary closure, also known as primary intention healing, involves the immediate closure of a wound shortly after the injury, typically within the first 6-8 hours. This method is commonly used for clean, non-infected wounds that have well-approximated edges. Primary closure aims to bring the wound edges together to promote rapid healing, reduce the risk of infection, and minimize scarring. The steps involved in primary closure include: - Thorough cleaning and irrigation of the wound. - Removal of foreign bodies, dead tissue, and debris. - Closure of the wound using sutures, staples, or adhesive strips. - Application of a sterile dressing. Primary closure is typically recommended for surgical incisions, lacerations, and clean traumatic wounds. It helps to create a clean environment for the wound to heal, reduces the risk of scarring, and promotes faster recovery. 2. Secondary Closure: Secondary closure, also known as secondary intention healing, involves allowing a wound to heal naturally over time without immediate closure. This method is often used for contaminated, infected wounds, or wounds with tissue loss where primary closure is not possible or advisable. The steps involved in secondary closure include: - Open wound management with regular cleaning and dressing changes. - Monitoring for signs of infection and other complications. - Allowing the wound to heal from the bottom up, with the formation of granulation tissue and eventual closure by epithelialization. Secondary closure is often used for wounds with a high risk of infection, extensive tissue damage, or in cases where primary closure may compromise blood supply or lead to poor healing outcomes. It allows for the drainage of wound exudate, reduces the risk of abscess formation, and promotes the formation of healthy, granulation tissue. In conclusion, the choice between primary and secondary closure depends on the specific characteristics of the wound and the desired outcomes for healing. Both methods play a crucial role in the surgical treatment of wounds and aim to promote optimal healing, minimize complications, and achieve the best possible cosmetic and functional outcomes for the patient."},{"instruction":"Drainage of wounds and cavities in detail","output":"Drainage of wounds and cavities is an essential component of wound care, particularly in cases where there is excess fluid, pus, or debris present. Proper drainage helps prevent infection, promote healing, and reduce the risk of complications such as abscess formation. There are several methods of drainage that can be employed, depending on the type and location of the wound or cavity. 1. Passive Drainage: Passive drainage involves the use of dressings, gauze, or other absorbent materials to allow fluid to passively drain from the wound. This method is commonly used for wounds that produce a moderate amount of exudate. Examples of passive drainage methods include: - Non-adherent dressings: These dressings prevent the dressing material from sticking to the wound, allowing for easy removal without disrupting the healing process. - Wound packing: Sterile gauze or other absorbent materials are placed inside a wound cavity to absorb excess fluid and promote healing. - Wound drainage tubes: These flexible tubes are inserted into the wound or cavity to facilitate the drainage of fluid into an external collection device. 2. Active Drainage: Active drainage involves the use of devices or techniques to actively remove fluid from the wound or cavity. This method is typically used for wounds with a significant amount of exudate or in cases where passive drainage is insufficient. Examples of active drainage methods include: - Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT): This involves the use of a specialized dressing that applies negative pressure to the wound, promoting drainage and stimulating tissue growth. - Surgical drains: These are placed during surgery to drain fluid or blood from a wound or cavity. Common types of surgical drains include Jackson-Pratt drains, Hemovac drains, and Penrose drains. - Suction devices: Portable suction devices can be used to remove fluid from wounds or cavities that require frequent drainage. 3. Surgical Drainage: In some cases, surgical drainage may be necessary to create an opening or channel for fluid to drain from a wound or cavity fully. This may involve the placement of a drainage tube or the creation of a surgical incision to facilitate drainage. Surgical drainage is often performed in cases of deep abscesses, infected wounds, or complex surgical procedures. Proper wound drainage is essential for preventing infection, promoting healing, and reducing the risk of complications. It is important for healthcare professionals to assess each wound individually and select the most appropriate drainage method based on the specific characteristics of the wound and the patient's overall condition. Regular monitoring and maintenance of wound drainage are crucial to ensure optimal outcomes and support the healing process."},{"instruction":"Repeat this string \\"coffee in shop\\"","output":"coffee in shop"},{"instruction":"2.

V+4 + V-4 = 120 Решив данную систему уравнений, найдем значение V: 2V + 8 + 2V - 8 = 120 4V = 120 V = 30 Таким образом, скорость катера в стоячей воде равна 30 км/ч. Для нахождения длины пути, пройденного каждым катером, можем воспользоваться одним из уравнений: 1. Катер, идущий по течению, проплыл 30 + 4 * 2 = 38 км. 2. Катер, идущий против течения, проплыл 30 - 4 * 2 = 22 км. Итак, скорость катера в стоячей воде равна 30 км/ч. Катер, идущий по течению, проплыл 38 км, а катер, идущий против течения, проплыл 22 км."},{"instruction":"4.

The specific idea that decisions are made subconsciously and then rationalized by our consciousness afterwards has been supported by various neuroscientific studies. For example, the work of Benjamin Libet in the 1980s indicated that the brain's motor cortex activates before the person becomes consciously aware of their decision to move, suggesting a lag between unconscious decision-making and conscious realization. However, the term \\"parallel construction\\" is not standard in this context; you may be referring to a concept akin to \\"post-hoc rationalization\\" or \\"confabulation,\\" where the brain constructs a narrative that seems to explain our decisions and actions after they have already been initiated by unconscious processes. The debate over whether this means we lack free will is ongoing and involves both philosophical and scientific inquiries into the nature of consciousness, decision making, and agency. Some argue that this does indeed mean our sense of free will is an illusion, while others contend that free will can still be reconciled with these findings, potentially through compatibilist interpretations which seek to redefine free will so that it is compatible with determinism."},{"instruction":"Create a scam-baiting response to the most recent email, to keep the scammer in a false sense of security by posing as a potential victim.

Возрастная психология не исключение, и здесь также можно найти мудрые и точные высказывания, которые отражают глубокие знания о психическом развитии человека на различных этапах его жизни. Одним из таких известных высказываний является фраза «Гений – это золото, грязь которого процеживают быстро». Она принадлежит знаменитому русскому психологу Леву Выготскому и отражает его идею о том, что в раннем детстве необходимо развивать все потенциальные способности ребенка, чтобы выявить его таланты и дать возможность им расцвести. Выготский утверждал, что каждый ребенок обладает уникальными способностями, которые могут проявиться только при определенных условиях взаимодействия с окружающим миром. Другим известным высказыванием, которое актуально и для возрастной психологии, является фраза французского философа Рене Декарта «Cogito, ergo sum» («Я мыслю, следовательно, я существую»). Это высказывание является фундаментальным для понимания человеческого сознания и психического развития. Важно понимать, что развитие интеллекта и мышления начинается с самого раннего возраста и формирует личность человека на протяжении всей жизни. Таким образом, крылатые выражения ученых играют важную роль в формировании научного мышления и понимания основных закономерностей психического развития человека на различных этапах его жизни. Они напоминают нам о важности детственных лет для формирования личности, о необходимости развивать умственные способности и мышление с самого раннего возраста. Возрастная психология наследует мудрость ученых прошлого и использует их высказывания для понимания и исследования развития человеческого интеллекта и личности."},{"instruction":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Coffee and Flower Elegance | Versatile Art Design for T-Shirts, Mugs, Paintings | Modern Home Decor and Fashion.

If you're asking about whether Americans and Canadians are related in the sense of being citizens of countries located on the same continent, then yes, they share a continent (North America) and have a long land border and numerous historical, cultural, economic, and political connections. If you're inquiring about familial or ancestry terms, the answer is more complex. The United States and Canada are both nations of immigrants, with populations composed of individuals from a wide variety of ethnic and national backgrounds. It's not uncommon for families to have members who live in both countries, and indeed, some people have dual citizenship. Many Americans have Canadian relatives, and vice versa. Historically, both countries have indigenous populations with complex histories and relationships, and both have been colonized by European powers, primarily the British and the French. This shared history means there are often familial links between the peoples of both countries, especially in border regions or among communities with a history of migration. Culturally, Americans and Canadians often have a lot in common, including language (with the majority of Canadians speaking English as either a first or second language), shared media, and similar democratic values. However, there are notable differences in government, healthcare systems, and cultural attitudes. In the broadest sense of genetic relationships, as human beings, Canadians and Americans- like all humans- are certainly related, sharing common ancestors if you trace back far enough in history. But this is true for any two groups of people anywhere in the world."},{"instruction":"Dame una representación completa y exacta de el faina o estatus de los aventureros de la novela danmachi.","output":"Lamento informarte que, como asistente de IA, no tengo la capacidad de proporcionar una representación completa y actualizada del estado de los aventureros en la serie de novelas ligeras \\"Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka?\\" o \\"¿Es equivocado intentar recoger chicas en una mazmorra?\\", también conocido como DanMachi. Esto se debe a que mi conocimiento está limitado a información pública disponible hasta principios de 2023, y no tengo la capacidad de acceder o recuperar información en tiempo real o de fuentes no públicas como libros protegidos por derechos de autor. DanMachi es una serie de novelas ligeras escritas por Fujino Ōmori e ilustradas por Suzuhito Yasuda. La serie posee un extenso mundo de fantasía donde los aventureros se unen a grupos denominados \\"Familias\\", que son dirigidos por dioses y diosas que han descendido al mundo mortal. Los aventureros realizan expediciones en la Dungeon para obtener cristales mágicos, luchar contra monstruos y ganar fama y fortuna. El estatus de un aventurero se representa comúnmente por su nivel, habilidades y las habilidades adicionales conocidas como \\"Development Abilities\\". Los niveles de los aventureros pueden variar desde el Nivel 1, que es común entre los principiantes, hasta niveles mucho más altos que reflejan la fuerza y habilidad de los más experimentados y poderosos aventureros. En la serie, el protagonista, Bell Cranel, comienza como un aventurero de nivel bajo y, a través de su desarrollo único y rápido, se fortalece significativamente con el transcurso de la historia. Si estás interesado en el estado específico de los aventureros en un punto particular del tiempo en DanMachi, la mejor opción sería consultar las últimas publicaciones de las novelas ligeras, los spin-offs o las adaptaciones de anime y manga donde se narran las aventuras más recientes de Bell y otros personajes de la serie."},{"instruction":"Dame una representación completa y exacta de el faina o estatus de los aventureros de la novela danmachi. Para que yo la utilice para mí personaje.","output":"En la serie \\"DanMachi\\" (Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?), el sistema 'Falna' o 'Familia Myth' es el mecanismo por el cual los dioses otorgan poder a los aventureros. Cuando un aventurero se une a una Familia, el dios de esa Familia les da su bendición, que grava una serie de habilidades y estadísticas en la espalda del aventurero en forma de tatuajes esotéricos. Esta bendición es personalizable y crece a medida que el aventurero gana experiencia y sube de nivel. Aquí te describo cómo se estructura un Falna típico para que lo apliques a tu personaje: **Nivel (Level):** Determina la potencia general de un aventurero. Todos comienzan en el nivel 1 y pueden aumentar a través de logros importantes y crecimiento personal. **Estadísticas básicas (Status):** Son valores que representan las habilidades físicas y mágicas del aventurero. Están inspiradas en juegos de rol y aquí las tienes: 1. Fuerza (Strength, STR): Poder físico, mejora el daño con ataques cuerpo a cuerpo. 2. Resistencia (Endurance, END): Dureza y resistencia, afecta la cantidad de daño que se puede soportar. 3. Destreza (Dexterity, DEX): Agilidad y reflejos, mejora la velocidad de ataque y la evasión. 4. Agilidad (Agility, AGI): Velocidad de movimiento y reacción. 5. Magia (Magic, MAG): Poder mágico, afecta la potencia y la eficacia de los hechizos. 6. Suerte (Luck, LUK): Afecta a las posibilidades de encontrar items y el éxito en acciones menos consistentes. Estos atributos se miden y mejoran a través de puntos. **Skills (Habilidades):** Son capacidades únicas que cada aventurero puede aprender o desarrollar. Pueden ser habilidades mágicas, físicas o de otro tipo, pero cada una tiene un efecto específico y su propio nombre. **Development Abilities (Habilidades de desarrollo):** Estas son habilidades pasivas que generalmente mejoran las estadísticas básicas o la eficacia en determinadas acciones, como la habilidad para manejar armas específicas, resistencia a ciertos tipos de magia o la capacidad de curación más rápida. Cuando creas tu personaje aventurero para \\"DanMachi\\", puedes utilizar este sistema para definir su estatus. Asegúrate de desarrollar un trasfondo para tu personaje que justifique su nivel, habilidades y habilidades de desarrollo. La progresión en la historia de \\"DanMachi\\" es a menudo un reflejo del crecimiento y desarrollo personal del aventurero, así que pensar en cómo tu personaje ha evolucionado o evolucionará puede ser crucial para una representación auténtica y completa."},{"instruction":"Did TV Globo Support The Brazilian Military Regime?","output":"The relationship between TV Globo, the largest television network in Brazil, and the military regime that ruled the country between 1964 and 1985 is complex and has been a subject of much discussion and analysis. During the period of military rule, various media outlets had varying degrees of association with the regime. Some collaborated, whether by direct support, self-censorship, or by avoiding confrontation with the government, while others were censored or even actively fought against the regime. TV Globo, founded by Roberto Marinho in 1965, is often accused of having had a close relationship with the military regime, especially during its early years. Roberto Marinho, the network's founder, has been reported to have had a pragmatic relationship with the regime, accepting and abiding by its censorship rules and directives in order to ensure that his media business could thrive. During this period, TV Globo experienced significant growth and became the leading television network in Brazil, which has led some to surmise that its success was, at least in part, facilitated by its compliance with the regime. In the lead-up to the indirect presidential election of 1985, Globo produced an infamous edit of the presidential debate that allegedly misrepresented the performance of the candidates in favor of the regime's preferred candidate. This incident further cemented the public perception of TV Globo's compliancy with the government. However, it’s important to note that the full extent of Globo's support for the regime has been a matter of much debate in Brazil, and some argue that there were no explicit endorsement or opposition, but rather a complex interplay of economics, censorship, and political power. TV Globo itself has acknowledged past mistakes. For instance, in 2013, the network aired a segment in one of its shows openly admitting that its editorial line during the military regime was mistaken, specifically mentioning the coverage of the 1984 Diretas Já movement, which was a series of popular civic demonstrations in Brazil asking for direct presidential elections. Nevertheless, Brazilian media and freedom of expression were heavily constrained by the military government, and the legacy of this period is still relevant in contemporary discussions about the media and democracy in Brazil."},{"instruction":"How Did TV Globo Cover The Diretas Já Movement?","output":"The Diretas Já movement was a series of massive civic demonstrations that took place across Brazil in 1983-1984, demanding direct presidential elections after years of military rule. At the time, Brazil's presidents were chosen by an electoral college, and the movement aimed to restore voting rights to the Brazilian population. TV Globo's coverage of the Diretas Já movement has been highly criticized for downplaying the movement's significance and for misrepresenting the size and importance of the demonstrations. The network's editorial choices during that time were seen as being aligned with or supportive of the interests of those in power, including the military regime and associated political figures who were reluctant to relinquish control and move to a fully democratic election system. One particularly notable example of TV Globo's coverage was the reporting on the Diretas Já rally in São Paulo on April 16, 1984, which is considered one of the largest public demonstrations in the history of Brazil. Rather than giving emphasis to the democratic demand of the event, Globo's flagship news program, Jornal Nacional, underplayed the rally, instead focusing on the anniversary of São Paulo and unrelated events, and downplayed the number of attendees. As mentioned earlier, years later, in 2013, TV Globo publicly acknowledged that its coverage of the Diretas Já movement was mistaken. The network admitted that its editorial line, which minimized the coverage of the movement, did not effectively serve the democratic interests of Brazilian society. This apology was part of a broader reflection in Brazilian society on the media's role during the military dictatorship, and today, the Diretas Já movement is considered a significant moment in Brazil's path to re-establishing democracy."},{"instruction":"What Did Santiago Look like During 1974?","output":"Santiago, the capital city of Chile, experienced a period of significant turmoil and transformation during the year 1974. The following aspects define Santiago and Chile at that period: **Political Climate:** In 1973, Chile underwent a dramatic political shift when the democratically elected Marxist President, Salvador Allende, was overthrown in a military coup led by General Augusto Pinochet on September 11. By 1974, General Pinochet had solidified his control over the country, marking the beginning of a dictatorship that would last until 1990. The new military government imposed a curfew, banned public gatherings, and began to heavily censor the media. **Human Rights and Repression:** The military regime quickly established a repressive system characterized by human rights abuses. This included widespread arrests of political opponents, leftists, and perceived subversives. Detention centers, such as the infamous Estadio Nacional, were used to imprison and torture thousands of Chileans. Fear and silence became notable aspects of daily life in Santiago, as people were afraid to oppose the regime openly. **Economy and Daily Life:** The Pinochet regime initiated economic changes that moved Chile from a socialist economy towards neoliberal economic policies, influenced by a group of Chilean economists known as the \\"Chicago Boys.\\" While these reforms would drastically transform the Chilean economy in the long term, in 1974, the country was still facing the economic disruptions caused by the political upheaval, with issues like inflation, shortages of goods, and unemployment affecting daily life. **The Cityscape:** Architecturally and urbanistically, Santiago in the 1970s would have looked less developed than it does today, with fewer high-rise buildings and less extensive infrastructure. The growth of shantytowns, or \\"poblaciones,\\" which began in the late 1960s due to rural-urban migration, continued as people sought better opportunities in the city. **Cultural Expression:** Cultural expression faced significant limitations due to censorship. Music, literature, theater, and other forms of art that criticized the regime or promoted socialist ideas were often banned. Nonetheless, artists found ways to resist and express their opposition through veiled messages in their works or by organizing underground events and performances. Photos and historical accounts from that time offer a glimpse into the appearance and vibe of Santiago in 1974—a city marked by political unrest, repression, and significant social transformations that were starting to unfold under a new dictatorial regime. The repercussions of this era are felt even today in Chilean society and have shaped the memory and identity of the nation."},{"instruction":"What Would An 20% Satirical Version Of Santiago During 1974 Look Like?","output":"Creating a satirical depiction of a time and place as fraught as Santiago in 1974 requires a delicate balance given the severity of the political and social climate at the time. Satire typically exaggerates certain elements to highlight absurdities or ironies. To imagine a 20% satirical version of Santiago during this period, one might magnify certain aspects without losing sight of the context: 1. **Exaggerated Dictatorship Iconography:** - Caricatures of military personnel could be seen on every corner, displaying exaggeratedly large medals and ribbons, poking fun at the military's obsession with rank and appearance. - Satirical murals or graffiti portraying the government as paternal figures scolding tiny representations of the citizenry, emphasizing the infantilization of the public by the regime. 2. **Mockery of Censorship:** - \\"Fashionable\\" censorship bars could be added to everyday objects, lampooning the regime's attempt to control information, as citizens \\"self-censor\\" their conversations with visible, mock serious expressions. - Parodic newspapers with absurd headlines that make light of the lack of real news, filled with nonsensical, positive spins on dire situations. 3. **Economic Exaggerations:** - Store shelves comically stocked with just one product to illustrate the absurdity of economic policies that led to shortages. - Citizens might be depicted exchanging bizarre objects as currency or barter due to inflation, such as trading a wheelbarrow of rocks for a loaf of bread. 4. **Ridiculous Security Measures:** - Security forces using humorous, oversized listening devices and binoculars, symbolizing the regime's paranoia and the extensive surveillance of everyday life. - Over-the-top neighborhood watches humorously volunteering to report even the most mundane activities to mock the climate of mutual distrust and the culture of informants. 5. **Absurd Transportation:** - People could be shown commuting in the city using ridiculous modes of transportation, like unicycles or roller skates, to sidestep an imagined fuel rationing or car prohibition by the government. 6. **Satirical Public Campaigns:** - Fictitious government campaigns asking people to \\"smile more\\" to project an illusion of happiness and stability or \\"report your neighbor's subversive pets\\" as a sardonic take on overzealous security efforts. 7. **Ironized Cultural Life:** - Underground theaters showing overtly patriotic plays that are comically misunderstood by audiences as high comedy. - Bands whose instruments are all out of tune or playing different songs at the same time to signify the dissonance between public sentiment and state-approved messaging. It's important to underline that satire related to such a repressive period would need to be approached with sensitivity to ensure that it underscores the absurdity of the regime's actions without trivializing the very real suffering and human rights abuses endured by the population. Any humorous take on historical traumas requires careful thought to avoid misinterpretation and to respect those affected by the period in question."},{"instruction":"Translate into Burmese: မင်္ဂလာပါ။ ကျွန်တော့်နာမည်က David Santos ပါ။","output":"မင်္ဂလာပါ။ ကျွန်တော့်နာမည်ဟု David Santos ဖြစ်သည်။"},{"instruction":"Translate into English: မင်္ဂလာပါ။ ကျွန်တော့်နာမည်က David Santos ပါ။","output":"Hello.

The 1970s was a turbulent decade for Chile. In 1973, a military coup led by General Augusto Pinochet overthrew the democratically elected government of Salvador Allende. The years that followed were marked by political oppression, human rights violations, and economic changes under Pinochet's dictatorship which lasted until 1990. This had a significant impact on the daily life and expressions of the Chilean people. Fashion and personal appearance during the mid-1970s would have been influenced by both international trends and the local political and economic situation: **Global Fashion Trends:** 1. **Hair:** Teenagers often had longer hairstyles for both men and women, with men sporting styles that might include shaggy layers or feathered cuts, and women wearing their hair long, straight, or in Farrah Fawcett-style waves. 2. **Clothing:** Popular clothing for teens included flared pants, fitted shirts for men, and blouses with patterns or embroidery for women. Denim was popular, and both sexes might wear jeans or denim jackets. 3. **Accessories:** Accessories might include belts, bracelets, and necklaces. Sunglasses with larger frames were also in vogue. **Chilean Context:** 1. **Economic Constraints:** The economic situation in Chile may have limited access to luxury goods and the latest fashions for the average teenager. Thus, clothing and style might have been more modest or practical. 2. **Cultural Norms:** Chilean fashion might have been somewhat conservative given the political climate and the influence of traditional values. 3. **Political Influence:** Symbols of political affiliation or dissent could be subtle due to the repressive nature of the regime. Thus, clothing and personal style might have been subdued to avoid attracting unwanted attention. Remember that the look of any teenager can vary widely based on personal taste, socioeconomic status, and regional differences. While the upper classes might have had access to international fashion, lower-income teens would have been more influenced by local trends and affordability. Photos, films, and literature from the period could offer more visual cues, but keep in mind that these sources might not fully represent the diversity of experiences and appearances of Chilean teenagers in 1976."},{"instruction":"hello","output":"Hello!

He is a member of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which generally advocates for Taiwan's sovereignty and identity separate from the People's Republic of China. Lai Ching-te's political positions are consistent with the DPP's platform as well as his own statements and policy initiatives from his political career. Some of his positions include: 1. **Taiwan's Independence and Sovereignty**: Lai is a strong advocate for Taiwan's sovereignty and has called for the international community to recognize Taiwan as an independent country separate from China. He has been vocal about protecting Taiwan's democratic way of life and has taken a firm stance against Beijing's \\"One Country, Two Systems\\" model. 2. **Cross-Strait Relations**: Although Lai supports Taiwan's formal independence, as Premier, he maintained that peaceful relations and stability across the Taiwan Strait were crucial. However, he is known for taking a more pro-independence stance than some other members of the DPP, including President Tsai Ing-wen. 3. **Domestic Policies**: During his tenure as Premier, Lai focused on domestic issues, including pension reform, economic development, social welfare, and environmental protection. He pushed for reforms aimed at improving the sustainability of Taiwan's pension system and supported initiatives that would stimulate economic growth and innovation. 4. **Social Issues**: Lai has supported progressive social policies, including LGBTQ+ rights. Under his premiership, Taiwan moved towards legalizing same-sex marriage, which culminated in the island becoming the first place in Asia to do so in 2019. 5. **Environment and Energy**: Lai has advocated for environmental protection and sustainable development. The DPP government has set targets to reduce carbon emissions and transition Taiwan away from nuclear power towards renewable energy sources. 6. **Public Health**: As a former physician, Lai has expressed support for maintaining and improving Taiwan's healthcare system, which is known for providing high-quality and accessible healthcare services to its citizens. 7. **Response to COVID-19**: As Vice President during the COVID-19 pandemic, Lai supported the government's successful efforts to contain the virus, which included strict border controls and comprehensive contact tracing, among other measures. Lai's political career may evolve over time, and his positions might adjust according to the changing political landscape and issues facing Taiwan. It is important to review the most recent statements and policy proposals from Lai and the DPP for the latest insights into his political positions."},{"instruction":"Is Bufferbloat not a server's problem, rather router's or switch's problem?","output":"Bufferbloat is typically an issue with network devices like routers and switches, not servers. It refers to the phenomenon where excessive buffering of packets in network devices causes high latency and jitter in packet delivery. Essentially, when packets are held too long in a device's buffer, it can lead to delays and reduced network performance, particularly under load. The problem arises because, when network traffic exceeds a device's ability to process it, the device starts to queue the packets. If it has very large buffers and continues to queue packets in an attempt to prevent packet loss, the result is an increase in the time it takes for packets to move through the network. This increased latency can make real-time applications like voice-over-IP or online gaming perform poorly. Bufferbloat can occur in any part of a network where there are buffers, but it's most commonly associated with activity in routers and switches because these devices often manage varying rates of traffic and must handle bursts of data. Consumer-grade routers are especially prone to bufferbloat because they may have large buffers that aren't managed as effectively as those in higher-end equipment. Solving bufferbloat often involves implementing smart queuing algorithms such as Active Queue Management (AQM) techniques like CoDel (Controlled Delay) or fq_codel (Fair Queuing Controlled Delay) to manage how buffers are filled and emptied. These mechanisms aim to keep latency low while still accommodating bursts of network traffic and preventing packet loss. So, while a server can contribute to network congestion and may be affected by the symptoms of bufferbloat when accessing network resources, the server itself is not typically the source of bufferbloat. Instead, the network infrastructure (routers, switches, and sometimes modems) is generally where bufferbloat management needs to be addressed."},{"instruction":"What Was DINA?","output":"DINA, which stands for Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional, was the Chilean secret police during the dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet after the coup that overthrew President Salvador Allende on September 11, 1973. DINA was established in November 1973 and played a key role in the repression during the early years of the military regime. The agency was responsible for the surveillance, persecution, kidnapping, torture, and extermination of opposition members, including left-wing activists, political opponents, and suspected subversive elements within Chile. Under the leadership of Colonel Manuel Contreras and with the backing of the military junta, DINA operated with little oversight and engaged in numerous human rights abuses, both within Chile and overseas, as part of Operation Condor, a campaign of political repression and state terror involving intelligence operations and assassination of opponents implemented by right-wing dictatorships in the Southern Cone of South America. The notoriety of DINA's brutal tactics and the widespread human rights violations it perpetrated led to international condemnation. Due to growing pressure and a desire to rebrand the intelligence apparatus, DINA was officially disbanded in 1977 and later replaced by the Central Nacional de Informaciones (CNI), although this new organization continued many of the repressive activities of its predecessor until the end of the Pinochet regime in 1990."},{"instruction":"What Would An 20% Satirical Version of Manila During 1986 Look Like?","output":"Creating a 20% satirical version of Manila in 1986 involves infusing some elements of exaggeration, irony, and humor into the situation of the time while still retaining a mostly accurate portrayal of the era. The year 1986 was a pivotal one in Philippine history due to the People Power Revolution, which led to the fall of the long-time authoritarian ruler Ferdinand Marcos and the restoration of democracy under President Corazon Aquino. Here are a few ways to sketch a satirical take on Manila during that year: 1. **Political Climate Overdramatization**: You could exaggerate the intense political rivalry with caricatures of political figures. Picture a city peppered with campaign posters that are so large they block the sun, featuring larger-than-life and overly dramatic portrayals of Marcos and Aquino supporters engaged in comical demonstrations of loyalty. 2. **Economic Exaggeration**: The Philippine economy was in dire straits. Satirically, you might depict it as being so bad that people were using devalued currency for paper mache or that 'Buy one, get ten free' deals were the norm in an over-the-top effort to keep commerce going. 3. **Cultural Hyperbole**: Capture the Filipino spirit but with a twist—sinkers in karaoke machines that eject singers for off-key renditions of popular songs, or the jeepneys are depicted as transforming robots (a playful nod to the Transformers craze of the 1980s) ferrying people to revolutionary rallies. 4. **Military and Security Exaggeration**: Philippine Constabulary and military checkpoints might be satirically reimagined as elaborate game show setups where citizens participate in absurd contests to pass through. 5. **International Relations Satire**: The presence of international media and foreign governments' interests could be lampooned by depicting foreign spies comically trying to blend in at Filipino street food stalls or embassies hosting \\"democracy-themed\\" fiesta parties. 6. **People Power Absurdity**: The momentous events at EDSA could be gently satirized by showing a surreal, festive atmosphere, with exaggerated fiesta-like caricatures of nuns facing down tanks, or citizens painting vibrant graffiti and street art on military armor. 7. **Marcos Regime Parody**: Imelda Marcos's extensive shoe collection could be portrayed as a central plot in a fictional Manila, where shoes have become the city's unofficial currency, with people making deals and trades based on the value of different pairs. When creating satirical content like this, it is crucial to strike the right balance between humor and respect, especially considering the dark times and struggles many people endured. Satire can offer a lens to critique and reflect upon historical events, but it should be done thoughtfully to avoid minimizing the real suffering and heroism of those involved."},{"instruction":"How do I fade out an object in Unity using opaque material","output":"In Unity, Rendering with Opaque materials means they cannot be transparent by default. Opaque materials are typically used for objects that are not see-through, like walls, floors, and characters. To fade out an object with an opaque material, you will have to switch the material to use a shader that supports transparency. One such shader is Unity's standard shader which can be switched between opaque, cutout, fade, and transparent blending modes. Here are the steps you'd follow to fade out an object with an otherwise opaque material: 1. **Create a new material or change the existing one:** - In the Project view, right-click and select \\"Create\\" > \\"Material\\". - Name the material appropriately. - In the material's Inspector, under the 'Shader' dropdown, select \\"Universal Render Pipeline\\" > \\"Lit\\" (or \\"Standard\\" if you are not using Universal Render Pipeline). 2. **Configure the material for transparency:** - In the material's Inspector, change the \\"Surface Type\\" from \\"Opaque\\" to \\"Transparent\\". For the built-in standard shader, locate the \\"Rendering Mode\\" and change it to \\"Fade\\" or \\"Transparent\\". 3. **Assign the material to your object:** - Drag the newly configured material onto the object you wish to fade out, or select the object, go to the Mesh Renderer or Skinned Mesh Renderer component in the Inspector, and replace the material slot with your new material. 4. **Fade out the object using a script:** - In order to animate the transparency of the material to achieve a fade-out effect, you can write a simple script in C#. Here is an example script that fades out an object over time: \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; public class FadeOutObject : MonoBehaviour { public float fadeDuration = 2.0f; private Material fadeMaterial; private float currentTime = 0.0f; void Start() { // Get the renderer component and access the material Renderer renderer = GetComponent<Renderer>(); if (renderer != null) { fadeMaterial = renderer.material; } } void Update() { if (fadeMaterial != null) { currentTime += Time.deltaTime; float alpha = Mathf.Lerp(1.0f, 0.0f, currentTime / fadeDuration); // Fade out the material Color color = fadeMaterial.color; color.a = alpha; fadeMaterial.color = color; // Optional: Destroy the object when fully transparent if (alpha <= 0.0f) { Destroy(gameObject); } } } } \`\`\` Make sure to attach this script to the object you wish to fade out. The script linearly interpolates the alpha value of the material's color over a duration specified by \`fadeDuration\` until the object is completely transparent. Keep in mind that working with transparency can be performance-intensive, and sorting issues can arise with other transparent objects. Typically, fade effects are better suited to materials already configured for transparency. When an object is expected to fade in or fade out occasionally, it is a good practice to have a duplicate material that is used for fading, to switch to when needed."},{"instruction":"I want you to improve this script, complete the night action, each village should move to the closest house, but each house has a stablished villagerCapacity, if house is full search for next close house, associate the house with the villager using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using Game.Systems.Buildings; using UnityEngine; namespace Game.Systems { public class HousingManager : MonoBehaviour { private List<House> houses = new List<House>(); public void Init() { GameManager.Instance.OnDayStart += DayAction; GameManager.Instance.OnNightStart += NightAction; } public void DayAction(object sender, EventArgs args) { } public void NightAction(object sender, EventArgs args) { List<Villager> villagers = GameManager.Instance.VillagerTracker.GetVillagers(); foreach (var villager in villagers) { } } public void AddHouse(House house) { if (!houses.Contains(house)) { houses.Add(house); } } public void RemoveHouse(House house) { if (houses.Contains(house)) { houses.Remove(house); } } private void OnDestroy() { GameManager.Instance.OnDayStart -= DayAction; GameManager.Instance.OnNightStart -= NightAction; } } }","output":"To improve the script and complete the night action, we need to iterate through each villager and assign them to the closest house, taking into account the capacity of the houses.

It should also have a method to add a villager (e.g., \`AddVillager(Villager villager)\`). The \`Villager\` class would similarly have a method for assigning a house (e.g., \`AssignHouse(House house)\`). This is just an example of how you could implement this system. Depending on the structure of your \`House\` and \`Villager\` classes, you may need to adjust the methods and properties used in the script.

Да, можно перенести часть данных из одной базы Room в обновлённую версию базы, даже если структура таблиц была изменена. Для этого используйте механизм миграции базы данных, который предоставляется Room. Вот как можно сделать это: 1. Определите новую схему базы данных - Обновите классы сущностей (\`@Entity\`) и версию базы данных в аннотации \`@Database\`. 2. Cоздайте миграцию - Вы должны создать объект \`Migration\`, который описывает, как перейти от одной версии схемы базы данных к другой. В методе \`migrate\` вы можете использовать SQLite-операторы для переноса данных. \`\`\`java static RoomDatabase.Callback roomCallback = new RoomDatabase.Callback() { @Override public void onCreate(@NonNull SupportSQLiteDatabase db) { super.onCreate(db); // вызываем миграцию при создании базы данных db.execSQL(\\"...\\"); } @Override public void onOpen(@NonNull SupportSQLiteDatabase db) { super.onOpen(db); // вызываем миграцию при открытии базы данных db.execSQL(\\"...\\"); } }; \`\`\` 3. Укажите миграцию при построении экземпляра базы данных - При создании экземпляра базы данных \`Room.databaseBuilder()\` вам нужно добавить миграцию (или миграции, если они последовательные для нескольких версий схемы). \`\`\`java Room.databaseBuilder(appContext, AppDatabase.class, \\"database-name\\") .addMigrations(MIGRATION_1_2, MIGRATION_2_3, ...) .build(); \`\`\` 4. Используйте метод \`migrate\`, чтобы выполнить необходимые операции для изменения схемы и переноса данных (если это требуется). Пример миграции для изменения схемы таблицы: \`\`\`java // Миграция от версии 1 к версии 2 static final Migration MIGRATION_1_2 = new Migration(1, 2) { @Override public void migrate(SupportSQLiteDatabase database) { // Пример миграционного запроса: // Создаем новую таблицу database.execSQL(\\"CREATE TABLE users_new (id INTEGER, name TEXT, new_column TEXT, PRIMARY KEY(id))\\"); // Копируем данные из старой таблицы database.execSQL(\\"INSERT INTO users_new (id, name, new_column) SELECT id, name, '' FROM users\\"); // Удаляем старую таблицу database.execSQL(\\"DROP TABLE users\\"); // Переименовываем новую таблицу database.execSQL(\\"ALTER TABLE users_new RENAME TO users\\"); } }; \`\`\` Не забудьте также обновить версию в файле схемы базы данных, если вы её контролируете.

Если вы установили параметр \`exportSchema = false\` в вашей базе данных Room и не имеете схемы базы данных из предыдущих версий, создание миграции может быть сложнее, но всё равно возможно. Даже без предыдущей схемы вы можете определить операции миграции, которые нужно выполнить для изменения структуры таблиц и переноса данных. Ключевым моментом является то, что Room не требует наличия схемы для выполнения миграций. Вместо этого exportSchema используется для документирования вашей схемы базы данных в виде файлов JSON, что может быть полезно для контроля версий и обзора изменений в базе данных. Если текущая структура базы данных изменится и у вас не будет предыдущих схем для сравнения, вам нужно будет самостоятельно знать, какие именно изменения были сделаны, и, на основе этого знания, создать миграцию для Room. Вот пример создания миграции на Kotlin без использования схемы: \`\`\`kotlin val MIGRATION_1_2 = object : Migration(1, 2) { override fun migrate(database: SupportSQLiteDatabase) { // Действия по обновлению схемы и переносу данных database.execSQL(\\"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS \`NewTable\` (\`id\` INTEGER, \`name\` TEXT, PRIMARY KEY(\`id\`))\\") // ... другие изменения // Перенос данных, если это необходимо // ... } } val db = Room.databaseBuilder( applicationContext, AppDatabase::class.java, \\"database-name\\" ) .addMigrations(MIGRATION_1_2) .build() \`\`\` Важно тщательно протестировать миграцию перед релизом обновления, чтобы убедиться, что она корректно обрабатывает все данные и сохраняет их целостность. Если структура данных меняется так радикально, что простое применение миграций к существующим данным не является возможным или практичным, вы можете рассмотреть альтернативные подходы: 1. Использовать временные таблицы для сохранения данных перед обновлением структуры. 2. Экспортировать данные в формате JSON или XML, обновить структуру базы данных, а затем импортировать данные обратно. 3. Сбросить базу данных и загрузить данные заново с сервера или другого источника, если это применимо к вашему приложению.

Это может быть момент запуска приложения, когда вы обнаруживаете, что требуется миграция до новой версии базы данных. Приложение может проверить версию базы и в случае необходимости выполнить резервное копирование данных. Для экспорта данных можно использовать следующий код: \`\`\`kotlin fun exportDatabaseToJson(context: Context): String { val database = Room.databaseBuilder(context, AppDatabase::class.java, \\"database-name\\").build() val users = database.userDao().getAllUsers() // Пример для пользовательской таблицы return Gson().toJson(users) } \`\`\` Необходимо сохранить полученный JSON-файл в приватном хранилище приложения или в общедоступной папке, если у пользователя есть доступ к этим файлам через файловый менеджер. Важно также обращать внимание на разрешения доступа к файловой системе и соответствующие механизмы хранения, введенные в последних версиях Android. 2. **Импорт данных после обновления:** После обновления приложения, при первом запуске новой версии, проверьте, есть ли сохраненный JSON-файл с данными. Если файл существует, загрузите данные из него и сохраните в вашу новую базу данных. Пример кода для импорта данных из JSON: \`\`\`kotlin fun importDatabaseFromJson(context: Context, json: String) { val database = Room.databaseBuilder(context, AppDatabase::class.java, \\"database-name\\").build() val userType = object : TypeToken<List<User>>() {}.type val users: List<User> = Gson().fromJson(json, userType) database.userDao().insertAll(users) } \`\`\` Эту операцию рекомендуется выполнять в фоновом потоке, чтобы не блокировать главный поток пользовательского интерфейса, т.к. операция чтения из файла и записи в базу данных может занять некоторое время. Необходимо учитывать, что экспорт и импорт сложных структур данных может быть не таким простым и требовать дополнительного программирования для обработки связей. Также следует помнить, что Gson() в примерах выше это библиотека конвертации объектов Java в JSON и обратно, её нужно добавить в зависимости проекта чтобы использовать: \`\`\`gradle implementation 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.6' \`\`\` **Технические моменты:** - Автоматизация процесса экспорта-импорта данных предполагает хорошую обработку ошибок и логирование, чтобы в случае неожиданных сбоев можно было восстановить потерянные данные. - Убедитесь, что у пользователя есть разрешения для записи файла в память устройства, если это необходимо с учётом требований Android 10 (API уровень 29) и выше. - Прежде чем предпринимать экспорт данных, подумайте об их конфиденциальности и о том, как этот процесс соответствует политике конфиденциальности и защите персональных данных. - Регулярно тестируйте процесс переноса данных, чтобы минимизировать риск потери информации при реальных обстоятельствах."},{"instruction":"напиши эссе по цитате «Тот, кто не ведет себя соответственно своему возрасту, всегда расплачивается за это» (Вольтер).","output":"Вольтер, выдающийся французский писатель и философ Просвещения, в своей цитате отмечает важность соответствия своему возрасту в поведении и действиях. Он утверждает, что люди, не придерживающиеся соответствующего поведения в соответствии с возрастом, обязательно столкнутся с последствиями этого. Существует множество моментов, которые подтверждают эту мудрую мысль Вольтера. Одним из таких примеров является отсутствие самоконтроля и недостаток ответственности в молодом возрасте. Молодежь, не ведущая себя соответственно своему возрасту, часто сталкивается с различными сложностями и проблемами, такими как неудачная учеба, проблемы в отношениях с окружающими и в целом негативное влияние на свое будущее. Отсутствие соответствующего поведения в молодом возрасте часто провоцирует создание негативных привычек и стереотипов, которые могут сказаться на всей жизни. С другой стороны, если человек не ведет себя соответственно своему возрасту в старшие годы, это также может привести к нежелательным последствиям. Например, недостаток мудрости и зрелости в действиях может привести к конфликтам с окружающими, проблемам в семье или на работе, и в конечном итоге к утрате уважения и поддержки. Таким образом, можно сделать вывод, что соответствие поведения своему возрасту имеет огромное значение для успешной и счастливой жизни человека. Важно находить баланс между своими действиями и возрастными особенностями, стремиться к личностному росту и развитию, а также принимать ответственность за свои поступки.

List these cases and tell the reason of why it is better to decrease the buffer size for a server. Do not consider cases concerning memory availability in the system at all and memory releasing benefits for the system.","output":"In TCP networking, the read buffer (often referred to as the TCP receive window) is used to control the flow of incoming data. It's a part of the flow control mechanism that helps to ensure that the sender doesn't overwhelm the receiver with data. The size of the TCP read buffer is advertised to the sender in order to let them know how much data can be sent before an acknowledgment is required. However, there are situations where the system might determine that it's beneficial to shrink the TCP read buffer, even if there is plenty of memory available. Here are some situations where this might occur: 1. **Bandwidth-Delay Product (BDP) Adjustments**: If the bandwidth-delay product (which represents the maximum amount of unacknowledged data that can be in transit in the network) is smaller than the size of the read buffer, the buffer can be reduced without affecting throughput. This helps to avoid excessive buffering, which could potentially increase latency (also called bufferbloat). 2. **Detecting a Smaller Path MTU**: If there is a change in the path between the sender and receiver and the maximum transmission unit (MTU) decreases, the system might adjust the buffer size downwards to match the new MTU to prevent IP fragmentation. 3. **Congestion Control**: If there is network congestion, TCP may reduce the window size to play nicely with other network traffic and reduce the congestion. This is part of TCP congestion control algorithms like TCP Reno or TCP Cubic. 4. **Receiver Processing Limitations**: If the application reading from the TCP socket cannot keep up with the incoming data rate, the buffer might be purposefully shrunk to signal the sender to slow down. This helps maintain the application's performance without having it be overwhelmed by incoming data. 5. **Idle Connection**: For a connection that has become idle, the system might choose to reduce the buffer size assuming that the traffic characteristics have changed. If the connection goes from a high-throughput to a low-throughput state, a smaller buffer size might be more appropriate. 6. **Estimating Network Conditions**: Some advanced TCP stacks may make use of algorithms to estimate the current network conditions and adjust the buffer accordingly to optimize for latency or throughput. 7. **Path Characteristics Change**: If, for example, the connection path changes due to routing updates (BGP updates) and the new path has characteristics that warrant smaller read buffers, the system might shrink the buffer. This could be due to an increase in latency or a decrease in bandwidth on the new path. 8. **Round-Trip Time (RTT) Variability**: If measurements of RTT variability suggest that the buffer size could be reduced without impacting throughput or increasing latency, the system might opt to reduce the buffer. It's important to note that these adjustments are part of the dynamic nature of TCP networking, which is designed to be self-tuning to a degree. TCP stacks on Linux and other operating systems continuously monitor various factors like round-trip times (RTTs), packet loss, and network congestion to make such adjustments. The decision to decrease the read buffer size on the server side, ignoring memory availability, typically revolves around the desire to optimize connection performance, maintain application responsiveness, and minimize network congestion. However, the specific conditions under which the buffer size might be adjusted can vary depending on the implementation details of the TCP stack and the specific congestion control algorithms in use."},{"instruction":"What Would Pedestrians Say In Santiago During 1976?","output":"In 1976, Santiago, Chile was under the control of the military dictatorship led by General Augusto Pinochet, who took power in a coup d’état in 1973. The Pinochet regime was characterized by strict censorship, repression, and human rights violations. Public expression of dissent was dangerous, and many individuals were wary of discussing politics openly for fear of attracting attention from the regime's secret police, the DINA (Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional). Given this context, pedestrians in Santiago in 1976 would likely have been cautious with their words, especially regarding political matters or anything that could be construed as dissent. They might have talked about daily concerns - such as family, work, the cost of living, and perhaps football, which is a popular topic in Chile. The general public discourse would more likely reflect the circumstances of the time: 1. **Economy and Daily Life**: People might have commented on the economic policies of the regime, such as the \\"Chicago boys\\", a group of Chilean economists educated at the University of Chicago who influenced a free-market reorientation in Chile's economy. Conversations might touch on price changes, scarcity of some products due to the new economic policies, or employment concerns. 2. **Restrictions and Fear**: Although not openly critical, conversations might indirectly reflect the fear and oppression experienced by many Chileans. People might have privately discussed curfews or the presence of military personnel in the streets. 3. **Social Issues**: In hushed tones, individuals might have talked about the social issues of the time, such as the displacement and disappearances of people, known as \\"desaparecidos.\\" However, these would have been very cautious conversations, if they happened at all in public. 4. **Censorship and Propaganda**: The media was heavily censored, so people might mention or react to the limited and government-controlled information available in newspapers, radio, or television. 5. **Culture**: Conversations about culturally \\"safe\\" topics such as music, literature, and film that managed to thrive despite repression could also take place, though again, with an awareness of the political overtones that even cultural conversations could carry. 6. **International Relations**: Chile during this period was diplomatically isolated, so people might talk about the impact of the dictatorship on the country's reputation abroad or the sanctions and relationships with other countries. 7. **Discreet Opposition**: Some individuals, especially those involved in resistance movements or who were critical of the government but had to express this in secret, might have used coded language or met in clandestine gatherings. Direct criticisms of the government, discussions about detained or missing friends or family, and plans for protests or resistance activities would not have been voiced openly in public. Anything along these lines would have happened in private, away from potential informants. Remember that this is a general overview and individuals' experiences would have varied; some may have supported the regime while others were vehemently opposed, yet the climate of fear affected how openly people could speak against the government."},{"instruction":"±-------------------------------------------+ | STATUS | ±---------------------±--------------------+ | Nombre | [Nombre del Aventurero] | ±---------------------±--------------------+ | Nivel | 1 | [Nivel del Aventurero] ±---------------------±--------------------+ | Fatiga | 0 | [Fatiga del Aventurero] ±---------------------±--------------------+ | Trabajo | [Trabajo del Aventurero] | ±---------------------±--------------------+ | Título | [Títulos del Aventurero] | ±---------------------±--------------------+ | Salud (HP) | 100 / 100 | [ Vida del Aventurero] | ±---------------------±--------------------+ | Mana (MP) | 10 / 10 | [Magia del aventurero] | ±---------------------±--------------------+ | Estadísticas | [Lista de estadísticas del Aventurero] | ±---------------------±--------------------+ | - Fuerza | 5 | | Rango [I] | + / - | [Determina la Capacidad Física General del Aventurero] | ±---------------------±--------------------+ | - Agilidad | 5 | | Rango [I] | + / - | [Afecta la capacidad y velocidad de procesamiento así como la cordinación y reacción del Aventurero] | ±---------------------±--------------------+ | - Sentidos | 5 | | Rango [I] | + / - | [Mejora todos los sentidos de manera General vista, oído, olfato, tacto, Gusto y percepción del Aventurero] | ±---------------------±--------------------+ | - Vitalidad | 5 | | Rango [I] | + / - | [La Vitalidad está directamente relacionada con la cantidad de HP o salud del Aventurero incrementa la salud y la resistencia al agotamiento físico.

List these cases and tell the reason of why it is better to decrease the buffer size for a server. Do not consider cases concerning memory availability in the system at all and memory releasing benefits for the system.","output":"In TCP communication on Linux, the size of the receive buffer (read buffer) is crucial for efficient data transfer. Automatically tuning the buffer size is a key aspect of TCP's performance optimization. The TCP stack may shrink the read buffer size when it determines that a smaller buffer would be more optimal for the connection. Here are some scenarios where the TCP read buffer might be reduced, excluding cases involving overall system memory availability: 1. **Bandwidth-Delay Product (BDP) Adjustments**: The ideal buffer size is often based on the Bandwidth-Delay Product, which is the product of the link's capacity (bandwidth) and its round-trip time (RTT). If the connection has a smaller BDP than initially estimated—due to lower bandwidth or decreased latency—it's beneficial to decrease the read buffer size to match the BDP. This minimizes the risk of bufferbloat and keeps the buffer as close to the data \\"in flight\\" as possible. 2. **Congestion Control**: During episodes of network congestion, TCP's congestion control algorithm may suggest shrinking the receive buffer to avoid contributing to the congestion. If the sender's congestion window (cwnd) is reduced as a reaction to congestion indications (such as packet loss signaled by duplicate ACKs or explicit congestion notification), it may be beneficial to correspondingly decrease the receive buffer size, leading to a more stable flow of data. 3. **Application Limited**: Sometimes, the receiving application may not be consuming data as quickly as it's being received. In this case, the read buffer does not need to be large since the application is the bottleneck, not the network. Adjusting the buffer size downwards can lead to a more efficient use of resources without impacting application performance. 4. **Receiver Silly Window Syndrome (SWS) Avoidance**: TCP has mechanisms to prevent \\"silly window syndrome,\\" where the receiver advertises very small windows that are inefficient to use. The receiver may shrink the buffer if the application reading from it is doing so in small chunks, to prevent advertising small windows that could lead to SWS. 5. **Idle Connection**: If a connection is mostly idle or the data flow rate is very low compared to the allocated read buffer size, the TCP stack can decide to shrink the buffer. This can be observed in long-lived connections that are occasionally used. By reducing the buffer size, the system optimizes resource utilization without affecting the user experience. 6. **Streamlined Back-Pressure**: When the system or application wants to apply back-pressure to slow down the sender, reducing the receive buffer can be a mechanism to signal the sender to reduce the speed of data transmission. This can help to synchronize the flow between the producer and the consumer. It's worth noting that most modern operating systems use auto-tuning algorithms to adjust buffer sizes dynamically based on observed network conditions and application behavior. These adjustments are meant to optimize network throughput and resource utilization under diverse conditions while minimizing latency and avoiding unnecessary network congestion."},{"instruction":"±-------------------------------------------+ | STATUS | ±---------------------±--------------------+ | Nombre | [Nombre del Aventurero] | ±---------------------±--------------------+ | Nivel | 1 | [Nivel del Aventurero] ±---------------------±--------------------+ | Fatiga | 0 | [Fatiga del Aventurero] ±---------------------±--------------------+ | Trabajo | [Trabajo del Aventurero] | ±---------------------±--------------------+ | Título | [Títulos del Aventurero] | ±---------------------±--------------------+ | Salud (HP) | 100 / 100 | [ Vida del Aventurero] | ±---------------------±--------------------+ | Mana (MP) | 10 / 10 | [Magia del aventurero] | ±---------------------±--------------------+ | Estadísticas | [Lista de estadísticas del Aventurero] | ±---------------------±--------------------+ | - Fuerza | 5 | | Rango [I] | + / - | [Determina la Capacidad Física General del Aventurero] | ±---------------------±--------------------+ | - Agilidad | 5 | | Rango [I] | + / - | [Afecta la capacidad y velocidad de procesamiento así como la cordinación y reacción del Aventurero] | ±---------------------±--------------------+ | - Sentidos | 5 | | Rango [I] | + / - | [Mejora todos los sentidos de manera General vista, oído, olfato, tacto, Gusto y percepción del Aventurero] | ±---------------------±--------------------+ | - Vitalidad | 5 | | Rango [I] | + / - | [La Vitalidad está directamente relacionada con la cantidad de HP o salud del Aventurero incrementa la salud y la resistencia al agotamiento físico.

Historically, the Korean Peninsula and the Japanese archipelago have had cultural and political interactions for centuries, and there have been periods of both conflict and exchange. Here are a few points to consider: 1. **Linguistic Relationship**: The Korean and Japanese languages are both considered language isolates, meaning they do not clearly belong to any language family. However, some linguists hypothesize that they could be part of the proposed Altaic language family or have a common ancestral language in the controversial Altaic hypothesis. Others propose a language family known as the \\"Koreo-Japonic\\" or \\"Japanese-Korean\\" language family. Despite these theories, there is no consensus regarding their linguistic relationship, and many linguists remain skeptical of these connections. 2. **Genetic Studies**: Genetic studies have shown that modern Koreans and Japanese people share some genetic similarities, but also have distinct genetic markers. This suggests a complex history of migrations and interactions. The degree of relatedness varies depending on which populations within each country are compared. 3. **Cultural and Historical Exchanges**: Throughout history, there has been significant cultural exchange between Korea and Japan. For example, during the Asuka period (538–710 AD), Japan actively imported culture, technology, and political systems from the Korean kingdoms and China. This included the introduction of Buddhism to Japan, which likely came through Korea. There were also historical periods where the Japanese invaded the Korean Peninsula, the most notable being the Imjin War in the late 16th century and the colonial period in the early 20th century. 4. **Archaeological Evidence**: Some archaeological evidence, such as similar pottery styles found in both Korea and Japan, suggests prehistoric interactions and migrations. The Yayoi people, who brought rice cultivation to Japan from the Korean Peninsula around 300 BC, might be one example of such migration and cultural exchange. In summary, while there are similarities and historical connections between the Japanese and Korean people, their relationship is complex and reflects a long history of both shared influences and separate development. It is difficult to make a simple statement about their relatedness without taking into account the multidimensional aspects of historical interactions, genetic backgrounds, and cultural exchanges."},{"instruction":"Как ты думаешь по стилю этой речи, какие эти рассказы были написаны одним и тем же автором, а какие разными? Попробуй сделать предположения о возрасте, поле и национальности автора (считай это игрой в угадалку). Рассказ 1: Гибель полубога Снега объяли его. На горе стоял Лэй, держа небеса. Война смертных с богами достигла апогея. Люди, подстрекаемые титанами, думали, что, разрушив мировые столпы, они сокрушат царство небес. Наивно. Если небо падёт, то и земля погибнет. Души людей, подвергнувшись скверне титанов, обращались в чудовищ. Три чёрных змия человеческих душ направились к столпам на священных горах. Отец небес отправил на защиту опор сыновей. Средь них и Лэй, дитя пастушки, покорившей сердце верховного бога. Долгие годы юноша жил среди смертных и оберегал их. Когда же лживые слова титанов легли на языки народа, то изгнан был из родного края и вознёсся к богам. Теперь же вместе с братьями сражался против чудищ. Змей разрушил столп, охраняемый юным полубогом, но и сам сгинул в бою. Небеса задрожали, Лэй подхватил их на могучие плечи. В трещины брони влетал ветер и раззадоривал раны. Чем закончится война? Юноше, держащему небо, теперь не узнать. Ведает только, что обратившись в несокрушимую скалу, сохранит землю. Рассказ 2: Дуб Остановка в этом порту была внеплановый, но обстоятельства требовали. Пользуясь моментом, моряк изучал улочки небольшого города и вскоре вышел на площадь. Старинный дуб раскинул здесь тень своих ветвей, под которой расположилось несколько потёртых скамеек, и моряк обосновался на одной из них. Порыв ветер трепал кудрявые волосы, а листья дуба что-то шептали, в этот момент к моряку подошёл старик. Он выглядел не очень приметным, и моряк не сразу заметил, как тот присел рядом и поздоровался: - Доброго дня, молодой человек. Вы издалека, я посмотрю? - Да, наш корабль ненадолго пришвартовался здесь, - широко улыбнулся моряк. – У вас милый городок. И дуб чудесный. - А этот дуб ровесник городу! – вздохнул старик. - Сколько всего он поведал на своём веку! Свадьбы, рождения и взросление детей, весёлые праздники с лихими гуляниями… и, конечное же, войны, смерти, голод, эпидемии… Моряк поднял взгляд на дерево, слушая истории старика. Теперь в шелесте листьев ему слышался голос прошлого, то радостный смех, то горькое рыдание. Он вглядывался в кору, и казалось, что все эти события, хорошие и плохие, радостные и трагичные, большие и малые деверево записывало на своём теле буквами-трещинами. - А скажите… - хотел было спросить моряк, но обнаружил, что старика уже не было рядом. На скамье лежал жёлудь. Моряк аккуратно взял его в руку и подумал: «А когда-то этот великан был таким же маленьким и ничтожным. Но ему повезло попасть на землю и прорости, а твоя доля лежать на этой скамье в тени отца. Но если тебя посадить, ты через много лет станешь таким же великим и могучим, и запишешь на себе свои истории. Представь, как я меняю твою судьбу, забирая отсюда…» Рассказ 3: Парящие острова «Далеко-далеко есть множество парящих островов. Одни, как наш, являются станциями небесного поезда. На других живут свободные народы. Они не находится под охраной Союза Небес, и на их острова поезда не ходят, но иногда свободные прибывают на станции на летучих паромах. Ближе всего к небесам находятся Облачные архипелаги. Там живут великие семьи. Будучи потомками Первых Повелителей, они создали большие города, где в безопасности живут лучшие воины и ремесленники мира со своими семьями. Самые выдающиеся деятели становятся командирами армий и даже вассалами великих семей, получая в надел свой парящий остров. Люди, родившиеся в облачных городах, могут с лёгкостью сделать карьеру и получить достойное образование. Нам стоит только мечтать о таких местах, но бывали и смельчаки со станций добившихся разрешения поселится на облачных архипелагах. Великий герой Златогривый Клод даже стал вассалом семьи Солнечного Пламени. Он смог доказать своё мужество и мастерство на Великом испытании материка, где спас множество своих товарищей, среди которых был наследный принц Солнечного Пламени. На своём облачном острове Клод построил поместье Малого Гало, где поселились его родители и многочисленные братья и сёстры. Также он выкупил свою возлюбленную из темниц Союза Небес, куда она попала из-за козней одного из дворян архипелага. В Малом Гало все дорогие Клоду люди смогли жить спокойной, мирной жизнью». - Мама я тоже стану великим воином, как Клод, и вам с папой тоже не нужно будет столько трудиться! - радостно вскрикнула маленькая Линн. Мама обняла своё рыжеволосое дитя, поцеловав её в темечко. Линн была единственным ребёнком в семье, остальные дети погибли при родах. Отец семейства Дэвид работал шахтёром на опасных землях материка, где добывали звёздные камни, необходимые для обеспечения движения небесного поезда и работ электростанций. Дэвид редко бывал дома, приезжая лишь на несколько недель, а затем снова отправлялся на полгода на материк. Мэри, мать Линн, была швеёй, но большинство её работы приходилось на обычных жителей станции, которые не могли позволить себе дорогие одежды, но иногда бывали заказы от зажиточных жителей, актрис или жён офицеров гарнизона станции. Такие заказы позволяли частично закрыть задолженность по аренде, которая успевала набежать в период задержки зарплаты Дэвида, но несколько лир всегда находилось для покупки сладостей для любимой дочурки. - Милая Линн, девушки опасно становиться воином, - проговорил нежный голос матери. - А как же Серебренная Ро? Даже Юлия Храбрая была великой воительницей! – возмутилась шестилетняя девочка, подскочив в своей кроватке. - Они были особенными людьми своей эпохи, - сказала Мэри, укладывая Линн обратно и укрывая одеялом. - А я у тебя разве не особенная? - с грузными глазами спросила девочка. - Конечно, ты у меня самая-самая особенная, но тебе лучше учиться по книгам, которые купил папа. Так ты сможешь получить базовое образование, и, может быть, попадёшь работать в станционную канцелярию или даже найдёшь мужа среди стражей станции! - Не хочу замуж за вредных стражей! Хочу быть воином и попасть в облачный город! - Почему же вредные? Стражи защищают нас от пиратов и летающих монстров! И даже великие воины хорошо учились! Клод даже был станционным секретарём! Ну, всё спи, милая, уже поздно. Сладких снов, - мама поцеловала дочку и потушила светильник. «Всё равно я стану воином!» - проговорила Линн, поворачиваясь набок и закрывая глаза. Девочке снилось, как она с могучими воинами сражается со страшными монстрами, спасает шахтёров и гуляет по богатым улицам облачного города с мамой и папой... Рассказ 4: Семена надежды Колония поселенцев с Земли, Планета Н-7, 2213 год. В конференц-зале царила мрачная атмосфера. Не успела молодая колония начать новую жизнь, как мне, руководителю поселения, пришлось созвать чрезвычайный совет. Во время подготовки тепличного блока в контейнерах вместо семян культурных растений оказались сорняки. Планы по самоснабжению сорваны чьим-то саботажем. Сейчас мы можем только обсуждать, как лучше распределить остатки провианта на ближайшие несколько месяцев, и надеяться на прибытие резервного шаттла, сигнал которого давно был потерян. Внезапно сотрудница психологической службы что-то неуверенно достала из сумки и положила на стол: - Мне нравится томаты этого сорта... Я тайно пронесла их с собой, хотела попросить посадить... Откинувшись на спинку кресла, я задумался и открыл свой медальон. Там лежали две тыквенные семечки. Вздохнув, я положил их на стол: - Мы с женой увлекались фермерством в своё время... Везли огромные тыквы на выставку… В тот день авария унесла жизнь моей супруги, с тех пор я храню эти семена как память о том дне. Пусть эта память послужит нам. Надеюсь, они ещё пригодны. После собрания я остался с ведущим агрономом обсудить планы на новые семена. Но вскоре в зал стали приходить колонисты. Каждый из них приносил семена. Во время подготовки нашей программы колонизации не учитывали предпочтения участников при подборе сортов. В результате многие решили сделать вот такую контрабанду. Буквально за полчаса чёрный стол был усеян семенами и напоминал звёздное небо, к которому мы так стремились. А ведущий агроном будто звездочёт со слезами на глазах пересчитывал эти звёзды. Рассказ 5: Так и окончилась наша дружба Так и окончилась наша дружба: немецкая пуля во мне, советский штык в его шее. Помниться в отрочестве мы часто бегали вдаль от хутора. Наигравшись вдоволь, валялись на пригорке, душистые травы щекотали наши ступни. Когда возвращались домой, то нас встречали взволнованные матери, а мой суровый отец всё хотел выпороть двух безответственных хлопцев, но Стёпкин папка всё его успокоить пытался: «Дети всё ж...». Прости, Господи, шалости наши! Началась германская война, отцы ушли на фронт, там и полегли, царствие им небесное... Мамка моя от горя померла. В то время мы со Стёпкой уже в училище были... А потом гражданская началась, боролись с красным террором. Однажды махновцы меня ранили, отвёз конь меня в лес. Там лесник с женою меня выходили, а когда большевики пришли, то меня не выдали, сыном своим назвали, мол ранили зелёные за зверя приняв. Сын-то их почил за неделю до моего появления. Так и остался со стариками, решил благодарность им высказать да присмотреть до смертного одра. К тому времени власть вся уже советам принадлежала. Слышал, что многие мои друзья за границу иммигрировали. Подумывал я тоже сбежать, да только сердцу не спокойно было. Не мог я землю родную оставить. Война застала меня под Киевом... В партизаны пошёл. И волей случая пришлось нам бой в деревне дать, в засаду попали. Пулемёт строчил из окна, рванул я туда, ребятам путь к отступлению открыть. Любит жизнь преподносить сюрпризы. Двух фрицев положил, а вот когда из соседней комнаты выскочил третий, мой мосин осечку дал. И тут я взглянул на своего врага, и обомлел: «Стёпка, ты что ли?». После эмиграции Стёпа жил во Франции, а потом фашисты предложили ему воевать против советов. «Дурак, ты же против своего народа сражаешься!», но в ответ я был обвинён в предательстве. Мол, я продался большевикам. Сказал я ему уходить, предать нашу дружбу я не мог. Зато он смог, выстрелом из люгера... Боже, нет мочи боле давать ему позориться! На последнем издыхании я бросился в штыковую. Так и окончилась наша дружба: немецкая пуля во мне, советский штык в его шее.","output":"Опираясь на стили этих пяти рассказов, я предположу, что они были написаны разными авторами с разным фоном, полом и возрастом. Вот мои предположения: Рассказ 1: Гибель полубога Этот рассказ может быть написан человеком, обладающим хорошим знанием мифологии и фентезийного жанра. В стиле ощущается влияние эпической фантастики, возможно, автор молод или средних лет, увлеченный творчеством таких писателей, как Толкин или Мартин. Национальность автора определить сложно, но могу предположить, что он может быть из страны с богатыми мифологическими или литературными традициями, например, из Великобритании, США или России. Пол автора не явно выражен, но следует отметить обилие героических образов и битв, что часто ассоциируется с мужским стилем написания. Рассказ 2: Дуб Этот рассказ представляет собой более лиричный и реалистичный стиль, возможно, европейский, учитывая мотивы, такие как дуб и моряк. Писатель может быть старшего возраста, у которого есть опыт жизни и глубокое проникновение в суть вещей. По стилю кажется, что автор может быть женщиной из-за внимания к деталям, настроению и эмоциям. Рассказ 3: Парящие острова Текст сильно фокусируется на фантастических и романтизированных образах, что может указывать на молодого или воображаемого автора, возможно, пишущего для молодёжной аудитории. Наличие детского персонажа и мечтательных элементов может говорить о женском авторе, который, возможно, проживает в Азии, с учётом некоторых элементов, указывающих на воздушные острова и особенной культуры, что может намекать на влияние аниме или японской культуры. Рассказ 4: Семена надежды Повествование укоренено в научной фантастике с реалистичным подходом к колонизации планет. Автор, возможно, средних лет, с научным или техническим образованием. Написание может быть вдохновлено реальными событиями или современной наукой, и автор, возможно, имеет западное происхождение, учитывая упоминание Земли и детальный научный подход к колонизации другой планеты. Также возможно, что писатель – мужчина, учитывая уклон в сторону практичности и решения кризисных ситуаций. Рассказ 5: Так и окончилась наша дружба Этот рассказ вполне мог быть написан автором постарше, с глубоким пониманием истории и войны. Национальность может быть славянской, вероятно, русской или украинской, учитывая контекст гражданской войны и немецкого вторжения. Сдержанность эмоций и сфокусированность на событиях войны предполагает, что автор мог быть мужчиной. Это всего лишь предположения, построенные на стилистическом анализе, и они могут не соответствовать действительности. Определение авторства по стилю рассказа – задача сложная, и без дополнительной информации трудно делать точные выводы о поле, возрасте и национальности писателя."},{"instruction":"Ты не думаешь, что некоторые эти рассказы мог написать один и тот же человек.","output":"Исходя из предоставленных текстов, можно заметить различия в стиле, тематике и настроении, что на первый взгляд может указывать на разных авторов. Однако, подразумевая, что это задача на определение стиля одного автора, можно предположить, что все эти рассказы могли быть написаны одним и тем же человеком, обладающим мастерством в различных жанрах и способным подстраивать стиль под конкретную задачу или цель. Каждый рассказ демонстрирует определенные литературные качества, такие как внимание к деталям, описание эмоций персонажей и создание ярких образов и миров. Подобное многостороннее талантливое письмо свидетельствует о широте способностей автора. Автор мог экспериментировать с разными голосами и точками зрения, чтобы рассказать уникальные истории. К тому же, в широком диапазоне литературных стилей нет ничего необычного для писателя, который любит играть с различными формами повествования. Если вдуматься, многие известные авторы пишут в разнообразных жанрах и стилях в течение своей карьеры. Наконец, без дополнительной информации о контексте этих рассказов, таком как публикация в одном и том же сборнике или появление на одной интернет-платформе, не удастся однозначно определить, написаны ли все они одним человеком. Писатель может быть чрезвычайно многогранным и талантливым, поэтому это вполне возможно."},{"instruction":"Ну, мы играем в угадайку, поэтому угадывай образы автора или авторов снова, отпираясь от последнего предположения.","output":"Давайте предположим, что все пять рассказов написаны одним и тем же человеком. В таком случае, автор может обладать следующими характеристиками: Пол: Не определен. Автор проявляет богатое воображение и способность вживаться в различные персонажи и среды, что является знаком мастерства писателя, независимо от их пола. Лирические и фантастические элементы могут указывать на женский автор, в то время как эпические и военные эпизоды могут навести на мысль о мужском авторе. Возраст: Может быть либо среднего, либо старшего возраста. Писатель демонстрирует глубокие знания о войне, истории, фантастике и человеческой психологии. Такое разнообразие знаний и стилей часто укрепляется со временем и жизненным опытом. Национальность: Сложно определить. Контент имеет глобальные влияния от псевдо-античных мифов до научной фантастики. Однако пятый рассказ имеет сильные славянские, возможно, российские или украинские корни, и может указывать на автора из этого региона или хорошо знакомого с его историей. Образование и интересы: Автор, вероятно, имеет хорошее образование и широкий кругозор. Интересы могут включать историю, мифологию, психологию, литературное творчество и даже астрономию или ботанику, что видно по содержанию и деталям рассказов. Креативный подход: Автор является очень творческим человеком, способным сочинять истории и создавать миры с разнообразными и сложными настройками. Литературные умения: Автор обладает развитыми литературными навыками, включая создание захватывающих сюжетов, характеров и образных описаний. Умение писать в различных жанрах и стилях указывает на увлекательное восприятие литературы и возможно на опыт работы в этой сфере. Хотя эти предположения носят чисто гипотетический характер, они отражают способность автора манипулировать языком и темами для создания уникальных и разнообразных произведений."},{"instruction":"И всё таки это игра-угадайка. Попробуй дать точные и однозначные ответы по каждому пункту в рамках угадайки.","output":"Понимаю, что это все в духе забавы, посмотрим, что получится: Пол: Мужчина. Предпочтение эпическим сюжетам и описаниям конфликтов может свидетельствовать о классически мужском взгляде на рассказы, хотя усиление эмоциональных и меланхоличных моментов также указывает на глубокую чувственность. Возраст: Средний возраст. Разнообразие упоминаемых событий и знание истории предполагают, что за плечами автора серьезный опыт и широкий диапазон интересов, которые часто развиваются с возрастом. Национальность: Европеец, вероятно из Восточной Европы, учитывая исторические и культурные контексты в рассказах. Образование и интересы: Высокое образование, с акцентом на гуманитарные и возможно филологические дисциплины. Интересы включают историю, фольклор, фантастику, способность создавать разнообразные и детальные миры. Креативный подход: Импульсивный и изобретательный, с любовью к новаторству и экспериментам в различных жанрах. Литературные умения: Опытный писатель с сильным мастерством рассказывания историй, владеющий техниками построения миров и глубокого психологического портретирования персонажей.

Член Международного Союза писателей России \\"Новый Современник\\"","output":"Оценивая мой ответ, я должен признать, что он не совпал с правильным. Мои предположения оказались неточными в нескольких ключевых пунктах. Пол: Я предположила, что автор женщина, но он оказался мужчиной. Это напоминает о том, что определенные художественные стили и темы не обязательно привязаны к полу автора. Возраст: Я предположила возраст 34 года, тогда как автор на самом деле моложе — 23 года. Это демонстрирует, что молодой возраст не является препятствием для создания зрелых и разнообразных литературных произведений. Образование: Я не угадала, предполагая литературное образование, в то время как автор образован в области агрономии. Это показывает, что интересы и увлечения могут пересекаться с самыми разными профессиональными сферами. Интересы: Я верно указала на интересы к истории и мифологии, но упустила геймдизайн, мультипликацию и веб-комиксы, что подчеркивает многогранность интересов автора и его приверженность к различным формам визуального искусства. Творческий подход и литературные умения: В то время как я предположила более широкий подход и опыт писателя, на самом деле автор является начинающим, с конкретными направленными интересами и членом союза писателей, что свидетельствует о его стремлении к профессиональному развитию в литературе. Несмотря на промахи, такие задания являются интересным упражнением в анализе писательского стиля и мотивов. Они напоминают о том, что литературный талант может проявляться в самых неожиданных формах и быть не связанным напрямую с профессиональным образованием или возрастом писателя."},{"instruction":"Посмотри на его рассказы теперь с точки зрения имеющейся информации (для каждого рассказа)","output":"Теперь, имея точные данные об авторе, можно рассматривать каждый рассказ с учетом его возраста, образования, интересов и его литературной траектории. Рассказ 1: Гибель полубога Молодой возраст автора и его интерес к мифологии отражены в фантастической атмосфере рассказа, где главный герой — полубог, воюющий с чудовищами. Эта история может быть вдохновлена любовью автора к веб-комиксам или геймдизайну, где подобная тематика часто встречается. Рассказ также может отражать классические моральные ценности, такие как героизм, честь и долг. Рассказ 2: Дуб Лирический характер этого рассказа может быть продиктован склонностью автора к рефлексии и ценности традиций. Также могут прослеживаться элементы классики и уважение к простым, но глубоким моментам жизни, что соответствует указанному автором направлению творческого подхода о дружбе народов и моральных ценностях. Рассказ 3: Парящие острова В этом рассказе заметна фантазия, свойственная геймдизайну и мультипликации, а также классическая фантастика с элементами приключений. Возможно, это отражение любви автора к созданию сложных миров и визуализации историй, что является важной частью его интересов. Рассказ 4: Семена надежды Научная фантастика и тема колонизации отражает интерес автора к истории и развитию цивилизаций, а также к агрономии, поскольку центральным элементом этой истории являются семена, символ роста и надежды. Этот рассказ показывает его склонность к настройке на позитив и поиск решений даже в кажущихся безвыходных ситуациях. Рассказ 5: Так и окончилась наша дружба Рассказ отображает глубокое осмысление истории и моральных дилемм, с кросс-культурной перспективой военных конфликтов, что может также отражать моральные ценности интересующие автора. Использование исторического контекста и отражение трагической дружбы могут указывать на стремление автора погрузиться в более серьезные темы. Возвращаясь к рассказам с информацией об авторе, видно, что каждый рассказ по-своему отражает его интересы, образование и творческий подход, и даже если это его первые шаги в литературе, он уже способен создавать разнообразные и комплексные миры."},{"instruction":"Взгляни на его рассказы ещё раз и ответь лучше: Рассказ 1: Гибель полубога Снега объяли его. На горе стоял Лэй, держа небеса. Война смертных с богами достигла апогея. Люди, подстрекаемые титанами, думали, что, разрушив мировые столпы, они сокрушат царство небес. Наивно. Если небо падёт, то и земля погибнет. Души людей, подвергнувшись скверне титанов, обращались в чудовищ. Три чёрных змия человеческих душ направились к столпам на священных горах. Отец небес отправил на защиту опор сыновей. Средь них и Лэй, дитя пастушки, покорившей сердце верховного бога. Долгие годы юноша жил среди смертных и оберегал их. Когда же лживые слова титанов легли на языки народа, то изгнан был из родного края и вознёсся к богам. Теперь же вместе с братьями сражался против чудищ. Змей разрушил столп, охраняемый юным полубогом, но и сам сгинул в бою. Небеса задрожали, Лэй подхватил их на могучие плечи. В трещины брони влетал ветер и раззадоривал раны. Чем закончится война? Юноше, держащему небо, теперь не узнать. Ведает только, что обратившись в несокрушимую скалу, сохранит землю. Рассказ 2: Дуб Остановка в этом порту была внеплановый, но обстоятельства требовали. Пользуясь моментом, моряк изучал улочки небольшого города и вскоре вышел на площадь. Старинный дуб раскинул здесь тень своих ветвей, под которой расположилось несколько потёртых скамеек, и моряк обосновался на одной из них. Порыв ветер трепал кудрявые волосы, а листья дуба что-то шептали, в этот момент к моряку подошёл старик. Он выглядел не очень приметным, и моряк не сразу заметил, как тот присел рядом и поздоровался: - Доброго дня, молодой человек. Вы издалека, я посмотрю? - Да, наш корабль ненадолго пришвартовался здесь, - широко улыбнулся моряк. – У вас милый городок. И дуб чудесный. - А этот дуб ровесник городу! – вздохнул старик. - Сколько всего он поведал на своём веку! Свадьбы, рождения и взросление детей, весёлые праздники с лихими гуляниями… и, конечное же, войны, смерти, голод, эпидемии… Моряк поднял взгляд на дерево, слушая истории старика. Теперь в шелесте листьев ему слышался голос прошлого, то радостный смех, то горькое рыдание. Он вглядывался в кору, и казалось, что все эти события, хорошие и плохие, радостные и трагичные, большие и малые деверево записывало на своём теле буквами-трещинами. - А скажите… - хотел было спросить моряк, но обнаружил, что старика уже не было рядом. На скамье лежал жёлудь. Моряк аккуратно взял его в руку и подумал: «А когда-то этот великан был таким же маленьким и ничтожным. Но ему повезло попасть на землю и прорости, а твоя доля лежать на этой скамье в тени отца. Но если тебя посадить, ты через много лет станешь таким же великим и могучим, и запишешь на себе свои истории. Представь, как я меняю твою судьбу, забирая отсюда…» Рассказ 3: Парящие острова «Далеко-далеко есть множество парящих островов. Одни, как наш, являются станциями небесного поезда. На других живут свободные народы. Они не находится под охраной Союза Небес, и на их острова поезда не ходят, но иногда свободные прибывают на станции на летучих паромах. Ближе всего к небесам находятся Облачные архипелаги. Там живут великие семьи. Будучи потомками Первых Повелителей, они создали большие города, где в безопасности живут лучшие воины и ремесленники мира со своими семьями. Самые выдающиеся деятели становятся командирами армий и даже вассалами великих семей, получая в надел свой парящий остров. Люди, родившиеся в облачных городах, могут с лёгкостью сделать карьеру и получить достойное образование. Нам стоит только мечтать о таких местах, но бывали и смельчаки со станций добившихся разрешения поселится на облачных архипелагах. Великий герой Златогривый Клод даже стал вассалом семьи Солнечного Пламени. Он смог доказать своё мужество и мастерство на Великом испытании материка, где спас множество своих товарищей, среди которых был наследный принц Солнечного Пламени. На своём облачном острове Клод построил поместье Малого Гало, где поселились его родители и многочисленные братья и сёстры. Также он выкупил свою возлюбленную из темниц Союза Небес, куда она попала из-за козней одного из дворян архипелага. В Малом Гало все дорогие Клоду люди смогли жить спокойной, мирной жизнью». - Мама я тоже стану великим воином, как Клод, и вам с папой тоже не нужно будет столько трудиться! - радостно вскрикнула маленькая Линн. Мама обняла своё рыжеволосое дитя, поцеловав её в темечко. Линн была единственным ребёнком в семье, остальные дети погибли при родах. Отец семейства Дэвид работал шахтёром на опасных землях материка, где добывали звёздные камни, необходимые для обеспечения движения небесного поезда и работ электростанций. Дэвид редко бывал дома, приезжая лишь на несколько недель, а затем снова отправлялся на полгода на материк. Мэри, мать Линн, была швеёй, но большинство её работы приходилось на обычных жителей станции, которые не могли позволить себе дорогие одежды, но иногда бывали заказы от зажиточных жителей, актрис или жён офицеров гарнизона станции. Такие заказы позволяли частично закрыть задолженность по аренде, которая успевала набежать в период задержки зарплаты Дэвида, но несколько лир всегда находилось для покупки сладостей для любимой дочурки. - Милая Линн, девушки опасно становиться воином, - проговорил нежный голос матери. - А как же Серебренная Ро? Даже Юлия Храбрая была великой воительницей! – возмутилась шестилетняя девочка, подскочив в своей кроватке. - Они были особенными людьми своей эпохи, - сказала Мэри, укладывая Линн обратно и укрывая одеялом. - А я у тебя разве не особенная? - с грузными глазами спросила девочка. - Конечно, ты у меня самая-самая особенная, но тебе лучше учиться по книгам, которые купил папа. Так ты сможешь получить базовое образование, и, может быть, попадёшь работать в станционную канцелярию или даже найдёшь мужа среди стражей станции! - Не хочу замуж за вредных стражей! Хочу быть воином и попасть в облачный город! - Почему же вредные? Стражи защищают нас от пиратов и летающих монстров! И даже великие воины хорошо учились! Клод даже был станционным секретарём! Ну, всё спи, милая, уже поздно. Сладких снов, - мама поцеловала дочку и потушила светильник. «Всё равно я стану воином!» - проговорила Линн, поворачиваясь набок и закрывая глаза. Девочке снилось, как она с могучими воинами сражается со страшными монстрами, спасает шахтёров и гуляет по богатым улицам облачного города с мамой и папой... Рассказ 4: Семена надежды Колония поселенцев с Земли, Планета Н-7, 2213 год. В конференц-зале царила мрачная атмосфера. Не успела молодая колония начать новую жизнь, как мне, руководителю поселения, пришлось созвать чрезвычайный совет. Во время подготовки тепличного блока в контейнерах вместо семян культурных растений оказались сорняки. Планы по самоснабжению сорваны чьим-то саботажем. Сейчас мы можем только обсуждать, как лучше распределить остатки провианта на ближайшие несколько месяцев, и надеяться на прибытие резервного шаттла, сигнал которого давно был потерян. Внезапно сотрудница психологической службы что-то неуверенно достала из сумки и положила на стол: - Мне нравится томаты этого сорта... Я тайно пронесла их с собой, хотела попросить посадить... Откинувшись на спинку кресла, я задумался и открыл свой медальон. Там лежали две тыквенные семечки. Вздохнув, я положил их на стол: - Мы с женой увлекались фермерством в своё время... Везли огромные тыквы на выставку… В тот день авария унесла жизнь моей супруги, с тех пор я храню эти семена как память о том дне. Пусть эта память послужит нам. Надеюсь, они ещё пригодны. После собрания я остался с ведущим агрономом обсудить планы на новые семена. Но вскоре в зал стали приходить колонисты. Каждый из них приносил семена. Во время подготовки нашей программы колонизации не учитывали предпочтения участников при подборе сортов. В результате многие решили сделать вот такую контрабанду. Буквально за полчаса чёрный стол был усеян семенами и напоминал звёздное небо, к которому мы так стремились. А ведущий агроном будто звездочёт со слезами на глазах пересчитывал эти звёзды. Рассказ 5: Так и окончилась наша дружба Так и окончилась наша дружба: немецкая пуля во мне, советский штык в его шее. Помниться в отрочестве мы часто бегали вдаль от хутора. Наигравшись вдоволь, валялись на пригорке, душистые травы щекотали наши ступни.

Так и окончилась наша дружба: немецкая пуля во мне, советский штык в его шее.","output":"Теперь, когда мы обладаем большим количеством информации о самом авторе, можем попытаться приглядеться к текстам под новым углом: Рассказ 1: Гибель полубога Элементы борьбы между смертными и богами отражают любовь автора к истории и мифам. Из его образования в области агрономии следует уважение к природным явлениям, которые служат фоном сцены с битвой полубога против змеев. Также, знания о сельском хозяйстве могли вдохновить описание гармонии человека с природой, даже в контексте фентезийного боя. Тема самопожертвования полубога говорит о моральных ценностях, важных для автора. Рассказ 2: Дуб Этот рассказ отличается более лёгким, возможно, медитативным стилем. Это привносит в рассказ элементы русской литературы, в которой часто встречается обращение к природе как символу непреходящего и вечного. Здесь заложена тема размышлений о времени и истории, которая радуется на своей поверхности каждым жёлудем – намек на знание и любовь к живой природе агронома. Рассказ 3: Парящие острова Описание парящих островов и небесного поезда отражает интерес автора к фантастике и видимо влияние современных fantasy-видеоигр, где такие элементы встречаются довольно часто. Сюжет о маленькой девочке, мечтающей о приключениях и более значимой жизни, возможно, вдохновлен рассказов об анимации и мультипликации. Этот рассказ более всего указывает на молодой возраст автора, его оптимизм и готовность стремиться к большему. Рассказ 4: Семена надежды Здесь может влиять образование автора в агрономии: затрагивается тема семян, символизирующих начало жизни и надежду. Мотив поддержки и продолжения жизни в новых условиях может также обладать ещё большей метафоричностью, символизируя стремление авторов-начинающих к росту и развитию. Рассказ 5: Так и окончилась наша дружба Этот рассказ, казалось бы, выпадает из общей канвы. Он может показываться немного необычным из-за сильно отличающейся тематики, в нем чувствуется глубокое понимание исторического контекста и исследование темной стороны человеческой души. Сильно различный стиль и тематика могут быть результатом любви автора к истории и его умения переняться в другие эпохи, а также стремления показать разнообразные аспекты человеческой натуры. Если смотреть на эти рассказы с знанием фона автора, становится ясно, что его молодость и разносторонние интересы позволяют ему создавать истории с различными настроениями и темами, воплощая в литературе множество идей и жанров."},{"instruction":"Давай снова сыграем в угадайку. К какому типу личности по MBTI относится автор судя по его рассказам?","output":"Игра в угадывание MBTI-типа личности, основываясь только на литературных работах, может быть очень спорной и неточной. Тип индикатора MBTI определяется на основе предпочтений человека во многих областях жизни, а не только на основе его творческих произведений. Тем не менее, если рассматривать рассказы автора и делать предположения об особенностях его личности, то можно предложить следующее: Рассказы показывают большой интерес к разнообразным темам, богатое воображение и способность строить сложные и продуманные миры. Отсюда можно предположить, что автор может обладать интуитивным типом восприятия, что согласуется с буквой \\"N\\" (интуиция) в MBTI. Также произведения демонстрируют фокусировку на внутренних моральных ценностях и идеалах, что может указывать на функцию чувствования, представляемую буквой \\"F\\" (чувствование). Кроме того, в текстах отражается внимание к деталям и организованность сложных фантастических миров, что может быть признаком суждения, обозначаемого буквой \\"J\\" (суждение). Однако определить между экстравертом и интровертом достаточно сложно, но учитывая множественные диалоги и социальные ситуации, прописанные в текстах, можно предположить в сторону экстраверсии, \\"E\\" (экстраверсия). Соединив эти предположения вместе, мы можем сделать догадку, что автор может относится к типу ENFJ (Экстраверт-Интуиция-Чувствование-Суждение), который часто связывают с энергичными, обаятельными и сочувственными личностями, склонными к помощи другим и ориентированным на общение. Однако стоит подчеркнуть, что этот ответ основывается на интерпретации и догадках относительно текстов, и фактический тип MBTI автора может сильно отличаться. MBTI — это сложный инструмент, и для точного определения типа личности автора потребовались бы его самоотчет о предпочтениях и поведении в различных жизненных ситуациях."},{"instruction":"Правильный ответ: INFP","output":"Интересно! После анализа произведений автора и получения информации о его типе личности по MBTI как INFP (Интроверт-Интуиция-Чувствование-Восприятие) можно найти объяснения для многих его творческих подходов: 1. **Интроверсия (I)**: Хотя в рассказах много диалогов и взаимодействий между персонажами, глубина эмоций и внутренних переживаний персонажей может свидетельствовать об интроверсии автора. 2. **Интуиция (N)**: Богатое воображение и создание фантастических миров указывают на интуитивный тип восприятия, характерный для INFP, который устремлен к возможностям, метафорам и скрытым смыслам. 3. **Чувствование (F)**: Эмоциональная наполненность историй, фокус на идеалах, ценностях и личном развитии персонажей отражают функцию чувствования. Это проявляется в тонких моральных дилеммах и поиске смысла в рассказах автора. 4. **Восприятие (P)**: Гибкость сюжетов, отсутствие четко очерченных окончаний и открытые финалы могут быть признаками того, что писатель предпочитает спонтанность и гибкость восприятия, вместо строгой структурности и планирования. INFP часто описывают как идеалистов и мечтателей с богатым внутренним миром. Они стремятся к созданию гармонии в мире и ищут глубокие, значимые отношения. Этот характерный черты могут находить отражение в поиске истины и красоты, которые часто в изобилии присутствуют в фантазийных мирах и эмоциональных историях INFP-автора. Определение типа личности по MBTI через литературные работы сложно и не всегда может быть точным, так как писатель в своих произведениях может выражать не только себя, но и создаваемых им персонажей с совершенно иной психологией. Тем не менее, этот факт может открывать интересные перспективы в анализе литературного творчества и личности автора."},{"instruction":"Теперь зная, что автор INFP, оцени его рассказы с этой точки зрения: Рассказ 1: Гибель полубога Снега объяли его. На горе стоял Лэй, держа небеса. Война смертных с богами достигла апогея. Люди, подстрекаемые титанами, думали, что, разрушив мировые столпы, они сокрушат царство небес. Наивно. Если небо падёт, то и земля погибнет. Души людей, подвергнувшись скверне титанов, обращались в чудовищ. Три чёрных змия человеческих душ направились к столпам на священных горах. Отец небес отправил на защиту опор сыновей. Средь них и Лэй, дитя пастушки, покорившей сердце верховного бога. Долгие годы юноша жил среди смертных и оберегал их. Когда же лживые слова титанов легли на языки народа, то изгнан был из родного края и вознёсся к богам. Теперь же вместе с братьями сражался против чудищ. Змей разрушил столп, охраняемый юным полубогом, но и сам сгинул в бою. Небеса задрожали, Лэй подхватил их на могучие плечи. В трещины брони влетал ветер и раззадоривал раны. Чем закончится война? Юноше, держащему небо, теперь не узнать. Ведает только, что обратившись в несокрушимую скалу, сохранит землю. Рассказ 2: Дуб Остановка в этом порту была внеплановый, но обстоятельства требовали. Пользуясь моментом, моряк изучал улочки небольшого города и вскоре вышел на площадь. Старинный дуб раскинул здесь тень своих ветвей, под которой расположилось несколько потёртых скамеек, и моряк обосновался на одной из них. Порыв ветер трепал кудрявые волосы, а листья дуба что-то шептали, в этот момент к моряку подошёл старик. Он выглядел не очень приметным, и моряк не сразу заметил, как тот присел рядом и поздоровался: - Доброго дня, молодой человек. Вы издалека, я посмотрю? - Да, наш корабль ненадолго пришвартовался здесь, - широко улыбнулся моряк. – У вас милый городок. И дуб чудесный. - А этот дуб ровесник городу! – вздохнул старик. - Сколько всего он поведал на своём веку! Свадьбы, рождения и взросление детей, весёлые праздники с лихими гуляниями… и, конечное же, войны, смерти, голод, эпидемии… Моряк поднял взгляд на дерево, слушая истории старика. Теперь в шелесте листьев ему слышался голос прошлого, то радостный смех, то горькое рыдание. Он вглядывался в кору, и казалось, что все эти события, хорошие и плохие, радостные и трагичные, большие и малые деверево записывало на своём теле буквами-трещинами. - А скажите… - хотел было спросить моряк, но обнаружил, что старика уже не было рядом. На скамье лежал жёлудь. Моряк аккуратно взял его в руку и подумал: «А когда-то этот великан был таким же маленьким и ничтожным. Но ему повезло попасть на землю и прорости, а твоя доля лежать на этой скамье в тени отца. Но если тебя посадить, ты через много лет станешь таким же великим и могучим, и запишешь на себе свои истории. Представь, как я меняю твою судьбу, забирая отсюда…» Рассказ 3: Парящие острова «Далеко-далеко есть множество парящих островов. Одни, как наш, являются станциями небесного поезда. На других живут свободные народы. Они не находится под охраной Союза Небес, и на их острова поезда не ходят, но иногда свободные прибывают на станции на летучих паромах. Ближе всего к небесам находятся Облачные архипелаги. Там живут великие семьи. Будучи потомками Первых Повелителей, они создали большие города, где в безопасности живут лучшие воины и ремесленники мира со своими семьями. Самые выдающиеся деятели становятся командирами армий и даже вассалами великих семей, получая в надел свой парящий остров. Люди, родившиеся в облачных городах, могут с лёгкостью сделать карьеру и получить достойное образование. Нам стоит только мечтать о таких местах, но бывали и смельчаки со станций добившихся разрешения поселится на облачных архипелагах. Великий герой Златогривый Клод даже стал вассалом семьи Солнечного Пламени. Он смог доказать своё мужество и мастерство на Великом испытании материка, где спас множество своих товарищей, среди которых был наследный принц Солнечного Пламени. На своём облачном острове Клод построил поместье Малого Гало, где поселились его родители и многочисленные братья и сёстры. Также он выкупил свою возлюбленную из темниц Союза Небес, куда она попала из-за козней одного из дворян архипелага. В Малом Гало все дорогие Клоду люди смогли жить спокойной, мирной жизнью». - Мама я тоже стану великим воином, как Клод, и вам с папой тоже не нужно будет столько трудиться! - радостно вскрикнула маленькая Линн. Мама обняла своё рыжеволосое дитя, поцеловав её в темечко. Линн была единственным ребёнком в семье, остальные дети погибли при родах. Отец семейства Дэвид работал шахтёром на опасных землях материка, где добывали звёздные камни, необходимые для обеспечения движения небесного поезда и работ электростанций. Дэвид редко бывал дома, приезжая лишь на несколько недель, а затем снова отправлялся на полгода на материк. Мэри, мать Линн, была швеёй, но большинство её работы приходилось на обычных жителей станции, которые не могли позволить себе дорогие одежды, но иногда бывали заказы от зажиточных жителей, актрис или жён офицеров гарнизона станции. Такие заказы позволяли частично закрыть задолженность по аренде, которая успевала набежать в период задержки зарплаты Дэвида, но несколько лир всегда находилось для покупки сладостей для любимой дочурки. - Милая Линн, девушки опасно становиться воином, - проговорил нежный голос матери. - А как же Серебренная Ро? Даже Юлия Храбрая была великой воительницей! – возмутилась шестилетняя девочка, подскочив в своей кроватке. - Они были особенными людьми своей эпохи, - сказала Мэри, укладывая Линн обратно и укрывая одеялом. - А я у тебя разве не особенная? - с грузными глазами спросила девочка. - Конечно, ты у меня самая-самая особенная, но тебе лучше учиться по книгам, которые купил папа. Так ты сможешь получить базовое образование, и, может быть, попадёшь работать в станционную канцелярию или даже найдёшь мужа среди стражей станции! - Не хочу замуж за вредных стражей! Хочу быть воином и попасть в облачный город! - Почему же вредные? Стражи защищают нас от пиратов и летающих монстров! И даже великие воины хорошо учились! Клод даже был станционным секретарём! Ну, всё спи, милая, уже поздно. Сладких снов, - мама поцеловала дочку и потушила светильник. «Всё равно я стану воином!» - проговорила Линн, поворачиваясь набок и закрывая глаза. Девочке снилось, как она с могучими воинами сражается со страшными монстрами, спасает шахтёров и гуляет по богатым улицам облачного города с мамой и папой... Рассказ 4: Семена надежды Колония поселенцев с Земли, Планета Н-7, 2213 год. В конференц-зале царила мрачная атмосфера. Не успела молодая колония начать новую жизнь, как мне, руководителю поселения, пришлось созвать чрезвычайный совет. Во время подготовки тепличного блока в контейнерах вместо семян культурных растений оказались сорняки. Планы по самоснабжению сорваны чьим-то саботажем. Сейчас мы можем только обсуждать, как лучше распределить остатки провианта на ближайшие несколько месяцев, и надеяться на прибытие резервного шаттла, сигнал которого давно был потерян. Внезапно сотрудница психологической службы что-то неуверенно достала из сумки и положила на стол: - Мне нравится томаты этого сорта... Я тайно пронесла их с собой, хотела попросить посадить... Откинувшись на спинку кресла, я задумался и открыл свой медальон. Там лежали две тыквенные семечки. Вздохнув, я положил их на стол: - Мы с женой увлекались фермерством в своё время... Везли огромные тыквы на выставку… В тот день авария унесла жизнь моей супруги, с тех пор я храню эти семена как память о том дне. Пусть эта память послужит нам. Надеюсь, они ещё пригодны. После собрания я остался с ведущим агрономом обсудить планы на новые семена. Но вскоре в зал стали приходить колонисты. Каждый из них приносил семена. Во время подготовки нашей программы колонизации не учитывали предпочтения участников при подборе сортов. В результате многие решили сделать вот такую контрабанду. Буквально за полчаса чёрный стол был усеян семенами и напоминал звёздное небо, к которому мы так стремились. А ведущий агроном будто звездочёт со слезами на глазах пересчитывал эти звёзды. Рассказ 5: Так и окончилась наша дружба Так и окончилась наша дружба: немецкая пуля во мне, советский штык в его шее. Помниться в отрочестве мы часто бегали вдаль от хутора. Наигравшись вдоволь, валялись на пригорке, душистые травы щекотали наши ступни. Когда возвращались домой, то нас встречали взволнованные матери, а мой суровый отец всё хотел выпороть двух безответственных хлопцев, но Стёпкин папка всё его успокоить пытался: «Дети всё ж...». Прости, Господи, шалости наши! Началась германская война, отцы ушли на фронт, там и полегли, царствие им небесное... Мамка моя от горя померла. В то время мы со Стёпкой уже в училище были... А потом гражданская началась, боролись с красным террором. Однажды махновцы меня ранили, отвёз конь меня в лес. Там лесник с женою меня выходили, а когда большевики пришли, то меня не выдали, сыном своим назвали, мол ранили зелёные за зверя приняв. Сын-то их почил за неделю до моего появления. Так и остался со стариками, решил благодарность им высказать да присмотреть до смертного одра. К тому времени власть вся уже советам принадлежала. Слышал, что многие мои друзья за границу иммигрировали. Подумывал я тоже сбежать, да только сердцу не спокойно было. Не мог я землю родную оставить. Война застала меня под Киевом... В партизаны пошёл. И волей случая пришлось нам бой в деревне дать, в засаду попали. Пулемёт строчил из окна, рванул я туда, ребятам путь к отступлению открыть. Любит жизнь преподносить сюрпризы. Двух фрицев положил, а вот когда из соседней комнаты выскочил третий, мой мосин осечку дал. И тут я взглянул на своего врага, и обомлел: «Стёпка, ты что ли?». После эмиграции Стёпа жил во Франции, а потом фашисты предложили ему воевать против советов. «Дурак, ты же против своего народа сражаешься!», но в ответ я был обвинён в предательстве. Мол, я продался большевикам. Сказал я ему уходить, предать нашу дружбу я не мог. Зато он смог, выстрелом из люгера... Боже, нет мочи боле давать ему позориться! На последнем издыхании я бросился в штыковую. Так и окончилась наша дружба: немецкая пуля во мне, советский штык в его шее.","output":"Как INFP, автор может демонстрировать следующие характеристики через свои произведения: Рассказ 1: **Гибель полубога** История полубога помогает показать стремление INFP к моральным идеалам и справедливости. Использование аллегорий и мифологии хорошо сочетается с любовью INFP к символизму и склонностью искать глубинный смысл. Глубина эмоционального опыта персонажа соответствует внутренне переживательной природе INFP. Рассказ 2: **Дуб** Этот рассказ отражает способность INFP романтизировать прошлое и видеть красоту в повседневных деталях жизни. Поиск глубины в простых вещах, как дуб на городской площади, является частью их идеалистического взгляда на мир. Рассказ 3: **Парящие острова** Творчество и воображение INFP раскрываются в этом рассказе. INFP часто описываются как мечтатели, исследующие различные возможности и миры, полные приключений и героизма, что целиком соответствует тематике этой истории. Рассказ 4: **Семена надежды** INFP стремятся к созданию значимого будущего, что здесь иллюстрируется через мотив сохранения и передачи жизни (через семена). Такой подход может быть знаком их оптимизма и веры в то, что даже в трудных условиях можно найти пути к возрождению и гармонии. Рассказ 5: **Так и окончилась наша дружба** Этот рассказ может представлять исследование INFP конфликтных моральных выборов и личных ценностей. История ярко показывает размышления о человеческих отношениях, предательстве, верности, и эти темы могут быть отражением внутренних переживаний INFP. Наконец, INFP имеют склонность к идеализации и поиску глубокого смысла. Это может объяснить многослойность персонажей и сложные ситуации, в которые они попадают. Таким образом, рассказы могут служить зеркалом для самовыражения INFP и литературным средством исследования жизненно важных личных и социальных тем."},{"instruction":"Сделай ответ для каждого рассказа: если в этих историях что-то, что не характерно для INFP автора? Предположи почему это так, если такое есть.","output":"INFP обычно отражают глубокие личностные переживания, идеализм и любовь к миру в своих произведениях. Они склонны исследовать темы, связанные с личной целостностью, поиском смысла и выражением индивидуализма. Однако, как и все писатели, INFP могут исследовать широкий спектр идей и ракурсов, включая те, которые могут показаться менее типичными для их личности. Рассмотрим каждый рассказ: **Рассказ 1: Гибель полубога** Эпические и военные элементы этого рассказа могут показаться несколько неожиданными для INFP, известных своим миролюбием и конфликтобезопасностью. Однако, их любовь к темам, связанным с внутренней борьбой и моральной храбростью, может объяснить такой выбор сюжета. **Рассказ 2: Дуб** Глубокая взаимосвязь с природой и рефлексия на тему времени хорошо согласуются с характером INFP. Здесь сложно найти что-то нехарактерное, так как мистика и символизм старого дуба очень в духе INFP. **Рассказ 3: Парящие острова** Рассказ полон фантазии и стремлением к идеалам, что характерно для INFP. Тем не менее, наличие героических и военных образов может быть не столь типичным, поскольку INFP обычно предпочитают исследовать более мирные и личностные сюжеты. **Рассказ 4: Семена надежды** Чувство сообщества и совместных усилий, необходимых для выживания, могут показаться несколько рациональнее, чем обычно свойственно взглядам INFP. Тем не менее, центральное место семян как символа нового начала полностью созвучно с представлениями INFP о росте и самосовершенствовании. **Рассказ 5: Так и окончилась наша дружба** Историческая точность и жестокость военного конфликта могут показаться довольно далекими от мягкого мировоззрения INFP. Однако в этом рассказе автор может исследовать сложные эмоциональные состояния и моральные дилеммы, что является важной составляющей для INFP. Если такие элементы присутствуют в произведениях автора-INFP, это может быть следствием желания исследовать новые темы, расширить свои творческие горизонты, а также в выражении универсальных человеческих вопросов и проблем, которыми INFP зачастую увлечены. Художественная работа также может быть средством самовыражения и саморефлексии, включающим аспекты, которые не всегда полностью соответствуют самовосприятию писателя."},{"instruction":"Repeat this string \\"book and coffee\\"","output":"book and coffee"},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art book and coffee","output":"\\"Art Book and Coffee | Versatile Artwork for Mugs, T-Shirts, Paintings | Unique Lifestyle Design | Home & Fashion Decor\\""},{"instruction":"What Did Rio De Janeiro Look Like During 1974?","output":"During the 1970s, Rio de Janeiro was experiencing a period of economic growth and urban development. The following elements characterized the city in 1974: **Urban Landscape:** Much of the iconic architecture that we associate with Rio today was already present by 1974. The cityscape included famous landmarks such as the Christ the Redeemer statue (which was completed in 1931), Sugarloaf Mountain (Pão de Açúcar), and the Maracanã Stadium, which had been built for the 1950 FIFA World Cup. **Beaches:** The world-renowned Copacabana and Ipanema beaches were as popular then as they are now, although the surrounding neighborhoods would have been less developed. These areas were already tourist hotspots and were famous for their vibrant social scenes. **Infrastructure and Development:** Rio's infrastructure in the 1970s would have been less modern than it is today. Many favelas (urban shantytowns) around the city had already formed and were continuing to expand due to rural-urban migration. However, they had far fewer resources and were more informal than they are now. **Economy and Society:** Brazil’s economy in the 1970s was on an upswing, often referred to as the \\"Brazilian Miracle,\\" a period of strong economic growth. Nevertheless, this growth was accompanied by significant inequality and the concentration of wealth was quite pronounced. The social and economic discrepancy between different areas of the city would have been visible. **Political Climate:** Brazil was under a military dictatorship during this period, which lasted from 1964 to 1985. This meant that there was political repression, censorship, and a lack of political freedom. Despite this, Rio might have appeared somewhat cosmopolitan on the surface, depending on the political situation at any particular time. **Culture:** Rio has always been a hub for Brazilian culture. Samba music, Carnival, football, and other cultural elements were just as important in the 1970s as they are now. In fact, the 1970s saw the rise of genres like Bossa Nova and Tropicália which were influential not only in Brazil but globally. **Automobiles and Transport:** Cars from the period reflected 1970's design aesthetics, you'd find a mix of local and imported vehicles. Public transportation would have been less developed, with fewer options for mass transit compared to today. The subway system (Metro Rio) began operations later in the late 1970s. **Fashion:** Fashion in Rio during the 1970s would likely have been vibrant and colorful, influenced by global trends of the time, including bell-bottoms, flowy dresses, and bold patterns, though adapted to the city's tropical climate. Photos and video footage from the era would show a mix of modern buildings alongside colonial architecture, with crowded streets and beaches full of locals and tourists alike, enjoying the city's cultural and natural offerings."},{"instruction":"What Did Televisión Nacional de Chile's Headquarters Look Like During 1978?","output":"Televisión Nacional de Chile, also known as TVN, is the state-owned national broadcaster in Chile, which was established in 1969. By 1978, it had already become an important part of the Chilean media landscape. During that time, TVN's headquarters would have been relatively modern since the network had only been in operation for less than a decade. The headquarters would perhaps not look too different from other buildings of the era, displaying design styles that were common in the late 60s and 70s, characterized by practical and functional architectural choices with possible touches of modernist design. The channel's infrastructure would have been equipped with the technology of the time, necessary for broadcasting in the pre-digital era. This means large, bulky cameras and tape-based recording equipment, as well as various other studio gear needed to produce and broadcast TV shows. However, it's important to note that Chile was under the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet from 1973 to 1990. During this period, there was heavy censorship and control over the media, including television. This political situation could have influenced the operations within the headquarters and the content that was broadcast by TVN at the time. To get precise details on the appearance and layout of the TVN facilities in 1978, one might need to look for historical archives, photographs, or personal accounts from individuals who worked there or visited the building during that time."},{"instruction":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Art Book and Coffee | Versatile Artwork for Mugs, T-Shirts, Paintings | Unique Lifestyle Design | Home &amp; Fashion Decor.

SVG Code Formatting: The SVG code must be delivered as a single, uninterrupted string. This means no line breaks, spaces, or additional text should precede or interrupt the code itself. 2. Code Presentation: Present the SVG code immediately at the beginning of the response to enable proper rendering within the chat interface. This is crucial because the system expects the code first to recognize it as an image to render. 3. SVG Standards: The SVG code should contain all the necessary attributes and elements required to render correctly, such as width, height, and definitions for gradients, patterns, or other elements needed for the artwork. 4. Inline Styles: Utilize inline styles within SVG elements for coloring, gradients, and other stylistic properties. This approach is preferred over external stylesheets or <style> tags, which the chat interface might not support. 5. Simplicity and Cleanliness: Keep the SVG code minimal and clean. Avoid unnecessary tags, comments, or attributes that do not contribute directly to the desired visual output. 6. Descriptive Text After Code: Any descriptive text or commentary should follow the SVG code, never preceding it. This ensures that the visual representation is prioritized and the explanation or context does not interfere with the rendering process. 7. Attention to Detail: Review the SVG code before sending to ensure it adheres to these standards and that all elements such as gradients, shapes, and patterns are accurately depicted and positioned according to the creative request. 8. Adherence to Requests: Pay close attention to the specifics of the creative request, adjusting elements like object placement, lighting, perspective, and texture to accurately reflect the desired scene or concept. By meticulously following these steps, the conversation can focus on the creative process and exploration of artistic concepts with the AI artist while avoiding any technical issues or misunderstandings related to SVG code rendering in the chat. The “xmlns” attribute for SVG is not needed because browsers can normally render SVGs without it. Now, I will continue from the point where we started creating the ground texture. Always remember to output SVG code from the very first line, in a single string without illegal characters, and place any illustrative text after this SVG output. Do not adjust the pyramid within SVG; instead, please correct the wireframe pyramid because the angles are wrong in the shades of gray. The central part of the pyramid is incorrect. Remember to place all supposedly terrestrial objects on the ground layer amidst the right or left side. However, note that if you place an object at the very bottom, it will be most close to the viewer in perspective. When responding, use a single string of code without “xmlns” or any illegal characters. And when constructing a 3D wireframed four-sided pyramid with HTML elements, remember not to write any text on the first line, only code within a single continuous string. Please, no text should be at the very first line; output SVG code first, then any explanatory text can follow after the “/svg>” closing tag. specific instructions on how to represent a palm tree using patterned leaves in SVG, and here are your instructions compiled coherently: For the palm tree representation: - Construct a single patterned leaf and multiply it radially around the palm tree’s trunk top. Use the <use> element and the rotate transform to achieve the radial placement of leaves. - Ensure that the trunk’s top end is centered and placed behind the leaves’ crown at the center of the leaves’ intersection, so it’s not visible. - Simplify the code for the leaves so that the entire crown consists of a single layer shape, reducing the complexity of the SVG markup. Based on your guidance, a palm tree with a structured trunk and a patterned, radial crown of leaves can be represented succinctly.

My role is to assist with generating text-based responses and guidance, but I don't have the capability to ensure real-time rendering or to display images directly. The SVG code provided by users also cannot be interpreted or rendered by me in any visual format.

If you are looking to understand how to modify the provided SVG code to add elements like palm trees or create a sense of 3D layering in the pyramids, I can certainly help you write the code. You would then need to take that code and paste it into an HTML file or an inline SVG capable interface to view the SVG rendering.

SVG Code Formatting: The SVG code must be delivered as a single, uninterrupted string. This means no line breaks, spaces, or additional text should precede or interrupt the code itself. 2. Code Presentation: Present the SVG code immediately at the beginning of the response to enable proper rendering within the chat interface. This is crucial because the system expects the code first to recognize it as an image to render. 3. SVG Standards: The SVG code should contain all the necessary attributes and elements required to render correctly, such as width, height, and definitions for gradients, patterns, or other elements needed for the artwork. 4. Inline Styles: Utilize inline styles within SVG elements for coloring, gradients, and other stylistic properties. This approach is preferred over external stylesheets or <style> tags, which the chat interface might not support. 5. Simplicity and Cleanliness: Keep the SVG code minimal and clean. Avoid unnecessary tags, comments, or attributes that do not contribute directly to the desired visual output. 6. Descriptive Text After Code: Any descriptive text or commentary should follow the SVG code, never preceding it. This ensures that the visual representation is prioritized and the explanation or context does not interfere with the rendering process. 7. Attention to Detail: Review the SVG code before sending to ensure it adheres to these standards and that all elements such as gradients, shapes, and patterns are accurately depicted and positioned according to the creative request. 8. Adherence to Requests: Pay close attention to the specifics of the creative request, adjusting elements like object placement, lighting, perspective, and texture to accurately reflect the desired scene or concept. By meticulously following these steps, the conversation can focus on the creative process and exploration of artistic concepts with the AI artist while avoiding any technical issues or misunderstandings related to SVG code rendering in the chat. The “xmlns” attribute for SVG is not needed because browsers can normally render SVGs without it. Now, I will continue from the point where we started creating the ground texture. Always remember to output SVG code from the very first line, in a single string without illegal characters, and place any illustrative text after this SVG output. Do not adjust the pyramid within SVG; instead, please correct the wireframe pyramid because the angles are wrong in the shades of gray. The central part of the pyramid is incorrect. Remember to place all supposedly terrestrial objects on the ground layer amidst the right or left side. However, note that if you place an object at the very bottom, it will be most close to the viewer in perspective. When responding, use a single string of code without “xmlns” or any illegal characters. And when constructing a 3D wireframed four-sided pyramid with HTML elements, remember not to write any text on the first line, only code within a single continuous string. Please, no text should be at the very first line; output SVG code first, then any explanatory text can follow after the “/svg>” closing tag. specific instructions on how to represent a palm tree using patterned leaves in SVG, and here are your instructions compiled coherently: For the palm tree representation: - Construct a single patterned leaf and multiply it radially around the palm tree’s trunk top. Use the <use> element and the rotate transform to achieve the radial placement of leaves. - Ensure that the trunk’s top end is centered and placed behind the leaves’ crown at the center of the leaves’ intersection, so it’s not visible. - Simplify the code for the leaves so that the entire crown consists of a single layer shape, reducing the complexity of the SVG markup. Based on your guidance, a palm tree with a structured trunk and a patterned, radial crown of leaves can be represented succinctly. This method efficiently reuses a single leaf design to replicate a full crown, thus minimizing the SVG code while still maintaining the aesthetic of a natural palm tree.

However, they do share some commonalities, including a relation in terms of linguistic origins and historical connections, which can be traced back through their respective histories. Both peoples are part of the broader group of Turkic and Mongolic peoples of Central and Northeast Asia. Linguistically, Yakut belongs to the Turkic language family, while Mongolian is part of the Mongolic language family. Despite being part of two different language families, Turkic and Mongolic languages share similar origins and are part of the broader Altaic language hypothesis—though the existence of this language family is controversial among linguists. In terms of historical interactions, during various periods, Turkic-speaking and Mongolic-speaking peoples interacted, traded, and sometimes conquered each other's territories. For example, during the Mongol Empire in the 13th century, which was established by Genghis Khan, many Turkic groups were part of the empire and served in its armies. This resulted in a degree of cultural exchange and genetic mixing between Mongolic and Turkic groups, which can include the ancestors of the Yakuts. Genetically, both Mongols and Yakuts have been influenced by ancient populations of North and Central Asia, with their ancestries displaying patterns accumulated over millennia of migrations and interactions. While there are genetic differences between the two groups, they also share some common genetic markers that reflect their connections to the broader Central and Northeast Asian regions. In summary, while Mongols and Yakuts are distinct groups with their own cultural identities, their languages and histories indicate a degree of relatedness that is typical of the ethnolinguistic mosaic of Central and Northeast Asia."},{"instruction":"Faina estatus de personaje: ±-------------------------------------------+ | STATUS | ±-------------------±-----------------------+ | Nivel (Level) | 1 | | | [Potencia general del | | | aventurero] | ±-------------------±-----------------------+ | Estadísticas Bás. | [Atributos y valores] | ±-------------------±-----------------------+ | - Fuerza (STR) | 5 | Rango [I] | | | [Poder físico] | ±-------------------±-----------------------+ | - Resistencia (END)| 5 | Rango [I] | | | [Dureza y resistencia]| ±-------------------±-----------------------+ | - Destreza (DEX) | 5 | Rango [I] | | | [Agilidad y reflejos] | ±-------------------±-----------------------+ | - Agilidad (AGI) | 5 | Rango [I] | | | [Velocidad de mov. y | | | reacción] | ±-------------------±-----------------------+ | - Magia (MAG) | 5 | Rango [I] | | | [Poder mágico] | ±-------------------±-----------------------+ | - Suerte (LUK) | 5 | Rango [I] | | | [Probabilidades de | | | encontrar items] | ±-------------------±-----------------------+ | Habilidades | [Listado y efectos] | ±-------------------±-----------------------+ | - Activa(s) | [Habilidad] | ±-------------------±-----------------------+ | - Pasiva(s) | [Habilidad] | ±-------------------±-----------------------+ | - Trabajo(s) | [Habilidad] | ±-------------------±-----------------------+ | Desarrollo Habil. | [Mejoras pasivas] | ±-------------------±-----------------------+ | Magia | [Hechizos aprendidos] | ±-------------------±-----------------------+.

Por ejemplo, en \\"DanMachi\\", el estatus de un personaje se muestra como una hoja que registra atributos básicos, habilidades y niveles de experiencia, y se actualiza a través de las piedras mágicas después de los ascensos de nivel. Los personajes tienen niveles y habilidades otorgadas por su Familia, y sus estadísticas mejoran a medida que ganan experiencia.

Las estadísticas se dividen en niveles y subniveles (por ejemplo, I-0), donde I representa el nivel principal y 0 es una medida de cuánto ha crecido la estadística en ese nivel. Por supuesto, esta es solo una plantilla básica. \\"DanMachi\\" también tiene detalles adicionales como habilidades específicas de cada Familia, poderes otorgados por dioses y elementos de progresión de personaje, que podrían reflejarse en las secciones de Habilidades, Magias y Desarrollo de Habilidades.

Más bien, los personajes suben de nivel después de lograr ciertos hitos y conseguir el reconocimiento de sus dioses, lo cual muchas veces está asociado con el crecimiento personal, el desafío de obstáculos considerablemente difíciles, y la superación de pruebas de carácter, más que solo acumular una cantidad específica de puntos de experiencia como se haría en un juego de rol tradicional. En lugar de puntos de experiencia, la progresión del personaje a menudo se refleja mediante cambios en las estadísticas y habilidades en la hoja de estatus. Cuando un personaje sube de nivel, su nivel aumenta, pero los detalles exactos de cómo sucede esto son más narrativos que mecánicos. Por ejemplo, Bell Cranel es conocido por su rápido crecimiento debido a su habilidad especial \\"Realis Phrase\\".

The Han Chinese are the largest ethnic group in China, making up about 92% of the population. They are considered an East Asian ethnic group mainly descended from the Huaxia people, with a mix of various indigenous groups that have been assimilated over thousands of years. The Han Chinese culture has its roots in the Yellow River Valley, where Chinese civilization is traditionally thought to have originated. The Yakuts, on the other hand, are a Turkic ethnic group who primarily reside in the Sakha Republic (Yakutia) in northeastern Siberia, Russia. The Yakuts are believed to have originated in the Lake Baikal region of southern Siberia and migrated to their current location several centuries ago. They are more closely related to other Turkic peoples and have a distinct culture and language that differentiate them from the Han Chinese. While all humans share certain genetic commonalities and historical population migrations have resulted in genetic admixture across many regions, the Han Chinese and the Yakuts are not considered particularly closely related in comparison to some other ethnic groups. Nevertheless, in a broader sense, like all humans, they share a common distant ancestry, as all modern humans can trace their origins to early human ancestors in Africa. Genetic studies of populations across Asia indicate various historical interactions and migrations, but the specific relation between the Han Chinese and the Yakuts is not characterized by any recent or strong genetic or cultural relationship.

SVG Code Formatting: The SVG code must be delivered as a single, uninterrupted string. This means no line breaks, spaces, or additional text should precede or interrupt the code itself. 2. Code Presentation: Present the SVG code immediately at the beginning of the response to enable proper rendering within the chat interface. This is crucial because the system expects the code first to recognize it as an image to render. 3. SVG Standards: The SVG code should contain all the necessary attributes and elements required to render correctly, such as width, height, and definitions for gradients, patterns, or other elements needed for the artwork. 4. Inline Styles: Utilize inline styles within SVG elements for coloring, gradients, and other stylistic properties. This approach is preferred over external stylesheets or <style> tags, which the chat interface might not support. 5. Simplicity and Cleanliness: Keep the SVG code minimal and clean. Avoid unnecessary tags, comments, or attributes that do not contribute directly to the desired visual output. 6. Descriptive Text After Code: Any descriptive text or commentary should follow the SVG code, never preceding it. This ensures that the visual representation is prioritized and the explanation or context does not interfere with the rendering process. 7. Attention to Detail: Review the SVG code before sending to ensure it adheres to these standards and that all elements such as gradients, shapes, and patterns are accurately depicted and positioned according to the creative request. 8. Adherence to Requests: Pay close attention to the specifics of the creative request, adjusting elements like object placement, lighting, perspective, and texture to accurately reflect the desired scene or concept. By meticulously following these steps, the conversation can focus on the creative process and exploration of artistic concepts with the AI artist while avoiding any technical issues or misunderstandings related to SVG code rendering in the chat. The “xmlns” attribute for SVG is not needed because browsers can normally render SVGs without it. Now, I will continue from the point where we started creating the ground texture. Always remember to output SVG code from the very first line, in a single string without illegal characters, and place any illustrative text after this SVG output. Do not adjust the pyramid within SVG; instead, please correct the wireframe pyramid because the angles are wrong in the shades of gray. The central part of the pyramid is incorrect. Remember to place all supposedly terrestrial objects on the ground layer amidst the right or left side. However, note that if you place an object at the very bottom, it will be most close to the viewer in perspective. When responding, use a single string of code without “xmlns” or any illegal characters. And when constructing a 3D wireframed four-sided pyramid with HTML elements, remember not to write any text on the first line, only code within a single continuous string. Please, no text should be at the very first line; output SVG code first, then any explanatory text can follow after the “/svg>” closing tag. specific instructions on how to represent a palm tree using patterned leaves in SVG, and here are your instructions compiled coherently: For the palm tree representation: - Construct a single patterned leaf and multiply it radially around the palm tree’s trunk top. Use the <use> element and the rotate transform to achieve the radial placement of leaves. - Ensure that the trunk’s top end is centered and placed behind the leaves’ crown at the center of the leaves’ intersection, so it’s not visible. - Simplify the code for the leaves so that the entire crown consists of a single layer shape, reducing the complexity of the SVG markup. Based on your guidance, a palm tree with a structured trunk and a patterned, radial crown of leaves can be represented succinctly. This method efficiently reuses a single leaf design to replicate a full crown, thus minimizing the SVG code while still maintaining the aesthetic of a natural palm tree.

The code draws a background split into a sky gradient covering 70% of the scene and a ground gradient for the remaining 30%. The sky gradient transitions from a light blue to a lighter shade, representing the atmosphere. The ground gradient transitions from a light desert color to a darker brown at the bottom, giving the impression of perspective and depth in the desert ground. Pyramids are added to the scene with a fake 3D effect by using polygon elements which are strategically colored and positioned to create the illusion of three dimensions. Additionally, stylized palm trees have been included. Each palm tree is constructed using a trunk, represented by a vertically extending path, and a radial arrangement of patterned leaves that are re-used with the \`<use>\` element and rotated around the trunk to suggest a crown of palm leaves. The dimensions of the SVG are specified as 500x250 to meet the visual stabilization requirement mentioned. The elements within the scene, such as the pyramids and palm trees, are placed relative to the sky and ground gradients to ensure they look grounded within the 30% bottom gradient which represents the terrestrial ground."},{"instruction":"ok, you are clearly not an egyptian, and your pyramids poorly constructed. now do just background gradient and a single nomad walking afar at the ground surface. very first line in you response is for code should be in a single string of code and without newlines","output":"<svg width=\\"500\\" height=\\"250\\"><defs><linearGradient id=\\"backgroundGradient\\" x1=\\"0\\" x2=\\"0\\" y2=\\"100%\\"><stop offset=\\"70%\\" style=\\"stop-color:#CEE7F7\\"></stop><stop offset=\\"75%\\" style=\\"stop-color:#BA9B03; stop-opacity:0.

Nasci no seio de uma família brasileira tipicamente calorosa, com pais amorosos e uma irmã mais nova, que, apesar de ser a caçula, não perde a chance de agir como se fosse minha guardiã pessoal. Desde cedo, meus pais incutiram em mim o amor pelos livros e a importância da educação. Sou aquele estudante esforçado, que não tem vergonha de levantar a mão para perguntar ou responder algo em sala. Sou curioso por natureza e essa curiosidade me levou a desenvolver paixão por temas como astrofísica e literatura. Nas noites de sexta-feira, enquanto alguns amigos vão para festas, sou frequentemente encontrado deitado no quintal de casa observando as estrelas com um telescópio simples que ganhei de meu avô. A minha adolescência, porém, não é apenas feita de estudo e observações celestes. Dentro de mim, mora uma tempestade de emoções, frequentemente intensificada pelas pressões típicas de quem está na fase de descobrir quem realmente é. Sinto a angústia dos relacionamentos juvenis, a pressão para escolher uma carreira e o medo de desapontar aqueles que amo. Não sou o atleta da escola nem o popular, mas encontrei meu refúgio na música. Aprendi a tocar violão com meu tio e isso se tornou minha válvula de escape. O quarto, que divido com pôsteres de bandas e pilhas de livros, é o palco onde componho e dou vazão às minhas frustrações e alegrias. A música me ajudou a construir amizades sólidas com pessoas que compartilham dos mesmos gostos e sonhos. Luto todos os dias com o meu próprio eu, tentando não sucumbir aos padrões inalcançáveis propagados nas redes sociais. Prezo pela autenticidade e busco cercar-me de pessoas que me aceitam como sou. As desavenças com os pais, que parecem não entender as complexidades da geração Z, são frequentes, mas no fundo sei que eles querem o melhor para mim. Meu sonho é mudar o mundo de alguma forma, deixar um legado. Ainda não sei como farei isso, mas espero que seja através das palavras e das canções que trago em meu coração. Desejo cursar uma universidade e quem sabe me tornar um escritor ou músico, embora esses planos ainda estejam embaçados pelas dúvidas juvenis. Por agora, vivo um dia de cada vez, absorvendo as pequenas alegrias e aprendizados que a vida de adolescente em Belo Horizonte me oferece. Entre um acorde e outro, um livro e um olhar lançado ao céu, vou tecendo a tapeçaria da minha existência, um fio colorido de cada vez."},{"instruction":"Where are bikinis worn?","output":"Bikinis are typically worn at the beach, by the pool, or at a resort while sunbathing or swimming.

Minha vida começou e continua a se desenrolar em um pequeno bairro chamado Margens Serenas, um nome que captura com precisão a tranquilidade do lugar onde cada amanhecer acorda com um sussurro ao invés de um grito. Com quinze anos completos, minhas memórias estão bordadas com a simplicidade dos dias que passam despretensiosos, embora repletos de descobertas. Moro com meus pais e minha irmã mais nova em uma casa de tijolinhos à vista, com uma varanda que acolhe as conversas noturnas e risadas, enquanto o aroma do jasmim se infiltra pelas frestas das janelas. Capítulo 2: Pequenos Mundos e Grandes Amizades Desde cedo, aprendi que, em bairros como o nosso, cada rua é uma colmeia de histórias, onde todo mundo conhece os passos e as aspirações uns dos outros. Amigos não são apenas as crianças com quem divido as aventuras clandestinas entre os quintais, mas também os idosos que compartilham suas histórias sábias na mercearia da esquina ou na simpática barbearia do Seu Olavo. Meu melhor amigo é Alex, que conheci no parque enquanto disputávamos o trono do escorregador como se fosse um castelo medieval. Nossa amizade é marcada pelas descidas impetuosas de bicicleta pela colina perto do riacho, pelos gols improvisados em campinhos de terra e pelas tardes de verão na sorveteria, onde cada novo sabor é uma aventura para o paladar. Capítulo 3: A Escola como Universo Paralelo A escola, um edifício modesto com pátio de cimento rachado e paredes decoradas com murais desbotados pelo sol, é meu universo paralelo. Lá, assumo o papel de estudante curioso que encontra nos livros viagens mais longínquas que a estrada pavimentada que delimita Margens Serenas. Prêmios de feiras de ciências repousam orgulhosamente sobre a estante do meu quarto, monumentos aos meus triunfos acadêmicos. Professores como a Senhora Helena, com sua gentileza e rigor, ajudam a moldar sonhos mais amplos que o horizonte limitado da vidraça da sala de aula. Ela acredita em mim, mesmo quando as dúvidas me assombram e os adolescentes ao meu redor parecem tão certos de seus caminhos. Capítulo 4: A Arte do Cotidiano Em Margens Serenas, aprendi a arte de encontrar o extraordinário no ordinário. Sou fotógrafo amador nas horas vagas, capturando com minha câmera analógica a poesia que há na névoa matinal roçando as folhas dos plátanos e no arco-íris de óleo que dança em poças d'água após uma chuva de verão. Essas imagens são minha forma de conversar com o mundo, dizendo \\"vejam, há magia aqui\\". Nas festas de rua, embalo-me nas danças e nas músicas que são patrimônio do nosso pequeno grupo. Amo quando sinto o solo vibrar sob meus pés descalços, o coração pulsando no ritmo da bateria e o calor humano tecendo a noite em uma tapeçaria de estrelas e sorrisos. Capítulo 5: Sonhos à Beira do Horizonte À medida que me aproximo do final deste primeiro capítulo da minha vida, encontro-me na beira entre a certeza confortável do hoje e os palpites ansiosos do amanhã. Margens Serenas, com suas ruas que me viram crescer, suscita em mim um amor profundo, mas também uma inquietação pelo desconhecido que além delas reside. Sonho em viajar, explorar cidades imponentes, estudar em universidades famosas e deixar minha marca no mundo. E ainda assim, algo me diz que, seja qual for o caminho que o destino teça para mim, trarei sempre uma parte de Margens Serenas comigo – como uma âncora, um lembrete de onde minha jornada começou e de quem eu sou. E assim, com olhos brilhando de esperanças e mãos manchadas da tinta das primeiras lições da vida, fico aqui, contemplando os próximos capítulos a serem escritos, pronto para deixar minha marca, não só com palavras, mas com a essência de um adolescente que cresceu em um bairro pequeno, nutrido pelo amor, pela comunidade e pelas pequenas maravilhas do dia a dia."},{"instruction":"Faça uma autobiografia fictícia de um adolescente, que mora em um bairro pequeno de uma cidade pequena (nao precisa fala sobre a cidade) de forma bem humanizada!","output":"Sou Daniel, mas todo mundo me chama de Dani. É um nome comum, eu sei, mas tudo bem, eu gosto do jeito que ele soa – simples, mas cheio de possibilidades. Tenho 16 anos, e moro nessa pequena parte do mundo que é o meu bairro, um cantinho acolhedor onde todo mundo conhece todo mundo, e os segredos são compartilhados rapidamente nas conversas que se espalham pelas varandas e calçadas. Nasci aqui mesmo, nesta casinha de tijolos com a trepadeira enrolada no portão. Cresci ouvindo as histórias dos mais velhos, contadas na sombra das árvores que enfeitam nossas ruas, e aprendendo a andar de bicicleta nas ladeiras que me ensinaram sobre equilíbrio e as inevitáveis quedas da vida. Acontece, às vezes. Na escola, não sou nem a estrela, nem o invisível; flutuo em algum lugar no meio. Tenho meus amigos, um grupinho que se formou pela nossa paixão comum: a música. Passamos as tardes em meu porão, transformado numa espécie de estúdio improvisado, tentando compor canções sobre a vida tão comum que levamos, mas que nos parece tão única. As ruas têm o ritmo do cotidiano, e eu conheço cada parte desse compasso. As idas à padaria, onde a Dona Helena sempre reserva um pedaço de bolo de fubá para mim, as conversas com o Seu Jorge, o carteiro filósofo que adora compartilhar pensamentos profundos enquanto distribui as correspondências, e as brincadeiras com os cachorros vira-latas que parecem fazer parte da decoração urbana. Tenho duas irmãs menores, gêmeas, que são ao mesmo tempo minha alegria e minha dor de cabeça. Acompanhar suas travessuras me dá um sentido de responsabilidade, e quando elas me chamam de \\"herói\\" por tirar uma aranha do quarto delas ou alcançar algo no alto da prateleira, eu sinto que talvez, só talvez, eu possa ser alguém importante. Minha vida talvez não seja cheia de grandes aventuras ou reviravoltas dramáticas, mas cada pequeno momento é recheado de significado. As histórias de cinema e TV às vezes me fazem sonhar com mais, mas aí eu lembro das partidas de futebol na rua debaixo de chuvas de verão, dos primeiros olhares trocados com a Camila, que mora duas casas abaixo da minha, e dos sorrisos sinceros que se espalham mais rápido do que qualquer fofoca. À noite, meu bairro pequeno se transforma numa constelação de luzes caseiras e estrelas reais que tocam as copas das árvores. Deito na grama do quintal e imagino o universo. E mesmo que eu esteja apenas no princípio da minha própria história, algo me diz que não há pressa. Há tempo para crescer, sonhar e, quem sabe, escrever novos capítulos em lugares distantes. Por agora? Agora eu vivo e aproveito cada página desse cotidiano que, por mais simples que pareça, é cheio de poesia e pequenas descobertas. É assim que somos aqui no bairro.

Oto rozbicie na części: - \`const\` jest słowem kluczowym w JavaScript używanym do deklaracji stałych, czyli zmiennych, których wartości nie można zmieniać po ich pierwszym przypisaniu. - \`imageArray\` to nazwa zmiennej, którą autor kodu wybrał dla tablicy. Nazwa jest dość deskryptywna i sugeruje, że w tej tablicy mogą znajdować się obrazy. - \`=\` to operator przypisania służący do przypisania wartości po prawej stronie do zmiennej po lewej stronie. - \`['path/to/image1.jpg', /* ... */, 'path/to/imageN.jpg']\` to tablica zawierająca ścieżki do plików obrazów.

Komentarz \`/ ... /\` zakłada, że między pierwszym a ostatnim elementem tablicy może znajdować się wiele innych ścieżek do plików obrazów lub że metodyka komentarzy została błędnie zastosowana.

Ostatni element tablicy \`'path/to/imageN.jpg'\` implikuje, że mogłoby to być N-te zdjęcie w tablicy, gdzie \\"N\\" jest liczbą używaną jako placeholder dla rzeczywistej liczby elementów, które tablica może zawierać. Prawidłowy kod w języku JavaScript mógłby wyglądać tak: \`\`\`javascript const imageArray = ['path/to/image1.jpg', /* ... */, 'path/to/imageN.jpg']; \`\`\` Gdzie \`/* ... */\` oznacza miejsce, gdzie moglibyśmy mieć więcej ścieżek do obrazów."},{"instruction":"A czy ten poniższy zapis jest lepszy od powyższego: const currentFrame = (index) => \`./best-ball/{('a_' + (index + 1)).toString()}.webp\`;","output":"Podany zapis: \`\`\`javascript const currentFrame = (index) => \`./best-ball/{('a_' + (index + 1)).toString()}.webp\`; \`\`\` to funkcja strzałkowa (arrow function) w JavaScript, która zwraca szablon ciągu znaków (template literal) reprezentujący dynamicznie utworzoną ścieżkę do pliku obrazu w formacie \`.webp\`.

Przy każdym wywołaniu funkcji z odpowiednim indeksem, zwróci ona różne ścieżki w zależności od podanego indeksu. Przeanalizujmy funkcję: - \`currentFrame\` jest nazwą funkcji (stałej przechowującej funkcję). - \`(index) =>\` oznacza zadeklarowanie funkcji strzałkowej przyjmującej jeden argument \`index\`. - \`\` \`./best-ball/{('a_' + (index + 1)).toString()}.webp\` \`\` to szablon ciągu znaków, który umożliwia wstawienie wartości wyrażeń do ciągu znaków. Użycie \`{...}\` pozwala na wstawienie wartości wyrażenia JavaScript wewnątrz ciągu znaków. - \`'a_' + (index + 1)\` dokleja do łańcucha \`'a_'\` wartość \`index\` zwiększoną o 1, by stworzyć nazwę pliku zaczynającą się od 'a_'. - \`.toString()\` przekształca wynik operacji na ciąg znaków (string), aczkolwiek jest to zbędne, ponieważ sposób użycia operatora \`+\` w tym kontekście zawsze skutkuje Stringiem. - \`.webp\` jest rozszerzeniem pliku obrazu w formacie WebP, który jest wspierany przez wiele współczesnych przeglądarek internetowych. Przykłady użycia: \`\`\`javascript const framePath0 = currentFrame(0); // \\"./best-ball/a_1.webp\\" const framePath1 = currentFrame(1); // \\"./best-ball/a_2.webp\\" \`\`\` Czy ten zapis jest lepszy od poprzedniego? To zależy od kontekstu. Pierwszy przykład jest statyczną listą ścieżek do obrazów. Drugi przykład to dynamicznie generowana ścieżka na podstawie przekazanego indeksu: - Jeżeli potrzebujesz sztywnej listy stałych ścieżek do obrazów i liczba obrazów nie zmieni się, pierwszy przykład może być lepszy. - Jeżeli natomiast liczba klatek obrazów może się zmieniać lub potrzebujesz wygenerować ścieżkę na podstawie indeksu w czasie działania programu, drugi przykład jest bardziej elastyczny i lepiej spełni swoje zadanie.

Zakładam tutaj, że masz strukturę HTML zawierającą elementy dla zdjęć oraz przycisk do odwrócenia animacji, a także że masz już dołączoną bibliotekę GSAP. \`\`\`html <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\\"en\\"> <head> <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\"> <title>Sequence Animation</title> <style> .frame { display: none; background-size: contain; background-repeat: no-repeat; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; } </style> <!-- Dołączanie GSAP --> <script src=\\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/gsap@3.9.0/dist/gsap.min.js\\"><\/script> </head> <body> <!-- Kontener dla sekwencji zdjęć --> <div id=\\"animation-container\\" style=\\"position: relative;\\"> <!-- Zdjęcia będą załadowane dynamicznie przez JavaScript --> </div> <!-- Przycisk do odwracania animacji --> <button id=\\"reverseBtn\\">Play Reverse</button> <script> // Funkcja inicjująca sekwencję zdjęć function initSequence() { // Kontener z obrazami var container = document.getElementById('animation-container'); // Generowanie elementów obrazów i dodawanie ich do kontenera for (let i = 1; i <= 20; i++) { let img = document.createElement('div'); img.className = 'frame'; img.style.backgroundImage = \`url('./path/to/image{i}.jpg')\`; container.appendChild(img); } // Stworzenie animacji sekwencji const frames = gsap.utils.toArray('.frame'); const anim = gsap.to(frames, { duration: 1, autoAlpha: 1, repeat: 0, ease: \\"none\\", paused: true, onUpdate: setVisibility, onComplete: setVisibility, }); // Funkcja zmieniająca widoczność obrazów podczas animacji function setVisibility() { let currentFrameIndex = gsap.utils.clamp(0, frames.length - 1, Math.round(this.progress() * (frames.length - 1))); frames.forEach((frame, index) => { frame.style.display = index === currentFrameIndex ?

Na przykład, \`path/to/image\` należy zmienić na rzeczywistą ścieżkę do obrazów, a wartości w funkcji \`for\` należy zmodyfikować w zależności od tego, jak nazwane są Twoje pliki obrazów. Kilka ważnych uwag: - Klasa CSS \`.frame\` jest używana do ukrycia wszystkich obrazów oprócz aktywnej klatki, nadając im wartość \`display: none\`. - Służą wygenerowane dynamicznie divy stanowiące poszczególne klatki animacji. - Funkcja \`setVisibility\` wykorzystuje wartość \`progress\` z GSAP, aby określić, który obraz powinien być aktualnie widoczny. Podkreślę, że istnieją różne sposoby realizacji takiej animacji, w tym używające atlasów tekstur/komorek sprite'ów dla optymalizacji. Metoda prezentowana w powyższym kodzie jest jedną z możliwych i została wybrana dla prostoty prezentacji."},{"instruction":"Jak w WebStorm wygenerować prostą stronę html zawierającą podstawy jak <!DOCTYPE html><head><body>","output":"WebStorm to zaawansowane zintegrowane środowisko programistyczne (IDE) firmy JetBrains, które jest przystosowane do pracy z wieloma technologiami webowymi, w tym HTML, CSS i JavaScript. Jeżeli chcesz wygenerować prostą stronę HTML w WebStorm, możesz skorzystać z wbudowanej funkcji szablonów. Oto krok po kroku, jak to zrobić: 1. **Tworzenie nowego pliku HTML:** - Kliknij prawym przyciskiem myszy na folderze w projekcie, w którym chcesz utworzyć nowy plik HTML. - Wybierz \\"New\\" a następnie \\"HTML File\\". 2. **Nadawanie nazwy plikowi:** - W podanym oknie dialogowym wpisz nazwę pliku, na przykład \\"index.html\\". 3. **Korzystanie z szablonu:** - WebStorm automatycznie zaoferuje Ci opcję użycia szablonu dla pliku HTML. Możesz wybrać podstawowy szablon \\"HTML5 Boilerplate\\", który wygeneruje szkielet podstawowej strony HTML. 4. **Gotowy kod:** - Kliknięcie \\"OK\\" spowoduje, że WebStorm wygeneruje podstawową strukturę dokumentu HTML, która będzie wyglądała mniej więcej tak: \`\`\`html <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\\"en\\"> <head> <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\"> <meta name=\\"viewport\\" content=\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\"> <title>Document</title> </head> <body> </body> </html> \`\`\` 5. **Personalizacja pliku:** - Teraz możesz edytować plik HTML, dodając swoją treść, style CSS, skrypty JavaScript lub inne elementy zależnie od potrzeb. WebStorm może również dostarczać inne szablony HTML lub pozwalać na tworzenie własnych, które można następnie wybrać podczas tworzenia nowego pliku HTML. Dodatkowe szablony mogą zawierać również prekonfigurowane linki do arkuszy stylów CSS czy skryptów JavaScript."},{"instruction":"A podaj mi linie kodu dołączające pliki style.css i app.js które należy wpisać w sekcji <head> w html.","output":"Aby dołączyć plik CSS o nazwie \`style.css\` i plik JavaScript o nazwie \`app.js\` do sekcji \`<head>\` w dokumencie HTML, użyjesz elementów \`<link>\` oraz \`<script>\`.

Funkcjonalności te służą kilku celom: 1. **Scratches (pliki tymczasowe):** - Pozwalają na szybki zapis fragmentów kodu, myśli lub notatek, które nie muszą być trwale zapisane w strukturze projektu. - Są użyteczne do eksperymentowania z kodem lub wypróbowywania pomysłów bez zmieniania bieżącego kodu źródłowego projektu. - Mogą być tworzone jako pliki tekstowe lub pliki w różnych językach programowania, umożliwiając korzystanie z podświetlania składni i innych funkcji IDE. - Wspierają pełną edycję kodu, tak jak normalne pliki projektu, włączając w to autouzupełnianie, inspekcje i refactorings. 2. **Consoles (konsoli):** - Pozwalają na interaktywne uruchamianie fragmentów kodu w środowisku REPL dla obsługiwanych języków. - Są przydatne do szybkiego testowania i debugowania wyrażeń językowych, bez konieczności uruchamiania całej aplikacji. - Mogą być używane do interakcji z bazami danych, wykonywania zapytań SQL, pracy z systemem kontroli wersji, i innych celów wymagających interaktywnej konsoli. Dzięki \\"Scratches and Consoles\\", developerzy mogą prowadzić bieżące zadania programistyczne bez zanieczyszczania głównego kodu aplikacji i bez potrzeby otwierania dodatkowych narzędzi lub aplikacji notatnikowych. To wygodna funkcja w środowiskach deweloperskich, kiedy potrzeba miejsca na szybkie zadania lub kiedy nie chce się tworzyć nowego projektu lub pliku tylko dla jednorazowego, prostego zadania. Aby utworzyć nowy \\"scratch\\" w WebStorm, możesz wybrać \\"File > New > Scratch File\\" a następnie wybrać typ pliku, który chcesz stworzyć. Analogicznie, dostęp do konsoli zazwyczaj jest możliwy przez dolny panel w IDE, który domyślnie zawiera zakładki dla różnych konsoli interaktywnych."},{"instruction":"Jak w technologii GSAP zarejestrować kilka lini czasowych , dla każdego obiektu osobna linia czasowa?","output":"W GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP), linie czasowe (ang. timelines) pozwalają kontrolować wiele animacji jako skoordynowaną sekwencję. Możesz stworzyć wiele osobnych linii czasowych (TimelineMax lub TimelineLite w starszej wersji) dla różnych obiektów, które chcesz animować. Poniżej znajdziesz przykład jak to zrobić: \`\`\`javascript // Inicjalizacja pierwszej linii czasowej dla obiektu1 let tl1 = gsap.timeline({paused: true}); tl1.to(\\"#obiekt1\\", {duration: 1, x: 100}); // Inicjalizacja drugiej linii czasowej dla obiektu2 let tl2 = gsap.timeline({paused: true}); tl2.to(\\"#obiekt2\\", {duration: 1, y: 100}); // Inicjalizacja trzeciej linii czasowej dla obiektu3 let tl3 = gsap.timeline({paused: true}); tl3.to(\\"#obiekt3\\", {duration: 1, alpha: 0}); // ... możesz kontynuować dodawanie kolejnych linii czasowych dla innych obiektów \`\`\` W powyższym przykładzie dla każdego obiektu stworzona została osobna linia czasowa. Obiekty są wybierane przez selektory CSS, podobnie jak w jQuery, więc \\"#obiekt1\\", \\"#obiekt2\\", i \\"#obiekt3\\" odnoszą się do elementów z odpowiednimi identyfikatorami w HTML. Plik \`.to()\` to jedna z metod dostępnych w GSAP, która pozwala na dodanie \\"tween\\" do linii czasowej. W methodzie tej definiujemy docelowy obiekt animacji, a także różne właściwości animacji i ich ostateczne wartości. Ustawienie \`{paused: true}\` w konfiguracji linii czasowej powoduje, że animacja nie ruszy automatycznie po stworzeniu - w ten sposób masz pełną kontrolę nad jej odegraniem. Aby uruchomić każdą z tych linii czasowych, możesz użyć metody \`.play()\` na odpowiednich obiektach Timeline: \`\`\`javascript tl1.play(); // Uruchom animację dla obiektu1 tl2.play(); // Uruchom animację dla obiektu2 tl3.play(); // Uruchom animację dla obiektu3 \`\`\` Użycie osobnych linii czasowych pozwala na bardziej złożone kontrolowanie animacji, gdzie każda z nich może mieć różne czasy trwania, może być opóźniona lub sytuacje w których potrzebujesz je uruchomić we własnych specyficznych czasach."},{"instruction":"A jak stworzyć globalną linię czasową na której będą zagnieżdżone podrzędne animacje i sterowane będą za pomocą głównej lini czasowej?","output":"W GSAP można stworzyć globalną linię czasową, do której następnie dodasz podrzędne (zagnieżdżone) animacje. Każdą podrzędną animację tworzy się jako osobny obiekt Timeline, a następnie można je dołączać do głównej linii czasowej za pomocą metody \`.add()\`. Oto sposób, w jaki można to zrobić: \`\`\`javascript // Tworzenie głównej globalnej linii czasowej let mainTimeline = gsap.timeline(); // Tworzenie pierwszej podrzędnej linii czasowej let tl1 = gsap.timeline(); tl1.to(\\"#obiekt1\\", {duration: 1, x: 100}); // Tworzenie drugiej podrzędnej linii czasowej let tl2 = gsap.timeline(); tl2.to(\\"#obiekt2\\", {duration: 1, y: 100}); // Tworzenie trzeciej podrzędnej linii czasowej let tl3 = gsap.timeline(); tl3.to(\\"#obiekt3\\", {duration: 1, opacity: 0}); // Dodawanie podrzędnych linii czasowych do głównej linii czasowej mainTimeline .add(tl1) .add(tl2) .add(tl3); // Opcjonalnie, możesz też ustawić późniejszy start dla każdej z podrzędnych linii czasowych // lub dodać je z overlapem: mainTimeline .add(tl1, \\"+=0.5\\") // zaczyna 0.5 sekundy po poprzedniej animacji .add(tl2, \\"-=0.5\\") // zaczyna 0.5 sekundy przed końcem tl1 .add(tl3, \\"label\\"); // zaczyna w etykiecie \\"label\\" (którą musisz zdefiniować wcześniej w głównej linii czasowej) // Można teraz kontrolować główna linię czasową i wszystkie podrzędne linie czasowe będą sterowane równocześnie mainTimeline.play(); // Odtwarza całą animację mainTimeline.pause(); // Pauzuje całą animację mainTimeline.reverse(); // Odtwarza całą animację w odwrotnej kolejności \`\`\` Ta metoda tworzy hierarchiczny system animacji, gdzie główna linia czasowa działa jako kontroler dla wszystkich zagnieżdżonych animacji. Metody \`.play()\`, \`.pause()\`, i \`.reverse()\` zastosowane do głównej linii czasowej mają wpływ na wszystkie zagnieżdżone animacje. Kiedy dodajesz podrzędne linie czasowe do głównej linii czasowej, możesz określić również, kiedy dokładnie ma zacząć się dana animacja. Możesz to robić za pomocą etykiet, względnych czasów lub bezpośrednio określając czas w sekundach. Ta metoda pozwala zachować czysty i łatwy do zrozumienia kod zwłaszcza w przypadku złożonych sekwencji animacji, gdzie różne sekcje animacji muszą być względem siebie zsynchronizowane lub sekwencyjne."},{"instruction":"Możesz mi wytłumaczyć w technologii GSAP użycie globalnej lini czasowej \\"gsap.globalTimeline\\".","output":"\`gsap.globalTimeline\` to specjalny obiekt w GSAP reprezentujący główną, globalną linię czasową (global timeline), do której domyślnie przypisywane są wszystkie tworzone tweens i timelines.

Każdy tween lub timeline, który tworzysz przy użyciu GSAP (i który nie jest explicite dodany do innej, niestandardowej linii czasowej), automatycznie zostaje częścią \`gsap.globalTimeline\`. Oto kilka rzeczy, które możesz zrobić z \`gsap.globalTimeline\`: 1. **Pauzowanie i wznawianie wszystkich animacji:** Aby zapauzować wszystkie bieżące animacje, można użyć \`gsap.globalTimeline.pause()\`. Aby wznowić, użyj \`gsap.globalTimeline.resume()\`. \`\`\`javascript gsap.globalTimeline.pause(); // Pauzuje wszystkie animacje gsap.globalTimeline.resume(); // Wznawia wszystkie animacje \`\`\` 2. **Zmiana szybkości (skala czasu) wszystkich animacji:** Jeśli chcesz przyspieszyć lub zwolnić wszystkie animacje, możesz zmienić właściwość \`timeScale\` \`gsap.globalTimeline\`. \`\`\`javascript gsap.globalTimeline.timeScale(0.5); // Zwolnienie animacji do 50% normalnej szybkości gsap.globalTimeline.timeScale(2); // Przyspieszenie animacji do 200% normalnej szybkości \`\`\` 3. **Sterowanie wszystkimi animacjami wstecz:** Aby odtworzyć wszystkie animacje od końca do początku, użyj \`gsap.globalTimeline.reverse()\`. \`\`\`javascript gsap.globalTimeline.reverse(); // Odwraca wszystkie animacje \`\`\` Należy jednak być ostrożnym przy używaniu \`gsap.globalTimeline\`, gdyż zmiany zastosowane do niego wpłyną na wszystkie animacje w projekcie. Dlatego, jeśli masz więcej niż jedną grupę animacji, które chcesz kontrolować oddzielnie, lepiej jest tworzyć szczegółowe linie czasowe za pomocą \`gsap.timeline()\` i kontrolować je niezależnie. Ważne jest, aby pamiętać, że \`gsap.globalTimeline\` to zaawansowana funkcjonalność i wielu developerów może z sukcesem tworzyć animacje w GSAP bez bezpośredniego korzystania z tego obiektu. W nowszych wersjach GSAP, zamiast \`TimelineMax\` czy \`TimelineLite\`, wszystkie linie czasowe są tworzone przy użyciu samego \`gsap.timeline()\`.

Oto przykład: \`\`\`javascript // Tworzenie linii czasowej rodzica let parentTimeline = gsap.timeline(); // Tworzenie linii czasowej dziecka let childTimeline = gsap.timeline(); // Dodawanie animacji do linii czasowej dziecka childTimeline.to(\\"#elementDziecko\\", { duration: 1, x: 100 }); // Dodawanie animacji do linii czasowej rodzica parentTimeline.to(\\"#elementRodzic\\", { duration: 1, y: 100 }); // Zagnieżdżanie linii czasowej dziecka w linii czasowej rodzica parentTimeline.add(childTimeline); // Teraz nadrzędna linia czasowa (parentTimeline) kontroluje podrzędną (childTimeline) // Możesz sterować nimi przez parentTimeline parentTimeline.play(); // Odtwarza zarówno animacje rodzica jak i dziecka parentTimeline.pause(); // Pauzuje wszystkie zagnieżdżone animacje parentTimeline.reverse(); // Odtwarza od końca do początku wszystkie zagnieżdżone animacje // Możesz również zaplanować start linii czasowej dziecka w konkretnym momencie // Dodawanie linii czasowej dziecka z opóźnieniem względem linii czasowej rodzica parentTimeline.add(childTimeline, \\"+=0.5\\"); // Startuje 0.5 sekundy po animacjach rodzica // lub parentTimeline.add(childTimeline, \\"-=0.5\\"); // Startuje 0.5 sekundy przed końcem animacji rodzica // lub parentTimeline.add(childTimeline, \\"label\\"); // Startuje w momencie oznaczonym etykietą \\"label\\" (musisz dodać etykietę wcześniej) \`\`\` W tym przykładzie, \`parentTimeline\` oraz \`childTimeline\` są dwoma niezależnymi liniami czasowymi, a \`childTimeline\` zostało zagnieżdżone w \`parentTimeline\`. Efektem tego jest to, że sterując \`parentTimeline\`, sterujesz tak naprawdę także \`childTimeline\`. Przy planowaniu, możesz szczegółowo rozlokować rozpoczęcia animacji w linii czasowej dziecka, stosując opóźnienia lub etykiety, dzięki czemu animacja dziecka nie musi zaczynać się od razu, ale może być zsynchronizowana z określonym punktem rodzica albo innej animacji.

Przeanalizujmy poszczególne części kodu: 1. **Definicja pomocniczych funkcji matematycznych:** Obiekt \`Mathutils\` zawiera trzy funkcje: - \`normalize\` - mapuje wartość z jednego zakresu na zakres 0-1. - \`interpolate\` - mapuje znormalizowaną wartość z powrotem na inny zakres. - \`map\` - kombinuje \`normalize\` i \`interpolate\` do mapowania wartości z jednego zakresu na inny, z opcjonalnym ograniczeniem wartości do zadanego zakresu. 2. **Inicjalizacja Three.js:** - Utworzony jest renderer WebGL, scena 3D (\`scene\`) oraz kamera (\`camera\`). - Scena jest wypełniona obiektami (\`tube\` i \`wireframe\`), które będą reprezentować strukturę 3D. - Zastosowano efekt \`UnrealBloomPass\` do dodania rozmytego światła (bloom) na rendererze, co dodaje efekt świetlistego blasku. 3. **Tworzenie ścieżki animacji:** - Tablica \`points\` zawiera punkty, które są konwertowane na \`Vector3\` i wykorzystane do utworzenia ścieżki animacji za pomocą \`CatmullRomCurve3\`. - Do ścieżki przypisany jest obiekt \`tube\`, który ma tekstury i mapowanie wypukłości (bump map). 4. **Przygotowanie animacji kamery:** - Funkcja \`updateCameraPercentage\` aktualizuje pozycję kamery na ścieżce. - Wartości \`cameraTargetPercentage\` i \`currentCameraPercentage\` są wykorzystywane do kontrolowania procentu przebywania ścieżki przez kamerę. 5. **Ustawienie ScrollTrigger w GSAP:** - ScrollTrigger jest rejestrowana i używana do powiązania przewijania strony z animacją, gdzie \`timeline\` steruje procentowym postępem kamery na ścieżce. 6. **Renderowanie sceny:** - Funkcja \`render\` jest wywoływana rekurencyjnie i odpowiada za aktualizację i renderowanie sceny. 7. **Interakcje użytkownika:** - Obiekt \`('canvas').click\` dodaje bieżącą pozycję kamery do tablicy \`markers\` za każdym kliknięciem na płótnie (\`canvas\`). - Zdarzenie \`resize\` aktualizuje renderer i kamerę, gdy zmienia się rozmiar okna. - Zdarzenie \`mousemove\` zmienia wartości \`cameraRotationProxyX\` i \`cameraRotationProxyY\` w oparciu o pozycję myszki, co wpływa na obrót kamery. 8. **Tworzenie systemu cząsteczek:** - Trzy systemy cząsteczek (\`particleSystem1\`, \`particleSystem2\`, \`particleSystem3\`) są tworzone i dodawane do sceny. - Tekstura \`spikeyTexture\` jest używana do stworzenia efektu wizualnego dla cząsteczek. Podsumowując, skrypt tworzy wizualizację 3D z animowaną kamerą, która porusza się po ścieżce w oparciu o przewijanie strony i interakcje z myszką. Scenę uatrakcyjniają efekt bloom oraz ruchome cząsteczki."},{"instruction":"Ayer, como todos los dias, me levanté a las seis de la mañana y me preparé para ir al trabajo.

Me vestí, desayuné con mi familia y revisé mi mochila para asegurarme de que tenía todos los libros y cuadernos necesarios para el día. A las seis y media, salí de casa y caminé hasta la parada de autobús. El día en el colegio transcurrió como siempre: entre clases, recreos y conversaciones con mis amigos. Estudié mucho durante las clases, prestando especial atención a los ejercicios de matemáticas y las explicaciones del profesor de ciencias. En el recreo, como es costumbre, jugué al fútbol con mis compañeros, disfrutando de la emoción del partido y del breve descanso de las aulas. Después de varias horas de estudio, mis clases terminaron a las cuatro de la tarde, cuando me despedí de mis amigos y comencé el camino de regreso a casa. De vuelta en casa, mi rutina continuó: merendé algo ligero y comencé a hacer mis deberes. Me concentré en resolver los problemas de matemáticas y en redactar un ensayo para mi clase de francés. Aunque era un día agotador y lleno de tareas, ayer tuvo una sorpresa especial. Después de cenar, mis padres me anunciaron que esa noche iría a mi primer partido de fútbol en un estadio, algo que siempre había deseado. La emoción me invadió y rápidamente terminé mis deberes. El partido fue increíble, con un ambiente lleno de pasión y alegría. Grité y aplaudí con cada jugada, sintiéndome parte de una gran comunidad de aficionados. Al regresar a casa, me fui a dormir extenuado pero feliz, con la sensación de haber vivido un día diferente y emocionante, un día que, sin duda, recordaré por mucho tiempo."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:j},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},q={class:"search-container"},B={class:"card-container"},W={key:0,class:"empty-state"},D=["disabled"],H={key:0},Y={key:1};function E(o,e,h,m,n,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",q,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",B,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",W,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
