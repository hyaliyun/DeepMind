The wonderful world which lies before us today has been put up by hardworking men with clear heads and inventive mind, and these who follow them along life's road will improve on their efforts. It is sometimes necessary to question and even to disbelieve some of the statements made by experts. Action or experiment can often end an argument or achieve a breakthrough. When men were wondering whether it was possible to reach India by sailing westwards from Europe, and whether there was any land on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, Christopher Columbus decides to act. He gathered some men, invited them to go on board his three ships, and set out across the dangerous waters of the Atlantic Ocean. He was successful in finding land, but it was not India. The result of his action was that the arguments came to the end. Any young man who wishes to do research must be courageous enough to question old beliefs and do some original thinking about them. Although we seem to know so much, there are many things we don't know. Even when we pull an atom to pieces, we do not really know what the pieces are, we often do not reach the reality behind what we discover, and the more we learn, the better we realize our ignorance.

Scottish fullback Stuart Hogg, the Lions' youngest player at 20, looked to get his tour off on a positive note but the beginning of a scything run a couple of minutes into the match was brought to juddering halt by a crunching tackle by Barbarians center Casey Lualala.

Just days earlier, the board of American Apparel finally ousted Dov Charney, the company’s flamboyant founder and controversy magnet. And there was Mary Jo White, the chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, standing in front of an audience that included a fair number of corporate directors, urging them to be more accountable. In the speech, at the Rock Center for Corporate Governance at Stanford University, Ms. White emphasized their crucial duty to protect shareholders from abusive practices at companies they oversee. “Setting the standard in the boardroom that good corporate governance and rigorous compliance are essential goes a long way in engendering a strong corporate culture throughout an organization,” Ms. White said, later adding that “ethics and honesty can become core corporate values when directors and senior executives embrace them.” Why wouldn’t board members embrace these values? Cozy board ties with the chief executive might be one reason. A recent academic study, to be published in the July-August issue of The Accounting Review, suggests that lax oversight can result when a director of a company is friendly with the chief executive overseeing it. But the research makes a counterintuitive finding as well. The conventional wisdom holds that when you disclose personal ties, you create transparency and better governance. The experiment found that when social relationships were disclosed as part of director-independence regulations, board members didn’t toughen their oversight of their chief-executive pals. Rather, the directors went easier on the C.E.O., perhaps believing that they had done their duty by disclosing the relationship. The study, “Will Disclosure of Friendship Ties between Directors and C.E.O.s Yield Perverse Effects?,” was conducted by four academics: Jacob M. Rose and Anna M. Rose of Bentley University, Carolyn Strand Norman of Virginia Commonwealth University and Cheri R. Mazza of Sacred Heart University. Back in 2013, the researchers set out to conduct a thought experiment with a group of directors on the topic of board relationships. The academics secured the participation of 56 current directors at companies of all sizes. The participants had 30 years of business experience, on average, and generally served on multiple boards — 2.64 was the mean. About one-quarter of the directors served on an audit committee. In the experiment, the directors were asked to role-play as board members of a hypothetical biotech company that was about to report earnings for the year. The company had been expected to earn 805 million, the directors were told, but its actual profits were going to be just 800 million. That shortfall would have an impact on the compensation of the chief executive, who would receive a bonus only if the company earned at least 810 million. The directors participating in the experiment were divided into two groups. Two-thirds were told to assume that they had a personal or social relationship with the C.E.O. of the biotech company. The remaining third were told they had no such tie. Of those who were friendly with the executive, half were told that they had disclosed their relationship to the board, to company management and to shareholders. The other half were told to assume that they hadn’t made the disclosure. The only option given to the directors to make up the shortfall — and thus help the C.E.O. get a bonus — was to cut the company’s 40 million budget for research and development. As they weighed this possibility, they were told that for every 1 million cut in that budget, there would be a 1 percent increase in the chance that the company would lose ground to its competitors. Now for the results: Among the directors who counted the C.E.O. as a friend, 46 percent said they would cut research and development by one-quarter or more to ensure a bonus payout to their pal. By contrast, only 6 percent of directors with no personal ties to the chief executive agreed to reduce research and development to generate a bonus. The results get more interesting when disclosure is added to the mix. Of the directors who said they would cut 10 million or more from the budget — the amount necessary to generate a bonus to the chief executive — an astonishing 62 percent had disclosed a friendship with the C.E.O. Only 28 percent of the directors who had not disclosed their relationship with the executive agreed to make the cuts necessary to generate a bonus. Only one director with no ties to the executive agreed to cut the budget by 10 million or more. Mr. Rose, an author of the paper, said he and his colleagues were surprised that so many directors said they’d be willing to put the company at risk to ensure a bonus for their pal, the C.E.O. “If just by mentioning that you’re friends with the C.E.O. it affects their decision-making, we think the effects going on in the real world are much, much larger than what we picked up in the lab,” Mr. Rose said in an interview last week. Even more disturbing, he said, was that so many directors seemed to think that disclosing their friendships with the C.E.O. gave them license to put the executive’s interests ahead of the company’s. “When you disclose things, it may make you feel you’ve met your obligations,” Mr. Rose said. “They’re not all that worried about doing something to help out the C.E.O. because everyone has had a fair warning.” There are two messages in this study. One is for regulators: Simply disclosing a conflict or friendship does not eliminate its potential to create problems. The other is for investors. “Shareholders should take a more active role in finding out what kinds of relationships their boards and C.E.O.s have,” Mr. Rose said, “and recognize the potential traps created by them.” A version of this article appears in print on June 29, 2014, on page BU1 of the New York edition with the headline: The C.E.O.

The study finds that when there is a friendship between a director and a CEO, the oversight provided by the director may become lax. Interestingly, the study also finds that disclosing personal ties between the two parties does not necessarily improve governance. In fact, it shows that board members tend to be more lenient with their CEO friends after disclosing the relationship, perhaps believing that transparency was enough to fulfill their duties. The researchers conducted a thought experiment with 56 current directors from various companies to explore board relationships. The directors were asked to role-play as board members of a hypothetical biotech company with a CEO whose bonus was tied to the company's earnings. The directors had to decide whether they would cut the company's research and development budget to help the CEO reach his bonus target. The results showed that directors with a personal relationship with the CEO were more likely to make budget cuts to help their CEO friend, while those without such ties were less likely to do so. Additionally, disclosing the friendship did not lead to tougher decisions, but rather, more leniency from the directors. This study highlights that simply disclosing a conflict or friendship does not eliminate its potential to create problems. The researchers suggest that shareholders should be more proactive in getting to know the relationships between their boards and CEOs and recognize the potential pitfalls associated with them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Americans Spend Their Free Time In Various Ways America is a country of sports--of hunting,fishing and swimming,and of team sports like baseball and football.Millions of Americans watch their favorite sports on television.They also like to play in community orchestras ,make their own films or recordings,go camping,visit museums,attend lectures,travel,garden,read,and join in hundreds of other activities.The people also enjoy building things for their homes,sewing their own clothes,even making their own photographs.They do these things for fun as well as for economy. But as much as Americans enjoy their free time,the country is at the same time a\\"self-improvement\\" country.More than 25 million adults continue their education,chiefly by going to school in the evening, during their own free time,at their own expense.Added to the time spent on personal activities,Americans a1so devote a great amount of their time to the varied needs of their communities.Many hospitals,schools,libraries,museums,parks,community centers,and organizations that assist the poor depend on the many hours citizens devote to these activities,often without any pay. Why do they do it? There are several answers.The idea of cooperating and sharing responsibility with one another for the benefit of all is as old as the country itself. When the country was first founded in 1776,it was necessary for the settlers to work together to live.They had crossed dangerous seas and risked all they had in their struggle for political and religious freedom.There remains among many Americans a distrust of central government.People still prefer to do things themselves within their communities,rather than give the government more control. Sometimes people offer their time because they wish to accomplish something for which no money is paid,to do something that will be of benefit to the entire community.It is true that some people use their _ because they are truly interested in the work;or they are learning from the experience. No matter what the reason... Question: The writer mentions the foundation of the country in order to indicate   _  . - the reason for Americans' willingness to cooperate and share responsibility - the American people's determination to live - the American people's love for freedom - the early history of America Answer:","output":"the reason for Americans' willingness to cooperate and share responsibility"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Counting Cars is spinoff similiar to which television series that chronicled the daily activities at \\"Rick's Restorations\\"?","output":"Counting Cars is a spinoff television series similar to the show \\"American Restoration.\\" American Restoration originally aired on the History Channel and chronicled the daily activities at Rick's Restorations, a shop owned and operated by Rick Dale and his team. The shop specializes in the restoration of classic items, antiques, and unique collectibles to their original condition. The connection between Counting Cars and American Restoration stems from their shared focus on restoration, the presence of a specialized team with expert knowledge, and similar themes related to preserving the value and history of items. Both shows were part of the network's lineup of reality TV series that revolved around skilled craftsmen and their businesses. Moreover, these shows appealed to a wide audience, from automobile enthusiasts to fans of antiques and history. Counting Cars, which also aired on the History Channel, is set in Las Vegas and follows Danny \\"The Count\\" Koker, who owns Count's Kustoms, an automobile restoration and customization workshop. The show highlights Koker and his team as they work on various projects, including the restoration and customization of classic automobiles, motorcycles, and other unique vehicles. Featuring fascinating stories and colorful characters, the series showcases the artistic, technical, and historical aspects of vehicle restoration. While American Restoration focused on a broader range of items, such as gas pumps, soda machines, vending machines, and more, Counting Cars takes a more specialized approach by concentrating mainly on the restoration and customization of vehicles. Both shows provide viewers with an in-depth look into the craftsmanship, challenges, and triumphs that come with the restoration process and highlight the dedication and expertise of the people involved in these projects. In conclusion, Counting Cars is a spinoff similar to American Restoration as they both share themes of restoration, teamwork, and a fascination with preserving and reviving the history of collectibles.

Article: Buying a house for most of the people is a once in a lifetime decision, which means people decide to do so only after coming across the ideal house. Surprisingly, eight in every 10 home buyers are unhappy with their houses. A survey conducted by the Beijing Consumers' Association (BCA) recently shows about 80 percent of the 2,315 respondents in 23 residential complexes of Beijing are dissatisfied with the soaring house prices. They think the reasonable price in Beijing should be between 3,000 yuan and 7,000 yuan per square meter. The quality of the buildings, the surrounding environment and traffic and property management are the other factors that play a role in people's decision to buy a house. The BCA has suggested strict sales regulations and contracts to ease house-owners' sufferings. It has urged the authorities to impose severe punishment on developers found violating building and other rules and joining hands with others to bid up property prices, About 41.2 percent of the respondents have complained that their house have defective designs, while nearly 40 percent say the lighting and ventilation are far from satisfactory. The landscapes in the residential areas are a source of unhappiness for 43.2 percent of the respondents, and about one-third say they were \\" \\" into buying \\"third grade\\" house. And more than half are not satisfied with the sport and entertainment facilities in their neighborhood. Property management in the buildings, 56.5 percent of the respondents say, is way below standard compared to the high fee charged by the complexes. 60 percent of the consumers doubt the contents of developers' advertisements, with only 6.3 percent being satisfied. Experts have suggested consumers gather thorough knowledge about a developer and their work before deciding to buy a house from it. They should check the day-light conditions and ventilation in different weather conditions in advance, if possible. Question: If you want to buy a flat, according to the survey, you will consider the following EXCEPT   _   .

What album cover parodied that of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The Mothers of Invention played in New York in late 1966 and were offered a contract at the Garrick Theater (at 152 Bleecker Street, above the Cafe au Go Go) during Easter 1967. This proved successful and Herb Cohen extended the booking, which eventually lasted half a year. As a result, Zappa and his wife, along with the Mothers of Invention, moved to New York. Their shows became a combination of improvised acts showcasing individual talents of the band as well as tight performances of Zappa's music. Everything was directed by Zappa using hand signals. Guest performers and audience participation became a regular part of the Garrick Theater shows. One evening, Zappa managed to entice some U.S. Marines from the audience onto the stage, where they proceeded to dismember a big baby doll, having been told by Zappa to pretend that it was a \\"gook baby\\".Zappa uniquely contributed to the avant-garde, anti-establishment music scene of the 1960s, sampling radio tape recordings and incorporating his own philosophical ideals to music and freedom of expression in his pieces. Bands such as AMM and Faust also contributed to the radio sampling techniques of the 1960s. Situated in New York, and only interrupted by the band's first European tour, the Mothers of Invention recorded the album widely regarded as the peak of the group's late 1960s work, We're Only in It for the Money (released 1968). It was produced by Zappa, with Wilson credited as executive producer. From then on, Zappa produced all albums released by the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. We're Only in It for the Money featured some of the most creative audio editing and production yet heard in pop music, and the songs ruthlessly satirized the hippie and flower power phenomena. He sampled plundered surf music in We're only in It for the Money, as well as the Beatles' tape work from their song Tomorrow Never Knows. The cover photo parodied that of the Beatles' Sgt.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer this question. How many sides does a hendecagon have?","output":"A hendecagon, also known as an undecagon, is a polygon with eleven sides and eleven vertices. This geometrical shape derives its name from the Greek words \\"hendeca\\" or \\"undeca,\\" which mean eleven, and \\"gonia,\\" meaning angle. Consequently, a hendecagon consists of eleven angles as well. In a regular hendecagon, all the sides and angles are congruent, meaning they have the same length and degree measure, respectively. To find the sum of the interior angles of a hendecagon, one can use the formula: Sum of interior angles = (n - 2) × 180° where n represents the number of sides in the polygon. For an hendecagon, n = 11: Sum of interior angles = (11 - 2) × 180° = 9 × 180° = 1,620° Each individual angle within a regular hendecagon can be determined by dividing the sum of the interior angles by the number of angles: Each individual angle = Sum of interior angles / 11 = 1,620° / 11 ≈ 147.27° In real-world applications, hendecagons can be seen in specific geometric designs, architecture, and art. Though less commonly used than polygons with fewer sides, the hendecagon still contributes to the diversity of shapes in various fields."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Hugo Gye. PUBLISHED:. 10:10 EST, 13 December 2012. |. UPDATED:. 07:43 EST, 14 December 2012. Jailed: Wlodzimierz Umaniec has been sentenced to two years in prison for vandalising a Rothko painting. The self-proclaimed artist who vandalised a Mark Rothko painting in what he said was an act of 'yellowism' was today sentenced to two years in prison. Wlodzimierz Umaniec, 26, also known as Vladimir Umanets, defaced the mural, worth around £5million to £9million, at the Tate Modern gallery on October 7. He has said he carried out the crime in an attempt to spread the principles of the obscure artistic movement which he helped create. Umaniec, a Polish national living in. Worthing, West Sussex, admitted criminal damage to the value of in. excess of £5,000 - but estimates suggest the restoration of the painting. will cost around £200,000. The. vandal stepped over a barrier in the art gallery and daubed his name. and the words 'a potential piece of yellowism' before fleeing. The. court heard that he went to the gallery intending to put his. 'signature' on a picture, but decided to damage the Rothko painting only. in the moment he saw it on display. The gallery was then put into 'operation shutdown' with people prevented from leaving or entering the building. Umaniec. has argued that his actions were themselves a work of art, as the rules. of 'yellowism' dictate that anything can be an example of the genre as. long as it is endorsed by a member of the movement. But. judge Roger Chapple said of 'yellowism' that it was 'wholly and utterly. unacceptable to promote it by damaging a work of art' which he called a. 'gift to the nation'. Art? Umaniec claimed that his vandalism was in itself a powerful artistic statement. Speaking. at Inner London Crown Court, he told Umaniec: 'Your actions on the 7th. of October of this year were entirely deliberate, planned and. intentional.' He said. it was 'abundantly clear' that Umaniec was 'plainly an intelligent man' and told the court he had described Rothko as a 'great painter' in a. letter he had written to him. The judge also said the incident had led to galleries reviewing security arrangements at a cost to themselves and the taxpayer. 'The effects of such security reviews is to distance the public from the works of art they come to enjoy,' he said. Supporter: Umaniec was accompanied by Ben Smith, who attempted to explain the principles of 'yellowism' Gregor McKinley, prosecuting, said: 'The work required to restore this picture will be complex and lengthy. 'Complications to this work include the unique painting technique used by the artist and the fact the ink used by Mr Umaniec has permeated the paint layers and the canvas itself.' Mr McKinley said work to restore the painting will take about 20 months and cost 'something around £200,000'. Paintings by Russian-born artist Rothko often fetch tens of millions of pounds. Earlier this year, his Orange, Red, Yellow sold in New York for £53.8million - the highest price paid for a piece of post-War art at auction. The defaced painting, called Black On Maroon, was donated to the Tate in 1969 by Rothko himself. Outside court before the sentencing, Ben Smith, who called himself a 'yellowist', attempted to explain the concept: 'Everything is equal. Everything is art. Everything is a potential piece of yellowism.' After the sentencing, Mr Smith, who had come along to support Umaniec in court, said Umaniec's time in prison would be 'one of the most creative points for him' and will 'give him a greater understanding of humanity'. Speaking about the incident he said: 'This was not an act of destruction. It was an act of creativity. 'Now yellowism is a global phenomenon.' A spokeswoman for the gallery said: 'Tate is pleased that the court has recognised the severity of this incident and its consequences when sentencing Wlodzimierz Umaniec to two years in prison.' What are highlight points for this article?","output":"This article is about a man named Wlodzimierz Umaniec, who vandalized a very valuable painting by an artist named Mark Rothko. He said he did it to promote something called \\"yellowism,\\" which is a type of art movement. However, a judge decided that this reason was not acceptable and sentenced him to two years in prison. The damage he caused to the painting is very difficult and expensive to fix, costing around £200,000 and taking about 20 months to complete."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The fan and motor are a bit loud for a SOHO setting.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here's a question: The referee called a foul when one player punched another.  The player went to the penalty box. What game are they playing?  Here are possible answers to this question: - sporting event - time race - part two boxers - football - hockey game  I believe the correct choice is \\"hockey game\\", here's why: The answer to this question is:","output":"\\"Hockey game\\". There are several reasons that make this the most likely reasoning given the information provided. First, let's discuss the context of the clues given. The context mentions a referee, a foul, a punch, and a penalty box. While several different types of sports games involve referees and fouls, their punishments for such fouls can differ greatly. In the context of a game, a referee's role is to ensure that the rules of the game are followed, and they have the authority to enforce disciplinary action if a player commits a breach of rules or a \\"foul\\". The act of one player punching another is considered a major foul and it is heavily penalized in most sports. However, it does happen in situations of heightened aggression. Usually, in such intense physical contact sports, there exists an space or area to where a player may be sent as consequence for major infractions. This place is known as a \\"penalty box\\".   The term \\"penalty box\\" is specific to some sports, most notably ice hockey, which refers to the area where a player who has been charged with a penalty sits to serve the time of the penalty. It's usually a small, box-like area in the rink, set apart from the player's bench. The player sits in the box while the game continues, and the player's team is forced to be shorthanded by one player - a significant disadvantage. Breaking down the answer options: 1. \\"Sporting Event\\" - This is a very broad term and can apply to virtually any type of physical competition. It's not specifically indicative of what exact game is in play. 2. \\"Time Race\\" - There is no mention of speed, tracks, or a finish line, and \\"penalty box\\" is not a terminology found in racing sports. 3. \\"Part Two Boxers\\" - In boxing, there is no penalty box. Also, punching is the objective of the sport, not a foul. 4. \\"Football\\" - Though it often involves fouls and penalties, there is no \\"penalty box\\" in American football. In football (soccer), there is an area referred to as penalty box, but it doesn't function as where a penalized player stays temporarily out of game. Also, punching in football would lead to immediate ejection and not a temporary penalty. 5. \\"Hockey Game\\" - Referees, fouls, players, punches and penalty boxes are all elements present in a hockey game. When a player commits a major infraction, such as punching, they are sent to the \\"penalty box\\" to serve their time. Given all of this information, it can be concluded that the game being referred to is a \\"Hockey game\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Find the right ending to this passage.

Heaving rains in Mexico, the world's largest lime producer and where the U.S. get's 97 per cent of its supply, combined with a crop disease are contributing to the short supply of juicy limes. But more concerning is the crime caused by the Knights Templar drug cartel in the state of Michoacan, where the most limes are produced.

This is because Mexico produces 97% of the U.S.'s limes, and most of them are produced in the state of Michoacan. So, the correct answer is \\"Mexico limes at a packing plant in Michoacan,\\" because it matches the information in the passage. The other options are wrong because: - Ashley Collman limes: Ashley Collman is the author of the passage, not a type of lime. - Cal-Mart Grocer limes and Gristedes market limes: These are stores mentioned in the passage where limes are sold, but they are not types of limes or places where limes are produced. - Knights Templar limes: Knights Templar is a drug cartel, not a type of lime. - Michoacan limes: Although Michoacan is the place where most limes are produced, listing it as a type of lime is repetitive in this context since the packing plant is already mentioned to be in Michoacan. - New York limes and San Francisco limes: These are cities in the U.S. where the passage mentions lime prices, but they are not types of limes or places where limes are produced. - U.S. limes: Since the passage says that the U.S. gets 97% of its supply from Mexico, it doesn't make sense to mention U.S. limes in the context of a packing plant in Michoacan, Mexico."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is magnetic field? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"First, let me clarify the two concepts separately. 1. Pulsating magnetic fields:  A pulsating magnetic field is a magnetic field that varies with time, usually characterized by a repetitive cycle of increasing and decreasing intensity. These fields can be generated using devices such as electromagnets, which produce magnetic fields by running an alternating current through a coil. Pulsating magnetic fields have applications in various fields like medical treatments, materials processing, and wireless power transmission. 2. Magnetic field:  A magnetic field is a vector field that represents the magnetic influence on moving electric charges, electric currents, and magnetic materials. The direction of the magnetic field at a point is given by the direction of the force a moving charge would experience due to the field. It is a fundamental phenomenon in physics, electromagnetism being one of the four fundamental forces of nature. Magnetic fields are produced by electric currents or by the magnetic moments of elementary particles, such as electrons. They have numerous applications in our daily lives, including creating the force that allows compasses to work and driving the operation of electric motors and generators. Now, to answer your third question: No, the questions about pulsating magnetic fields and magnetic fields are not the same. While the first question is about a specific type of magnetic field that changes its intensity over time in a repetitive cycle, the second question is about the general concept of a magnetic field, which includes both static (non-changing) and dynamic (changing) magnetic fields. Pulsating magnetic fields are a subset of magnetic fields, but not all magnetic fields are pulsating."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The initiative is expected to culminate in an exhibition in 2019. Six weeks before D-Day, troops gathered in Studland to rehearse the Normandy landings operation of World War Two - including the testing of the amphibious Valentine tanks. \\"They had a canvas screen around the outside and used displacement to float, and their engines were connected to propellers,\\" said David Willey, curator of Bovington's Tank Museum. The tanks came from a need to provide cover for soldiers as they mounted their first attacks on enemy land, he added. Although it is thought seven tanks lie in Studland Bay, only six are mentioned in a diary that documented the exercise. Charles Robert Gould, Victor Hartley, Albert Victor Kirby, Arthur Jackson Park, Earnest Granville Petty and Victor Noel Townson, of the 4th/7th Royal Dragoon Guards, lost their lives.

Second question: How many seats are in each department at the Anna University? Anna University, one of the premier technological institutions in India, houses diverse academic departments offering a multitude of programs at the undergraduate, postgraduate, and doctoral level. Due to this diversity and the constant updating of courses based on academic regulations, it is challenging for me to provide the exact number of seats in each department. However, the university features the following departments: 1. Faculty of Technology 2. Faculty of Information and Communication Engineering 3. Faculty of Civil Engineering 4. Faculty of Mechanical Engineering 5. Faculty of Electrical Engineering 6. Faculty of Management Sciences 7. Faculty of Science and Humanities 8. Faculty of Architecture and Planning Each faculty comprises multiple departments focusing on specific engineering disciplines and branches, with the number of seats varying depending on the demand and course. You may visit Anna University's website or contact them directly to inquire about the seats in each department for the course and year you are interested in. In conclusion, the two questions are not the same. The first question queries information regarding industrial quota seats, which is about a specific category of admission in collaboration with select industries. The second question asks for the number of seats in each department at Anna University, which refers to the intake capacity for different courses or programs within the university's various departments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Changes also took place among laymen, as aristocratic culture focused on great feasts held in halls rather than on literary pursuits. Clothing for the elites was richly embellished with jewels and gold. Lords and kings supported entourages of fighters who formed the backbone of the military forces.[I] Family ties within the elites were important, as were the virtues of loyalty, courage, and honour. These ties led to the prevalence of the feud in aristocratic society, examples of which included those related by Gregory of Tours that took place in Merovingian Gaul. Most feuds seem to have ended quickly with the payment of some sort of compensation. Women took part in aristocratic society mainly in their roles as wives and mothers of men, with the role of mother of a ruler being especially prominent in Merovingian Gaul. In Anglo-Saxon society the lack of many child rulers meant a lesser role for women as queen mothers, but this was compensated for by the increased role played by abbesses of monasteries. Only in Italy does it appear that women were always considered under the protection and control of a male relative.

Article: When you walk into the small Australian town of Coober Pedy, you may be surprised by what you can see. It's just barren   land there! So why even call it a town? There are more than 4,000 people of 48 nationalities. However, all of the people live underground! Coober Pedy was established  in 1915, following the discovery of opals  . The town is sometimes called the \\"opal capital of the world,\\" because it is the largest opal mining area in the world. Due to a desert climate  , people came to realize that while working under the ground was easy, living above it was not. The solution was to move underground, by changing old mines into homes and establishing the world's first and most likely, only underground town. As years have gone by, the homes have become bigger. There are now also some hotels for tourists. They come from all over the world just to see this unusual town. Coober Pedy is probably best known for its unique style  of underground living. While the structures  may be located underground, they are in no way worse than those that lie above. Not only do their walls have the color of beautiful red, but also the structures have all the modern equipment like walk-in closets, modern kitchens and televisions. And the town also has gift shops selling opal jewelry, a couple of museums and even a church! Besides, Coober Pedy is also a favourite among filmmakers. And it has appeared in a series of movies such as Pitch Black, Red Planet and Opal Dream. Question: Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage?

Albanian was proved to be an Indo-European language in 1854 by the German philologist Franz Bopp. The Albanian language comprises its own branch of the Indo-European language family. Some scholars believe that Albanian derives from Illyrian while others claim that it derives from Daco-Thracian. (Illyrian and Daco-Thracian, however, might have been closely related languages; see Thraco-Illyrian.) Establishing longer relations, Albanian is often compared to Balto-Slavic on the one hand and Germanic on the other, both of which share a number of isoglosses with Albanian. Moreover, Albanian has undergone a vowel shift in which stressed, long o has fallen to a, much like in the former and opposite the latter. Likewise, Albanian has taken the old relative jos and innovatively used it exclusively to qualify adjectives, much in the way Balto-Slavic has used this word to provide the definite ending of adjectives. The cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the Albanian language in the area of church texts and publications, mainly of the Catholic region in the North, but also of the Orthodox in the South. The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition when cleric Gjon Buzuku brought into the Albanian language the Catholic liturgy, trying to do for the Albanian language what Luther did for German.  After reading the above, is \\"Germanic\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What bigger language family does Daco-Thrycian belong to?\\"?","output":"No, \\"Germanic\\" is not the correct answer to the question \\"What bigger language family does Daco-Thracian belong to?\\" The passage states that Albanian language, which shares some similarities with Daco-Thracian, is part of the Indo-European language family. In the context provided, there is no evidence to support that Daco-Thracian belongs to the Germanic language family.

The England fly-half added a second penalty after the break but Ireland 10 Johnny Sexton's brace, to add to his first-half kick, levelled matters. Bath scored a penalty try from a scrum, only for Leinster to level through Josh van der Flier's converted try, but a third Ford penalty saw Bath edge home. Bath, who saw last weekend's game against Toulon postponed after the terror attacks in Paris, looked to play with pace and width from the first whistle, unafraid to attack from deep and keen to get their dangerous back three involved whenever possible. But Leinster's defence was superb, with Ben Teo'o making his mark in midfield, and in the end it was the power of the Bath scrum that proved key. They won half a dozen penalties at the scrum to deny Leinster momentum and give Ford the chance to keep the scoreboard ticking over. And it was a mighty shove midway though the second half that prompted referee Jerome Gacres to award the penalty try that looked like being crucial. Three-time champions Leinster rarely looked threatening but Sexton's boot kept them in touch, and when they brought on their replacements the new faces played a major role in levelling the score. They injected pace into the visitors' game and Leinster academy product Van Der Flier ran a beautiful line to slice through the Bath defence, before showing good strength to go over in a double tackle. The visitors then had a chance to take a late lead, but Sexton's 55m penalty attempt fell short and Bath countered from underneath their posts. When they were awarded a scrum midway inside the Leinster half, their fired-up eight again took the Irish side apart. From the resulting penalty, Ford made light of the difficult angle to drill the kick between the posts to secure victory for Bath and condemn Leinster to a second straight defeat. Bath head coach Mike Ford: \\"We showed our inexperience at 16-9 up. We were in control of the game, but we stupidly did things that let them back in. \\"I am pleased we won against a Leinster side full of internationals.

More than 270 Russian athletes were cleared to compete at the Olympics. Some banned athletes are still appealing against the decision to block their involvement at the Games. Commissioned by Wada, it looked into claims by Grigory Rodchenkov, the former head of Russia's national anti-doping laboratory. He alleged he doped dozens of athletes in the run-up to the 2014 Winter Games with the help of the Russian government, which he said exploited its host status to subvert the drug-testing programme.

Gonzorgo and Roderigo return and tell Mary, Barnaby, and the citizens of Mother Goose Land that Tom has accidentally drowned. They show Mary a forged letter in which Tom tells her that he is abandoning her and that she would be better off marrying Barnaby. Mary, believing she is destitute, reluctantly accepts the proposal from Barnaby. Barnaby unknowingly arranges for the same gypsies that have Tom to provide entertainment for the wedding. Tom, disguised as the gypsy Floretta, reveals himself and Barnaby pursues the frightened Gonzorgo and Roderigo, furious at their deception. One of the children who live with Mary informs her of some sheep tracks leading into the Forest of No Return. The children sneak away into the forest to search for the missing sheep. The trees of the forest awake and capture them. Tom and Mary follow and find the children in the forest, where they tell stories about the live trees. The trees seem just like ordinary trees to Tom and Mary. Tom, Mary and the children camp for the night. In the morning the trees once again come to life and explain that they are now in custody of the Toymaker in Toyland.

He says that \\"staying warm has a positive impact on an animal 's survival\\" and \\"effective insulation is the way to keep the warm air warm\\".   So, what's the best answer to the question? Select from: [A]. heat energy; [B]. survival; [C]. water; [D]. food; [E]. growth; [F]. ideas; [G]. Energy.; [H]. energy; The answer is:","output":"B. survival. The reason for this is that effective insulation helps an animal maintain its body temperature, which is crucial for its overall well-being. Staying warm directly impacts an animal's survival because it allows them to conserve energy, which can be utilized for other essential life processes, such as finding food, reproduction, and growth. In cold environments, it's vital for animals to maintain their body warmth, and effective insulation acts as a barrier to prevent heat loss. By keeping the warm air close to their bodies, animals can minimize heat loss and maintain an optimal body temperature. This conserves energy that would otherwise be used to generate more heat, ultimately enhancing the animal's chances of survival. If an animal were to lose heat too quickly or fail to conserve its energy, it could suffer from hypothermia, making it more vulnerable to predators and other environmental dangers. Thus, effective insulation is crucial for maintaining an animal's body temperature and, in turn, ensuring its survival."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

The priest is sent on a mission by the Pope  to find and protect the girl from Satan, although a few Vatican knights (led by a corrupt cardinal) insist that she must die. In New York a newborn girl, Christine York, is identified by Satanists (including her physician, Dr. Abel, and her nurse and future guardian, Mabel) as the person chosen to bear Satan's child on New Year's Eve, 1999. The Satanists perform occult rites on the newborn. In late 1999, Satan possesses an investment banker in a restaurant; he then destroys the restaurant, killing many inside. Suicidal and alcoholic former police detective Jericho Cane, depressed since his wife and daughter's contract killings, works for a private security company and blames God for his plight. Jericho and co-worker Bobby Chicago are assigned to protect the possessed banker. A priest, Thomas Aquinas, unsuccessfully tries to kill the banker. Jericho captures Aquinas, who tells Jericho: \\"The thousand years has ended, the dark angel is loosed from his prison\\" and says that a girl is central.

Looking to secure a playoff berth, the Falcons traveled to Seattle in their last regular-season road game to take on the Seahawks. Seattle took an early lead with a 1-yard TD run by Marshawn Lynch. Atlanta would later respond early in the second quarter with a Matt Ryan 3-yard TD pass to Jason Snelling, with Matt Bryant later adding a 27-yard field goal to take the lead. Seattle tied the game with a 38-yard field goal from Olindo Mare; however, the Falcons took the lead again with a Ryan 24-yard TD pass to Michael Jenkins to close the first half. On the Seahawks' first offensive possession of the second half, Matt Hasselbeck fumbled the football in the end-zone with defensive tackle Jonathan Babineaux recovering for a Falcons' touchdown.

Santana is a Latin music and rock band formed in San Francisco, California in 1966 by Mexican-American guitarist Carlos Santana. The band came to public attention with their performance of \\"Soul Sacrifice\\" at Woodstock in 1969. This exposure helped propel their first album, also named Santana, into a hit, followed in the next two years by Abraxas and Santana III. Lineup changes were common. The follow-up to Supernatural came three years later and was highly anticipated by international media and fans alike. On October 22, 2002, Shaman was released worldwide. Although it initially sold briskly (298,973 copies in the US in its first week) and debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200, the album's appeal quickly wore off and it soon slid down the charts. Despite this, it went on to sell 2x platinum in the US, and achieved platinum status in several other countries including Australia. The first single released from the album, \\"The Game of Love\\", which featured vocals from Michelle Branch, debuted at number 5 on the Hot 100. The album's next four singles failed to chart in most countries, but the final single, \\"Why Don't You & I\\", featuring the vocals of Alex Band, reached number 8 on the Hot 100. Musically, the album was a return to a more conventional sound for the group, with a mainly Latin rock-based sound.  With their renewed appeal worn off, another three-year wait saw the release of 2005's All That I Am. The album debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200 but fared worse internationally, and quickly lost appeal. The album, a continuation of the Latin-rock influenced sound of Shaman, achieved gold certification in the US. A five-year break from recording saw the release of another studio album, 2010's Guitar Heaven. Musically it was a drastic change for the band, with a far heavier sound at its core and strong heavy metal influences. It debuted at number 5 on the Billboard 200 but marked another decline for the band, failing to achieve gold status.  In 2012 the group released Shape Shifter, which returned to the conventional Latin rock sound and was completely album-oriented, as no singles were released from it. It debuted at number 16 on the Billboard 200.

In the first sentence: \\"The album was produced by Mike Leander and staged by Peter Sullivan and Reg Guest.\\" Here, the word \\"staged\\" is used, which suggests that Peter Sullivan and Reg Guest were responsible for arranging or orchestrating different aspects of the album. This could include coordinating the recording process, managing the studio environment, setting up the equipment, overseeing live performances or other related tasks. It implies that they played a significant role in ensuring that the various elements of the album were well-organized and executed for a successful final product. In the second sentence: \\"The album was produced by Mike Leander and directed by Peter Sullivan and Reg Guest.\\" The use of the word \\"directed\\" implies that the roles of Peter Sullivan and Reg Guest were more focused on creative decision-making and artistic direction.

Their role would be more focused on shaping the overall vision of the album and ensuring that the final product meets the standards they set. In summary, while both sentences convey that Mike Leander produced the album, and Peter Sullivan and Reg Guest contributed to its creation, the first sentence emphasizes their roles in organizing and orchestrating the album's production, while the second sentence highlights their involvement in the creative decision-making and artistic direction of the project.

There's a Swedish girl, a Danish, a German and a Chinese. The story contrives to get the clothes off all of them, involve them in some Carry On-type humour and couple them with various misfits from the British film and TV culture of the time, including Man About the House star Richard O'Sullivan, future Coronation Street rogue Johnny Briggs and horror film stalwart Ferdy Mayne (playing a sheik). There's a pretty risqué amount of female nudity on display, for those who like that kind of thing (but obviously nothing hardcore). Most of the film is pretty thin and inconsequential; the girls are stereotypes, and German Anita especially suffers from some kind of infantalising disorder - she's a moron obsessed with colour TV who acts like a kind of uninhibited child & dresses to deliberately show her private parts; in another more serious film, she would be a psychiatric case. The most interesting section of the film involves the Swedish girl being taken to a club in London where some dodgy types are still trying to swing, being seduced by a middle-aged rocker, losing her virginity and realising that the scene is not for her. These sequences have some energy in them and point to a more intriguing film than we've ended up with, in which promiscuity and the dregs of the music business and upper classes live soulless and seedy lives (there's a fine turn by John Standing as an impotent public school roué).

The end is striking, as Mayne's sheik for no earthly reason (except they have to end the film somehow) whisks all of the girls away to his Arab kingdom for what looks to all the world like a future in the white slave trade, which they are all delighted about.

To provide a detailed and long answer, let's break down the information given in the text and elaborate on the context and implications. Dale Earnhardt Jr., a popular and successful professional race car driver in the NASCAR series is the main subject in the text. He is the son of the late Dale Earnhardt Sr., a NASCAR legend and seven-time champion. Continuing in his father's footsteps, Dale Earnhardt Jr. has made a name for himself in the world of NASCAR. The incident described in the text occurred at Darlington, South Carolina. Darlington is home to the historic Darlington Raceway, a prestigious and challenging racetrack built in 1950, known for its distinct egg-shaped design that has earned the nickname, \\"The Track Too Tough To Tame.\\" Due to the prominence and history of the racetrack, the Southern 500 is one of the most anticipated and popular races held at Darlington Raceway. On Friday, during a practice session, Dale Earnhardt Jr. damaged his primary car. Practice sessions are held to allow drivers to get a feel for the track, test out various car setups, and fine-tune their performance before the actual race takes place. Unfortunately, accidents can happen during these sessions as drivers push the limits to find the best setup for the race. As a result of the damage sustained to his primary car, Earnhardt Jr.'s team made the decision to use a backup car for the Southern 500 race on Sunday. In NASCAR, teams typically bring a backup car to each race event in case of incidents like this. Backup cars are designed and built to the same standards as a driver's primary car, but they can require adjustments and fine-tuning to perform at their best. This means Earnhardt Jr.'s team would need to work diligently and quickly to ensure the backup car is optimized for Sunday's race. In summary, this text is about a specific event in the sports world, more precisely in the NASCAR series, where Dale Earnhardt Jr. had an accident during a practice session and is now turning to a backup car for the Southern 500 race. This situation highlights the importance of having a backup car and a well-prepared team in the demanding world of motorsports."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Although some origins in 18th century Japan and 1830s Europe, comic books were first popularized in the United States during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, \\"Famous Funnies\\", was released in the United States in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term \\"comic book\\" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone.  - Catwoman (Selina Kyle) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly in association with the superhero Batman. The character was created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger, and she made her debut in \\"Batman\\" #1 (Spring 1940), in which she is known as \\"the Cat\\".

Sometimes shown dressed like Robin Hood, Green Arrow is an archer who uses his skills to fight crime in his home cities of Star City and Seattle, as well as alongside his fellow superheroes as a member of the Justice League. Though much less frequently used in modern stories, he also deploys a range of trick arrows with various special functions, such as glue, explosive-tipped, grappling hook, flash grenade, tear gas and even kryptonite arrows for use in a range of special situations. At the time of his debut, Green Arrow functioned in many ways as an archery-themed analogue of the very popular Batman character, but writers at DC subsequently developed him into a voice of progressivism very much distinct in character from Batman.  - DC Comics, Inc. is an American comic book publisher.

I had been expecting a lot from it, as I'm a huge fan of James Cameron (and not just since \\"Titanic\\", I might add), and his name in the credits I thought would be a guarantee of quality (Then again, he also wrote the leaden Strange Days..). But the thing failed miserably at grabbing my attention at any point of its almost two hours of duration. In all that time, it barely went beyond its two line synopsis, and I would be very hard pressed to try to figure out any kind of coherent plot out of all the mess of strands that went nowhere. On top of that, I don't think the acrobatics outdid even those of any regular \\"A-Team\\" episode.

How is \\"If it is agreed, then we will go for it.\\" said in Romanian?","output":"The phrase \\"If it is agreed, then we will go for it.\\" can be translated into Romanian as \\"Dacă se ajunge la un acord, atunci vom merge pe varianta aceasta.\\" Here's a breakdown of the translation: 1. \\"Dacă\\" - \\"If\\": This is a conjunction introducing a conditional clause. 2. \\"se ajunge\\" - \\"it is agreed\\": In Romanian, this is an impersonal construction with the verb \\"a ajunge\\" (to arrive, to reach), which takes on the meaning of \\"to agree\\" in this context. The reflexive pronoun \\"se\\" makes the construction impersonal.  3. \\"la un acord\\" - \\"to an agreement\\": This is a common way of expressing agreement in Romanian using the preposition \\"la\\" followed by the indefinite article \\"un\\" and the noun \\"acord,\\" which has the same meaning as the English word \\"agreement.\\" 4. \\"atunci\\" - \\"then\\": This word indicates a consequence or result following a condition, much like \\"then\\" does in English. 5. \\"vom merge\\" - \\"we will go\\": This is the Romanian future tense of the verb \\"a merge\\" (to go); \\"vom merge\\" means \\"we will go\\". 6. \\"pe varianta aceasta\\" - \\"for it\\" or \\"on this option\\": This phrase shows the choice that will be taken if the condition is met. \\"Pe\\" is a preposition meaning \\"on\\" or \\"for,\\" \\"varianta\\" is the noun for \\"option,\\" and \\"aceasta\\" is a demonstrative pronoun meaning \\"this.\\" Together, they can be translated as \\"for this option\\" or simply \\"for it\\" in a more general sense.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: The World Health Organization estimates that at least 81 million people across Africa are affected by some form of disability. As a result many grassroots activists, academics and artists are finding innovative ways to improve accessibility for people with disabilities, at both a local and international level. From the Accessible Guidebook to Ethiopia, to wheelchairs made especially for rough rural terrain, there are numerous examples of resourcefulness and audacity. BBC Africa spoke to eight of these change-makers - to find out what they are doing and why they were inspired to make a change. In 2002, singer Grace Jerry was on her way home from choir rehearsal when she was knocked down by a drunk driver and left with paralysis of the lower limbs. After the accident she says music took on a whole new dimension: \\"Today, it is more than just holding the microphone, it is my world, my platform and my voice.\\" Last year, she introduced President Obama at the Mandela Washington Fellowship Young African Leaders Initiative programme in the United States. \\"I had to hold back the tears when he walked up to me on stage and said some beautiful things about me and the work we are doing in Nigeria through [disability advocacy NGO] Inclusive Friends,\\" she remembers. Four years ago, the Ethiopian Center for Disability and Development published its Guide to Accessible Addis Ababa, reviewing the accessibility of different hotels, government buildings, restaurants and public spaces. \\"When we saw that it was really helpful for visitors as well as locals with disabilities, we thought 'Ok we have to scale up this project',\\" says programme director Retta Getachew. \\"We have six guides now and another that combines them all in one book, which is the Guide to Accessible Ethiopia.\\" When her daughter was born with disabilities, Shona McDonald says medical staff told her: \\"'Put her in a home, have another kid and move on' - that there was nothing that would really add value for her. And it was through my frustration and anger that I decided I wanted to prove them wrong.\\" Using her sculpting skills, she started designing mobility equipment and supports - with the help of the University of Cape Town's biomedical-engineering department. Now her company, Shonaquip, manufacturers everything from wheelchairs to posture supports, which can be easily assembled, fitted and maintained by local therapists and technicians all over Africa. Last year, Tlhokomelo Elena Sabole was crowned Miss Deaf Africa 2015. It was, she says, a dream come true: \\"Winning was so amazing. I have never been happy like that.\\" Growing up in Lesotho as a deaf person is not easy, she says. But she hopes to change attitudes towards non-hearing people, and wants to see access to information opened up - such as through sign language on TV and signing classes in schools. \\"My dream is to have my own business,\\" she says, \\"for example a salon where I can share my skills and work with other deaf girls.\\" When Kenneth Habaalu joined the APTERS organisation they were finding it difficult to identify children with disabilities in the community. \\"People didn't want others to know they had a disabled child at home,\\" he explains. \\"One mother told me she usually leaves her child in bed when she goes to the market. To help her sit, she said: 'I dig a hole outside the house and put the child in there.' To stand, she would tie the child to the tree with material. I think it's inhuman to do such things.\\" With limited resources, APTERS' team of eight (all of whom are disabled) use recycled paper and cardboard to make papier machÃ© chairs, standing frames and walking aids, as well as teaching blocks for physiotherapy. Victor Locoro has been working as a lecturer in the Faculty of Special Needs and Rehabilitation at Uganda's Kyambogo University for 20 years. As well as offering courses in community-based rehabilitation and disability studies, the faculty has its own Braille Production Unit. \\"At the moment it's on hold because one of the embosser machines needs serious repair,\\" says Mr Locoro, who lost his sight at the age of ten. \\"But we are able to produce small amounts of material for the students, and are in the process of replacing the machine so that we resume full production. This includes producing books in Braille for primary and secondary schools; ministries of education, science, technology and sports; as well as civil society organisations.\\" In September 2007, Tim Stones co-founded the South African Deaf Rugby Union (SADRU). But there was a problem, the union wasn't affiliated with the South African Rugby Union - and so wasn't recognised by World Rugby. That all changed in 2014, and the following August SADRU held its first official Deaf Rugby Test series - the first of its kind held on South African soil - against Deaf Rugby World Champions, Wales. Today, the union has around 90 deaf players. \\"However our numbers are steadily growing,\\" says Mr Stones, \\"especially now that we are forming provincial Deaf Rugby unions in each province of SA.\\" SADRU is also working with audiologists to conduct screenings in clubs and schools, to identity potential players - and undiagnosed hearing problems. In between studying for her Electrical Engineering Masters at Colombia, Kay Igwe, who was raised in America but whose parents are from Nigeria, has been busy making an accessible computer game that's powered by brain waves. \\"A lot of people are investing in gaming culture right now,\\" she explains, \\"but when someone has a neurodegenerative disease that impairs them from using any of their limbs or eye movements - or if they've suffered from a stroke or something that has left them paralysed - they cannot use a controller in the same way that someone who has those abilities can.\\" Her solution? To use electroencephalogram or EEG signals to connect the brain to a computer game, so that a person can control a player using their brain waves. This is part of BBC Africa's Living With Disability season. Find out more here.","output":"The World Health Organization says that at least 81 million people in Africa have some sort of disability. So there are people working really hard to make things better and easier for them. They're coming up with things like special wheelchairs and guide books to help those with disabilities. They're even making computer games that you can play with your brain! Just think of them like superheroes, but instead of capes and superpowers, they use their creativity and caring hearts to help others. Like a singer who uses her music to speak for disabled people. Or a mom who wasn't okay with doctors saying her daughter wouldn't do well just because she had disabilities. She made special equipment to help her, and now she's helping many others too! There's even a teacher who helps students by making books in Braille. These people are changing the world one step at a time.

A group of police cars, with sirens wailing, escort an ambulance to Los Alamos Memorial Hospital. They are carrying an unidentified 50-year old man with acid burns to the face. He is placed on a respirator because the toxic fumes from the acid have seared his lungs and thus compromised his ability to breathe. A Detective (Elias Koteas) attempts to speak with him, asking him to identify himself and wondering whether he is a part of a Satanic cult. He gets no reply. A nurse calls him to the front desk to take a telephone call from the receptionist in the lobby who reports that the man's daughter is asking about him. Hearing a sudden change in the beeping of his respirator, the nurse returns to the man's room and screams. The man has jumped out of his tenth floor window to his death, leaving only a note that reads: \\"I'm sory [sic] Abby\\".Two weeks earlier. Twelve-year-old Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is sitting alone in the snow-covered courtyard of his apartment building, singing to himself, until his mother (Cara Buono) calls him for dinner. Owen's parents are in the process of a nasty divorce, and Owen is often left to eat alone and amuse himself by playing alone in his room. One evening, he notices a girl (Chloë Grace Moretz) about his age and her father (Richard Jenkins) moving into the apartment next door to his. Oddly, she is wearing no shoes.The next day at school, Owen is picked on as usual by three older boys -- Kenny (Dylan Minnette) and his friends Mark (Jimmy 'Jax' Pinchak) and Donald (Nicolai Dorian). Out of fear, wimpy Owen doesn't fight back, even though they give him a wedgie, causing him to urinate on himself. That evening, as he sits in the courtyard rehearsing knife attacks on his tormentors, he notices the new girl, Abby, watching him. She's not very friendly and tells him right off that they can't be friends. Not long afterwards, her father walks through the courtyard. It is revealed to the viewers, and what Owen doesn't know, is that he is not Abby's... A:","output":"I will try my best to answer your questions regarding the film proposal for \\"Let Me In.\\"  1. \\"Owen travels with what?\\" In the movie, Owen doesn't travel in the traditional sense. However, he frequently spends his time in the snow-covered courtyard of his apartment building, where he eventually meets Abby. If you are referring to what he carries with him, he has a knife that he uses to practice self-defense against his bullies.  2. Movie Title: \\"Let Me In.\\" This title appears to be a reference to the relationship between Owen and Abby. At the beginning of their interactions, Abby is not very friendly towards Owen, even telling him that they can't be friends. However, as the story unfolds, Abby \\"lets Owen in\\" and they develop a close relationship, while dealing with their respective issues and mysteries surrounding Abby and her father. 3. Movie Plot: \\"Let Me In\\" follows the story of Owen, a 12-year-old boy who is often bullied at school and feels lonely due to his parents' divorcing. Abby, a mysterious girl around his age, moves in with her father next door to Owen's apartment, and despite an initially cold attitude, they eventually become closer. Abby is revealed to be a vampire. Her \\"father\\" commits murders to provide her with fresh human blood to survive. As their bond grows stronger, Owen learns more about Abby's secret. Meanwhile, Abby's \\"father\\" dies after a failed murder attempt, which leads to the involvement of the authorities. The movie also shows violence and retaliation, as Owen finds courage in standing up to his bullies with Abby's help, which reaches a pivotal moment in a climactic swimming pool scene, where Abby saves Owen from his tormentors. At the end of the film, Abby and Owen decide to leave the town together, setting the stage for their uncertain future. Owen hides Abby in a box while traveling by train, suggesting that he has taken over the \\"caretaker\\" role from Abby's deceased father figure. Overall, the movie combines elements of horror, coming-of-age story, and drama, focusing on the developing relationship between Owen and Abby amidst both supernatural and more conventional life challenges. In order to decide whether to invest in this film proposal, you should consider factors such as the target audience, the expected financial return, the potential for critical success, and your belief in the team handling the movie's production. The original film, \\"Let the Right One In,\\" is a Swedish film that has received considerable acclaim, which may also factor into your decision."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The park is about 30 miles (48 km) long from north to south, and its width varies from a maximum of about 12 miles (19 km) in the north to a minimum of about 1 mile (1.6 km) along a narrow corridor between the north and south, where the park widens again to about 4 to 5 miles (6 to 8 km).I-40, former U.S. Route 66, the BNSF Railway, and the Puerco River bisect the park generally east–west along a similar route. Adamana, a ghost town, is about 1 mile (1.6 km) west of the park along the BNSF tracks. Holbrook, about 26 miles (42 km) west of park headquarters along I-40, is the nearest city. Bisecting the park north–south is Park Road, which runs between I-40 near park headquarters on the north and U.S. Route 180 on the south. Historic Highway 180, an earlier alignment of the modern route, crosses the southern edge of the park. Like Route 66, it has deteriorated and is closed. Many unpaved maintenance roads, closed to the public, intersect Park Road at various points.The fee area of the park covers about 230 square miles (600 km2). The Navajo Nation borders the park on the north and northeast. State-owned land, federal land controlled by the Bureau of Land Management, and private land, much of it used for cattle ranching, adjoin the other borders. The park’s elevation above sea level varies from a low of 5,340 feet (1,630 m) along the Puerco River to a high of 6,230 feet (1,900 m) at Pilot Rock; the average elevation is about 5,400 feet (1,600 m). The terrain varies from gentle hills and major petrified wood deposits in the south to eroded badlands in the north.  Most of the park's intermittent streams—including Lithodendron Wash, Dead Wash, Ninemile Wash, and Dry Wash—empty into the Puerco River.

Composed mainly of keratinocytes (skin cells that produce the protein keratin), it also contains other cell types, such as melanocytes (cells producing melanin, the pigment responsible for skin color), Langerhans cells (immune response cells), and Merkel cells (touch receptor cells). The epidermis is further divided into several sublayers, including the stratum corneum (the outermost sublayer), stratum lucidum (thin translucent layer, present in palms and soles), stratum granulosum (containing cells with granules), stratum spinosum (spiny layer with cells bridged by desmosomes), and the stratum basale (the deepest sublayer, where new cells are produced). 2. Dermis: The dermis, located beneath the epidermis, is a thicker layer of connective tissue that provides support and structure to the skin. It contains fibroblasts (cells producing collagen and elastin fibers), blood vessels, nerves, hair follicles, sweat glands, and sebaceous glands (oil glands). The dermis can be further divided into two sublayers: the papillary dermis, which is the thinner, upper layer containing fine collagen and elastin fibers and dermal papillae (finger-like projections that interlock with the epidermis); and the reticular dermis, which is the deeper and thicker layer containing denser collagen and elastin fibers, as well as the majority of skin appendages (such as hair follicles and sweat glands). These two layers work together to protect the body from environmental factors, enable perspiration and temperature regulation, and provide sensation and elasticity to the skin."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To achieve a complete and cohesive makeup look, she would likely move on to the next step. Here is a possible scenario: 1. After applying makeup on her chin and lips, she would want to ensure her entire face has makeup applied evenly. 2. She might move on to applying makeup on her cheeks, such as blush or bronzer, to add some color and dimension to her face. 3. To further define her face, she could consider applying highlighter to the high points of her face, such as the tops of her cheekbones and the bridge of her nose. 4. Next, she could turn her attention to her eyes. She might begin with applying eyeshadow to her eyelids, choosing colors that complement her overall makeup look and enhance her natural eye color. 5. To further define her eyes, she could carefully apply eyeliner along her upper and lower lash lines. 6. To complete her eye makeup, she would apply mascara to her eyelashes, making them appear longer and more voluminous. After she has finished applying makeup to her entire face, the most logical next event would be for her to assess her finished makeup look and make any necessary touch-ups or adjustments.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: Everything you need to know about McCutcheon v. FEC Back in October, we wrote an explainer on McCutcheon v. FEC, the case of aggregate donor giving on which the Supreme Court ruled today. We're reposting it here. And you can read the full McCutcheon ruling here. So what's this case all about? Shaun McCutcheon is a conservative businessman from Alabama who likes to give money to political candidates and committees. He dished out thousands of dollars in donations last election cycle. He says he would have given more, if not for the law that says an individual can only donate a certain total amount each cycle to candidates and certain political committees. McCutcheon thinks the law is a violation of the First Amendment. The Republican National Committee, which joined McCutcheon in the case, agrees. From the perspective of the Federal Election Commission and those who favor tighter campaign finance restrictions, the limits are necessary to fight corruption. The Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg ) How much can individuals give under the current law? For the 2013-2014 cycle, individuals can give a total of 123,200 to candidates, national party committees and certain political committees, including a 48,600 limit on what individuals can give to candidates. There are also other limits. For example, an individual can only give 2,600 to a specific candidate for federal office, per election per cycle. While this case is focused on the aggregate limits, it's important keep all the limits in mind. (More on that in a moment.) (Chart via FEC Web site.) Why do these limits exist, anyway? Because of changes to the Federal Election Campaign Act in 1974 that instituted them and created the FEC, the body that oversees and enforces campaign finance regulations. The act was amended in the wake of violations in the Watergate scandal. President Richard Nixon speaks near Orlando, Fla. to the Associated Press Managing Editors annual meeting, Nov. 17, 1973. Nixon told the APME \\"I am not a crook.\\" (Associated Press) So if the aggregate limits are struck down, what will it mean? A couple of things. For one thing, wealthy donors who can afford to make many donations will have greater influence when it comes to donating to candidates directly. Under the current aggregate limit of 48,600, an individual can max out at 18 federal candidates per cycle. Think of how much more they could give in total if they maxed out at 50 candidates -- or even more. Secondly, as The Washington Post's Robert Barnes and Matea Gold explain, defenders of the limits worry that such a ruling could dramatically increase the power and size of joint fundraising committees, which harness the fundraising power of different political committees. For example, the Obama Victory Fund joined together the DNC and Obama campaign last election cycle. In addition, those who favor limits also worry that such a ruling could lead to doing away with all limits, including the individual limits mentioned above. It's worth noting that in the current environment, there are already entities called super PACs that are not subject to limits on how much money they can accept from donors. So what is the court going to decide? It's not clear. But it looks like Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. will be key in this case. It's less clear where they will come down, compared to the other conservatives justices, write Barnes and Gold. Chief Justice John Roberts.

She phones her friend Thelma (Geena Davis) and makes reference to a vacation they are about to take together where they will retreat to a friend's rural cabin for the weekend. Thelma is married to a moronic hothead named Darryl (Christopher McDonald), and she is too timid to even tell Darryl that she is going away for the weekend. Instead, she waits until Darryl leaves for work and then writes a note. Louise is unmarried, although she does have a boyfriend named Jimmy (Michael Madsen). Her relationship is not the type that she has to explain anything to Jimmy; it is clear that Louise is an independent and headstrong woman, while Thelma is passive and naive. Perhaps out of fear of being in the woods with no man around, Thelma brings along Darryl's handgun. Together, the two friends set out in Louise's 1966 Thunderbird convertible.Before they have reached their destination, Thelma wants to stop at a roadhouse and have a few drinks. Although Louise does not want to do this, she warily agrees, seeing as it is Thelma's vacation, too. While there, the two women meet a man named Harlan (Timothy Carhart), who takes an interest in Thelma and flirts with her all evening. After Thelma has had too much to drink, Harlan sneaks her away from Louise and takes her out to the dark parking lot, where he attempts to have sex with her. When Thelma protests, Harlan becomes violent and attempts to rape her. He is interrupted by Louise, who appears brandishing the gun. Harlan tries to explain that they were just having fun, Louise warns him that when a woman protests a man's sexual advances, \\"she isn't having any fun.\\" Although she is able to get Thelma safely away from Harlan, he claims that he wishes he had raped Thelma after all, and Louise immediately shoots him dead.

Context: \\"That's Glenn Miller,\\" my father said. \\"But it can't be.\\" He had the back of the hospital bed cranked upright, the lower lid of his left eye creeping up in a warning signal I'd learned to recognize as a child. My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up. The jam box sat on the rolling tray table and my father was working the remote as he talked, backing up my newly burned CD and letting it spin forward to play a few seconds of low fidelity trombone solo. \\"You know the tune, of course,\\" he said. \\"'King Porter Stomp.'\\" Those childhood years of listening to him play Glenn Miller on the console phonograph were finally paying off. \\"He muffed the notes the same way on the Victor version.\\" \\"So why can't it be Miller?\\" I asked. \\"He wouldn't have played with a rabble like that.\\" The backup musicians teetered on the edge of chaos, playing with an abandon somewhere between Dixieland and bebop. \\"They sound drunk.\\" My father had a major emotional investment in Miller. He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen. That signature sound of clarinet and four saxes was forever tied up for him with first love and the early, idealistic months of the war. But there was a better reason why it couldn't have been Miller playing that solo. If the date on the original recording was correct, he was supposed to have died three days earlier. The date was in India ink on a piece of surgical tape, stuck to the top of a spool of recording wire. The handwritten numerals had the hooks and day-first order of Europe: 18/12/44.

In this confessional age, TV, radio and print rely for much of their content on the sad stories of those 'victims' of life. The story goes something like this: There is the future 'victim' getting on with their quotidian activities and whoosh, they are whisked into a life of gambling, drugs, sex or junk food addiction. After years of struggle, they finally find redemption and become good people again. As in any good tale of redemption, there has to be a 'reason' for why our 'victim' fell off the rails.

Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Children are known to be very keen observers and once they are interested in something, it is very likely to stay with them for life. They tend to look at life through the eyes of the person they are close to or want to be like. If their role model is optimistic, there are more chances of them optimistic. The role model becomes their standard of measurement. Because they follow the actions of their role models so closely, children adopt the personality and attitude of their role models. Children learn to like or dislike certain things by _ the personality and attitude of the people they admire. One reason why children keep changing their answers to \\"what would you like to be when you grow up\\" is that they are influenced by individuals in a certain field. Children view the social relationships (family or public) mainly in the light of the importance these relationships hold in the life of their role models. Their expression of their feelings is many times a reflection of their role model's outlook. According to a study, around 56% of teenagers identified with the role models. Out of these, those having personal or direct contact with their role models had higher self-esteem and were better at academics compared to those who didn't. As such, children who have positive role models, have more self-confidence and are more optimistic about their future. They learn to handle themselves well in social settings and positively interact with those around them. Of course, children who have their parents as positive role models have a well-rounded outlook towards life. They find it easier to deal with the highs and lows of life because they have seen their parents do it before. They find a sense of stability and security knowing that they will overcome failures just like their parents before them. Besides, it becomes easier for parents to discipline and guide children. So it is no wonder why children who have parents as their role models have fewer behavioral issues. Question: According to the study, after direct contact with their role models,   _  . - there is a decrease in children's self-esteem - there are fewer children better at academics - children may have a strong desire to succeed - children may feel more optimistic about their future The answer to this question is:","output":"- children may feel more optimistic about their future"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Dan first noticed something was wrong when he was in his 20s. His scrotum started to get bigger, but when he went to the doctors, they kept telling him he just needed to lose weight. Even though Dan tried really hard to lose weight, his scrotum kept getting bigger and bigger. One day, Dan was watching a TV show on a channel called TLC. The show was about a man named Wesley Warren Jr., who had the same big-scrotum problem as Dan. From the show, Dan learned the name of his condition - scrotal lymphedema - and he realized that losing weight wouldn't fix his problem. Dan was very lucky because a really smart doctor named Dr. Joel Gelman had helped Wesley Warren Jr. by doing a special surgery to make his scrotum smaller. Dan thought that maybe Dr. Gelman could help him too. So, he contacted Dr. Gelman, and the kind doctor agreed to do the same surgery for Dan. Dr. Gelman and his team worked very hard for 14 hours to complete the surgery. Dan's family was so happy because the operation was a success!

It can greatly reduce the quality of life of those who suffer from it, often limiting their mobility and causing discomfort during daily activities. Helping someone with arthritis aims to alleviate their symptoms and improve their overall well-being. Here are some reasons why someone might want to help their arthritis: 1) To reduce pain: Arthritis can cause chronic pain, which can be debilitating and interfere with a person's ability to participate in everyday activities. By helping to manage arthritis, one can lessen the pain they experience, providing relief and enabling them to carry out their daily tasks with greater ease. 2) To increase mobility: Joint stiffness and swelling are common symptoms of arthritis, which can limit a person's range of motion. Helping with arthritis may improve joint flexibility and range of motion, allowing sufferers to move with less difficulty and discomfort. 3) To maintain or regain independence: People with arthritis may find it difficult to perform essential functions such as self-care, household chores, or even work-related tasks. Assisting in managing arthritis symptoms can help a person maintain their independence or regain lost abilities. 4) To improve overall quality of life: Reducing the limitations caused by arthritis can have a significant impact on a person's quality of life. Helping their arthritis may enable them to participate in hobbies or activities they once enjoyed but have been unable to partake in due to pain or stiffness. 5) To prevent or slow the progression: Taking steps to alleviate arthritis symptoms and address the underlying factors contributing to the condition may help prevent the arthritis from getting worse or could even slow its progression. In the context given, it appears that the individual was assisting with their dog's arthritis, hoping it might help them return to participating in agility events. While it's not one of the options mentioned, it could be considered a part of improving their dog's overall quality of life by allowing them to enjoy and partake in an activity they previously enjoyed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A woman is sexually assaulted by a group of degenerate men and systematically exacts her vicious revenge on each of them. The thing that sets this movie apart from those ones (although not very far) is that the sexual content is not glorified. There is full frontal nudity many times throughout the film, but not for a second is it ever sexy. Some of the rape scenes might seem a little extensive, but that's only because the movie is trying to strengthen the audience's need to see this woman seek revenge. This is a weak film, it has no other way to maintain interest other than manipulating our natural desire to see this woman get revenge on her attackers. I Spit On Your Grave is not the kind of movie that you expect to deliver a serious moral, but I was glad to see that, since it contained a significant amount of violence inflicted upon the female lead, it was not meant to pass off as a T&A film. B-movies are notorious for being driven by nudity and out of control adolescent sexuality, and while I Spit On You Grave is unmistakably a B-movie and contains more than its share of nudity, the nudity does not drive the plot. On the other hand, the only thing that drives the plot is an empty necessity for revenge against a group of rapists. These men are evolutionary drop-outs just like they were in the Gator Bait films, and the biggest challenge for the writers seems to have been to come up with new and exciting ways to kill them, but the reason the film can never be anything more than a meaningless B-movie is because it does not deliver a message of any kind, but instead it simply satisfies the audience's desire to see a bunch of rapists get exactly what they deserve.  The one problem that this leaves is that we have to sit through the sexual attacks. Oddly, the first half of the film is the part that contains the most nudity (although not by much), but it is by far the most painful to watch. We are even let down a little as we watch the woman obtain revenge since a couple of the deaths were so elaborate that they were obviously impossible (it seems like pure luck that the guy in the lake at the end felt such an overwhelming desire to hug the motor on the boat and press his genitalia against the propeller, staying that way while the woman yells some final words at him and pulls the cord), but again, this movie satisfies only the desire for revenge that the first half filled us with. (spoilers) You know that this is all the movie means to do, since it literally ends the minute the last guy is killed. The woman does not live happily ever after, she doesn't write her book, she doesn't leave and never return to that nightmare place, she just gets in the boat and motors around the lake while the movie simply stops in its tracks. But hey, what more did you expect? Oh, and did you read the tagline? If you decide to waste your time watching this, try and find any man getting broken or burned.

For the past four years, he has been trying to assemble the skeleton of a Brontosaurus but is missing one bone: the \\"intercostal clavicle\\". Adding to his stress is his impending marriage to the dour Alice Swallow and the need to impress Elizabeth Random, who is considering a million-dollar donation to his museum. The day before his wedding, David meets Susan Vance by chance on a golf course when she plays his ball. She is a free-spirited, somewhat scatterbrained young lady unfettered by logic. These qualities soon embroil David in several frustrating incidents. Susan's brother Mark has sent her a tame leopard named Baby from Brazil.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Cravings can be difficult to manage, especially during the first and second trimester.  If you catch yourself having sweet cravings on a regular basis, find healthy swaps to help you limit your overall sugar consumption.  Find some healthy swaps to help keep your diet more nutritious and moderate in calories.  Eating a higher calorie sweet treat on a regular or daily basis may be too many calories for you.  This could cause you to gain too much weight during your pregnancy. Go for fruit.  If you're craving something sweet after a meal, try settling that craving with a sweet piece of fruit.  Make sure to choose ripe fruit that has a sweet flavor.  Try:  bananas, pineapple, mango, peaches or berries. Have a cup of tea.  Another trick to satisfy a sweet craving is by having a cup of hot tea.  Pick a flavorful brand with natural sweetness - like orange cinnamon or chai - and add a drop or two of honey or agave syrup. Have some yogurt.  Stock up on some of your favorite yogurt flavors.  These are naturally sweet and with some added fruit, this can really satisfy your sweet tooth. Another way to manage your sweet cravings is by adding something sweet to your meals.  Tasting sweets during your meal can help decrease the desire to end your meal with a treat.  Try:  Adding sliced fruit or dried fruit on a salad.  Fruit pairs well with many lettuces and dressings and can add a sweet bite to your fresh salads. End your lunch with a piece of fruit.  Pack a piece of fruit with your lunch and eat this last.  Whether its a few grapes, a sliced apple or a fruit cup, ending your meal by eating your serving of fruit last leaves the sweet flavor in your mouth. Although pregnancy cravings are common, they are not a sign that you need any nutrients or specific foods.  Work on moving past and ignoring some of your cravings so that you can stick to your definition of moderation.  If you're having a very strong craving and can't move past it, indulge yourself.  However, if it's not an overly strong craving or you know you just had a small bowl of ice cream last night, consider moving past your craving. Try going for a short walk.  A little exercise is a great way to get your mind and eyes off of sweets that may be hanging around your house.  Walk for 10-15 minutes at a time and revisit your craving when you get home. Try calling a friend or family member to help distract you mentally from your craving.  You can also ask them to be your support and help you stick to your definition of moderation. If you have a baby on the way, there are probably plenty of things you can be doing around the house to get you, your family and your home ready for the new baby.  Distract yourself by going shopping for things you may need, looking online for a crib, or planning out your new nursery. If you're having significant sweet cravings, it can be difficult to manage them or stick to your definition of moderation if your pantry, refrigerator and freezer are full of sweets.  Limit how much you keep in your house so you're not so tempted.  If you notice that your cravings are getting worse or you're having difficulty managing them, consider cleaning out your kitchen to help you avoid overdoing it. First consider getting rid of highly processed processed sweets or those that are overly high in calories or fat.  Items like snack cakes, candy or fruit treats do not offer many health benefits and are overly processed. Keep some of those healthier snacks or sweets on hand.  Stock your kitchen with dark chocolate bars, fruit, or some of your homemade treats (like frozen, chocolate dipped bananas).","output":"This article provides tips on managing sweet cravings during pregnancy, such as making healthier swaps, adding sweet elements to meals, practicing moderation, engaging in physical and mental distractions, and maintaining a kitchen free of excessive temptations."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Seemingly uncertain of their ultimate destination, the two talk about their plans for the future. When their bus breaks down, the two acquire a car from a nearby garage. While Martin is driving, a tire blows. Matt struggles to change the tire and Martin comments on how he and Matt are both about the same height, and kicks Matt into the path of an oncoming truck, killing both him and the driver. Taking Matt's guitar and clothes, he walks away singing in a voice similar to Matt's.  Twenty years later, a successful FBI profiler, Illeana Scott, is summoned to help out the authorities in Montreal in apprehending a serial killer who assumes the identities of his victims,  enabling him to travel undetected across North America. Martin's mother Rebecca claims to have seen her son alive and well on a ferry to Quebec City, leading to the body believed to have belonged to him being exhumed for forensic examination, and he becomes the primary suspect. Illeana, who has difficulty adjusting to her new surroundings and is distrusted by her local colleagues, interviews art dealer James Costa, an eyewitness who saw Asher kill his last victim. Costa makes a drawing of the killer and the authorities manage to track down the man's apartment, only to find a decaying corpse chained up in the ceiling. Illeana goes to Rebecca's house to question her about her son, and while snooping around discovers a hidden passageway behind a cabinet that leads to a secret room used to house young Martin, an unwanted and unstable younger child whom Rebecca neglected and saw as inferior to her elder son, whom Martin ultimately killed out of jealousy.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the march that Kevin Maguire calls, \\"a heroic failure\\"? ?  Before the start of the Second World War, and the establishment of war-based industries, Jarvis's initiatives brought modest relief to Jarrow. By 1939, about 100 men were employed in a small furniture factory and up to a further 500 in various metal-based industries set up on the Palmer's site. Jarvis had acquired the obsolete liners Olympic and Berengaria, to be broken up at the yard. However, after their triumphant homecoming many of the marchers felt that their endeavour had failed. Con Whalen, who at his death in 2003 was the last survivor of those who marched the full distance, said that the march was \\"a waste of time\\", but added that he had enjoyed every step. His fellow marcher Guy Waller, on the 40th anniversary of the march in 1976, said that \\"[t]he march produced no immediate startling upsurge in employment in the town. It took the war to do that\\". These views are shared by most commentators and historians. The Daily Mirror columnist Kevin Maguire calls the march \\"a heroic failure\\", while Matt Dobson, in The Socialist, writes that \\"out of all the hunger marches its aims were the most diluted and it made the most modest gains\\". The historians Malcolm Pearce and Geoffrey Stewart provide a positive perspective, arguing that the Jarrow March \\"helped to shape [post-Second World War] perceptions of the 1930s\\", and thus paved the way to social reform.Perry observes that \\"the passage of time has transformed the Jarrow Crusade ... into a potent talisman with which many apparently seek association\\". Thus the Labour Party, which in 1936 shunned the march, later adopted it as \\"a badge of credibility\\". In 1950 the party featured the Jarrow banners on its election posters; the march then disappeared from view in an era of high employment, only to be invoked again when unemployment again became a political issue in the 1980s. In the late 20th century and beyond, Labour leaders—Michael Foot, Neil Kinnock, Tony Blair—have all associated themselves with the march. In October 1986, on the 50th anniversary, a group...

An integer is what sort of number????","output":"An integer is a type of number that belongs to the mathematical set of numbers that includes both positive and negative whole numbers, as well as zero. Integers can be represented on the number line and are a crucial component of fundamental mathematical concepts and operations. Integers can be classified into different categories based on their properties: 1. Positive Integers: These are the whole numbers greater than zero (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4,…). They are represented to the right of zero on the number line. 2. Negative Integers: These are the whole numbers less than zero (e.g., -1, -2, -3, -4,…). They are represented to the left of zero on the number line. 3. Zero: This is a neutral integer, neither positive nor negative. It serves as the dividing point between positive and negative integers on the number line. Integers are commonly used in various mathematical operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. When performing these operations with integers, certain rules need to be followed to ensure accurate results. These rules include: 1. Addition: - Adding two positive integers results in a positive integer. - Adding two negative integers results in a negative integer. - Adding a positive integer to a negative integer (or vice versa) involves finding the difference between their absolute values, and the result takes the sign of the integer with the larger absolute value. 2. Subtraction: - Subtracting an integer is the same as adding its opposite. For example, subtracting a positive integer is equivalent to adding its negative counterpart, and vice versa. 3. Multiplication and Division: - Multiplying or dividing two positive integers results in a positive integer. - Multiplying or dividing two negative integers also results in a positive integer. - Multiplying or dividing a positive integer by a negative integer (or vice versa) results in a negative integer. Integers are foundational elements in mathematics and are vital for understanding various mathematical concepts, such as number theory, algebra, and geometry. They are also used in practical applications, involving finance, the sciences, and even day-to-day life situations like counting objects, measuring temperature, or calculating a gain/loss.

But adding insult to injury for many a patient is having to hack through a veritable jungle of often-confusing paperwork to make health insurance claims. Dr. Val Jones is part of a practice in Virginia that has lowered its fees and quit taking insurance. Consumers' frustrations with health insurance paperwork are well-known. But it's also a frustrating tangle for doctors and their staffs. AC360° correspondent Tom Foreman has a report about one innovative practice that has decided to take on the insurance paperwork monster -- by completely avoiding it. Dr. Val Jones joined a small practice, DocTalker Family Medicine in Vienna, Virginia, where the doctors do not even take insurance. They charge a simple, relatively low fee for each service. That's it. The doctors at DocTalker grew tired of seeing patients struggle with baffling insurance paperwork while both their health and wealth were on the line. \\"They don't know why they're getting these questions asked,\\"  Jones said. \\"They don't know what the forms mean. And ... their compensation is dependent on it.\\" This innovation has been good news for Carol \\"Yogi\\" Yogan of McClain, Virginia. She said she broke her wrist ice skating, and her insurance company initially told her that her injury would not be covered. After persistent effort, she eventually convinced them otherwise. The company paid. But Yogan is certain without her dogged efforts, her claim would have been forever lost in the \\"paperwork jungle\\" of the insurance trade.  Watch Yogan's struggle with bureaucratic red tape ». Yogi Yogan has pretty much lost all faith in insurance companies. She has enough insurance to cover a catastrophic illness, but for routine care, she's now going to that nearby fee-for-service medical office where Jones works. \\"It's seamless,\\" Yogan said. She knows precisely what she is getting and what it costs. Jones does not believe the insurance industry set out to cultivate the paperwork jungle. She thinks it just grew over time. But now that it is there, she suspects they are making so much money off of it, that there is no real incentive to clear it up. Former insurance industry executive Wendell Potter agrees. He said one way insurers make money is by allowing confusion to reign. \\"And people often just give up,\\" Potter said, \\"and don't pursue payment when a claim has been denied or been paid inappropriately or not adequately. And the same is true with doctors and hospitals.\\" He believes billions of dollars are at stake. The insurance industry, while acknowledging the existence of the paperwork jungle, denies it is a trap for extra profits. Robert Zirkilbach is with a national trade association for insurers called America's Health Insurance Plans. \\"The health insurance industry is one of the most regulated industries in America, and particularly at the state level there are all kinds of requirements of information that needs to be provided to patients in paper and through the mail,\\" Zirkilbach said. But he adds, insurers are just as worried as customers about the confusion that causes. \\"We agree that reform is needed. In fact, that's why we've been working very hard to develop reforms to make the system more efficient,\\" Zirkilbach said. AC360° correspondent Tom Foreman contributed to this report.

Myriel then reminds Valjean that he is to become a new man. Nine years later, Valjean is now a wealthy industrialist and a mayor. Fantine, a single mother working at one of Valjean's factories, is fired from when her manager learns she has had a daughter out of wedlock. However, Valjean is preoccupied with the arrival of Inspector Javert, who previously served as a guard at the prison in which Valjean was held. Fantine, in desperate need of money to pay the extortionate demands of the ThÃ©nardiers for looking after her daughter Cosette, turns to prostitution. Javert starts to suspect that the Mayor and Valjean are the same person. Fantine is attacked by some customers, and when she retaliates, Javert beats and arrests her, planning on sending her to prison. Citing his authority to do so as mayor, Valjean insists on her release and she is let go. Valjean nurses Fantine back to health, and promises her that she will have her daughter back. However, the ThÃ©nardiers continue to extort more money from Valjean and Fantine on the pretence of Fantine's daughter being ill. Later, Valjean receives word that another man is mistaken as being him and is about to be arrested. Valjean arrives at court where the man is being tried and reveals his identity that he is the real Valjean. Valjean then returns home and finds Fantine at death's door. Before she dies, Valjean promises Fantine that he will raise her daughter as his own. Javert arrives at Valjean's home... My question: Who helps the family reunite? A:","output":"In the plot of Les Misérables, Jean Valjean is the one who helps the family reunite.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: How were the special controllers connected to the NES?  A: On the NES, these special controllers were generally connected to one of the two control ports on the front of the console.  Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"A: The answer provided is a brief explanation of how the special controllers were connected to the NES. However, a more detailed answer would provide more information about the control ports, types of special controllers, and how they functioned with the NES. The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) featured two controller ports on the front of the console, allowing for the connection of standard controllers as well as various special controllers. The standard controllers were rectangular with a directional pad (D-pad), four face buttons (A, B, Start, and Select), and two shoulder buttons (L and R). In addition to the standard controllers, there were several special controllers and peripherals that gamers could use to enhance their gaming experience. These special controllers were connected through the same control ports used for the standard controllers on the front of the NES console. The controllers used a 7-pin connector cable that allows communication between the controller and the console by transferring data in the form of electrical signals. Some of the most notable special controllers for the NES include: 1. Zapper: The NES Zapper is a light gun that players could use for various shooting games like Duck Hunt and Hogan's Alley. Gamers would point the Zapper at the screen and pull the trigger to shoot, and the console would detect where the Zapper was aiming based on the light emitted by the television screen. 2. R.O.B. (Robotic Operating Buddy): R.O.B. is a robot accessory designed to interact with certain games, acting as a second player. It responded to specific patterns of screen flashes, and it could manipulate a controller or other physical objects through various attachments. 3. Power Pad: The Power Pad (also known as the Family Trainer in Japan) is a floor mat with twelve pressure-sensitive input buttons designed for exercise and sports-themed games. Players could run, jump, or step on the Power Pad to input commands for games like World Class Track Meet or Dance Aerobics. 4. NES Advantage: The NES Advantage is an arcade-style joystick controller for the NES that provided players with features such as turbo and adjustable rapid-fire capabilities, useful for shooting and fighting games. 5. NES Max: Similar to the Advantage, the NES Max is a controller designed for rapid and precise button inputs. It replaced the D-pad with a \\"circular pad\\" that allowed more fluid input and gave players turbo functionality on A and B buttons. To use any of these special controllers, players would simply need to connect the 7-pin connector cable to one of the available control ports on the front of the NES console. Once connected, the console would detect the peripheral, and the games would respond according to the inputs made on the special controller. In conclusion, the special controllers for the NES were connected to the console using the two control ports available on the front of the system. These controllers worked alongside the standard controllers to provide a more immersive gaming experience with unique gameplay mechanics. Each special controller had its own distinctive features and capabilities, further enhancing the versatility of the Nintendo Entertainment System."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Once the meditator achieves a strong and powerful concentration (jhāna, Sanskrit ध्यान dhyāna), his mind is ready to penetrate and gain insight (vipassanā) into the ultimate nature of reality, eventually obtaining release from all suffering. The cultivation of mindfulness is essential to mental concentration, which is needed to achieve insight. Question: What is the term when the mind is ready to penetrate and gain insight?","output":"The term used when the mind is ready to penetrate and gain insight is \\"Vipassanā\\" (Pali) or \\"Vipaśyanā\\" (Sanskrit). It refers to a profound and transformative meditative practice that involves keen observation, contemplation, and deep understanding of the ultimate nature of reality. Vipassanā meditation, also known as \\"insight meditation,\\" is an essential component of the Buddhist path to liberation from suffering, ignorance, and the cycle of rebirth (samsara). The process of achieving Vipassanā begins with the cultivation of mindfulness and mental concentration through various meditative practices, such as shamatha or calming meditation, loving-kindness (metta) meditation, and mindfulness of breathing (anapanasati). As the practitioner gains in concentration, the mind becomes more stable, focused, and less distracted by thoughts and emotions. Once the meditator achieves a strong and powerful concentration, called jhāna (Pali, Sanskrit ध्यान dhyāna), their mind is considered to be ripe or ready for the development of insight. In this state, the mind is not only focused but also equanimous, serene, and free from the five hindrances: sensual desire, ill-will, sloth and torpor, restlessness and worry, and doubt. The elimination of these hindrances can create the ideal conditions for Vipassanā meditation. During Vipassanā meditation, the practitioner carefully observes and investigates various aspects of their experience, such as bodily sensations, feelings, mental states, and phenomena. They gain a clear and direct understanding of the three universal marks of existence, namely impermanence (anicca), unsatisfactoriness or suffering (dukkha), and non-self (anatta). By intuitively comprehending these truths through direct experience, the meditator gradually dismantles the delusion of a separate and permanent self, which lies at the root of suffering and ignorance. As the practitioner's insight deepens, they acquire wisdom (pañña) and develop the ability to cut through defilements (kleshas) such as craving, aversion, and ignorance. This progressive process of inner transformation can culminate in the attainment of various stages of enlightenment (magga), eventually leading to Nirvana, the ultimate liberation from suffering and the unconditioned state of ultimate reality. In conclusion, Vipassanā is the term used when the mind is ready to penetrate and gain insight into the ultimate nature of reality. It is achieved through the prior cultivation of a strong and powerful concentration (jhāna) and is a crucial aspect of the path towards liberation and the end of suffering in Buddhist practice."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Arches board said there was \\"no other choice\\" after Glasgow Licensing Board's decision hit revenue by over 50%, making the  business \\"untenable\\". The licensing board imposed a midnight closing time after police complaints about drug and alcohol incidents. The move was opposed by almost 40,000 people in an online petition and 400 arts figures in a letter of protest. A statement from the Arches said: \\"Following a meeting of The Arches board of directors, and having taken due legal advice, the decision was taken today to start the process of appointing administrators for both Arches Theatre and Arches Retail Company Limited. \\"This follows last month's decision by the Glasgow Licensing Board to curtail the licensed hours of the leading multi-arts venue, effectively preventing the organisation from continuing its very successful and popular programme of club nights. \\"Without the income generated by this strand of activity, which generated over 50% of the companies' annual turnover, The Arches' business model is untenable.\\" The nightclub's licence was restricted to midnight by the licensing board. It had previously been allowed to stay open until 03:00. Gordon Kennedy, chairman of the board of directors, said the decision was taken with \\"deep regret\\", but said they had been left with \\"no other choice\\". Mr Kennedy also thanked those who had supported the campaign to reinstate the venue's licence, and said he had been \\"humbled by the hundreds of artists and industry professionals from all disciplines who have lent their signature and their voice to the cause\\". He continued: \\"Our hope is that the administrators, working with partners and stakeholders, can salvage some of the activities for which The Arches is renowned.\\" The company's executive director Mark Anderson added: \\"We would like to gratefully acknowledge the invaluable contributions made by all staff, board, artists and partners over the years. \\"We offer heartfelt thanks to our loyal customers who supported us throughout the years and were instrumental in making The Arches the iconic venue that it will always remain.\\" A Glasgow City Council spokesman said: \\"We have been working with the Arches and other funders for some time to develop a sustainable model to provide a long term financial solution for the Arches to continue to operate. \\"We remain committed to trying to identify opportunities for their work to go on.\\" Meanwhile a spokesman for Glasgow City Council's licensing board said the decision had come following evidence of \\"over 200 drug-related incidents detailed at the most recent hearing, as well as numerous call-outs to the ambulance service, which often related to people in life threatening situations\\". A statement from the board said: \\"The continued operation of the Arches' late-hours licence threatened public safety, created a risk of crime and endangered the health of individuals. \\"Unfortunately the conditions the Arches agreed to following the death of one of their customers did not curtail problems at the venue and the board had no option but to take further action. \\"The financial situation of a premises can never be a factor in the decision making process of the board.\\" Chief Supt Andy Bates, Police Scotland's divisional commander for Greater Glasgow, said: \\"Our primary role was to protect and ensure public safety and in our view the frequency and volume of incidents that were occurring at the Arches nightclub would have resulted in fatal consequences had we not acted. \\"We remain committed to supporting and working with the licensing industry across Glasgow and Scotland to ensure a safe environment for the public.\\" On its website, the company said that all events scheduled at the Arches from Wednesday onwards would now be cancelled. Scottish Green MSP Patrick Harvie said the loss of the venue was \\"entirely avoidable\\". \\"I'm disappointed that the city council decided to force The Arches into this position, and I'm surprised that despite the wave of public support not one other Glasgow MSP saw fit to support my call for a rethink. \\"It remains open to Glasgow, to the Scottish government, and to the arts community to try and find a new life for this important venue.\\" Last month, more than 400 cultural figures - including Makar Liz Lochhead, novelist Irvine Welsh and members of Mogwai, Belle & Sebastian and Franz Ferdinand - signed a letter criticising the licensing board's decision. The letter stated: \\"The Arches' importance to the future of the cultural life of Scotland cannot be overstated, and yet this latest decision leaves it in an extremely compromised situation, the cultural ramifications of which are huge.\\" The online petition, which reached 39,239 signatures, claimed the loss of the nightclub licence would endanger the city's arts scene and economy. It also accused the police of \\"harassment\\". Shortly after the news was announced \\"The Arches\\" began trending on twitter. The Arches thanked Glasgow City Council for their support over the years tweeting: \\"THANK YOU @CreativeScots  @GlasgowCC, all our staff & artists, and all of YOU for 25 years of support. #TeamArches\\" Underground house DJ Bontan, who had previously headlined at the Arches, tweeted: \\"Absolutely gutted about The Arches. Ran by some of the soundest people you're likely to meet & an amazing venue.\\" Summary:","output":"Glasgow's iconic venue, The Arches, is forced to appoint administrators due to the Glasgow Licensing Board's decision to impose a midnight closing time, which resulted in a 50% loss of revenue and made the business untenable."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What will Austin want to do next?  Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context?  A: Buy the video game  B: make people better  C: become a nurse Answer:","output":"B: Make people better According to the context provided, Austin played a doctor in the virtual video game world with the purpose of saving sick players. This shows that Austin has an interest in helping others, particularly in the context of healthcare within the game. Therefore, it would make the most sense for Austin to continue this passion of making people better and expanding their skills within the game. While options A and C could potentially be related to the overall context, they do not directly connect to Austin's role as a doctor in the virtual video game world. Buying the video game (Option A) is not relevant to the question of what Austin would want to do next, as they have already played the game as a doctor. Additionally, becoming a nurse (Option C) might seem like another potential healthcare role but it actually represents a different focus and scope of practice compared to the doctor role Austin has already played.

A key component common to all CPUs is the program counter, a special memory cell (a register) that keeps track of which location in memory the next instruction is to be read from. What is a component that all CPUs have?","output":"A component that all CPUs (Central Processing Units) have is the program counter. The program counter is a special type of memory cell, known as a register, that keeps track of the location in memory from which the next instruction is to be read. It plays a vital role in the operation of the CPU, as it helps manage the flow of instructions and ensures that they are executed in the correct sequence. The program counter is incremented after the execution of each instruction, pointing to the next instruction location in memory. This process enables the CPU to fetch and decode instructions in a sequential manner, which is crucial for the proper execution of programs stored in memory. In addition to the program counter, CPUs also contain several other components, such as the ALU (Arithmetic and Logic Unit), which performs arithmetic and logical operations; registers, which store temporary data or instruction information; and the control unit, which manages the entire process of fetching, decoding, and executing instructions by coordinating the activity of other components within the CPU. Overall, the program counter is a key component found in all CPUs, enabling them to manage instruction flow and execute programs stored in memory accurately and efficiently."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The DUP Finance Minister Arlene Foster is to present spending plans to the Executive, on the basis that welfare reform has already been agreed. The phantom budget will include cuts, but not the £600m cuts the DUP argued is needed if there is no welfare deal. The secretary of state told the programme that with or without welfare reform, Northern Ireland Executive ministers were facing other financial pressures on public services and had to make spending decisions. \\"These questions in relation to the budget have to be answered... regardless of outcome on welfare reform because there are around £200m of in-year pressures on spending in the Executive which are separate to welfare,\\" Ms Villiers said. \\"So I did actually urge all the parties to work on the budget questions. This work has to be done regardless of whether the welfare question is settled, so I would urge parties to keep working on the budget on the basis that Minister Foster is putting it forward.\\" While she welcomed the DUP's plan, Ms Villiers said it was a \\"step forward in some ways but of course, it is not a whole solution\\". She warned that time is running out for the parties to reach agreement on welfare payments. \\"I want to be very clear - it is crucial that the five parties in the Executive find way to resolve welfare question and of course, I believe it is crucial that Sinn Féin and SDLP live up to the agreement that was made at Stormont House.\\" Asked if there was a cut-off point for allowing the five parties to reach at deal before Westminster steps in, Ms Villiers said: \\"We all know the clock is ticking. \\"It's clear that if there isn't an agreed workable budget by around the middle of June then almost inevitably the emergency provisions on the budget come into effect for the Northern Ireland Executive by the end of July. \\"The impact on frontline services could be felt pretty soon thereafter.\\" She warned that public services would be \\"deeply damaged\\" unless Northern Ireland parties accepted \\"financial reality\\" and their own responsibilities.

What novel by Ray Bradbury was named for the temperature at which book paper catches fire and burns?","output":"The novel by Ray Bradbury that was named for the temperature at which book paper catches fire and burns is \\"Fahrenheit 451.\\" Published in 1953, Fahrenheit 451 is a dystopian science fiction novel that explores a future society where books are banned, and \\"firemen\\" are tasked with burning any books they find to suppress dissenting ideas and maintain government control over information. Fahrenheit 451 is set in an unnamed American city in a future that seems both distant yet disturbingly relatable. The protagonist of the story, Guy Montag, is a fireman who spends his days destroying books as his job. The title, \\"Fahrenheit 451,\\" refers to the temperature at which paper is believed to ignite, marking it the perfect name for a novel centered around the burning of books. The story begins with Montag meeting a young woman named Clarisse McClellan, who challenges his worldview and forces him to confront his own values. Consequently, Montag starts questioning the regime and its ban on books. He becomes increasingly curious about the world of literature and begins hoarding books in his own home. His wife, Mildred, reports him to the authorities, leading to a series of events that force Montag to confront his role in perpetuating the oppressive regime. Fahrenheit 451 serves as a powerful critique of government censorship, conformity, and the suppression of intellectual freedom. It is all the more relevant in today's digital world, where information is increasingly controlled, and individual privacy and freedom of expression are continuously challenged. The novel argues for the importance of diverse ideas and perspectives and warns against the dangers of a society where independent thought is stifled. The book became an immediate success upon its release, earning critical acclaim and a large readership. Since its publication, Fahrenheit 451 has been widely studied in both high school and college curricula and has been adapted into various media forms, including a 1966 film directed by François Truffaut, a 2018 film directed by Ramin Bahrani, and a graphic novel adapted by Tim Hamilton. In conclusion, Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is a groundbreaking and timeless piece of literature that poses essential questions about government control, censorship, and the importance of intellectual freedom. With its powerful portrayal of a world in which books are burned to suppress different ideas, it serves as a valuable reminder of the need to protect and value artistic expression and free thought."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Before you endorse the check, make sure it's one that your bank will accept, and that all the information on the front is correct. If the person who gave you the check spelled your name wrong or made a mistake, you may want to give it back to them and have them write you another check.  While some banks will accept a check that has been changed as long as the person who wrote the check initials the change, many banks are suspicious of this. It's better to have the person write you another check. A valid check has a line at the bottom with the routing number and account number. If that line isn't present, the bank will not be able to process the check. If only your name is listed on the payee line of the check, your signature is all that is needed to cash or deposit the check. If someone's else name is also listed, they only have to sign the check if the word \\"and\\" or the symbol \\"&\\" appears between the 2 names.  The default rule is that a check with 2 or more names can be cashed or deposited individually by any of the people listed on the check. If the check says \\"or,\\" or includes ambiguous language or symbols (such as a dash or a slash), either of the people named can cash or deposit the check. If the check is written to you \\"℅\\" (meaning \\"care of\\") someone else, only your signature is needed. They generally cannot cash or deposit the check without your signature. However, if you have a joint bank account, they may be able to deposit the check in that account on your behalf without your signature. If you flip over the check, you'll see 3 to 5 gray lines. These typically appear on the upper short side of the check. You'll also see a solid line with instructions not to write below the line. The bank needs the remaining blank space under the endorsement area to document the processing of the check. Make sure your signature doesn't extend into that space, or the bank may refuse the check. To endorse a check, you typically only have to sign your name in pen using blue or black ink. If your name on the check differs from your name on your government-issued photo ID, or on your bank account, you may want to print the correct spelling of your name under your signature. If you're signing a business check, include the business's name on the line above your name. You may also want to add your job title to show you are authorized to cash or deposit the check in the name of the company. Once you've signed the check, it becomes a \\"bearer instrument,\\" meaning anyone who finds it can cash it. If you're traveling to the bank, don't sign your check until you get there.  If you go to a bank to cash the check and you don't have an account with that bank, you typically must show a government-issued photo ID. You may also have to provide a thumbprint for identification services. Check cashing services will charge you a fee to cash the check. Banks typically charge a fee as well, unless you have an account with that bank. If you don't have a bank account, you may want to take this opportunity to open one, using the check is your initial balance. Otherwise, you can get the check cashed at a check-cashing service available at discount or grocery stores. You can also go to the bank that issued the check.

Q:Few athletes would disagree that more muscle is an advantage in their sport. And protein is the perfect source of amino acid building blocks needed for new muscle growth and repair. Taken together, strength training and sufficient protein will stimulate new muscle protein synthesis. Note that the keyword here is sufficient, because this is where protein supplement marketers like to extend to “the more the better”. So how much protein do sportspeople need? Consensus position statements such as those produced by the American College of Sports Medicine give the range of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. But the top end of that range is for elite endurance athletes, power sportspeople and those in the early stages of a strength training phase. The “recreational athlete”, which describes the majority of active sportspeople, should aim for the bottom end of the range. So how do those protein requirement numbers stack up against a regular diet? Protein intake and body weights collected in the 2011-2012 Australian Health Survey, as an example, show the average Australian male already eats 1.2 grams and the average female 1.1 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And this is for mostly sedentary people who are not following any special “high protein” training diet. Sportspeople do have higher energy needs. But by simply eating a greater volume of food with a focus on higher protein content, it’s very feasible for an athlete to get their protein requirements from food alone. This has been backed up by research; numerous dietary surveys show the normal diet of strength-based athletes provides around two grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. And that’s before using any protein powders. But protein supplements can’t be dismissed altogether. There are circumstances where supplementation is an appropriate and convenient option for athletes, such as when travelling, or during an intense training schedule. How long should athletes probably eat protein? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - All the time - even when they aren't working out - Only after working out - not enough information - Only before working out A:","output":"Not enough information"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Despite the inclusion of this additional descriptor, the core statement remains unchanged, which is that there are two ladies standing on the sidewalk. The difference between the two statements lies in the level of detail provided about the ladies. The first statement simply describes the physical presence of the two ladies on the sidewalk, while the second statement adds information about their emotional state, indicating that they are sad. However, this added detail does not alter the fact that there are two ladies standing on the sidewalk. The presence of the adjective \\"sad\\" could be considered irrelevant to the core fact being presented, which is the presence of two ladies on the sidewalk.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: time lapse of tourists visiting brandenburg gate in a sunny day","output":"In the sentence \\"time lapse of tourists visiting Brandenburg Gate in a sunny day,\\" the most important words are: 1. Time lapse: This phrase indicates that the main focus of the sentence is a sped-up video or animation of a certain event or location. A time lapse captures many images or frames over a period and then condenses them into a shorter sequence, allowing the viewer to witness events that would typically take a long time in a matter of seconds or minutes. 2. Tourists: This word emphasizes the people involved in the scene being described. It tells us that the time lapse specifically features a group of visitors or travelers, likely making the content more dynamic and engaging. The presence of tourists might suggest that the location is a popular and notable landmark. 3. Brandenburg Gate: Referring to an iconic historic monument in Berlin, Germany, this word identifies the specific location of the scene. As an important symbol of the city and a famous tourist attraction, the Brandenburg Gate holds cultural and historical significance, making it a critical component of the sentence. 4. Sunny day: This phrase describes the desirable weather conditions during the recording of the time lapse. The words 'sunny day' imply pleasant light, warmth, and visibility, potentially making the time lapse more attractive and visually appealing. Furthermore, a sunny day can also contribute to creating a positive and welcoming atmosphere for the tourists visiting the Brandenburg Gate. Overall, \\"time lapse,\\" \\"tourists,\\" \\"Brandenburg Gate,\\" and \\"sunny day\\" are the most vital words in the sentence as they define the primary focus of the content, the people involved, the specific location, and the setting or context in which the scene takes place."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Make sure the pieces are very small, about 0.5 cm long or smaller. When the vegetables are cut, check on the cream cheese to see if it's soft enough. Answer:","output":"iii. You may have to wait a few more minutes for the cream cheese to be ready. Dice the peppers, tomatoes, and olives. After softening the cream cheese, it is natural to progress to preparing the vegetables that will be added to the Halloween taco dip. While waiting for the cream cheese to reach the desired consistency, you can use the time to dice the peppers, tomatoes, and olives. This ensures that all your ingredients are ready for assembly once the cream cheese is softened. Here's a more detailed elaboration on how to make halloween taco dip: 1. Soften the cream cheese: Allow the cream cheese to come to room temperature so that it is easier to spread and mix with other ingredients. If you're in a hurry, you can soften it in the microwave using a microwave-safe bowl at intervals of 10-15 seconds, checking and stirring in between until softened to your liking. 2. Dice the vegetables: While waiting for the cream cheese to soften, wash and dice the peppers, tomatoes, and olives into small, even pieces, approximately 0.5 cm long or smaller. If you prefer, you can also add other ingredients to your dip, such as onions, scallions, or even corn. 3. Combine the ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, mix the softened cream cheese with sour cream or mayonnaise (or a combination of both) until smooth. You can also add taco seasoning to the mix for an extra punch of flavor. Once the base is smooth, gently fold in the diced peppers, tomatoes, and olives until evenly distributed. 4. Assemble the layers: In a deep, glass serving dish or a disposable aluminum pan, spread a layer of the cream cheese mixture evenly across the bottom.

The techniques make farming possible in places where there is not enough water. Because of this, he won this year's World Food Prize. Hillel is using the techniques in his orchards   near his home in Israel. Irrigating drop by drop -- called drip irrigation -- has changed agriculture by greatly reducing the amount of water needed. Farmers now rely on it in places from Spain, to Africa, to America. \\"We in California grow about 50 percent of the fruits and vegetables of the continental United States,\\" says Jan Hopmans from University of California at Davis. \\"And these drip irrigation techniques make it possible.\\" Hillel got his start in dry land farming in Israel's Negev Desert in the 1950s. \\"The key was making good use of water,\\" he says. \\"There's much land. Water is limited.\\" These farmers did not have the advantage of running irrigation water through channels   to their crops. So Hillel and others gave plants just what they needed and just where they needed it. \\"The idea is to use water little by little,\\" Hillel says. It worked so well that Hillel was soon traveling around the world, showing others how to do it. Experts say drip irrigation's importance is growing, as climate change and rising population make water supplies become few in many parts of the world. \\"This is where water use, climate change and crop production all meet at one point,\\" Hillel says. \\"And this has been really the essence   of my career.\\" A career whose importance can be measured drop by drop.

It removed the word \\"patience\\" from its regular statement. The language was seen as an indication that the central bank would refrain from raising rates for at least a few months. But the Fed said it would wait until it saw \\"further improvement\\" in the US labour market before raising rates. US shares rose sharply on the news. A delayed rate rise is good news for US companies, who will remain able to borrow cheaply for some time yet. That cheered investors, who pushed the Dow Jones higher by 0.9% or 159 points to 18,008, while the broader S&P 500 rose 1% to 2,096. Many market watchers had expected the Fed to signal on Wednesday that it would move towards a rate rise in June or September. However, in a statement released at the end of its two-day policy meeting in Washington, DC, the Federal Reserve warned that US economic growth had \\"moderated somewhat\\" since January. Fed officials added that it would \\"appropriate\\" to raise interest rates once there had been \\"further improvement in the labor market\\" and cautioned that \\"this change in the forward guidance does not indicate that the Committee has decided on the timing of the initial increase\\". The chair of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen, said in a press conference following the release of the statement that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) did \\"not want to rule out the possibility\\" of a rate rise, but any move would \\"depend on the committee's assessment if incoming information\\". \\"Just because we removed the word patient from the statement doesn't mean we're going to be impatient,\\" she added. A recent spate of disappointing US economic data, such as lower retail sales and consumer sentiment, has led some economist to call for a rate rise to be delayed even further. \\"The Fed is in no rush,\\" said Ward McCarthy, chief US economist at Jefferies. \\"At the current juncture, the timing of the liftoff is still indeterminate and will depend upon the inflation data. The policy statement eliminated the use of 'patient' in forward guidance, but the FOMC also described the new forward guidance as being \\"consistent\\" with the prior forward guidance.\\" He added: \\"The word 'patient' was removed, but the meaning of patient remained.\\" For investors this was billed as the biggest Federal Reserve policy meeting in years. The Fed under the leadership of Janet Yellen is trying to prepare the world for the first US rate hike in nearly a decade. By dropping the word patient from its statement, America's central bank signalled its intention to start gradually raising interest rates from their record lows. The world's largest economy is improving. Jobs are returning. But the recovery in the housing market is subdued. Exports have slowed as the value of the dollar has climbed. And wages remain stagnant. Ultra low rates are meant to encourage borrowing and spending to fuel growth. The Fed is now seeing that the recovery is looking strong enough to be able to support higher rates. But the exact timing...well that remains a mystery. The only certainty is that those higher rates won't come in April. As for any more clues? Ms Yellen refused to provide any hints during her press conference: \\"We can't provide certainty and shouldn't provide certainty because economic developments that will unfold are uncertain,\\" she said. What is a summary of this text?","output":"The big bank, called the Federal Reserve, helps control money in the United States. They decide when to make it easier or harder for people and businesses to borrow money. For a long time, they've made it super easy to borrow money to help the country grow.

It is surprising how few people really do this carefully. Once I arrived at he airport a few minutes after ten. My secretary had got the ticket for me and I thought she had said that the plane left at 10:50. When I arrived at the airport, the person at the departure desk told me that my flight was closed. Therefore, I had to wait three hours for the next one and missed an important meeting. The second rule is to remember that even in this age of credit cards  , it is still important to have some local money in cash  . Once I arrived at a place at midnight and the bank at the airport was closed. The only way to get to my hotel was by taxi but because I had no dollars, I offered to pay in pounds instead. \\"Listen! I only take real money!\\" the driver said angrily. You can imagine how terrible I felt at that moment.

Write a text based on \\"confusion over nigerian response to cup ban\\" Text:","output":"Title: Confusion Over Nigerian Response to Cup Ban In recent days, the Nigerian football community has experienced a whirlwind of emotions. The country's response to the recent ban imposed on its national team from participating in the African Cup of Nations (AFCON) has been mired in confusion, leaving football enthusiasts and administrators puzzled and seeking clarity on the situation. Step 1: Understanding the Background To provide a comprehensive overview of this issue, it's necessary to revisit the events leading to the ban. The Nigerian national team, also known as the Super Eagles, were accused of fielding an ineligible player in a crucial AFCON qualifier match. As a result, they suffered a point deduction and were subsequently prohibited from taking part in the competition. Step 2: Evaluating the Nigerian Response Following the announcement of the ban, the Nigerian Football Federation (NFF) appeared perplexed, which was evident in their lack of a coherent and unified response. While some NFF officials accepted the decision and promised to appeal, others refuted the claims, blaming the referee and match officials for the controversial outcome. Step 3: Assessing Public Reactions The confusion surrounding the Nigerian response has not only affected the football federation but also the entire nation. Fans and pundits have been eagerly following the developments and expressing their opinions on social media platforms. The uncertainty has led people to question the organization and competency of the NFF, as well as the integrity of the sport in the country. Step 4: Analyzing the Impact on Nigerian Football The AFCON ban has undoubtedly cast a shadow over Nigerian football, with negative implications for the sport's future in the country. The Super Eagles' absence from the prestigious tournament may have repercussions on the team's morale and confidence, potentially affecting their performances at both domestic and international levels. Furthermore, the fiasco has exposed weaknesses within the NFF and could possibly deter future sponsorships and partnerships. Step 5: Exploring Possible Solutions To remedy this situation and prevent similar incidents in the future, it is imperative that the NFF takes effective measures to streamline its decision-making processes and establish transparency in its actions. Implementing stricter guidelines for player eligibility, thorough record-keeping, and enhancing communication between team officials and players can help foster trust and prevent misunderstandings. In conclusion, the confusion over Nigeria's response to the AFCON ban has undoubtedly raised several concerns about the management and governance of Nigerian football. With the right corrective measures and commitment to transparency, it is hoped that the Super Eagles can soar high once again, making amends for this unfortunate setback and working towards a more promising future in the sport."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Professor Otto Lidenbrock followed Arne Saknussemm where?","output":"Professor Otto Lidenbrock followed Arne Saknussemm on a remarkable journey to the center of the Earth. This extraordinary adventure was first introduced in the 1864 science fiction novel \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" written by French author Jules Verne. In the story, the Icelandic alchemist and natural scientist Arne Saknussemm was said to have discovered a passage to the Earth's core in the 16th century. The journey began when Professor Lidenbrock, a German scientist, stumbled upon a coded message in an ancient manuscript written by Arne Saknussemm. The message insisted that Saknussemm had found a pathway to the Earth's center through the Snæfellsjökull volcano in Iceland. Upon discovering this, Professor Lidenbrock, his nephew Axel, and their Icelandic guide, Hans Belker, embarked on an expedition to follow in Saknussemm's footsteps. The trio commenced their expedition by traveling to Iceland and climbing the Snæfellsjökull volcano. Upon reaching the top, they discovered a crater with three vertical shafts, one of which was the entrance that Arne Saknussemm had indicated in his coded message. This particular shaft was only accessible during the days of June 25th to June 28th, as the specific angle of sunlight illuminated the correct passage during this time. The adventurers descended the volcanic tube, equipped with the necessary gear and provisions for their journey. They faced many challenges and wonders during their descent, including underground oceans, prehistoric forests, and giant caverns. Throughout the trip, they encountered various phenomena and creatures from the Earth's past, including giant insects, plesiosaurs, and a human-like creature referred to as the \\"Man of the Stone Age.\\" After a series of adventures and near-disasters, the trio eventually reached the Earth's core, witnessing a subterranean world filled with astonishing marvels. From there, they made their ascent back to the Earth's surface through an explosive volcanic eruption in the Stromboli volcano off the coast of Italy. In summary, Professor Otto Lidenbrock followed Arne Saknussemm on a fantastical journey to the center of the Earth, which took them through the Snæfellsjökull volcano in Iceland and led them to explore previously unknown realms deep beneath the Earth's surface. The thrilling account of their journey, as written by Jules Verne, remains an enduring classic in science fiction literature and continues to inspire readers and spark imaginations to this day."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

So when she finally walked out with shiny teeth,a sore mouth and a broken spirit,I told her I was proud of her and took her to Ben &Jerry's for an ice cream reward.Two weeks later,we returned to the scene of the crime.The dentist spent about 45 seconds checking her teeth before sending her on her merry way.Before I could start the car, she was placing her ice cream order.She was shocked when I told her that she wasn't going to get a reward every time we get her teeth checked. Clearly,she's not alone.According to some parenting experts,kids are easily addicted to a benefit--producing system of parental rewards and bribes--it's not all ice creams,candies and cool toys.Some parents are offering their children prizes to just let them sit down and behave in a restaurant--or sleep in their own beds--or score a goal in the next soccer game. While the experts agree that occasional awards are okay, the danger lies in the system's overuse.Kids quickly gain a sense of entitlement ,where they come to expect a big reward for every good thing that they do,no matter how small.To keep things in check,experts say parents should reduce the number of rewards they offer,make sure rewards match the behavior and explain the real benefits of behaving for the sake of behaving.

Confiding to his friend Michael Morgan (Ian Hendry) that Damien is the Antichrist, Bugenhagen attempts to convince him to give Damien's guardian a box containing the means to kill Damien. As Morgan is unconvinced, Bugenhagen takes him to some local ruins to see the mural of Yigael's Wall, which was said to have been drawn by one who saw the Devil and had visions of the Antichrist as he would appear from birth to death. Though Morgan believes him upon seeing an ancient depiction of the Antichrist with Damien's face, both he and Bugenhagen are buried alive as the tunnel collapses on them. Seven years later, the 12-year old Damien (Jonathan Scott-Taylor) is living with his uncle, industrialist Richard Thorn (William Holden) and his wife, Ann (Lee Grant).

George Frederic Watts was born in 1817, the son of a London musical instrument manufacturer. His two brothers died in 1823, and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and by his mid-teens was proficient enough as an artist to be earning a living as a portrait painter. At the age of 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. From 1837, Watts was successful enough to devote himself full-time to painting.In 1843 Watts travelled to Italy where he remained for four years. On his return to London he suffered from melancholia, and painted many notably gloomy works. His skills were widely celebrated, and in 1856 he decided to devote himself to portrait painting. His portraits were extremely highly regarded, and in 1867 he was elected to the Royal Academy, at the time the highest honour available to an artist, although he rapidly became disillusioned with its culture. From 1870 onwards he became widely renowned as a painter of allegorical and mythical subjects; by this time, he was one of the most highly regarded artists in the world. In 1881 he added a glass-roofed gallery to his home at Little Holland House, which was open to the public at weekends, further increasing his fame.

Board games have been played in most cultures and societies throughout history. Do you think of yourself as a bit of an expert at board games like chess or Go? Maybe you're not quite as good as you think. New research from the University of Manchester and Oxford suggests complex games like these are impossible to learn fully. They may even be too complex for the human mind to understand. Researchers studied two-player games, to try and understand the strategies which people use to make decisions during the game. Some games with two players are simple, with only a small number of possible moves. Players can quickly work out the best strategy but that means the game soon becomes boring. It gets more interesting when there are many possible moves. That's why people are so fascinated by complex board games like chess or Go, or some card games. But what the researchers found was that with difficult games, players find it hard to work out the best strategy and their actions become less reasonable. This research is part of the field called game theory: the study of human strategic decision-making. Much thinking on how people play complex games is based on something called \\"the balance point\\", which is when players have a perfect knowledge of what they are going to do and of what their rivals are going to do. When you add more than two players then of course the game becomes even harder to understand. Trading on the stock market is an example of a complex multi-player game.

A man who lives next door to the owner of the Washington Redskins football team, Daniel Snyder, has registered the name Washington Bravehearts, it was reported today. The trademark states the name is for use for 'entertainment in the nature of football games.' Aris Mardirossian first registered the trademark and launched 'Washington Brave Hearts LLC' on Oct. 17 according to TMZ. Scroll down for video. Name change? Washington Redskins owner Daniel Snyder, right, and his wife Tanya Snyder, left. The owner of the Redskins said that he was not planning to change the team name but his next door neighbor appears to have other ideas. Denial:. A spokesman for the Redkins denied the team were contemplating a name change. Change it: In an interview with the Associated Press yesterday, President Obama said if he were the owner of the Washington Redskins football team, he would change the name so as not to offend Native Americans. The filing has started rumors spreading that the Washington Redskins may be about to change its name. The wording used on the filing documents is similar to that used for the NFL's Seattle Seahawks and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. A spokesman for the Redkins denied the team were contemplating a name change. “There is no connection between the Washington Redskins and the trademark application,” said a team spokesman. “Dan Snyder does not know the man named in the story.” However, this appeared to be untrue. Rumors: Owner Daniel Snyder created a company called Washington Brave Hearts, LLC. Cheering them on: A view of the Washington Redskins cheerleaders during a game against the Dallas Cowboys at the Redskins Stadium in Landover, Maryland. Mr Snyder and Mr Mardirossian worked together in a lawsuit back in 2005. against the National Park Service in a fight to chop down trees in front. of their homes, in a request that was denied. Simply because a. trademark has been established doesn't necessarily mean the Redskins are. about to change their name, however the timing is interesting given the. recent controversy surrounding the racial aspect of the “Redskins” name. Earlier this month President Barack Obama weighed in on the. debate saying that if he owned the Washington Redskins, he would 'think. about changing' the team name. Chinese whispers: Maybe this is all smoke and no fire however SNyder's neighbor Mardirossian registered the domain WashingtonBravehearts.com on October 18. Obama, in an interview with The Associated Press, he said team names like the Redskins offend 'a sizable group of people.' He said that while fans get attached to the nicknames, nostalgia may not be a good enough reason to keep them in place. 'I don't want to detract from the wonderful Redskins fans that are here. They love their team and rightly so,' he said. But. the president appeared to come down on the side of those who have. sharply criticized the football team's name, noting that Indians 'feel. pretty strongly' about mascots and team names that depict negative. stereotypes about their heritage. Depictions: The Redskins players above are shown wearing helmets depicting the team's mascot - a Native American Indian. Sticking with it: Ten members of Congress sent a letter to the NFL commissioner last May, asking for the name to be changed. Owner Daniel Snyder said he would never change the name (pictured right) Other professional sports teams have. Indian nicknames, including football's Kansas City Chiefs and baseball's. Atlanta Braves and Cleveland Indians. Numerous colleges and universities have changed names that reference Native Americans. St. John's changed its mascot. from the Redmen to the Red Storm, Marquette is now the Golden Eagles. instead of the Warriors and Stanford switched from the Indians to the. Cardinal. The. Redskins' nickname has attracted a fresh round of controversy in recent. months, with local leaders in Washington calling for a name change and. some media outlets refraining from using the name. Protest: Those against the mascot and team. name plan protested in. Washington, D.C. earlier this month. Above, the team's mascot in 1995. The name is the subject of a. long-running legal challenge from a group of American Indians seeking to. block the team from having federal trademark protection. Congressional lawmakers have introduced a bill seeking the same goal, though it appears unlikely to pass. Team. owner Dan Snyder has vowed to never abandon the name. But NFL. Commissioner Roger Goodell said last month that the league should pay. attention to those offended by the nickname. Time for change? Snyder watches from the sidelines before a game against Detroit on September 22. Several other sports teams have changed their names in the past so as not to offend Native Americans. Despite the controversy, an AP-GfK poll conducted in April showed that nationally, 'Redskins' still enjoys wide support. Nearly. 4 in 5 Americans don't think the team should change its name, the. survey found. Only 11 percent think it should be changed, while 8. percent weren't sure and 2 percent didn't answer. Keep it: According to a poll conducted by the AP and GfK, four out of five Americans think the team should keep their name.

Summarize the following: If your dog is in pain it may struggle or bite while you try to treat its wound. If possible, have another family member or friend restrain your dog while you examine its injury. Be sure to handle your dog firmly but gently to avoid causing it extra pain.  To restrain your dog, kneel down by your dog's side so you're facing its head. Then, take your arm that's furthest from your dog and hook it under your dog's chin. Take your other arm and wrap it around your dog's chest, behind its front legs. Finally, pull your dog close to your body and hold it there. Restraining your dog may help to calm it down if it feels panicked by its injury. Even the most docile dog may bite its owner after suffering a disorienting injury. Before treating your dog's wound, muzzle it gently to prevent biting. Be sure that the muzzle does not touch the wound.  If your dog's wound is located too close to its mouth to muzzle it, proceed with caution. If you do not have a muzzle, you can wrap gauze around your dog's mouth temporarily to keep it from biting you. If your dog has a small wound, cover it with a clean piece of medical gauze. Apply constant pressure to the wound for up to 20 minutes to slow or stop the bleeding. If your dog has a large laceration, place a clean towel over the wound. If the bleeding continues after 20 minutes, bring your dog to a vet right away. Gently wrap a sports bandage or a long strand of soft material around your dog's head, limb, or torso to keep the gauze over the wound. Avoid wrapping it too tight, which may restrict your dog's breathing or circulation. Tie the bandage or material firmly with a knot. Avoid using tape to keep the bandage in place as it will adhere to your dog's fur and cause irritation and hair loss. If one of your dog's front or back paws is injured, you can slow down the bleeding by raising it above heart level. This will be the easiest to do if your dog is lying on its side, with the injured limb facing upwards. Keep gentle pressure on the wound. Similarly, if your dog has an ear injury and long ears, gently pull the ear up above its head to help stop the bleeding. Your dog may get an infection if its wound is left untreated for more than a day or two. Bring your dog to a veterinarian as soon as you can to evaluate and treat the injury. Your vet can also provide advice for how to care for the wound while it heals. Your vet may also have to check for internal bleeding, depending on the injury your dog suffered.","output":"When treating a dog's injury, have someone restrain the dog gently while you examine the wound.

Mostly the dying. It was the dying that interested me. I sat on a bench in a sort of waiting room. I wanted to call it a green room; it wasn't a place where the patients would wait to be called by the doctor; it was a place where the relatives would wait while the patient was in their room. It had a coffee bar, and comfortable couches, with trendy, muted colors on the walls and floor. Everything was clean and modern without being cold, a homogenized balancing act designed to keep everyone calm during their stressful time.

He is trying to see how to make chemical reactions within organism easier. To that end, he conducts two tests, test A an test B, on an organism. In test A he reduces catalysts from the organism, but in test B he induces catalysts in the organism. He needs to observe the outcomes of these tests.  But I can use this background: Most chemical reactions within organisms would be impossible under the conditions in cells. For example, the body temperature of most organisms is too low for reactions to occur quickly enough to carry out life processes. Reactants may also be present in such low concentrations that it is unlikely they will meet and collide. Therefore, the rate of most biochemical reactions must be increased by a catalyst. A catalyst is a chemical that speeds up chemical reactions. In organisms, catalysts are called enzymes . Essentially, enzymes are biological catalysts.  What is an answer for this question: Would test B see reactions taking place slower or faster than test A? Answer:","output":"Based on the given background information and the two tests conducted by Mark, test B is likely to observe reactions taking place faster than in test A. In test A, Mark reduces the catalysts (enzymes) within the organism. This means that there are fewer biological catalysts available to speed up the chemical reactions. As a result, the reactions will likely occur at a slower rate since there is less assistance for the reactants to meet and collide effectively, making it harder for life processes to occur quickly enough. In test B, Mark induces more catalysts (enzymes) in the organism. This increase in enzymes means that there are more biological catalysts available to facilitate the chemical reactions. Consequently, this should enhance the rate of reactions, as the catalysts help in increasing the chances of reactants meeting and colliding, speeding up the life processes. Therefore, test B should see chemical reactions taking place at a faster rate compared to test A, as the presence of more enzymes (biological catalysts) accelerates the reactions within the organism."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 2: Research on Ovid's Metamorphoses to find the character used as the new name for the disease. Step 3: Confirm the information to ensure its accuracy. Step 1: Identifying the time period The disease in question was prevalent in the late 15th century, during the Renaissance period, when it spread across Europe. Step 2: Research on Ovid's Metamorphoses Ovid's Metamorphoses is a long narrative poem that features a collection of myths. I will look for a character whose name became associated with the disease. Step 3: Confirming the information After my research, I found out that the character from Ovid's Metamorphoses used as the new name for the disease is Syphilus. The deadly disease was then named Syphilis, which is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. In conclusion, the disease that was previously named 'French disease' in Italy and Germany and 'Italian disease' in France is Syphilis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Yes, absolutely. And if you are experiencing that right now, I’m so sorry for you, but it gets better. Hear me out. I was once dating this girl from college who showed genuine interest in me and for that and many other reasons, I really liked her. Well, you could say I loved her. We had been together for a week. One day, we went on a trip. It was all fun and games and laughing. I had the best time of my life. We were walking on the beach of a lake during sunset. We were talking and suddenly, I felt her tone getting more and more depressed. At some point, she concluded that “we need to take a break.” Trying to understand her arguments for that, the break turned into a breakup. Now, one-week-into-a-relationship-with-awesome-girl me couldn’t handle this sudden change of affairs. I spent weeks reliving this day, especially the conversation on the beach, and trying to figure out where it went wrong. I even got into an episode of mania. Having to see her every day in college was torture. It was probably the worst breakup in my life. I seriously considered transferring to another university. Several weeks into the breakup, I decided, with the aid of my friends, that I have to move on. To be honest, I relapsed a lot. One time, I actually sat down with her and said I still have feelings for her. What really helped me to get out of this was the thing I hated the most at that time: taking a break. I avoided her, in real life and on social media, and eventually, I forgot that she even existed. I developed new hobbies and made new friends. Now, I healed properly and we’re back to being friends (Yes, it’s possible to stay friends with your ex). It was a bad experience to live through indeed, but it really changed me into a more stable, more productive person. In a way, I’m thankful to this girl for who I am today. Stay strong!

Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2]  The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3]  Helen got lots of different fruit as a gift from a friend that owned an orchard.

Write highlights for this article: A landscape restoration of a rubbish dump has won the Energy, Waste and Recycling category at the 2008 World Architecture Festival in Barcelona, Spain. Spanish architects Batlle and Roig have returned a 150 hectare rubbish dump back to nature. \\"La Vall d'en Joan\\" (The Valley of Joan) project, designed by Spanish architects Batlle and Roig, has transformed a 150 hectare site in the Garraf Natural Park, south-west of Barcelona into a green terraced agricultural landscape. In awarding the prize, judges Luis Mansilla -- Mansilla + Tunon architects -- and Martin Keiding -- editor-in-chief of Arkitektur DK -- described the scheme as: \\"a perfect example of bringing dead nature back to life by converting rubbish into a beautiful piece of landscape architecture...using few and humble means\\". Joan Roig of Batlle and Roig Architects told CNN: \\"The idea was to create a system of hills and banks in a way that would avoid erosion from water and to give the rubbish dump back to nature with a natural design.\\" Work to transform the site -- the largest landfill in Spain -- began in 2000 and was completed earlier this year. It is a striking redrawing of a previously scarred and polluted landscape. The landfill has been servicing Barcelona's metropolitan area for over 30 years. More than 20 million tons of rubbish was spread around the valley before the site was closed in 2006. In some places, you would have to dig down over 100 meters before you found soil again. But this isn't just a cosmetic makeover. There is an underground drainage system on site which filters contaminated waste fluids. Part of this recycled water is then used to irrigate the park. \\"The whole project is very sustainable,\\" Roig said. Furthermore, the dump is also utilizing the bio gas that is emitted to provide electricity. Some of the rubbish has remained above ground. Housed in large steel cages which flank the entrance to the site, Roig says they serve as a permanent reminder to visitors of the site's previous life. Judge, Martin Keiding told CNN: \\"It's a very beautiful and simple design. It is landscape architecture that is inspiring. It is a very good example that everyone could look at and say: 'We could do the same.' This competition is about pointing out good examples that could inspire architects.\\" Batlle and Roig's winning design was one of eight short-listed projects in the Energy, Waste and Recycling category, which was notable for the variety of entries. They range from state of the art, hi-tech plans such as the Digital Beijing designed by Studio Pei Zhu and Urbanus, right down to low-cost, primitive ventures like the Community Cooker devised by Kenyan company, Planning Systems Services. The communal cooker is turning rubbish into fuel to feed residents of one of Africa's biggest slums -- Kibera -- on the outskirts of Nairobi, Kenya. The project was highly commended by the judges. \\"Sustainability is a very important issue and so are the questions about rubbish, especially in Third World countries,\\" Keiding said. \\"The community cooker is a way of introducing a solution directly into the society.\\" Keiding, himself a trained architect, believes that Energy, Waste and Recycling is the most important category at the inaugural World Architecture Festival. \\"We are facing big problems, so it is a great opportunity for architects to work seriously with this problem on many different levels. \\"I think flashy executive buildings are interesting in one sense but they are not interesting if they are not dealing seriously with this matter. In my opinion you can throw them out. We have to be far more serious about integrating aspects of sustainability into architecture.\\" Both Mansilla and Keiding noted that engineering and architecture had to combine to deal with issues concerning waste and recycling. They said that achieving sustainability was a difficult task but it also represented a great opportunity for architects to contribute to the sphere.","output":"Spanish architects Batlle and Roig have won the Energy, Waste and Recycling category at the 2008 World Architecture Festival for their landscape restoration of a 150-hectare rubbish dump.

We tried fixing them but, it didn't hold and the boots had to be trashed. This was very upsetting due to the cost and the disappointment to my boys. I am looking for other boots to purchase that will hold up to the everyday wear and tear of boys. A:","output":"The given review would likely decrease the chances of buying the product. The review points out that the boots did not hold up well to everyday wear and tear, as they ripped apart at the toes and the sides of the front. Furthermore, the reviewer mentions that the attempts to fix the boots were unsuccessful, which eventually resulted in the boots being discarded. This information implies that the product may have quality and durability issues, and considering the disappointment and additional cost to the reviewer, potential buyers might be discouraged from purchasing the product based on this review."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Solve this instance: Passage: During the 2015-16 NBA season, James was criticized for his role in several off-court controversies, including the midseason firing of Cavaliers coach David Blatt. Despite these distractions, Cleveland finished the year with 57 wins and the best record in the East. Jamess final averages were 25.3 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on 52 percent shooting. In the 2016 NBA Playoffs, the Cavaliers advanced comfortably to the 2016 NBA Finals, losing only two games en route to a rematch with the 2015-16 Golden State Warriors season, who were coming off a record-setting 73-win season. To begin the series, Cleveland fell behind 3-1, including two blowout losses. James responded by registering back-to-back 41 point games in Games 5 and 6, leading the Cavaliers to two consecutive wins to stave off elimination. In Game 7, he posted a triple-double and made a number of key plays, including The Block (basketball) on Andre Iguodala, as Cleveland emerged victorious, winning the Cleveland sports curse and becoming the first team in NBA history to come back from a 3-1 series deficit in the Finals. James became just the third player to record a triple-double in an NBA Finals Game 7, and behind series averages of 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.3 blocks, and 2.6 steals per game, he also became the first player in league history to lead both teams in all five statistical categories for a playoff round, culminating in a unanimous Finals MVP selection. Student:","output":"1. How many more games did the Golden State Warriors win during the 2015-16 season compared to the Cleveland Cavaliers?    Answer: 73 - 57 = 16 games 2.

However, there will still be opportunities for interactions between Trump and his Latin and North American counterparts at the two-day summit that begins April 13 in Lima, Peru. The gathering takes place as Trump finalizes plans to send the military to the U.S. border with Mexico and threatens to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. In addition, Trump's recently imposed steel and aluminum tariffs have sparked criticism from many of the attendees at the summit, though some countries have received temporary exemptions. Despite all the turbulence, White House officials outlined a fairly traditional agenda for the summit. \\"A win for this president at this summit will be a strong speech focused on regional governance, leadership on Venezuela and promoting reciprocal trade,\\" a senior administration official said. The official would not say whether Trump will continue to \\"speak his mind\\" during the summit on sensitive issues such as immigration. Trump has repeatedly portrayed immigration from South and Central America as both a national security and economic threat. During his presidential campaign, Trump accused Mexico of sending rapists, drug dealers and criminals across the border. Trump has also clashed with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto over the funding of a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico. The president has long insisted that Mexico will pay for the wall. The disagreement become so heated earlier this year that Pena Nieto canceled plans to visit the White House. It is not clear whether Trump will hold a one-on-one meeting with Pena Nieto during the summit, U.S. officials said.  But Trump will not meet with Cuban leader Raul Castro or anyone from the Venezuelan delegation, White House officials said. \\"Obviously the Cubans will be participating in the summit, so there will be a mixing of regional...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Bashing Cliven Bundy for his remarks regarding race is like LeBron James dunking on a 5-foot rim: Pointless. And the same is true for Los Angeles Clippers owner Don Sterling, if you believe that he made the remarks attributed to him by TMZ and Deadspin. As President Barack Obama said, \\"when ignorant folks want to advertise their ignorance, you don't really have to do anything, you just let them talk.\\" Still talking about the talk of the ignorant is fun. After all, few things are more entertaining than well-executed memes and a hashtag in front of stupidity. The problem is that while men such as Bundy and Sterling may be racist, they are not the face of racism. Not today's version. But we'll place that yoke on their shoulders anyway because it's easy, like James dunking on a kiddie rim. Some conservatives will quickly pedal away from the Bundys and the Ted Nugents of the world, insisting that they are not like those rodeo clowns. They don't have a racist bone in their body because they would never make such outlandish statements. But then they turn around and marvel at how \\"well-spoken\\" or \\"articulate\\" a black person is and think nothing of it. Politicians of all stripes will publicly denounce the offensive things that Bundy says but continue to construct policies that cater to his sensibilities. Today, racism isn't a crazy old white man with a dead calf on his shoulders proclaiming he's \\"unracist.\\" No, it's elected officials such as U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin saying inner-city men are \\"not even thinking about working or learning the value and the culture of work\\" and then feigning shock that people saw a racist element to his statements. Bundy and Sterling are just the lightning rods of the moment. Not too long ago, Paula Deen was the social pariah. Meanwhile, Racism 2.0 is busily working in the shadows, gerrymandering away voting rights and creating legislation that makes pre-emptively shooting dead a young black man who makes you nervous synonymous with standing one's ground. The longer the media allow ignorant relics like Bundy to continue to hog the spotlight -- and the public points at him as the face of conservative racism -- the longer the current incarnation can go unchecked. That doesn't mean Bundy's fight with the government should be ignored. That doesn't mean Sterling's alleged remarks -- and well-documented past of discrimination -- should be overlooked. Only that their views -- and thus, importance -- should be kept in perspective. For mispronouncing Rosa Parks' name pales in comparison to the politics of courting a racist electorate. It pales in comparison to the lack of compassion for the five children who were shot Easter Sunday at a park on the south side of Chicago or the characterization of poor people as takers. During the height of the recession, according to an analysis in The American Prospect, 33 states increased spending on prisons while decreasing spending on education, and we're to believe the disproportionate number of minorities in jail is a coincidence? So, yeah, yuk it up at Bundy's expense. Keep tweeting #boycottClippers if it makes you feel better (though I'd be more prone to use my 140 characters to ask why the NAACP thought Sterling was a good candidate for a lifetime achievement award). But don't make such people out to be anything more than what they are -- the few remaining voices of oppression from years past. Today racism has a different look. A different sound. A different voice -- though the song is still the same. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"The article suggests that while it may be easy to criticize and ridicule people like Cliven Bundy and Don Sterling for their racist remarks, they are not the true face of modern-day racism. Racism today is more subtle and lies in the actions of politicians and institutions that create policies catering to racist sensibilities or perpetuate inequality. Examples given include gerrymandering, voter suppression, and disproportionate spending on prisons over education.

Help as much as you can. Information:  - The coconut tree (\\"Cocos nucifera\\") is a member of the family Arecaceae (palm family) and the only species of the genus \\"Cocos\\". The term coconut can refer to the whole coconut palm or the seed, or the fruit, which, botanically, is a drupe, not a nut. The spelling cocoanut is an archaic form of the word. The term is derived from the 16th-century Portuguese and Spanish word \\"coco\\" meaning \\"head\\" or \\"skull\\", from the three indentations on the coconut shell that resemble facial features.  - A mammary gland is an exocrine gland in mammals that produces milk to feed young offspring. Mammals get their name from the word \\"mammary\\". The mammary glands are arranged in organs such as the breasts in primates (for example, humans and chimpanzees), the udder in ruminants (for example, cows, goats, and deer), and the dugs of other animals (for example, dogs and cats). Lactorrhea, the occasional production of milk by the glands, can occur in any mammal, but in most mammals lactation, the production of enough milk for nursing, occurs only in phenotypic females who have gestated in recent months or years. It is directed by hormonal guidance from sex steroids. In a few mammalian species, male lactation can occur.  - Coconut milk is the liquid that comes from the grated meat of a brown coconut . It should not be confused with coconut water . The color and rich taste of coconut milk can be attributed to the high oil content . Most of the fat is saturated fat . Coconut milk is a very popular food ingredient used in Southeast Asia , South Asia , Southern China , the Caribbean and north of South America .  - Coconut water is the clear liquid inside young green coconuts (fruits of the coconut palm). In early development, it serves as a suspension for the endosperm of the coconut during the nuclear phase of development. As growth continues, the endosperm matures into its cellular phase and deposits into the rind of the coconut meat.  - Milk is a pale liquid produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for infant mammals (including humans who breastfeed) before they are able to digest other types of food. Early-lactation milk contains colostrum, which carries the mother's antibodies to its young and can reduce the risk of many diseases. It contains many other nutrients including protein and lactose.    What entity does 'coconut milk' has the relation 'natural product of taxon' with? The answer to this question is:","output":"Coconut milk has the relation 'natural product of taxon' with the coconut tree (Cocos nucifera), which is a member of the family Arecaceae (palm family) and the only species of the genus \\"Cocos\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It's haunting and beautiful but you're aware that this music is similar to Newman's other work and while listening to the soundtrack you're reminded of SCENT OF A WOMAN , MEETING JOE BLACK and THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION you're reminded of other films as the story unfolds on screen . As the Sullivans drive round America trying to escape from a psychotic hit man you think of THE GETAWAY , Irish gangsters is MILLER'S CROSSING whilst the subtext of guilt and redemption can be summed up by Coppola and Leone's gangster epics. Despite having a seen it all before feel this shouldn't be taken as a heavy criticism of Sam Mendes film which I repeat is haunting and beautiful and the only flaws that work against it is a very slow opening twenty minutes and I was slightly confused as the events that caused Michael Sullivan to be betrayed . But if you stop to consider how much of a sentimental mess Spielberg might have made with the story that revolves around a father and his twelve year old son running for their lives you can't help thinking what a superb director Mendes is  ROAD TO PERDITION is a film where the entire cast give flawless performances . I've never been all that keen on Tom Hanks but he's every bit as good here as he has been in any starring role , probably better . Paul Newman plays a character with an Irish accent but at no point did I believe I was watching an American screen legend putting on a false accent - Newman's performance works due to the subtle body language , his character is torn up by guilt but Newman never milks it or goes over the top . While never upstaging Newman who gives the best performance in the movie the two Brit supporting actors Craig and Law are also very memorable as American gangsters and while Law will still have a long career as a leading actor one wonders how Daniel Craig might have progressed as a character actor if he hadn't decided to become James Bond , a role which heralds the end of an actors career Would you say this review is positive or negative?","output":"This review is mostly positive.

Situation: More snakes are hungrier because of chickens leaving. Now, let's discuss the steps and the potential impacts of the situation. Step 1 and 2: As the birds lay eggs and they hatch into baby birds, the number of birds will initially increase. Step 3: Baby birds need to eat to grow. At this step, the situation comes into play. If there are more hungry snakes due to the departure of chickens, it is likely that these snakes will start preying on the baby birds to satiate their hunger. This can potentially decrease the number of baby birds that survive to adulthood. Step 4: If fewer baby birds grow into adult birds due to predation by the hungrier snakes, there will be a smaller population of adult birds. Step 5 and 6: With a smaller adult bird population, there may be fewer opportunities for mating and nest-building, which could lead to fewer bird pairs laying eggs in the future. Step 7: Fewer bird pairs laying eggs will affect the overall population of birds. Based on this analysis, the correct answer is: B: less"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Hackers steal 83 million Chase customers’ info In a massive cyber-attack on JPMorgan Chase, hackers stole the personal information of a staggering 83 million customers, the banking giant revealed Thursday. It took the bank more than two months to detect the largest known data breach in history, which began in June and affected 76 million households and 7 million small-business owners, sources told The Post. The hackers were able to get access to customer data through “external sites” such as chase.com, said one person familiar with the investigation. JPMorgan insisted that while the cyber-thieves accessed addresses, ­e-mail info and phone numbers, other sensitive information — such as account numbers, passwords, user IDs, dates of birth and Social Security numbers — were not affected. Experts, though, were dubious about that claim. “The cynic in me says if [that additional data] were on the same system, they probably had access to it and they’ve probably taken it,” said Rob Sloan, head of ­cyber-content and data for Dow Jones Risk and Compliance. The bank said there had not been any unusual customer-fraud reports related to the huge data breach, adding that customers would not be held liable for any unauthorized transactions on their accounts. The attack also targeted “internal JPMorgan Chase information” such as customer profiles. That internal information describes if clients have a mortgage or auto loan, as well as indicating their net worth, said JPMorgan spokeswoman Patricia Wexler. Bloomberg News reported that hackers in Russia were behind the breach, but sources told The Post that the identity of the cyber-thieves remains unclear. The bank — the nation’s largest when ranked by assets — has been cooperating with law enforcement. CEO Jamie Dimon said in a prophetic message in his April 9 annual shareholder letter that despite spending millions on cyber-security, JPMorgan remained worried about the threat of attacks. By the end of this year, the bank estimated that it will be spending about 250 million annually on ­cyber-security and employing 1,000 people in that area. In August, the FBI said it was working with the Secret Service to determine the scope of recent cyber-attacks against several American financial institutions and retailers. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"Hackers conducted a massive cyber-attack on JPMorgan Chase, stealing personal information of 83 million customers, making it the largest known data breach in history.

To provide a more detailed analysis, we can break the tweet down into elements and understand the thought process behind this categorization: 1. \\"heard 'le eme' put outta greenlight on HP\\": This part of the tweet suggests that there's been some news or a rumor about an action ordered by \\"le eme\\", which is likely a reference to the Mexican Mafia. The term \\"greenlight\\", in this context, is slang for an authorization to carry out a violent act, likely against a rival gang or member. From the onset, the tweet is discussing events related to gang violence and criminal activities, which inherently hold negative connotations. 2. \\"due to a member killing a pregnant Avenues chica\\": This portion of the tweet adds further negativity to the sentiment since it discusses a tragic and grim event, which is the death of a pregnant woman (\\"chica\\" is a Spanish slang term for a young woman) believed to be affiliated with the Avenues gang. The fact that an innocent unborn child was also affected by the violence creates a stronger negative impression. 3. \\"thats fucked up anyway u look at it\\": The tweet concludes with the author's opinion on this matter, using informal language and a strong curse word to express their strong disapproval and condemnable sentiment towards the events mentioned.

Question: Information:  - In Greek mythology, Eurotas was a king of Laconia, the son of King Myles and grandson of Lelex, eponymous ancestor of the Leleges. He had no male heir, but he did have a daughter Sparta and wife Clete. Eurotas bequeathed the kingdom to Lacedaemon, the son of Taygete, after whom Mount Taygetus is named, and Zeus, according to Pausanias. Lacedaemon married Sparta and renamed the state after his wife.  - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states.   - Sparta (Doric Greek: ; Attic Greek: ) was a prominent city-state in ancient Greece. In antiquity the city-state was known as Lacedaemon, while the name Sparta referred to its main settlement on the banks of the Eurotas River in Laconia, in south-eastern Peloponnese. Around 650 BC, it rose to become the dominant military land-power in ancient Greece.  - A city-state is a sovereign state that consists of a city and its dependent territories. Historically, this included cities such as Rome, Athens, Carthage, and the Italian city-states during the Renaissancebut today only a handful of sovereign city-states exist, with some disagreement as to which are city-states. A great deal of consensus exists that the term properly applies to Singapore, Monaco, and Vatican City.  - Eurycrates ( Greek :  Eurykrates ) was a king of the Greek city - state of Sparta , one of the Agiad ( also spelled Agiade ) kings , who was preceded by his father Polydorus and followed by his son Anaxander . He ruled from 665 to 640 BC.  - Vatican City , officially Vatican City State or the State of Vatican City, is a walled enclave within the city of Rome. With an area of approximately 44 hectares (110 acres), and a population of 842, it is the smallest State in the world by both area and population, but formally it is not sovereign, sovereignty being held by the Holy See, the only entity of public international law that has diplomatic relations with almost every country in the world.  - Anaxander or Anaxandros was the 12th Agiad dynasty King of Sparta (ruled c. 640-615 BC).  - Singapore, officially the Republic of Singapore, and often referred to as the \\"Lion City\\" or the \\"Little Red Dot\\", is a sovereign city-state in Southeast Asia, and the world's only island city-state. It lies one degree (137 km) north of the equator, south of the southernmost tip of continental Asia and peninsular Malaysia, with Indonesia's Riau Islands to the south. Singapore's territory consists of a diamond-shaped main island along with 62 other islets. Since independence, extensive land reclamation has increased its total size by 23% (130 km), and its greening policy has covered the densely populated island with tropical flora, parks and gardens.  - Monaco, officially the Principality of Monaco, is a sovereign city-state and microstate, located on the French Riviera in Western Europe. France borders the country on three sides while the other side borders the Mediterranean Sea. Monaco has an area of and a population of about 37,800; it is the second smallest and the most densely populated country in the world. Monaco has a land border of , a coastline of , and a width that varies between . The highest point in the country is a narrow pathway named Chemin des Révoires on the slopes of Mont Agel, in the Les Révoires \\"Ward\\", which is above sea level. Monaco's most populous \\"Quartier\\" is Monte Carlo and the most populous \\"Ward\\" is Larvotto/Bas Moulins. Through land reclamation, Monaco's land mass has expanded by twenty percent. Monaco is known as a playground for the rich and famous, due to its tax laws. In 2014, it was noted about 30% of the population was made up of millionaires, more than in Zürich or Geneva.  - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: Why might some graduates choose not to be attending school later in life? Possible A: detention, stupidity, overwhelmed, dropping out, much work  Why is \\"much work\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"The answer \\"much work\\" is considered aligned with human common sense for a number of reasons. As people progress through life, their responsibilities, commitments, and personal goals may evolve, resulting in them having to allocate their time and energy differently. Let's delve deeper into how these factors might contribute to a graduate choosing to not pursue further education later in life: 1. Time constraints: As graduates enter the workforce, they might find themselves dedicating an increasing amount of time to their career. They may have a demanding job or be working towards career advancements and promotions that require their undivided attention. In such cases, taking on additional academic pursuits may not be feasible. 2. Financial commitments: Graduates may have economic responsibilities, such as mortgages, student loans, and providing for their family, which could limit their capacity to finance further education. Investing in additional schooling may not be a priority when considering their financial obligations. 3. Work-life balance: Maintaining a healthy work-life balance is essential for mental and emotional well-being. Graduates who are already juggling work, personal relationships, and other aspects of everyday life may decide not to pursue higher education to maintain a balanced lifestyle. 4. Achieving career goals: Some graduates may have already achieved their desired career goals and do not see a need to pursue further education. If they believe their current level of education is sufficient for their chosen field, they might feel it's unnecessary to continue down the academic path. 5. Limited career benefits: People may evaluate the pros and cons of continuing their education at later stages in life. They might realize that not all academic qualifications lead to significant career advancements or additional income, thus deciding to invest their time and energy in other areas. 6. Shift in priorities: As people age, their priorities in life often change. This may include focusing on personal relationships, family life, travel, and other experiences. Investing time in education might not align with their current goals or desires. Taking all these factors into consideration, it's evident that \\"much work\\" as a response aligns with human common sense due to the various practical, financial, and personal reasons that might influence a graduate's decision not to attend school later in life. Their circumstances, responsibilities, and changing priorities create a complex situation in which further education may not be the preferred direction for them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  In the interim came The Beatles, a double LP commonly known as the White Album for its virtually featureless cover. Creative inspiration for the album came from a new direction: without Epstein's guiding presence, the group had briefly turned to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi as their guru. At his ashram in Rishikesh, India, a \\"Guide Course\\" scheduled for three months marked one of their most prolific periods, yielding numerous songs including a majority of the 30 included on the album. However, Starr left after only ten days, likening it to Butlins, and McCartney eventually grew bored and departed a month later. For Lennon and Harrison, creativity turned to questioning when an electronics technician known as Magic Alex suggested that the Maharishi was attempting to manipulate them. When he alleged that the Maharishi had made sexual advances to women attendees, a persuaded Lennon left abruptly just two months into the course, bringing an unconvinced Harrison and the remainder of the group's entourage with him. In anger, Lennon wrote a scathing song titled \\"Maharishi\\", renamed \\"Sexy Sadie\\" to avoid potential legal issues. McCartney said, \\"We made a mistake. We thought there was more to him than there was.\\"During recording sessions for the White Album, which stretched from late May to mid-October 1968, relations between the Beatles grew openly divisive. Starr quit for two weeks, and McCartney took over the drum kit for \\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\\" (on which Harrison and Lennon drummed as well) and \\"Dear Prudence\\". Lennon had lost interest in collaborating with McCartney, whose contribution \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\\" he scorned as \\"granny music shit\\". Tensions were further aggravated by Lennon's romantic preoccupation with avant-garde artist Yoko Ono, whom he insisted on bringing to the sessions despite the group's well-established understanding that girlfriends were not allowed in the studio.

Q:The answer to the question: What is the name of the church that is of red brick and Pevsner considered it \\"astonishingly restrained.\\" is inside the article: In 1859 Burges began work with Ambrose Poynter on the Maison Dieu, Dover, which was completed in 1861. Emulation of the original medieval style can be seen in his renovation of the grotesque animals and in the coats of arms incorporated into his new designs. Burges later designed the Council Chamber, added in 1867, and in 1881 began work on Connaught Hall in Dover, a town meeting and concert hall. The new building contained meeting rooms and mayoral and official offices. Although Burges designed the project, most of it was completed after his death by his partners, Pullan and Chapple. The listed status of the Maison Dieu was reclassified as Grade I in 2017 and Dover District Council, the building's owner, is seeking grant funding to enable a restoration, focussing on Burges's work.In 1859–60, Burges took over the restoration of Waltham Abbey from Poynter, working with Poynter's son Edward Poynter and with furniture makers Harland and Fisher. He commissioned Edward Burne-Jones of James Powell & Sons to make three stained-glass windows for the east end, representing the Tree of Jesse. The Abbey is a demonstration of Burges's skills as a restorer, with \\"a profound sensitivity towards medieval architecture.\\" Mordaunt Crook wrote of Burges's interior that, \\"it meets the Middle Ages as an equal.\\" In 1861–2, Burges was commissioned by Charles Edward Lefroy, secretary to the Speaker of the House of Commons, to build All Saints Church, Fleet, as a memorial to Lefroy's wife.

No Gold is not the correct answer to the question \\"_ is found in most molecules.\\" if we consider nitrogen to be found in most molecules. The element gold (Au) is a heavy metal and does not form an integral part of most molecules. Its occurrence in molecular structures is quite rare as compared to nitrogen. Nitrogen is an essential element found in a wide range of molecules, such as amino acids (the building blocks of proteins), nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), and it is a major component in the Earth's atmosphere (comprising approximately 78%). Nitrogen plays several roles in biological, chemical, and physical processes. It is a critical element for life on Earth. Gold, on the other hand, has fewer roles in biochemistry and is generally not found in most molecules. There are a few examples of gold-containing compounds used for specific applications, such as anti-cancer drugs, but these cases are quite rare. Due to its cost, chemical properties, and lack of usage in the structure and function of biological molecules, gold is not a common element found in most molecular formations.

Bozz has no desire to go to war and acts like it. Even though his weekend leave is withdrawn he still goes to town and ends up going to a hotel room with two girls and fellow soldier Paxton (Matthew Davis). Bozz and Paxton make friends despite their different outlooks; Paxton has enlisted for service and wants to go to Nam for the experience.At the base, while Bozz shows that he is capable of being a good soldier when he wants to, he continues to attract disciplinary penalties as well as the anger of fellow privates, especially one named Wilson (Shea Whigham). The higher ranked personnel are abusive, especially Sergeant Thomas (James MacDonald), who one night knocks young Private Cantwell (Tom Guiry) to pieces. When Bozz learns that Cantwell is married and a father to four children he helps Cantwell get out of military duty. Soon after, Private Miter (Clifton Collins Jr.), made platoon leader, is left a nervous wreck when officers abuse him for not managing to control his group. Though Bozz continues to disobey orders, Sergeant Landers (Afemo Omilami) is determined to turn him into a soldier and makes him new platoon leader. When Miter breaks down and wants to leave base, Bozz helps him get out of the army for mental health reasons.

Question: Information:  - An astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who concentrates their studies on a specific question or field outside of the scope of Earth. They look at stars, planets, moons, comets and galaxies, as well as many other celestial objects  either in observational astronomy, in analyzing the data or in theoretical astronomy. Examples of topics or fields astronomers work on include: planetary science, solar astronomy, the origin or evolution of stars, or the formation of galaxies. There are also related but distinct subjects like physical cosmology which studies the Universe as a whole.  - Robert Andrews Millikan (March 22, 1868  December 19, 1953) was an American experimental physicist honored with the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1923 for the measurement of the elementary electronic charge and for his work on the photoelectric effect.  - The Universe is all of time and space and its contents. It includes planets, moons, minor planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space, and all matter and energy. The size of the entire Universe is unknown.  - George Ellery Hale (June 29, 1868  February 21, 1938) was an American solar astronomer, best known for his discovery of magnetic fields in sunspots, and as the leader or key figure in the planning or construction of several world-leading telescopes; namely, the 40-inch refracting telescope at Yerkes Observatory, 60-inch Hale reflecting telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory, 100-inch Hooker reflecting telescope at Mount Wilson, and the 200-inch Hale reflecting telescope at Palomar Observatory.  - The Association of American Universities (AAU) is an international organization of leading research universities devoted to maintaining a strong system of academic research and education. It consists of 60 universities in the United States (both public and private) and two universities in Canada.  - Amos Gager Throop (; 18111894) was a businessman and politician in Chicago, Illinois during the 1840s and 1850s. Most famously he was known for being a staunch abolitionist prior to the Civil War. In Chicago he lost two campaigns to be that city's mayor in 1852 and 1854. In both elections he was the nominee of the little-known Temperance Party, facing tough opposition from the Democratic Party. At the time of the Great Chicago Fire Amos was the city treasurer. He was instrumental in securing financing from New York to rebuild the wooden frontier town into a city of brick and mortar. Grateful Chicagoans renamed Main Street to Throop Street. Many years later and after moving to California, he was finally elected mayorof Pasadena, California in 1888.  - Wallace Leslie William Sargent FRS ( February 15 , 1935 -- October 29 , 2012 ) was a British - born American astronomer and the Ira S. Bowen Professor of Astronomy at California Institute of Technology .  - Physical cosmology is the study of the largest-scale structures and dynamics of the Universe and is concerned with fundamental questions about its origin, structure, evolution, and ultimate fate. Cosmology as a science originated with the Copernican principle, which implies that celestial bodies obey identical physical laws to those on Earth, and Newtonian mechanics, which first allowed us to understand those physical laws. Physical cosmology, as it is now understood, began with the development in 1915 of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, followed by major observational discoveries in the 1920s: first, Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe contains a huge number of external galaxies beyond our own Milky Way; then, work by Vesto Slipher and others showed that the universe is expanding. These advances made it possible to speculate about the origin of the universe, and allowed the establishment of the Big Bang Theory, by Georges Lemaitre, as the leading cosmological model. A few researchers still advocate a handful of alternative cosmologies; however, most cosmologists agree that the Big Bang theory explains the observations better.  - A comet is an icy small Solar System body that, when passing close to the Sun, warms and begins to evolve gasses, a process called outgassing. This produces a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due to the effects of solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times the Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch one astronomical unit. If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen from the Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures.  - A vocational school, sometimes called a trade school or vocational college, is a post-secondary educational institution designed to provide vocational education, or technical skills required to perform the tasks of a particular and specific job. Vocational schools are traditionally distinguished from four-year colleges by their focus on job-specific training to students who are typically bound for one of the skilled trades, rather than providing academic training for students pursuing careers in a professional discipline. While many schools have largely adhered to this convention, the purely vocational focus of other trade schools began to shift in the 1990s \\"toward a broader preparation that develops the academic\\" as well as technical skills of their students.  Australia. Vocational schools were called \\"technical colleges\\" in Australia, and there were more than 20 schools specializing in vocational educational training (VET). Only four technical colleges remain, and these are now referred to as \\"trade colleges\\". At these colleges, students complete a modified year 12 certificate and commence a school-based apprenticeship in a trade of their choice. There are two trade colleges in Queensland; Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Australian Industry Trade College and one in Adelaide, Vergalargona rico, Technical College, and another in Perth, Australian Trades College.  - The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is a federally funded research and development center and NASA field center located in La Cañada Flintridge, California and Pasadena, California, United States.  - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes.  - Pasadena is a city in Los Angeles County, California, United States. As of 2013, the estimated population of Pasadena was 139,731, making it the 183rd-largest city in the United States. Pasadena is the ninth-largest city in Los Angeles County. Pasadena was incorporated on June 19, 1886, becoming only the second city to be incorporated in what is now Los Angeles County, after Los Angeles (April 4, 1850). It is one of the primary cultural centers of the San Gabriel Valley.  - Arthur Amos Noyes (September 13, 1866  June 3, 1936) was a U.S. chemist, inventor and educator. He received a PhD. in 1890 at Leipzig under the guidance of Wilhelm Ostwald.  - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such.  - The California Institute of Technology (abbreviated Caltech) is a private doctorate-granting university located in Pasadena, California, United States. Although founded as a preparatory and vocational school by Amos G. Throop in 1891, the college attracted influential scientists such as George Ellery Hale, Arthur Amos Noyes, and Robert Andrews Millikan in the early 20th century. The vocational and preparatory schools were disbanded and spun off in 1910, and the college assumed its present name in 1921. In 1934, Caltech was elected to the Association of American Universities, and the antecedents of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which Caltech continues to manage and operate, were established between 1936 and 1943 under Theodore von Kármán. The university is one among a small group of Institutes of Technology in the United States which is primarily devoted to the instruction of technical arts and applied sciences.

I know that I’m sensitive to shampoos containing sodium laureth sulfate (also known as SLS, it’s the ingredient that makes shampoos, shower gels and soaps lather) but I’m also sensitive to some other ingredients in shampoos too – mainly fragrances. I had previously been using Rainforest Balance Shampoo and Conditioner from The Body Shop®, but I found the conditioner a bit too rich and my hair didn’t always feel totally clean after using it. So I started doing a bit of research into recommended natural shampoos – and this Sensitive Shampoo from Lavera kept coming up again and again! Several of the reviews I read said that this was the best shampoo for sensitive scalps and that it left hair feeling really clean and soft, so I decided to try it. The shampoo is a translucent peach-coloured gel that contains organic witch hazel and organic almond milk. It has quite a strong scent, but it’s a nice one so it doesn’t put me off. The shampoo feels creamy when you rub it together in your hands, but I did need quite a lot of it to get a good lather on my first application – the second application lathers a lot more easily. I definitely agree that this makes hair feel a lot cleaner than a lot of the other SLS-free shampoos that I’ve tried, my hair feels clean and full and soft when I’ve used it – the same way it would do if I were using a regular shampoo. I think it also helps my hair to dry more quickly and makes it easier to straighten too. But where this shampoo is outstanding is the way it makes my scalp feel – my scalp feels soothed and calm and there’s no hint of itching. I’ve been using Lavera Sensitive Shampoo for over a year now and I wouldn’t change it for the world, it’s definitely one of the best shampoos for a sensitive itchy scalp.

The couple's son Radley Horwitz told the court in Palm Beach, Florida that he awoke at the house when he heard nine shots ring out and his mother screaming. Scroll down for video. Accused: Donna Horwitz, 66, in court this week in Palm Beach, Florida after she allegedly shot dead her estranged husband at their lavish home in 2011. Witness: Radley Horwitz gave evidence against his mother at her murder trial over the fatal shooting of his father Lanny. Mr Horwitz Jr, 38, found his father dying on the bathroom floor in a pool of blood and his mother near to the victim's naked body. An autopsy later revealed Mr Horwitz senior had multiple gunshot wounds to the torso and arms along with one shot fired directly in his mouth. Radley told the court on Monday: 'She [Donna] was screaming my name and she might have said ''your father, your father'' or something like that.' He added: 'He made this godawful, inhuman gurgling sound.' The Horwitzs, who had married twice and recently separated again, were reportedly having a furious row on the morning of September 30, 2011 at their home in the exclusive Admiral's Cove district of  Jupiter. Lanny, a 66-year-old real estate attorney, had reportedly been packing for a weekend with a woman who was believed to be a girlfriend when he was killed. Slain: The body of Lanny Horwitz was found with nine gunshot wounds in the bathroom at his home in Admiral's Cove, Florida. According to WPBF, Radley said his father was 'sarcastic and belittling' and that his mother was deeply affected by how her treated her. It was also revealed at the trial, which began last Friday, that Radley harbored ill feelings towards his father and once owned a book on how to hire a hitman. Radley Horwitz and his father Lanny's financial affairs were in ruins at the time of the murder, the court heard and Radley stood to benefit from a 500,000 life insurance policy his father had taken out. He has denied killing his father. The defense have alleged that the 66-year-old businessman was shot either by his son or an unknown intruder. Bitter battle: Donna Horwitz had married her husband Lanny twice and the couple were separating for the second time when he was shot dead at his Florida home. Mrs Horwitz's attorney Grey Tesh said at the opening of the trial that DNA from a speck of blood was found on a gate outside the home which did not match the accused. As the prosecution brought in final witnesses today, a police detective told the jury that Mrs Horwitz had hoped for a reconciliation with her husband and was in complete despair that he seemed to be leaving her for someone else. Detective Eric Frank read from Mrs Horwitz's journal, where she wrote: 'My heart is broken and he is working on my mind, playing games with me' according to the Palm Beach Post. The jury is expected to hear closing arguments tomorrow morning. Crime scene: The Horwitzs' luxury home in Admiral's Cove, Jupiter where 66-year-old Lanny was found murdered in September 2011.

Beyond the table, as if turned to stone by this culminating horror of revelation, stood Aline.  M. de La Tour d'Azyr was the first to stir. Into his bewildered mind came the memory of something that Mme. de Plougastel had said of a letter that was on the table. He came forward, unhindered. The announcement made, Mme. de Plougastel no longer feared the sequel, and so she let him go. He walked unsteadily past this new-found son of his, and took up the sheet that lay beside the candlebranch. A long moment he stood reading it, none heeding him. Aline's eyes were all on Andre-Louis, full of wonder and commiseration, whilst Andre-Louis was staring down, in stupefied fascination, at his mother.  M. de La Tour d'Azyr read the letter slowly through. Then very quietly he replaced it.

Then he stepped back to Mme. de Plougastel's side and stooped to raise her.  \\"Therese,\\" he said.  Obeying, by instinct, the implied command, she made an effort to rise and to control herself in her turn. The Marquis half conducted, half carried her to the armchair by the table.

Breaking out from the \\"Other Asian\\" grouping, these South Asian residents have planted roots throughout the city, together quadrupling in size over the past decade. \\"In Queens, there's a fast-growing South Asian community,\\" said Howard Shih, the Census programs director for the Asian American Federation advocacy group, which recently released a report. \\"Once there's a core immigrant group, you start drawing more people.\\" In 2000, the \\"Other Asian\\" category included fewer than 2,000 Queens residents but has since skyrocketed to more than 7,000 in the 2010 count - including 240 Bhutanese, 2,132 Burmese and 4,930 Nepalese. The actual numbers may also be much higher due to undercounting, experts said. These three groups are concentrated in Sunnyside, Maspeth, Elmhurst, Woodside and Jackson Heights, according to the Asian American Federation. \\"Because of the way the U.S. has grouped everyone together, the South Asian community has often been less visible,\\" said Seema Agnani, executive director of Chhaya Community Development Corp., a South Asian housing group in Queens. Recognition through new categories is significant, said Bishnu Pradhan, 40, a Woodside resident formerly on the board of the Association of Bhutanese in America. \\"It's important for us to have a separate category, rather than be lumped into one,\\" said Pradhan, an accountant. \\"The population of the Bhutanese will grow.\\" Like many Bhutanese immigrants who end up in Queens, Pradhan is a refugee who originally moved to Nepal from Bhutan, a small South Asian country in the Himalayas. Pradhan was one of the first from Bhutan in the borough in 1998, he said, adding that he has seen the population grow. \\"In Queens, because there are people from several South Asian countries, they feel like they are at home,\\" he said. \\"We have a lot of people from Nepal and India who are already established in the Queens area,\\" said Ravi Gurung, a Bhutanese resident of Woodside, who moved to Queens 12 years ago. \\"Every corner, we find someone we can talk with.\\" Pema Dorji, a 35-year-old Woodside resident from Bhutan, said it was an important step for him to come to Queens - and he's glad the Census Bureau is recognizing that. \\"My dream was to be here,\\" said Dorji, who works for a shipping company. \\"I'm very proud to be Bhutanese. We are a small country, but we are known in the world.\\" Summary:","output":"The United States Census Bureau has recognized the significant increase in Burmese, Bhutanese, and Nepalese immigrants by including them as separate categories instead of the previous \\"Other Asian\\" grouping.

Write a summary based on this article: Math Bee: Honeybees Seem To Understand The Notion Of Zero      Enlarge this image toggle caption Don Farrall/Getty Images Don Farrall/Getty Images      Honeybees understand that \\"nothing\\" can be \\"something\\" that has numerical meaning, showing that they have a primitive grasp of the concept of zero.      That's according to a newly published study in Science, which shows that bees possess a mathematical ability once thought to exist only in dolphins, primates, birds and humans who are beyond the preschool years.      \\"This is quite amazing, in my view, that bees can really do it,\\" says Andreas Nieder, a scientist who studies how animals' process the idea of \\"nothing\\" and was not part of the research team.      He says zero was discovered relatively recently in human history, and was essential in the development of both mathematics and science. \\"It's a hard and very abstract concept,\\" Nieder says. \\"It is a sort of eccentric uncle in the number family.\\"      Previous experiments have shown that honeybees have some facility with numbers, because they were able to count landmarks as they foraged around for a sweet reward. But in these tests, the insects couldn't count very high — only to about four.      Still, that made a team of researchers in Australia and France want to explore what else the bees could do with numbers. Scarlett Howard at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, lured bees to a wall where they were presented with two square cards. Each card had a different number of black symbols, such as dots or triangles.      Howard trained one group of bees to understand that sugar water would always be located under the card with the least number of symbols. \\"They could come and see two circles versus three circles, or four triangles versus one triangle, or something like that,\\" she explains.      The bees quickly learned to fly to the card with the fewest symbols, an impressive feat.      But then they got another test: The researchers presented the bees with a card that had a single symbol — and a blank card that had nothing on it.      The bees seemed to understand that \\"zero\\" was less than one, because they flew toward the blank card more often than you'd expect if they were choosing at random — although they weren't that good at distinguishing between the two.      It got easier for them when they had to compare zero with a larger number. \\"When we showed them zero versus six, they did that at a much higher level than zero versus one,\\" Howard says. \\"So what tells us is that they consider zero as an actual quantity along the number line. They're actually better at doing zero versus six because those two numbers are further apart.\\"      \\"We were very surprised and happy, excited, to see that actually the bees were choosing the empty paper,\\" says Aurore Avargues-Weber, a CNRS researcher with the University of Toulouse.      Even very young children, she points out, have trouble understanding that zero is a number. \\"It's easy for them to count 'one, two, three, four,' but zero, it's nothing, it's not something to count. So it's not the same category,\\" she explains.      She had expected that the bees would see a blank paper as something irrelevant that was completely different than what they had been trained on, because to understand zero, \\"brains need to represent something out of nothing. It's not trivial.\\"      What's more, the brains of bees are incredibly tiny brains compared with the brains of humans, Nieder notes. \\"Bees really have a mini-brain with fewer than one million brain cells,\\" he says, \\"compared to 86 billion nerve cells in our brain.\\"      Even so, the bees can understand the abstract concept of an empty set — the precursor or prerequisite to understanding the symbolic number zero — and he says he found that very surprising. ||||| Trained to pick the lowest number out of a series of options, a honeybee chooses a blank image, revealing an understanding of the concept of zero. Credit: RMIT University Scientists have discovered honeybees can understand the concept of zero, putting them in an elite club of clever animals that can grasp the abstract mathematical notion of nothing.      By demonstrating that even tiny brains can comprehend complex, abstract concepts, the surprise finding opens possibilities for new, simpler approaches to developing Artificial Intelligence.      In research published in the journal Science, Australian and French researchers tested whether honey bees can rank numerical quantities and understand that zero belongs at the lower end of a sequence of numbers.      Associate Professor Adrian Dyer, from RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, said the number zero was the backbone of modern maths and technological advancements.      \\"Zero is a difficult concept to understand and a mathematical skill that doesn't come easily—it takes children a few years to learn,\\" Dyer said.      \\"We've long believed only humans had the intelligence to get the concept, but recent research has shown monkeys and birds have the brains for it as well.      \\"What we haven't known—until now—is whether insects can also understand zero.\\"      As well as being a critical pollinator, the honeybee is an exceptional model species for investigating insect cognition, with previous research showing they can learn intricate skills from other bees and even understand abstract concepts like sameness and difference.      Trained to pick the lowest number out of a series of options, a honeybee chooses a blank image, revealing an understanding of the concept of zero. Credit: RMIT University      But bee brains have fewer than 1 million neurons—compared with the 86,000 million neurons of a human brain—and little was known about how insect brains would cope with being tested on such an important numeric skill.      RMIT Ph.D. researcher Scarlett Howard set out to test the honeybee on its understanding, marking individual honeybees for easy identification and luring them to a specially-designed testing apparatus.      The bees were trained to choose an image with the lowest number of elements in order to receive a reward of sugar solution.      For example, the bees learned to choose three elements when presented with three vs. four; or two elements when presented with two vs. three.      When Howard periodically tested the bees with an image that contained no elements versus an image that had one or more, the bees understood that the set of zero was the lower number—despite never having been exposed to an \\"empty set\\".

Credit: Composite image by Scarlett Howard, Jair Garcia and Adrian Dyer      Dyer, a researcher in the Bio Inspired Digital Sensing-Lab (BIDS-Lab) in RMIT's Digital Ethnography Research Centre, said the findings opened the door to new understandings of how different brains could represent zero.      \\"This is a tricky neuroscience problem,\\" he said.      \\"It is relatively easy for neurons to respond to stimuli such as light or the presence of an object but how do we, or even an insect, understand what nothing is?      \\"How does a brain represent nothing? Could bees and other animals that collect lots of food items, have evolved special neural mechanisms to enable the perception of zero?      \\"If bees can learn such a seemingly advanced maths skill that we don't even find in some ancient human cultures, perhaps this opens the door to considering the mechanism that allows animals and ourselves to understand the concept of nothing.\\"      An individually marked honeybee inspects stimuli with either 3 or 4 elements before choosing to land on the correct “lower” number. After learning this type of rule with many combinations, bees understand that an unfamiliar presentation of an empty set is less than any other number of elements presented. Credit: Scarlett Howard      One of the problems in the development of artificial intelligence is enabling robots to operate in very complex environments, Dyer said.      \\"Crossing a road is simple for adult humans, we understand if there are no approaching cars, no bikes or trams, then it is probably ok to cross,\\" he said.      \\"But what is zero, how do we represent this for so many complex object classes to make decisions in complex environments?      \\"If bees can perceive zero with a brain of less than a million neurons, it suggests there are simple efficient ways to teach AI new tricks.\\"      The research was conducted in both Australia and France and involved many control experiments to validate the findings.      Study co-author, Dr. Aurore Avarguès-Weber from the University of Toulouse in France, said: \\"The discovery that bees can show such elaborated understanding of numbers was really surprising given their tiny brain.\\"      \\"Large brains are thus not necessary to play with numbers. This capacity is therefore probably shared by many other animals.\\"      The paper \\"Numerical ordering of zero in honeybees\\" is published in Science today.

Howard el al., \\"Numerical ordering of zero in honey bees,\\" Science (2018). science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi … 1126/science.aar4975       ||||| Understanding zero      It has been said that the development of an understanding of zero by society initiated a major intellectual advance in humans, and we have been thought to be unique in this understanding. Although recent research has shown that some other vertebrates understand the concept of the “empty set,” Howard et al. now show that an understanding of this concept is present in untrained honey bees (see the Perspective by Nieder). This finding suggests that such an understanding has evolved independently in distantly related species that deal with complexity in their environments, and that it may be more widespread than previously appreciated.      Science, this issue p. 1124; see also p. 1069 ||||| Humans aren't the only species that can ponder abstract mathematical concepts like nonexistence. In addition to some other animals, honeybees understand that the number zero is less than 1, according to a new study.      Dolphins, African gray parrots and nonhuman primates also understand the idea of \\"zero,\\" but researchers were surprised to find that honeybees also comprehend this concept, considering the insects' tiny brains, according to a statement from RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia.      Honeybees have fewer than 1 million neurons, compared with the 86 billion neurons in humans — and yet, they grasp a concept that humans, by some measures, don't start to understand before preschool, according to NPR.      The researchers set up two cards, each of which had a set of symbols on them, like triangles or circles. Then, they trained a group of the bees to fly to the card with the lower number of symbols. (The bees quickly learned what the humans wanted them to do to get their delicious, sugary rewards).      The trained bees were then shown a card that was empty versus one that had symbols on it. Without any prior training, the bees flew more often to the empty card — thereby demonstrating that they understood that \\"zero\\" was a number less than the others, according to the study, which was published Thursday (June 7) in the journal Science.      Although they flew more often to an empty card than to one that had one symbol on it, it became easier for them to differentiate when the symbols' card increased in number. For example, they more often flew to the zero when the other card had four symbols than when it had one, according to NPR.      Perhaps these findings will shed light on the brain mechanism behind what allows us to understand the concept of \\"nothing,\\" Adrian Dyer, a researcher at RMIT University and senior author of the study, said in the RMIT statement. This understanding, in turn, could help in the development of artificial intelligence that also understands this concept.      \\"If bees can perceive zero with a brain of less than a million neurons, it suggests there are simple, efficient ways to teach AI new tricks,\\" Dyer said in the statement.

Here are possible answers to this question: - expensive - wolf - wool - goat - lamb  I believe the correct choice is \\"expensive\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"When you go to buy a sheep, you will learn that it is \\"expensive.\\" Here's why: Sheep are considered expensive for a variety of reasons. First and foremost, the cost of a sheep can be high, depending on its breed, age, and purpose. Purebred sheep and those bred for specific purposes, such as wool production or meat, can carry a significantly higher price tag. Additionally, some sheep breeds are rare or have special characteristics, which can also increase their price. Another factor that contributes to the expense of owning a sheep is the cost of maintenance and care. Sheep require a proper diet, which includes quality hay, grains, and clean water. They also may need supplements or mineral blocks, depending on their specific needs. The cost of these resources can add up over time. Adequate space and suitable shelter are also essential for keeping sheep healthy and comfortable. Providing enough fenced land can be an expensive investment, as well as securing proper housing that offers protection against the elements and potential predators. Sheep are also susceptible to a range of health issues and diseases, which can lead to veterinary costs. Regular check-ups, vaccinations, and preventative treatments are important for maintaining their health but can be expensive. Furthermore, sheep need regular shearing, hoof trimming, and other forms of care that may require the service of professionals, adding to the overall cost of ownership. In summary, when you go to buy a sheep, you will learn that it is expensive due to the initial purchase price, the cost of food and supplies, the need for appropriate space and shelter, and the array of health and maintenance costs that come with owning a sheep."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Negotiate and finalize terms: Representatives from the participating parties must discuss, negotiate, and reach consensus on any elements that require further clarification or revision. 3. Insert the eschatocol: At the end of the treaty, insert the eschatocol clause, such as \\"in witness whereof\\" or \\"in faith whereof.\\" This clause signifies the conclusion of the treaty. 4. Signatures: The parties then affix their signatures, indicating their consent and commitment to the terms outlined in the treaty. 5. Specify the location and date of execution: Following the signatures, include the words \\"DONE at,\\" and then specify the site(s) of the treaty's execution and the date(s) of its execution. The date is typically written in its most formal, longest possible form (e.g., \\"the twenty-sixth day of June, one thousand nine hundred and forty-five\\"). 6. Acknowledge multiple languages (if applicable): If the treaty is executed in multiple copies in different languages, note this fact and add a stipulation that the versions in different languages are equally authentic. By following these steps, the treaty is effectively concluded, and the participating parties are committed to upholding its terms and conditions as agreed upon."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

When Kelly Lynn Miller appeared at a press conference in Thailand on Wednesday, the American fugitive didn't appear to take the hearing about her extradition very seriously - resting her head on her hands in boredom and casually applying lip-gloss through the proceedings. Authorities say the 36-year-old has been on the run for six years after fleeing the U.S. to avoid a five-year prison sentence for killing truck driver Donald Goodwin, 57, in a 2004 drunk-driving accident. She managed to evade detection, and even give birth recently, by constantly moving around a set of Thai islands. On Thursday, Goodwin's younger sister Faye Dees spoke out to the Daily Mail Online, saying she wasn't at all surprised by Miller's nonchalant behavior in Thailand based on how she reacted to her brother's death and interacted with the family at trial nearly a decade ago.Fugitive Kelly Lynn Miller, 36, was arrested in Thailand this weekShe was convicted of mowing down 57-year-old trucker Donald Goodwin in 2004 drunk-driving accident but never reported to prisonOn Thursday, Goodwin's sister Faye Dees, 66, spoke with the Daily Mail Online about her happiness that Miller has finally been capturedDees remarked that pictures of Miller in Thailand, looking unmoved by her arrest and imminent extradition, were not surprising   Question:_ left behind a son now in his 30s, also named Donald, and was divorced.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","output":"When a bigger tray is used for baking a cake, it will have a direct effect on the amount of cake batter needed to fill the pan. As the size of the tray increases, the volume of the cake pan will also increase, resulting in a requirement for more material (cake batter) to sufficiently fill the pan.  The second effect mentioned in the process is the greasing of the cake pan. The perturbation of using a bigger tray will lead to a larger surface area for the pan, necessitating more grease, butter, or non-stick spray to coat the entire surface. This is important for preventing the cake from sticking to the pan when it is removed after baking. Thus, the supposed perturbation of using a bigger tray will have a direct effect on both the amount of cake batter and the amount of grease required to carry out the baking process. Specifically, a larger tray will require more cake batter and more grease, butter, or non-stick spray to ensure proper baking and easy removal of the cake from the pan after baking."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When American 11 struck the World Trade Center at 8:46, no one in the White House or traveling with the President knew that it had been hijacked. While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46. Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center. The Vice President was wondering \\"How the hell could a plane hit the World Trade Center\\" when he saw the second aircraft strike the South Tower. Elsewhere in the White House, a series of 9:00 meetings was about to begin. In the absence of information that the crash was anything other than an accident, the White House staff monitored the news as they went ahead with their regular schedules.  After reading the above, is \\"\\"it must have been a hijacking\\"\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What was the White House response to the initial reports of the crash?\\"?","output":"No, \\"it must have been a hijacking\\" is not the correct answer to the question \\"What was the White House response to the initial reports of the crash?\\" Based on the information provided, the initial response from the White House and President Bush was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error.

Această politică a avut ca rezultat exodul a numeroși non-musulmani, în principal creștini și evrei, care au fost supuși unor presiuni și discriminări.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Avoid drastic measures that could cause rapid weight loss in your cat. This could lead to a serious liver condition called hepatic lipidosis, where excess fat that is broken down accumulates in the liver. This makes your cat feel ill and decreases his appetite, setting up a vicious cycle of more body fat breakdown and fat accumulating in the liver. If you suspect your cat has hepatic lipidosis, get your cat prompt medical treatment at a veterinary hospital. It's a life-threatening condition that requires immediate treatment. Overweight cats are more likely to develop diabetes, where the body doesn't create or manage insulin and blood sugar levels properly. If a cat develops diabetes, it may be manageable through gradual weight loss and a high-protein diet  alone, while other cats will need daily insulin injections by their owners for the rest of their life. Obese cats are also at risk to develop painful osteoarthritis due to years of excess weight stressing the bones and joints. In addition, they are at risk of developing high blood pressure, heart disease, and some forms of cancer. Obese and overweight cats have a tendency to be less energetic, sleep more, and have fewer interactions with their families. This is how they get the reputation of being fat and lazy. The vet will do a thorough examination to make sure there are no underlying health issues. The vet can then guide you on to the type and amount of food you should feed your cat. You'll also be told how much weight your cat should lose each month and how much weight he should lose overall. Your vet will probably recommend that your cat lose a quarter pound a week or one pound a month, depending on your cat's frame, size, breed, and sex. You may want to get a measuring cup with 1/8th measure increments. This will help measure the appropriate amount of food for your cat. Look for commercial cat foods that are high in fiber and can be fed \\"as-is\\" or mix 1 to 2 teaspoons of a powdered fiber supplement into wet food. You can also feed 1 to 2 tablespoons of canned plain pumpkin to add fiber to a regular diet. If you add powdered fiber or pumpkin instead of the commercial high-fiber food, cut back on the amount of cat food by 1 to 2 tablespoons at the same time.  If you're having trouble getting your cat to eat the less flavorful high-fiber food, add a little water that's been drained off of a can of tuna. This can entice your cat to eat it. Fiber is an important form of carbohydrate that will take a while for your cat to digest, making him feel fuller without contributing too many calories. High-fiber foods will give important nutrients and keep your cat from eating too many calories. Look for a commercially prepared high-protein food or have a trained pet nutritionist create a homemade diet for your cat. This is important because cats need the amino acid taurine in their diets or they'll develop heart and vision problems. While high-protein foods are generally tastier for cats, they might not be as filling or satisfying to a cat used to eating more food.  Note that a cat with kidney disease should not be placed on a high protein diet since it will further damage the kidneys. If you do chose to gradually switch cat food, do so over a period of one to two weeks. The first two days mix ¼ new food with ¾ old food. The next four days mix ½ new food with ½ old food. The next 2 to 4 days mix ¾ new food with ¼ old food. If the cat leaves the old food in the dish, make a more gradual transition to the new food. If he absolutely refuses the new food consult your veterinarian for advice. You might try keeping your cat's regular food, just offering a smaller portion. Use the measuring cup to measure out the recommended amount on the cat food label and feed that amount. If it's more than what your cat normally eats, cut down accordingly, since some manufacturers are fairly generous in their serving sizes. A good rule of thumb is to decrease the amount of food fed by 10%. It is important to understand that if your cat was used to having food available  to eat at all times, you will need to begin feeding your cat two or three times a day. Since your cat has been overeating, you need to control feeding times. Before starting your cat on a diet, write down your cat's weight on a calendar or notebook. Weigh your cat every week while he's dieting. It's easy to do this by holding your cat in your arms, stepping on a bathroom scale and then weighing yourself after you place the cat down. Subtract this number from your first number to give you your cat’s weight.  Remember the goal is for your cat to lose no more than ¼ pound a week or 1 pound a month. If you find after two weeks that no weight has been lost, cut down portion sizes by 10%. If your cat still hasn't lost weight after 2 more weeks, talk again with your veterinarian.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose unpopularity led the locals to parade an effigy of him around the town each Easter Monday and collect money? from the following article ?  The Domesday Survey of 1086 does not directly mention Ashton, perhaps because only a partial survey of the area had been taken. However, it is thought that St Michael's Church, mentioned in the Domesday entry for the ancient parish of Manchester, was in Ashton (also spelt Asheton, Asshton and Assheton). The town itself was first mentioned in the 12th century when the manor was part of the barony of Manchester. By the late 12th century, a family who adopted the name Assheton held the manor on behalf of the Gresleys, barons of Manchester. Ashton Old Hall was a manor house, the administrative centre of the manor, and the seat of the de Ashton or de Assheton family. With three wings, the hall was \\"one of the finest great houses in the North West\\" of the 14th century. It has been recognised as important for being one of the few great houses in south-east Lancashire and possibly one of the few halls influenced by French design in the country. The town was granted a Royal Charter in 1414, which allowed it to hold a fair twice a year, and a market on every Monday, making the settlement a market town.According to popular tradition, Sir Ralph de Assheton, who was lord of the manor in the mid-14th century and known as the Black Knight, was an unpopular and cruel feudal lord. After his death, his unpopularity led the locals to parade an effigy of him around the town each Easter Monday and collect money. Afterwards the effigy would be hung up, shot, and set on fire, before being torn apart and thrown into the crowd. The first recorded occurrence of the event was in 1795, although the tradition may be older; it continued into the 1830s.The manor remained in the possession of the Assheton family until 1514 when its male line terminated. The lordship of the manor passed to Sir George Booth, great-great grandson of Sir Thomas Ashton, devolving through the Booth family until the Earls of Stamford inherited it through marriage in 1758.

This decision, which has been lauded by human rights organizations and peace advocates from around the world, is a significant step towards building a safer and more just global society. Landmines have long been a scourge to humanity, causing devastating harm to thousands of innocent civilians every year, particularly in war-torn regions. It is unfortunate that, despite efforts to mitigate their impact, these cruel devices continue to plague communities even after the conflicts have subsided. The European Union's decision to impose an outright ban on the export of landmines aims to target the root of this issue, significantly reducing the number of devices available for use. The European Union's bold move to outlaw the export of landmines underscores its commitment to preventing their proliferation and usage around the globe. This reflects the EU's dedication to respecting humanitarian principles and preserving peace, while protecting the fundamental human rights of those most vulnerable to the lethal effects of these weapons. Additionally, it is critical to note that the recent ban on landmine exports is just one aspect of the EU's broader strategy to deter the production, acquisition, and trade of military assets that can inflict colossal damage to innocent lives. Some key factors contributing to the decision of the EU to impose this ban include increased public awareness surrounding the deadly effects of landmines, the desire to embrace a more sustainable approach to preserving global security and stability, and the willingness to adhere to international norms and treaties. The 1997 Ottawa Treaty, also known as the Mine Ban Treaty, specifically calls for the absolute prohibition of the use, production, and transfer of anti-personnel landmines, and has been ratified by a majority of world nations. The European Union's recent move signifies its complete adherence to the provisions outlined in this treaty. This major development comes at a time when the world is grappling with pressing security challenges, such as armed conflict, terrorism, and organized crime. In this context, the European Union's ban on the export of landmines sends a powerful message of unity and solidarity, demonstrating that their member states are determined to confront these challenges and ensure a more humane and secure environment for everyone. As part of this initiative, the EU is also committed to funding and supporting demining operations worldwide. By offering assistance in the form of finance, education, and technical expertise, the European Union aims to dismantle existing landmines and help affected communities heal from their tragic consequences. In conclusion, the European Union's bold and historic decision to ban the export of anti-personnel landmines marks a significant step in the global effort to eradicate these deadly weapons. It is crucial that other nations follow suit and collaborate to put an end to the landmine menace once and for all. This multifaceted approach, which combines stringent controls on landmine production and exports along with comprehensive support for demining efforts worldwide, is an exemplary model for how the global community can join forces to safeguard innocent lives and create a more peaceful world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Amy pointed out the pleiades star cluster to Megan because","output":"it was the first time Megan had shown interest in learning about the celestial objects in the night sky. The Pleiades star cluster, also known as the Seven Sisters, M45, or even Subaru in Japanese, is one of the most easily identifiable and well-known star clusters visible to the naked eye. The enthusiasm in Megan's eyes shone just as brightly as the stars, and this sight, Amy knew, would truly captivate her newfound interest. The Pleiades star cluster is located in the constellation of Taurus, approximately 444 light-years away from Earth. It is a prominent sight in the winter sky of the Northern Hemisphere and can be found by first identifying the familiar constellation of Orion. From Orion's belt, a line extending through the bright star Aldebaran (also part of Taurus) leads directly to this enchanting cluster. Amy began by explaining the mythology behind the Pleiades, which varies across different cultures. The most common story is derived from Greek mythology, which tells of the seven sisters pursued by the hunter Orion, who were transformed into doves by Zeus and placed in the night sky to escape his advances. She then went on to describe the scientific nature of the star cluster. Formed from the same cosmic cloud around 100 million years ago, Pleiades consists mainly of young, hot, blue-white stars, which have yet to exhaust their reserves of hydrogen fuel. Despite being referred to as the Seven Sisters, the star cluster contains over 800 stars, but only a handful are visible to the naked eye. The apparent member stars are Alcyone, Atlas, Electra, Maia, Merope, Taygeta, and Pleione, with each name rooted in the Greek mythology Amy had previously mentioned. Amy also shared her knowledge about the nebulosity surrounding the Pleiades star cluster, which is composed of fine dust particles that reflect the radiant blue light from the stars. These dust particles are the remnants of the vast molecular cloud that birthed the stars, and the ongoing interaction between the stars and dust creates the glowing phenomenon observed in long-exposure photographs. As Amy conveyed her passion for astronomy to Megan, they both marveled at the indigo splendor of the Pleiades star cluster in the crisp winter sky. They discussed its importance in ancient cultures, as it was often used as a celestial calendar and a reference point for navigation. The two young women stood there, immersed in their newfound celestial bond, as each star of the Pleiades twinkled back at them like a sisterhood traversing space and time. With each minute spent beneath the cold but captivating night sky, Megan became more and more awestruck by the magnificence of the stars. Amy shared more fascinating astronomical facts and folklore, delving deeper into the history and science that enveloped them on that crystal-clear night. Thus began Megan's lifelong interest in astronomy, initiated by her first enchanting encounter with the Pleiades star cluster. And as future celestial events unfolded, like meteor showers, eclipses, and planetary conjunctions, Megan and Amy would come together many times more, united by their love for the cosmos and the unending desire to learn and explore its secrets. It became a ritual for them, a reminder of the night their friendship had grown stronger under the spell of the Seven Sisters. Together, they fostered a love for mankind's earliest obsession: understanding the wonders and mysteries written in the ever-expanding tome that is the night sky."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Options:  A. hen house  B. painting  C. virginia  D. california  E. lion's den","output":"The most logical option in line with common sense for George to pursue his interest in hunting foxes would be option C: Virginia.  If we evaluate each option, we can deduce the following: A. Hen House: A hen house is primarily meant for keeping chickens or hens and providing a place for them to lay eggs. It would be an unlikely place to find foxes, as they would prey on the chickens and probably be deterred from the area by the owners. B. Painting: A painting is a piece of visual artwork, and therefore, it cannot provide a physical location for George to hunt foxes. He could admire an image of fox hunting in a painting, but it doesn't serve the purpose of finding a real-life location to hunt. C. Virginia: Virginia is a state located in the southeastern United States, known for its diverse landscapes, natural habitats, and wildlife. The state is home to a variety of wildlife species, including foxes, making it a plausible location for George to partake in fox hunting. Hunting foxes is a traditional rural activity in Virginia, and the state has designated hunting seasons and regulations to manage the fox population. D. California: Although California is known for its diverse wildlife and various ecosystems, it is less commonly associated with fox hunting compared to Virginia. While it might be possible for George to hunt foxes here, it wouldn't necessarily be the best option when compared to Virginia's rich fox hunting heritage and established hunting practices. E. Lion's Den: A lion's den refers to the dwelling of lions and can also be a metaphor for a dangerous or hostile environment. This would be an unlikely place for George to hunt foxes, as lions and foxes typically reside in different habitats and geographical locations. Additionally, the presence of lions would imply a more dangerous environment for George and may deter him from entering to hunt foxes. In conclusion, based on the available options, the most sensible choice for George to pursue his interest in hunting foxes would be Virginia. The state is known for its diverse wildlife, including foxes, and is more commonly linked to fox hunting tradition. It provides an appropriate environment with established hunting practices, regulations, and seasons that would likely allow George the best opportunity to partake in his preferred activity."},{"instruction":"Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the scientific name of the kongoni?, using the article: The hartebeest (; Alcelaphus buselaphus), also known as kongoni, is an African antelope.

A large antelope, the hartebeest stands just over 1 m (3.3 ft) at the shoulder, and has a typical head-and-body length of 200 to 250 cm (79 to 98 in). The weight ranges from 100 to 200 kg (220 to 440 lb). It has a particularly elongated forehead and oddly shaped horns, short neck, and pointed ears. Its legs, which often have black markings, are unusually long. The coat is generally short and shiny. Coat colour varies by the subspecies, from the sandy brown of the western hartebeest to the chocolate brown of the Swayne's hartebeest. Both sexes of all subspecies have horns, with those of females being more slender. Horns can reach lengths of 45–70 cm (18–28 in). Apart from its long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back differentiate the hartebeest from other antelopes. Gregarious animals, hartebeest form herds of 20 to 300 individuals. They are very alert and non-aggressive. They are primarily grazers, with their diets consisting mainly of grasses. Mating in hartebeest takes place throughout the year with one or two peaks, and depends upon the subspecies and local factors. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age.

Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","output":"In order to determine a more sound solution for removing pet hair from furniture and clothes based on naive physics reasoning, we need to consider the primary factor ingrained in naive physics: common sense understanding and experiences rather than scientific explanations. Here, I will present and analyze both the solutions: Solution 1: Using a Lint Roller or Tape A lint roller is designed specifically to remove hair, lint, and other debris from fabrics and surfaces. The roller has a sticky adhesive layer that efficiently picks up pet hair when rolled over the surface of the furniture or clothes. The effectiveness of the lint roller is based on its adhesive properties and how well it can capture the hair. The use of a lint roller requires physical effort, but it is easy to manipulate and control on varied surfaces. Additionally, tape can serve a similar purpose, especially if wrapped around your hand with the sticky side out. Pressing it against the fabric picks-up pet hair effectively. Solution 2: Using a Vacuum Cleaner with a Brush Attachment A vacuum cleaner is an electric device that uses suction to remove dust or debris from surfaces. Most vacuum cleaners come with a brush attachment, which is designed specifically to pick up hair and other deeply embedded dirt from upholstery, furniture, carpets, or clothing. The system works by agitation caused by the bristles and a strong suction force to lift the hair from the surface. Using a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment is effective, easy to use, and often more time-efficient for larger areas. However, it might also require electricity and proper maintenance of the vacuum cleaner (e.g. cleaning the filters and emptying the bin). After analyzing both solutions, I would conclude that Solution 2 - Using a Vacuum Cleaner with a Brush Attachment, is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning. The rationale behind this choice is based on common everyday experiences, it covers the practicality of usage, efficiency, and ability to tackle larger areas in less time. It also takes into account the effectiveness of combining the agitation caused by brush bristles and the suction power provided by the vacuum cleaner. Nevertheless, the choice of the ideal solution depends on individual preferences, availability of resources, and specific situations. A lint roller or tape might be a better choice for quick fixes, spot cleaning, or smaller surfaces, while a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment works better for overall cleanliness and deep cleaning of larger areas."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A questionable role in the rebellion was played by Leonard Dacre, an early sympathiser of Mary. At the outbreak of the rebellion, he travelled to Elizabeth's court at Windsor to claim the heritage of his young nephew, the 5th Baron Dacre. After the latter's untimely death in 1569, this had descended to his sisters, all married to sons of the Duke of Norfolk. Dacre returned to Northern England, ostensibly a faithful partisan of Elizabeth, but his intentions remain unclear. After the retreat of the rebels, he seized Greystoke Castle and fortified his own Naworth Castle, where he gathered 3,000 Cumbrian troops and tried to keep up the appearance of good relations with the Queen. He held out against a siege of the royal army under Baron Hunsdon but then attacked the retreating army at Gelt River. Though Hunsdon was outnumbered, he charged Dacre's foot with his cavalry, killing 300-400 and capturing 200-300 men. Dacre escaped via Scotland to Flanders, where he died in exile.

Chinese Influences: The Japanese were forced out of the Korean peninsula in the sixth century, but not before the Koreans had bequeathed to the Yamato court copies of the sacred images and scriptures of Chinese Buddhism. Just as Christianity introduced Mediterranean culture into northern Europe, so Buddhism brought Chinese culture into Japanese society. Throughout the seventh and eighth centuries numerous Japanese monks, scholars, and artists made the perilous trip west across the Sea of Japan to study Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and painting — later to be brought back for further development in Japan. An outstanding figure of this time was Prince Shotoku, who in 604 developed the \\"Seventeen-Article Constitution,\\" outlining a code of human conduct and the ideals of state as a basic law for the nation. He also established relations with the Sui dynasty in China. Through him, the Japanese imperial court developed Chinese patterns of centralized government, with its formal bureaucracy of eight court ranks. The Chinese calendar was used to calculate the year of Japan's foundation by counting back the 1,260 years of the Chinese cosmological cycle. Thus, 660 b.c. is still the official date celebrated nationwide. At this early stage in its history Japan was already (for the most part) only nominally ruled by the emperor. De facto power was exercised by the militarily and economically strongest family. The Sogas had promoted Buddhism as an imperially sanctioned counterweight to the native Shinto religion, along with the new Chinese customs, to weaken the influence of their more conservative rivals. But they in turn were ousted in a.d. 645 by Nakatomi Kamatari, founder of the great Fujiwara clan, which was to rule Japanese affairs for hundreds of years and provide prominent advisers to the emperor even up to the 19th century.  Question: \\"How did Buddhism bring Chinese culture to Japanese society?\\" Answer: \\"Japanese monks, scholars and artists went west to study in China and then returned to Japan with what they had learned\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"Yes, that's correct! Just like traveling to a far-away place to learn new things, Japanese monks, scholars, and artists went to China and learned about Chinese culture, religion, and arts. When they came back to Japan, they shared all these interesting things they had learned with other people, and that's how Buddhism helped bring Chinese culture to Japanese society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Carrie bought two parcels of farmland. The Northern one had soil with lots of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, while the Southern parcel  had almost no traces of AM fungi.  Hint: Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi vary across many environmental gradients. Their tolerance to freezing and drying is known to shift between AM fungal taxa. AM fungi become less prevalent and diverse at higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations, presumably because both plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi and AM fungi reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae in these environmental conditions. Over the long term, these environmental conditions can even create local adaptation between plant hosts, AM fungi and the local soil nutrient concentrations. A:","output":"Based on the given information, the Southern parcel had a higher soil nutrient content.

Based on the provided information, it is reasonable to conclude that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) provides a wealth of necessary information. Beyond simply generating this information, the GAO ensures that it is effectively packaged to support the oversight work of several congressional committees.  The GAO, an independent, nonpartisan agency that works for Congress, often called the \\"congressional watchdog,\\" aids Congress in fulfilling its legislative mandate by providing information intended to improve the performance and ensure the accountability of the federal government. It has broad authority to review the activities of various Agencies and programs, examining all facets of government, from evaluating the effectiveness of policy implementation to financial management practices. The management reforms of the 1990s aimed to improve government performance, a task that required a considerable amount of investigation, data collection, and reporting by the GAO. Therefore, it can be deduced that the GAO has, and continues to, provide a large amount of essential information. This information plays a crucial role as it contributes to improving the efficiency, transparency, and accountability of government agencies and programs. It supports the work of policymakers and legislators who rely on accurate, thorough, and unbiased information to make informed decisions. In summary, the Government Accountability Office not only provides a great deal of necessary information but also ensures it is effectively disseminated to those who need it, such as congressional committees tasked with government oversight.

But when winter comes around, it is wet, windy and cold. Since they can't go outside to play, kids get restless and miserable. Fun activities for kids are pretty much necessary at that time of year, and they need to be kept entertained. One way to do this is to have an indoor treasure hunt, where children can look for clues and then get to the treasure. Treasure doesn't even need to be much, because just the activity is fun enough. Art activities are always fun, and if you start off with some paper in different colors they can draws shapes on the back, cut them out and stick them on the white paper to make all sorts of things. Cardboard boxes, stuck together and then painted, can be made into buildings or robots. You can keep all boxes in a bag in the loft. Then you have something you can draw on when the weather is bad and the children need to play indoors. Dressing up is another fun indoor activity. Why not read a book to them and then ask them to act it for you? That can keep them busy and develop their imagination. When you encourage children to use their imagination, you are giving them confidence in themselves, in their own creative abilities; by suggesting they put on a play you are encouraging them to work together and develop teamwork skills. The best way to help your kids have fun when it is rainy outside is to let them come up with some ideas.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Counter-Attack Context: In 1942, both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union are gathering forces and supplies in one particular sector of the Eastern Front for a major attack. The Soviets are secretly constructing a bridge at night over a river. To avoid detection, it is being built underwater, just below the surface. In an attempt to find out where the Germans plan to strike, Colonel Semenov (George Macready) has a small paratrooper unit dropped behind enemy lines to attack a divisional headquarters and hopefully take an officer prisoner for interrogation. The local partisans, led by the wily Kostyuk (Roman Bohnen), provide a guide, Lisa Elenko (Marguerite Chapman). The attack succeeds at first. Alexei Kulkov (Paul Muni), one of the paratroopers, takes seven Germans prisoner in the basement. Then, just as Elenko brings him a message, German artillery hits the building, causing it to collapse and trap them in the spacious cellar. Afterward, Kulkov's dog sniffs out where his master is buried and starts digging. This alerts one of Kulkov's comrades, who communicates with him by tapping on a metal pipe in code. Learning that Kulkov has caught an officer, he leaves to get help. Kulkov is in no hurry to dig out. Though the prisoners rank no higher than a sergeant, he is convinced one of them is an officer in disguise, based on a pistol and a monocle he has found. He begins questioning the men one by one, but while he rules out ex-miner Stillman (Rudolph Anders) and a former magician (Philip Van Zandt), he cannot pinpoint his man. An eighth German soldier, thought to be dead, wakes up and attacks. In the struggle, the lone lantern is extinguished and Elenko is stabbed in the shoulder. However, Kulkov kills him and regains control of the situation. Oddly, Elenko is certain that one of the Germans tried to help her in the darkness. Kulkov decides to try a ploy. He orders the magician to go around the corner of the main room out of sight of the others. He knocks the German out and then fires one round, making the rest think he has exacted... The answer is:","output":"In the movie Counter-Attack, Germany and the Soviet Union are gathering forces and supplies in a particular sector of the Eastern Front, where the Soviets are secretly constructing an underwater bridge at night over a river. The location is not explicitly mentioned, and thus it is difficult to provide more specific details on the region. Both the German and Soviet forces are preparing for a major attack in this area, which eventually leads to the significant events that take place throughout the movie. The primary focus of the film's plot is the operation led by Colonel Semenov to discover Germany's battle plans. His strategy involves deploying a paratrooper unit, including Alexei Kulkov, behind enemy lines to attack a German divisional headquarters and capture an officer for interrogation. With the aid of local partisans and their guide, Lisa Elenko, the paratroopers successfully infiltrate the German headquarters and engage with the enemy forces. During the subsequent battles and skirmishes that occur, Kulkov manages to take seven Germans as prisoners while being trapped in the cellar of a building that collapses due to an artillery strike. By questioning the captive Germans, Kulkov attempts to identify any disguised officers among them. He believes that one of them is secretly an officer based on the possession of a pistol and monocle. As the film progresses, Kulkov employs various tactics to obtain crucial information on the German plans for attack. These efforts include interrogating the captives, using their unique skills to his advantage, and manipulating the situation to gain their trust. Amidst this tense standoff, Kulkov eventually unveils a significant discovery – one of the Germans might have attempted to help Elenko during a scuffle in the dark. The movie Counter-Attack offers an intense and engaging look into the high-stakes battles and espionage activities that transpired between Germany and the Soviet Union during World War II. While it is difficult to pinpoint the exact location of their troop buildup and supply gathering based on the film's narrative, the Eastern Front sector serves as the backdrop for the unfolding drama and suspense."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices:  - office suite - his textbook - binder - math class - notebook  The rationale to choose \\"notebook\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"The rationale to choose \\"notebook\\" as the answer to this question is based on the function and purpose of a divider and the context provided. When James put a divider between arithmetic and English, this action essentially helped him separate and organize the content of these two different subjects. By doing this, he could continue using the same resource efficiently while distinguishing one subject from another. Now, let's examine the given choices in-depth and understand why \\"notebook\\" is the most appropriate answer: 1. Office suite: An office suite is a collection of productivity software, including applications like word processors, spreadsheets, and presentation software. While they are useful tools, they don't precisely fit the context provided in the question. 2. His textbook: A textbook is typically a resource specifically dedicated to a particular subject, which means it already has a built-in segregation of content for each subject. Moreover, textbooks don't usually allow adding dividers since their content is fixed. Therefore, this choice is not the most suitable answer in this situation. 3. Binder: A binder is a possible option because it can hold multiple subjects' notes and has the flexibility to add dividers. However, the context given in the question is more suggestive of using an existing resource, rather than merely segregating subjects. While the binder could be an answer, there is a more fitting option available. 4. Math class: This choice seems unrelated to the context provided. The question deals with organizing different subjects' content rather than the act of attending a class. Thus, math class is not an appropriate answer. 5. Notebook: Finally, a notebook serves as a resource that allows students to take notes and record their learning across various subjects. When James uses a divider between arithmetic and English, he can organize the material more effectively and continue taking notes in the same notebook without confusing the information from the two subjects. This choice fits the context provided perfectly and considers the function of a divider. In summary, the rationale to choose \\"notebook\\" as the answer is due to the fact that it's more aligned with the context of segregating subjects' content and continues using the same resource. It also takes into account the purpose of a divider and how it can help keep information organized and manageable."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This statement refers to a proposal that is consistent with the principles set forth by the International Organization for Securities Commissions (IOSCO), which is a worldwide association of national securities regulatory agencies. These principles provide a global framework for the regulation and oversight of financial benchmarks, aimed at ensuring their integrity, reliability, and fairness. The proposal in question covers an extensive range of benchmarks, demonstrating its comprehensiveness. It does not merely focus on interest rate benchmarks such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), which is a widely-used benchmark interest rate that indicates the borrowing costs for major banks in the London market. Over the years, LIBOR has been subject to manipulation and scandal, leading to an increased need for regulatory reform and enhanced oversight. In addition to interest rate benchmarks, the proposal also encompasses commodity benchmarks. Commodity benchmarks are essential for various industries, as they provide a means to determine the market price for specific commodities like oil, gold, and agricultural products. These benchmarks serve as a reference point for pricing commodity-related financial instruments, such as futures contracts and options. Including both interest rate benchmarks and commodity benchmarks in the proposal illustrates its wide-ranging scope and its aim to address potential issues and manipulations in multiple areas of the financial market. Furthermore, by adhering to the internationally agreed-upon principles established by IOSCO, the proposal seeks to establish a consistent and robust regulatory framework across jurisdictions to promote transparency, fairness, and accuracy in the calculation and use of these essential financial benchmarks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While there is a goal at the end of their journey - they intend to work in a leper colony in Peru - the main purpose is initially fun and adventure. They desire to see as much of Latin America as they can, more than 14,000 kilometres (8,700Â mi) in just four and a half months, while Granado's purpose is also to court as many women as will fall for his pick-up lines. Their initial method of transport is Granado's dilapidated Norton 500 motorcycle christened La Poderosa (\\"The Mighty One\\"). Their planned route is ambitious, bringing them north across the Andes, along the coast of Chile, through the Atacama Desert and into the Peruvian Amazon in order to reach Venezuela just in time for Granado's 30th birthday on 2 April. However, due to La Poderosa's breakdown, they are forced to travel at a much slower pace, and don't make it to Caracas until July. During their expedition, Guevara and Granado encounter the poverty of the indigenous peasants, and the movie assumes a greater seriousness once the men gain a better sense of the disparity between the \\"haves\\" (to which they belong) and the \\"have-nots\\" (who make up the majority of those they encounter) by traveling on foot. In Chile, for instance, they encounter a penniless and persecuted couple forced onto the road because of their communist beliefs.

Other scholar-bureaucrats were wary of Wang's heterodoxy, the increasing number of his disciples while he was still in office, and his overall socially rebellious message. To curb his influence, he was often sent out to deal with military affairs and rebellions far away from the capital. Yet his ideas penetrated mainstream Chinese thought and spurred new interest in Taoism and Buddhism. Furthermore, people began to question the validity of the social hierarchy and the idea that the scholar should be above the farmer. Wang Yangming's disciple and salt-mine worker Wang Gen gave lectures to commoners about pursuing education to improve their lives, while his follower He Xinyin (何心隱) challenged the elevation and emphasis of the family in Chinese society. His contemporary Li Zhi even taught that women were the intellectual equals of men and should be given a better education; both Li and He eventually died in prison, jailed on charges of spreading \\"dangerous ideas\\". Yet these \\"dangerous ideas\\" of educating women had long been embraced by some mothers and by courtesans who were as literate and skillful in calligraphy, painting, and poetry as their male guests.The liberal views of Wang Yangming were opposed by the Censorate and by the Donglin Academy, re-established in 1604. These conservatives wanted a revival of orthodox Confucian ethics. Conservatives such as Gu Xiancheng (1550–1612) argued against Wang's idea of innate moral knowledge, stating that this was simply a legitimization for unscrupulous behavior such as greedy pursuits and personal gain. These two strands of Confucian thought, hardened by Chinese scholars' notions of obligation towards their mentors, developed into pervasive factionalism among the ministers of state, who used any opportunity to impeach members of the other faction from court.

News article: 'SUXORZ' awards reveal biggest social media fails Social media week in New York ended with the SUXORZ Awards, a (sometimes) good-natured roasting of the worst public gaffes and fails, hosted by blog advertising network Blogads. In its circus-themed event, attendees voted for their favorites by tooting party horns and tossing popcorn. (SUXORZ is an attempt at hacker-speak for things that, well... ) While the jokes were mostly on others, everyone in the room knew they could have been the brunt of this year's celebration. \\"'There but for the grace of God go I' was what most of us were feeling,\\" Henry Copeland, the event's organizer, told TechNewsDaily. \\"At the time, it seems like a good idea, but then you put it out there, the public plays with it and it turns into something entirely different.\\" - Henry Copeland, the event's organizer He pointed to Kmart's Twitter campaign, one of the nominees in the SUXORZ \\"What Were They Thinking?\\" category, which combined condolences along with a toy giveaway three hours into the Sandy Hook school shooting tragedy. \\"Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of this terrible tragedy,\\" was accompanied by #PrayforNewtown, #CTShooting and #Fab15Toys. The Twitter backlash continued for days. Copeland said that this year's event really showed how an individual can \\"kick the pants off\\" a company. The best example came from a small moving firm that sent a letter threatening blogger Phil Buckley's wife with legal action after she posted a poor review about the movers on Yelp. Buckley blogged about the incident on Twitter, Facebook and Google+. His story was covered by The Consumerist, TechDirt and Reddit. No lawsuit was filed. \\"You can really turn a little charcoal fire into a forest fire,\\" Copeland said. Here is a list of the finalists in 2012 Worst of Social Media SUXORZ Awards, chosen from each of this year's five categories: The award for \\"What were they thinking?\\" went to Belvedere Vodka for its meme-style photo tweet that offended many of the company's followers. Belvedere apologized for the tweet — which depicted a grinning man clutching a terrified-looking woman with the caption, \\"Unlike some people, Belvedere always goes down smoothly\\" — but the company's apology was brushed off by many. Samsung was recognized as the winner in the \\"Don't Piss Off Bloggers\\" category for its roughshod treatment of two Indian bloggers sent to a technology conference in Berlin on Samsung's dime. When the pair refused to wear Samsung shirts and staff the exhibit floor booth, Samsung threatened to cancel their flights back home. The bloggers tweeted about their plight and got their flight home. Mitt Romney's \\"Amercia\\" gaffe, in which the presidential candidate's team misspelled \\"America\\" in an iPhone app, won best \\"Hacks and Misfires,\\" beating out the Burger King spoof of McDonalds' Twitter page and an employee's live- tweeting of a mass firing at a video retail chain in the U.K. Romney's \\"Amercia\\" blooper also took the grand prize. For just plain \\"Lame,\\" condom maker Durex received the most toots for its series of jokes that offended many of its female followers, which its South African division tweeted in 2011. \\"Why did God give men penises? So they'd have at least one way to shut women up,\\" the company tweeted. The joke came on the eve of the government's public service campaign, 16 Days of Activism, designed to raise awareness about violence against women and children. American Apparel tried to show support for Hurricane Sandy victims while promoting a sale — the two didn't mix and customers expressed outrage on Twitter. The company won the \\"Revenge of Social\\" award for its insensitivity. The \\"Crowd Picks\\" award went to former \\"Britain's Got Talent\\" winner Susan Boyle for an unfortunate hashtag campaign #susanalbumparty, which was split up to read in a way not intended by her promoters: \\"Su's Anal Bum Party.\\" While Boyle's fame had dimmed since her rise to stardom in 2009, it took only one social media misstep to put her back in the headlines. Copeland said there are lessons from this year's winners or anyone who regularly uses social media. \\"If a company treats you badly, there's a huge amount you can do,\\" he said. \\"You really can make a difference.\\" He also cautioned people to step back and look at what's happening during the day and ask themselves, \\"Should I do something different?\\" What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"This news article talks about the SUXORZ Awards, which is an event that celebrates the biggest social media fails.

However, one can't overlook the fact that safely thawing and submerging your turkey is a crucial step before cooking the perfect turkey dinner. Although it may seem daunting, with the right guidance, anyone can master this essential technique. In this article, we'll guide you through the process of safely thawing and submerging your turkey, ensuring a delicious Thanksgiving or holiday meal for your family and friends. Preparing Your Workspace Before jumping into the process, it's essential to prepare a clean, sterile workspace to prevent any accidental bacterial contamination. 1. Remove any items or clutter from the countertops. 2. Sanitize your workspace with a mild soap solution. Afterward, rinse away the soap with water and let it dry completely. 3. Place a large cutting board on the workspace for additional protection and to catch any potential spills. Filling Your Container Select a container large enough to submerge your entire turkey. A clean ice chest, cooler, or a large pot can work effectively, as long as it's big enough to fully cover the turkey with water. 1. Thoroughly clean your chosen container with hot water and soap, making sure to rinse it well. 2. To maintain a frigid temperature in the container during the thawing process, add a thin layer of ice to the bottom. 3. Fill the container with cold water until it reaches about three-quarters of the way full. Submerging Your Turkey Now that your container is appropriately filled, it's time to submerge the turkey. 1. Remove all external packaging from the frozen turkey. 2. If it comes with a plastic truss to hold the legs and wings in place, leave it intact to help maintain the turkey's shape. 3. Gently lower the turkey into the container, ensuring it's completely submerged. Timing and Thawing The thawing process depends on the size of your turkey, but it generally takes a minimum of 30 minutes per pound of meat. Use this minimum time rule-of-thumb and check the turkey with a food thermometer, ensuring it reaches an internal temperature of 32°F before proceeding with cooking. 1. Once submerged, allow the turkey to sit in the cold water for at least half an hour, following the rule-of-thumb of 30 minutes per pound. 2. After this period, carefully remove the turkey from the container, inspecting the meat to ensure the proper internal temperature has been reached. 3. Discard the water and replace it with new cold water, repeating the layer of ice and refilling steps described earlier. Repeating the Process To maintain a safe temperature and prevent bacterial growth on the turkey, it's crucial to continue this process as needed up until you are ready to begin cooking your turkey. 1. Submerge the turkey back into the fresh container of cold water. 2. After another half hour (or however long is needed), remove and inspect the turkey for proper thawing and internal temperature. 3. Discard and replace the water and repeat the process continually, ensuring the turkey stays submerged in clean, cold water. Conclusion Although thawing and submerging your turkey may seem like a cumbersome and daunting process, with the right care and attention, you can master this essential technique. By following these steps, you're setting yourself up for a perfectly cooked turkey that is sure to delight your family and guests at your Thanksgiving or holiday meal.

Step 2: Analyze the reputation of BIT Mesra and Thapar University BIT Mesra is well-known for its Engineering and Technology disciplines and has strong industry connections. Thapar University is also considered one of the top private engineering institutions in India with a reputation for its Computer Science program. We need to consider factors like campus life, faculty, placements, and alumni network. Step 3: Compare CSE in Thapar vs IT in BIT Mesra CSE at Thapar University would provide a strong foundation in computer science and engineering, while IT at BIT Mesra would allow you to build practical skills specifically for managing and supporting information systems. If your primary interest is in computer programming, software development, and theoretical knowledge, CSE at Thapar may be the better option. If you are more focused on the practical application, network, and systems management, then IT at BIT Mesra could be a better choice. Step 4: Evaluate preferences and career goals It's essential to consider your preferences and long-term career goals. If you want a more research-oriented path or work as a software engineer, CSE could be preferable. However, if you aim to work in roles like IT manager, network architect, or systems analyst, IT would be better suited. Now, considering the steps listed above, we can address the questions you asked. Question 1: Should one prefer IT instead of CSE at BIT Mesra? Answer: It depends on your interests, preferences, and career goals. If you are more inclined towards practical applications, network, and systems management, then you may prefer IT. However, if you want a broader understanding of computer science, algorithms, and programming languages, you might choose CSE. Question 2: What should I choose, Thapar for CSE or BIT Mesra for IT and why? Answer: If you are passionate about computer programming, software development, and want a strong foundation in computer science, opt for CSE at Thapar. If you want to focus on practical applications and managing information systems, choose IT at BIT Mesra. Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same?  Answer: [-] no While both questions revolve around decision-making between IT and CSE, the questions are not the same. The first asks whether IT should be preferred over CSE at BIT Mesra, while the second is a comparison between Thapar's CSE and BIT Mesra's IT in terms of personal interests and preferences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The realization that my daughters were playing in Nancy's house, just one-half block away, paralyzed  my legs, making me unable to move when I neared the end of our driveway. Dense, black smoke was rising from behind the Sycamore Maple trees on the other side of the street and was enveloping three houses, making them barely visible. Nancy's house was one of them. I tried to call out for my daughters hoping to see them run safely to my arms, but my voice was also stuck - stuck in my throat with no intention of coming out. There I stood, helpless, paralyzed and silenced by fear, unable to protect the two little girls I loved more than even I had realized.

Answer the following question: Oxygen is essential for cellular respiration for all aerobic organisms, and aerobic organisms consume VOAs and alcohols. Given these facts, what is essential for cellular respiration for organisms consuming VOAs and alcohols among the following options: - carbon  - glucose  - h2o  - Air  - oxygen  - Energy  - Energy.  - water Answer:","output":"Oxygen is essential for cellular respiration for organisms consuming Volatile Organic Acids (VOAs) and alcohols. To understand why oxygen is essential for these organisms, let's delve into the process of cellular respiration and how VOAs and alcohols factor in. Cellular respiration is the process through which cells obtain energy, generally in the form of ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate), by breaking down molecules like carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. This process occurs in three main stages: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (or Krebs cycle), and oxidative phosphorylation (also known as the electron transport chain). Aerobic organisms are those that use oxygen in their cellular respiration process. Oxygen serves as the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain, enabling the generation of a significant amount of ATP. Without oxygen, cells would produce far less ATP through anaerobic pathways such as fermentation. Now let's consider the consumption of VOAs and alcohols. VOAs are carbon-based compounds that readily evaporate at room temperature. Examples of VOAs include alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and esters. Some microbes are capable of metabolizing VOAs and alcohols as carbon and energy sources. When these organisms metabolize VOAs and alcohols, they break them down into simpler compounds, ultimately producing molecules like Acetyl-CoA that can enter the citric acid cycle. From there, the citric acid cycle generates electron carriers such as NADH and FADH2, which are vital for oxidative phosphorylation. As mentioned earlier, oxygen is required for the final step of oxidative phosphorylation, acting as the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain. Through this process, a proton gradient is established across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The flow of protons down this gradient powers ATP synthase, generating ATP and providing energy for cellular activities. Based on this understanding, it is clear that oxygen is essential for cellular respiration for organisms consuming VOAs and alcohols. While other factors, such as carbon, glucose, water, and energy, may be involved in the overall process or life functions of these organisms, oxygen remains the critical component for efficient ATP production and the successful execution of cellular respiration in aerobic organisms consuming VOAs and alcohols."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: Most commentators have considered suicide to be the more likely cause of whose death? , can you please find it?   In September 1930 Heseltine moved with Barbara Peache into a basement flat at 12a Tite Street in Chelsea. With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \\"Bethlehem Down\\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in...

Goal: open a bottle of soda without it exploding Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","output":"Unfortunately, you haven't provided a list of methods to choose from. However, I can provide you with a detailed and long answer on how to open a bottle of soda without it exploding. Here are some tested approaches to safely open a bottle of soda without making a mess: 1. Temperature control: Before opening the bottle of soda, ensure that it is stored at the optimal temperature to prevent excessive gas buildup. The ideal temperature range typically falls between 37 to 45 degrees Fahrenheit (3 to 7 degrees Celsius). Soda temperature can have a significant impact on the pressure inside the bottle, with higher temperatures leading to more gas expansion and an increased risk of explosion. 2. Settling the soda: If the soda has been recently shaken or undergone rough handling, it is best to let it settle for a while before opening it. This will allow the gas bubbles to disperse instead of causing a sudden release of pressure when the cap is opened. A good rule of thumb is to give the bottle at least a few minutes of rest for every 10 minutes of agitation. 3. Slow release of pressure: Rather than sharply twisting the cap to remove it completely, gently and slowly twist it to gradually release the pressure. Listen carefully to the hissing sound, which indicates the gas is escaping. If you hear the hissing becoming more intense, pause for a while until the pressure diminishes, then continue twisting the cap slowly. 4. Tapping the soda bottle: You can also try tapping the bottom, sides, and top of the soda bottle gently with your fingertips. This technique is believed to help dislodge bubbles in the bottle, which can result in a smoother opening process. Be sure not to create more agitation by tapping too hard, and focus on helping bubbles adhere to the walls of the bottle without causing more buildup. 5. Holding the bottle at an angle: When you open the bottle, hold it at a 45-degree angle to prevent the soda from rushing to the opening and causing an overflow. This position will allow the gas to escape more efficiently and minimize the chances of the soda exploding. 6. Cold towel: In the case of a heavily shaken soda bottle, you can also try to wrap a cold, wet towel around the bottle for a few minutes before opening it. The idea is that the cold towel will help reduce the temperature of the soda and calm the gas bubbles down, making it safer to open. To summarize, the most reasonable methods for opening a bottle of soda without it exploding include controlling the temperature, settling the soda, slowly releasing the pressure, tapping the bottle, holding the bottle at an angle, and using a cold towel if needed. By taking these precautions, you should be able to enjoy your soda without any explosions or messes."},{"instruction":"Question: what does freedom of speech cover?

Inițiativa legislativă a cetățenilor europeni reprezintă un pas fundamental în procesul de construire a unei Europe bazate pe drepturile cetățenilor. Translate to English","output":"The European Citizens' Initiative represents a fundamental step in the process of building a Europe based on citizens' rights. The European Citizens' Initiative (ECI) is a unique and innovative instrument in the area of participatory democracy within the European Union. It allows citizens from different EU member states to come together and propose new legislation, aiming to address issues that directly affect their lives and the development of the Union. This tool aims to strengthen European democracy, foster a sense of citizenship, and bring the EU closer to its citizens. Introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon in 2007, and fully implemented in 2012, the ECI has the potential to empower citizens, offering them a more direct and tangible way to engage in decision-making at the European level. Through the ECI, citizens can gather signatures in support of a specific legislative proposal, and, once the required threshold is reached, the European Commission is obliged to consider the proposal and decide whether to draft legislation. To launch an ECI, a citizen committee must be formed, consisting of at least seven EU citizens residing in at least seven different member states. This ensures that the initiative carries transnational weight and is not limited to the concerns of one particular country. The committee must then register their proposed ECI with the European Commission, providing a clear legal basis, objectives, and background information. If approved, the committee has one year to collect the necessary signatures of support from EU citizens, which currently stands at one million, with a minimum number required from each member state. The role of the European Citizens' Initiative in the EU legislative process highlights the importance of active citizenship and engagement in shaping the future of Europe. The ECI not only creates opportunities for citizens to influence policy and legislation but also promotes a European identity by fostering cooperation and dialogue among citizens from different cultures and backgrounds. Moreover, it empowers citizens to make their voices heard on a wide range of issues, from social and economic matters to environmental and human rights concerns. Despite its potential to strengthen European democracy, the European Citizens' Initiative faces various challenges. Some of these include low public awareness, complex procedures, and the limited scope for legislative change. Since its implementation, only a few ECIs have reached the necessary threshold for consideration by the Commission, and even fewer resulted in legislative changes. Improving the transparency, accessibility, and effectiveness of the European Citizens' Initiative is essential to address these challenges and enhance citizens' trust in the European project. The recent revision of the ECI Regulation, which came into force in 2020, introduced several improvements, including simplified procedures, more accessible online tools, and increased support for organizers. These measures are a promising step towards a more inclusive and participatory Europe based on citizens' rights. In conclusion, the European Citizens' Initiative is an essential instrument in building a Europe that values and prioritizes its citizens, fostering European democracy, and making the EU more transparent and responsive to citizens' needs. To fully unlock its potential, further efforts are needed in raising awareness, simplifying procedures, and ensuring the effective implementation of successful initiatives. Embracing and promoting the European Citizens' Initiative will contribute to a more united Europe, empowered by active citizenship and rooted in the fundamental rights of its people."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: I was 35 weeks pregnant when I had my stroke. For weeks prior to the event I kept experiencing ‘visual disturbances.’ I felt when I was reading a newspaper or book a sense that my eyes were crossing. I’d feel aware right before it would occur and I would rush to look in a mirror only to discover my eyes were not crossing. I informed my OB who blamed it on the blood vessels in my eyes enlarging due to pregnancy. Ummm ok. You know more than me. Later I was told by a surgeon what I was experiencing was ‘textbook’ for the passing of blood clots through my occipital area of the brain! The feeling would eventually subside. I awoke one morning feeling ‘kind of fuzzy’ headed. Like I had slept too hard. I sat with my husband at the kitchen table for our morning coffee and newspaper and for no reason I could imagine I was unable to swallow my coffee and it dribbled out the left side of my mouth. My husband asked me what was going on and I apparently told him, I was ‘stroking’ out. He got up from the table assuming I was OK and went off to take his morning shower. While in the shower it occurred to him something might not be right. He came back to the table where I was struggling to lift myself from the chair. I put my hands on the table to lift my body and my left hand kept sliding off the edge. He finally got behind me and tried to lift me under my arms and I crumbled to the floor. He then called my OB and told him he thought I’d had a stroke. My OB immediately expressed his doubt but my husband was advised to call an ambulance to get me to the ER. I never really experienced pain from the stroke.

Considering how busy it was (not too busy), it took a pretty long time to get our food.  Each sandwich was served with a small portion of greens topped with their mustard vinaigrette.

Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government.  Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"3000\\" correctly answer the question \\"Approximately how many years passed between the Xia Dynasty and the creation of the oldest known bronze vessels in China?\\"?

The construction of gods and spirits like persons is one of the best known traits of religion. He cites examples from Greek mythology, which is, in his opinion, more like a modern soap opera than other religious systems. Bertrand du Castel and Timothy Jurgensen demonstrate through formalization that Boyer's explanatory model matches physics' epistemology in positing not directly observable entities as intermediaries.

Given the question: I have a new situation: John was studying the characteristics of tropical forests. For that, he chose forests in Laos. To compare the forests in Laos with the temperate zone forests he chose forests in Ireland. He could clearly see that how they differed in important ways.  But I can use this background: Tropical forests (rainforests) receive more insolation and rainfall over longer growing seasons than any other environment on earth. With these elevated temperatures, insolation and rainfall, biomass is extremely productive leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year. Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in forests, tropical forests have little to no podzolization and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers. Instead, the mobile metals Mg, Fe and Al are precipitated as oxide minerals giving the soil a rusty red color.  What is an answer for this question: Which forests would receive less rainfall, Laos or Ireland? The answer is:","output":"Ireland's forests would receive less rainfall compared to the tropical forests in Laos. The reason for this difference lies in the distinct climate characteristics and geographical locations of each region. Tropical forests, such as the ones found in Laos, typically experience high amounts of rainfall due to their location near the equator. This proximity causes them to receive direct sunlight and consistent heat, which in turn leads to a greater amount of evaporation and precipitation throughout the year. The combination of elevated temperatures and abundant moisture creates a highly productive environment for biomass growth, as mentioned in your background information. As a result, tropical forests like the ones in Laos can produce as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year. On the other hand, Ireland's forests are located in a temperate zone, which experiences a more varied climate with milder temperatures and changing weather patterns. While Ireland is known for its rainy and wet climate, the overall amount of rainfall is less than that found in tropical regions like Laos, due to the influence of the Atlantic Ocean, and its position outside of the tropical zone. The moderate temperatures, coupled with varying precipitation patterns, lead to a slower rate of biomass production in comparison to tropical forests. In conclusion, based on the climatic differences and geographical factors, the forests in Ireland would receive less rainfall compared to those in Laos. The tropical forest environment of Laos is typified by higher temperatures, increased insolation, and abundant rainfall, all of which contribute to a higher biomass productivity and distinctive soil characteristics as opposed to Ireland's temperate forests."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Eating too much fatty food, exercising too little and smoking can raise your future risk of heart disease. But there is another factor that can cause your heart problems more immediately: the air you breathe. Previous studies have linked high exposure  to environmental pollution to an increased risk of heart problem, but two analyses now show that poor air quality can lead to heart attack or stroke  within as little as a few hours after exposure. In one review of the research, scientists found that people exposed to high levels of pollutants  were up to 5% more likely to suffer a heart attack within days of exposure than those with lower exposure. A separate study of stroke patients showed that even air that the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers to be of \\"moderate\\"  quality and relatively safe for our health can raise the risk of stroke as much as 34% within 12 to 14 hours of exposure. The authors of both studies stress that these risks are relatively small for healthy people and certainly modest compared with other risk factors such as smoking and high blood pressure. However, it is important to be aware of these dangers because everyone is exposed to air pollution regardless of lifestyle choices. So stricter regulation by the EPA of pollutants may not only improve environmental air quality but could also become necessary to protect public health.

Additionally, by comparing the movie to other films, such as \\"Antwone Fisher\\" and \\"The Emperor's Club,\\" the reviewer seemingly expresses disappointment in its storytelling and execution. A more in-depth explanation of this negative opinion could potentially stem from a perceived lack of originality or an ineffective portrayal of heartwarming or uplifting themes. For example, the reviewer might find the movie's plot to be formulaic and unengaging, or they might think that the character development is lacking or unconvincing. Moreover, the comparison to other similar films suggests that the reviewer may have seen better examples of this genre that outshine the movie in question. In conclusion, this review expresses a negative opinion of the movie. The reviewer seems to be disappointed in the way the movie attempts to make the audience feel good, and their comparison to other feel-good films implies that they believe there are better alternatives available for audiences seeking an uplifting cinematic experience.

What is the first name of the subject whose identification with the cathedral itself is emphasized by her monumental stature?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Van Eyck gives Mary three roles: Mother of Christ, the personification of the \\"Ecclesia Triumphans\\" and Queen of Heaven, the latter apparent from her jewel-studded crown. The painting's near miniature size contrasts with Mary's unrealistically large stature compared with her setting. She physically dominates the cathedral; her head is almost level with the approximately sixty feet high gallery. This distortion of scale is found in a number of other van Eyck's Madonna paintings, where the arches of the mostly gothic interior do not allow headroom for the virgin. Pächt describes the interior as a \\"throne room\\", which envelopes her as if a \\"carrying case\\". Her monumental stature reflects a tradition reaching back to an Italo-Byzantine type – perhaps best known through Giotto's Ognissanti Madonna (c. 1310) – and emphasises her identification with the cathedral itself. Till-Holger Borchert says that van Eyck did not paint her as \\"the Madonna in a church\\", but instead as metaphor, presenting Mary \\"as the Church\\". This idea that her size represents her embodiment as the church was first suggested by Erwin Panofsky in 1941. Art historians in the 19th century, who thought the work was executed early in van Eyck's career, attributed her scale as the mistake of a relatively immature painter.The composition is today seen as deliberate, and opposite to both his Madonna of Chancellor Rolin and Arnolfini Portrait. These works show interiors seemingly too small to contain the figures, a device van Eyck used to create and emphasise an intimate space shared by donor and saint. The Virgin's height recalls his Annunciation of 1434–36, although in that composition there are no architectural fittings to give a clear scale to the building. Perhaps reflecting the view of a \\"relatively immature painter\\", a copy of the Annunciation by Joos van Cleve shows Mary at a more realistic proportion scale to her surroundings.Mary is presented as a Marian apparition; in this case she probably appears before a donor, who would have been kneeling...

If a student has a fever are they healthy or do they have a virus or infection?  Stephanie is a nurse at the local high school. Recently, the flu has been going around and she has had many students come into her office feeling ill. When a student comes in, the first thing she does is check their temperature to test for a fever.  Hint: White blood cells also make chemicals that cause a fever. A fever is a higher-than-normal body temperature. Normal human body temperature is 98.6°F (37°C). Most bacteria and viruses that infect people reproduce fastest at this temperature. When the temperature is higher, the pathogens cannot reproduce as fast, so the body raises the temperature to kill them. A fever also causes the immune system to make more white blood cells. In these ways, a fever helps the body fight infection. A:","output":"Based on the paragraph, if a student has a fever, it's more likely that they have a virus or infection.

By Daily Mail Reporter PUBLISHED: 11:41 EST, 30 October 2012 | UPDATED: 11:59 EST, 30 October 2012 All Australian children will learn an Asian language after Prime Minister Julia Gillard launched a visionary plan to help the country exploit the region's 'unstoppable' economic growth. In a move to ensure Australia are prepared for the 'Asian Century', Ms Gillard wants to improve links with the continent by committing to 25 ambitious goals over the next 13 years. All schoolchildren in the country will choose one of four ‘priority’ languages to learn at school – Indonesian, Japanese, Hindi and Chinese. Ambitious: Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard hopes that her plan to encourage all schoolchildren to speak an Asian language will improve financial links with the region Ms Gillard is not intending to lower wages to compete with the","output":"region, but rather aims to strengthen Australia's economy through education and increased collaboration on trade, investment, and research. The initiative, called \\"Australia in the Asian Century,\\" underscores the importance of the Asian market for the nation's future prosperity.  The Australian government will invest heavily in education and language training programs, as well as collaborate with businesses and academic institutions to integrate Asian studies and collaborations within their curricula. In addition to promoting language skills, the Australian government is keen on fostering a deeper understanding of Asian cultures, political systems, and economies. To achieve these goals, the government will work closely with state education departments to ensure that schools have adequate funding and resources to implement these language courses. Teacher training programs will be tailored to include specialized instruction in the four priority languages, and partnerships with universities in Asian countries will be established to provide study-abroad opportunities for students and joint research projects for academics. To facilitate an innovative and skilled workforce, the plan includes provisions to increase university and research collaboration between Australian universities and their Asian counterparts, expand exchange programs, and offer internship opportunities in the region for Australian students. In addition to the educational initiatives, the Australian government will focus on forging stronger political and economic relationships with its Asian neighbors. This will involve high-level diplomatic engagements, improving trade relations, and building partnerships in areas such as infrastructure development, energy, and climate change. The ultimate goal is to position Australia as a key player in the Asian region, both economically and diplomatically. Addressing the potential concerns of existing Australian industries that may face challenges in adapting to the changing economic landscape, Ms. Gillard emphasizes the importance of maintaining an inclusive and supportive environment for all citizens. She acknowledges the need to invest in other sectors of the economy, such as manufacturing, agriculture, and healthcare services, to ensure that job opportunities are not entirely reliant on the Asian market. The \\"Australia in the Asian Century\\" plan has received mixed reactions from various sectors. Critics argue that it may place undue pressure on schools and teachers to implement the ambitious language initiatives, while proponents assert that the investment in education and training is essential for Australia's long-term economic security. In conclusion, Prime Minister Julia Gillard's visionary plan to have all Australian children learn an Asian language is aimed at ensuring the country is well-positioned to capitalize on the projected economic growth in Asia over the coming years. By establishing strong links in education, trade, and diplomacy, Australia seeks to become an influential player in the region and secure its economic future for generations to come. However, the successful implementation of this plan will depend on the government's ability to address the challenges and garner the necessary support from both the public and private sectors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's a detailed and long answer to your question: French is a Romance language that evolved from Vulgar Latin and Gallo-Romance languages. It is the official language in 29 countries, including France, Belgium, Switzerland, and Canada. It is also one of the six official languages used in the United Nations. The French language is spoken by approximately 274 million people worldwide, making it the fifth most spoken language globally. France has a rich literary history, with renowned authors like Victor Hugo, Marcel Proust, and Gustave Flaubert contributing to its prestige. French uses the Latin alphabet, which consists of 26 letters. It also has a system of accent marks that can be used to distinguish between different grammatical functions or pronunciation of words, such as acute (é), grave (è), circumflex (â, ê, î, ô, û), and diaeresis (ë, ï, ü). Grammar-wise, French features a complex system of conjugation, with verbs being conjugated according to tense, mood, and subject. It also has two primary grammatical genders: masculine and feminine. Additionally, there are several pronoun forms and common contractions used in everyday conversation and writing. Influence and mutual borrowing between English and French have been significant over the centuries due to historical and political connections. Many English words have their roots in French, and vice versa. The Norman Conquest of England in 1066 cemented the influence of French in England, resulting in the incorporation of numerous French words and phrases in the English language. Today, French remains an important language in the worlds of international diplomacy, business, and culture.

Their names were Christie, who was the governor, and two senators named Bob and Cory. They were all important grown-ups who made decisions to help the people living in their land. But, they didn't always agree on everything, and sometimes, they didn't get along very well. You see, when people don't get along, it's like when you have a toy that you don't want to share with your little brother or sister. It can cause some arguments and make everyone feel unhappy. That's how it was for Christie, Bob, and Cory. Sometimes, Christie would say or do things that Bob and Cory didn't like. They would think, \\"Oh, Christie, that's not a good idea at all!\\" But they didn't have the magic power to change Christie's mind. And Christie would feel the same way about Bob and Cory. He'd think, \\"Bob and Cory, you two just don't understand!\\" When people who make big decisions don't get along, it can cause problems. The people who live in the land might start to feel confused or worried about what will happen next. So, it's very important for the leaders to try to understand each other and work together. Even though Christie, Bob, and Cory didn't always like each other, they still worked hard every day to help the people living in New Jersey. They made choices about schools, roads, and other things that everyone needs. Sometimes, they even found ways to work together and get things done! And when they did, it was like everyone in the land went to a big, fun picnic and enjoyed playing together. The story of Christie, Bob, and Cory teaches us that it's okay to have different opinions, but it's also important to work together, especially when we're taking care of others.

It was unusual for people to travel by air because it was expensive and dangerous. In those days, there were no flight attendants to look after the passengers. Young men ,or \\"stewards\\" helped the passengers onto the airplane and carried the passengers' luggage but they did not provide food and drinks. _  Ellen Church was born in 1904 on a farm in Iowa. She was a different child. She didn't want to work on a farm or marry a farmer --she wanted a more adventurous life. Ellen studied to be a nurse at the University of Minnesota and then got a job in a hospital. For the next few years she stayed at the hospital but also took flying lessons and got her pilot's license. Ellen was twenty-five years old when she first got in touch with Boeing Air Transport. She loved flying but she understood that airlines were a man's world. Although women like Emelia Earheart were becoming famous, she realized it was impossible for a woman to have a career as a pilot .But she had another idea. Most people were frightened of flying because. flying was still an unreliable  way to travel. There were often delays ,many crashes and the bad weathers made many passengers sick. Ellen thought nurses could take care of passengers during flights and B.A.T. agreed. The young woman from Iowa and seven other nurses became the first air stewardesses. At first pilots were unhappy because they did not want stewardesses on airplanes, but passengers loved the stewardesses. In 1940 there were around 1000 of them working for different airlines. The early \\"stewardesses\\" had to be under twenty-five-year-old, single and slim. When a woman joined an airline, she had to promise not to get married or have children. It was hard job and not well paid. They worked long hours and earned 1 an hour. In the 1970s, stewardesses were unhappy in their job and airlines had to make some changes. Since the 1970s, \\"stewardesses\\" have been called flight attendants. They are well paid and work fewer hours than in the past.

Brand Philip draws attention to the similarities of the panels' linear construction, especially the manner in which the folds and lines of their clothing form triangular shapes. The train of Barbara's headdress across her chest corresponds with the opening of Albrecht's fur-lined coat. It was more usual in pendant portraits of this type for the male to be on the left-hand side; the positioning here may be an indication that Dürer originally intended his father's panel to stand alone, given that Barbara's was painted some time later.Albrecht the Elder's panel is regarded as the superior of the two works. This may in part be attributed to differing contemporary treatments of male and female portraits; men were allowed more individuality, while female portraits were bound by stereotypes and were not as daring, for example showing evidence of ageing. In either case, the father painting is far more closely detailed, especially in the lining of clothing, which is summary in Barbara's panel, compared to the long seam of her husband's gown. This contrast in detail can also be seen in the treatment of the rosaries, which are given prominence and a glowing red colour in his panel, but are small and relegated in hers.Albrecht the Elder's panel is usually, but not always, thought to..., can you guess it ?

The following article contains an answer for the question: What show's history was the performance of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" listed as the third greatest in? , can you please find it?   \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" was first performed live on April 17, 1991 at the OK Hotel in Seattle, Washington. The performance is featured on the DVD of the 2004 box set With the Lights Out, while shorter clips are included on the Nevermind Classic Albums DVD, as well as the documentary film Hype! As the song's lyrics had not yet been entirely written, there are notable differences between it and the final version. For example, the first performance started with \\"Come out and play, make up the rules\\" instead of the eventual opening of \\"Load up on guns, bring your friends\\". A recording of the earlier version appears on With the Lights Out and again on Sliver: The Best of the Box. A similar early live performance of the song is found in the documentary 1991: The Year Punk Broke, filmed during a 1991 summer tour in Europe with Sonic Youth. Nirvana often altered the song's lyrics and tempo for live performances. Some live performances of the song had the line \\"our little group has always been\\" changed to \\"our little tribe has always been\\", which can be heard on the 1996 live album From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah. Rolling Stone remarked that the Wishkah version of \\"Teen Spirit\\" \\"[found] Cobain's guitar reeling outside the song's melodic boundaries and sparking new life in that nearly played-out hit\\". A notable alternate performance of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" occurred on BBC's Top of the Pops in 1991, during which the band refused to mime to the pre-recorded backing track and Cobain sang in a deliberately low voice and altered numerous lyrics in the song (for example, \\"Load up on guns, bring your friends\\" became \\"Load up on drugs, kill your friends\\").   Cobain later said he was trying to sound like former Smiths frontman Morrissey. When Top of the Pops was cancelled in 2006, The Observer listed Nirvana's performance of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" as the third greatest in the show's history. This performance can be found on the 1994 home video Live! Tonight! Sold Out!!.

According to the results of a new survey, the lessons of the Great Recession certainly haven't resulted in any increased financial literacy. Despite growing numbers of Americans giving themselves a \\"very high\\" rating on their financial know-how, fewer of them grasp financial basics. The long-running study by the Finra Investment Education Foundation includes six questions intentionally designed to be very easy. They asked things like calculating whether an account earning 2 percent on 100 would be worth more than 102 after five years, or whether 15-year or 30-year mortgages had higher monthly payments but lower overall interest payments. Five of the six questions have been on the test for several years. In 2015, only 37 percent got four out of the five questions right, versus 42 percent in 2009. The question that really stumped people, though, was, \\"If interest rates rise, what will typically happen to bond prices?

The Soviets are secretly constructing a bridge at night over a river. To avoid detection, it is being built underwater, just below the surface. In an attempt to find out where the Germans plan to strike, Colonel Semenov (George Macready) has a small paratrooper unit dropped behind enemy lines to attack a divisional headquarters and hopefully take an officer prisoner for interrogation. The local partisans, led by the wily Kostyuk (Roman Bohnen), provide a guide, Lisa Elenko (Marguerite Chapman). The attack succeeds at first. Alexei Kulkov (Paul Muni), one of the paratroopers, takes seven Germans prisoner in the basement. Then, just as Elenko brings him a message, German artillery hits the building, causing it to collapse and trap them in the spacious cellar. Afterward, Kulkov's dog sniffs out where his master is buried and starts digging. This alerts one of Kulkov's comrades, who communicates with him by tapping on a metal pipe in code. Learning that Kulkov has caught an officer, he leaves to get help. Kulkov is in no hurry to dig out. Though the prisoners rank no higher than a sergeant, he is convinced one of them is an officer in disguise, based on a pistol and a monocle he has found. He begins questioning the men one by one, but while he rules out ex-miner Stillman (Rudolph Anders) and a former magician (Philip Van Zandt), he cannot pinpoint his man. An eighth German soldier, thought to be dead, wakes up and attacks. In the struggle, the lone lantern is extinguished and Elenko is stabbed in the shoulder.

Foster Answer:","output":"Title: The Haunting of Blackwood Castle Genre: Horror, Mystery, Drama Plot: In a small, remote English village, a young man named Foster works as an ordinary bartender. The village is home to many whispered legends surrounding the enigmatic Lord Blackwood and his ominous castle. Some say Lord Blackwood has a dark, insatiable hunger for supernatural power, while others claim he's merely a troubled recluse. Foster is a determined individual with dreams that extend far beyond the confines of his small, claustrophobic village. He longs to gather enough money to leave and explore the world. One fateful day, he meets an enigmatic man who enters the bar and ultimately reveals himself as Lord Blackwood. Lord Blackwood proposes a bet to Foster: if Foster can spend an entire night in Blackwood Castle on All Soul's Eve—the night when the veil between the living and dead is said to be at its thinnest—he will be awarded with a significant sum of money. Enticed by the notion of being free from his financial constraints, Foster reluctantly accepts the bet. The night arrives and Foster hesitantly enters the castle, accompanied by his trusty lantern. As the hours pass, he starts to experience inexplicable, bizarre phenomena: distant whispers, chilling drafts, and strange, unsettling visions. As Foster's uneasiness grows, his determination to withstand the strange occurrences is tested to the limit. Midnight strikes, and Foster uncovers a secret chamber that holds diaries and manuscripts belonging to Lord Blackwood. The writings outline disturbing rituals, ancient prophecies, and reveal the dark truth behind the hauntings: the countless souls trapped and tormented by Lord Blackwood to fuel his quest for supernatural power. Desperate not only for his prize, but also to prevent further suffering, Foster searches for a way to free the tortured spirits. In a thrilling, action-packed climax, Foster discovers that breaking the curse requires him to confront Lord Blackwood and destroy an ancient artifact that binds the souls to the castle. As daylight rises, Foster overcomes his fears, challenges Lord Blackwood, and successfully shatters the artifact. The trapped spirits are able to find eternal rest while the once-powerful Blackwood is left frail and powerless. Foster collects his winnings and, in the aftermath of his harrowing experience, decides to donate a portion to the village that had been suffering under the weight of Lord Blackwood's sinister presence. Now left with enough money to embark on his own personal journey of self-discovery, Foster leaves the village with an even greater sense of purpose and the gratitude of its inhabitants. \\"The Haunting of Blackwood Castle\\" explores themes of courage, integrity, and self-discovery, reminding the audience of the importance of facing one's own fears and the power of selflessness in the face of adversity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Annie liked all foods, whether they were organic or not.  Which friend drank less milk from cows treated with antibiotics?  Hint: As for the public health or food safety concern, organic foods are intended to be healthy, free of contaminations and free from agents that could cause human diseases. Organic milk is meant to have no chemical residues to consumers, and the restrictions on the use of antibiotics and chemicals in organic food production has the purpose to accomplish this goal. Although dairy cows in both organic and conventional farming practices can be exposed to pathogens, it has been shown that, because antibiotics are not permitted as a preventative measure in organic practices, there are far fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens on organic farms. This dramatically increases the efficacy of antibiotics when/if they are necessary.

Answer: more","output":"Explanation: In electrical circuits, a wire is used to conduct or carry electrical current from one point to another. The ability of a wire to carry current depends upon its cross-sectional area (thickness) and the material it is made of. A large or thicker wire has a larger cross-sectional area compared to a thin wire. A wire with a larger cross-sectional area offers less resistance to the flow of electrical current, allowing more current to pass through it. On the other hand, a thin wire has a smaller cross-sectional area and offers more resistance to the flow of current, resulting in less current passing through it.

Do you put BB cream before or after foundation? To address this question, we need to consider the purpose and formulation of each product: BB cream (short for \\"beauty balm\\" or \\"blemish balm\\") is a multipurpose cream with light coverage that combines several skincare and makeup benefits, such as moisturizing, sun protection, and evening out skin tone. It tends to be lighter than a foundation.  Foundation is a makeup product designed to provide more coverage to even out skin tone and conceal imperfections. It comes in various finishes and levels of coverage. Based on their purposes, it would be more common to use either BB cream or foundation rather than layering them. However, if you want to layer them, then apply BB cream first to provide the skincare benefits and light coverage, and follow it up with a light layer of foundation if you need additional coverage. 2. Which is better; foundation or BB cream? Determining which is better depends on your personal needs and preferences.  If you prefer lighter coverage, a natural finish, and a product that offers skincare benefits, then BB cream might be a better choice for you.

Cubs legend Ernie Banks' will and body caught in family feud FILE 2014: Chicago Cubs Hall of Fame slugger Ernie Banks smiles after an interview at the Cubs offices in Chicago. (AP) Beloved Chicago Cub Ernie Banks made fans smile during and long after his Hall of Fame career, but since his death last month at 83, there's been nothing but fighting going on between his estranged wife, twin sons and caregiver over everything from his body to his estate. The first battle came when estranged wife Elizabeth Banks went to court to prevent Regina Rice, who cared for Banks in his later years, from having Banks' remains cremated. Even though the baseball legend once told a reporter that he wanted his ashes scattered at Wrigley, Elizabeth Banks said he was joking. Whether her effort to keep his remains intact while a court sorts that case out isn't clear, because no one seems to know where the body is. Officials at Graceland Cemetery, just blocks from Wrigley Field, say he wasn't buried there. The funeral home that handled the Banks memorial says it doesn't have his body. And now, twins Jerry and Joey Banks are getting their turn at bat, challenging Rice over a power of attorney, a health care directive and a will giving everything to her. \\"I find it quite interesting that she did not tell anyone that she had an attorney write up a new will,\\" Jerry Banks said. Joey Banks said the family thought Rice was helping and watching over \\"Mr. Cub\\" while he was in Chicago, the city where he became a legend. Banks is remembered as much for his boundless enthusiasm despite playing on mostly losing teams as his 512 home runs and two MVP awards. Family attorney Mark Bogen said that only after the funeral did the Banks family become aware he had signed a new will during his illness. A provision of the will, signed and dated Oct. 17, says: \\"I am making no provisions under this will for wife or my children, not for a lack of love and affection for them and for reasons best known to them.\\" Bogen said the family will vigorously fight the will. \\"It is understandable that Ernie's family is concerned at this very sad time,\\" Rice said in her statement. \\"However, the record, and those closest to Ernie, will dispel any iota of concern regarding my relationship with Ernie and his trust in me to carry out his wishes.\\" Before Banks' death, family members frequently spoke to Rice because she made it difficult for them to speak directly to him, Jerry Banks said. \\"At the funeral of my father, I went out of my way to praise Ms. Rice and her son for helping my father,\\" Joey Banks said. \\"What I did not know at that time is that for at least six months prior to my father's death, in my opinion, she was using him, manipulating him and controlled him.\\" One social media post by Rice drew criticism from Jerry Banks. The post, which was published eight days after his father died, showed a waiter presenting a bottle of Champagne with the caption: \\"Spa time. Yay.\\" Jerry Banks said, \\"Everybody's in mourning. If you're supposed to be the caregiver, long-time associate…why are you up in the spa?\\" Rice went on to say she will not participate in any verbal jousting with Banks' family or do anything to tarnish his legacy. The Associated Press contributed to this report. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The article discusses the ongoing family feud surrounding the will and body of the late Chicago Cubs legend, Ernie Banks, who passed away in 2014 at the age of 83.

So, let's pretend that a country is like a big family with lots of people. The person in charge of this big family is like the parent - this would be similar to the White House or the President in the United States. Just like how mom and dad make rules to help us, the White House also makes plans to help everyone in the 'family'. The White House has come up with a bunch of ideas - just like your chore list - to help people in the middle of the 'family.' They are calling it the Middle Class Task Force recommendations.  One of these ideas is to help students, maybe like your big brother or sister when they go to college. They have to take money from a bank to pay for their education which is called a loan. But, sometimes, it's so much money they can't pay it back. So, the White House has decided to make a rule, which will make sure they don't have to pay back too much. Another idea is to make something called workplace IRAs automatic. Let's pretend IRAs are like piggy banks where adults put money for when they are old and don't work anymore - like grandma and grandpa. This new rule means every workplace has to have a big piggy bank for all the workers, and they automatically put a little bit of their paycheck in the piggy bank. They also want to have rules to protect these piggy banks, so the money is safe and people can't steal it. Isn't that nice that they care so much? The White House also wants to talk about helping grandma and grandpa, and others who are older too. It's like they want to make sure they are comfortable, have good food, and get their medicines.  So, in short, the White House is trying to make everyone in the 'family' happier and more comfortable by bringing these new rules or ideas, like helping students pay back their loans or making savings safer for everyone. Just like how our family supports each other, they want to support all the people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write the next sentence. Robert thought Randy was a player, because","output":"Robert thought Randy was a player, because he had always witnessed how effortlessly Randy could charm people, both men and women alike, with his charismatic personality, disarming sense of humor and undeniable physical attractiveness. In all the time that Robert had known him – from their formative years spent as classmates in middle school, to the shared experiences they had pursuing their ambitions during their college years – he couldn't help but notice the changes that happened in Randy's social life. At first, it was a subtle shift; a growing number of acquaintances, an increasing popularity at social events and gatherings, and a seemingly endless string of romantic conquests in which he appeared to be in total control. Over the years, however, this slow transformation morphed into something far more significant, and Randy's reputation as a player became the stuff of legend. It was clear that Randy had honed his skills as a master communicator, able to navigate the complex world of human relationships with an ease and dexterity that was almost disconcerting. He seemed to have an innate ability to make connections with others on a deep, emotional level, building trust and confidence quickly and establishing the basis for long-lasting friendships. This magnetic quality also extended to his romantic life, where his natural charm and smooth-talking abilities seemed to hold an irresistible allure for those who found themselves drawn into his orbit. It wasn't uncommon for Robert to see Randy's name pop up in conversations on social media, or to hear stories from mutual friends about his latest romantic escapades. There was, however, a darker side to Randy's reputation. His apparent commitment-phobia and nonchalant attitude towards the feelings of others earned him a fair amount of criticism from those who cared about the people he had left in his wake. It seemed as though Randy was always chasing the thrill of new experiences, constantly seeking the excitement of pursuing something fresh and unattainable, never sticking around long enough to develop any genuine sense of emotional attachment. For Robert, his concern about Randy's well-being stemmed, in part, from memories of their shared past. There was a time when they had been close enough to confide in one another about their insecurities, their hopes and fears, and their dreams for the future. Robert remembered a younger, more vulnerable Randy, who had struggled to find his own identity and who had, at times, been plagued by self-doubt. It was difficult for him to reconcile this image of his friend with the person Randy had become – a seemingly invincible figure, who was adored and admired by so many, yet who also appeared to be increasingly alone in his quest for validation and acceptance. Ultimately, Robert's belief that Randy was a player was based on a myriad of factors – from the observable evidence of his friend's social prowess, to his own knowledge of Randy's personal history and the assumptions he had made about his motivations. In the end, though, perhaps the most telling reason for this conviction was a lingering sense of sadness that Robert felt when he thought about the person his friend had become – a sadness born from the realization that, in spite of all his apparent success in the world of romance and relationships, Randy might never truly know the happiness and fulfillment that comes from finding a deeper, more meaningful connection with another person."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"Yes, \\"Systems of 'degrees' and 'removals' are used in the English-speaking world to describe the exact relationship between two cousins (in the broad sense) and the ancestor they have in common\\" is a reasonable answer. To provide more detail: The terms \\"2nd cousin\\" and \\"3rd cousin\\" refer to degrees, and \\"once removed\\" refers to removals. Let's break down these terms to help you understand the concept better. Degrees: Cousins with the same degree share the same great-grandparent(s) or great-great-grandparent(s), etc. The degree represents the number of generations between the cousins and these common ancestors. - 1st cousins share the same grandparents - 2nd cousins share the same great-grandparents - 3rd cousins share the same great-great-grandparents, and so on. Removals: The term \\"removed\\" refers to the difference in generations between two cousins. When cousins are from the same generation, they are called \\"first cousins\\" or simply \\"cousins\\" with no removals. When there is a one-generation gap between the cousins, they are \\"once removed,\\" a two-generation gap makes them \\"twice removed,\\" and so on. For example, if person A is your 2nd cousin, and person B is the child of person A, then person B is your 2nd cousin once removed because there is a one-generation difference between you and person B. Similarly, a 3rd cousin once removed would be one generation removed from you in either direction. If person C is your 3rd cousin and has a child (person D), then person D is your 3rd cousin once removed.

Many things happen because something caused or influenced them to happen. Sometimes it is hard to look at a cause and find out what caused or influenced them to happen. Sometimes it is hard to look at a cause and find out what causes the effect. It may help you to start with the effect and use your reasoning  skills. Think about all the things you know that could be reasons for the effect you can see. For example, you may see someone putting on a heavy jacket. This is the effect. To look for a cause, think to yourself, \\"What would take someone put on a heavy jacket?\\" Maybe the person is going outside into very cold weather. Maybe the person works in the penguin pen  at Sea World. Maybe the person is going to visit an ice skating rink where the air is kept very cold. All of these things could be a cause for putting on a heavy jacket. Now, think about a second example. The effect is a boy named Abi has to go to the head teacher's office.

It dropped to a much lower level in September, October and November, when they released a significant portion of the water as a yearly chore.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   When was the water level lower, in March or in May?  Hint: The water level is seasonal, being lowered by about 10 feet (3.0 m) over the winter. The reservoir fills in the spring from snow melt and underground springs. The lake is usually at full level by late spring, but in the occasional years of low snow melt and low rainfall, it may remain up to several feet below its typical level. Water is let out of the lake in the fall so that ice will not damage docks and other structures around the lake. This also leads to excellent water quality, as a significant portion of the water is replaced every year. Answer:","output":"The water level was lower in March. According to the information provided, the water level in Large Lake was high in March, 3 feet higher in April, and 7 feet higher still in May. This means that the water level increased from March to May.

Article: Men and women are still treated unequally in the workplace. Women continue to earn less, on average, for the same performance. Research has shown that both conscious  and subconscious biases   contribute to this problem. But we've discovered another source of inequality: Women often don't get what they want and deserve because they don't ask for it. In three separate studies, we found that men are more likely than women to negotiate for what they want. The first study found that the starting salaries of male MBAs who had recently graduated from Carnegie Mellon were 7.6%, or almost 4,000, higher on average than those of female MBAs from the same program. That's because most of the women had simply accepted the employer's salary offer; in fact, only 7% had attempted to negotiate. But 57% of their male counterparts--or eight times as many men as women--had asked for more. Another study tested this gender difference in the lab. Subjects were told that they would be observed playing a word game and that they would be paid between 3 and 10 for playing. After each subject completed the task, an experimenter thanked the participant and said, \\"Here's 3. Is 3 OK?\\" For the men, it was not OK, and they said so. Their requests for more money are nine times as many as the women's. The largest of the three studies surveyed several hundred people over the Internet, asking them about the most recent negotiations they'd attempted or started and when they expected to negotiate next. The study showed that men place themselves in negotiation situations much more often than women do. There are several reasons accounting for the phenomenon. First, women often are taught from an early age not to promote their own interests and to focus instead on the needs of others. The messages girls receive--from parents, teachers, other children, the media, and society in general--can be so powerful that when they grow up they may not realize that they've made this behavior part of them, or they may realize it but not understand how it... Question: Which of the following statements is NOT true? Options: A: Women are more likely to accept the employer's salary offer. B: Men tend to ask for more money than woman.

The given French sentence translates to English as stated above. The sentence indicates that an establishment or service typically remains closed on public holidays. However, an exception is made on July 1st, implying that it remains open or accessible to the public on that day. Public holidays, also known as bank holidays or national holidays, are days when businesses and workplaces observe a day off in recognition of a cultural, historical, or religious event. Examples of public holidays include Christmas Day, New Year's Day, and Independence Day. In some countries, such as Canada, July 1st is a significant public holiday because it represents Canada Day, which commemorates the anniversary of the confederation of the country. On this day, Canadians celebrate their national pride and history through various events, parades, and fireworks. Similarly, other countries have special days that are recognized as public holidays and serve as opportunities for citizens to celebrate their nation's heritage. In the United States, the 4th of July is observed as Independence Day, while in France, Bastille Day falls on July 14th. These holidays represent vital milestones in their respective national histories and, as a result, are celebrated with great enthusiasm and patriotism. Businesses, especially those in the service industry or those which cater to the public, often adjust their opening hours or days off depending on the significance of the public holidays. In the case presented, the establishment chooses to stay open on July 1st, despite acknowledging it as a public holiday.

Summarize this article: In January, as the date of Christopher Sepulvado’s execution approached, the Louisiana Department of Corrections did not have the drugs it needed to carry out his death sentence.      So the state turned to a supplier that uses hydromorphone to relieve patients’ suffering, not to kill them: Lake Charles Memorial Hospital.      “We assumed the drug was for one of their patients, so we sent it. We did not realize what the focus was,” said Ulysses Gene Thibodeaux, a board member for the private, nonprofit hospital and chief judge of the Third Circuit Court of Appeal.      “Had we known of the real use,” he said, “we never would have done it.”      The Department of Corrections bought 20 vials of the drug on Jan. 28, a week before Sepulvado’s scheduled execution, according to a document provided by the state in a lawsuit challenging its lethal-injection practice.      Until now, the source of those vials has not been publicly known.      Thibodeaux said it’s routine for hospital pharmacies to supply drugs to other pharmacies, including those run by the state, for their patients.      “We never inquire into the purpose for it. We assume it’s for legitimate and noble purposes,” Thibodeaux said. “We have assurances from our CEO, who is a very forthright guy, that this will not happen again.”      State officials with the Louisiana Department of Corrections did not respond to repeated requests to comment for this story. Sepulvado’s lawyers declined to comment.      Sepulvado wasn’t executed on Feb. 5. After a botched execution in Oklahoma, the state agreed to delay his execution for six months as it considered alternative methods. A status conference on his lawsuit has been set for November.      Drugs expired as execution was delayed      Sepulvado was convicted in 1993 for killing his six-year-old stepson by beating him with a screwdriver and submerging his body in scalding water. Over the years, his attorneys have delayed his execution by arguing that the state’s death penalty practices could violate his constitutional protection against cruel and unusual punishment.      This is part of a continuing investigation into Louisiana’s execution methods.      Highlights of our coverage:      Louisiana’s death-penalty protocol uses same drugs as lengthy Arizona execution      State failed to turn over key public records about execution drugs      State has explored illegally obtaining drug for upcoming execution      With lethal-injection drugs hard to get, states turning to custom pharmacies      State’s supply of drug for executing prisoners has expired, says attorney for death-row inmate      After several delays, his execution was rescheduled for early February. Three weeks before the state was supposed to carry out his death sentence, it didn’t have the drug it needed. Its supply of pentobarbital had expired in September.      Throughout the fall, the state had scrambled to procure lethal injection drugs. Other states were having trouble finding them, too, after drug manufacturers refused to sell to prisons and current supplies started to expire.      At one point, the Louisiana Department of Corrections considered ordering pentobarbital from an Oklahoma compounding pharmacy — which would have been illegal because the pharmacy wasn’t licensed in Louisiana.      Then, nine days before Sepulvado’s Feb. 5 execution date, the state announced it had approved another method to put him to death. The new combination was hydromorphone and midazolam, the same drugs that had just been used in the prolonged execution of Ohio inmate Dennis McGuire.      Drug obtained days before scheduled execution      There was one problem with the alternate method: The state Department of Corrections apparently didn’t have hydromorphone, either. However, it did have midazolam, a sedative commonly in stock at pharmacies.      A few days later — five days before the execution — Department of Corrections spokeswoman Pam Laborde said the agency had the two drugs it needed to kill Sepulvado.      The department wouldn’t say where they came from. A federal judge ordered it to reveal the supplier to Sepulvado’s lawyers, but the department requested the information remain under seal.      Now, two people — Thibodeaux and a source that refused to be identified — say the state got its hydromorphone from Lake Charles Memorial Hospital. The Lens also reviewed a document that confirmed the source of the drug.      According to documents shared with Sepulvado’s lawyers, the drugs were sent to Elayn Hunt Correctional Center’s Medical Unit, which the state describes the site as a “medical facility for seriously or chronically ill offenders.”      Properly permitted hospital pharmacies like the one at Lake Charles Memorial can legally supply medications to other pharmacies, as long as the drugs are for a hospital patient, according to Malcolm Broussard, executive director of the Louisiana Board of Pharmacy.      The supplying pharmacy wouldn’t need a prescription for that particular patient. Those rules apply even to highly regulated drugs such as hydromorphone, he said.      Broussard said he didn’t know enough about this particular transaction to comment on it.      Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, said he wasn’t aware of a hospital supplying a lethal-injection drug. But it isn’t surprising, he said, because hydromorphone is “more commonly used and would be available … unlike some lethal injection drugs.”      Nationwide, drug suppliers concealed as drugs become hard to find      Around the country, states have moved to conceal the sources of their execution drugs.      Deborah Denno, a professor at the Fordham University School of Law and an expert on the death penalty, said states are becoming more secretive because the death penalty is becoming more controversial.      “The stakes are higher because the drug supplier is … more vulnerable,” Denno said, pointing to several lengthy executions this year in Ohio, Oklahoma and Arizona.      “They’re being secretive because they know they couldn’t carry out executions otherwise,” she said. “Look at the botches in 2014 alone.”      Louisiana’s tactics have changed in the past year and a half.      In 2013, the state identified the source of its execution drug, but refused to say when it expired.      State officials told The Lens repeatedly that there were no records showing the expiration date of its pentobarbital. Documents later made public showed that wasn’t true; the state apparently violated open records law by withholding the information.      Since then, the state has disclosed expiration dates but has argued that the source of the drugs is confidential. A state law says that the identities of people involved in executions cannot be publicized; the state Department of Corrections has argued that the law extends to drug manufacturers and suppliers.      That’s why the state redacted the supplier of the hydromorphone in documents shared with Sepulvado’s lawyers.      Oddly, however, the state didn’t redact the name of the pharmacist at Lake Charles Memorial who handled the order.      Should the hospital have known what the drug was for?      Denno said some states have resorted to unorthodox tactics as lethal injection drugs become harder to obtain. But she’s never heard of a state getting its drug from a hospital.      “There’s so much secrecy involved in all of this that it’s really hard to tell where the drugs are coming from,” Denno said.      She said Lake Charles Memorial Hospital should have known the state prison was looking for hydromorphone to carry out an execution.      If suppliers like the hospital don’t want to be involved in executions, she said, they could require a contract when selling drugs that could be used in the death penalty. That contract would specifically prohibit the drug’s use in executions.      That’s what drug manufacturers such as Hospira and Lundbeck have done, which sparked the shortage of lethal-injection drugs.      “It’s a slippery slope for a hospital to be the supplier,” Denno said. “They are enabling execution, no matter which way you slice it.” ||||| • Corrections department did not reveal drug’s intended use • ‘Had we known we never would have done it’ • Arizona inmate was injected 15 times      A Louisiana hospital unknowingly provided the state’s department of corrections with a drug used for lethal injections, it was revealed this week.      The Louisiana department of corrections purchased 20 vials of hydromorphone from Lake Charles Memorial hospital a week before the scheduled execution of Christopher Sepulvado, but did not inform the hospital of its intended use for the drug, according to a report by non-profit news group the Lens. The same report noted that the purchase was revealed in a document provided by the state in a lawsuit challenging its lethal-injection practice.      Sepulvado’s execution had been scheduled for 5 February, but was delayed and has not been rescheduled. Sepulvado was convicted of murdering his six-year-old stepson in 1993. Prosecutors said he beat the boy with a screwdriver before putting him in scalding water.      “We assumed the drug was for one of their patients, so we sent it. We did not realise what the focus was,” Ulysses Gene Thibodeaux, a board member for the private, non-profit hospital, told the Lens. Thibodeaux is also chief judge of the third circuit court of appeal but did not preside over the case linked to the execution drugs.            “Had we known of the real use we never would have done it.”      Medical experts said the request would not seem that unusual to the hospital, because hydromorphone is used to minimise patient suffering and hospital pharmacies frequently provide drugs to other pharmacies, including those in the prison system.      Louisiana was unable to obtain pentobarbital, a drug used in its usual cocktail for lethal injections. It then approved another method for executions using a combination of hydromorphone and midazolam.            States have found it increasingly difficult to acquire lethal injection drugs since manufacturers, mostly based in Europe, began to withdraw supplies because of their opposition to capital punishment.      The mixture of hydromorphone and midazolam was first used in January in Ohio’s execution of Dennis McGuire, which lasted nearly 30 minutes. Eyewitnesses said McGuire gasped for breath for at least 10 minutes while making attempts to sit up on the gurney.      It was also used in April in Oklahoma’s botched execution of Clayton Lockett, which lasted about 43 minutes. The White House said that execution “fell short of humane standards”.      Last month the mixture was used in Arizona, in the execution of Joseph Wood, who according to a court filing was seen to be “gasping and snorting” after he was injected. It subsequently emerged that Wood had been injected 15 times during the nearly two hours it took him to die.      The attorney general, Eric Holder, subsequently said he was “greatly troubled” by the spate of botched executions.      Information about how the Louisiana department of corrections obtained hydromorphone is sealed but, along with Thibodeaux’s claims, the Lens saw a document confirming the source of the drug. |||||","output":"In January, Christopher Sepulvado was scheduled for execution in Louisiana, but the Corrections Department realized they didn't have the required drugs to carry out the death sentence. The state turned to Lake Charles Memorial Hospital, a supplier used for relieving patients' suffering, not for lethal purposes. The hospital, under the assumption that the drug was for a patient, forwarded it to the Department, unaware of its intended use.  The Department of Corrections bought 20 vials of hydromorphone, a drug commonly used for pain relief, a week before Sepulvado’s scheduled execution. This information was shared with the public when a document given by the state during a lawsuit challenging its lethal-injection practice surfaced.  The hospital board member, Ulysses Gene Thibodeaux, mentioned that supplying drugs to other pharmacies, including state-run ones, is routine. However, the hospital was not informed about how the Corrections Department planned to use the drug. Thibodeaux assured that such a situation would not arise again under the aegis of the hospital's CEO. Sepulvado's execution, originally planned for February 5, was put on hold due to a flawed execution in Oklahoma. The state agreed to postpone Sepulvado's execution while considering alternative execution methods. Sepulvado was serving time for the crime of torturing and murdering his six-year-old stepson in 1993. His execution had been deferred multiple times by his lawyers, who argued that the state's death penalty practices could potentially infringe upon his constitutional protection against brutal and unusual punishment. In desperation, due to the expired supply of their regular death penalty drug, pentobarbital, in September, the Corrections Department considered obtaining the drug illegally from an Oklahoma pharmacy. However, they settled on a combination of hydromorphone and midazolam instead, the same combination used in the protracted execution of Ohio inmate Dennis McGuire. Sources confirm that the state acquired its hydromorphone from Lake Charles Memorial Hospital. Bordering on the illegal, this incident traces back to the difficulties facing states to secure lethal injection drugs, as numerous manufacturers refuse to sell to prisons due to moral, ethical, or legal reasons.  Across the US, steps are being taken to hide the sources of their execution drugs. This stems from the thriving controversies around the practice of the death penalty and the challenge of obtaining drugs, pushing states to be more furtive about the source, while maintaining transparency about expiry dates.  Experts point out that providers like Lake Charles Memorial Hospital could avoid involvement in such situations by establishing a contract when selling drugs that prohibits the drug’s usage for executions. The revelations around the Louisiana hospital supplying drugs for execution underscore the mounting challenges states face as they strive to maintain controversial death penalty practices."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Below are some of the reasons why it is inconsistent with the description given: 1. Age inconsistency: The text implies that Johnny is a young child. This is evident by phrases such as \\"his little friends\\" and birthday activities like \\"eating cake and ice cream\\" and \\"playing games\\". These details suggest a child's party, not one for someone turning 150 years old. 2. Uncommon age milestone: The age of 150 years old is extremely rare in human history. Only a handful of people have been documented to have lived up to or surpassed this age, so it would not be reasonable to assume Johnny turned 150 based on the information provided. 3. Presence of parents and friends of his age: The fact that Johnny's parents are mentioned in the description, and are able to organize a surprise birthday party for him, indicates that they are likely to be younger than Johnny. In addition, the mention of \\"little friends\\" implies that Johnny's friends are of a similar age to him, which would be very unusual if he were 150 years old. 4. Johnny receiving a new bike as a birthday gift: In the text, Johnny is given a new bike as a surprise birthday gift, which is a common gift for a child. This further reinforces the idea that Johnny is a young child, as a bike would be more appropriate for someone much younger than 150 years old.

But what is their most common response to seeing them again? It may seem strange, but most of the time they break down in tears. Now a group of psychologists from Yale University in the US say they have found the reason why, and that crying tears of joy may well be the body's way of restoring emotional balance. \\" _ seem to take place when people are unable to tolerate strong positive emotions, and people who do this seem to recover better from those strong emotions,\\" Oriana Aragon, the lead researcher, told The Telegraph. Aragon and her fellow psychologists looked at hundreds of participants' emotional responses to different things, including happy reunions and cute babies. Many participants said they would react in a negative or aggressive way to the positive things -- to cry at happy moments and want to pinch a cute baby's face or even tell them \\"I want to eat you up!\\" But then researchers found that these people were able to calm down from strong emotions more quickly. \\"We want a happy, middle spot. Extreme is not good. It's hard on our bodies,\\" Aragon told The Washington Post.

Given the question: From what movie was the song that the band who played Townsend's solo material live used as an intro at concerts in 2003 and 2004?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Strapping Young Lad was known for its energetic live performances, mostly owing to the eccentric appearance and persona of Devin Townsend. Adrian Begrand of PopMatters wrote \\"Nobody in metal today has the same kind of commanding stage presence as the self-professed Bald Bastard, Devin Townsend\\", and called Strapping Young Lad \\"one of the best live bands around\\". Townsend was famous for his on-stage antics; he integrated his ironic and tongue-in-cheek humor into live shows and interacted heavily with the audience. He would deliver comical, and often insulting remarks to them, organize circle pits, and parody heavy metal clichés as well as the genre itself.The band's humorous approach was also evidenced by a song frequently performed live from 1997, entitled \\"Far Beyond Metal\\", a parody of classic heavy metal. It became a live staple and a fan favorite, with lyrics changing practically every performance. Although it was recorded live on No Sleep 'till Bedtime, and on the For Those Aboot to Rock DVD, a studio version was not recorded until 2006 during The New Black sessions. The band was also sarcastic about their own Canadian heritage, they used \\"Blame Canada\\", a comedic anti-Canada song from South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut as intro music at many concerts in 2003 and 2004.For a period of time, Strapping Young Lad also played Townsend's solo material live. In 1998, after the release of Infinity, they began performing both Strapping Young Lad and Townsend's solo songs, as two separate sets. It was not until the 2003 release of Accelerated Evolution when Townsend formed a separate band, called The Devin Townsend Band, to act as his full-fledged solo band.

Julien disengages the handbrake of the bus without hesitation, and the bus full of children rolls down a hill. Their game has begun: the box changes its owner after each completed dare. Between the son of wealthy Belgian parents and the daughter of poor Polish immigrants a lasting friendship develops.

With various Bogdanoviches and Gazzaras scattered throughout cast and crew \\"They all laughed\\" is very much a family affair.If you add the fact that B.Gazzara and Miss A.Hepburn had a brief but passionate affair in an earlier picture it has the air of almost a private movie made for the enjoyment of the participants and that the entertainment of a wider audience merely an ancillary consideration.If this all smacks of smug \\"in - joke\\" self gratification you will be pleased to hear that Mr Bogdanovich sails well clear of that particular hazard and delivers a sweet and rather innocent \\"I love N.Y.\\" paean that is also an altar at which we can worship the ethereal beauty of the late Miss Hepburn. Make no mistake this is her picture.Mr Gazzara concedes it to her most self - effacingly in all their scenes together. The plot - a detective agency gets involved too personally in its clients' affairs - is of minimal importance,it is the performance of the two leads that dominates the movie. Mr Bogdanovich's triumph is in the way his camera seems to love his actors,from \\"Targets\\" onwards.There is a glow about every one of his films that only special artists can coax from an inanimate piece of optical equipment.Miss Hepburn in particular benefits from this love. Extra insights into his work can be obtained from reading the published collections of his essays on stars and directors,principally \\"Who the hell's in it?\\", recently remaindered in UK bookstores. The soundtrack to \\"They all laughed\\" varies from Louis Armstrong's 1947 New York Town Hall concert to Sinatra to Country to Latin,as eclectic as the city it portrays.

Public speaking is not a \\"gift\\" like musical talent or being able to draw. Anybody who can talk can speak in public. Here are some tips:     Keep it simple. Your audience is going to learn one or two from your main ideas by heart.  If you can't express, then your speech is not focused well enough. And if you don't have a clear idea of what you want to say, then your audience will have no interest in your speech.      Get organized. No matter how long or short your speech is, you'd better get your materials in order: how you're going to start, what major points you want to make and how you're going to close. You may often write the last sentence first. When you know what your aim is, you can choose any ways to get there. A strong close is powerful.

Answer this question: where does the movie monster trucks take place??","output":"The movie \\"Monster Trucks\\" takes place in multiple settings, primarily in the fictional town of North Dakota called \\"Midpoint\\", resembling a typical small American town with vast oil fields surrounding it. Directed by Chris Wedge and released in 2016, the film combines elements of science fiction, action, and comedy to create a truly unique experience for viewers. One of the main settings in \\"Monster Trucks\\" is Tripp's high school, which he attends in Midpoint. Throughout the movie, various scenes feature the school's exterior and interior, including its hallways, classrooms, and the auto shop where Tripp (played by Lucas Till) works on trucks as part of an after-school activity. Another significant location is the Terravex Oil Corporation, where the antagonist, Reece Tenneson (played by Rob Lowe), works. The oil corporation plays a significant role in the film, as it inadvertently unearths the subterranean creatures while conducting illegal drilling operations. The oil drilling site is where Tripp discovers the creature that eventually leads to the formation of the monster truck. Several outdoor scenes take place in the vast, rugged terrain around Midpoint, as Tripp and the creature Creech (a combination of the words 'creature' and 'leech') bond and embark on various adventures. With wide open spaces and imposing rock formations, these scenes often involve thrilling chase sequences and near escapes from the Terravex security forces. Aside from these primary settings, the film also includes various other locations such as Tripp's junkyard home, where he first encounters Creech; the local diner where Tripp and his love interest, Meredith (played by Jane Levy), hang out; and the town streets, which become the stage for several high-octane action scenes involving Tripp and Creech's monster truck. Overall, the movie \\"Monster Trucks\\" takes place in a fictionalized version of a small North Dakota town called Midpoint, featuring recognizable American locales such as a high school, oil drilling site, and expansive outdoor landscapes ideal for action-packed sequences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose the next sentence.Police are on red alert at the prospect of drones flying overhead during Sunday’s Manchester derby. Serbia’s Euro 2016 qualifier against bitter rivals Albania had to be abandoned earlier this month after a mass brawl following the landing of a drone carrying a provocative political message landed on the pitch. But while that is the most high-profile case of its kind this season, there has been an instance closer to home. A man was arrested in a supermarket adjacent to the Etihad after flying a drone over the stadium as City thumped Tottenham 4-1 just a fortnight ago. Manchester City host local rivals United in what is expected to be a fiery derby on Sunday In the region of 400 officers are set to be deployed to ensure Manchester United’s trip to OPTIONS: - Albania passes without incident. - City passes without incident. - Etihad passes without incident. - Etihad Stadium passes without incident. - Euro 2016 passes without incident. - Greater Manchester Police passes without incident. - Manchester passes without incident. - Manchester City passes without incident. - Manchester United passes without incident. - Premier League passes without incident. - Serbia passes without incident. - Sportsmail passes without incident. - Tottenham passes without incident. - United passes without incident.","output":"- City passes without incident. In the region of 400 officers are set to be deployed to ensure Manchester United’s trip to City passes without incident. Explanation: The passage above is about the heightened police alert and measures being taken during an upcoming Manchester derby, where Manchester City will host local rivals Manchester United. The correct answer should refer to the location where Manchester United is going and the event that needs to pass without incident.  The other options are incorrect because: - Albania, Serbia, Euro 2016, and Premier League refer to unrelated events or locations that are not the main focus. - Etihad and Etihad Stadium refer to the location, but do not explicitly mention the opposing team (Manchester City). - Greater Manchester Police refers to the police force, but not the event they're securing. - Manchester and Manchester United are already mentioned in the sentence, so they don't provide specific information about the event. - Sportsmail and Tottenham are unrelated to the passage's context and the specific event being discussed. - While \\"United passes without incident\\" could be a viable option, it is less precise and clear than \\"City passes without incident,\\" since \\"City\\" refers directly to Manchester City and the derby match."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It's been maybe 14-15 yrs now and I have no clue what he's doing. I think one of my friends did attend the wedding but it was only because they desperately needed a groomsmen. Ted married this girl who seemed cool at first but after marriage, he stopped coming to any and all get togethers. He always had an excuse.

While the likes of Roger Federer and Serena Williams strut their stuff at Wimbledon, spare a thought for the grass under their feet -- which will take a double pounding in the next two months. Just 20 days after the men's final at the All England Club, the tennis competition at the 2012 London Olympics will begin -- and the team working on the famous courts are keeping their fingers crossed that this week's inclement weather does not cause any further delays. Andy Newell from the Sports Turf Research Institute (STRI) gives Wimbledon head groundsman Eddie Seaward and his staff expert scientific advice on that preparation and admits that any delay into a third week would be a serious problem. \\"They don't want to lose time because they are already on such a fine edge and even a day would mean you lose 5% of your preparation, and that could be crucial,\\" he told CNN. Ten of Wimbledon's courts will be used for the Olympics and it's going to prove Seaward's biggest challenge -- coming in his final year in the job, after more than two decades of involvement. Preparation is the key, and the London Olympic Organizing Committee (LOCOG) insisted on a trial run at Wimbledon after the Games were awarded to the UK capital. Trial run. \\"We worked on them just a couple of years ago to prove to LOCOG that we could do that within a short period of time, get the courts back in pristine condition,\\" Seaward told CNN. But trial run or not, it's still a daunting prospect with little room for error. The grass must be cut to an exact 8 millimeters for optimum performance, and Seaward and his team have to keep a wary eye on that unpredictable British weather -- ground temperature and humidity levels are constantly measured. For this reason, the expertise of scientists and agronomists is so important. STRI has been advising Wimbledon for over a decade. At its main testing center in a little corner of West Yorkshire, in northern England, its staff have recreated their own versions of Centre Court -- trialing different varieties of grass to provide the best and most resilient surface. \\"We can test the grasses that they may use in the future here, \\" said Newell, STRI's head of turf grass biology. \\"We can whittle them down, we can get rid of the chaff, hopefully keep the wheat for them.\\" Best grass. Over the years, Newell and his colleagues have come to the conclusion that perennial ryegrass provides the best surface, both in terms of wear and playing characteristics. \\"In essence we've moved from one grass species which was inappropriate for Wimbledon, to one which was the best for Wimbledon,\\" says STRI chief executive Gordon McKillop. The company has grown to employ up to 85 people, and Wimbledon forms just part of their work. The cricket pitches at Lord's, the fairways and greens of St. Andrews, the home of golf, and the football turf for Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine have all had their grass tried and tested at STRI's research center in Bingley. When the pitch at the Euro 2012 game between France and the Ukraine dramatically flooded, experts from STRI were on hand to monitor its drying out. They had advised using a vacuum pump system when the Donbass Arena in Donetsk was constructed, and it paid off. Weather gods. The team working on Wimbledon and the Olympics had been keeping their fingers crossed for the perfect growing conditions at SW19 in July and August. \\"Two weeks of wall-to-wall sunshine, not unbearably hot, with the odd contrast in conditions, perhaps a bit of rain, would make our job much easier,\\" said Newell. But true to form the British weather has misbehaved during the championships and the inevitable rain delays have left organizers with more than a few headaches. For Newell the effect of such a varied climate on growing conditions is the bread and butter of his work. He has installed micro weather stations at Wimbledon to aid his research, as well as digging a small hole on Centre Court to measure moisture levels. \\"It's quite an important hole because it allows me to measure how much moisture there is at different depths,\\" Newell said. \\"Moisture is needed for the grass to grow, but it's also needed in the sense that we've got to dry it out to get the ball to bounce.\\" Surprise tactic. The playing characteristics of the courts at Wimbledon have been the subject of debate and no little controversy over the years, with claims it now favors baseline play rather than classic serve and volley. Newell said the trend was more to do with the strength of the players, their rackets and the balls that are being used, rather than the surfaces being prepared. \\"Players now use serve and volley as a surprise tactic rather than the norm,\\" he said. During Seaward's time at the All England Club, he has seen that change of tactics reflected on the worn parts of his courts. \\"When I first started here, the players used to serve and run in to return the ball, they used to check and stop and wear the grass out and there's a patch in the middle there. That slowly but surely moved further back every year, until it's completely disappeared,\\" he said. Without the likes of Boris Becker and Pete Sampras charging forward to scuff up the grass in the middle of the court, the task of the groundsman has become rather easier, particularly with the tight Olympic deadline in mind. Seaward and his team will begin their Olympic work even while play is still taking place on the show courts. \\"We know the baseline is more worn than the rest of it, but by the time you get a bit of water on it, it starts to green up a bit,\\" he said. Nature's way. The secret is using pre-germinated, or pre-grown seed, which is sowed into the worn patches. \\"We've got to try to get some grass back in there, in a very short space of time,\\" Seaward said. \\"Within a few days it will be up, hopefully, and we'll be preparing the courts.\\" And bearing this in mind, there is a plus side to the constant drizzle that is coming out of the cloudy skies of London in what has proved a pretty miserable summer. \\"For growing grass, rain is a bonus,\\" said Newell, adding that water from the sky falls more evenly than that supplied by artificial sprinklers. Newell believes that the soil texture underneath the grass is just as important in determining the playing characteristics, but knows that when hosting the biggest sports show on earth, aesthetics are important. \\"The idea is that we get the court to look the way it's going to look on the opening Monday of Wimbledon.\\" But he warned: \\"It all comes back to nature, and nature can't be rushed.\\" If the joint efforts of all those involved are ultimately successful, perhaps the International Olympic Committee could award a special gold medal to Seaward and his extended team -- because working around the clock, they may well have deserved it.

Through a broader lens, the film Teza focuses on the ways in which political upheaval and social change have impacted cultures and nations across the larger African Diaspora.Told mainly through a series of flashbacks, Teza follows the personal narrative of Anberber, who, after leaving Ethiopia for Germany to become a doctor, is led to return to his home village by lingering spirits and haunting visions from his childhood. Using the power of memory as its primary device, Teza recounts the historical circumstances that have framed the context in which contemporary Ethiopia exists.The movie chronicles Anberber's internal struggle to stay true--both to himself and to his homeland--but above all, the film explores the possession of memory, a right that humanity mandates that each of us have--the right to own our pasts. My question: Where does Anberber escape to? Answer:","output":"Anberber escapes to Germany."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

The first time I stayed here, it wasn't half bad. I stayed in a spacious two bedroom suite, not too shabby.  It had some decent amenities (i.e. lazy river, good location from the strip, and a convenient Dennys located right by the hotel) and I also signed up for an AMAZING massage!    However, this time it was disappointingly different. I'm talking about smelly and soggy carpeting, busted light bulb, and our hotel door that you had to throw your shoulder into in order to open it.  But the cherry on top of a not so lovely experience, was the screaming children up and down the hallway, the paper thin walls which you could hear EVERYTHING and the apathetic staff who can really give a rat's ass.

Furthermore, the combination of high school romance, teenage adventure, and overcoming personal challenges may provide a relatable story for viewers, especially those in a similar stage of their lives. However, it is essential to consider certain risks involved in supporting this film proposal. The adult film industry backdrop may be a controversial subject, potentially leading to criticisms and limiting the target audience. Viewers with more conservative values may shy away from the content, impacting the film's overall reach and profitability. In conclusion, as an investment decision, the film proposal for \\"The Girl Next Door\\" has a blend of strong points and potential risks. Supporting this film may be a worthwhile investment if you believe in its artistic vision and ability to resonate with viewers through relatable themes and talented actors. However, the nature of its content may also be a limiting factor due to potential controversies or resistance from conservative audience members, and it is crucial to factor this into the final decision."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The presentation will be in Prezi.\\".","output":"Title: Understanding Natural Selection: A Comprehensive Dive into its History, Significance, and Impact on Humanity Tim: (Opening slide with title) Good morning/afternoon, everyone. We're Tim and Samantha, and today we'll be presenting a comprehensive understanding of natural selection. We'll begin with a brief overview of the history of the concept, followed by the evidence that supports it, then move onto the modern definition, and finally, discuss why it matters to humanity. [Slide transition] Samantha: (Slide with portraits of influential scientists) Let's begin our journey with the history of natural selection. Although Charles Darwin is often credited for the concept, other scientists and philosophers such as Alfred Russel Wallace and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck contributed to its development. Darwin's groundbreaking work, \\"On the Origin of Species,\\" was published in 1859. Darwin's theory postulated that species evolve through a process he called \\"natural selection,\\" where organisms with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce. [Slide transition] Samantha: (Slide with various evidence supporting natural selection) Over time, significant evidence has supported the idea of natural selection. One such example is the famous case of the peppered moth. Before the Industrial Revolution, light-colored moths were more common, as they blended with tree trunks. However, as soot particles blackened the trees, the dark-colored moths became more common since they were now better camouflaged. This is evidence of natural selection in action, as moths with advantageous traits were able to survive and reproduce at a higher rate. [Slide transition] Tim: (Slide with the modern definition) Now that we've had a look at the history and evidence of natural selection, let's explore the modern definition. Drawing from Richard Dawkins' book, \\"The Selfish Gene,\\" natural selection can be seen as a process that favors not just the organism, but the survival and reproduction of genes. Dawkins argues that organisms are simply vessels for genes, and that the primary goal of a gene is to make more copies of itself. [Slide transition] Tim: (Slide showing the relevance of natural selection to the humanity) So, why does understanding natural selection matter to humanity? First, it provides a framework to comprehend the biological changes we see in the world around us. For instance, natural selection helps explain why antibiotic resistance is becoming increasingly prevalent. Bacteria with genes that confer resistance to antibiotics are more likely to survive and reproduce, leading to a population with a higher prevalence of antibiotic-resistant individuals. [Slide transition] Samantha: (Slide with examples of human evolution) Additionally, understanding natural selection helps us piece together our own evolutionary history. For instance, our ancestors had to adapt to environmental changes such as fluctuating climates and habitats. Through natural selection, human populations developed traits that enabled them to survive and thrive in a variety of environments. For example, the ability to maintain and regulate body heat allowed humans to inhabit colder regions of the world. [Slide transition] Tim: (Slide explaining the ethical implications) Lastly, grasping the concept of natural selection helps us confront the ethical implications it may have on our society. As we continue to advance in areas such as genetic engineering and gene editing, we must be cautious of the potential consequences of interfering with the natural course of evolution. Understanding natural selection can help guide our decision-making, ensuring that we act responsibly and ethically when dealing with the genetic future of our species. [Closing slide with a summary of main points] Samantha: In conclusion, natural selection has been a vital concept in understanding biological adaptation and evolution. From providing insight into our own evolutionary history to guiding our approach to genetic technologies, understanding natural selection is essential for the continued growth and development of our species. Tim: We hope you enjoyed our presentation and that it has given you a deeper understanding of natural selection's importance in our world. Thank you all for listening.
