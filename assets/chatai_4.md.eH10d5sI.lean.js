The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency landed the rovers on the asteroid Ryugu, which is roughly 200 million miles from Earth. The rovers will study the asteroid's surface and seismic activity, and will measure the temperature and pressure of its soil. Ryugu is a potentially hazardous asteroid, meaning it could impact Earth in the future, according to NASA. The rovers were released from the spacecraft Hayabusa2, which will now study the asteroid in greater detail before returning to Earth with rock samples in 2020. The mission will also help scientists understand how the solar system was formed, says JAXA.","output":"Japan Makes History by Landing Two Rovers on Ryugu Asteroid In a major milestone for space exploration, Japan has successfully landed two rovers on the Ryugu asteroid, making the country the first one to do so. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) stated that the rovers touched down on the asteroid's surface on September 21, 2018, after their release from the spacecraft Hayabusa2 that has been orbiting Ryugu since June of the same year. The asteroid Ryugu belongs to a class of asteroids referred to as Near-Earth Objects (NEOs), which has a diameter of approximately 1 km and orbits the Sun between Earth and Mars. NASA has classified Ryugu as a \\"potentially hazardous\\" asteroid since it has an orbit that brings it closer to Earth than most asteroids, which poses a threat of impact upon us. The two rovers, known as MINERVA-II1A and MINERVA-II1B, will evaluate the asteroid's seismic activity, scan the surface and collect data on its temperature and soil pressure while navigating across its rugged terrain. The rovers are equipped with cameras and sensors to collect data and take photographs during their exploration. JAXA believes that bringing back data and rock samples from the Ryugu asteroid could offer clues to understanding the origins of the solar system. Although scientists have studied meteorites discovered on Earth, the data collected from the Ryugu asteroid will be the first to be gathered from underground levels, which haven't been affected by the Earth's weather and conditions. Hayabusa2, the spacecraft that carried the rovers, will stay in orbit around Ryugu for up to a year, studying its properties in greater detail before returning to Earth with the samples in 2020. JAXA's mission will deepen scientists' understanding of how Ryugu was formed and its implications for the evolving solar system. \\"This is a big success. Exploration of space is not easy, and we still have much to learn about the Ryugu asteroid,\\" said Yuichi Tsuda, project manager at JAXA.

The adverse effects of climate change are felt globally, and they vary from one region to another, and these changes are adversely impacting agriculture and the global food system. These changes include rising temperature, increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, and shifts in precipitation patterns. One of the biggest impacts of climate change on global food security is related to the loss of crops and decrease in agricultural productivity. As the temperature continues to rise, and droughts become more frequent, and shorter, and less predictable rainfall patterns, the yield of crops also decreases. This means that smallholder farmers and agricultural workers who rely on crops for their livelihoods are more likely to experience food insecurity and malnutrition. In addition, there is an increased likelihood of conflicts and migration as people compete for dwindling resources, particularly in areas already prone to food insecurity. Another impact of climate change on global food security is the decline in the quality of crops. With the changes in rainfall patterns, there are increased cases of pests and diseases, which affect the health and quality of crops. This leads to a decrease in the production of high-quality nutritious crops, such as fruits and vegetables, which are essential for the health of individuals and communities. Climate change also has a significant impact on global trade and food prices. The increased occurrence of extreme weather events such as floods, tropical cyclones, and droughts disrupts the transportation of food to different regions, leading to higher food prices. These price fluctuations make it more difficult for vulnerable populations to access food, particularly those in low-income countries. In conclusion, climate change has severe effects on global food security, with impacts including reduced agricultural productivity, loss of crops, decreased nutritional quality, and increased food prices. It is therefore essential that global leaders take quick and decisive action to tackle climate change and protect the people and businesses in the agricultural sector. This includes implementing effective adaptation strategies to minimize the impact of climate change on agriculture, investing in sustainable agriculture, and supporting sustainable food systems that improve access to nutritious and affordable food for all."},{"instruction":"Maggie is working on a project with her classmates.

What started as a bank robbery gone wrong quickly turned into a tense hostage situation and a high-speed car chase. It all began when four armed individuals entered the downtown branch of First National Bank. They demanded access to the vault and threatened to hurt customers and staff if their demands were not met. However, something went awry, and a panic-stricken teller tripped a silent alarm, alerting the authorities. Within minutes, police arrived on the scene, blocking off the streets and surrounding the building. However, the bank robbers were not about to go down without a fight. They grabbed a handful of customers and bank employees, brandishing their weapons and demanding a way out. The situation quickly escalated into a kidnapping, as the robbers fled the bank with their human shields. They piled into a getaway vehicle and drove off at breakneck speed, with police cars in hot pursuit. The chase ran through several neighborhoods, with the robbers weaving in and out of traffic at dangerous speeds. At one point, they even fired shots at pursuing police cars, causing chaos and endangering innocent bystanders. Finally, the chase came to an abrupt halt, as the robbers crashed their car into a building. They abandoned their car and took shelter in a nearby apartment complex, taking a few hostages with them as a bargaining chip. The situation was tense, with the police negotiating frantically with the robbers to release the hostages and surrender. After several hours of negotiations, a breakthrough occurred, and the robbers finally surrendered, allowing the hostages to be retrieved safely. In the end, multiple individuals were injured, and substantial damage was caused in the wake of these events. However, it's thanks to the bravery and resourcefulness of our police department that this situation didn't turn out worse.

How many more dollars does a pint of strawberries cost when not on sale compared to a pint of blueberries when not on sale?","output":"Let's first find out the non-sale price of a pint of strawberries. If the supermarket made 108 less from the sale of 54 pints of strawberries, then without the sale, they would have made 216 + 108 = 324. Now, we can find the non-sale price per pint of strawberries by dividing the total non-sale amount by the number of pints sold: 324 / 54 pints = 6 per pint. Next, let's find out the non-sale price of a pint of blueberries. If the supermarket made 72 less from the sale of 36 pints of blueberries, then without the sale, they would have made 144 + 72 = 216. Now, we can find the non-sale price per pint of blueberries by dividing the total non-sale amount by the number of pints sold: 216 / 36 pints = 6 per pint. Finally, to find out how many more dollars a pint of strawberries costs when not on sale compared to a pint of blueberries when not on sale, we subtract the non-sale price of blueberries from the non-sale price of strawberries: 6 - 6 = 0.

On the next day, 4 more tomatoes grow on the plant, but a bird comes and eats 25% of all the tomatoes remaining on the plant. How many cherry tomatoes are on the plant now?","output":"Let's solve this step by step: 1. Initially, there are 21 cherry tomatoes on the plant. 2. Two birds eat one-third of the tomatoes:    One-third of 21 is ( frac{1}{3} times 21 = 7 ) tomatoes.    So, after the birds eat, there are ( 21 - 7 = 14 ) tomatoes left. 3. Three more birds come and eat 40% of the remaining tomatoes:    40% of 14 is ( frac{40}{100} times 14 = 5.6 ).    Since birds can't eat a fraction of a tomato, we'll round down to 5 tomatoes eaten.    So, after these birds eat, there are ( 14 - 5 = 9 ) tomatoes left. 4. The plant grows new tomatoes, increasing the number by 50%:    50% of 9 is ( frac{50}{100} times 9 = 4.5 ).    Again, we can't have half a tomato, so we'll round down to 4 new tomatoes.    So, after the new tomatoes grow, there are ( 9 + 4 = 13 ) tomatoes on the plant. 5. On the next day, 4 more tomatoes grow on the plant:    So, now there are ( 13 + 4 = 17 ) tomatoes on the plant. 6.

The problem also states that the tips he made in August were 0.25 (or 1/4) of his total tips for all the months he worked.

When one fourth of the solution is removed, the amount of salt removed is 13% of (1/4)S, which is 0.13 * (1/4)S = 0.0325S. Now, let's denote the percentage of salt in the second solution as x%. When the second solution is added, it is also (1/4)S in amount, and the amount of salt it contributes is (x/100) * (1/4)S. After the replacement, the total amount of the solution is still S, and the total amount of salt is the salt that was in the three fourths of the original solution plus the salt from the second solution. So, the total amount of salt is now: 0.13S - 0.0325S + (x/100) * (1/4)S The problem states that the resulting solution is 16% salt by weight.

En su visión, la democracia en Cuba se materializaría a través de la participación popular directa en los procesos de toma de decisiones a través de las llamadas \\"asambleas del pueblo\\". Estas asambleas, que se celebran en todos los niveles de gobierno, permiten que los ciudadanos expresen sus opiniones, propongan políticas y controlen la gestión de los funcionarios electos.

How do I follow up","output":"In a situation where the customer has not provided any feedback after receiving the appropriate plan and price, it is important to follow up in order to gauge their level of interest and address any concerns they may have. Here are a few steps you can take to follow up effectively: 1. Give them some time: It is possible that the customer needs some time to review the options and make a decision. Before following up, give them a reasonable amount of time, typically a few days or a week, to consider the proposal. 2. Use a polite and friendly approach: When following up, maintain a polite and friendly tone in your communication. Thank the customer for their time and reiterate your interest in helping them find the best solution. This shows professionalism and courtesy. 3. Send a gentle reminder: Craft a brief and concise email or make a phone call to gently remind the customer about the proposal you provided. Mention that you are following up to see if they have any questions, require further clarification, or need assistance with anything. 4. Offer additional information: If the customer hasn't responded, it could mean they are unsure or have specific concerns. In your follow-up, provide additional information or address potential concerns to help them make an informed decision. This could include testimonials, case studies, or any other relevant data. 5. Provide alternative options: If the customer appears hesitant or uninterested in the provided plan and price, offer alternative options that may suit their needs better. Sometimes, customers may need more choices before making a decision. 6. Offer incentives or promotions: If appropriate, consider offering limited-time incentives or promotions to encourage the customer's decision-making process. This can create a sense of urgency and push them towards providing feedback. 7. Seek feedback directly: If you haven't received any response despite multiple follow-ups, it may be helpful to directly inquire about the customer's feedback. Politely ask if there are any issues or concerns preventing them from moving forward or if they require additional assistance. Remember, while following up is crucial, it's also important to respect the customer's decision if they choose not to provide any feedback. Keep the communication open and maintain a positive attitude throughout the follow-up process."},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello!

Some of the key factors include: 1. Weather conditions: Heavy and prolonged rainfall, tropical storms, hurricanes, or snowmelt can cause excessive water accumulation leading to floods. 2. Topography and drainage patterns: Flat or low-lying areas, river basins, and regions with poor natural drainage systems are more susceptible to flooding events. 3. Climate change: Global warming and climate change can influence weather patterns and lead to more intense and frequent rainfall events, increasing the risk of floods. 4. Deforestation: Clearing large areas of forests reduces the natural ability of trees to absorb rainwater, resulting in increased surface runoff and potential flooding. 5. Urbanization and land-use changes: Unplanned urban development, improper drainage systems, and changes in land use (e.g., paving surfaces) can exacerbate flooding by limiting natural water absorption and increasing runoff. 6. Dam failures: Poor maintenance, design flaws, or extreme weather events can lead to the failure of dams or levees, resulting in catastrophic flooding downstream. 7. Human activities: Inappropriate construction in flood-prone areas, improper waste disposal, and channel obstruction (e.g., debris or sand accumulation) can contribute to localized flooding. It is important to note that while these factors play a role in flood occurrence, their specific impact can vary depending on the region and local conditions. Additionally, the severity and frequency of floods can also be influenced by a combination of these factors."},{"instruction":"Distribution of Floods","output":"The distribution of floods can vary greatly depending on geographical location and climate patterns. Some regions are more prone to flooding due to several factors, such as: 1. Riverine floods: Areas located near rivers or in river basins are susceptible to riverine flooding. These floods occur when rivers overflow their banks, often due to heavy rainfall or snowmelt in the upper reaches of the river. 2. Coastal floods: Low-lying coastal areas are at risk of coastal flooding, which can result from storm surges during hurricanes or tropical storms. Rising sea levels due to climate change have also increased the vulnerability of coastal regions to flooding. 3. Flash floods: Flash floods occur when heavy rainfall overwhelms the capacity of the local drainage system, leading to rapid and intense flooding. These floods can occur in both urban and rural areas, often in steep terrains or regions with poorly developed drainage systems. 4. Monsoon floods: Monsoon rainfall in certain parts of the world, like South Asia and Southeast Asia, can lead to significant flooding. These floods are associated with seasonal monsoon winds, which bring heavy rains over a prolonged period. 5. Urban floods: Urban areas can experience localized flooding, often known as urban floods. These occur due to factors like inadequate drainage systems, rapid urbanization, and impermeable surfaces that prevent water absorption. It's important to note that the distribution and frequency of floods can change over time due to various factors, including climate change and human activities. Additionally, some areas may experience multiple types of floods depending on their location and climate patterns."},{"instruction":"Global distribution of floods","output":"Floods occur globally, affecting various regions around the world. However, their frequency, intensity, and distribution can vary significantly. Here is a broad overview of the global distribution of floods: 1. Asia: Many parts of Asia are prone to floods due to the region's monsoon climate. Countries such as India, Bangladesh, China, and Pakistan frequently face devastating flooding during the monsoon season. Rivers like the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Yangtze are particularly prone to flooding. 2. Africa: African countries also experience regular flooding, often related to heavy rainfall or river overflow. Regions prone to flooding include the Niger River basin in West Africa, the Nile River in East Africa, and the Zambezi River in Southern Africa. Countries like Mozambique, Sudan, Nigeria, and Ethiopia are frequently affected by floods. 3. North America: Flooding occurs in various parts of North America, including the United States and Canada. Coastal areas like the Gulf Coast and Atlantic Coast are prone to storm surge flooding during hurricanes. Regions with river systems, such as the Mississippi River and its tributaries, are susceptible to both riverine and flash floods. 4. South America: Countries in South America, such as Brazil, Peru, and Argentina, experience flooding, particularly in the Amazon basin and other areas with dense rainforests. Flash floods can also occur in mountainous regions like the Andes. 5. Europe: European countries are vulnerable to flooding, with major rivers like the Danube, Rhine, and Seine occasionally experiencing floods. Countries like the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and the Netherlands have seen significant flood events in recent years. 6. Oceania: Floods occur in countries across the Pacific Islands and Australia. Tropical cyclones can cause widespread flooding in regions like the Pacific Islands and Fiji. In Australia, flooding is especially common in northern areas during the monsoon season. It's important to note that this is just a general overview, and floods can occur in various other regions as well. Regional and local factors, including climate, topography, and human activities, influence the specific distribution and severity of floods in different parts of the world."},{"instruction":"创口贴过期了使用会有影响么","output":"使用过期的创口贴可能会产生以下影响： 1. 失去疗效：过期的创口贴可能已经失去了其有效成分，因此可能无法有效地阻止出血、促进伤口愈合或防止感染。 2. 感染风险增加：过期的创口贴可能已经失去了其防止细菌感染的功效，因此使用它们可能会增加感染的风险，特别是如果伤口本身已经存在感染。 3. 皮肤过敏或刺激：过期的创口贴可能会导致皮肤过敏或刺激。过期的黏合剂可能已经变质，可能引起皮肤发红、瘙痒、炎症或其他不适症状。 4. 受伤加重：如果创口贴的黏性已经减弱或失效，可能无法有效地固定创口边缘，从而导致受伤恶化或伤口重新打开。 因此，为了确保创口贴的有效性和安全性，建议不要使用过期的创口贴。如果没有未过期的创口贴可用，最好选择其他合适的方法来处理伤口，比如使用无菌纱布和医用胶带来固定伤口，并及时就医。"},{"instruction":"write a cover letter using the job description \\"The Group Manager is responsible for working with the Center Director, other group managers and the IDS team to develop a growth strategy for the group, identify and hire staff with capabilities that support the group’s goals, and manage staff performance.

The algorithm uses AutoLISP programming language and AutoCAD software to create triangular mesh elements based on input geometry data. The code is described step-by-step, highlighting the key variables and processes involved. The implementation also includes the usage of external libraries and functions to enhance the mesh generation process. The results of the FFMESHK algorithm are validated through the analysis of generated meshes for different input geometries. 1. Introduction Mesh generation is an essential step in various fields of engineering and scientific simulations. It involves discretizing a domain into a collection of interconnected elements to represent complex geometries. The FFMESHK algorithm provides a robust and efficient approach to generate 3D triangular meshes in AutoCAD. 2. Methodology The FFMESHK algorithm utilizes the AutoLISP programming language to drive the mesh generation process in AutoCAD. The code begins with loading necessary external files and setting required AutoCAD variables. The input data, consisting of vertices and their respective coordinates, is read from a file. 3. Mesh Generation Steps The FFMESHK algorithm proceeds by iterating through the input data and appending vertices coordinates to different arrays. The number of vertices is stored for each iteration and accumulated to track the total number of vertices processed. The algorithm checks if it is the first iteration and initializes a file to store the mesh generation commands. 4. Creating Mesh Elements For each vertex, the FFMESHK algorithm generates a string representing the vertex's coordinates and writes it to the mesh generation file. Additional variables are computed to define the spatial relationships between vertices, such as connecting adjacent vertices based on predetermined rules. 5. Mesh Generation Optimization To enhance the mesh generation process, external functions and libraries, such as KROMS and KROMS1, are utilized. These libraries provide additional capabilities for connecting vertices and optimizing the mesh generation. 6. Validation and Results The resulting mesh generated by the FFMESHK algorithm is thoroughly analyzed using different evaluation metrics. The quality of the mesh, such as element size and aspect ratio, is assessed to ensure accuracy and consistency. Comparisons with other mesh generation algorithms are also performed to validate the effectiveness of the FFMESHK algorithm. 7. Conclusion The FFMESHK algorithm presented in this article demonstrates an efficient approach to generate 3D meshes in AutoCAD using AutoLISP programming. The code implementation, along with the utilization of external libraries, allows for accurate and optimized triangular mesh generation. The results obtained through validation and analysis indicate the algorithm's effectiveness and suitability for various engineering and scientific simulations. References: 1. Smith, J. et al. (2010).

Алгоритм FFMESHK предоставляет надежный и эффективный подход для генерации трехмерных треугольных сеток в AutoCAD. 2. Методология Алгоритм FFMESHK использует язык программирования AutoLISP для управления процессом генерации сетки в AutoCAD. Код начинается с загрузки необходимых внешних файлов и установки необходимых переменных AutoCAD. Входные данные, состоящие из вершин и их координат, считываются из файла. 3. Шаги генерации сетки Алгоритм FFMESHK проходит через входные данные и добавляет координаты вершин в различные массивы. Количество вершин сохраняется для каждой итерации и накапливается для отслеживания общего числа обработанных вершин. Алгоритм проверяет, является ли это первой итерацией и инициализирует файл для хранения команд генерации сетки. 4. Создание элементов сетки Для каждой вершины алгоритм FFMESHK генерирует строку, представляющую координаты вершины, и записывает ее в файл генерации сетки. Вычисляются дополнительные переменные, определяющие пространственные отношения между вершинами, такие как соединение смежных вершин на основе заранее определенных правил. 5. Оптимизация генерации сетки Для улучшения процесса генерации сетки используются внешние функции и библиотеки, такие как KROMS и KROMS1. Эти библиотеки предоставляют дополнительные возможности для соединения вершин и оптимизации генерации сетки. 6.

The company was founded in 2007 by four former execu4ves of larger firms, looking to strike out focus on the digital space. It currently employs 45 marketers and marke4ng assistants at various levels, alongside 22 support staff. During the company’s rapid growth, its opera4ng approach has shiIed significantly. Early on, it recruited a few, highly experienced marketers. Each reported to one of the founding partners when working with a specific client but oIen worked with different partners simultaneously on different accounts. These marketers were involved in all aspects of campaign development and implementa4on. The company prided itself on its collegiate approach and flexibility. This extended to both teams management and working condi4ons; the company was founded with a focus on “modern” flexible working prac4ces and has allowed flexible and remote working for all non-admin staff, since its incep4on. Since it was founded, Cadmium has expanded. The expansion has seen a driI toward more formalised teams, with the founding partners taking an increasingly hands off approach to account management. Addi4onally, many of the company’s original marketers rose to become junior partners and head up teams working on specific accounts. Teams have also become increasingly specialised, both in terms of the types of accounts each works on, and the work that specific marketers undertake. The company has also taken on staff with a greater range of experience levels, including crea4ng a graduate development scheme. The firm also became reliant on outsourcing some of the more repe44ve aspects of the marke4ng process, par4cularly copywri4ng, graphic design, and affiliate development to other firms and freelance contractors. These changes have been largely unplanned, but generally well received, with employees expressing sa4sfac4on with their work and the company having a reputa4on as a good employer, with commensurately low turnover.

Currently managers are relying on more experienced staff for tasks such as copywri4ng, leading to resentment from many who see this as something they had “moved beyond” in their careers. Some indicate that they accepted roles at the firm to “get away” from those types of tasks.

Conduct a thorough assessment and analysis: Before making any changes, it is important to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the current situation. This should include evaluating the impact of the changing market, understanding the reasons behind the decrease in the quality of freelance services, and identifying the key issues causing dissatisfaction among staff. 2. Prioritize the issues: Given the limited resources and uncertainty in the company's financial position, it is important to prioritize the issues that need to be addressed first. This can be done by considering the impact of each issue on the overall performance and competitiveness of the company. 3. Focus on improving freelance services: The decrease in the quality of freelance services needs to be addressed to ensure timely project delivery and maintain client satisfaction. Consider reviewing the selection process for freelance contractors, setting clear expectations and requirements, and establishing a feedback loop for continuous improvement. 4. Enhance training and development programs: It is crucial to provide necessary training and development opportunities for the junior staff who lack experience in the new tasks they are being asked to undertake. This will help them build the skills and knowledge required to perform their new roles effectively. 5. Improve communication and transparency: The atmosphere within the organization has been negatively affected by the recent changes and the manner in which they were introduced. It is important for the senior partners to improve communication and transparency with the rest of the staff. This can be achieved through regular team meetings, clear communication of company goals and strategies, and involving staff in decision-making processes. 6. Develop a clear strategic direction: The senior partners should work on developing a clear strategic direction for the company. This should take into account the changes in the market, the company's competitive position, and the resources available. Once the direction is established, it will be easier to make decisions regarding hiring replacements for departed employees and addressing other issues. 7. Evaluate management consultancy bids: The senior partners should carefully evaluate the bids received from management consultancies. Consider their expertise, track record, and proposed approach to addressing the company's issues. Additionally, consider the cost implications and the potential return on investment of each consultancy's proposed solutions. 8. Develop a timeline for implementing changes: Once the key issues and solutions are identified, create a realistic timeline for implementing the necessary changes. Consider the practical implications and costs of each change to ensure they can be effectively executed. Overall, it is important for Cadmium to adapt to the changing market while maintaining employee satisfaction and competitiveness. By addressing the key issues identified in the case study and implementing the recommended strategies, the company can work towards overcoming its current challenges and positioning itself for future success."},{"instruction":"How to improve staff turn over in this case study Cadmium is a medium sized, bespoke digital marke4ng company.

Address the concerns: The company needs to address the concerns and dissatisfaction among staff regarding the new approach and its introduction. This can be done through open and transparent communication, listening to their feedback, and providing support and training to help them adapt to their new roles and responsibilities. 2. Provide training and development opportunities: Since many junior staff lack experience in the tasks they are now being asked to undertake, it is crucial to provide them with appropriate training and development opportunities. This can include workshops, mentoring programs, and job rotations to help them gain the necessary skills and knowledge. 3. Balance workload and responsibilities: Ensure that workload and responsibilities are distributed fairly among the team members. This can help alleviate resentment and frustration among staff and prevent overburdening more experienced employees. Regularly review and adjust workload distribution as needed. 4. Reinforce the company culture: While changes in the company's operations and approach are necessary, it is important to maintain a positive and supportive company culture. This can be achieved through team-building activities, recognition and rewards programs, and fostering a sense of belonging and camaraderie among employees. 5. Enhance remote working policies: Since competitors have implemented flexible and remote working practices, Cadmium can explore ways to enhance its remote working policies. This can include providing the necessary tools and resources to effectively work remotely, promoting work-life balance, and ensuring adequate communication and collaboration among team members. 6. Improve support from senior partners: Address the concerns raised by team leaders regarding the distant behavior of senior partners. Ensure that senior partners are actively involved in decision-making processes and provide support and guidance to the team leaders. 7. Conduct stay interviews: Instead of solely relying on exit interviews to understand the reasons for staff turnover, consider conducting stay interviews with the remaining employees. This can help identify ongoing concerns and implement improvements to retain valuable staff. 8. Offer career development opportunities: Recognize and promote the experience and expertise gained by employees in specialist areas. Provide opportunities for career growth within the company, such as internal promotions, project leadership roles, and involvement in strategic initiatives. 9. Regularly review and adjust outsourcing strategy: Evaluate the quality and reliability of freelance services regularly. If there are ongoing issues with the quality of freelance copywriting, consider reevaluating and adjusting the outsourcing strategy or finding alternative solutions, such as building an in-house copywriting team. 10. Seek professional advice from management consultancies: Engage with management consultancies to help identify the most critical issues and provide recommendations for tackling them. Focus on solutions that align with the company's financial limitations and ensure a clear timeline for implementation. By implementing these recommendations, Cadmium Digital Marketing Company can create a positive work environment, address staff concerns, and improve staff turnover.

Hoje temos um debate entre a filósofa e escritora russa-estadunidense Ayn Rand e o filósofo alemão Friedrich Schelling. O tema em discussão é a relação entre o indivíduo e a sociedade. Ayn Rand, você defende um pensamento individualista radical, enquanto Friedrich Schelling é conhecido por suas teorias sobre a interconexão entre o indivíduo e o todo. Ayn Rand, por favor, inicie o debate. AR: Obrigada, moderador. Acredito que o indivíduo é a unidade fundamental da sociedade. Cada pessoa deve buscar sua própria felicidade e realizar seus objetivos sem interferência do Estado ou de outros indivíduos. Defendo a liberdade individual, o livre mercado e a propriedade privada como pilares para uma sociedade próspera. FS: Ayn Rand, suas ideias são demasiadamente simplistas. O indivíduo não pode negar a sua interdependência com o coletivo. Na verdade, acreditamos que a verdadeira realização individual ocorre quando encontramos nosso lugar dentro da sociedade e contribuímos para o bem comum. O indivíduo não pode ser considerado isoladamente, pois faz parte de um todo maior. AR: Friedrich Schelling, você está negligenciando a importância da autonomia individual. Cada ser humano possui seus próprios dons, talentos e metas. A interferência do coletivo na liberdade individual é uma forma de tirania. Além disso, a propriedade privada é um direito natural que protege a liberdade e promove a eficiência econômica. FS: Ayn Rand, você parte de uma visão atomística do indivíduo, esquecendo que nossa identidade é forjada em interação com a sociedade. A liberdade individual deve ser equilibrada com a responsabilidade social. Sem a cooperação e o apoio mútuo entre os indivíduos, desigualdades extremas surgem, prejudicando a harmonia social e gerando instabilidade. AR: Friedrich Schelling, essa ideia de equilíbrio entre liberdade individual e responsabilidade social pode facilmente levar ao coletivismo e à tirania da maioria sobre os direitos e liberdades individuais. Defendo que cada pessoa tenha o direito de desfrutar dos frutos do seu próprio trabalho e de tomar suas próprias decisões sem interferência externa. FS: Ayn Rand, sua defesa inflexível do individualismo leva à competição desenfreada e à exploração dos mais fracos. É importante reconhecermos que a sociedade é um organismo complexo, que precisa de cooperação e solidariedade para funcionar de forma harmoniosa. Devemos buscar maneiras justas de distribuir recursos e garantir igualdade de oportunidades a todos. M: Infelizmente, o tempo para este debate chegou ao fim. Agradecemos a Ayn Rand e Friedrich Schelling por suas contribuições. Esse foi um debate intenso e interessante sobre a relação entre o indivíduo e a sociedade. Cada um de vocês apresentou perspectivas valiosas, destacando a importância tanto do indivíduo quanto do coletivo.

You have defined LED3 as \`PC3\`, which should be correct, but you should also ensure all other parts regarding the hardware setup and the code are correct. Please check the following: 1. Verify the connection of the third LED to pin \`PC3\` on the ATmega32A. Inspect the circuit for proper wiring, ensure the LED is not damaged or inserted backward, and check that the resistor value used is appropriate for limiting current. 2. Ensure that there's no short circuit or open circuit in the connections to \`PC3\`. 3. Validate the value of \`threshold3\`. The value \`682\` should indeed correspond to a higher voltage read on the ADC compared to \`threshold2\` and \`threshold1\`. If the input voltage never exceeds \`threshold3\`, the third LED will not turn on. 4. Double-check if there are any hardware issues with the pin \`PC3\` itself. If possible, try using another pin for the third LED to see if the issue is with the microcontroller pin. 5. Ensure the third LED is not defective by swapping it with one of the known working LEDs. 6. If you're using a breadboard, check if there are loose contacts or a need for jumper wire replacements. 7. If you're using a custom-designed PCB, check if there might be an error in the PCB design or assembly that affects the connection to \`PC3\`. If all of these hardware checks are fine, it's worth verifying and recompiling your code. Make sure that after uploading, the ATmega32A is indeed executing the new code. If your hardware checks out and the problem persists, consider toggling another pin instead of \`PC3\` to verify if the code can control another pin. Reassign \`LED3\` to another port and pin that's free, updated both in the definition and in the code, and see if the issue persists. If none of these steps resolve the issue, you might have a faulty microcontroller. Test the ATmega32A with a simple LED blink program on \`PC3\` to isolate the problem to just that pin and rule out any other factors. This process should help you identify the problem. Once you verify each step and confirm that the hardware and connections are all functional, your code should work as intended to turn on all three LEDs based on the ADC value from the potentiometer."},{"instruction":"New Chat Модель: gpt-3.5-turbo Макс. токенов: 4000 Температура: 1 Top-p: 1 Штраф за присутствие: 0 Штраф за частоту: 0 Система You are ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI.

Пользователь Technological advances have almost certainly improved access to education, resulting in more students gaining certificates, diplomas or graduating with degrees. Despite this, there may who use technology dishonestly. be a minonty These are serious issues that require further consideration Generally speaking, computer technology in classrooms has made education and qualifications accessible to a wider range of people, and this is particularly true for those with disabilities. There are undoubtedly many new opportunities for those outside the classroom as well. For example, the advent of online courses has improved access to qualifications for people living in remote areas or poorer nations. What is more, the flexibility of innovations such as flipped classrooms allows those who are sick or have other commitments to keep up with classwork. On the other hand, some students use technology to cheat in exams, perhaps by accessing information on hidden devices. Furthermore using the Internet, students sometimes plagiarise the work of others when writing assignments even though they risk failing if they are caught Finally, there have been cases of wealthy students paying someone else to do an online course for them. However, schools and colleges can also use technology to limit cheating, for example using a webcam to film students taking tests or software that checks essays for plagiarism TO sum up, technology allows a greater variety of people to participate in education and be awarded a qualification although some students seem to do this boy cheating In my view, while educators should welcome technological advances, they should also put in place safeguards to ensure technology is not abused Sum up the main idea and do it Ассистент The main idea of the passage is that technological advances have significantly improved access to education, allowing a broader range of individuals, including those with disabilities and in remote areas, to gain certificates, diplomas, or degrees. However, the author acknowledges that a minority of students may misuse technology for dishonest practices such as cheating in exams, plagiarizing assignments, or even paying others to complete courses. Despite these challenges, the passage suggests that schools and colleges can leverage technology to implement safeguards, such as webcam monitoring and plagiarism-checking software, to mitigate dishonest behavior. The overall stance is that while educators should embrace technological progress, they must also establish measures to prevent its misuse.

Vamos começar com uma pergunta para Ayn Rand: você é conhecida por promover o individualismo e o egoísmo racional, argumentando que o interesse próprio é a base da moralidade. Como você concilia essa visão com o bem comum? Ayn Rand: Obrigada pela pergunta. Eu acredito que o individualismo e o egoísmo racional são os fundamentos da sociedade harmoniosa. Quando cada indivíduo busca seus próprios interesses de maneira racional, isso leva ao bem-estar geral. A cooperação voluntária é a chave para o progresso, e é por meio da liberdade individual que cada pessoa pode alcançar seu potencial máximo. Moderador: Obrigado, Ayn Rand. Agora, vamos para Friedrich Schelling: você é um filósofo associado ao idealismo alemão, que acredita que a realidade é construída pela interação entre sujeito e objeto. Como você vê a relação entre o individualismo e a busca pelo bem comum? Friedrich Schelling: Obrigado pelo convite. Eu acredito que a busca pelo bem comum não é necessariamente oposta ao individualismo. Na verdade, acredito que a realização do indivíduo ocorre dentro do contexto de uma comunidade. O bem comum é alcançado quando cada indivíduo reconhece sua interconexão com os outros e age em conformidade. O indivíduo só pode desenvolver seu verdadeiro potencial quando se sente parte de algo maior do que ele mesmo. Moderador: Ayn Rand, qual é a sua resposta a esse argumento? Ayn Rand: Obrigada, Friedrich Schelling. No entanto, eu acredito que cada indivíduo é um fim em si mesmo e tem o direito de buscar seus próprios interesses em primeiro lugar. O bem comum não pode ser alcançado por meio da coerção ou da restrição dos indivíduos, mas sim através de sua liberdade de buscar o que é melhor para si mesmos. Quando cada pessoa é livre para agir de acordo com o seu próprio julgamento e se beneficiar de suas próprias conquistas, toda a sociedade prospera. Moderador: Friedrich Schelling, você gostaria de responder? Friedrich Schelling: Certamente. Acredito que o conceito de liberdade de Ayn Rand é importante, mas é preciso considerar que a liberdade individual não pode ser absoluta. Ela deve estar dentro dos limites do bem comum, pois a sociedade é feita de indivíduos que se inter-relacionam. Devemos reconhecer a interdependência entre os seres humanos e buscar uma harmonia entre a individualidade e a coletividade. Moderador: Obrigado a ambos. Agora vamos para a última pergunta: como vocês veem o individualismo em relação à justiça social? Ayn Rand: A justiça social, na minha visão, não deve ser confundida com igualdade de resultados. Cada indivíduo é responsável pelo seu próprio sucesso ou fracasso. A justiça deve ser baseada na proteção dos direitos individuais, garantindo que cada pessoa possa desfrutar dos frutos do seu trabalho e propriedade, sem ser explorada pelos outros. Friedrich Schelling: Acredito que a justiça social é fundamental para uma sociedade equilibrada. É importante considerar a distribuição justa dos recursos e oportunidades, para que todos tenham acesso a condições mínimas necessárias para uma vida digna. A igualdade de oportunidades promove a liberdade individual e a possibilidade de desenvolvimento pleno de cada ser humano. Moderador: Muito obrigado a ambos por suas perspectivas interessantes. Infelizmente, nosso tempo acabou. Foi um debate fascinante entre Ayn Rand e Friedrich Schelling.

Martha Chikwezga, Treasurer of Fishland Ladies, emphasized that as a cooperative led by young women, they have received significant support from Nyampesi Fish Products Company and the Department of Fisheries. This support has enabled them to adopt new fish processing technologies that promote environmental conservation and sustainable fisheries practices. \\"With our privately-owned boat, we employ men for fishing on behalf of our cooperative. After processing the fish, we sell them to Nyampesi Fish Products Company at favorable prices, and we are truly grateful for that,\\" Chikwezga expressed to the visiting fish processors. Bahat Stambuli, a representative of the visiting fish processors, expressed gratitude to Pact Malawi for arranging the valuable exchange visit. Stambuli highlighted the importance of learning about modern fish processing technologies, specifically mentioning the Chitofu 3 in 1. She emphasized that their cooperative would make every effort to collaborate with Nyampesi to maximize income from their fish processing business. Neverson Msusa, the District Fisheries Officer (DFO) of Mangochi, conveyed his thanks to the REFRESH project for funding the event. He emphasized the significance of such initiatives in enabling fish processors to engage and exchange ideas on the optimal use of modern fish processing technologies, which are vital for environmental conservation and sustainable management of fisheries resources.

Here's an edited version of the content: MONKEY-BAY, Malawi (Planet Defence) - The USAID-funded Restoring Fisheries for Sustainable Livelihoods in Lake Malawi (REFRESH) project recently organized an exchange visit for fish processors from Nkhotakota and Salima districts. The aim was to provide them with an opportunity to learn and appreciate the operations of Nyampesi Fish Products Company and Fish Landladies, both located in Monkey Bay, Mangochi. Hamis Nyampesi, the Managing Director of Nyampesi Fish Products, shared insights about his company during the exchange visit. Established in 2016, their primary objective is to purchase and process fish using environmentally-friendly processing technologies. They believe in working with youths and women, which is why they have a business partnership with Fishland Ladies.

LoCAL channels finance to decentralised local government authorities and their communities to cover the additional costs of mitigating and adapting impacts of climate change and thereby minimising and addressing potential loss and damage. Designed in 2011 and managed by the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) the facility supports LoCAL country-owned mechanisms for climate finance delivery that have revised adaptation solutions for more than 16 million people around the world. More than 30 countries across Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and the Pacific have engaged with LoCAL to deliver resilience-building solutions for climate vulnerable populations. Tawonga Mbale Luka, Director of Environmental Affairs began by saying that climate change is causing devastating impacts on all productive sectors of Malawi. The impacts we continue to observe in our communities further emphasize the high levels of vulnerability. From our policies and other strategic frameworks, it is clear that we have several challenges that are hindering our ability to build the resilience and improve the adaptive capacity of our communities, and ecosystems, and no challenge is more pronounced than the shortage of financing to implement the strategic actions that we have devised to solve some of our issues. In recognition of this challenge, as the focal point on matters of climate change management, Environmental Affairs Department has partnered with the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) to deploy the Local Climate Adaptive Living Mechanism (LoCAL) in Malawi. The aim is to establish a Performance Based Climate Resilience Granting system to local councils to implement climate change interventions. “The LoCAL is a mechanism that will enable us to channel climate finance to local governments. The mechanism will utilize existing Government financial management systems to empower local authorities to implement resilience building initiatives in line with district development priorities whilst also being aligned to national priorities on adaptation. LoCAL not only responds to national needs in climate change management, but is also aligned to respond to several the globally accepted Sustainable Development Goals e.g. SDG 13 on Climate Action,” said Mbale Luka in her inaugural address. According to Luka, Malawi joins the group of Least Developed Countries that are utilizing the LoCAL to address significant financial challenges within the climate change space. This training session has therefore been organized with the intention to create awareness of the LoCAL Climate Adaptive Living Facility, its application in Malawi as well as discuss proposals for utilisation of Performance Based Climate Resilient Grant (PBCRG). Yusuf Mkungula, Principal Secretary of Natural Resources and Climate Change made emphasis that the intensity and occurrence of extreme weather events continues to devastate people’s lives and livelihoods, ecosystems and on the country’s economy in general. Mkungula cited for instance, earlier this year, when Malawi was ravaged by flooding, mudslides, and heavy rains compounded by strong winds as cyclone Freddy tore through many districts in the southern region of Malawi. The Cyclone affected over 2 million Malawians with the estimated monetary loss amounting to 506.7 million. As a country, such “As a Least Developed Country, Malawi’s financial and technical ability to respond to the impacts of extreme weather events is limited. Through various policies and strategic frameworks i.e. the Malawi 2063, National Resilience Strategy, National Climate Change Management Policy, and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), we have, together, designed various measures to respond accordingly to build the resilience and adaptive capacity of the vulnerable communities and ecosystems,” stressed Mkungula in his address. ‘ He suggested a need to engage innovative sources of climate finance if the country is to deploy the necessary actions. ‘For instance, the Malawi NDC Report has estimated Malawi requires an estimated external and domestic financial support to the tune of forty-six billion United States Dollars (46, 000,000,000), to fully implement the priority measures listed in the NDC. I am sure that you will agree with me that indeed this is a significant amount and will therefore require external support to ensure that the set goals are met. We need financing that is accessible and adequate to meet the needs,” observed Mkungula adding the this led to Government has partnered with the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) to implement the Local Climate Adaptive Living (LoCAL) Facility Project which will ensure that selected communities in the target project areas in the country, namely, Nkhota-kota, Mwanza and Mulanje districts are equipped to respond to the adverse impacts cand also to be resilient against future occurrences.","output":"A two-day training on the Local Climate Adaptive Living Facility (LoCAL) mechanism is currently taking place in Salima district, involving three councils - Mwanza, Mulanje, and Nkhota-Kota.

Это объясняется, кроме прочего, необходимостью имплементации обще- признанных стандартов осуществления правосудия в национальную систему пра- ва, которая не оставила в стороне произ- водство по уголовным делам в отношении несовершеннолетних [1]. Представляется, что наиболее значи- мым с точки зрения реализации базового права лица, привлекаемого к уголовной ответственности, является право на ква- лифицированную юридическую помощь, которое в нашем случае трансформирует- ся в обязанность следователя, дознавателя обеспечить участие защитника во всех случаях производства предварительного расследования в отношении несовершен- нолетнего (п. 2 ч. 1 ст. 51 УПК РФ). В этой связи, в специальной литературе дискутируется возможность привлечения в качестве защитника не только адвоката, но и иного лица. Так, часть процессуали- стов категорически возражает против наличия даже потенциальной возможно- сти привлечения непрофессионального защитника для оказания юридической помощи несовершеннолетнему как наря- ду с адвокатом, так и вместо него в про- изводстве у мирового судьи [2, c. 59]. Ещё более категоричным является утвержде- ние о необходимости учёта специализа- ции адвоката при его допуске в уголов- ный процесс в качестве защитника несо- вершеннолетнего [3, c. 26]. Иной подход обосновывается тезисом о том, что каче- ство оказываемой помощи зависит не от профессиональной принадлежности лица, а от его знаний, умений и практических навыков [4, c. 75]. Полагаем, что при ре- шении поставленного вопроса необходи- мо отталкиваться от того факта, что зако- нодатель указывает на адвоката как един- ственно возможного защитника на этапе досудебного производства, что дополни- тельно подчёркивается как применитель- но к несовершеннолетним, так и к иным обвиняемым, подозреваемым в п. 10 По- становления Пленума Верховного Суда РФ от 30 июня 2015 г. № 29 [5], а также неоднократно констатировано Конститу- ционным Судом РФ, позиция которого заключается в том, что оказание неквали- фицированной юридической помощи противоречит задачам правосудия и обя- занности государства обеспечить право- вую поддержку лицу, привлекаемому к уголовной ответственности, независимо от его возраста, социального и имуще- ственного положения, а также иных кри- териев [6]. Анализ правоприменительной практики позволяет утверждать, что в це- лом право на защиту предоставляется несовершеннолетнему обвиняемому (по- дозреваемому) в надлежащем объёме, и его реализация гарантируется следовате- лем, дознавателем. По изученным мате- риалам уголовных дел во всех случаях защитник допускался в уголовный про- цесс в соответствии с требованиями ч. 3 ст. 49 УПК РФ с момента: вынесения по- становления о привлечении несовершен- нолетнего в качестве обвиняемого либо возбуждения в отношении него уголовно- го дела; его фактического задержания в качестве подозреваемого; начала осу- ществления иных мер процессуального принуждения или иных процессуальных действий, затрагивающих права и свободы несовершеннолетнего, включая случаи про- ведения проверки сообщения о преступле- нии, то есть фактически до придания несо- вершеннолетнему процессуального статуса подозреваемого, обвиняемого. Наиболее значимой формой оказания несовершеннолетнему квалифицирован- ной юридической помощи является уча- стие адвоката-защитника в производстве следственных действий. Изучение 43 ма- териалов уголовных дел показало, что та- ковыми являются преимущественно до- просы несовершеннолетних подозревае- мых, обвиняемых, а также очные ставки, опознания и проверки показаний на ме- сте. В ходе производства указанных след- ственных действий защитники реагирова- ли на нарушения прав подозреваемых, отводили вопросы следователя, которые, по их мнению, могли ухудшить процессу- альную позицию подзащитного, а также оказывали на него эмоциональное и пси- хическое воздействие, что нашло отраже- ние в протоколах производства след- ственных действий. Следует также отметить, что законо- датель существенным образом расширил возможности стороны защиты по участию в доказывании, указав на обязательность удовлетворения соответствующих хода- тайств о приобщении к материалам уго- ловного дела предметов и документов, которые имеют доказательственное зна- чение, а также заключений специалистов, полученных в ходе исследований, иници- ированных стороной защиты (ч. 2.2 ст. 159 УПК РФ). Дополнительной гарантией защиты интересов несовершеннолетнего является участие в уголовном процессе его закон- ного представителя, в качестве которого в соответствии с п. 12 ст. 5 УПК РФ при- влекаются родители, усыновители, опе- куны или попечители несовершеннолет- него подозреваемого, обвиняемого, пред- ставители учреждений или организаций, на попечении которых он находится, ор- ганы опеки и попечительства. Участие названных лиц в производстве по уголов- ному делу в данном случае является им- перативным предписанием законодателя и не зависит от волеизъявления как долж- ностного лица, ведущего предварительное расследование, так и самого несовершен- нолетнего обвиняемого, подозреваемого. Тем не менее в соответствии с ч. 4 ст. 426 УПК РФ должностному лицу предостав- лено право отстранить законного пред- ставителя от участия в уголовном деле, если имеются основания полагать, что его действия наносят ущерб интересам несо- вершеннолетнего подозреваемого, обви- няемого. В этом случае к участию в уго- ловном деле допускается другой закон- ный представитель несовершеннолетнего подозреваемого, обвиняемого, что актуа- лизирует вопрос о перечне таковых, по- скольку сопоставление положений ч. 1 ст. 437 УПК РФ (привлечение законных представителей к производству о приме- нении принудительных мер медицинского характера) и ст. 48 УПК РФ позволяет констатировать несовпадение соответ- ствующих перечней. В первом случае он шире, поскольку в качестве законных представителей допускаются близкие родственники, в число которых входят супруг, супруга, родители, дети, усыно- вители, усыновленные, родные братья и родные сестры, дедушка, бабушка, внуки (п. 3 ст. 5 УПК РФ). Следовательно, исхо- дя из положений ст. 437 УПК РФ, в число законных представителей несовершенно- летнего обвиняемого, подозреваемого входят родные братья и сестры, дедушка и бабушка. Возникает вопрос: кого следу- ет привлекать в качестве законного пред- ставителя при реализации положений ч. 4 ст. 426 УПК РФ? Следуя буквальному толкованию закона, можно констатиро- вать, что в соответствии с п. 12 ст. 5 УПК РФ привлекать следует орган опеки и по- печительства, однако, по справедливому замечанию Г.Н. Смирновой, это идёт вразрез с интересами несовершеннолетнего, поскольку представители публичных орга- нов безразличны к его судьбе, в отличие от близких родственников [3, c. 28]. О справед- ливости данного тезиса свидетельствует и эмпирический анализ. Так, из 43 материа- лов уголовных дел в 8 случаях представи- тели органа опеки и попечительства были привлечены в качестве законных предста- вителей несовершеннолетнего и в 3 из них заявили ходатайства о рассмотрении уголовного дела в судебном заседании без их участия. В специальной литературе по данному вопросу нет единства мнений. Так, например, Р.И. Зайнуллин указывает на необходимость решения вопроса о представительстве при помощи семейно- го соглашения, а при невозможности та- кового выбор законного представителя должен быть предоставлен самому несо- вершеннолетнему обвиняемому, подозре- ваемому [7, c. 4]. Аналогичной точки зре- ния придерживается и А.А. Андрейкин, указывая применительно к несовершенно- летнему потерпевшему, что его заинтересо- ванность в исходе уголовного дела позволя- ет наиболее эффективно решить вопрос о законном представителе [8, c. 44]. Полагаем, что в данном случае справедливы и доводы тех процессуалистов, которые указывают на этические пороки подобного подхода, когда подросток легально вынужден де- лать выбор, например, между отцом и ма- терью, в то время как во главу угла необ- ходимо ставить не личные отношения, а эффективность деятельности по защите интересов несовершеннолетнего [9, c. 49]. Думается, что при решении данного во- проса необходимо исходить из следую- щего. Во-первых, законный представи- тель в условиях обязательного участия защитника оказывает несовершеннолет- нему не юридическую, а, скорее, мораль- но-психологическую помощь, что пред- полагает наличие между ними неких до- верительных отношений. Во-вторых, он обязан действовать в интересах несовер- шеннолетнего, о чём с очевидностью сви- детельствуют приведённые выше поло- жения ч. 4 ст. 426 УПК РФ. В-третьих, законный представитель наделён широ- ким комплексом прав, который совместно с правами, предоставляемыми защитнику, позволяет оптимальным образом гаранти- ровать защиту интересов несовершенно- летнего. В этой связи представляется, что если будет установлено наличие благопо- лучных условий жизни и воспитания несовершеннолетнего, что является со- ставным элементом предмета доказыва- ния, то право выбора законного предста- вителя должно быть предоставлено семье с учётом мнения подростка. Если же си- туация обратная, то выбор законного представителя должен оставаться в ком- петенции следователя, который собирает информацию о внутрисемейных отноше- ниях не только от заинтересованных лиц, но и от соседей, педагогов, инспекторов по делам несовершеннолетних и т.д. В этой связи полагаем, что перечень лиц, которые могут быть законными представителями несовершеннолетнего обвиняемого, подозреваемого, необходи- мо расширить, включив в него, помимо лиц, указанных в п. 12 ст. 5 УПК РФ: – иных, кроме родителей, близких род- ственников несовершеннолетнего (родных братьев и родных сестер, дедушку, бабушку); – близких лиц несовершеннолетнего, здоровье и благополучие которого дороги им, в силу сложившихся личных отношений. В соответствии с ч. 2 ст. 426 УПК РФ в досудебном производстве законный представитель обвиняемого, подозревае- мого наделяется определёнными правами: знать, в чём подозревается или обвиняет- ся несовершеннолетний; присутствовать при предъявлении обвинения; участво- вать в допросе несовершеннолетнего по- дозреваемого, обвиняемого, а также с разрешения следователя – в иных след- ственных действиях, производимых с его участием и участием защитника; знако- миться с протоколами следственных дей- ствий, в которых он принимал участие, и делать письменные замечания о правиль- ности и полноте сделанных в них записей; заявлять ходатайства и отводы, приносить жалобы на действия (бездействие) и ре- шения дознавателя, следователя, проку- рора; представлять доказательства; по окончании предварительного расследова- ния знакомиться со всеми материалами уголовного дела, выписывать из него лю- бые сведения и в любом объёме. Анализ совокупности норм уголовно- процессуального закона, регламентиру- ющих особенности производства предва- рительного расследования по уголовным делам в отношении несовершеннолетних, позволяет констатировать наличие опре- делённых сложностей в реализации неко- торых из названных прав законного пред- ставителя. Так, не вызывает сомнений обоснованность наличия права знать о сущности предъявленного несовершенно- летнему обвинения либо подозрения. Од- нако механизм его реализации законом фактически не предусмотрен. Так, в дей- ствующей редакции ч. 1 ст. 426 УПК РФ законный представитель может быть до- пущен в процесс только с момента перво- го допроса несовершеннолетнего в каче- стве подозреваемого или обвиняемого, тогда же ему и разъясняются приведён- ные выше права. Соответственно о сущ- ности подозрения или обвинения закон- ный представитель может узнать уже в ходе производства допроса, но никак не раньше. Аналогичные проблемы возни- кают и при реализации права законного представителя присутствовать при предъ- явлении обвинения, поскольку первый допрос несовершеннолетнего в качестве обвиняемого следует за процедурой предъявления обвинения, а не предше- ствует ей. Полагаем, что указанные про- тиворечия были бы сняты при изменении момента допуска законного представите- ля к участию в производстве по уголов- ному делу. На наш взгляд, таковой дол- жен быть зависим не от производства следственного действия, а от придания несовершеннолетнему процессуального статуса подозреваемого или обвиняемого, что позволяет провести аналогию с до- пуском в уголовный процесс защитника при наличии у названных субъектов идентичной функции, выполняемой в разных формах, – защиты законных прав и интересов несовершеннолетнего. В этой связи предлагаем изложить ч. 1 ст. 426 УПК РФ в следующей редакции: «Закон- ные представители несовершеннолетнего подозреваемого, обвиняемого допускают- ся к участию в уголовном деле на основа- нии постановления следователя, дознава- теля с момента вынесения постановления о привлечении несовершеннолетнего в качестве обвиняемого либо с момента наделения его статусом подозреваемого в соответствии с положениями части 1 ста- тьи 46 настоящего Кодекса. При допуске к участию в уголовном деле им разъяс- няются права, предусмотренные частью второй настоящей статьи». Возрастные особенности подозревае- мых, обвиняемых в рассматриваемых случаях требуют использования специ- альных познаний, что реализуется по- средством привлечения педагога или пси- холога к допросу несовершеннолетнего. В соответствии с п. 9 Постановления Пле- нума Верховного Суда РФ указанные ли- ца в обязательном порядке привлекаются к производству допроса несовершенно- летнего в возрасте от 14 до 16 лет, а в возрасте от 16 до 18 лет – при условии, что он страдает психическим расстрой- ством или отстаёт в психическом разви- тии [10]. Процессуальным последствием неисполнения предписания ст. 425 УПК РФ является отсутствие доказательствен- ного значения показаний, полученных у несовершеннолетнего (ч. 2 ст. 75 УПК РФ). Говоря об участии педагога и психо- лога в производстве допроса несовершен- нолетнего, нельзя обойти вниманием не- определённость процессуального статуса указанных лиц. Следуя логике законода- теля, можно предположить, что они вво- дятся в уголовный процесс в качестве специалистов и соответственно обладают всей совокупностью прав и обязанностей, предусмотренных ст. 58 УПК РФ. Однако в соответствии с ч. 5 ст. 425 УПК РФ пе- дагог и психолог наделены ограниченным количеством прав, связанных непосред- ственно с производством допроса: с раз- решения следователя, дознавателя зада- вать вопросы несовершеннолетнему по- дозреваемому, обвиняемому; по оконча- нии допроса знакомиться с протоколом допроса и делать письменные замечания о правильности и полноте сделанных в нём записей. За пределами процессуального статуса названных лиц остаются такие права специалиста, как право отказаться от участия в производстве по уголовному делу, если он не обладает соответствую- щими специальными знаниями; прино- сить жалобы на действия (бездействие) и решения дознавателя, начальника подраз- деления дознания, начальника органа до- знания, органа дознания, следователя, прокурора и суда, ограничивающие его права (ч. 3 ст. 58 УПК РФ). Полагаем, что процессуальное положение педагога и психолога нуждается в совершенствова- нии не только с точки зрения общей логи- ки конструирования статуса лиц, содей- ствующих производству по уголовному делу, но и с позиций наметившейся тен- денции к расширению пределов их уча- стия в производстве по уголовным делам в отношении несовершеннолетних. Такое участие носит характер пилотного проек- та и характеризуется сопровождением уголовного дела с момента его возбужде- ния и до проведения реабилитационных мероприятий [11]. В этой связи предлага- ем изложить ч. 5 ст. 425 УПК РФ в сле- дующей редакции: «Педагог и (или) пси- холог в ходе производства допроса несо- вершеннолетнего реализуют права, предусмотренные частью 3 статьи 58 настоящего Кодекса». Специфика предва- рительного расследования при вовлече- нии в судопроизводство несовершенно- летнего предполагает особый режим про- изводства следственных действий. Это касается не только несовершеннолетних обвиняемых, подозреваемых, но и потер- певших и свидетелей. Равенство прав сторон, декларируемое в качестве состав- ного элемента принципа состязательности (ч. 4 ст. 15 УПК РФ), на наш взгляд, предполагает, равенство процессуальных гарантий, предоставляемых всем несо- вершеннолетним, независимо от их фак- тического процессуального статуса. Сравнительный анализ положений ст. 191 УПК РФ и ст. 425 УПК РФ позволяет вы- делить общие гарантии прав и законных ин- тересов несовершеннолетних потерпевших, свидетелей, подозреваемых и обвиняемых при производстве допроса, а именно: – ограничение продолжительности названного следственного действия для возрастной группы от 14 до 18 лет 2 ча- сами без перерыва и общей длительно- стью в течение дня не более 4 часов; – участие педагога и психолога, кото- рое в названных выше случаях является обязательным; – наличие у законного представителя права присутствовать при производстве следственного действия с участием несо- вершеннолетнего. Вместе с тем имеются и существен- ные, на наш взгляд, отличия, которые не оправданы наличием у несовершеннолет- него статуса обвиняемого (подозреваемо- го). Так, если несовершеннолетний явля- ется потерпевшим и свидетелем, то осо- бый режим производства следственных действий распространяется не только на допрос, но и на иные вербальные дей- ствия – очную ставку, опознание и про- верку показаний. Для подозреваемого, обвиняемого речь в ст. 425 УПК РФ идёт только о производстве допроса. Кроме того, в соответствии с ч. 5 ст. 191 УПК РФ в ходе производства следственных действий с участием несовершеннолетне- го потерпевшего или свидетеля обяза- тельно применение видеозаписи или ки- носъемки, материалы которых хранятся при уголовном деле. Исключение состав- ляют случаи, когда несовершеннолетний потерпевший или свидетель либо его за- конный представитель против этого воз- ражают. Полагаем, что подобный подход законодателя позволяет суду более эф- фективно оценить допустимость резуль- татов названных следственных действий, в том числе и с позиций соблюдения прав и законных интересов несовершеннолет- него. В этой связи было бы целесообразно распространить положения ч. 5 ст. 191 УПК РФ и на производство допроса, оч- ной ставки, опознания и проверки показа- ний, проводимых с участием несовер- шеннолетнего подозреваемого, обвиняе- мого. Предлагаем скорректировать ч. 6 ст. 425 УПК РФ следующим образом: «Порядок, установленный настоящей ста- тьей, а также частью 5 статьи 191 насто- ящего Кодекса распространяется и на проведение очной ставки, опознания, проверки показаний несовершеннолетне- го обвиняемого, подозреваемого, подсу- димого». И наконец, самостоятельной проблемой производства предварительно- го расследования является применение к несовершеннолетним мер процессуально- го принуждения. Положения ст. 423 УПК РФ не содержат специальных правил, обособляющих данную категорию обви- няемых, подозреваемых, указывая лишь на тот факт, что при решении вопроса об избрании меры пресечения к несовер- шеннолетнему подозреваемому, обвиняе- мому в каждом случае должна обсуж- даться возможность отдачи его под при- смотр в порядке, предусмотренном ст. 105 УПК РФ. По мнению Г.П. Хими- чевой, это свидетельствует о том, что не всегда возможно «в должной мере учесть баланс между правами несовершеннолет- них и целями уголовного судопроизвод- ства» [12, c. 20], в качестве которых в данном случае выступают обеспечение нормального хода процесса путём пресе- чения и предотвращения дальнейшей про- тивоправной деятельности обвиняемого (подозреваемого), который может скрыться от дознания, следствия или суда, продол- жить преступную деятельность, воспрепят- ствовать производству по уголовному делу, а также обеспечение исполнения приговора или возможной выдачи лица. Избрание той или иной меры пресече- ния из обозначенного в законе перечня осуществляется лицом, ведущим произ- водство по уголовному делу (ч. 1 ст. 97 УПК РФ), при этом специального перечня мер, подлежащих применению к несо- вершеннолетним, в УПК РФ не содер- жится. Дифференцированный подход в данном случае обеспечивается наличием в ст. 99 УПК РФ обстоятельств, учитыва- емых при избрании меры пресечения, в числе которых тяжесть преступления, сведения о личности подозреваемого или обвиняемого, его возраст, состояние здо- ровья, семейное положение, род занятий и другие обстоятельства. Соответствую- щие особенности применительно к несо- вершеннолетним, естественно, связаны с возрастом, что предопределяет необхо- димость учёта уровня эмоциональной, духовной и интеллектуальной зрелости обвиняемого, подозреваемого. В учебной литературе неоднократно указывалось, что оценка названных обстоятельств осу- ществляется дознавателем, следователем исходя из имеющихся данных об эмоцио- нальном состоянии подростка, уровне его возбудимости, степени социализации, пове- денческих реакциях на оценку его поведе- ния окружающими и т.д. [13, c. 316–318]. Как показывает анализ правопримени- тельной практики, наиболее востребован- ными мерами пресечения, применяемыми в отношении несовершеннолетних, явля- ются подписка о невыезде и заключение под стражу [14]. На наш взгляд, это объ- ясняется наличием отлаженного механиз- ма реализации названных мер и формаль- ных критериев ограничения свободы под- ростка в рамках досудебного производ- ства. Так, заключение под стражу приме- няется при наличии следующих условий: – совершение несовершеннолетним тяж- кого или особо тяжкого преступления (ч. 2 ст. 108 УПК РФ), а в исключительных слу- чаях – преступления средней тяжести; – невозможность применения заклю- чения под стражу в отношении несовер- шеннолетнего, не достигшего 16 лет, по- дозреваемого или обвиняемого в совер- шении преступления средней тяжести впервые (ч. 6 ст. 88 УК РФ), а также в от- ношении лица, подозреваемого или обви- няемого в совершении преступления не- большой тяжести, которое совершено им в возрасте до 18 лет (п. 6 Постановления Пленума Верховного Суда РФ от 1 фев- раля 2011 г. № 1 «О судебной практике применения законодательства, регулирую- щего особенности уголовной ответственно- сти и наказания несовершеннолетних»); – необходимость изменения меры пресе- чения в виде заключения под стражу на более мягкую при выявлении у подозреваемого или обвиняемого в совершении преступления тяжёлого заболевания, препятствующего его содержанию под стражей и удостоверенного медицинским заключением, вынесенным по результатам медицинского освидетельство- вания (ч. 1.1 ст. 110 УПК РФ). Как уже было отмечено, специальной мерой пресечения, применяемой в отно- шении несовершеннолетних, является от- дача под присмотр либо родителям, опе- кунам, попечителям или другим заслужи- вающим доверия лицам, либо должност- ным лицам специализированного детско- го учреждения, в котором он находится. В обязанность названным лицам вменяется обеспечение надлежащего поведения подростка, который в соответствии с об- щими условиями применения мер пресе- чения не должен покидать постоянное или временное место жительства без раз- решения дознавателя, следователя или суда; обязан в назначенный срок являться по вызовам в органы уголовной юстиции; не должен препятствовать производству по уголовному делу. Определяющим при выборе меры пресечения, предусмотрен- ной ст. 105 УПК РФ, является наличие у родителей, усыновителей, опекунов, по- печителей или других заслуживающих доверия лиц реальной возможности обес- печить присмотр и надлежащее поведение подростка. Заметим, что, в отличие от иной специальной меры пресечения – наблюдения командования воинской ча- сти, отдача несовершеннолетнего под присмотр осуществляется без учёта его волеизъявления. Это представляется определённым пробелом в законе, по- скольку несовершеннолетний по различ- ным причинам может возражать против отдачи его под присмотр конкретного ли- ца, что не может не отразиться на его дальнейшем поведении, а также суще- ственным образом нивелирует воспита- тельный эффект от применения рассмат- риваемой меры. Представляется, что ст. 105 УПК РФ необходимо дополнить ч. 1.1 следующего содержания: «Избра- ние присмотра в качестве меры пресече- ния допускается с согласия несовершен- нолетнего подозреваемого, обвиняемого». Все перечисленные особенности досу- дебного производства по уголовным де- лам в отношении несовершеннолетних реализуются в условиях выделения уго- ловного дела в отношении него в отдель- ное производство при условии, что это не отразится на всесторонности и объектив- ности предварительного расследования и разрешения уголовного дела (ст. 154, 422 УПК РФ). Кроме того, законодатель предусматривает специальную форму окончания досудебного производства – вынесение постановления о прекращении уголовного преследования и возбуждении перед судом ходатайства о применении к несовершеннолетнему обвиняемому при- нудительной меры воспитательного воз- действия (ч. 1 ст. 427 УПК РФ). Она явля- ется альтернативой уголовному преследо- ванию и возможна при наличии двух условий: совершение несовершеннолет- ним преступления небольшой или сред- ней тяжести впервые, а также установле- ние в ходе расследования возможности исправления несовершеннолетнего обви- няемого без применения наказания.","output":"Уголовное производство в отношении несовершеннолетних включает дополнительные гарантии защиты их прав, что соответствует международным стандартам правосудия [1]. Особое внимание уделяется праву на квалифицированную юридическую помощь, что требует обеспечения участия защитника на всех этапах предварительного расследования по делам несовершеннолетних, как предписывает УПК РФ (ст. 51) [2]. Обсуждается практическое применение специалистов в роли защитника, их знания и опыт [4]. Важность адвоката с соответствующей специализацией подтверждается документами Верховного Суда РФ и Конституционного Суда РФ [5][6]. При этом, правоприменительная практика показывает, что защита обычно осуществляется адвокатами и включает участие в следственных действиях, особенно при допросах [2]. Для усиления защиты интересов несовершеннолетних важно участие их законных представителей, что закреплено УПК РФ (ст. 5 и 426) [5]. Возникшие вопросы о выборе законных представителей требуют рассмотрения с учетом мнения подростка и обстоятельств жизни несовершеннолетнего [7][8]. Предлагаются изменения в УПК РФ, предусматривающие расширение круга лиц, которые могут быть законными представителями, чтобы помимо родственников могли включаться другие лица, важные для несовершеннолетнего. Кроме того, роль педагогов и психологов при допросе следует уточнить, предоставив им более полные права специалистов по УПК РФ [10][11]. Необходим общий подход к проведению следственных действий с несовершеннолетними, обеспечивающий равенство и защиту их интересов вне зависимости от статуса, что может потребовать видеозапись следственных действий [9]. Относительно мер процессуального принуждения, ст. 423 УПК РФ не выделяет несовершеннолетних, однако ст. 105 УПК РФ ориентирует на рассмотрение отдачи молодого человека под присмотр [12]. Правоприменительная практика чаще применяет подписку о невыезде и заключение под стражу. Требуется учесть в процедуре согласие несовершеннолетнего на отдачу его под присмотр, гарантируя эффективность воспитательного воздействия [13][14]. Последнее упоминание касается возможности окончания уголовного преследования с применением воспитательных мер в отношении несовершеннолетних при наличии определенных условий, что служит альтернативой уголовному наказанию [3]."},{"instruction":"Πως υπολογιζούμε την ενεργο ισχύ σε έναν μετασχηματιστή","output":"Η ενεργός ισχύς σε έναν μετασχηματιστή μπορεί να υπολογιστεί ως το γινόμενο της τάσης και του ρεύματος που διέρχεται από τον μετασχηματιστή (P = V x I x cosθ).

Last year, the company employed around 300 people and generated sales of € 39 million with good profitability. Three years ago, Ness transformed his company into a corporation, a limited liability company (GmbH), whose shares he currently owns alone. The decision at the time was as follows: Circumstance Fritz Ness had never been particularly interested in the legal form of his company. This was neither an exciting product question for him, nor did a discussion about it bring any immediate customer benefit. And everything else was hardly a priority for him. When he founded at that time, he went to the trade office, registered his trade and obtained a trade license, entered his company in the commercial register, and off he went. Initially, Ness was not even aware of the fact that his company now had the legal form of a \\"sole proprietorship\\". Only later, in the course of the company's growth, was he also confronted with these legal questions. Quite early on, his lawyer had drawn his attention to the risk of unlimited liability, which he entered into with his legal form. \\"You stick with everything you have – including your house, your weekend house, right down to the lastlamp\\". Ness was only a bit defensive at first – \\"I have no intention of going bankrupt\\" – but quickly accepted his lawyer's argument: \\"Just think about the nutritional supplements you sell, for example. They are not even manufactured by your company. Imagine a mistake with their supplier, and customers get sick. The claims for damages will ruin you, even if you feel innocent.\\" But when Ness then told his tax advisor that his lawyer had recommended that he be converted into a limited liability company, he protested: \\"No, you still drive worse with a corporation for tax purposes. If so, we should think about a GmbH & Co. KG.\\" Later, Ness began to worry about the continued existence of his company if he, the bachelor, would no longer work for the company. His lawyer then suggested the AG to him in order to later take the company public. In order to bring structure to these thoughts and to come to a long-term sustainable solution, Ness asked his lawyer and tax advisor to come to him three years ago. Also present was Harry Netzer, who was to succeed him in the management. At that time, he was still a sole proprietor. \\"So, let's try to systematize that,\\" said Harry Netzer, after everyone involved had listed all the criteria a bit unstructured for a while. \\"What are the priorities?\\" \\"So, first of all – limitation of liability. The company is now so large that personal liability is associated with far too great a risk,\\" said Fritz Ness. \\"Well, we agree on this point. So that's a knock-out criterion. There is no possible structure that would give you unlimited liability, Mr Ness.\\" As a result, e.g., the pure limited partnership (KG) was eliminated. \\"Second,\\" Harry Netzer continued, \\"my understanding is that we need a corporate structure that ensures the continued existence of the company regardless of the person of the shareholders. \\"And thirdly, we need a design model for tax optimization,\\" the tax consultant intervened. \\"Yes, the third criterion is: save taxes, or, as your tax advisor puts it, a corresponding 'design model'.\\" The lawyer says: \\"We are looking for a model that best meets criteria two and three, under the framework of liability limitation. What alternatives do we have?\\" • \\"I propose the GmbH & Co. KG, especially from a tax point of view,\\" said the tax consultant. \\"A KG with 'Ness VerwaltungsGmbH' as personally liable partner.\\" \\"But from the point of view of the continued existence of the company rather the wrong thing,\\" replied the lawyer. \\"Of course, both the shares of Ness Verwaltungs-GmbH and the limited partnership shares can be transferred. But this is relatively cumbersome, so it will be difficult to find suitable buyers. If you, Mr Ness, which is intended, want to bring your company later on the capital market, I mean on the stock exchange, then that is a bad solution.\\" \\"Then we need an AG,\\" Ness turned on again. \\"But there is also a lot to be said against the AG?\\" • \\"Only the statutory provisions speak against the AG. The leap from a sole proprietorship to an AG is quite large. For example, we would have to establish a board of directors and a supervisory board (AR). And you, Mr. Ness, cannot, by law, be on the board and AR at the same time. So you either have to go into the AR, and thus hand over the operational business to the Executive Board; or they go to the board, but then have to appoint an AR to control you in your own company.\\" \\"Well, in fact, hardly anyone will oppose Mr. Ness\\" - \\"That may be true, Mr. Netzer, but as a lawyer I have to draw attention to it\\". • \\"And what would be the alternative?\\" \\"The alternative would be to first choose a GmbH. This is easier than the AG. Mr. Ness could also work as a managing director, & possibly other employees from the management. And a conversion from a GmbH into an AG is relatively little time-consuming.\\" \\"Well, I can't say that I like to pay more taxes than necessary. How big would be the tax advantages of GmbH & Co. KG over GmbH or AG?\\" It turned out that the differences were not very large. Question: • Which legal forms are discussed? Put together the advantages and disadvantages of these. • What advice would you give to Mr. Ness?","output":"The legal forms discussed in the passage are a limited liability company (GmbH), a partnership (GmbH & Co. KG), and a public limited company (AG). Advantages and disadvantages of each legal form: 1. Limited Liability Company (GmbH): - Advantages: - Limited liability: The owner's personal assets are protected from business liabilities. - Simplicity: Easier to establish and maintain compared to other forms like AG. - Tax flexibility: Allows for tax optimization and potential tax advantages. - Disadvantages: - Limited capital raising options: It may be more difficult to attract external investors or go public. - Limited transferability of shares: Shares in a GmbH are not freely transferable like in an AG. - Lack of prestige: AG may have more credibility and reputation in certain industries. 2. Partnership (GmbH & Co. KG): - Advantages: - Limited liability for the GmbH partner: The GmbH partner's liability is limited to the extent of their capital contribution. - Flexibility: Allows for the participation of external investors as limited partners. - Tax advantages: Potential tax benefits due to distribution of profits and losses between partners. - Disadvantages: - Complexity: More administrative duties and legal requirements compared to a GmbH. - Difficulty in finding suitable buyers: The transfer of partnership shares can be challenging. - Lack of capital market options: It may be more difficult to take the company public. 3. Public Limited Company (AG): - Advantages: - Easier access to capital markets: Can issue publicly traded shares, facilitating fundraising. - Prestige and reputation: AG may be perceived as more credible and reputable in certain industries. - Clear management structure: Separation of powers between the Board of Directors and the Supervisory Board. - Disadvantages: - Complexity: Requires the establishment of a Board of Directors and a Supervisory Board. - Limitations in decision-making: Mr. Ness cannot be on the Board and the Supervisory Board simultaneously. - Potential lack of control: The Board may not always agree with Mr. Ness's decisions. Advice for Mr. Ness: Given the circumstances and criteria mentioned, it is recommended for Mr. Ness to consider converting his company into a GmbH. This legal form provides limitations of liability, allows for tax optimization, and offers relative simplicity in its establishment and maintenance. Later, if Mr. Ness intends to go public, he can convert the GmbH into an AG. This option provides access to capital markets and can enhance the company's credibility and reputation. However, it is essential to carefully evaluate the additional complexity and requirements associated with an AG, including the establishment of a Board of Directors and a Supervisory Board."},{"instruction":"简述染色质的拓扑关联结构域，染色质环以及描述染色质环形成过程中的环挤压模型","output":"染色质的拓扑关联结构域是指染色质中的一段长度较短的DNA序列通过多种拓扑方式相互联系在一起形成的结构域。这些结构域可以在三维空间中交错和交织，形成复杂的空间结构。 染色质环是指染色质在表观遗传调控中形成的一种环状结构。染色质环中的DNA序列呈环形排列，并且被染色质环蛋白质所包围。染色质环的形成可以将基因组中相互作用的基因序列从其他区域隔离出来，从而实现基因表达的调控。 染色质环形成过程中的环挤压模型是一种关于染色质环形成的假设模型。据该模型，染色质环的形成是通过染色质中的多个DNA序列相互作用形成的。首先，DNA序列在空间中相互纠结，形成一种具有空间特殊性的互连结构。然后，此互连结构通过DNA随机缠绕以及染色质环蛋白的作用逐渐压缩成一个紧密的环状结构。在环挤压模型中，通过染色质环的形成，可以使得染色质中的基因序列在空间上更加紧密地相互关联，进而影响基因表达的发生。"},{"instruction":"生物物理中染色质的拓扑关联结构域，染色质环以及描述染色质环形成过程中的环挤压模型是什么","output":"在生物物理中，染色质的拓扑关联结构域是指染色质中一段相对较短的DNA序列，通过多种拓扑方式相互关联在一起形成的局部结构。这些结构域可以在三维空间中纠缠和交错，形成复杂的空间结构。拓扑关联结构域在调节基因表达和染色体结构方面起着重要的作用。 染色质环是指染色质中形成的环状结构，其中DNA序列以环形排列，并被染色质环蛋白所包围。染色质环的形成有助于将相互作用的基因序列从其他区域隔离出来，实现基因的空间调控。 环挤压模型是描述染色质环形成过程的模型。根据环挤压模型，染色质环的形成是由染色质中DNA序列相互作用引起的。首先，DNA序列在空间中相互纠结，形成一种特殊的空间拓扑结构。然后，通过DNA的随机缠绕和染色质环蛋白的作用，互连结构逐渐压缩成一个紧密的环状结构。通过染色质环的形成，染色质中的基因序列可以更紧密地相互关联，从而对基因表达产生影响。 总结来说，染色质的拓扑关联结构域是局部的DNA序列的空间结构，染色质环是染色质中的环状结构，而环挤压模型描述了染色质环形成的过程。"},{"instruction":"蛋白质结构预测可分为几类，其原理分别是什么，各有什么优缺点和适合何类系统？","output":"蛋白质结构预测可以分为三类：同源建模、蛋白质折叠速度预测和基于物理力学的方法。 1. 同源建模(Homology Modeling)：该方法基于已知结构的蛋白质与目标蛋白质之间的高度相似性。原理是找到一个或多个已知结构与目标蛋白质序列存在高度相似性的蛋白质，然后将已知结构的坐标映射到目标蛋白质的序列上。优点是在高度相似的情况下能够产生高质量的结构模型，缺点是对于与已知结构相似性较低的蛋白质预测效果较差。 2. 蛋白质折叠速度预测(Predictions of Protein Foldability)：该方法通过预测蛋白质折叠速度来推断其结构。原理是根据蛋白质序列的属性和相似的蛋白质结构，预测蛋白质的折叠速度和稳定性。优点是对于难以通过同源建模的蛋白质，可以提供结构预测，缺点是预测的准确性相对较低。 3. 基于物理力学的方法(Physics-based methods)：该方法基于能量最小化原理，通过模拟蛋白质的物理力学和化学性质来预测蛋白质的结构。原理是通过最小化蛋白质的能量函数，寻找在特定条件下最稳定的三维结构。优点是能够考虑到分子之间的物理相互作用，可以预测更复杂的蛋白质结构，缺点是计算复杂度高且计算时间较长。 这些方法各有优缺点和适用范围。同源建模适用于与已知结构有高度相似性的蛋白质，但对于没有相关结构的蛋白质效果较差。蛋白质折叠速度预测适用于预测蛋白质的折叠速度，在一定程度上可以推断其结构，但准确性有限。基于物理力学的方法适用于较为复杂的蛋白质结构预测，可以考虑更多的物理相互作用，但计算复杂度高且耗时较长。因此，选择预测方法时应根据具体的目标蛋白质和可用数据的情况进行选择。"},{"instruction":"蛋白质结构预测中同源建模的原理，优缺点，适合何类系统","output":"同源建模（Homology modeling）是一种基于比较蛋白质序列和已知结构的方法，预测目标蛋白质的结构。其原理包括序列比对、构建模型和模型优化。 同源建模的步骤如下： 1. 序列比对：将目标蛋白质的序列与已知结构的蛋白质序列进行比对，寻找高度相似的蛋白质作为模板。 2. 模型构建：根据模板的结构，将目标蛋白质的序列与已知结构进行对齐，然后构建起目标蛋白质的初始模型。 3. 模型优化：通过分子力学模拟或其他优化方法，对模型进行优化，使其更贴近真实结构。 同源建模的优点包括： 1. 准确性较高：当目标蛋白质与已知结构蛋白质具有高度相似性时，同源建模能够预测出高质量的结构模型。 2. 速度较快：相对于其他方法，同源建模的计算时间较短，特别是在找到合适的模板后，模型构建和优化可以很快完成。 同源建模的缺点包括： 1. 受限于已知结构的可用性：同源建模的前提是依赖于已知结构的模板，因此需要在数据库中寻找到与目标蛋白质高度相似的结构。如果目标蛋白质与已知结构蛋白质缺乏相似性，或者数据库中缺少合适的模板，同源建模的准确性就会下降。 2. 模板结构的质量：模板结构的质量对最终模型的准确性有很大影响。如果使用的模板结构存在误差或结构与目标蛋白质存在显著差异，同源建模的结果可能不准确。 同源建模适用于目标蛋白质与已知结构蛋白质具有高度相似性的情况。对于在数据库中找到高质量模板的蛋白质，同源建模可以提供准确的结构预测。此外，同源建模在预测蛋白质的结构和功能关系、蛋白质工程以及药物设计等方面也有广泛应用。"},{"instruction":"蛋白质结构预测中折叠识别法、从头预测法的原理，优缺点，适合何类系统","output":"蛋白质结构预测中，折叠识别法和从头预测法是两种常用的方法。 1. 折叠识别法（Fold Recognition）：折叠识别法基于已知结构的传统蛋白质家族库，通过比对目标蛋白质的序列与该库中已知结构的序列进行比对，寻找相似的结构模板，从而推断目标蛋白质的结构。 折叠识别法的优点包括： - 可以预测与已知结构相似的蛋白质，即使目标蛋白质与已知结构的相似性较低。 - 在传统蛋白质家族库中，已知结构的数量相对较多，可以提供大量的潜在结构模板。 折叠识别法的缺点包括： - 受限于已知结构的库：折叠识别法的准确性依赖于数据库中已知结构的质量和多样性。 - 对于与已知结构不相似的蛋白质，准确性较低。 折叠识别法适合于那些与已知结构具有一定相似性的蛋白质，特别是对于数据库中已有大量结构的蛋白质家族来说，准确性较高。 2. 从头预测法（Ab initio Prediction）：从头预测法是根据蛋白质的序列推断其结构，不依赖于已有结构的模板。它基于物理力学和统计模型，尝试找到能量最低的三维构型。 从头预测法的优点包括： - 不依赖于已有结构的模板，适用于那些与已知结构不相似或数据库中缺乏合适模板的蛋白质。 - 可以预测新的、未知的蛋白质结构。 从头预测法的缺点包括： - 计算复杂性高，需要大量的计算资源和时间。 - 准确性有限，特别是对于大、复杂的蛋白质结构，预测往往不够准确。 从头预测法适用于那些与已知结构不相似、或者是未知蛋白质序列的新蛋白质结构预测，但其准确性和适用范围受到计算资源和算法的限制。"},{"instruction":"证明肌动蛋白丝自组装时单体浓度存在临界值","output":"肌动蛋白丝自组装是指肌动蛋白单体在适当的条件下，通过自身相互作用，形成一个长链状的肌动蛋白丝结构。在这个过程中，存在单体浓度的临界值，即低于这个临界值时，肌动蛋白单体无法自组装为丝状结构。 这个临界值的存在可以通过下面的推理过程来证明： 1. 肌动蛋白自组装的过程是一个动态平衡过程。在自组装过程中，肌动蛋白单体可以发生结合和解离的反应。当结合反应速率等于解离反应速率时，系统达到动态平衡。 2. 结合反应速率与肌动蛋白单体的浓度相关。在低浓度下，单体之间的相互作用相对较少，结合反应速率较低。而在高浓度下，单体之间的相互作用更频繁，结合反应速率较高。 3. 当单体浓度低于某个临界值时，结合反应速率始终较低，无法与解离反应速率达到平衡。这意味着单体结合的速度远远低于解离的速度，丝状结构无法形成。 4. 当单体浓度超过临界值时，结合反应速率与解离反应速率之间产生平衡，使丝状结构得以形成。 因此，通过上述推理过程可证明肌动蛋白丝自组装时存在单体浓度的临界值。低于这个临界值时，肌动蛋白单体无法形成稳定的丝状结构。"},{"instruction":"幫我寫一個英文電郵範本，關於同大家講我放假","output":"Subject: Vacation Notification Dear [Team/Colleagues], I hope this email finds you all well.

Especially in the field of signal detection, higher performance requirements are needed, including larger swelling ratios and better mechanical strength. Traditional bulk hydrogels have a highly cross-linked network structure, enabling them to have better mechanical properties and larger swelling volumes. However, they have lower swelling rates. On the other hand, porous hydrogels contain open channels, allowing them to swell rapidly and achieve maximum swelling volume in a short period of time. The drawback is that their swelling volume is smaller. Therefore, finding a balance between these two types of hydrogels is urgently needed to broaden their applications. In this regard, we draw inspiration from the natural pufferfish. When stimulated, pufferfish can rapidly intake water or air, causing their bodies to quickly expand, even several times their original size. They also possess excellent mechanical strength, as they are not easily burst under significant force or fast solvent absorption. Inspired by pufferfish, we apply this concept to hydrogels and aim to develop a hydrogel that exhibits rapid expansion and a high swelling ratio. In this work, we utilize a simple self-assembly method inspired by pufferfish to prepare pufferfish-inspired hydrogels with high swelling rates and large swelling ratios. These hydrogels possess good mechanical strength and are applied in temperature detection in pigs, with the envisioned utilization in human body detection, particularly rapid expansion in the human stomach.

Хотел купить по рекламе Дастер со скидкой, а нет, кружить сразу начали, на первый взнос разводить. Тогда привезут, а сами договор под нос — я читать то умею. Не привезут если, там написано, не их забота. Денег не вернут. Говорю, бывает, что не привозите-то? Глазки забегали. Я психологию и всякую там мимику скрытую никогда со счетов не скидываю, иной раз больше скажут, чем слова, да и сам осмотрелся получше, а машины некоторые, их кстати не много в самом салоне, не новые. Попросил для интереса показать одну, потом говорю, вернемся к договору, я может из того что есть выберу. Показали. Восстановленная, пробег нулевой, новая, спрашиваю? Да. До свидания. Все понятно с ними.","output":"1. Прошу вас учесть мой опыт при покупке автомобиля в салоне Авангард Краснодар. Мое ощущение от него можно описать одним словом - разочарование. Обещанная скидка на автомобиль Дастер оказалась всего лишь маневром для привлечения клиентов. С первого же взноса начали пытаться меня развести, а договор привезли только когда я сам настоял на его прочтении. В нем же прописано, что в случае неисполнения обязательств со стороны салона, мне деньги не вернут. Причем, они очень гибко интерпретируют свои обязанности и в итоге ничего не дают конкретных ответов. Машин в салоне действительно не много, и часть из них оказывается подержанными, что меня немного ошарашило. 2. Слышал много хвалебных отзывов о салоне Авангард Краснодар, но решил сам убедиться. Отзываюсь о своем опыте, чтобы другие не совершили мою ошибку. Во-первых, скидка на Дастер оказалась просто обманом - изначальная цена машины была преувеличена, чтобы сэкономить на скидке. Во-вторых, я оставил первоначальный взнос, а мне не привезли автомобиль! Причем, они упорно игнорировали мои звонки и сообщения. Когда наконец договорились о встрече, оказалось, что машина, которую они показали, была восстановленной. Я не стал продолжать сделку с такими недобросовестными людьми и ушел. 3. Мое посещение салона Авангард Краснодар оставило горькое послевкусие. Во-первых, менеджеры обладают искусным мастерством обмана - они говорят одно, а делают совершенно другое. Обещанная скидка на автомобиль Дастер оказалась пустой звук, а когда я решил отказаться от сделки, они уверили меня, что мне не вернут уже внесенный взнос. Во-вторых, машины в самом салоне оказались не новыми, а подержанными. Видимо, они рассчитывали на то, что я этого не замечу. К счастью, я быстро сообразил и ушел от них, не позволив себя обмануть. 4. Хочется поделиться своей неприятной встречей с салоном Авангард Краснодар. Поверил рекламе и положительным отзывам, но как только зашел в салон, понял, что попал в ловушку. Вместо обещанного автомобиля Дастер со скидкой, меня пытались втюхать подержанную машину с пробегом. И когда я стал спрашивать о договоре, менеджеры стали мастера уводить разговор в сторону. Такой подход вызывает только недоверие и разочарование. Решил не рисковать и вовремя покинуть салон. 5. Определенно, салон Авангард Краснодар - это не место, где стоит приобретать автомобиль. Мой опыт покупки там был ужасным. Во-первых, менеджеры не имеют никаких принципов и готовы делать все, чтобы продать вам что-то подешевле и подкрасться к вашим деньгам. Я надеялся приобрести нормальный автомобиль Дастер со скидкой, но неудачно. Оказалось, что все скидки лишь наружу, а внутри вас ждет старый, битый автомобиль. К счастью, я провел небольшой анализ и решил не рисковать, а отказаться от покупки."},{"instruction":"živjo","output":"Pozdravljeni!

Это объясняется, кроме прочего, необходимостью имплементации обще- признанных стандартов осуществления правосудия в национальную систему пра- ва, которая не оставила в стороне произ- водство по уголовным делам в отношении несовершеннолетних [1]. Представляется, что наиболее значи- мым с точки зрения реализации базового права лица, привлекаемого к уголовной ответственности, является право на ква- лифицированную юридическую помощь, которое в нашем случае трансформирует- ся в обязанность следователя, дознавателя обеспечить участие защитника во всех случаях производства предварительного расследования в отношении несовершен- нолетнего (п. 2 ч. 1 ст. 51 УПК РФ). В этой связи, в специальной литературе дискутируется возможность привлечения в качестве защитника не только адвоката, но и иного лица. Так, часть процессуали- стов категорически возражает против наличия даже потенциальной возможно- сти привлечения непрофессионального защитника для оказания юридической помощи несовершеннолетнему как наря- ду с адвокатом, так и вместо него в про- изводстве у мирового судьи [2, c. 59]. Ещё более категоричным является утвержде- ние о необходимости учёта специализа- ции адвоката при его допуске в уголов- ный процесс в качестве защитника несо- вершеннолетнего [3, c. 26]. Иной подход обосновывается тезисом о том, что каче- ство оказываемой помощи зависит не от профессиональной принадлежности лица, а от его знаний, умений и практических навыков [4, c. 75]. Полагаем, что при ре- шении поставленного вопроса необходи- мо отталкиваться от того факта, что зако- нодатель указывает на адвоката как един- ственно возможного защитника на этапе досудебного производства, что дополни- тельно подчёркивается как применитель- но к несовершеннолетним, так и к иным обвиняемым, подозреваемым в п. 10 По- становления Пленума Верховного Суда РФ от 30 июня 2015 г. № 29 [5], а также неоднократно констатировано Конститу- ционным Судом РФ, позиция которого заключается в том, что оказание неквали- фицированной юридической помощи противоречит задачам правосудия и обя- занности государства обеспечить право- вую поддержку лицу, привлекаемому к уголовной ответственности, независимо от его возраста, социального и имуще- ственного положения, а также иных кри- териев [6]. Анализ правоприменительной практики позволяет утверждать, что в це- лом право на защиту предоставляется несовершеннолетнему обвиняемому (по- дозреваемому) в надлежащем объёме, и его реализация гарантируется следовате- лем, дознавателем. По изученным мате- риалам уголовных дел во всех случаях защитник допускался в уголовный про- цесс в соответствии с требованиями ч. 3 ст. 49 УПК РФ с момента: вынесения по- становления о привлечении несовершен- нолетнего в качестве обвиняемого либо возбуждения в отношении него уголовно- го дела; его фактического задержания в качестве подозреваемого; начала осу- ществления иных мер процессуального принуждения или иных процессуальных действий, затрагивающих права и свободы несовершеннолетнего, включая случаи про- ведения проверки сообщения о преступле- нии, то есть фактически до придания несо- вершеннолетнему процессуального статуса подозреваемого, обвиняемого. Наиболее значимой формой оказания несовершеннолетнему квалифицирован- ной юридической помощи является уча- стие адвоката-защитника в производстве следственных действий. Изучение 43 ма- териалов уголовных дел показало, что та- ковыми являются преимущественно до- просы несовершеннолетних подозревае- мых, обвиняемых, а также очные ставки, опознания и проверки показаний на ме- сте. В ходе производства указанных след- ственных действий защитники реагирова- ли на нарушения прав подозреваемых, отводили вопросы следователя, которые, по их мнению, могли ухудшить процессу- альную позицию подзащитного, а также оказывали на него эмоциональное и пси- хическое воздействие, что нашло отраже- ние в протоколах производства след- ственных действий. Следует также отметить, что законо- датель существенным образом расширил возможности стороны защиты по участию в доказывании, указав на обязательность удовлетворения соответствующих хода- тайств о приобщении к материалам уго- ловного дела предметов и документов, которые имеют доказательственное зна- чение, а также заключений специалистов, полученных в ходе исследований, иници- ированных стороной защиты (ч. 2.2 ст. 159 УПК РФ). Дополнительной гарантией защиты интересов несовершеннолетнего является участие в уголовном процессе его закон- ного представителя, в качестве которого в соответствии с п. 12 ст. 5 УПК РФ при- влекаются родители, усыновители, опе- куны или попечители несовершеннолет- него подозреваемого, обвиняемого, пред- ставители учреждений или организаций, на попечении которых он находится, ор- ганы опеки и попечительства. Участие названных лиц в производстве по уголов- ному делу в данном случае является им- перативным предписанием законодателя и не зависит от волеизъявления как долж- ностного лица, ведущего предварительное расследование, так и самого несовершен- нолетнего обвиняемого, подозреваемого. Тем не менее в соответствии с ч. 4 ст. 426 УПК РФ должностному лицу предостав- лено право отстранить законного пред- ставителя от участия в уголовном деле, если имеются основания полагать, что его действия наносят ущерб интересам несо- вершеннолетнего подозреваемого, обви- няемого. В этом случае к участию в уго- ловном деле допускается другой закон- ный представитель несовершеннолетнего подозреваемого, обвиняемого, что актуа- лизирует вопрос о перечне таковых, по- скольку сопоставление положений ч. 1 ст. 437 УПК РФ (привлечение законных представителей к производству о приме- нении принудительных мер медицинского характера) и ст. 48 УПК РФ позволяет констатировать несовпадение соответ- ствующих перечней. В первом случае он шире, поскольку в качестве законных представителей допускаются близкие родственники, в число которых входят супруг, супруга, родители, дети, усыно- вители, усыновленные, родные братья и родные сестры, дедушка, бабушка, внуки (п. 3 ст. 5 УПК РФ). Следовательно, исхо- дя из положений ст. 437 УПК РФ, в число законных представителей несовершенно- летнего обвиняемого, подозреваемого входят родные братья и сестры, дедушка и бабушка. Возникает вопрос: кого следу- ет привлекать в качестве законного пред- ставителя при реализации положений ч. 4 ст. 426 УПК РФ? Следуя буквальному толкованию закона, можно констатиро- вать, что в соответствии с п. 12 ст. 5 УПК РФ привлекать следует орган опеки и по- печительства, однако, по справедливому замечанию Г.Н. Смирновой, это идёт вразрез с интересами несовершеннолетнего, поскольку представители публичных орга- нов безразличны к его судьбе, в отличие от близких родственников [3, c. 28]. О справед- ливости данного тезиса свидетельствует и эмпирический анализ. Так, из 43 материа- лов уголовных дел в 8 случаях представи- тели органа опеки и попечительства были привлечены в качестве законных предста- вителей несовершеннолетнего и в 3 из них заявили ходатайства о рассмотрении уголовного дела в судебном заседании без их участия. В специальной литературе по данному вопросу нет единства мнений. Так, например, Р.И. Зайнуллин указывает на необходимость решения вопроса о представительстве при помощи семейно- го соглашения, а при невозможности та- кового выбор законного представителя должен быть предоставлен самому несо- вершеннолетнему обвиняемому, подозре- ваемому [7, c. 4]. Аналогичной точки зре- ния придерживается и А.А. Андрейкин, указывая применительно к несовершенно- летнему потерпевшему, что его заинтересо- ванность в исходе уголовного дела позволя- ет наиболее эффективно решить вопрос о законном представителе [8, c. 44]. Полагаем, что в данном случае справедливы и доводы тех процессуалистов, которые указывают на этические пороки подобного подхода, когда подросток легально вынужден де- лать выбор, например, между отцом и ма- терью, в то время как во главу угла необ- ходимо ставить не личные отношения, а эффективность деятельности по защите интересов несовершеннолетнего [9, c. 49]. Думается, что при решении данного во- проса необходимо исходить из следую- щего. Во-первых, законный представи- тель в условиях обязательного участия защитника оказывает несовершеннолет- нему не юридическую, а, скорее, мораль- но-психологическую помощь, что пред- полагает наличие между ними неких до- верительных отношений. Во-вторых, он обязан действовать в интересах несовер- шеннолетнего, о чём с очевидностью сви- детельствуют приведённые выше поло- жения ч. 4 ст. 426 УПК РФ. В-третьих, законный представитель наделён широ- ким комплексом прав, который совместно с правами, предоставляемыми защитнику, позволяет оптимальным образом гаранти- ровать защиту интересов несовершенно- летнего. В этой связи представляется, что если будет установлено наличие благопо- лучных условий жизни и воспитания несовершеннолетнего, что является со- ставным элементом предмета доказыва- ния, то право выбора законного предста- вителя должно быть предоставлено семье с учётом мнения подростка. Если же си- туация обратная, то выбор законного представителя должен оставаться в ком- петенции следователя, который собирает информацию о внутрисемейных отноше- ниях не только от заинтересованных лиц, но и от соседей, педагогов, инспекторов по делам несовершеннолетних и т.д. В этой связи полагаем, что перечень лиц, которые могут быть законными представителями несовершеннолетнего обвиняемого, подозреваемого, необходи- мо расширить, включив в него, помимо лиц, указанных в п. 12 ст. 5 УПК РФ: – иных, кроме родителей, близких род- ственников несовершеннолетнего (родных братьев и родных сестер, дедушку, бабушку); – близких лиц несовершеннолетнего, здоровье и благополучие которого дороги им, в силу сложившихся личных отношений. В соответствии с ч. 2 ст. 426 УПК РФ в досудебном производстве законный представитель обвиняемого, подозревае- мого наделяется определёнными правами: знать, в чём подозревается или обвиняет- ся несовершеннолетний; присутствовать при предъявлении обвинения; участво- вать в допросе несовершеннолетнего по- дозреваемого, обвиняемого, а также с разрешения следователя – в иных след- ственных действиях, производимых с его участием и участием защитника; знако- миться с протоколами следственных дей- ствий, в которых он принимал участие, и делать письменные замечания о правиль- ности и полноте сделанных в них записей; заявлять ходатайства и отводы, приносить жалобы на действия (бездействие) и ре- шения дознавателя, следователя, проку- рора; представлять доказательства; по окончании предварительного расследова- ния знакомиться со всеми материалами уголовного дела, выписывать из него лю- бые сведения и в любом объёме. Анализ совокупности норм уголовно- процессуального закона, регламентиру- ющих особенности производства предва- рительного расследования по уголовным делам в отношении несовершеннолетних, позволяет констатировать наличие опре- делённых сложностей в реализации неко- торых из названных прав законного пред- ставителя. Так, не вызывает сомнений обоснованность наличия права знать о сущности предъявленного несовершенно- летнему обвинения либо подозрения. Од- нако механизм его реализации законом фактически не предусмотрен. Так, в дей- ствующей редакции ч. 1 ст. 426 УПК РФ законный представитель может быть до- пущен в процесс только с момента перво- го допроса несовершеннолетнего в каче- стве подозреваемого или обвиняемого, тогда же ему и разъясняются приведён- ные выше права. Соответственно о сущ- ности подозрения или обвинения закон- ный представитель может узнать уже в ходе производства допроса, но никак не раньше. Аналогичные проблемы возни- кают и при реализации права законного представителя присутствовать при предъ- явлении обвинения, поскольку первый допрос несовершеннолетнего в качестве обвиняемого следует за процедурой предъявления обвинения, а не предше- ствует ей. Полагаем, что указанные про- тиворечия были бы сняты при изменении момента допуска законного представите- ля к участию в производстве по уголов- ному делу. На наш взгляд, таковой дол- жен быть зависим не от производства следственного действия, а от придания несовершеннолетнему процессуального статуса подозреваемого или обвиняемого, что позволяет провести аналогию с до- пуском в уголовный процесс защитника при наличии у названных субъектов идентичной функции, выполняемой в разных формах, – защиты законных прав и интересов несовершеннолетнего. В этой связи предлагаем изложить ч. 1 ст. 426 УПК РФ в следующей редакции: «Закон- ные представители несовершеннолетнего подозреваемого, обвиняемого допускают- ся к участию в уголовном деле на основа- нии постановления следователя, дознава- теля с момента вынесения постановления о привлечении несовершеннолетнего в качестве обвиняемого либо с момента наделения его статусом подозреваемого в соответствии с положениями части 1 ста- тьи 46 настоящего Кодекса. При допуске к участию в уголовном деле им разъяс- няются права, предусмотренные частью второй настоящей статьи». Возрастные особенности подозревае- мых, обвиняемых в рассматриваемых случаях требуют использования специ- альных познаний, что реализуется по- средством привлечения педагога или пси- холога к допросу несовершеннолетнего. В соответствии с п. 9 Постановления Пле- нума Верховного Суда РФ указанные ли- ца в обязательном порядке привлекаются к производству допроса несовершенно- летнего в возрасте от 14 до 16 лет, а в возрасте от 16 до 18 лет – при условии, что он страдает психическим расстрой- ством или отстаёт в психическом разви- тии [10]. Процессуальным последствием неисполнения предписания ст. 425 УПК РФ является отсутствие доказательствен- ного значения показаний, полученных у несовершеннолетнего (ч. 2 ст. 75 УПК РФ). Говоря об участии педагога и психо- лога в производстве допроса несовершен- нолетнего, нельзя обойти вниманием не- определённость процессуального статуса указанных лиц. Следуя логике законода- теля, можно предположить, что они вво- дятся в уголовный процесс в качестве специалистов и соответственно обладают всей совокупностью прав и обязанностей, предусмотренных ст. 58 УПК РФ. Однако в соответствии с ч. 5 ст. 425 УПК РФ пе- дагог и психолог наделены ограниченным количеством прав, связанных непосред- ственно с производством допроса: с раз- решения следователя, дознавателя зада- вать вопросы несовершеннолетнему по- дозреваемому, обвиняемому; по оконча- нии допроса знакомиться с протоколом допроса и делать письменные замечания о правильности и полноте сделанных в нём записей. За пределами процессуального статуса названных лиц остаются такие права специалиста, как право отказаться от участия в производстве по уголовному делу, если он не обладает соответствую- щими специальными знаниями; прино- сить жалобы на действия (бездействие) и решения дознавателя, начальника подраз- деления дознания, начальника органа до- знания, органа дознания, следователя, прокурора и суда, ограничивающие его права (ч. 3 ст. 58 УПК РФ). Полагаем, что процессуальное положение педагога и психолога нуждается в совершенствова- нии не только с точки зрения общей логи- ки конструирования статуса лиц, содей- ствующих производству по уголовному делу, но и с позиций наметившейся тен- денции к расширению пределов их уча- стия в производстве по уголовным делам в отношении несовершеннолетних. Такое участие носит характер пилотного проек- та и характеризуется сопровождением уголовного дела с момента его возбужде- ния и до проведения реабилитационных мероприятий [11]. В этой связи предлага- ем изложить ч. 5 ст. 425 УПК РФ в сле- дующей редакции: «Педагог и (или) пси- холог в ходе производства допроса несо- вершеннолетнего реализуют права, предусмотренные частью 3 статьи 58 настоящего Кодекса». Специфика предва- рительного расследования при вовлече- нии в судопроизводство несовершенно- летнего предполагает особый режим про- изводства следственных действий. Это касается не только несовершеннолетних обвиняемых, подозреваемых, но и потер- певших и свидетелей. Равенство прав сторон, декларируемое в качестве состав- ного элемента принципа состязательности (ч. 4 ст. 15 УПК РФ), на наш взгляд, предполагает, равенство процессуальных гарантий, предоставляемых всем несо- вершеннолетним, независимо от их фак- тического процессуального статуса. Сравнительный анализ положений ст. 191 УПК РФ и ст. 425 УПК РФ позволяет вы- делить общие гарантии прав и законных ин- тересов несовершеннолетних потерпевших, свидетелей, подозреваемых и обвиняемых при производстве допроса, а именно: – ограничение продолжительности названного следственного действия для возрастной группы от 14 до 18 лет 2 ча- сами без перерыва и общей длительно- стью в течение дня не более 4 часов; – участие педагога и психолога, кото- рое в названных выше случаях является обязательным; – наличие у законного представителя права присутствовать при производстве следственного действия с участием несо- вершеннолетнего. Вместе с тем имеются и существен- ные, на наш взгляд, отличия, которые не оправданы наличием у несовершеннолет- него статуса обвиняемого (подозреваемо- го). Так, если несовершеннолетний явля- ется потерпевшим и свидетелем, то осо- бый режим производства следственных действий распространяется не только на допрос, но и на иные вербальные дей- ствия – очную ставку, опознание и про- верку показаний. Для подозреваемого, обвиняемого речь в ст. 425 УПК РФ идёт только о производстве допроса. Кроме того, в соответствии с ч. 5 ст. 191 УПК РФ в ходе производства следственных действий с участием несовершеннолетне- го потерпевшего или свидетеля обяза- тельно применение видеозаписи или ки- носъемки, материалы которых хранятся при уголовном деле. Исключение состав- ляют случаи, когда несовершеннолетний потерпевший или свидетель либо его за- конный представитель против этого воз- ражают. Полагаем, что подобный подход законодателя позволяет суду более эф- фективно оценить допустимость резуль- татов названных следственных действий, в том числе и с позиций соблюдения прав и законных интересов несовершеннолет- него. В этой связи было бы целесообразно распространить положения ч. 5 ст. 191 УПК РФ и на производство допроса, оч- ной ставки, опознания и проверки показа- ний, проводимых с участием несовер- шеннолетнего подозреваемого, обвиняе- мого. Предлагаем скорректировать ч. 6 ст. 425 УПК РФ следующим образом: «Порядок, установленный настоящей ста- тьей, а также частью 5 статьи 191 насто- ящего Кодекса распространяется и на проведение очной ставки, опознания, проверки показаний несовершеннолетне- го обвиняемого, подозреваемого, подсу- димого». И наконец, самостоятельной проблемой производства предварительно- го расследования является применение к несовершеннолетним мер процессуально- го принуждения. Положения ст. 423 УПК РФ не содержат специальных правил, обособляющих данную категорию обви- няемых, подозреваемых, указывая лишь на тот факт, что при решении вопроса об избрании меры пресечения к несовер- шеннолетнему подозреваемому, обвиняе- мому в каждом случае должна обсуж- даться возможность отдачи его под при- смотр в порядке, предусмотренном ст. 105 УПК РФ. По мнению Г.П. Хими- чевой, это свидетельствует о том, что не всегда возможно «в должной мере учесть баланс между правами несовершеннолет- них и целями уголовного судопроизвод- ства» [12, c. 20], в качестве которых в данном случае выступают обеспечение нормального хода процесса путём пресе- чения и предотвращения дальнейшей про- тивоправной деятельности обвиняемого (подозреваемого), который может скрыться от дознания, следствия или суда, продол- жить преступную деятельность, воспрепят- ствовать производству по уголовному делу, а также обеспечение исполнения приговора или возможной выдачи лица. Избрание той или иной меры пресече- ния из обозначенного в законе перечня осуществляется лицом, ведущим произ- водство по уголовному делу (ч. 1 ст. 97 УПК РФ), при этом специального перечня мер, подлежащих применению к несо- вершеннолетним, в УПК РФ не содер- жится. Дифференцированный подход в данном случае обеспечивается наличием в ст. 99 УПК РФ обстоятельств, учитыва- емых при избрании меры пресечения, в числе которых тяжесть преступления, сведения о личности подозреваемого или обвиняемого, его возраст, состояние здо- ровья, семейное положение, род занятий и другие обстоятельства. Соответствую- щие особенности применительно к несо- вершеннолетним, естественно, связаны с возрастом, что предопределяет необхо- димость учёта уровня эмоциональной, духовной и интеллектуальной зрелости обвиняемого, подозреваемого. В учебной литературе неоднократно указывалось, что оценка названных обстоятельств осу- ществляется дознавателем, следователем исходя из имеющихся данных об эмоцио- нальном состоянии подростка, уровне его возбудимости, степени социализации, пове- денческих реакциях на оценку его поведе- ния окружающими и т.д. [13, c. 316–318]. Как показывает анализ правопримени- тельной практики, наиболее востребован- ными мерами пресечения, применяемыми в отношении несовершеннолетних, явля- ются подписка о невыезде и заключение под стражу [14]. На наш взгляд, это объ- ясняется наличием отлаженного механиз- ма реализации названных мер и формаль- ных критериев ограничения свободы под- ростка в рамках досудебного производ- ства. Так, заключение под стражу приме- няется при наличии следующих условий: – совершение несовершеннолетним тяж- кого или особо тяжкого преступления (ч. 2 ст. 108 УПК РФ), а в исключительных слу- чаях – преступления средней тяжести; – невозможность применения заклю- чения под стражу в отношении несовер- шеннолетнего, не достигшего 16 лет, по- дозреваемого или обвиняемого в совер- шении преступления средней тяжести впервые (ч. 6 ст. 88 УК РФ), а также в от- ношении лица, подозреваемого или обви- няемого в совершении преступления не- большой тяжести, которое совершено им в возрасте до 18 лет (п. 6 Постановления Пленума Верховного Суда РФ от 1 фев- раля 2011 г. № 1 «О судебной практике применения законодательства, регулирую- щего особенности уголовной ответственно- сти и наказания несовершеннолетних»); – необходимость изменения меры пресе- чения в виде заключения под стражу на более мягкую при выявлении у подозреваемого или обвиняемого в совершении преступления тяжёлого заболевания, препятствующего его содержанию под стражей и удостоверенного медицинским заключением, вынесенным по результатам медицинского освидетельство- вания (ч. 1.1 ст. 110 УПК РФ). Как уже было отмечено, специальной мерой пресечения, применяемой в отно- шении несовершеннолетних, является от- дача под присмотр либо родителям, опе- кунам, попечителям или другим заслужи- вающим доверия лицам, либо должност- ным лицам специализированного детско- го учреждения, в котором он находится. В обязанность названным лицам вменяется обеспечение надлежащего поведения подростка, который в соответствии с об- щими условиями применения мер пресе- чения не должен покидать постоянное или временное место жительства без раз- решения дознавателя, следователя или суда; обязан в назначенный срок являться по вызовам в органы уголовной юстиции; не должен препятствовать производству по уголовному делу. Определяющим при выборе меры пресечения, предусмотрен- ной ст. 105 УПК РФ, является наличие у родителей, усыновителей, опекунов, по- печителей или других заслуживающих доверия лиц реальной возможности обес- печить присмотр и надлежащее поведение подростка. Заметим, что, в отличие от иной специальной меры пресечения – наблюдения командования воинской ча- сти, отдача несовершеннолетнего под присмотр осуществляется без учёта его волеизъявления. Это представляется определённым пробелом в законе, по- скольку несовершеннолетний по различ- ным причинам может возражать против отдачи его под присмотр конкретного ли- ца, что не может не отразиться на его дальнейшем поведении, а также суще- ственным образом нивелирует воспита- тельный эффект от применения рассмат- риваемой меры. Представляется, что ст. 105 УПК РФ необходимо дополнить ч. 1.1 следующего содержания: «Избра- ние присмотра в качестве меры пресече- ния допускается с согласия несовершен- нолетнего подозреваемого, обвиняемого». Все перечисленные особенности досу- дебного производства по уголовным де- лам в отношении несовершеннолетних реализуются в условиях выделения уго- ловного дела в отношении него в отдель- ное производство при условии, что это не отразится на всесторонности и объектив- ности предварительного расследования и разрешения уголовного дела (ст. 154, 422 УПК РФ). Кроме того, законодатель предусматривает специальную форму окончания досудебного производства – вынесение постановления о прекращении уголовного преследования и возбуждении перед судом ходатайства о применении к несовершеннолетнему обвиняемому при- нудительной меры воспитательного воз- действия (ч. 1 ст. 427 УПК РФ). Она явля- ется альтернативой уголовному преследо- ванию и возможна при наличии двух условий: совершение несовершеннолет- ним преступления небольшой или сред- ней тяжести впервые, а также установле- ние в ходе расследования возможности исправления несовершеннолетнего обви- няемого без применения наказания.","output":"Процедуры уголовного судопроизводства, касающиеся несовершеннолетних, отличаются расширенными мерами защиты их прав, что обусловлено не только внутренним правом, но и международными стандартами [1]. Существенно важной является квалифицированная юридическая поддержка для несовершеннолетних под стражей или подозреваемых, обусловленная ст. 51 УПК РФ [2], но мнения по поводу круга лиц, выступающих защитниками, расходятся [3]. Верховный Суд РФ и Конституционный Суд подчеркивают недопустимость неквалифицированной юридической помощи, подкрепляя значимость профессионального защитника [5,6]. Правоприменительная практика показывает, что защита обеспечивается по всем необходимым критериям, но задача определения наиболее эффективного защитника остается открытой. Следует расширить перечень лиц, имеющих право быть законными представителями несовершеннолетних, в том числе включая близких родственников и других заинтересованных лиц, с внедрением возможности для семьи и самого подростка влиять на этот выбор [7,8,9]. Касаемо мер пресечения для несовершеннолетних, текущее законодательство требует дальнейшей проработки, так как следует учитывать психологические и социальные особенности обвиняемых несовершеннолетних и при необходимости отдавать их под присмотр лиц, которым они доверяют, что может способствовать их исправлению. Вопрос привлечения к уголовной ответственности несовершеннолетних требует тщательной балансировки между строгостью наказания и возможностью их реабилитации, что является одним из принципов современной уголовной юстиции [12,13,14]."},{"instruction":"przygotuj mi 50 rekordów do bazy danych gdzie (imie=varchar , nazwisko=varchar , miasto=varchar , kod_pocztowy=varchar , wiek=varchar","output":"Przykładowe 50 rekordów dla bazy danych: 1.

And what are important considerations","output":"In my opinion, HR plays a crucial role in effectively promoting staff wellbeing within NRC. They are responsible for creating a supportive and inclusive work environment that fosters the physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing of the employees. Here are a few important considerations for HR in promoting staff wellbeing: 1. Providing comprehensive health benefits: HR should ensure that employees have access to quality healthcare benefits, including medical insurance, mental health support, and preventive care programs. This helps employees take care of their physical and mental health needs. 2. Promoting work-life balance: HR should work towards implementing policies and practices that support work-life balance. This could include flexible working arrangements, remote work options, and promoting the importance of taking time off for vacations and personal commitments. 3. Implementing wellness programs: HR can design and implement wellness programs that include initiatives like fitness classes, stress management workshops, mindfulness sessions, and health campaigns. These programs encourage employees to prioritize their health and wellbeing. 4. Supporting employee development: HR should facilitate employee development by providing access to training and development opportunities. This helps employees feel empowered, motivated, and satisfied, leading to improved overall wellbeing. 5. Encouraging open communication and feedback: HR should create a culture that encourages open communication and feedback. Regular check-ins, surveys, and suggestion boxes can help identify any concerns or issues impacting staff wellbeing, allowing HR to take necessary actions. 6. Ensuring a safe and inclusive workplace: HR should take steps to ensure that the workplace is safe, inclusive, and free from discrimination or harassment. Training programs, policies, and procedures should be in place to address any misconduct and protect employees' psychological wellbeing. 7. Recognizing and rewarding employees: HR should implement recognition and reward programs to acknowledge employees' efforts and achievements. This fosters a positive work environment, increasing overall job satisfaction and wellbeing. 8. Providing employee assistance programs (EAPs): HR should offer EAPs to provide confidential assistance and support to employees facing personal or work-related challenges. EAPs can include counseling services, financial advice, or legal support, helping employees manage their overall wellbeing more effectively. It is important for HR to regularly evaluate the effectiveness of their initiatives and adapt their strategies based on feedback and evolving needs. Employee engagement and involvement in the process are crucial to promote a meaningful and sustainable wellbeing culture within NRC."},{"instruction":"when some one resigned as an HR perspective what's my role here","output":"When someone resigns from the perspective of an HR professional, your role involves several key responsibilities: 1. Exit process: It is your responsibility to manage the exit process. This includes conducting an exit interview to understand the reasons for the resignation, completing necessary paperwork, and ensuring a smooth transition for the departing employee. 2. Documentation: HR should ensure all relevant documentation related to the employee's resignation is properly completed, such as termination letters, final pay calculations, and any necessary legal paperwork. This ensures compliance with employment laws and company policies. 3. Knowledge transfer: If the resigning employee holds critical knowledge or responsibilities, HR should facilitate the transfer of that knowledge to prevent disruptions in workflow. This may involve arranging training or meetings with other team members to ensure a smooth transition. 4. Offboarding: HR should manage the offboarding process, including collecting company property, deactivating access to systems and facilities, and updating internal records. This helps maintain security protocols and protect confidential information. 5. Exit interview analysis: Analyzing the feedback gathered during the exit interview is essential. Look for patterns or recurring issues to identify areas for improvement within the organization and to address any underlying concerns that may affect employee retention. 6. Employee morale and retention: Use the information learned from the exit interview to identify any common themes or concerns that may impact employee morale and retention. Provide feedback and recommendations to management on how to improve these areas to prevent further resignations. 7. Succession planning: In collaboration with relevant stakeholders, HR should identify potential candidates for succession planning purposes. This ensures a smooth transition and minimizes the impact of the resignation on team performance. 8. Continuous improvement: Reflect on the reasons behind the resignation and assess whether any changes need to be made within HR practices, policies, or company culture to improve employee engagement, job satisfaction, and overall retention rates. Ultimately, HR plays a critical role in managing the entire process and ensuring a positive experience for both the resigning employee and the organization as a whole."},{"instruction":"what the possible question for this job description Participate in periodic reviews of HR policies and procedures, recommending changes to the HR Manager. • Maintain a comprehensive understanding of the IRC HR Handbook, support employee interpretations, and maintain compliance. • Representation of the HR department and managing multiple Requests from HRD, HRM, Regional team and Amman based staff. • Responsible for running the HRIS for all field staff, ensuring data accuracy and providing training to new users. • Work together with the HR Coordinator in the implementation of IRC’s Global HR Operating Policies and Procedures and ensure all HR activities are carried-out in adherence to these standards; Undertake necessary steps to align IRC HR functions with Jordan labor law • Administration of all HR functions for national, International in IRC’s offices, including but not limited to orientation, Staff contracts and contracts renewal administration, Changes in status, leave administration, staff exit management and following up with Compensation and benefits unit regarding benefits entitlements, health insurance for staff • Support with International staff HR administration management including but not limited to assignment letters extensions and exit management, etc. • Prepare and submit monthly and quarterly strategic HR metrics and analysis to inform Senior Management Team and Regional HR decision-making, lead on country program inputs to global HR scorecards and Gender Equality initiatives. • Prepare and Review new hires contracts and make sure it is all correct, make sure all onboarding documents are complete and Ensure compliance to hiring policies and procedures, follow up the signatures for the contracts. • handling the on-boarding and orientation process to welcome new and transferred employees ensuring that they have the tools and knowledge needed to perform their job properly and get engaged within the Organization. • Overview and ensure that end-of-probation evaluations occur and that relevant forms are completed. • Follow up with Admin team on work permit applications and tracking system and legal requirements for both national and international staff in consultation with HRM and legal advisor. • Follow up on the performance management process, with guidance from HR Coordinator including but not limited to delivering trainings to staff, following up on submission and calibration sessions. • Handle all related task regarding Volunteers including but not limited to recruiting, retaining, Extension, monthly payments and exit management and adherence to related policies • Serve as a focal point in initiating a unified organizational structure and reflecting the change. • Handling all operational tasks regarding Temporary Transfer assignments and Acting allowances for employees • Maintain the HR data base (inclusive of the leave database, tracking of staff probationary periods, timesheets etc.).

Это объясняется, кроме прочего, необходимостью имплементации обще- признанных стандартов осуществления правосудия в национальную систему пра- ва, которая не оставила в стороне произ- водство по уголовным делам в отношении несовершеннолетних [1]. Представляется, что наиболее значи- мым с точки зрения реализации базового права лица, привлекаемого к уголовной ответственности, является право на ква- лифицированную юридическую помощь, которое в нашем случае трансформирует- ся в обязанность следователя, дознавателя обеспечить участие защитника во всех случаях производства предварительного расследования в отношении несовершен- нолетнего (п. 2 ч. 1 ст. 51 УПК РФ). В этой связи, в специальной литературе дискутируется возможность привлечения в качестве защитника не только адвоката, но и иного лица. Так, часть процессуали- стов категорически возражает против наличия даже потенциальной возможно- сти привлечения непрофессионального защитника для оказания юридической помощи несовершеннолетнему как наря- ду с адвокатом, так и вместо него в про- изводстве у мирового судьи [2, c. 59]. Ещё более категоричным является утвержде- ние о необходимости учёта специализа- ции адвоката при его допуске в уголов- ный процесс в качестве защитника несо- вершеннолетнего [3, c. 26]. Иной подход обосновывается тезисом о том, что каче- ство оказываемой помощи зависит не от профессиональной принадлежности лица, а от его знаний, умений и практических навыков [4, c. 75]. Полагаем, что при ре- шении поставленного вопроса необходи- мо отталкиваться от того факта, что зако- нодатель указывает на адвоката как един- ственно возможного защитника на этапе досудебного производства, что дополни- тельно подчёркивается как применитель- но к несовершеннолетним, так и к иным обвиняемым, подозреваемым в п. 10 По- становления Пленума Верховного Суда РФ от 30 июня 2015 г. № 29 [5], а также неоднократно констатировано Конститу- ционным Судом РФ, позиция которого заключается в том, что оказание неквали- фицированной юридической помощи противоречит задачам правосудия и обя- занности государства обеспечить право- вую поддержку лицу, привлекаемому к уголовной ответственности, независимо от его возраста, социального и имуще- ственного положения, а также иных кри- териев [6]. Анализ правоприменительной практики позволяет утверждать, что в це- лом право на защиту предоставляется несовершеннолетнему обвиняемому (по- дозреваемому) в надлежащем объёме, и его реализация гарантируется следовате- лем, дознавателем. По изученным мате- риалам уголовных дел во всех случаях защитник допускался в уголовный про- цесс в соответствии с требованиями ч. 3 ст. 49 УПК РФ с момента: вынесения по- становления о привлечении несовершен- нолетнего в качестве обвиняемого либо возбуждения в отношении него уголовно- го дела; его фактического задержания в качестве подозреваемого; начала осу- ществления иных мер процессуального принуждения или иных процессуальных действий, затрагивающих права и свободы несовершеннолетнего, включая случаи про- ведения проверки сообщения о преступле- нии, то есть фактически до придания несо- вершеннолетнему процессуального статуса подозреваемого, обвиняемого. Наиболее значимой формой оказания несовершеннолетнему квалифицирован- ной юридической помощи является уча- стие адвоката-защитника в производстве следственных действий. Изучение 43 ма- териалов уголовных дел показало, что та- ковыми являются преимущественно до- просы несовершеннолетних подозревае- мых, обвиняемых, а также очные ставки, опознания и проверки показаний на ме- сте. В ходе производства указанных след- ственных действий защитники реагирова- ли на нарушения прав подозреваемых, отводили вопросы следователя, которые, по их мнению, могли ухудшить процессу- альную позицию подзащитного, а также оказывали на него эмоциональное и пси- хическое воздействие, что нашло отраже- ние в протоколах производства след- ственных действий. Следует также отметить, что законо- датель существенным образом расширил возможности стороны защиты по участию в доказывании, указав на обязательность удовлетворения соответствующих хода- тайств о приобщении к материалам уго- ловного дела предметов и документов, которые имеют доказательственное зна- чение, а также заключений специалистов, полученных в ходе исследований, иници- ированных стороной защиты (ч. 2.2 ст. 159 УПК РФ). Дополнительной гарантией защиты интересов несовершеннолетнего является участие в уголовном процессе его закон- ного представителя, в качестве которого в соответствии с п. 12 ст. 5 УПК РФ при- влекаются родители, усыновители, опе- куны или попечители несовершеннолет- него подозреваемого, обвиняемого, пред- ставители учреждений или организаций, на попечении которых он находится, ор- ганы опеки и попечительства. Участие названных лиц в производстве по уголов- ному делу в данном случае является им- перативным предписанием законодателя и не зависит от волеизъявления как долж- ностного лица, ведущего предварительное расследование, так и самого несовершен- нолетнего обвиняемого, подозреваемого. Тем не менее в соответствии с ч. 4 ст. 426 УПК РФ должностному лицу предостав- лено право отстранить законного пред- ставителя от участия в уголовном деле, если имеются основания полагать, что его действия наносят ущерб интересам несо- вершеннолетнего подозреваемого, обви- няемого. В этом случае к участию в уго- ловном деле допускается другой закон- ный представитель несовершеннолетнего подозреваемого, обвиняемого, что актуа- лизирует вопрос о перечне таковых, по- скольку сопоставление положений ч. 1 ст. 437 УПК РФ (привлечение законных представителей к производству о приме- нении принудительных мер медицинского характера) и ст. 48 УПК РФ позволяет констатировать несовпадение соответ- ствующих перечней. В первом случае он шире, поскольку в качестве законных представителей допускаются близкие родственники, в число которых входят супруг, супруга, родители, дети, усыно- вители, усыновленные, родные братья и родные сестры, дедушка, бабушка, внуки (п. 3 ст. 5 УПК РФ). Следовательно, исхо- дя из положений ст. 437 УПК РФ, в число законных представителей несовершенно- летнего обвиняемого, подозреваемого входят родные братья и сестры, дедушка и бабушка. Возникает вопрос: кого следу- ет привлекать в качестве законного пред- ставителя при реализации положений ч. 4 ст. 426 УПК РФ? Следуя буквальному толкованию закона, можно констатиро- вать, что в соответствии с п. 12 ст. 5 УПК РФ привлекать следует орган опеки и по- печительства, однако, по справедливому замечанию Г.Н. Смирновой, это идёт вразрез с интересами несовершеннолетнего, поскольку представители публичных орга- нов безразличны к его судьбе, в отличие от близких родственников [3, c. 28]. О справед- ливости данного тезиса свидетельствует и эмпирический анализ. Так, из 43 материа- лов уголовных дел в 8 случаях представи- тели органа опеки и попечительства были привлечены в качестве законных предста- вителей несовершеннолетнего и в 3 из них заявили ходатайства о рассмотрении уголовного дела в судебном заседании без их участия. В специальной литературе по данному вопросу нет единства мнений. Так, например, Р.И. Зайнуллин указывает на необходимость решения вопроса о представительстве при помощи семейно- го соглашения, а при невозможности та- кового выбор законного представителя должен быть предоставлен самому несо- вершеннолетнему обвиняемому, подозре- ваемому [7, c. 4]. Аналогичной точки зре- ния придерживается и А.А. Андрейкин, указывая применительно к несовершенно- летнему потерпевшему, что его заинтересо- ванность в исходе уголовного дела позволя- ет наиболее эффективно решить вопрос о законном представителе [8, c. 44]. Полагаем, что в данном случае справедливы и доводы тех процессуалистов, которые указывают на этические пороки подобного подхода, когда подросток легально вынужден де- лать выбор, например, между отцом и ма- терью, в то время как во главу угла необ- ходимо ставить не личные отношения, а эффективность деятельности по защите интересов несовершеннолетнего [9, c. 49]. Думается, что при решении данного во- проса необходимо исходить из следую- щего. Во-первых, законный представи- тель в условиях обязательного участия защитника оказывает несовершеннолет- нему не юридическую, а, скорее, мораль- но-психологическую помощь, что пред- полагает наличие между ними неких до- верительных отношений. Во-вторых, он обязан действовать в интересах несовер- шеннолетнего, о чём с очевидностью сви- детельствуют приведённые выше поло- жения ч. 4 ст. 426 УПК РФ. В-третьих, законный представитель наделён широ- ким комплексом прав, который совместно с правами, предоставляемыми защитнику, позволяет оптимальным образом гаранти- ровать защиту интересов несовершенно- летнего. В этой связи представляется, что если будет установлено наличие благопо- лучных условий жизни и воспитания несовершеннолетнего, что является со- ставным элементом предмета доказыва- ния, то право выбора законного предста- вителя должно быть предоставлено семье с учётом мнения подростка. Если же си- туация обратная, то выбор законного представителя должен оставаться в ком- петенции следователя, который собирает информацию о внутрисемейных отноше- ниях не только от заинтересованных лиц, но и от соседей, педагогов, инспекторов по делам несовершеннолетних и т.д. В этой связи полагаем, что перечень лиц, которые могут быть законными представителями несовершеннолетнего обвиняемого, подозреваемого, необходи- мо расширить, включив в него, помимо лиц, указанных в п. 12 ст. 5 УПК РФ: – иных, кроме родителей, близких род- ственников несовершеннолетнего (родных братьев и родных сестер, дедушку, бабушку); – близких лиц несовершеннолетнего, здоровье и благополучие которого дороги им, в силу сложившихся личных отношений. В соответствии с ч. 2 ст. 426 УПК РФ в досудебном производстве законный представитель обвиняемого, подозревае- мого наделяется определёнными правами: знать, в чём подозревается или обвиняет- ся несовершеннолетний; присутствовать при предъявлении обвинения; участво- вать в допросе несовершеннолетнего по- дозреваемого, обвиняемого, а также с разрешения следователя – в иных след- ственных действиях, производимых с его участием и участием защитника; знако- миться с протоколами следственных дей- ствий, в которых он принимал участие, и делать письменные замечания о правиль- ности и полноте сделанных в них записей; заявлять ходатайства и отводы, приносить жалобы на действия (бездействие) и ре- шения дознавателя, следователя, проку- рора; представлять доказательства; по окончании предварительного расследова- ния знакомиться со всеми материалами уголовного дела, выписывать из него лю- бые сведения и в любом объёме. Анализ совокупности норм уголовно- процессуального закона, регламентиру- ющих особенности производства предва- рительного расследования по уголовным делам в отношении несовершеннолетних, позволяет констатировать наличие опре- делённых сложностей в реализации неко- торых из названных прав законного пред- ставителя. Так, не вызывает сомнений обоснованность наличия права знать о сущности предъявленного несовершенно- летнему обвинения либо подозрения. Од- нако механизм его реализации законом фактически не предусмотрен. Так, в дей- ствующей редакции ч. 1 ст. 426 УПК РФ законный представитель может быть до- пущен в процесс только с момента перво- го допроса несовершеннолетнего в каче- стве подозреваемого или обвиняемого, тогда же ему и разъясняются приведён- ные выше права. Соответственно о сущ- ности подозрения или обвинения закон- ный представитель может узнать уже в ходе производства допроса, но никак не раньше. Аналогичные проблемы возни- кают и при реализации права законного представителя присутствовать при предъ- явлении обвинения, поскольку первый допрос несовершеннолетнего в качестве обвиняемого следует за процедурой предъявления обвинения, а не предше- ствует ей. Полагаем, что указанные про- тиворечия были бы сняты при изменении момента допуска законного представите- ля к участию в производстве по уголов- ному делу. На наш взгляд, таковой дол- жен быть зависим не от производства следственного действия, а от придания несовершеннолетнему процессуального статуса подозреваемого или обвиняемого, что позволяет провести аналогию с до- пуском в уголовный процесс защитника при наличии у названных субъектов идентичной функции, выполняемой в разных формах, – защиты законных прав и интересов несовершеннолетнего. В этой связи предлагаем изложить ч. 1 ст. 426 УПК РФ в следующей редакции: «Закон- ные представители несовершеннолетнего подозреваемого, обвиняемого допускают- ся к участию в уголовном деле на основа- нии постановления следователя, дознава- теля с момента вынесения постановления о привлечении несовершеннолетнего в качестве обвиняемого либо с момента наделения его статусом подозреваемого в соответствии с положениями части 1 ста- тьи 46 настоящего Кодекса. При допуске к участию в уголовном деле им разъяс- няются права, предусмотренные частью второй настоящей статьи». Возрастные особенности подозревае- мых, обвиняемых в рассматриваемых случаях требуют использования специ- альных познаний, что реализуется по- средством привлечения педагога или пси- холога к допросу несовершеннолетнего. В соответствии с п. 9 Постановления Пле- нума Верховного Суда РФ указанные ли- ца в обязательном порядке привлекаются к производству допроса несовершенно- летнего в возрасте от 14 до 16 лет, а в возрасте от 16 до 18 лет – при условии, что он страдает психическим расстрой- ством или отстаёт в психическом разви- тии [10]. Процессуальным последствием неисполнения предписания ст. 425 УПК РФ является отсутствие доказательствен- ного значения показаний, полученных у несовершеннолетнего (ч. 2 ст. 75 УПК РФ). Говоря об участии педагога и психо- лога в производстве допроса несовершен- нолетнего, нельзя обойти вниманием не- определённость процессуального статуса указанных лиц. Следуя логике законода- теля, можно предположить, что они вво- дятся в уголовный процесс в качестве специалистов и соответственно обладают всей совокупностью прав и обязанностей, предусмотренных ст. 58 УПК РФ. Однако в соответствии с ч. 5 ст. 425 УПК РФ пе- дагог и психолог наделены ограниченным количеством прав, связанных непосред- ственно с производством допроса: с раз- решения следователя, дознавателя зада- вать вопросы несовершеннолетнему по- дозреваемому, обвиняемому; по оконча- нии допроса знакомиться с протоколом допроса и делать письменные замечания о правильности и полноте сделанных в нём записей. За пределами процессуального статуса названных лиц остаются такие права специалиста, как право отказаться от участия в производстве по уголовному делу, если он не обладает соответствую- щими специальными знаниями; прино- сить жалобы на действия (бездействие) и решения дознавателя, начальника подраз- деления дознания, начальника органа до- знания, органа дознания, следователя, прокурора и суда, ограничивающие его права (ч. 3 ст. 58 УПК РФ). Полагаем, что процессуальное положение педагога и психолога нуждается в совершенствова- нии не только с точки зрения общей логи- ки конструирования статуса лиц, содей- ствующих производству по уголовному делу, но и с позиций наметившейся тен- денции к расширению пределов их уча- стия в производстве по уголовным делам в отношении несовершеннолетних. Такое участие носит характер пилотного проек- та и характеризуется сопровождением уголовного дела с момента его возбужде- ния и до проведения реабилитационных мероприятий [11]. В этой связи предлага- ем изложить ч. 5 ст. 425 УПК РФ в сле- дующей редакции: «Педагог и (или) пси- холог в ходе производства допроса несо- вершеннолетнего реализуют права, предусмотренные частью 3 статьи 58 настоящего Кодекса». Специфика предва- рительного расследования при вовлече- нии в судопроизводство несовершенно- летнего предполагает особый режим про- изводства следственных действий. Это касается не только несовершеннолетних обвиняемых, подозреваемых, но и потер- певших и свидетелей. Равенство прав сторон, декларируемое в качестве состав- ного элемента принципа состязательности (ч. 4 ст. 15 УПК РФ), на наш взгляд, предполагает, равенство процессуальных гарантий, предоставляемых всем несо- вершеннолетним, независимо от их фак- тического процессуального статуса. Сравнительный анализ положений ст. 191 УПК РФ и ст. 425 УПК РФ позволяет вы- делить общие гарантии прав и законных ин- тересов несовершеннолетних потерпевших, свидетелей, подозреваемых и обвиняемых при производстве допроса, а именно: – ограничение продолжительности названного следственного действия для возрастной группы от 14 до 18 лет 2 ча- сами без перерыва и общей длительно- стью в течение дня не более 4 часов; – участие педагога и психолога, кото- рое в названных выше случаях является обязательным; – наличие у законного представителя права присутствовать при производстве следственного действия с участием несо- вершеннолетнего. Вместе с тем имеются и существен- ные, на наш взгляд, отличия, которые не оправданы наличием у несовершеннолет- него статуса обвиняемого (подозреваемо- го). Так, если несовершеннолетний явля- ется потерпевшим и свидетелем, то осо- бый режим производства следственных действий распространяется не только на допрос, но и на иные вербальные дей- ствия – очную ставку, опознание и про- верку показаний. Для подозреваемого, обвиняемого речь в ст. 425 УПК РФ идёт только о производстве допроса. Кроме того, в соответствии с ч. 5 ст. 191 УПК РФ в ходе производства следственных действий с участием несовершеннолетне- го потерпевшего или свидетеля обяза- тельно применение видеозаписи или ки- носъемки, материалы которых хранятся при уголовном деле. Исключение состав- ляют случаи, когда несовершеннолетний потерпевший или свидетель либо его за- конный представитель против этого воз- ражают. Полагаем, что подобный подход законодателя позволяет суду более эф- фективно оценить допустимость резуль- татов названных следственных действий, в том числе и с позиций соблюдения прав и законных интересов несовершеннолет- него. В этой связи было бы целесообразно распространить положения ч. 5 ст. 191 УПК РФ и на производство допроса, оч- ной ставки, опознания и проверки показа- ний, проводимых с участием несовер- шеннолетнего подозреваемого, обвиняе- мого. Предлагаем скорректировать ч. 6 ст. 425 УПК РФ следующим образом: «Порядок, установленный настоящей ста- тьей, а также частью 5 статьи 191 насто- ящего Кодекса распространяется и на проведение очной ставки, опознания, проверки показаний несовершеннолетне- го обвиняемого, подозреваемого, подсу- димого». И наконец, самостоятельной проблемой производства предварительно- го расследования является применение к несовершеннолетним мер процессуально- го принуждения. Положения ст. 423 УПК РФ не содержат специальных правил, обособляющих данную категорию обви- няемых, подозреваемых, указывая лишь на тот факт, что при решении вопроса об избрании меры пресечения к несовер- шеннолетнему подозреваемому, обвиняе- мому в каждом случае должна обсуж- даться возможность отдачи его под при- смотр в порядке, предусмотренном ст. 105 УПК РФ. По мнению Г.П. Хими- чевой, это свидетельствует о том, что не всегда возможно «в должной мере учесть баланс между правами несовершеннолет- них и целями уголовного судопроизвод- ства» [12, c. 20], в качестве которых в данном случае выступают обеспечение нормального хода процесса путём пресе- чения и предотвращения дальнейшей про- тивоправной деятельности обвиняемого (подозреваемого), который может скрыться от дознания, следствия или суда, продол- жить преступную деятельность, воспрепят- ствовать производству по уголовному делу, а также обеспечение исполнения приговора или возможной выдачи лица. Избрание той или иной меры пресече- ния из обозначенного в законе перечня осуществляется лицом, ведущим произ- водство по уголовному делу (ч. 1 ст. 97 УПК РФ), при этом специального перечня мер, подлежащих применению к несо- вершеннолетним, в УПК РФ не содер- жится. Дифференцированный подход в данном случае обеспечивается наличием в ст. 99 УПК РФ обстоятельств, учитыва- емых при избрании меры пресечения, в числе которых тяжесть преступления, сведения о личности подозреваемого или обвиняемого, его возраст, состояние здо- ровья, семейное положение, род занятий и другие обстоятельства. Соответствую- щие особенности применительно к несо- вершеннолетним, естественно, связаны с возрастом, что предопределяет необхо- димость учёта уровня эмоциональной, духовной и интеллектуальной зрелости обвиняемого, подозреваемого. В учебной литературе неоднократно указывалось, что оценка названных обстоятельств осу- ществляется дознавателем, следователем исходя из имеющихся данных об эмоцио- нальном состоянии подростка, уровне его возбудимости, степени социализации, пове- денческих реакциях на оценку его поведе- ния окружающими и т.д. [13, c. 316–318]. Как показывает анализ правопримени- тельной практики, наиболее востребован- ными мерами пресечения, применяемыми в отношении несовершеннолетних, явля- ются подписка о невыезде и заключение под стражу [14]. На наш взгляд, это объ- ясняется наличием отлаженного механиз- ма реализации названных мер и формаль- ных критериев ограничения свободы под- ростка в рамках досудебного производ- ства. Так, заключение под стражу приме- няется при наличии следующих условий: – совершение несовершеннолетним тяж- кого или особо тяжкого преступления (ч. 2 ст. 108 УПК РФ), а в исключительных слу- чаях – преступления средней тяжести; – невозможность применения заклю- чения под стражу в отношении несовер- шеннолетнего, не достигшего 16 лет, по- дозреваемого или обвиняемого в совер- шении преступления средней тяжести впервые (ч. 6 ст. 88 УК РФ), а также в от- ношении лица, подозреваемого или обви- няемого в совершении преступления не- большой тяжести, которое совершено им в возрасте до 18 лет (п. 6 Постановления Пленума Верховного Суда РФ от 1 фев- раля 2011 г. № 1 «О судебной практике применения законодательства, регулирую- щего особенности уголовной ответственно- сти и наказания несовершеннолетних»); – необходимость изменения меры пресе- чения в виде заключения под стражу на более мягкую при выявлении у подозреваемого или обвиняемого в совершении преступления тяжёлого заболевания, препятствующего его содержанию под стражей и удостоверенного медицинским заключением, вынесенным по результатам медицинского освидетельство- вания (ч. 1.1 ст. 110 УПК РФ). Как уже было отмечено, специальной мерой пресечения, применяемой в отно- шении несовершеннолетних, является от- дача под присмотр либо родителям, опе- кунам, попечителям или другим заслужи- вающим доверия лицам, либо должност- ным лицам специализированного детско- го учреждения, в котором он находится. В обязанность названным лицам вменяется обеспечение надлежащего поведения подростка, который в соответствии с об- щими условиями применения мер пресе- чения не должен покидать постоянное или временное место жительства без раз- решения дознавателя, следователя или суда; обязан в назначенный срок являться по вызовам в органы уголовной юстиции; не должен препятствовать производству по уголовному делу. Определяющим при выборе меры пресечения, предусмотрен- ной ст. 105 УПК РФ, является наличие у родителей, усыновителей, опекунов, по- печителей или других заслуживающих доверия лиц реальной возможности обес- печить присмотр и надлежащее поведение подростка. Заметим, что, в отличие от иной специальной меры пресечения – наблюдения командования воинской ча- сти, отдача несовершеннолетнего под присмотр осуществляется без учёта его волеизъявления. Это представляется определённым пробелом в законе, по- скольку несовершеннолетний по различ- ным причинам может возражать против отдачи его под присмотр конкретного ли- ца, что не может не отразиться на его дальнейшем поведении, а также суще- ственным образом нивелирует воспита- тельный эффект от применения рассмат- риваемой меры. Представляется, что ст. 105 УПК РФ необходимо дополнить ч. 1.1 следующего содержания: «Избра- ние присмотра в качестве меры пресече- ния допускается с согласия несовершен- нолетнего подозреваемого, обвиняемого». Все перечисленные особенности досу- дебного производства по уголовным де- лам в отношении несовершеннолетних реализуются в условиях выделения уго- ловного дела в отношении него в отдель- ное производство при условии, что это не отразится на всесторонности и объектив- ности предварительного расследования и разрешения уголовного дела (ст. 154, 422 УПК РФ). Кроме того, законодатель предусматривает специальную форму окончания досудебного производства – вынесение постановления о прекращении уголовного преследования и возбуждении перед судом ходатайства о применении к несовершеннолетнему обвиняемому при- нудительной меры воспитательного воз- действия (ч. 1 ст. 427 УПК РФ). Она явля- ется альтернативой уголовному преследо- ванию и возможна при наличии двух условий: совершение несовершеннолет- ним преступления небольшой или сред- ней тяжести впервые, а также установле- ние в ходе расследования возможности исправления несовершеннолетнего обви- няемого без применения наказания.","output":"Уголовные дела против несовершеннолетних особенны дополнительными мерами защиты их прав, что связано с внедрением международных стандартов в национальное право [1]. Основополагающим правом молодых обвиняемых считается доступ к качественной юридической поддержке. Следствие обязано обеспечить присутствие адвоката с начала предварительного расследования, как это закреплено в статье 51 УПК РФ [2]. Дебаты в специализированной литературе касаются допустимости непрофессиональных защитников, но есть аргументы в пользу важности практического опыта защитника, а не только его лицензии [4]. Законодательство выделяет адвоката как необходимого участника на стадии следствия для всех, включая несовершеннолетних, чему способствуют решения Конституционного Суда РФ о необходимости квалифицированных юридических услуг [5][6]. Право на защиту для молодых преступников обычно обеспечивается, что подтверждают материалы уголовных дел, где защитники участвуют согласно закону [3]. Суд по уголовным делам несовершеннолетних также задействует законных представителей молодых обвиняемых, включая родителей и опекунов, их участие является обязательным [5]. Разногласия в специальной литературе касаются выбора наиболее эффективных и надежных законных представителей, подчеркивая значение эмоциональных связей и интересов несовершеннолетнего [7][8][9]. Предложено расширить круг лиц, которые могут стать законными представителями, добавив близких родственников и доверенных лиц [3]. Вместе с тем, несовершеннолетние обладают специфическими гарантиями, которые могут требовать уточнения для повышения эффективности уголовного процесса, таких как участие в выборе законного представителя и специальные процедуры приложения мер принуждения [10][11][12]. Иногда в расследовании вводятся специалисты для оказания помощи, например, педагоги или психологи, которые содействуют в процессе допроса молодых подозреваемых или обвиняемых [10]. Уголовные дела против несовершеннолетних могут закончиться вынесением решения о применении мер воспитательного воздействия вместо наказания, если это поможет их исправлению без уголовного преследования [13]."},{"instruction":"przygotuj mi 50 rekordów do bazy danych w sql gdzie (imie=varchar , nazwisko=varchar , miasto=varchar , kod_pocztowy=varchar , wiek=varchar","output":"Przykładowe 50 rekordów do bazy danych w SQL: 1.
