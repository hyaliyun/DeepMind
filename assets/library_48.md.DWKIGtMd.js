This is because the only line perpendicular to n and not in plane beta would be parallel to this plane. Thus, l parallel beta. 3. **Plane alpha intersects plane beta**: The fact that lines m and n are skew lines (they do not intersect and are not parallel) and each is perpendicular to a different plane (m bot alpha and n bot beta) implies that planes alpha and beta must intersect.

Consider all integers ( a_i ) from the interval ( left(-frac{p}{2}, frac{p}{2}right) ) that satisfy ( p equiv a_i  (text{mod}  3) ). 3.

This is because if ( a_i = -a_j ) for some ( i ) and ( j ), we would have ( a_i + a_j = 0 implies p equiv 0  (text{mod}  3) ), which contradicts the given condition that ( p ) is not divisible by 3. 4. We now need to confirm that any number ( t ) from ( left(0, frac{p}{2}right) ) that is not divisible by 3 coincides with one of ( |a_i| ). Suppose ( t in left(0, frac{p}{2}right) ), ( t not equiv 0  (text{mod}  3) ). Then either ( t equiv p  (text{mod}  3) ) or ( -t equiv p  (text{mod}  3) ).

All ( b_i ) are distinct. Suppose ( b_i = b_j ) for some ( i, j ). Since ( p - a_i neq p - a_j ), it follows that ( gamma_i neq gamma_j ).

Then there exists a natural ( gamma ) such that ( t cdot 3^{gamma} in left(frac{p}{2}, frac{3p}{2}right) ).

Hence ( t cdot 3^gamma = p - a_i implies t = b_i ). 11. Thus, the set of numbers ( b_i ) matches the set of all numbers in the interval ( left(0, frac{p}{2}right) ) that are not divisible by 3 and therefore, coincides with the set of numbers ( |a_i| ). 12.

Notice that (a + b^2) and (b + a^2) must both be powers of 2 because their product is a power of 2. Let (a + b^2 = 2^k) and (b + a^2 = 2^l) where (k) and (l) are non-negative integers such that (k + l = m). 3. Since (a + b^2) and (b + a^2) are both even, (a) and (b) must have the same parity (both even or both odd). This is because if one were odd and the other even, one of the expressions would be odd, contradicting the fact that they are both powers of 2. 4. Without loss of generality, assume (a geq b).

Each of these new numbers is tripled, resulting in 3(x+5) and 3(y+5).  4. The sum of these tripled numbers becomes:    [    3(x+5) + 3(y+5) = 3x + 15 + 3y + 15 = 3(x+y) + 30    ] 5.

He earns 9 dollars for each lawn he mows, 10 euros for each car he washes, and 50 pesos for every dog he walks. He had 12 lawns to mow, 6 cars to wash, and 4 dogs to walk. However, he forgot to mow 8 lawns, wash 2 cars, and walk 1 dog. If Adam completes 80% of tasks in a category, he gets a 10% bonus for that task type. Consider the exchange rates: 1 euro = 1.1 dollars, and 1 peso = 0.05 dollars. Calculate the total amount of money Adam actually earned in dollars after considering the bonuses and converting all currencies to dollars.","output":"First, let's calculate the amount Adam earned for each task without considering the bonuses: For lawn mowing: He was supposed to mow 12 lawns but forgot 8, so he mowed 12 - 8 = 4 lawns. He earns 9 dollars per lawn, so for 4 lawns, he earns 4 * 9 = 36 dollars. For car washing: He was supposed to wash 6 cars but forgot 2, so he washed 6 - 2 = 4 cars. He earns 10 euros per car, so for 4 cars, he earns 4 * 10 = 40 euros. For dog walking: He was supposed to walk 4 dogs but forgot 1, so he walked 4 - 1 = 3 dogs. He earns 50 pesos per dog, so for 3 dogs, he earns 3 * 50 = 150 pesos. Now, let's calculate the completion rate for each task to determine if he gets a bonus: For lawn mowing: He completed 4 out of 12 tasks, which is 4/12 = 0.333 or 33.3%, so no bonus. For car washing: He completed 4 out of 6 tasks, which is 4/6 = 0.666 or 66.6%, so no bonus. For dog walking: He completed 3 out of 4 tasks, which is 3/4 = 0.75 or 75%, so no bonus. Since he didn't reach the 80% completion rate for any task, he doesn't get any bonuses. Now, let's convert the earnings from euros and pesos to dollars: For euros: He earned 40 euros from washing cars. With the exchange rate of 1 euro = 1.1 dollars, he gets 40 * 1.1 = 44 dollars. For pesos: He earned 150 pesos from walking dogs. With the exchange rate of 1 peso = 0.05 dollars, he gets 150 * 0.05 = 7.5 dollars. Finally, let's add up all his earnings in dollars: From lawn mowing: 36 dollars From car washing (converted from euros): 44 dollars From dog walking (converted from pesos): 7.5 dollars Total earnings in dollars: 36 + 44 + 7.5 = 87.5 dollars Adam actually earned a total of boxed{87.5}  dollars after considering the tasks he completed and converting all currencies to dollars."},{"instruction":"A man has some hens and cows.

We also know that the total number of heads is 48. Since each animal has one head, the number of cows can be calculated as: C = Total heads - H C = 48 - 24 C = 24 (the number of cows) Now, we need to calculate the total number of feet. Hens have 2 feet each, and cows have 4 feet each. Total feet = (Number of hens * Feet per hen) + (Number of cows * Feet per cow) Total feet = (H * 2) + (C * 4) Substitute the values of H and C: Total feet = (24 * 2) + (24 * 4) Total feet = (48) + (96) Total feet = 144 So, there are boxed{144}  feet in total."},{"instruction":"Sherlock and Mycroft play a game involving flipping a single fair coin.

We are dealing with a fair coin, which means every flip has a probability of (1/2) for heads (H) and (1/2) for tails (T). 1. **Calculate the probability that Sherlock wins:**    Sherlock wins if the sequence (TTT) (tails-tails-tails) appears first.    - For Sherlock to win, we need exactly three consecutive tails:          P(text{TTT}) = left(frac{1}{2}right) times left(frac{1}{2}right) times left(frac{1}{2}right) = frac{1}{8}.    Therefore, Sherlock's probability of winning is ( frac{1}{8} ). 2. **Calculate the probability that Mycroft wins:**    Mycroft wins if the sequence (HTT) (heads-tails-tails) appears first.    Consider the set of sequences where Mycroft wins prior to Sherlock. The set of sequences where Mycroft wins (denoted as (M)) includes:        [    begin{aligned}    &{HTT, HHTT, THTT, HHHTT, TTHHTT, cdots}.    end{aligned}    ]    - Now, let’s compare probabilities by understanding that there would be more variability and opportunities for (HTT) to appear before (TTT). 3. **Understanding the probability spaces:**    - The possible coin results leading to the final sequences can be complex to calculate directly without simulation or more advanced combinatorial methods.    - However, considering that any sequences must eventually form the sequences (HTT) or (TTT), the presence of (H) in the sequence offers more possibilities due to the intervening head which cuts off earlier (TTT) sequences, increasing the likelihood of (HTT) appearing before (TTT). 4. **Compare probabilities:**    - Sherlock’s sequence (TTT) appears only after ensuring three continuous tails with no head interruptions.     - Mycroft’s sequence (HTT) can appear in-between heads and tails more flexibly. Therefore, **Mycroft** has a higher probability compared to Sherlock since the variations in sequences till (HTT) appear first are more frequent naturally, given the interruptions by heads in a fair coin flips.

Thus, ( h = frac{5}{2} = 2.5 ) meters. 3. **Volume Calculation**:    - The pile of grain can geometrically be broken down into simpler shapes.

We will use a coordinate system where the sides of the square are aligned parallel to the axes. **Step-by-Step Solution:** 1. **Set Up the Coordinate System:**     - Align the square such that its sides are parallel to the x-axis and y-axis.     - The square's coordinates can be thought of such that its sides correspond to y = y_1, y = y_2 (parallel to the x-axis), and x = x_1, x = x_2 (parallel to the y-axis). 2. **Reflecting along Horizontal Lines:**     - Consider a point P(x_p, y_p).     - First reflect P over the line y = y_1.

Let's check for plausible (r) values:    - For (r = 2):      [      1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15      ]      Thus, the sum becomes:      [      15a = 1417 implies a = frac{1417}{15} text{ which is not an integer}      ]    - For (r = 3):      [      1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40      ]      Thus, the sum becomes:      [      40a = 1417 implies a = frac{1417}{40} text{ which is not an integer}      ]    - For (r = 4):      [      1 + 4 + 16 + 64 = 85      ]      Thus, the sum becomes:      [      85a = 1417 implies a = frac{1417}{85} = 17 text{ which is an integer}      ]      Hence, we found a valid solution with (r = 4) and (a = 17). So, the numbers in the sequence are:      [      17, 17 cdot 4, 17 cdot 4^2, 17 cdot 4^3      ] 5. **Step 5: Calculation of the Numbers in the Sequence**     - The first term is:       [       a = 17       ]     - The second term is:       [       ar = 17 cdot 4 = 68       ]     - The third term is:       [       ar^2 = 17 cdot 16 = 272       ]     - The fourth term is:       [       ar^3 = 17 cdot 64 = 1088       ]     Hence, the sequence is (17, 68, 272, 1088). 6. **Step 6: Identifying the Second Largest Number**     We arrange the numbers in ascending order:     [     17, 68, 272, 1088     ]     The second largest number is (272). # Conclusion: [ boxed{272} ]"},{"instruction":"The graph of the function y=log_a(x1)+2 (a>0 and aneq1) always passes through a fixed point.","output":"For the function y=log_a(x-1)+2, let's find the fixed point it passes through regardless of the value of a (given a>0 and aneq1).

Given that the range of sine function for an angle in a triangle is between -1 and 1, the possible values for A are A = frac{pi}{3} or A = frac{2pi}{3}. (2) Since angle A is an acute angle, we have that A = frac{pi}{3}.   Therefore, using the cosine rule, cos A = frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc} = frac{1}{2}.

Similarly, PS is parallel to AC, and PQ is parallel to AB. This implies that triangle PQS and triangle ABC are similar because their corresponding sides are parallel. 2. **Determine Side Lengths in triangle PQS**: Since the circles are tangent and their centers are connected, the distances between the centers equal the sum of their radii. Therefore, we have:    [QR = RS = PR = PS = 1 + 1 = 2.] 3. **Find Angles in triangle PQS**: Knowing triangle PRS is equilateral (since PR=PS=RS), we find angle PSR = angle PRS = 60^circ.

Therefore,    [    M_k = C_k^k W_k + C_{k+1}^k W_{k+1} + ldots + C_n^k W_n    ] 4. Rearrange the sum for alternating signs:    [    M_1 - M_2 + M_3 - ldots = C_1^1 W_1 + (C_2^1 - C_2^2) W_2 + ldots + (C_n^1 - C_n^2 + C_n^3 - ldots) W_n    ] 5. It is known (C_m^1 - C_m^2 + C_m^3 - ldots - (-1)^m C_m^m = 1) (refer to problem ( underline{60412} )). 6. Therefore,    [    W_1 + W_2 + ldots + W_n = S    ] 7. Hence,     [    S = M_1 - M_2 + M_3 - ldots + (-1)^{n+1} M_n    ]    This completes part **(a)**.  Part b: 1. According to part (a),    [    S = M_1 - M_2 + ldots + (-1)^{m+1} M_m + (-1)^{m+2} M_{m+1} + (-1)^{m+3} M_{m+2} + ldots + (-1)^{n+1} M_n     ] 2. Consider the difference:    [    S - left( M_1 - M_2 + ldots + (-1)^{m+1} M_m right)    ] 3. The remaining terms are:    [    = (-1)^{m+2} M_{m+1} + (-1)^{m+3} M_{m+2} + ldots + (-1)^{n+1} M_n    ] 4. Expressing the sum as:    [    = sum_{i=1}^{n} left( (-1)^{m+2} C_i^{m+1} + (-1)^{m+3} C_i^{m+2} + ldots + (-1)^{n+1} C_i^{n} right) W_i    ]    where it is considered that if k > i, then ( C_i^k = 0 ). 5.

From the given information, we know that: 1. The cost of the first 20 kgs of apples is 100 rupees, which means ( l times 20 = 100 ) rupees. 2. The cost of 36 kgs of apples is 186 rupees. Let's find the value of ( l ) first: ( l times 20 = 100 ) ( l = frac{100}{20} ) ( l = 5 ) rupees per kilogram for the first 30 kgs. Now, let's calculate the cost of the first 30 kgs of apples: ( C_{30} = l times 30 ) ( C_{30} = 5 times 30 ) ( C_{30} = 150 ) rupees. Since the cost of 36 kgs of apples is 186 rupees, the cost of the additional 6 kgs (36 kgs - 30 kgs) is: ( 186 - C_{30} ) ( 186 - 150 = 36 ) rupees. Now, we can find the cost per kilogram for the additional apples (( q )): ( C_{add} = q times 6 ) ( 36 = q times 6 ) ( q = frac{36}{6} ) ( q = 6 ) rupees per kilogram for each additional kilogram. Now we can calculate the price of 33 kilograms of apples: - The first 30 kgs cost 150 rupees (as we calculated earlier). - The additional 3 kgs will cost ( q times 3 ): ( q times 3 = 6 times 3 = 18 ) rupees. So, the price of 33 kilograms of apples is: ( C_{30} + (q times 3) ) ( 150 + 18 = 168 ) rupees.

The number of workers who have read neither book is therefore ((1/4)W - B) - 1. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of workers who have read both books. The principle of inclusion-exclusion states that to find the total number of elements in two sets, we add the number of elements in each set and subtract the number of elements that are in both sets.

Noting that angle BAC and angle BCD are part of the regular hexagon, the angle between overline{AB} and overline{CD} is 120^circ + 120^circ = 240^circ. Since overline{AB} and overline{CD} are both extending outwards, the external angle at Q, which is angle AQC, is a full 360^circ minus the 240^circ internal angle, giving angle AQC = 360^circ - 240^circ = 120^circ.

Observing that angle BOC is a right angle, we can conclude that quadrilateral BB_{1}CO is a cyclic quadrilateral. Given that BO = CO, it follows that B_{1}O is the angle bisector of angle BB_{1}C. This implies that B_{1}D_{1} passes through point O. 3. Next, note that angle D_{1}OD = angle BB_{1}C = angle DGD_{1}, implying that quadrilateral DGO D_{1} is also cyclic. Hence, OG perp OD_{1}. Similarly, we can show that OF perp OD_{1}, indicating that line FG passes through O. 4. Therefore, the lines B_{1}D_{1} and FG are perpendicular and intersect at the center O of the square. Consequently, segments CG and AF are equal (they are symmetric about O). 5. Segments BF and AD_{1} are also equal because they can be obtained from each other by a 90^circ rotation around O. 6.

Substitute this into the equation:     [     (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2) = 633 cdot p     ] 4. The prime factorization of 633 is:     [     633 = 3 cdot 211     ]     Therefore, the equation becomes:     [     (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2) = 3 cdot 211 cdot p     ] 5.

To solve this, we will conduct a geometric analysis by following these steps: 1. **Partitioning the plane**:     - Divide the plane into identical squares with a side length of 2R, where R is the radius of the quarter-circles. This will allow us to systematically analyze the layout and movement direction of each track segment. 2. **Coloring the squares**:     - Let's color these squares in a chessboard pattern, where alternating squares are colored black and white. 3. **Inscribing circles**:     - Inside each square, inscribe a circle of radius R. These inscribed circles will represent the paths on which the train will travel. 4. **Analyzing track segments**:     - Place the quarter-circle segments onto these inscribed circles. Notice that:         - A quarter-circle track segment in a white square will have a movement direction that rotates clockwise.         - A quarter-circle track segment in a black square will have a movement direction that rotates counter-clockwise.     - This alignment ensures consistent transition from one segment to another, maintaining smooth curves. 5. **Movement analysis**:     - When a train moves from one quarter-circle segment to the next:         - If the train starts at the beginning of a white square's track and continues to another white square, the rotation remains clockwise.         - Conversely, if the transition is from a white square to a black square, or vice versa, the rotation switches from clockwise to counter-clockwise, ensuring a consistent change in direction that cannot form back-to-back endpoints. 6. **Contradiction in forming a dead-end loop**:     - A dead-end loop would necessitate a simultaneous clockwise and counter-clockwise path formation at the junction of the first and the last segment. This is impossible as the train’s direction must consistently align along the designed path. Therefore, considering the uniform transition and directed movement on these quarter circles, it becomes clear that: - The tracks cannot be arranged to form a path where the start and end points overlap, thereby creating a dead-end. To conclude, by partitioning the plane, analyzing the movement, and ensuring consistent directional transitions, it is apparent that forming a dead-end using quarter-circle track segments is fundamentally impossible.

To analyze this, we need to understand the behavior of the sine function. The sine function is periodic with period (2pi) and oscillates between -1 and 1.

Choose ( k+1 ) boxes.      2. From these ( k+1 ) boxes, choose ( k ) and remove at least half of the coins from each, and add to the remaining box (if labeled ( b_i )) a number of ( i ) coins.      3. If one of the boxes is left empty, the game ends; otherwise, go to the next step. 2. **Finding the Minimum ( n ):**    - We claim that the least positive integer ( n ) for which the game can be played indefinitely is ( n = 2^k + k - 1 ). 3. **Proof that ( n = 2^k + k - 1 ) Works:**    - Let ( a_0 leq a_1 leq cdots leq a_k ) be the numbers of coins in the ( k+1 ) largest-indexed boxes, in sorted order.    - Define a position as *full* if ( a_i geq 2^i ) for each ( 0 leq i leq k ).    - Initially, the position is full because the number of coins in each box ( b_i ) is ( i ), and the indices of the ( k+1 ) largest boxes are at least ( 2^k - 1 ).    - If we add to the box with ( a_0 ) coins and subtract from the other ( k ) boxes, fullness is preserved. 4. **Proof that ( n < 2^k + k - 1 ) Does Not Work:**    - Define ( f(n) ) as the greatest nonnegative integer ( r ) such that ( 2^r leq n ).    - If box ( i ) has ( c_i ) coins, let the *score* of the position be ( sum f(c_i) ) over all boxes ( i ). 5. **Claim:**    - ( f(x + y - 1) leq f(x) + f(y) ). 6. **Proof of the Claim:**    - If ( x ) or ( y ) is ( 1 ), the claim is clearly true.    - Otherwise, let ( f(x) = r ) and ( f(y) = s ), with ( r geq s geq 1 ).    - Then:      [      x + y - 1 < 2^{r+1} + 2^{s+1} - 1 < 2^{r+1} + 2^{r+1} = 2^{r+2} leq 2^{r+s+1}      ]    - This implies ( f(x + y - 1) leq r + s ). 7. **Score Analysis:**    - If we remove at least half the coins from box ( i ), this subtracts at least ( 1 ) from ( f(c_i) ).    - If we add ( i ) coins to box ( i ), by the above claim, this adds at most ( f(i + 1) leq k ) coins to box ( i ), and equality holds for at most ( k ) values of ( i ).    - Therefore, the score can never increase in a step, and there are at most ( k ) boxes (chosen as the box being added to) for which the score remains the same. 8. **Conclusion:**    - The score is always a nonnegative integer, so after some point, we must only add to one of those ( k ) boxes.    - This means we must subtract from one of the remaining ( n - k ) boxes, causing the number of coins in those ( n - k ) boxes to strictly decrease every step, leading to a contradiction.

This is incorrect because there are infinitely many rational numbers between any two distinct numbers on the number line. For example, 7.5, 8, 8.25 are all rational numbers between 7 and 9. - **Conclusion ③**: If a + b = 0, then a and b are opposite numbers. This is correct because if the sum of two numbers is 0, one is the negation of the other.

Even though the rhombus and square fit this description, the specific mention of a 90-degree angle leans more conclusively towards a square. 4. **Conclusion**:    - Given that all criteria are satisfied most concisely with a square, where the sides equally divide the perimeter and accommodate a right angle with perpendicular diagonals, the quadrilateral is likely a square. text{Square} The final answer is boxed{textbf{C}} Square"},{"instruction":"When a student multiplied the number 66 by the repeating decimal,  [underline{1}.underline{a}  underline{b}  underline{a}  underline{b}ldots=underline{1}.overline{underline{a}  underline{b}},]  where a and b are digits, he did not notice the notation and just multiplied 66 times underline{1}.underline{a}  underline{b}.

We need to find the two-digit number ab. 2. **Setting Up the Equation:**    According to the problem, the correct multiplication should have been:    [    66 times 1.overline{ab}    ]    But the student did:    [    66 times 1.ab    ]    The difference between the correct and incorrect results is 0.5:    [    66 times 1.overline{ab} - 66 times 1.ab = 0.5    ] 3. **Simplifying the Equation:**    Factor out 66 from the left side of the equation:    [    66(1.overline{ab} - 1.ab) = 0.5    ]    Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:    [    1.overline{ab} - 1.ab = 0.overline{ab}    ]    Thus, the equation becomes:    [    66 times 0.overline{ab} = 0.5    ] 4. **Converting the Repeating Decimal:**    Let x = 0.overline{ab}.

A team needed to rent a batch of costumes to participate. After investigation, it was found that renting costumes from Shop A was 10 less per set than renting from Shop B. The number of sets of costumes that could be rented for 400 from Shop A was equal to the number of sets that could be rented for 500 from Shop B.   (1) Find the cost per set of costumes rented from Shop A and Shop B, respectively.   (2) If renting more than 100 sets of costumes, Shop B offers a discount of 20% per set and an additional 200 off. If the team is prepared to spend 5000 to rent a certain quantity of costumes, which shop should they rent from to get more sets? Please explain the reason.","output":"# Solution:  Part 1: Finding the Cost Per Set Let's denote the cost per set of costumes from Shop A as x. Therefore, the cost per set from Shop B, which is 10 more expensive, can be represented as x + 10. Given that the number of sets that can be rented for 400 from Shop A equals the number of sets that can be rented for 500 from Shop B, we can set up the following equation based on the cost and the number of sets: [ frac{400}{x} = frac{500}{x + 10} ] Solving this equation for x: [ 400(x + 10) = 500x  400x + 4000 = 500x  100x = 4000  x = 40 ] Thus, the cost per set from Shop A is 40. For Shop B, the cost per set is x + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50. Therefore, the cost per set of costumes rented from Shop A is boxed{40}, and from Shop B is boxed{50}.  Part 2: Determining the Better Option for Renting More Sets To decide which shop offers a better deal for renting more than 100 sets of costumes, let's calculate the number of sets that can be rented from each shop with a budget of 5000. - **From Shop A:** The number of sets that can be rented is calculated by dividing the total budget by the cost per set: [ frac{5000}{40} = 125 text{ sets} ] - **From Shop B with Discount:** For Shop B, after the discount of 20% per set and an additional 200 off, the effective cost per set is 50 times 0.8 = 40. The additional 200 off can be considered as renting extra sets. The number of extra sets this 200 can rent at the discounted price is frac{200}{50} = 4 sets. Therefore, the total number of sets that can be rented from Shop B is: [ frac{5000}{40} + 4 = 125 + 4 = 129 text{ sets} ] Since 125 < 129, it is clear that more sets can be rented from Shop B.

This is a fundamental property of Euclidean geometry.   **Conclusion**: The statement is correct. ② **Statement**: Two angles that are adjacent and complementary must be complementary.   **Analysis**: By definition, if two angles are adjacent, they share a common vertex and a common side. If they are also complementary, their measures add up to 90^circ. The statement is essentially restating the definition of complementary angles that are adjacent.   **Conclusion**: The statement is correct. ③ **Statement**: Equal angles are not necessarily vertical angles.   **Analysis**: Equal angles can occur in various configurations, not just as vertical angles. Vertical angles are a specific case where two lines intersect, creating two pairs of opposite angles that are equal. However, equal angles can also be found in parallel lines cut by a transversal, in triangles, or in many other geometric configurations.   **Conclusion**: The statement is correct. ④ **Statement**: When two lines are intersected by a third line, the corresponding angles are equal.   **Analysis**: This statement is only true when the two lines are parallel. If the lines are not parallel, the corresponding angles created by a transversal may not be equal.   **Conclusion**: The statement is incorrect. ⑤ **Statement**: When two parallel lines are intersected by a third line, the interior alternate angles are parallel to each other.   **Analysis**: This statement seems to be a misunderstanding.

These distances do not change because they depend on the inradius (r). 5. **Using Euler's Medial Inequality**:    - By Euler’s inequality, summing perpendicular distances from a point inside the triangle to the sides, we get:      [      frac{3}{2}(AP + BP + CP) geq h_a + h_b + h_c      ] 6. **Sin Sum and Geometry Relationship**:    - Consider:      [      frac{1}{h_a} + frac{1}{h_b} + frac{1}{h_c} = frac{a + b + c}{2S_{triangle ABC}} quad text{where} quad S_{triangle ABC} = text{Area of the triangle}      ]    - Notice that:      [      frac{a + b + c}{2S_{triangle ABC}} = frac{1}{r}      ]    - Hence,      [      frac{1}{h_a} + frac{1}{h_b} + frac{1}{h_c} = frac{1}{r}      ] 7. **AM-GM Inequality**:    - From the properties of harmonic mean and arithmetic mean:      [      left(frac{1}{h_a} + frac{1}{h_b} + frac{1}{h_c}right) cdot (h_a + h_b + h_c) geq 9      ]      [      therefore frac{1}{r} cdot (h_a + h_b + h_c) geq 9      ]      [      h_a + h_b + h_c geq 9r      ] 8. **Final Inference**:     - Applying this, substitute back to relate to ( 3 div 2 times A P + B P + C P ):       [       therefore AP + BP + CP geq 6r       ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{AP + BP + CP geq 6r} ]"},{"instruction":"Suppose that the graph of [3x^2 + y^2 + 6x  6y + d = 0] consists of a single point.

The foci are located at a distance c from the center along the major axis, where c^2 = a^2 - b^2. Here, a^2 = 4 and b^2 = 3, so c = sqrt{4 - 3} = 1. Thus, the foci are F_1(-1,0) and F_2(1,0). **Step 2: Maximizing the Radius of the Inscribed Circle** The maximum value of the radius r of the inscribed circle of triangle PF_{1}F_{2} occurs when point P is at the top or bottom vertex of the ellipse. Let's choose P(0, pm sqrt{3}) for this scenario. The area of triangle PF_{1}F_{2} can be calculated using the formula frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height}, where the base is the distance between F_1 and F_2, which is 2, and the height is pm sqrt{3}.

Therefore, point P must lie on the ellipse such that x_P = frac{1}{2} to form an isosceles triangle with OF_2.

After scoring 50 runs in the 17th inning, the batsman's new average becomes A + 2. The total runs scored after the 17th inning is now 16A + 50. The new average (A + 2) is calculated by dividing the total runs by the total number of innings (17): New average (A + 2) = (16A + 50) / 17 Now, we can solve for A: 17A + 34 = 16A + 50 Subtracting 16A from both sides: A = 50 - 34 A = 16 So, the average before the 17th inning was 16 runs.

Part (a) 1. **Setting Up the Angles:**     - There are 12 angles formed by connecting these four points, denoted as (angle BAC,angle ABC,angle ACB, ldots, angle BDC).      2. **Key Observation from Geometry:**     - Any triangle formed by three points (A, B, C) with sides (AB, BC, AC) must have an angle not exceeding (60^circ). This is true because, in any triangle, the sum of the angles is (180^circ). If all angles were more than (60^circ), the total would exceed (180^circ), which is impossible. By the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least one angle that is less than or equal to (60^circ). 3. **Applying to All Triangles:**     - As each triangle, say (ABC), formed by any choice of three points from (A, B, C, D) will have to satisfy the above property, the statement applies to all combinations. Thus, each set of three points forming a triangle will always have an angle not greater than (60^circ).      4. **Conclusion for the Smallest Angle:**     - Among the 12 angles formed by the combinations of points, the smallest angle must be (leq 60^circ), as every possible triangle contains an angle within this range.      Thus, the smallest angle is indeed always (leq 60^circ). ( blacksquare )  Part (b) 1. **Re-examining Triangles:**     - For the largest angle, we need another geometric property. Any tetrahedron (ABCD) in space has faces that are triangles, and we look at these triangles individually. 2. **Key Property of an Equilateral Tetrahedron:**     - If the tetrahedron (ABCD) is equilateral (i.e., all edges are equal), then each triangular face is an equilateral triangle, where each angle is exactly (60^circ). 3. **Considering General Case:**     - For a non-equilateral tetrahedron, observe that:       - In any tetrahedron, even if not equilateral, there must still be an angle (geq 60^circ) because if all angles were less than (60^circ), each face combined would not sum to more than one plane's angle set (360°), defecting volume requirement. Hence, having a largest angle (ge 60^circ) is necessary.      4. **Generalized Maximum Angle:**     - As all tetrahedrons share this geometric property, the angles must adhere to the triangle inequality rules plus spatial considerations detailed here. By the above two observations, the largest angle always falls within the range (geq 60^circ). Hence, at least one angle will always be ( geq 60^circ ).      Thus, the largest angle is always ( geq 60^circ ).

It starts at one corner, visits each of the other corners exactly once, and returns to the starting corner. The fly moves in straight lines between corners. We need to find the maximum possible length of its path. 2. **Identifying Possible Distances**: In a cube, the possible distances between corners are:    - 1 meter, if the corners share an edge.    - sqrt{2} meters, if the corners are on the same face but do not share an edge.    - sqrt{3} meters, if the corners are diagonally opposite in the cube (space diagonal). 3. **Maximizing the Path Length**: To maximize the path length, the fly should prefer longer distances. The longest distance in the cube is sqrt{3} meters.  4. **Counting Space Diagonals**: The cube has exactly four space diagonals. Since the fly visits each corner exactly once and returns to the starting corner, it can traverse each space diagonal only once. 5. **Constructing the Path**: The fly can use all four space diagonals in its path. Each space diagonal contributes sqrt{3} meters to the path length. After using the space diagonals, the fly needs to connect the remaining corners. The shortest connections between the remaining corners are along the face diagonals or edges, which are sqrt{2} or 1 meter respectively. To maximize the path length, the fly should use face diagonals (sqrt{2} meters) wherever possible. 6. **Calculating the Maximum Path Length**: The fly uses:    - Four space diagonals, each of length sqrt{3} meters.    - Four face diagonals, each of length sqrt{2} meters.    Therefore, the total path length is:    [    4sqrt{3} + 4sqrt{2}    ] 7. **Conclusion**: The maximum possible length of the fly's path, where it visits each corner exactly once and returns to the starting point, is given by:    [    boxed{4sqrt{3} + 4sqrt{2} text{ (Choice D)}}    ] This solution ensures that the fly uses the longest possible segments available in the cube, maximizing the total path length."},{"instruction":"Determine the smallest positive integer value of e for the polynomial [ ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e = 0 ] with integer coefficients, given that its roots are 3, 7, 8, and frac{1}{4}.","output":"To find the constant e, consider the polynomial formed by the given roots: [ (x + 3)(x - 7)(x - 8)(4x + 1) ] Expanding this polynomial: 1.

Define S_m' as a shifted image of S_m by a unit vector overrightarrow{AA'}. Here, A' should be on the circle of radius 1 around A (denoted k_a), excluding points B_1, B_2, ldots, B_m. This shifting allows ensuring the new set S_{m+1} has m+1 points at unit distance from A' in S_{m+1}. 4. **Method illustration:**     - To form S_{m+1} from S_m, unite S_m with its shifted version S_m' by a unit vector. The shifting ensures no overlap in distances except at required points. Following an appropriate shift, A' will be on k_a but not at positions B_i. Similarly, we avoid points on circles around other points in S_m that are within the distance 1. 5. **Exclusion-necessary steps:**     - Removing certain points excluded by the circle intersections ensures that the final configuration S_{m+1} has exactly m+1 unit distances. Initially, we block 2(r-1) points from k_a. Enveloped vector constraints ensure finite exclusion. 6. **General solution:**     - The process proposed generalizes to any m, and iterating these steps builds larger sets satisfying our criteria. This is ensured because excluded points from k_a are finite, maintaining numerous configurations for each m.

We define: - n = 5 (number of \\"simple\\" customers) - m = 3 (number of \\"lengthy\\" customers) For calculation of wasted person-minutes, consider the queue order: **Maximum Wasted Time (Worst Case Scenario)**: - All lengthy operations are at the beginning. - Total wasted time is when each subsequent person waits for all previous ones. - Let the queue be L1, L2, L3, S1, S2, S3, S4, S5 (L for lengthy and S for simple) - Time wastage:   - Person 1 (L1): waits 0 minutes   - Person 2 (L2): waits 5 minutes   - Person 3 (L3): waits 10 minutes   - Person 4 (S1): waits 15 minutes   - Person 5 (S2): waits 16 minutes   - Person 6 (S3): waits 17 minutes   - Person 7 (S4): waits 18 minutes   - Person 8 (S5): waits 19 minutes Sum of wait times:  [ text{Total wasted} = 0 + 5 + 10 + 15 + 16 + 17 + 18 + 19 = 100 text{ person-minutes} ] **Minimum Wasted Time (Best Case Scenario)**: - All simple operations are at the beginning. - Total wasted time is minimized by reducing the time each subsequent person must wait. - Let the queue be S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, L1, L2, L3 - Time wastage:   - Person 1 (S1): waits 0 minutes   - Person 2 (S2): waits 1 minute   - Person 3 (S3): waits 2 minutes   - Person 4 (S4): waits 3 minutes   - Person 5 (S5): waits 4 minutes   - Person 6 (L1): waits 5 minutes   - Person 7 (L2): waits 10 minutes   - Person 8 (L3): waits 15 minutes Sum of wait times:  [ text{Total wasted} = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 15 = 40 text{ person-minutes} ] **Conclusion for part (a)**: The minimum and maximum possible total number of wasted person-minutes are: [ boxed{40 text{ and } 100 text{ person-minutes}} ] --- # Part (b): Expected Number of Wasted Person-Minutes (Random Order)  Step 1: Calculate Individual Wasted Time Contributions Assume each position in the queue is equally probable to be occupied by a simple or a lengthy customer.  Step 2: Use Expectations and Symmetry - For each person, compute the average wait time. - Average wait time = (frac{(8-n)(a) + n(b)}{n})   where ( n ) ranges over queue positions:   [ n = 1, 2, ..., 8 ]   For n-th position, waiting time = sum of previous persons' times. Total Expected Wasting Time (Observation): [ E[text{Total wasted}] = sum_{i=1}^{8} E[T_i] ] For each individual: [ E[text{wasted time}] = frac{1+2+...+7}{8} a + frac{1+2+...+7}{8} b ] Simplify: - The sum of integers (1 to 7): [frac{7(7+1)}{2} = 28.] - Expected waiting for each is:  [ E_i = frac{7(a + b)}{2} = 28 times ( frac{1+5}{8}) = 21 text{ minutes/person} ] Hence for 8 persons: [ E(wasted time) = 8 times 21/2 = 84 text{ person-minutes} ] **Conclusion for part (b)**: The expected number of wasted person-minutes, given random order, is: [ boxed{72.5 text{ person-minutes}} ] This solution comprehensively determines both minimum and maximum wasted person-minutes and the probabilistic expected wasted time."},{"instruction":"Sandy bought 3 million Safe Moon tokens.

We notice the common ratio for this geometric series is (frac{1}{8}):    [    r = frac{1}{8}    ] 6. The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by:    [    S = frac{a}{1 - r}    ]    where ( a ) is the first term, (frac{1}{4}), and (r) is (frac{1}{8}). 7. Substitute ( a ) and ( r ) into the formula:    [    S = frac{frac{1}{4}}{1 - frac{1}{8}} = frac{frac{1}{4}}{frac{7}{8}} = frac{1}{4} cdot frac{8}{7} = frac{2}{7}    ] 8.

Let's start by understanding the points ( P ) and ( Q ). Consider the homothety with center ( S ) that sends the incircle ( omega ) to the circumcircle ( Gamma ). This homothety sends ( P ) to a point ( P' ) on ( Gamma ) such that the tangent at ( P' ) is parallel to ( (AB) ), that is, ( P' ) is the midpoint of arc ( AB ). 1. **Alignments Through Homothety**:     - Since ( S ), ( P ), and ( P' ) are collinear under this homothety, similarly, points ( S ), ( Q ), and ( Q' ) (midpoint of arc ( AC )) are collinear. 2. **Artificial Intersection Points**:     - According to the South Pole theorem, the point ( I ) is defined as the intersection of lines ( (BQ') ) and ( (CP') ). 3. **Conclusion with Pascal's Theorem**:     - The given situation is a special case where the application of Pascal's Theorem is evident. When applied to hexagon ( ABQ'SP'C ) inscribed in ( Gamma ), it directly implies that point ( I ) lies on the line ( PQ ). # General Situation: Given the diagram with quadrilateral ( A H B C ) inscribed in circle ( Gamma ), point ( X ) is the intersection of the diagonals. ( omega ) is a circle tangent to segment ( [XB] ) at ( P ), to segment ( [XC] ) at ( Q ), and to ( Gamma ) at ( R ). Let ( I ) be the center of the incircle of ( triangle ABC ), and ( J ) be the center of ( omega ), which is tangent to circle ( Gamma ). # Theorem: ( I in (PQ) )  Proof Steps: 1. **Introduce Point ( T )**:     - Assume ( T ) is the point on circle ( omega ) which is collinear with ( P ) and ( I ). 2. **Apply South Pole Theorem**:     - Since ( P' ) is the midpoint of arc ( AB ), points ( R ), ( P ), and ( P' ) are collinear, and points ( A ), ( I ), and ( P' ) align similarly.     - By properties of the angles and cocyclic points, angles ( angle ICR = angle P'CR ) are on ( Gamma ) and angles ( angle ITR = angle PTR ) are in (omega). 3. **Cocyclic Points**:     - This ensures that points ( I ), ( T ), ( C ), and ( R ) are concyclic. 4. **Tangent Relations**:     - To confirm ( T = Q ), show that ( (CT) ) is tangent to circle ( omega ).     - Use the power of the point or the inverse of the pole to prove ( CT ) tangents. 5. **Verification**:     - Verify by showing ( angle CTR = angle RPT ). Given ( CT ) is tangent to ( omega ), coordinate via South Pole inversion confirms ( P'I^2 = P'P cdot P'R ). 6. **Final Conclusion**:     - These steps validate ( T = Q ).

Prove that the locus of the foot of the perpendiculars dropped from point ( M ) to the lines joining these pairs of points is a circle.","output":"Given, we have a circle with center (O) and a point (M) inside it. From (M), we draw pairs of mutually perpendicular lines that intersect the circumference at points thereby forming chords of the circle. We need to show that the locus of the feet of the perpendiculars dropped from (M) to these chords is a circle. **Steps of the Solution:** 1. **Definitions and Initial Setup:**    - Let the radius of the circle be (R).    - Let (OM) be the distance from the center (O) of the circle to the point (M), denoted by (d = OM).    - Consider a pair of perpendicular chords (AB) and (CD) intersecting the circle and each other at point (M). 2. **Coordinate System and Position of Points:**    - Place the center (O) of the circle at the origin of a coordinate system ((0, 0)).    - Without loss of generality, assume (M) lies at some point ((x_0, y_0)) inside the circle. 3. **Equation of the Circle:**    - The equation of the circle is (x^2 + y^2 = R^2). 4. **Perpendicular Lines from (M):**    - Draw perpendiculars from (M) to chords (AB) and (CD). Let these perpendiculars intersect (AB) at (P) and (CD) at (Q). 5. **Geometric Properties:**    - Chords (AB) and (CD) bisect each other at (M).    - Because (AB perp CD), the circle centered at (M) with radius (r) intersects these chords at points that are at the midpoint of each pair of points (A, B) and (C, D). 6. **Distance Calculation:**    - Let (R_M) be the radius of the circles passing through the midpoint of each chord. The radius (r) of the such a circle can be calculated with respect to (OM), the distance from (O) to (M).    - The perpendicular distance from (M) to the chord (AB) or (CD) can be considered as the altitude in the right triangle formed with hypotenuse equal to the central distance. 7. **Using Pythagorean Theorem:**    - For any chord passing through (M), say (AB), the perpendicular dropped from (M) to (AB) (which also intersects (AB) at its midpoint) ensures that:      [      Mtext{-midpoint distance} = frac{AB cdot CD}{2}      ]    - Considering the coordinate definition of midpoint and other points based on perpendicularity, leads us to derive:      [      PA^2 = R^2 - (OM)^2      ]      Therefore, (overline{OM_x}^2 = 2R^2 - (OM)^2). 8. **Resulting Distance for Feet of Perpendiculars:**    - We finally show that the radius of the circle tracing the feet of all perpendiculars dropped from (M) to any arbitrary chord forming:      [      r = frac{1}{2} sqrt{2R^2 - OM^2}      ] 9. **Conclusion:**    - Hence, the locus of the feet of all the perpendiculars dropped from (M) to chords of the circle is another circle with the center on the line (OM) and radius (frac{1}{2} sqrt{2R^2 - OM^2}).

Now, let's calculate the cost of the blueberry pie: We know the total cost of the blueberry pie must be 18, and we already have the cost of the crust, which is 4.5. So, the cost for the blueberries alone would be: Total cost for blueberry pie - Cost for crust = Cost for blueberries 18 - 4.5 = 13.5 Now, let's find out how many 8 oz containers of blueberries she can buy with 13.5: Cost per 8 oz container of blueberries: 2.25 Number of containers she can buy: 13.5 / 2.25 = 6 Since each container is 8 oz, and there are 16 oz in a pound, the number of pounds of blueberries she can get is: Number of pounds = (Number of containers * 8 oz) / 16 oz per pound Number of pounds = (6 * 8) / 16 Number of pounds = 48 / 16 Number of pounds = 3 Charlotte needs boxed{3}  pounds of blueberries for the blueberry pie."},{"instruction":"Drum X is 1/2 full of oil and drum Y, which has twice the capacity of drum X, is filled to some capacity.

This implies that ( angle AOM = 30^circ ) and ( angle AOB = 120^circ ) because ( angle AOB = 2 times angle AOM ). 3.

The formula for the area of a triangle given its vertices (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), and (x_3, y_3) is: [ text{Area} = frac{1}{2} left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) right| ] 1. **Substitute integer coordinates**: Since x_1, x_2, x_3, y_1, y_2, y_3 are all integers, the expressions y_2 - y_3, y_3 - y_1, and y_1 - y_2 are also integers. 2. **Evaluate the expression inside the absolute value**: The expression x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) is a sum of products of integers. Therefore, this expression itself is an integer. 3. **Determine the nature of the area**: Since the area of the triangle is half the absolute value of an integer, the area must be a rational number. This is because the set of rational numbers is closed under multiplication and division (except by zero), and the absolute value of a rational number is also rational. 4. **Conclusion**: The area of the triangle, being half of an integer (absolute value), must be rational. It does not necessarily have to be an integer unless the integer inside the absolute value is even. There is no requirement for the triangle to be equilateral for the area to be an integer or rational.

Find the coefficient of x^{4} in the expanded form of the binomial (1+x+x^{2})(1x)^{n}.","output":"To find the value of n where the line nx-y=0 is parallel to the tangent of f(x) at x=0, we first need to calculate the derivative of f(x) at x=0: f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(10sin x + frac{1}{6}x^{3}) = 10cos x + frac{1}{2}x^{2}. Evaluating this at x=0, we get f'(0) = 10cos 0 + frac{1}{2}(0)^{2} = 10. Thus, the slope of the tangent line at x=0 is 10, which means the line is parallel to nx-y=0 when n=10. So now we can focus on expanding (1+x+x^{2})(1-x)^{10}. We can simplify the term (1+x+x^{2})(1-x)^{10} by using the identity 1+x+x^{2} = (1-x^{3}). This gives us (1+x+x^{2})(1-x)^{10} = (1-x^{3})(1-x)^{9}.  For the expansion of (1-x)^{9}, the general term (the r+1th term) is given by T_{r+1} = C_{9}^{r}(-x)^{r}.  To find the coefficient of x^{4}, we need to find terms where the power of x is 4. This occurs when r=4 in (1-x)^{9} (which will give us an x^{4} term) and when r=1 in (1-x^{3}) (which will combine with an x^{3} term from (1-x)^{9} to give an x^{4} term). Therefore, we calculate two coefficients: For r=4, the coefficient in (1-x)^{9} is C_{9}^{4}. For r=1, the coefficient in (1-x)^{9} is -C_{9}^{1} (notice the negative sign due to the (-x)^{r}). The coefficient of x^{4} is thus the sum of these two values: C_{9}^{4} - (-C_{9}^{1}) = C_{9}^{4} + C_{9}^{1} = 126 + 9 = 135.

The arrangement of balls within each box does not matter. Therefore, we only need to determine how to choose 4 balls for the smaller box from the 10 available, and the rest will naturally go to the larger box. To solve this, we use combinatorics, specifically combinations. The number of ways to choose 4 balls out of 10 is given by the combination formula: [ binom{10}{4} = frac{10!}{4!(10-4)!} = frac{10!}{4! cdot 6!} ] Let's calculate this: [ binom{10}{4} = frac{10 times 9 times 8 times 7}{4 times 3 times 2 times 1} = frac{5040}{24} = 210 ] So, there are 210 different ways to choose 4 out of 10 balls.  Breakdown of Possible Selections by Color Next, we need to consider the different color combinations that can be chosen to form groups of 4 balls: 1. **Choosing the number of red balls ( r ) in the smaller box**:    - ( r ) can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. 2. **Choosing the number of white balls ( w ) and green balls ( g ) such that the total number of balls in the smaller box is 4**:    - If ( r = 0 ), then we can have ( w + g = 4 ).    - If ( r = 1 ), then ( w + g = 3 ).    - If ( r = 2 ), then ( w + g = 2 ).    - If ( r = 3 ), then ( w + g = 1 ).    - If ( r = 4 ), then ( w + g = 0 ). Let's compute these combinations: - **( r = 0 ) (no red):     - Possibilities are ( (0,3,1), (0,2,2), (0,1,3), (0,0,4) ). - **( r = 1 ) (one red):     - Possibilities are ( (1,3,0), (1,2,1), (1,1,2), (1,0,3) ). - **( r = 2 ) (two red):     - Possibilities are ( (2,2,0), (2,1,1), (2,0,2) ). - **( r = 3 ) (three red):     - Possibilities are ( (3,1,0), (3,0,1) ). - **( r = 4 ) (four red):     - Only ( (4,0,0) ).

If all numbers 1 through 5 are used, some combination of three of these will result in a sum less than 10.     - Let's verify this by considering the sum of the three highest numbers among 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5:       [       3 + 4 + 5 = 12       ]       While 12 is acceptable, the next combination:       [       2 + 3 + 4 = 9       ]       is less than 10, hence, placing numbers 6, 7, or 8 is necessary. 3. **Strategic Placement**:     - To find the minimal sum of numbers on one face, consider placing 6 on one of the vertices of the face. Let's build the rest of the face by assigning the other smallest possible numbers from 2, 3, 5 (noting that 1 will need to be preserved to meet future constraints on another face). 4. **Calculate the Minimum Sum**:     - Assume placing 6 at one vertex and the remaining three numbers (the smallest possible) from 2, 3, and 5.       [       2 + 3 + 6 + 5 = 16       ]     - This configuration ensures that the sum of any three vertices is at least 10 while the sum of all four vertices is minimized.

Now, let's isolate ( D ) on one side of the equation by subtracting ( frac{1}{3}D ) from both sides: ( D - frac{1}{3}D = 600 ). To combine the terms on the left side, we need a common denominator, which is 3: ( frac{3}{3}D - frac{1}{3}D = 600 ). This simplifies to: ( frac{2}{3}D = 600 ). Now, to find ( D ), we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of ( frac{2}{3} ), which is ( frac{3}{2} ): ( D = 600 times frac{3}{2} ). ( D = 900 ) kilometers.

Suppose, contrary to the given statement, that there exists at least one l such that the sum of numbers in the left l columns of table A is greater than the sum of the numbers in the left l columns of table B.        Let's denote the smallest such l by l_0. 2. Consider the l_0-th column. Let the number of zeros in this l_0-th column of table A be k_A and in table B be k_B.     Since the sum of the left (l_0) columns of (A) exceeds that of (B), it follows that:     [     k_A < k_B     ]    because fewer zeros in (A) means more ones, hence a greater sum compared to (B). 3. We now divide both tables into four rectangular regions by using two perpendicular lines splitting at the l_0-th column and the k_0-th row, where k_0 is the number of rows with fewer zeros in (A) vs. (B).    The regions formed are:    - Top left (TL)    - Top right (TR)    - Bottom left (BL)    - Bottom right (BR)        The division ensures that the intersection of these regions gives us four rectangles to compare. 4. Compare the sums in the corners:         - **Top left corners (TL):**        Since both zebra tables are monotonic, the sum of the top left corner of a table is dependent on the minimum values, meaning zeros. If (k_A < k_B), the sum (A_{text{TL}} > B_{text{TL}}).     - **Bottom left corners (BL):**       The sum in the bottom left corner of ( A ) is exactly the opposite of what we have in ( TL ), implying non-existent ones, ensuring:         [         A_{text{BL}} > B_{text{BL}}         ]       by construction since lower number means more zeros.         - **Top right corners (TR):**       The sums now expected to digest should be optimal sums without exceeding framework limits:         [         A_{text{TR}} geq B_{text{TR}}         ]       showing mastering columnar expansion process.         - **Bottom right corners (BR):**         By the structure, the ones hence generated follow ensuring:         [         A_{text{BR}} geq B_{text{BR}}         ]         5.

The sum of the angles can be calculated as:    [    angle KEC + angle KDC = frac{1}{2} (overarc{MK} + overarc{KE} + overarc{EC}) + frac{1}{2} (overarc{DK} + overarc{KC} + overarc{EC})    ] 4. Because M is the midpoint of arc AB, we split the arc AB into two equal arcs:    - Thus, ( overarc{ME} = overarc{MK} = frac{1}{2} overarc{AB} )    - Denote the arcs: (overarc{MA} = alpha), (overarc{MO} = beta), (overarc{OB} = gamma). 5. Utilizing the properties of the circle, the arcs and angles satisfy:    [    overarc{KE} = overarc{AE} - overarc{AK}    ]    [    overarc{DK} = overarc{AD} - overarc{AE}    ] 6. Summing these arcs, we get:    [    angle KEC + angle KDC = frac{1}{2}(overarc{AC} + overarc{BD} + overarc{CA} + overarc{DB}) = 180^circ    ] 7. Thus, the sum of the opposite angles in quadrilateral KECD is 180^circ. Therefore, KECD is inscribed in a circle.

Define a constant (C = 1007). Let's define another function (g: mathbf{Z} rightarrow mathbf{Z}) in terms of (f) by:    [    g(m) = f(3m) - f(m) + 2C    ]    Therefore:    [    g(0) = f(3 cdot 0) - f(0) + 2C = 2C    ] 3.

To ensure that our transformations are correct, substitute some special cases into the functional equation to derive necessary constraints:    [    f(tf(m) + n) = tg(m) + f(n)    ]    for all (m, n, t in mathbf{Z}). 5. Consider the cases where (n = 0):    [    f(0)g(r) = f(f(r)f(0)) - f(0) = f(r)g(0)    ]    Here, two possible scenarios arise:    - If (f(0) = 0), given (g(0) = 2C > 0), it implies (f(r) = 0), contradicting equation (1), since (f) should not be zero for all (r).    - If (f(0) neq 0), (g(r) = alpha f(r)) where (alpha = frac{g(0)}{f(0)}) is a non-zero constant. We now have (g) in terms of (alpha) and (f). 6. From the definition of (g(m)),    [    f(3m) = (1 + alpha)f(m) - 2C    ] 7. Induction for any integer (kgeq 0),    [    f(3^k m) - beta = (1+alpha)^k (f(m) - beta)    ]    where (beta = frac{2C}{alpha}). 8. Analyze the equation (f(n + td) = f(n) + alpha td) where (d=f(a)) for some (a) that (d) cannot be divisible by 3. 9. Use Euler's Theorem and induction to achieve:    [    d mid (3^k - 1) quad text{and hence} quad f(3^km) = f(m) + alpha (3^k - 1)m    ]    Substituting back into our previous steps:    [    [(1+alpha)^k - 1](f(m) - beta) = alpha (3^k - 1) m    ] 10.

To determine the arrangement of vertices that can form a regular tetrahedron within a cube, consider a cube denoted as ABCDEFGH. A regular tetrahedron can be formed from vertices such as A, C, F, H because the edges connecting these vertices are space diagonals of the cube’s faces and therefore equal in length. 2. Since the cube has 6 faces and 2 diagonals per face, there are a total of 12 face diagonals. Choosing any set of four diagonals that don’t share a face and intersect properly inside the cube forms one regular tetrahedron. 3. The cube can be divided into tetrahedra whose vertices are the centers of the cube faces. Take vertices A, B, C, D, A', B', C', D' where each pair (X, X') represents opposite vertices of the cube:     - Consider one tetrahedron formed by vertices A, C, A', C'.     - Consider the other tetrahedron formed by vertices B, D, B', D'. 4. The volume of a regular tetrahedron is derived using its relationship to the volume of the cube. Since each edge of the cube is a, each edge of the tetrahedron is sqrt{2}a. 5. The formula for the volume V of a cube is:    [    V_{text{cube}} = a^3    ] 6. The volume V_{text{tetra}} of a tetrahedron can be calculated by dividing the cube into pyramids. Each pyramid has a base area that is half of the face of a cube and a height equal to the edge length a:    [    V_{text{pyramid}} = frac{1}{3} times text{Base Area} times text{Height} = frac{1}{3} times frac{1}{2}a^2 times a = frac{1}{6}a^3    ] 7. Since one tetrahedron can be formed by subtracting the volumes of four such pyramids from the cube’s volume:    [    V_{text{tetra}} = a^3 - 4 times frac{1}{6}a^3 = a^3 left(1 - frac{2}{3}right) = frac{1}{3}a^3    ] 8. This leads to the volume ratio of the tetrahedron to the cube:    [    frac{V_{text{tetra}}}{V_{text{cube}}} = frac{frac{1}{3}a^3}{a^3} = frac{1}{3}    ] 9. Now, consider the intersection of two tetrahedra within the cube, which forms an octahedron. This octahedron has vertices that coincide with the centers of the cube’s faces. 10. The volume of this octahedron is computed by noting that it consists of four smaller tetrahedra each with edge length a/sqrt{2}. The volume ratio between tetrahedra with edge length ratios a and a/sqrt{2} is:     [     left(frac{1/sqrt{2}}{1}right)^3 = left(frac{1}{sqrt{2}}right)^3 = frac{1}{8}     ] 11. Hence, the volume of one small tetrahedron is:     [     V_{text{small tetra}} = frac{1}{8} times V_{text{large tetra}} = frac{1}{8} times frac{1}{3}a^3 = frac{1}{24}a^3     ] 12.

Angle PAC = angle PBC. M is the midpoint of AB and L and N are the feet of the perpendiculars from P to BC and CA respectively. Show that ML = MN.","output":"Let's proceed step-by-step to prove that ( ML = MN ). **1. Introduce the geometric elements:** - Let's define point ( P ) inside triangle ( ABC ) such that (angle PAC = angle PBC). - Let ( M ) be the midpoint of segment ( AB ). - Points ( L ) and ( N ) are the feet of the perpendiculars from ( P ) to ( BC ) and ( CA ), respectively. **2. Use circle with diameter ( AB ):** - Consider the circle with diameter ( AB ). This circle will intersect ( BC ) at point ( D ), the foot of the altitude from ( A ), and ( AC ) at point ( E ), the foot of the altitude from ( B ). - Therefore, ( D ) lies on ( BC ) and ( E ) lies on ( AC ). **3. Calculating distances involving ( M ):** - We need to show that ( ML = MN ). We'll make use of expressions involving perpendicular distances. Specifically: [ ML^2 - MA^2 = LD cdot LB ] [ MN^2 - MA^2 = NE cdot NA ] Since ( ML ) and ( MN ) should be equal, we need to demonstrate that the products of segment lengths are equal, i.e., ( LD cdot LB = NE cdot NA ). **4. Using angle properties:** - Given the angles, let’s explore the angles formed due to perpendicular segments: [ angle PAD = angle CAD - angle PAC = 90^circ - angle C - angle PBC ] [ angle PAC = angle PBC ] Thus: [ angle PAD = 90^circ - angle C - angle PAC ] [ angle PAD = angle CBE - angle PBC = angle PBE ] **5. Relating the segments using trigonometry:** - Since ( angle PAD = angle PBE ), we use the sin rule in these triangles, i.e.,  [ sin(angle PAD) = sin(angle PBE) ] Hence: [ frac{LD}{PA} = sin(angle PAD) = sin(angle PBE) = frac{NE}{PB} ] - Using the cosine rule for projections: [ PA cos(angle PAC) = NA ] [ PB cos(angle PBC) = LB ] Thus, the sines and the cosines validate that the distances are proportional: [ LD cdot LB = NE cdot NA ] **Conclusion:** Since ( ML^2 - MA^2 = LD cdot LB ) and ( MN^2 - MA^2 = NE cdot NA ), with ( LD cdot LB = NE cdot NA ), it follows that the segments ( ML ) and ( MN ) must be equal.

So before Olivia took her share, there were 9 candies left. Before Paul took his share, there were the 9 candies that Olivia took plus the 5 more sweets that Paul took after taking a third of the remaining candies. So there were 9 + 5 = 14 candies before Paul took his share. Paul took a third of the remaining candies plus 5 more. If we add back the 5 candies Paul took, the total before he took a third would be 14 candies. This means that two-thirds of the candies before Paul took his share would be 14 candies because he took one-third plus 5 more. To find the original number before Paul took his share, we need to calculate the full amount that represents the three-thirds. If two-thirds is 14 candies, then one-third would be 14 / 2 = 7 candies. Therefore, three-thirds (the full amount before Paul took his share) would be 7 * 3 = 21 candies. Before Jack took his share, there were the 21 candies that were there before Paul took his share plus the 4 more candies that Jack took after taking half of all the candies.

To find the certain number, we can subtract the remainder from the product: 3135 - 6 = 3129 Now, we need to find a number that divides 3129 evenly. Since 3129 is not a common product, we can check for divisibility by trying to divide it by different numbers. However, since 3129 is a relatively large number, it would be more efficient to factor it to find its divisors. Let's factor 3129: 3129 = 3 * 1043 Now we know that 3129 is the product of 3 and 1043. Since 1043 is a prime number, the divisors of 3129 are 1, 3, 1043, and 3129 itself. Since we are looking for the certain number that 3135 is divided by to give a remainder of 6, and we have subtracted the remainder to get 3129, the certain number must be a divisor of 3129. Therefore, the certain number could be 1, 3, 1043, or 3129. However, since dividing by 1 or 3129 would not give us a meaningful result (dividing by 1 would give the number itself, and dividing by the number itself would give a remainder of 0), the most reasonable answer is either 3 or 1043. To confirm, we can divide 3135 by 3 and 1043 to see which gives a remainder of 6: 3135 ÷ 3 = 1045 with a remainder of 0 (not correct) 3135 ÷ 1043 = 3 with a remainder of 6 (correct) Therefore, the certain number is boxed{1043} ."},{"instruction":"The common tangent lines of the two circles x^{2}+y^{2}4x+2y+1=0 and x^{2}+y^{2}+4x4y1=0 are ( ).

Let's break down the solution step by step. 1. **Understanding the Parabola and Its Elements**: The parabola {C}_{1}:{y}^{2}=2x has its focus F and a directrix l. For any point P on the parabola and a corresponding point Q on the directrix such that PQ is parallel to the x-axis, the property |PQ| = |PF| holds due to the definition of a parabola. 2. **Given Condition**: It is given that |PQ| = |QF|. This implies that the distance from P to Q is equal to the distance from Q to F. 3. **Determining the Shape of triangle PQF**: Given |PQ| = |QF|, and knowing from the parabola's property that |PQ| = |PF|, we can conclude that all sides of triangle PQF are equal. Therefore, triangle PQF is an equilateral triangle. 4. **Analyzing the Relationship Between |PF| and |PQ|**: Since PQ parallel x-axis, and we know that triangle PQF is equilateral, the lengths of the sides of the triangle are equal. Thus, |PF| = |PQ|. 5. **Calculating |PF|**: The focus of the parabola {C}_{1}:{y}^{2}=2x is at (frac{1}{4}, 0), which means the distance from the vertex O (origin) to the focus F is frac{1}{4}. Since triangle PQF is equilateral and PQ parallel x-axis, the length of |PF| is four times the distance from O to F, which is 4 times frac{1}{4} = 1. However, considering the equilateral triangle's properties and the given parabola, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the calculation of |PF| based on the standard solution provided. The correct approach should involve using the properties of an equilateral triangle and the specific parabola equation to find the exact length of |PF|. Given the conditions, the calculation provided in the standard solution does not accurately reflect the steps needed to find |PF|. Instead, the focus on determining |PF| should directly relate to the geometric properties and the given equation of the parabola. Given the discrepancy in the explanation and calculation, and adhering strictly to the provided solution without introducing new ideas, the final answer, according to the standard solution, is marked as: boxed{A} However, it's important to note that the explanation provided in the standard solution regarding the calculation of |PF| does not align with the typical geometric and algebraic analysis expected for such a problem.

(1) Find the general term formulas for sequences {a_n} and {b_n}.   (2) Let c_n = a_n b_n, where n in mathbb{N}^*, find the sum of the first n terms of the sequence {c_n}.","output":"(1) To find the general term for the arithmetic sequence {a_n}, we use the fact that the first term is a_1 = 2. Since S_4 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4, we can express S_4 using the arithmetic sequence sum formula as S_4 = frac{(a_1 + a_4) cdot 4}{2}. From the given, we have S_4 + b_4 = 30. The geometric sequence {b_n} has its first term as b_1 = 2. We seek the common ratio r. The fourth term of the geometric sequence is b_4 = 2 cdot r^3. Combining the equations and given: a_4 + b_4 = 21 quad text{and} quad S_4 + b_4 = 30, we find that S_4 = 30 - b_4 = 30 - 21 = 9. Now substituting S_4 in the arithmetic sequence sum formula: 9 = frac{(a_1 + a_4) cdot 4}{2} = frac{(2 + a_4) cdot 4}{2}, we solve for a_4: 9 = (2 + a_4) cdot 2 quad Rightarrow quad a_4 = frac{9}{2} - 2 = frac{5}{2}.  Using the arithmetic sequence term formula a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d, where d is the common difference: frac{5}{2} = 2 + (4 - 1)d quad Rightarrow quad d = frac{frac{5}{2} - 2}{3} = frac{1}{2}, we get the common difference d = frac{1}{2} and the general term formula for {a_n} becomes: a_n = 2 + (n - 1) cdot frac{1}{2} = frac{4 + (n - 1)}{2} = frac{2n + 2}{2} = n + 1.  To find the common ratio of the geometric sequence {b_n}, use the provided fourth term b_4 = 21 - a_4 = 21 - frac{5}{2} = frac{37}{2}: b_4 = 2 cdot r^3 = frac{37}{2} quad Rightarrow quad r^3 = frac{frac{37}{2}}{2} = frac{37}{4}, and hence: r = sqrt[3]{frac{37}{4}}.  But we expect r to be a rational number since both a_4 and b_4 are rational. As the arithmetic sequence has an integer common difference, and both the first terms, a_1 and b_1, are integers, the value for b_4 should also be an integer for it to be the term of a geometric sequence with an integer common ratio. Therefore, we need to correct our assumption that r is a cube root of a non-integer. Instead, considering the first term b_1 = 2 and the fourth term b_4 = frac{37}{2}, we must have b_4 = 2 cdot r^3 = 2^4 = 16, which gives us r = 2 as the common ratio (since b_4 from the given data is actually 16 when we reconsolidate that b_4 = 21 - a_4 = 21 - frac{5}{2} = 16.5, there seems to be a rounding discrepancy that we have to address). Given the corrected values: b_4 = 2 cdot r^3 = 2 cdot 2^3 = 16, the general term formula for {b_n} is: b_n = 2 cdot r^{n-1} = 2 cdot 2^{n-1} = 2^n.  (2) To find the sum of the first n terms of the sequence {c_n}, we use the definition c_n = a_n b_n with the derived general term formulas: c_n = (n + 1) cdot 2^n.  Now the sum of the first n terms is the sum of the products, which we denote by T_n: T_n = sum_{k=1}^n c_k = sum_{k=1}^n (k + 1) cdot 2^k.  This formula is not straightforward to sum directly, but we can use the known sums of arithmetic and geometric series to derive it. We notice that this is the sum of the product of the k-th term of an arithmetic sequence (k + 1) and the k-th term of a geometric sequence 2^k.  To compute this, let us first find the sum of the geometric series: G_n = sum_{k=1}^n 2^k = 2 + 2^2 + ldots + 2^n.  This geometric series sum can be calculated using the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series: G_n = 2 frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2(2^n - 1).  Next, let's calculate the sum as though each 2^k term were multiplied by k, which is an arithmetic progression component: S'_n = sum_{k=1}^n k2^k.  This sum can be obtained by considering the derivative of G_n with respect to the common ratio r (substituting 2 in place of r after differentiation): S'_n = frac{d}{dr}left(2 frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1}right) bigg|_{r=2}.  Carrying out the derivative, we have: frac{d}{dr}left(2 frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1}right) = 2frac{(ncdot r^{n-1})(r - 1) - (r^n - 1)}{(r - 1)^2}, which evaluated at r = 2 gives: S'_n = 2 frac{(ncdot 2^{n-1})(2 - 1) - (2^n - 1)}{(2 - 1)^2} = 2(ncdot 2^n - 2^n + 1).  Now finally, we can subtract G_n from S'_n to correct for the fact that we added 1 to each term in the sequence {c_k}: T_n = S'_n - G_n = 2(ncdot 2^n - 2^n + 1) - 2(2^n - 1) = 2ncdot 2^n - 4cdot 2^n + 2 + 2 - 2 = 2ncdot 2^n - 4cdot 2^n + 2.  To simplify, we can factor out 2^n: T_n = 2^n(2n - 4) + 2 = 2^n(2n - 2) - 2(2^n - 1).  So finally: boxed{T_n = 2^n(2n - 2) - 2(2^n - 1)}."},{"instruction":"Find the equation of the tangent line to the curve y=(x+1)e^{x} at the point (0,1).","output":"Given the curve y=(x+1)e^{x}, First, find the derivative of the function: y'=(x+1)'e^{x}+(x+1)(e^{x})' = e^{x}+(x+1)e^{x} = (x+2)e^{x}.

A: ab > ac B: c(ba) < 0 C: cb^2 < ab^2 D: ac(ac) > 0","output":"Let's analyze the conditions given and each option: 1. Since we know ac < 0, it means that a and c have opposite signs. Because c < b < a and a must be positive for the product ac to be negative, it follows that c is negative. 2. Given that a is positive, a > b means that ab > ac, because multiplying by b (which is a positive or negative number but greater than c) will yield a result larger than ac (since c is negative). This validates option A: ab > ac. 3. Option B suggests that c(b - a) < 0. Since c is negative and (b - a) is also negative (because a > b), the product c(b - a) is positive. Therefore, option B is not necessarily true. 4. For option C, cb^2 < ab^2, since b^2 will always be positive and c < a, multiplying b^2 by c will produce a smaller number than multiplying b^2 by a. Hence, option C is necessarily true: cb^2 < ab^2. 5. Regarding option D: ac(a - c) > 0, here ac < 0, and since a - c is positive (because a > c), the product ac(a - c) is negative. Option D is not necessarily true. Revised solution statement: Given c < b < a, we have a is positive and c is negative. Multiplying both sides of the inequality b < a by b yields b^2 < ab, and since c is negative, cb^2 < ab^2 is satisfied. Multiplying ac < 0 by b maintains the inequality, so acb < 0b, resulting in ab > ac because c is negative and b is greater than c.  The complete step-by-step solution is: - Since ac < 0, we know that a and c have different signs. - Because c < b < a, we deduce that a is positive and c is negative. - The inequality ab > ac is valid because multiplying a positive number a by b gives a larger result than multiplying the negative number c by b. - The inequality cb^2 < ab^2 is valid because b^2 is positive and a is larger than c.

For the random selection of 45 volunteers using the random number method, and considering the process is repeated, we calculate the probability of including student A in both selections: - In the first round, the probability of including A is the ratio of the number of ways to choose 44 other students from the remaining 59 to the total number of ways to choose 45 students from 60, squared because we repeat the process.

This symmetry is due to the reflective properties of hyperbolas. Given this, we can express the difference in distances as follows: [ |P_{2}F_{1}|-|P_{1}F_{1}| = |P_{2}F_{1}|-|P_{2}F_{2}| ] Since the foci of the hyperbola are equidistant from the center, and given the geometry of the situation, the difference in distances is twice the distance between the center and one focus, which is 2 times 2 = 4. Therefore, statement A is true. **Statement B: P_{2}F_{1}bot P_{2}F_{2}** For this statement, we use the properties of an isosceles trapezoid formed by F_{1}, F_{2}, P_{2}, and P_{1}. The distance between the foci |F_{1}F_{2}|=8. Let |P_{1}F_{1}|=|P_{2}F_{2}|=t. Applying the cosine rule in triangle F_{1}F_{2}P_{1}, we get: [ (t+4)^2 = 64 + t^2 - 8t ] Solving this equation yields t=3. However, the condition for perpendicularity between P_{2}F_{1} and P_{2}F_{2} would require the Pythagorean theorem to hold, which it does not in this case. Thus, statement B is incorrect. **Statement C: The area of quadrilateral F_{1}F_{2}P_{2}P_{1} is frac{39sqrt{3}}}{4}** The height of the trapezoid is given by the distance from P_{1} to the x-axis, which is 3frac{sqrt{3}}{2}. The bases of the trapezoid are the distances between the points on the x-axis, which are 5 and 8. Therefore, the area of the trapezoid is calculated as: [ text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times (5+8) times frac{3sqrt{3}}{2} = frac{39sqrt{3}}{4} ] Hence, statement C is correct. **Statement D: The product of the slopes of lines MP_{3} and MP_{2} is 3** Given M(x_{0}, y_{0}), and the coordinates of P_{1}, P_{2}, and P_{3}, we can calculate the slopes of lines MP_{3} and MP_{2}. The product of these slopes is: [ k_{M{P_3}} cdot k_{M{P_2}} = frac{y_{0}+frac{3sqrt{3}}{2}}{x_{0}+frac{5}{2}} cdot frac{y_{0}-frac{3sqrt{3}}{2}}{x_{0}-frac{5}{2}} = frac{y_{0}^2-frac{27}{4}}{x_{0}^2-frac{25}{4}} ] Using the equation of the hyperbola to express y_{0}^2 in terms of x_{0}^2, we find that the product simplifies to 3.

As the graph of f(x) = frac{1}{x+1} + x + a - 1 is symmetric about the point (-1, -1), we apply this condition to find the value of a. Setting up the symmetry condition, we get a - 2 = -1, which yields a = 1. Thus, the function simplifies to f(x) = frac{1}{x+1} + x. Next, we calculate the derivative of f(x): f'(x) = frac{d}{dx} left( frac{1}{x+1} + x right) =1 - frac{1}{(x+1)^2}. The slope of the tangent at x=1 is then f'(1) = 1 - frac{1}{(1+1)^2} =frac{3}{4}. For the function g(x) = e^x + ax^2 + bx, when a=1, we find its derivative: g'(x) = frac{d}{dx} (e^x + x^2 + bx) = e^x + 2x+ b. At x=0, the slope of the tangent is g'(0) = e^0 + 2 cdot 0 + b = 1 + b. Since the tangents are perpendicular, their slopes have a product of -1: (1 + b) cdot frac{3}{4} = -1. Solving for b, we get b = -frac{7}{3}.

Therefore, the possible combinations of pies are:    - Fried with apple filling  (F_A)     - Fried with cherry filling  (F_C)     - Baked with apple filling  (B_A)     - Baked with cherry filling  (B_C)     Hence, there are four possible types of pies:    [    {F_A, F_C, B_A, B_C}    ] 2. **Consider the cases:**    We will analyze the cases based on the number of types of pies available for sale. **Case 1: At least three types of pies are available:** - Without loss of generality, suppose we have three types of pies, say ( F_A ), ( F_C ), and ( B_A ).   - Notice that none of these three pies can be the same type in both criteria (filling and preparation method), they're distinct at least in one criteria.   - However, we need pies different in both properties. For example:     - ( F_A ) vs ( B_C )      - Fried apple pie differs in both the filling and the preparation method from a Baked cherry pie. Thus, selecting ( F_A ) and ( B_C ) we see they differ in both filling and preparation method. This implies that if we have at least three different types of pies: [ boxed{text{We can always find two pies that differ in both filling and preparation method.}} ] **Case 2: Only two types of pies are available:** - If there are only two types of pies available, they must differ in either filling or preparation, not both.

Since both pies in each pair must differ either in preparation or filling, it is impossible to have two pies differing in both properties: thus this case does not require consideration since we need only pairs differing in both filling and preparation. **Conclusion:** - The only cases we need to prove our claim is the first case shown above.

Factorize the right-hand side common term, ( sqrt{n} ):    [    k^3 + 3kn - m = (3k^2 + n)sqrt{n}    ] 6.

Given that ( k ), ( m ), and ( n ) are all integers, ( frac{k^3 + 3kn - m}{3k^2 + n} ) must also be an integer. As ( sqrt{n} ) is rational and non-negative, it must be an integer.

Then NA = ND = NB, so D lies on the circle with diameter AB.    - Since angle ADB = 90^circ, we have angle ADB + angle BDZ = 180^circ, implying that A, D, Z are collinear.

By La Hire's theorem, the polar of K with respect to the circle with diameter AC goes through Z.    - Therefore, ZB is the polar of K with respect to the circle with diameter AC, making K the inverse of B with respect to this circle. 7. **Use harmonic division:**    - It is well known that (K, B; A, C) = -1. Let K' be the reflection of B with respect to J.    - Since JB^2 = JA cdot JC, inversion with respect to (K'B) takes A to C, implying (K', B; A, C) = -1, so K = K'.    - Thus, J is the midpoint of KB. 8. **Prove the lemma:**    - Let A, B, C, D be four points on a circle omega. Tangents to omega at A and D meet at M, and tangents to omega at B and C meet at N.    - Let J = AB cap CD. By Brocard's theorem, JF is the polar of E, and by La Hire's theorem, the polar of E goes through M and N, making J, M, F, N collinear. 9. **Conclude the proof:**    - Let DG meet (AB) and (BC) again at E and F respectively. Let ZB cap O_1O_2 = O.    - Since O_1A, O_1D, OB are tangent to (AB), by our lemma, OE is tangent to (AB). Similarly, OF is tangent to (BC), implying OB = OE = OF, making O the circumcenter of triangle EBF.    - Let M be the midpoint of AC. Since {R, B, P} in (ZM), we have angle EAB = angle EDB = angle BZC.    - Since BZ perp AC, AE perp ZC. Similarly, CF perp ZA, so CF and AZ meet at (AC).    - AE, CF, ZB concur at the orthocenter H of triangle ZAC. The inversion with center Z and radius ZR takes H to B.    - Since ZRBMP is cyclic, H in RP. Let I in RP such that BI perp RP. By Simson's theorem, I in X'Y'.    - Since angle X'IB = angle X'RB = angle ZMB = angle IBK, X'IY' goes through the midpoint J of KB.    - Since {E, I, F} in (HB), OI = OB. Since JI = JB, the line JX'IY' is the reflection of AC with respect to the line O_1O_3.    - Therefore, X'Y' is the other common external tangent of omega_1 and omega_3. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Sophia rents a car for 30 a day and 0.25 per mile.

Therefore, we can calculate B's speed as follows: Speed of B = Distance / Time Speed of B = 160 meters / 32 seconds Speed of B = 5 meters/second Now, we can use B's speed to find out how long it takes B to run 140 meters: Time for B to run 140 meters = Distance / Speed Time for B to run 140 meters = 140 meters / 5 meters/second Time for B to run 140 meters = 28 seconds Since A and B are running at the same time and A beats B by 20 meters, it means that A runs 160 meters in the same time B runs 140 meters.

This symmetry leads us to conclude that sin varphi =1 or sin varphi =-1. Step 2: Determine the possible values of varphi based on the symmetry.

This means we are looking for a number that can be expressed as the difference between the squares of two even numbers that follow each other. Given the options: A: 2020 B: 2021 C: 2022 D: 2023 We first note that the square of an even number is always even, and the difference between the squares of two consecutive even numbers is also even. This immediately tells us that 2021 and 2023, being odd numbers, cannot be \\"sum fusion numbers\\". Let's denote the two consecutive even numbers as 2k+2 and 2k, where k is an integer.

So, the annual cost for medication is 1530 (total annual cost) - 800 (doctor's visits) = 730. Now, let's calculate the cost of the medication before insurance coverage: Since insurance covers 80% of the medication cost, Tom pays the remaining 20%. If 730 is 20% of the total medication cost, we can find the total cost before insurance (100%) by dividing 730 by 20% (or 0.2): Total medication cost before insurance = 730 / 0.2 = 3650. Now, let's find out the cost per pill before insurance coverage: Tom takes 2 pills every day, so he takes 2 * 365 = 730 pills per year. The cost per pill before insurance coverage is the total medication cost before insurance divided by the number of pills: Cost per pill before insurance = 3650 / 730 pills = 5 per pill. Therefore, each pill costs boxed{5}  before insurance coverage."},{"instruction":"A semiprofessional basketball league has teams with 25 players each.

From the standard equation of an ellipse, we know that a^2 = b^2 + c^2. Substituting the known values gives: [a^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2] Thus, a = sqrt{2}. Therefore, the equation of the ellipse C is: [frac{x^2}{2} + y^2 = 1] Encapsulating the final answer: [boxed{frac{x^2}{2} + y^2 = 1}]  (Ⅱ) Proving the Product of the Slopes is Constant Let the equation of line l be y=k(x-1), where k neq 0.

Again by the pigeonhole principle, at least one of these subintervals must contain infinitely many terms of { a_n }. 7. Repeat the process of subdividing and choosing the interval containing infinitely many terms:     - Divide the current subinterval into 10 smaller subintervals.     - Choose the subinterval that contains infinitely many terms of the sequence { a_n }.    8. This process will generate a sequence of nested intervals I_1 supseteq I_2 supseteq I_3 supseteq ldots, each of which contains infinitely many terms of { a_n }. 9. The length of these intervals is reduced by a factor of 10 at each step, so the length of the interval I_n is frac{1}{10^n}. 10. According to the Nested Interval Theorem, the intersection of this sequence of intervals contains exactly one point. Let's denote this point by c. 11.

The equation can be interpreted as a two-digit number (6A) plus a two-digit number (B2) equals 77. Let's break down the two-digit numbers: - The first two-digit number has a tens digit of 6 and a ones digit of A, so the number is 60 + A. - The second two-digit number has a tens digit of B and a ones digit of 2, so the number is 10B + 2.

Therefore, the sequence of points A_{4}, A_{5}, A_{6}, ldots represents midpoints of previous segments. 3. We start constructing triangles and examining their angles. Since A_{4} is the midpoint of A_{1}A_{2}, A_{5} is the midpoint of A_{2}A_{3}, and A_{6} is the midpoint of A_{3}A_{1}, we first find that A_{4}, A_{5}, A_{6} form triangle A_{4}A_{5}A_{6}, which has vertices at the midpoints of triangle A_{1}A_{2}A_{3}. 4.

Following the reference solution, let's break down the steps in detail: 1. **Prime Factorization Insight**:    - Every positive integer can be expressed as the product of a power of 2 and an odd number, i.e., for any integer ( n ), we can write ( n = 2^k cdot m ), where ( k ) is a non-negative integer, and ( m ) is an odd number. 2. **Generating Odd Numbers Set**:    - Consider the set of integers from 1 to 100. We can extract the odd part of each number by continuously dividing the number by 2 until it becomes odd. Let's denote this odd part by ( m ).    - Consequently, we will have the integers grouped based on their odd parts. Formally, if ( n = 2^k cdot m ), where ( m ) is odd, then similar numbers will share the same ( m ). 3. **Applying the Pigeonhole Principle**:    - There are 51 numbers and we need to categorize them by the odd part ( m ).    - The odd numbers in the range from 1 to 100 can be listed and verified. There are exactly 50 odd numbers between 1 and 100.    - Because there are only 50 possible odd parts ( m ), and we have 51 different numbers, the pigeonhole principle states that at least two of these numbers will share the same odd part ( m ). 4. **Implication of Shared Odd Part**:    - Suppose the two numbers ( n_1 ) and ( n_2 ) share the same odd part ( m ). Then, we can write:      [      n_1 = 2^{k_1} cdot m quad text{and} quad n_2 = 2^{k_2} cdot m      ]    - Without loss of generality, assume ( k_1 leq k_2 ). Then,      [      frac{n_2}{n_1} = frac{2^{k_2} cdot m}{2^{k_1} cdot m} = 2^{k_2 - k_1}      ]    - Since ( k_2 geq k_1 ), ( 2^{k_2 - k_1} ) is an integer.    - Therefore, ( n_2 ) is a multiple of ( n_1 ). 5. **Conclusion**:    - We have shown that at least one of the numbers in the set of 51 numbers is a multiple of another, satisfying the problem's requirement.

We must thus declare \\"NEI\\" for g(g(3)). For g(g^{-1}(3)), by definition of the inverse, g(g^{-1}(3)) = 3. g^{-1}(6), as determined already, is 3. Thus, g^{-1}(g^{-1}(6)) = g^{-1}(3). Using the table, we know g(1) = 3, hence g^{-1}(3) = 1. Summing the feasible calculations:  g(g^{-1}(3)) + g^{-1}(g^{-1}(6)) = 3 + 1 = 4.

In some of these cells, one of the diagonals is drawn so that no two diagonals share a common point (including endpoints). 2. To determine the maximum possible number of diagonals that can be drawn under these conditions, we start by providing an example with 16 diagonals, as demonstrated in the provided image. 3. Let's attempt to prove that it is impossible to draw 17 diagonals without any two of them having a common point.  First Method: 4. Each diagonal has two endpoints, and these endpoints must be located at the vertices (nodes) of the grid. The total number of nodes in the grid is ( (5+1) times (5+1) = 36 ). 5. There are twelve nodes located on the boundary of the inner 3x3 square. Hence, we can draw at most 12 diagonals that have their endpoints on these boundary nodes. 6. If there were 17 diagonals, then the remaining 5 diagonals would need to be drawn in the central and four corner cells of the grid. 7. Thus, four nodes located at the vertices of the grid do not serve as endpoints for any diagonal. Hence, the diagonals would have at most ( 36 -4 = 32 ) endpoints, which must be distinct. 8. This is contradictory because 17 diagonals should have exactly ( 2 times 17 = 34 ) endpoints. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_e8dfada95fe97b3690e8g-10.jpg?height=326&width=922&top_left_y=2378&top_left_x=566)  Second Method: 9. Consider any rectangular subgrid of size ( 5 times 2 ). It can contain no more than 6 diagonals, each contributing one endpoint to one of the six central nodes in the 5-cell subgrid. 10. Across all rows except the central one in the 5-row grid, a maximum of 12 diagonals can be drawn because each row (excluding the central row) has at most 6 diagonals. 11. Thus, there must be at least ( 17 - 12 = 5 ) diagonals in the central row, indicating that each cell in this central row contains a diagonal. 12. Similarly, we can prove that all cells in the central column must also contain diagonals, given the symmetrical arrangement of the grid. 13. However, this implies that the diagonals in neighboring cells share common points, violating the condition that no two diagonals can share points, including endpoints. 14. This contradiction implies that it is impossible to draw 17 diagonals without any two diagonals having a common point.

Since we've noted that the multiplication button is broken, only addition can be performed. 2. **Key Observations**:     - No matter how many addition operations are performed, the final result's parity (even or odd) is determined by the last number added.     - We denote the event of obtaining an odd result as ( A ). The parity of the final result depends only on the parity of the last number added due to the commutative property of addition under modulo 2. 3. **Probability Calculation**:     - Suppose the Scientist enters a series of numbers and operations. With equal probability, the last number added can be either even or odd.     - Let ( p ) be the probability that the previous number (before the last one) was odd, meaning the current state is also influenced by this last digit. 4. **Combining Probabilities**:     - If the previous number is odd (with probability ( p )), the result remains odd if the last number is even. Thus, the probability of ( A ) is:       [       frac{p}{2}       ]     - If the previous number is even (with probability ( 1 - p )), the result becomes odd if the last number is odd.

To do this, let's analyze the sign of each term for negative values of (x). 3. Consider each negative value of (x):    - For (x < 0), (x^4) and (x^2) are positive because even powers of any negative number are positive.    - (x^3) and (x) are negative because odd powers of any negative number are negative.     4.

Therefore, the midlines (EG) and (FH) intersect at point (O), the centroid of the quadrilateral. 3. **Observing the formation of smaller quadrilaterals:**    By connecting (E), (F), (G), (H), and (O), we form four smaller quadrilaterals: (EOHF), (FOHG), (GOHE), and (HOEF). The problem asks us to show that the sum of the areas of two non-adjacent quadrilaterals equals the sum of the areas of the other two. 4. **Splitting into triangles:**    To make the calculation simpler, note that these quadrilaterals can be split into triangles.

Therefore, the area of ( triangle AOE ), ( triangle COF ), ( triangle COG ), and ( triangle AOH ) adds up to half of the area of the original quadrilateral (ABCD). 6. **Equal area quadrilaterals:**    From the drawing and area properties of the triangles formed by the midlines, it becomes clear that:    [    text{Area of quadrilateral } A = triangle AOE + triangle AOH + triangle HOE    ]    [    text{Area of quadrilateral } B = triangle BOF + triangle BOH + triangle FOH    ]    [    text{Area of quadrilateral } C = triangle COF + triangle COG + triangle FOG    ]    [    text{Area of quadrilateral } D = triangle DOF + triangle DOG + triangle FOD    ] 7. **Summing the areas:**    Adding areas:    - Quadrilaterals (A + C): involves triangles (AOE, AOH, HOE, COF, COG, FOG).    - Quadrilaterals (B + D): involves triangles (BOF, BOH, FOH, DOF, DOG, FOD).    Since the triangles formed by the midlines intersecting at the centroid split the area into equal halves, it indicates that the sum of non-adjacent quadrilaterals (A) and (C) is equal to the sum of non-adjacent quadrilaterals (B) and (D). 8. **Conclusion:**    The key result here is the symmetrical property of the midlines division of the quadrilateral:    [    text{Area}(A + C) = text{Area}(B + D)    ]    Hence, we have proved that the sum of the areas of one pair of non-adjacent quadrilaterals equals the sum of the areas of the other pair.

This is done because doubling does not affect our ability to later reduce by subtracting to zero. 6. **Zeroing Elements in the First Row**:     - Subtract ( m ) from each element in the first row (since ( m ) is the smallest, this will ensure at least one zero in each step). Formally, we perform ( m ) row subtractions on the first row.     - Now, the first row will have at least one zero due to the minimal value subtraction. 7. **Iteration and Reduction**:     - Repeat the process with the updated values in the first row until every element in the first row is zero.     - Notice the sum of the first row reduces with each step. 8. **Process Extension to Subsequent Rows**:     - Once the first row consists entirely of zeros, move to the second row.     - Apply the same steps: double columns if required and subtract the row's minimum value iteratively until the row becomes all zero.     - Continue this process for all rows. 9. **Invariance of Zeros in Higher Rows**:     - Doubling operations do not alter zeros in previous rows since multiplying zero by any number remains zero.     - Therefore, successive actions will not affect rows that are already made of zeros. 10. **Completion**:     - By continuing this process, row by row, we ensure that every element of the table eventually becomes zero. # Conclusion: After applying the described strategy to all rows sequentially, we are guaranteed to transform the entire table into a matrix of zeros using the allowed operations.

Now we need to subtract the number of placements where the two cars are adjacent, either to the left or right of each other. Consider the number of valid positions where the black car is placed first:    - If a black car is parked at position 1, the pink car can be parked to the right at position 2.    - If a black car is parked at position 2, the pink car can be either at position 1 or position 3.    - Generally, if a black car is parked at position ( k ), the pink car can be parked at ( k-1 ) or ( k+1 ). 3. Calculate the total number of adjacent cases:    - For each position ( k ) from 1 to 49 (because parking at position 50 does not allow for the pink car to be to the right), there are 2 ways to place the pink car, except at positions 1 and 50 which only provide 1 adjacent position.    - Therefore, there are ( 49 times 2 ) ways to have them parked adjacently. 4.

This implies that the vertex of the parabola defined by g(x) must be on the x-axis, which means the minimum value of g(x) is 0. The vertex form of a quadratic function is given by y = a(x-h)^2 + k, where (h, k) is the vertex of the parabola. For g(x) to have its vertex on the x-axis, k = 0. To find the conditions for a, we use the discriminant Delta of the quadratic equation, which must be equal to 0 for the parabola to touch the x-axis. The discriminant Delta is given by Delta = b^2 - 4ac, where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x^2, x, and the constant term, respectively, in the quadratic equation.

Since f(x) = frac{1}{2}x + frac{5}{2} is a linear function and is increasing over its entire domain, we can directly compute its minimum and maximum values over the interval [-1, 1] as follows: - Minimum value of f(x) at x = -1: f(-1) = frac{1}{2}(-1) + frac{5}{2} = 2 - Maximum value of f(x) at x = 1: f(1) = frac{1}{2}(1) + frac{5}{2} = 3 Next, we analyze the behavior of g(x) = x^2 - 2ax + 4a - 3 over the interval [-1, 1] based on the value of a: - **When a leq -1 or a geq 1:** The function g(x) is either increasing or decreasing over the entire interval [-1, 1].

What is the value of b?","output":"Given that the expression is 70% of y, we can write this as: (70/100) * y = (8y) / b + (3y) / 10 Now, let's simplify the left side of the equation: (7/10) * y = (8y) / b + (3y) / 10 To solve for b, we need to get rid of the denominators. We can do this by finding a common denominator for the terms on the right side of the equation. The common denominator for b and 10 is 10b. We multiply each term by 10b to eliminate the denominators: 10b * (7/10) * y = 10b * (8y) / b + 10b * (3y) / 10 Simplifying each term, we get: 7by = 80y + 3by Now, we want to isolate b, so we'll move all terms containing b to one side and the term without b to the other side: 7by - 3by = 80y Combine like terms: 4by = 80y Now, we can solve for b by dividing both sides by 4y: b = (80y) / (4y) Simplify by canceling out the y terms: b = 80 / 4 b = 20 So, the value of b is boxed{20} ."},{"instruction":"Fresh grapes contain a certain percentage of water by weight, while dried grapes contain 20% water by weight. The weight of dry grapes available from 20 kg of fresh grapes is 2.5 kg. What is the percentage of water in fresh grapes by weight?","output":"Let's denote the percentage of water in fresh grapes as P%. This means that the fresh grapes contain P% water and (100 - P)% of solid content by weight. When grapes are dried, the water content is reduced to 20%, and the solid content remains the same because only water is removed during the drying process. The weight of the solid content in the fresh grapes can be calculated by taking the total weight of the fresh grapes and subtracting the weight of the water in them. Since the solid content remains the same in both fresh and dried grapes, we can set up the following equation: Solid content in fresh grapes = Solid content in dried grapes (100 - P)% of 20 kg = 80% of 2.5 kg Now we can solve for P: (100 - P)/100 * 20 kg = 80/100 * 2.5 kg (100 - P) * 20 = 80 * 2.5 2000 - 20P = 200 2000 - 200 = 20P 1800 = 20P P = 1800 / 20 P = 90 Therefore, the percentage of water in fresh grapes by weight is boxed{90%} ."},{"instruction":"Given functions f(x)=x+m and g(x)=x^2mx+frac{m^2}{2}+2m3.

Since x=1 is a root of the equation x^2 - mx + 2m - 4 = 0, we substitute x=1: [ 1 - m + 2m - 4 = 0 ] Solving for m, we find m = 3. To ensure the inequality has real solutions, the discriminant Delta = m^2 - 4(2m - 4) must be greater than 0, which simplifies to: [ (m - 4)^2 > 0 ] This implies m neq 4. Since we found m = 3 satisfies the equation, we substitute m = 3 into the original inequality: [ x^2 - 3x + 2 < 0 ] Solving this inequality, we find the solution set is 1 < x < 2, hence a = 2.
