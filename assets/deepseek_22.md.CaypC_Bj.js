Argentina declares mourning for flood victims Parents demands common forms for nursery admissions On a scale from 0 to 5, where 0 is \\"no meaning overlap\\" and 5 is \\"means the same thing\\", how closely does the first sentence resemble the second one?","output":"In terms of meaning overlap, the first sentence – \\"Argentina declares mourning for flood victims\\" – and the second sentence – \\"Parents demand common forms for nursery admissions\\" – have very little in common, and I would rate the similarity between these two sentences at a 0.5 out of 5. To better understand why these two sentences do not closely resemble each other, let's analyze both of them separately. The first sentence, \\"Argentina declares mourning for flood victims,\\" discusses a specific country (Argentina) and its response to a natural disaster (flooding) that has led to a number of casualties. The mourning declaration is likely a formal recognition and expression of grief for those who have lost their lives or been affected by this devastating event. On the other hand, the second sentence, \\"Parents demand common forms for nursery admissions,\\" pertains to the requests of parents for a standardized process in nursery or pre-school admissions. This topic is more about education and the administrative aspects of enrolling children in early learning institutions. It does not have any direct connection to natural disasters, a specific country's response to such incidents, or expressions of grief and mourning. Hence, both sentences address very different subjects with distinct themes – one being a response to a natural disaster, while the other is related to the education system and admission procedures. The low 0.5 score on the 0-5 scale is given solely due to the fact that both sentences involve a form of organized response to a particular issue by a concerned party (Argentina's government or parents, respectively)."},{"instruction":"What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  Ocean water pulls sand off of beaches - Ocean water breaks rocks off of cliffs - Ocean water carries sand and rocks into the ocean - Sand and rocks go to other land or the bottom of the ocean.","output":"The missing first step is: Wave action and currents erode the coastline."},{"instruction":"Generate a question that has the following answer:  bloody axe  for the following movie plot:  In summer of 1958, Barry and Claudette, two Camp Crystal Lake counselors, sneak into a storage barn to copulate.

A group of gypsies sneak illegally into Paris, but are ambushed by Judge Claude Frollo, the minister of justice. A gypsy woman in the group attempts to flee with her deformed baby, but Frollo chases and kills her outside Notre Dame. He tries to kill the baby as well, but the cathedral's archdeacon intervenes and accuses Frollo of murdering an innocent woman. To atone for his sin, Frollo reluctantly agrees to raise the deformed child in Notre Dame as his son, naming him Quasimodo. Twenty years later, Quasimodo develops into a kind yet isolated young man who has lived inside the cathedral his entire life. A trio of living stone gargoylesâVictor, Hugo, and Laverneâserve as Quasimodo's only company, and encourage him to attend the annually-held Festival of Fools.

Here is a news article: The Navy has banned vaping throughout its fleet after multiple explosions caused by overheating batteries, it announced Friday.      “The fleet commanders implemented this policy to protect the safety and welfare of sailors and to protect the ships, submarines, aircraft and equipment,” a press release said.      ADVERTISEMENT      “Multiple sailors have suffered serious injuries from these devices, to include first- and second-degree burns and facial disfigurement.”      The ban covers the use, possession, storage and charging of e-cigarettes aboard ships, submarines, aircraft, boats, craft and heavy equipment.      It applies to sailors, Marines, Military Sealift Command civilians and any personnel working on or visiting those units.      The ban goes into effect May 14 and will last “until a final determination can be made following a thorough analysis,” the release said.      Deployed units can ask for an extension to keep their e-cigarettes until their next port visit, but supervisors have to make sure the batteries are removed and stored in plastic non-conductive container.      Sailors in bases on shore will still be allowed to vape in designated smoking areas, the release noted.      Between October 2015 and June 2016, there were 15 incidents involving e-cigarettes that injured sailors, started fires or damaged material, according to the Naval Safety Center.      In two of the incidents, the device was in the sailor’s mouth at the time, causing facial and dental injuries. ||||| Navy Tells Sailors To Leave The E-Cigarette On Shore      Enlarge this image toggle caption Marko Drobnjakovic/AP Marko Drobnjakovic/AP      After a series of \\"mishaps,\\" the Navy says it will no longer allow sailors to bring electronic cigarettes onto its ships, submarines, aircraft, boats, craft and heavy equipment.      \\"The prohibition applies to Sailors, Marines, Military Sealift Command civilians and any personnel working on or visiting those units,\\" according to a statement obtained by NPR's Sarah McCammon, issued by the commanders of the U.S. Fleet Forces and the U.S. Pacific Fleet.      \\"The Fleet commanders implemented this policy to protect the safety and welfare of Sailors and to protect the ships, submarines, aircraft and equipment,\\" it adds.      The ban will go into force on May 14 and will \\"remain in effect until a final determination can be made following a thorough analysis,\\" the Navy says. At the same time, \\"sailors on shore will still be allowed to use [Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems] on base, but must do so in designated smoking areas ashore while on military installations.\\"      The problem is e-cigarette lithium-ion batteries that can explode. Last year, Navy Times reported that the Naval Safety Center called for a full ban of the devices on Navy property, citing their \\"significant and unacceptable risk.\\"      In August, Navy spokeswoman Lt. Marycate Walsh told the publication that \\"leadership is reviewing the Naval Safety Center's recommendation regarding e-cigarettes, weighing both the safety and health-related risks.\\"      A Navy memorandum states that 15 \\"mishaps\\" occurred between October 2015 and June 15, 2016, that resulted in either injury to Navy personnel or \\"fire/materiel damage.\\"      \\"Eight of these incidents occurred onboard Naval vessels/aircraft,\\" the memo reads. \\"Nine of 15 reported incidents described the failure mechanism as explosive. ... Two battery explosions occurred with the electronic cigarette in the service member's mouth resulting in facial and dental injuries.\\"      The memo says the Navy has no record of any such incidents prior to October 2015.      The Navy says there is increased use of e-cigarettes among Navy personnel — and the apparent dangers have been highlighted in Navy publications.      A four-page spread in the Navy magazine Sea Compass titled \\"Danger: The Hidden Risks of Vaping\\" tells the story of two sailors who were the victims of an exploding battery. One received first-degree burns, while the other's car was destroyed by the fire.      \\"Imagine what would have happened if the batteries had exploded while in their home, the barracks or even onboard their ship,\\" the article says. \\"The loss of property and potential loss of life could have been catastrophic.\\"      As the Navy has noted, the dangers of exploding batteries can be mitigated by properly stowing the devices, using the correct charger, buying equipment from a reputable manufacturer and not modifying it.      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration finalized its first regulations for e-cigarettes last year.      The U.S. Department of Transportation formally banned e-cigarette use on commercial flights last year. The ban is meant to protect other passengers from the vapor, due to a lack of information about the ingredients in e-cigarettes.      A Navy spokesman says regulations allow personnel to smoke tobacco cigarettes on a ship's \\"smoke deck\\" at designated times. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The US Navy has banned the use of e-cigarettes throughout its fleet due to multiple explosions caused by overheating batteries.

Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27€ compared to 12€ for adults and 10€ for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5€.

Much of Broadmoor's architecture is still Victorian, including the Grade 1 listed gatehouse, which has a clock tower.  Following long-standing reports that the old buildings were unfit for purpose (for therapy or safety), planning permission was granted in 2012 for a PS242 million redevelopment, involving a new unit comprising 10 wards to adjoin the existing 6 wards of the modern Paddock Unit, resulting in total bed numbers of 234. Building company Kier reported in 2013 a sum of PS115m for the new unit of 162 beds, ready to accept patients by the start of 2017, and PS43m for a separate new medium secure unit for men nearby.[1][2][3][4][5]  A new unit called the Paddock Centre already opened on 12 December 2005 to contain and treat patients classed as having a 'dangerous severe personality disorder' (DSPD). This was a new and much debated category invented on behalf of the UK government, based on an individual being considered a 'Grave and Immediate Danger' to the general public, and meeting some combination of criteria for personality disorders and/or high scores on the Hare Psychopathy Check list - Revised. The Paddock Centre was designed to eventually house 72 patients, but never opened more than four of its six 12-bedded wards. The Dept of Health and Ministry of Justice National Personality Disorder Strategy published in October 2011 concluded that the resources invested in the DSPD programme should instead be used in prison based treatment programmes and the DSPD service at Broadmoor was required to close by 31 March 2012. The patients were transferred either back to prison, on to medium secure units to continue treatment, on to the residual national DSPD service at the Peaks Unit in Rampton, or to elsewhere in Broadmoor in the Personality Disorder directorate.

Imagine we want to make a pretty ball for your garden, like a decoration, and we'll use an old bowling ball for that. Here's how we'll make it into a beautiful Garden Sphere: 1. Clean the bowling ball: First, we'll wipe the bowling ball using a damp cloth to clean any dirt, dust, or oils. We want a clean ball so the paint can stick better. 2. Choose paint type: We'll need a special paint to color our ball. We pick outdoor acrylic paint because it's strong and can survive rain and sun in the garden. 3. Pick fun colors: You can choose your favorite colors or even pick a theme like the rainbow, flowers, or stars. We'll need a few colors to make it more fun! 4. Prepare the ball: We will place the ball on a stand or a bucket so it doesn't roll away and we can paint on it easily. 5. Start painting: Using paint brushes, we'll gently paint the ball with our chosen colors. We can make patterns like dots, stripes, or even paint little pictures of your favorite animals. 6. Let it dry: After painting, we'll wait for some hours to let our ball dry. The paint needs time to become strong and stick on the ball. 7. Seal the paint: To protect our pretty ball from rain and sunshine, we'll use a clear outdoor sealer. We'll paint it all over the ball and let it dry again. 8. Time to decorate: Once the sealer is dry, our beautiful Garden Sphere is ready! We can place it in your garden, and it'll make a fun, colorful decoration. Remember, you can ask for help from a grown-up to make your Garden Sphere and be careful when using paint and the sealer.

If Jim lowers carbon dioxide to the ocean, the level of acidity in the ocean becomes greater or smaller? Answer:","output":"If Jim lowers the level of carbon dioxide in the ocean, the level of acidity in the ocean becomes smaller. The passage states that higher levels of dissolved carbon dioxide in ocean water cause the water to become more acidic. Thus, if Jim lowers the amount of carbon dioxide in the ocean, it will result in a decrease in the dissolved carbon dioxide levels. Consequently, the water will become less acidic, and the level of acidity will become smaller. This is due to the relationship between carbon dioxide and ocean acidity. When carbon dioxide dissolves in water, it forms carbonic acid, which contributes to the overall acidity of the water. By lowering the concentration of carbon dioxide in the ocean, Jim is effectively reducing the amount of carbonic acid formed, leading to a smaller level of acidity in the ocean."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Reginald Martinez Jackson (born May 18, 1946) is an American former professional baseball right fielder who played 21 seasons for the Kansas City / Oakland Athletics, Baltimore Orioles, New York Yankees, and California Angels of Major League Baseball (MLB). Jackson was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1993. Jackson was nicknamed \\"Mr. October\\" for his clutch hitting in the postseason with the Athletics and the Yankees. He helped Oakland win five consecutive American League West divisional pennants, three consecutive American League pennants and three consecutive World Series titles, from 1971 to 1975. Context: In 1980, Jackson batted .300 for the only time in his career, and his 41 home runs tied with Ben Oglivie of the Milwaukee Brewers for the American League lead. However, the Yankees were swept in the ALCS by the Kansas City Royals.  As he entered the last year of his Yankee contract in 1981, Jackson endured several difficulties from George Steinbrenner. After the owner consulted Jackson about signing then-free agent Dave Winfield, Jackson expected Steinbrenner to work out a new contract for him as well. Steinbrenner never did (some say never intending to) and Jackson played the season as a free agent. Jackson started slowly with the bat, and when the 1981 Major League Baseball strike began, Steinbrenner invoked a clause in Jackson's contract forcing him to take a complete physical examination. Jackson was outraged and blasted Steinbrenner in the media. When the season resumed, Jackson's hitting improved, partly to show Steinbrenner he wasn't finished as a player. He hit a long home run into the upper deck in Game Five of the strike-forced 1981 American League Division Series with the Brewers, and the Yankees went on to win the pennant again. However, Jackson injured himself running the bases in Game Two of the 1981 ALCS and missed the first two games of the World Series, both of which the Yankees won.  Jackson was medically cleared to play Game Three, but manager Bob Lemon refused to start him or even play him, allegedly acting under orders from Steinbrenner. The Yankees lost that game and Jackson played the remainder of the series, hitting a home run in Game Four. However, they lost the last three games and the World Series to the Dodgers.  Jackson had faced the Dodgers four straight times in the World Series by 1981. No other player in Major League history has played against the same team more consecutive times in the Fall Classic. Question: What were his trouble with Steinbrenner?. Whats the answer?","output":"Reginald Martinez Jackson had a fraught relationship with George Steinbrenner, the owner of the New York Yankees, particularly in 1981.  As Jackson was entering the last year of his contract with the Yankees in 1981, Steinbrenner involved him in conversations regarding signing Dave Winfield, who was a free agent at the time. Consequently, Jackson held an expectation that Steinbrenner would negotiate a new contract for him as well. However, this expectation was left unfulfilled. Steinbrenner never worked out a new contract for Jackson, leading some to believe that Steinbrenner never actually intended to. This contractual strand left Jackson to play the season as a free agent. Jackson's on-field performance also added strain to the relationship with Steinbrenner. During the early part of the season, he was performing poorly with the bat. Moreover, when the 1981 Major League Baseball strike began, Steinbrenner invoked a clause in Jackson's contract that required him to undertake a comprehensive physical examination. This move by Steinbrenner drew outrage from Jackson, who did not hold back in criticizing Steinbrenner in public through the media. When the season resumed, Jackson was determined to prove his worth as a player partly to contradict Steinbrenner's doubts. However, he sustained an injury while running bases during the American League Championship Series (ALCS), temporarily sidelining him. Even after obtaining medical clearance to play, Jackson faced another slight when he was neither started nor played in Game Three of the World Series, reportedly due to instructions from Steinbrenner. Throughout this period, despite his challenges and his contentious relationship with Steinbrenner, Jackson remained an important part of the Yankees' line-up. Most notably, he hit a significant home run in Game Four of the World Series, although this wasn't enough to lead the team to victory and they lost the series to the Dodgers. In summary, Jackson's friction with Steinbrenner stemmed from contractual issues and Steinbrenner seeming to doubt Jackson's physical fitness and worth as a player. The conflicting interests and tensions between these two figures could not be resolved effectively, leading to a difficult and challenging period in Jackson's career with the Yankees."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The oldest website on the Internet is the CERN website, which was created in 1990 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee. This makes it a unique distinction from being an abbreviation, a description, a human, a location, or a numeric value. To provide some context, Tim Berners-Lee is an English engineer and computer scientist who is best known for inventing the World Wide Web (WWW). The World Wide Web is an information space where documents and other digital resources are identified using URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). Resources shared using the Internet protocol suite play a significant role in the functioning of the World Wide Web. In 1989, while working at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), Berners-Lee proposed a project called \\"Information Management: A Proposal\\" that envisioned a network of interconnected documents accessible through the Internet. This proposal eventually led to the creation of the first-ever website, which was published on August 6, 1991. The website contained a vast amount of information about hypertext, the technical aspects of creating web pages, and guidelines on how to create one's own web server. The original website is no longer live as it was initially; however, CERN has recreated the original web page at a new address (http://info.cern.ch/) to preserve its historical significance.

Why is Spotify not available in India?","output":"While both questions essentially inquire about the same subject - the unavailability of Spotify in India - they are not structured identically, and thus are not the same in their phrasing. However, the differences in their wording are rather minor, and the answers to both questions would be the same. First, let's look at the first question: \\"Why Spotify is not available in India?\\" This question has the subject (\\"Spotify\\") before the auxiliary verb (\\"is\\"), which might be considered less grammatically correct or less standard in English. It could be perceived as being more informal or colloquial. A native English speaker may understand the question but could possibly find it slightly awkward, as a more natural phrasing would be to place the auxiliary verb before the subject. Now let's examine the second question: \\"Why is Spotify not available in India?\\" In this version, the auxiliary verb comes before the subject (\\"is\\" before \\"Spotify\\") which results in a grammatically correct and standard question in English. This forms a correct interrogative sentence structure and would be the more natural phrasing for native English speakers. To summarize, although the questions are not the same in their phrasing, they both ask about the same topic, which is the unavailability of Spotify in India. The second question features a more standard and grammatically correct structure for posing this question in English, making it the more preferred choice.

That's all that's needed to force a wide-ranging House debate — and votes — on border security and the immigration status of 700,000 undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children. Since moderate Republicans opposed House leadership two weeks ago with a rare discharge petition to force a so-called \\"queen of the hill\\" debate (House rule based on the most votes) on immigration, the measure has steadily accumulated support within their own party. The petition needs 218 signatures to start that debate and — with the assumption that all 193 House Democrats will sign on — Republicans need just two more signatures. But that effort now goes on hold as Congress leaves town for an 11-day holiday recess, giving all sides breathing room to figure out what comes next. Many of the 23 Republican signers of the petition face tough re-election races in their districts this November.

Jonathan Harker, a lawyer traveling from London to Transylvania to secure property for Count Dracula, arrives at Bistritz to stay for the night. There, he is warned by a concerned lady against continuing his journey the following day. Harker believes that her concerns are rooted in peasant superstition. He ignores her, but starts to feel increasingly unnerved by the way everyone looks at him. Harker sets off for the rest of his journey and arrives at the Borgo Pass where he's picked up by the Count's mysterious coachman. Harker debarks at Castle Dracula, and the coach immediately rushes off. Somewhat hesitantly, Harker approaches the main door, whereupon a thin, tall, gaunt old man opens it. Harker asks, \\"Count Dracula?\\" \\"I am Dracula, enter freely and of your own will,\\" says the man at the door. Dracula takes Harker to his bedchamber where Harker notices that Dracula casts no reflection. Later, Harker goes to sleep. He wakes in an ancient crypt where he is seduced by three beautiful vampiresses. Dracula rushes into the room in a rage and orders them to leave Harker alone. Dracula explains, \\"This man belongs to me,\\" then gives the vampiresses a baby to feed on. Harker wakes up screaming in his room and assumes it was a nightmare, but two small wounds on his neck indicate otherwise. Harker soon realises he is a prisoner, and tries to escape by climbing out of his bedroom window. He finds his way back to the crypt where Count Dracula and his three brides rest in coffins.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Parts of a Neuron As you learned in the first section, the main part of a neuron is the cell body, which is also known as the soma (soma = “body”). The cell body contains the nucleus and most of the major organelles. But what makes neurons special is that they have many extensions of their cell membranes, which are generally referred to as processes. Neurons are usually described as having one, and only one, axon—a fiber that emerges from the cell body and projects to target cells. That single axon can branch repeatedly to communicate with many target cells. It is the axon that propagates the nerve impulse, which is communicated to one or more cells. The other processes of the neuron are dendrites, which receive information from other neurons at specialized areas of contact called synapses. The dendrites are usually highly branched processes, providing locations for other neurons to communicate with the cell body. Information flows through a neuron from the dendrites, across the cell body, and down the axon. This gives the neuron a polarity—meaning that information flows in this one direction. Figure 12.8 shows the relationship of these parts to one another.   Q: Which part of a neuron contains the nucleus and most of the major organelles?   A:","output":"The cell body, also known as the soma, contains the nucleus and most of the major organelles."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a summary based on this article: 4 White Supremacists Face Federal Charges In California Attacks      Enlarge this image toggle caption Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images      Four Southern California men, allegedly part of a white supremacist group, have been charged by federal prosecutors for violent attacks on counterprotesters, journalists and a police officer at political rallies across the state.      Three of the four are in custody.      The New York Times reports that Robert Rundo, 28 was taken into custody on Sunday at the Los Angeles International Airport after fleeing to Central America earlier this month.      Robert Boman, 25, and Tyler Laube, 22, were arrested Wednesday morning. Authorities are searching for the fourth man — Aaron Eason, 38.      The criminal complaint, filed by the FBI out of Los Angeles on Saturday and unsealed on Wednesday, alleges the four are part of the white supremacist Rise Above Movement.      RAM subscribes to a racist, anti-Semitic ideology and trains its members in combat. The group \\"represents itself publicly as a combat-ready, militant group of a new nationalist white supremacy/identity movement,\\" the complaint says.      \\"The allegations describe an orchestrated effort to squelch free speech as members of the conspiracy traveled to multiple locations to attack those who hold different views,\\" said U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna in a news release.      Videos recorded by journalists, bystanders and surveillance cameras, as well as posts on the Internet from the group's members and private social media communications between them, helped the Department of Justice build its case.      The DOJ alleges the four men violated federal conspiracy and riot statutes in a series of incidents from March to June of 2017.      At a Make America Great Again rally in Huntington Beach in March, the DOJ said in its criminal complaint, members of RAM attacked two journalists and a number of counterprotesters.      Video footage shows Laube punched one journalist three times in the face, after the reporter was jostled by other rally attendees and stumbled backwards.      The Daily Stormer — a neo-Nazi website and online community — praised the violence. \\"Front page of the stormer we did it fam,\\" one RAM member texted another.      In the weeks after the attacks, members allegedly gleefully celebrated the attacks and recruited others to attend an upcoming rally in Berkeley, as well as a training session in hand-to-hand combat before the gathering.      At that April rally, Rundo, Boman and Easaon assaulted people at the rally. Videos show group members with taped hands — like boxers — punching counterprotesters. In one attack, a RAM member held down a counterprotester while another landed punches. Rundo was arrested for punching a \\"defenseless person\\" and a police officer.      \\"Total Aryan victory,\\" a RAM member texted another member the next day.      RAM members again celebrated their assaults, according to the complaint. They posted photos of members holding up a banner celebrating they stole from counterprotesters. On social media, Boman posted several photos of himself attacking others and of RAM members engaged in combat training.      In June, the white supremacists attended an \\"Anti-Islamic Law\\" rally in San Bernardino, where they carried out more attacks. Three RAM members not indicted in this case were arrested.      Wednesday's charges follows the arrests earlier this month of another four RAM members — Benjamin Daley, Michael Miselis, Thomas Gillen and Cole White — who were charged on conspiracy to riot charges for attacking counterprotesters during last year's Unite The Right rally in Charlottesville, Va.      The California charges describe connections between both sets of defendants.      Between April and August of 2017, the complaint alleges, RAM members \\"engaged in regular combat training sessions\\" before attending the Unite the Right rally.      They also \\"used the internet to coordinate combat training in preparation for the events, to arrange travel to the events, to coordinate attendance at the events, and to celebrate their acts of violence in order to recruit members for future events,\\" the complaint said.      Members documented their extremist ideology in public Internet posts, including their affinity of the \\"14 words\\" — \\"a mantra known and used by white supremacy extremists and neo-Nazis,\\" FBI Special Agent Scott Bierwirth said in the complaint.      Also according to the California affidavit, Rundo and two men charged in the Charlottesville case flew to Europe last spring to celebrate Adolf Hitler's birthday. There, they met with other white supremacy groups. ||||| WASHINGTON — The F.B.I. arrested the leader of a violent California neo-Nazi gang on a federal conspiracy charge after he fled the country earlier this month.      Robert Rundo, 28, of Huntington Beach, Calif., is being held at the federal jail in downtown Los Angeles. He was charged in a criminal complaint that was unsealed Tuesday.      Mr. Rundo apparently crossed into Mexico two weeks ago from California and then made his way to Central America. He was later brought back to the United States, where he was arrested Sunday at Los Angeles International Airport, according to two people familiar with the case who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.      He is the founder of the Rise Above Movement, a neo-Nazi gang based in Southern California whose members were involved in violent activity at protests throughout California in 2017. He and three other Californians associated with the group — Robert Boman, 25, Tyler Laube, 22, and Aaron Eason, 38 — were charged with inciting riots, according to court documents. Mr. Boman and Mr. Laube were arrested on Tuesday morning in Southern California. The F.B.I. said it was still searching for Mr. Eason. ||||| Image copyright Reuters Image caption Robert Rundo was said to have been at the Charlottesville event last year that shocked the nation      The leader of a white supremacist group based in California has been arrested and charged with inciting riots.      Robert Rundo, co-founder of the Rise Above Movement, was arrested at LA International Airport on Sunday.      Three others have also been charged, one of whom remains at large.      The four are accused of travelling to events across California and to one in Charlottesville, Virginia, last year that led to the death of a woman and shocked the nation.      Earlier this month, four other members of the Rise Above Movement were charged with attacking counter-protesters at the Unite the Right march in Charlottesville in August 2017.      A woman died after a man drove into a crowd of counter-protesters.      The New York Times says Mr Rundo, 28, had crossed into Mexico and was \\"brought back\\" to the United States to be arrested at LA airport.      Fellow Rise Above Movement members Robert Boman, 25, and Tyler Laube, 22, were arrested on Wednesday while Aaron Eason, 38, remains at large.      The US Attorney's Office alleges they acted with \\"intent to incite, organise, promote, encourage, participate in, or carry on riots\\".      Three of the four, including Mr Rundo, are accused of attacking counter-protesters and journalists at a Make America Great Again rally in Huntington Beach, California, in March.

Dietz's Indian heritage was first contested in 1916 after former neighbors who settled on the Pacific Coast heard he was posing as an Indian. In December 1918 the Federal Bureau of Investigation looked into his heritage after he fraudulently registered for the draft as a \\"Non-Citizen Indian\\" with an allotment. The Bureau found he had taken on the identity of James One Star, an Oglala man of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation 12 years his senior who had disappeared in Cuba in 1894. Dietz also claimed he was the head of an American film company that produced propaganda films for the war.  Dietz divorced De Cora in November 1918, charging her with abandonment. It is not clear how much she knew about his true identity. She died six days after his indictment.  Dietz was tried in Spokane, Washington in June 1919 for the first offense. One Star's sister, Sallie Eaglehorse, testified after seeing him for the first time at the trial that Dietz was definitely not her brother. Still, the judge instructed the jury to determine whether Dietz \\"believed\\" he was an Indian, not whether it was true. Despite that others had witnessed his birth in the summer of 1884 or had seen him the following day, Dietz's mother Leanna claimed he was the Indian son of her husband who had been switched a week or more after she had a stillbirth. Dietz's acting ability along with his mother's fallacious testimony (to protect him from prison) resulted in a hung jury, but Dietz was immediately re-indicted.

Read the following context and answer the question. Context: It's axiomatic that all cultures reserve a special place for food in their daily and social lives. For something as simple as a cuppa joe, we schedule and juggle our time to meet at predetermined locations to share conversation and libation. Meals require even more effort and the social ramifications increase. One is expected to show up on time, sometimes dress to certain standards and bring one or many bottles of wine as a thoughtful gift to the hosts. And of course, the food is just an excuse to get together with friends to enjoy a meal, share stories, to discuss or seduce, to seal an agreement or act as a prelude to a severance of relations (frequently unintentionally). I was first introduced to dining for pleasure as opposed to sustenance while at the University of New Brunswick. I lived in Bridges House, one of the men's residences. The young, eager, bright-eyed students in each residence were kept more or less in check by a Don. Each residence had its share of maniacs and troublemakers who were at university to get some form of education, alcohol poisoning or a social disease; sometimes all three. The Don's job was to act as a mentor and prison warden. Imagine a building housing up to 100 young adult men. It doesn't take much to start a riot. In our case, the Don was Locutus. When we met him, he must have been in his forties but looked to us adolescents to be older than Father Time. He was immediately dubbed 'Grandpa Munster'. With the tender sensitivity of males of our age, we didn't bother to hide this from him and he took it in good humour.

However, the core ideas and methods for preparation remain similar. Here is a detailed plan for preparing for the GATE exam in a limited time frame and optimizing your chances of success: 1. Know your syllabus and exam pattern: For GATE preparation, the first and foremost thing to do is to understand the GATE syllabus for the specific stream you are planning to appear for (in this case, Computer Science). Familiarize yourself with the exam pattern, including the time duration, number of questions, and marking scheme, etc. 2. Collect study material: Gather the best and most relevant study materials, books, and resources for GATE preparation. Consult seniors, teachers, or online forums to find the most recommended materials. For Computer Science, popular authors and books include Cormen for Algorithms, Galvin for Operating Systems, and Tanenbaum for Computer Networks, among others. 3. Make a study schedule: Based on the time constraint of 3 or 5 months and the GATE syllabus, create a daily or weekly study schedule, assigning time for each subject and topic. Stick to the schedule as faithfully as possible and keep track of your progress. 4. Strengthen your basics: Focus on strengthening your fundamentals in each subject. Make sure to go through core concepts, definitions, and theorems, as GATE questions often test these aspects. In case of doubts, consult reliable sources or seek help from teachers and peers. 5. Practice problems: Solve a variety of problems from each topic, including previous years' GATE questions and problems from recommended books. This will help you develop a better understanding of the concepts and improve your problem-solving ability. 6. Test series and mock examinations: Join a reputed test series or attempt mock examinations in a timed environment. This will give you an idea of the actual examination process, help you improve your time management, and familiarize you with the online interface used in the GATE exam. 7. Analyze performance: After taking mock tests or solving practice problems, analyze your weaker and stronger areas. Work upon improving areas where you are facing difficulty and allocate more time to those subjects. 8. Revision: Periodically revise the topics you have covered. Make short notes or flashcards to help you with quick revisions. Consistently revising concepts ensures that the topics are fresh in your mind. 9. Stay motivated and positive: Stay focused, motivated, and maintain a positive attitude throughout your GATE preparation. Take breaks, eat healthily, and exercise regularly to stay mentally and physically fit. In conclusion, although the questions do not have exactly the same meaning, the approach to prepare for the GATE examination remains similar. Analyzing the time constraint and subject, planning, practicing, and being consistent in your efforts are the key takeaways for success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What two movements did the man who taught a variety of positions help influence toward the end of his life?, using the article: Lazar Markovich Lissitzky (Russian: Ла́зарь Ма́ркович Лиси́цкий, listen ; November 23 [O.S. November 11] 1890 – December 30, 1941), known as El Lissitzky (Russian: Эль Лиси́цкий, Yiddish: על ליסיצקי‎), was a Russian artist, designer, photographer, typographer, polemicist and architect. He was an important figure of the Russian avant-garde, helping develop suprematism with his mentor, Kazimir Malevich, and designing numerous exhibition displays and propaganda works for the Soviet Union. His work greatly influenced the Bauhaus and constructivist movements, and he experimented with production techniques and stylistic devices that would go on to dominate 20th-century graphic design.Lissitzky's entire career was laced with the belief that the artist could be an agent for change, later summarized with his edict, \\"das zielbewußte Schaffen\\" (goal-oriented creation). Lissitzky, of Lithuanian Jewish оrigin, began his career illustrating Yiddish children's books in an effort to promote Jewish culture in Russia. When only 15 he started teaching, a duty he would maintain for most of his life. Over the years, he taught in a variety of positions, schools, and artistic media, spreading and exchanging ideas. He took this ethic with him when he worked with Malevich in heading the suprematist art group UNOVIS, when he developed a variant suprematist series of his own, Proun, and further still in 1921, when he took up a job as the Russian cultural ambassador to Weimar Germany, working with and influencing important figures of the Bauhaus and De Stijl movements during his stay. In his remaining years he brought significant innovation and change to typography, exhibition design, photomontage, and book design, producing critically respected works and winning international acclaim for his exhibition design. This continued until his deathbed, where in 1941 he produced one of his last works – a Soviet propaganda poster rallying the people to construct more tanks for the fight against Nazi Germany. In 2014, the heirs of the artist, in..., what would be the answer ? The answer is:","output":"The two movements that the man who taught a variety of positions helped influence towards the end of his life were the Bauhaus and constructivist movements. El Lissitzky, a Russian artist, designer, photographer, typographer, polemicist, and architect, played a significant role in the Russian avant-garde and contributed to the development of suprematism alongside his mentor, Kazimir Malevich. He designed numerous exhibition displays and propaganda works for the Soviet Union, and his work had a profound impact on both the Bauhaus and constructivist movements. Furthermore, he experimented with production techniques and stylistic devices that went on to dominate 20th-century graphic design. Throughout his career, Lissitzky held a strong belief that an artist could be an agent of change. He began his career illustrating Yiddish children's books to promote Jewish culture in Russia and started teaching at the age of 15, a responsibility he upheld for most of his life. Over the years, he taught in various positions, schools, and artistic media, sharing and exchanging ideas. Lissitzky brought this same work ethic with him when he collaborated with Malevich to lead the suprematist art group UNOVIS, when he developed his own variant suprematist series called Proun, and further still in 1921, when he became the Russian cultural ambassador to Weimar Germany. During his time in Germany, he worked with and influenced significant figures of the Bauhaus and De Stijl movements.

Сигариллы Could you please translate this to English?","output":"The word \\"Сигариллы\\" is a Russian word, which translates to \\"Cigarillos\\" in English. Cigarillos are small, thin cigars that have gained popularity in many parts of the world as a convenient, quick-smoking option compared to larger cigars. They are typically made of finely ground tobacco rolled inside of a tobacco leaf or a tobacco-based wrapper. Originating from Spain, cigarillos became popular in Europe and later in the Americas. Cigarillos come in various lengths, diameters, and flavors. Some cigarillos are flavored, such as vanilla, cherry, or chocolate, while others maintain the natural tobacco taste. They often come pre-cut at both ends, making them ready to smoke without any additional preparation. However, unlike regular cigars, cigarillos are not meant to be inhaled deeply into the lungs, but rather gently sipped and enjoyed for their taste and aroma. Cigarillos are the middle ground between cigarettes and traditional cigars, offering the convenience of a cigarette with the enjoyment of a quality cigar. Smoking a cigarillo usually takes around 15 to 30 minutes depending on the size, which is less time-consuming compared to regular cigars that can take an hour or more to smoke. While cigarillos are often considered less harmful than cigarettes due to the absence of added chemicals and filters, it is still important to remember that any form of tobacco smoking carries health risks. Thus, moderation and awareness are key when enjoying cigarillos or any other tobacco products."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Who was the first king of Rome?","output":"The first king of Rome was Romulus, who, according to Roman mythology, founded the city itself in 753 BC and established its monarchy. The story of Romulus and Remus, his twin brother, is tied to the very origins of Rome, making it a combination of history and legend that has been passed down through generations for centuries. Romulus and Remus were the sons of Rhea Silvia and Mars, the god of war. Rhea Silvia was the daughter of Numitor, the king of Alba Longa, an ancient Latin city southeast of Rome. Numitor's younger brother, Amulius, seized the throne and forced Rhea Silvia to become a Vestal Virgin to prevent her from conceiving any potential heirs. However, Mars impregnated her, resulting in the birth of Romulus and Remus. Fearing for their survival, Rhea Silvia placed the twins in a basket and sent them down the River Tiber. The boys were discovered by a she-wolf, who had just lost her litter of cubs. She cared for the twins, nursing and protecting them until they were found by a shepherd named Faustulus and his wife, Acca Larentia. The couple took the boys in and raised them as their own. As the twins grew older, they learned of their true heritage and their connection to the royal family of Alba Longa. They decided to overthrow their great-uncle Amulius and restore Numitor to the throne. After accomplishing this, Romulus and Remus set out to establish their city. However, a dispute arose between the two about where they should build their new city. Romulus wanted it to be on the Palatine Hill, while Remus supported the Aventine Hill. They sought the opinion of the gods through augury, a form of divination that involved observing the movements of birds. Each brother saw a different number of birds and claimed victory, which led to an escalation of their disagreement. The conflict between the brothers reached its peak when Remus, in an act of defiance, jumped over the wall Romulus had built around the city. In response, Romulus killed his brother and assumed complete control of the city's founding, naming it after himself. As the first king of Rome, Romulus established various social, legal, and military structures that would come to define the city and its culture. He created an army and a senate, granting lifelong positions to noble families who supported him. To increase the population of Rome, Romulus welcomed outcasts from surrounding areas, including criminals and refugees. Moreover, he helped facilitate marriages between Roman men and the abducted women of a neighboring tribe, the Sabines, to integrate the tribes and expand his kingdom. Romulus ruled for approximately 37 years until he mysteriously disappeared in a storm (circa 716 BC), an event that some believed signaled his ascension to the status of a deity. Regardless of the veracity of this account, the legacy of Romulus is fondly remembered and revered in Roman mythology and history as the founder and first king of Rome."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What does the genotype cause? Context: The existence of discrete inheritable units was first suggested by Gregor Mendel (1822–1884). From 1857 to 1864, he studied inheritance patterns in 8000 common edible pea plants, tracking distinct traits from parent to offspring. He described these mathematically as 2n combinations where n is the number of differing characteristics in the original peas. Although he did not use the term gene, he explained his results in terms of discrete inherited units that give rise to observable physical characteristics. This description prefigured the distinction between genotype (the genetic material of an organism) and phenotype (the visible traits of that organism). Mendel was also the first to demonstrate independent assortment, the distinction between dominant and recessive traits, the distinction between a heterozygote and homozygote, and the phenomenon of discontinuous inheritance.

Hypothesis: The secretary dismissed the bill.","output":"Step 1: Identify the key elements of the context. From the provided context, the key elements are: - The parliamentary secretary did a fantastic job - The bill went through the House and committee - The filibuster by the Reform Party tried to hinder the bill - The Reform Party does not want to see labor legislation advance in parliament Step 2: Analyze the key elements to determine if they support or contradict the hypothesis. The hypothesis is: \\"The secretary dismissed the bill.\\"  - The fact that the parliamentary secretary did a fantastic job suggests that the secretary was actively working on the bill and not dismissing it. - The bill going through the House and committee shows progress and indicates that it was not dismissed. - The filibuster by the Reform Party tried to hinder the bill, not the secretary. - The Reform Party's opposition to labor legislation is unrelated to the secretary's actions regarding the bill. Step 3: Conclusion Based on the analysis, there is no evidence in the context to support the hypothesis that the secretary dismissed the bill. Instead, the context suggests that the secretary worked hard to advance the bill despite opposition.

Given the question: Information:  - William Clark Gable (February 1, 1901  November 16, 1960) was an American film actor, often referred to as \\"The King of Hollywood\\" or just simply as \\"The King\\". Gable began his career as a stage actor and appeared as an extra in silent films between 1924 and 1926, and progressed to supporting roles with a few films for MGM in 1931. The next year, he landed his first leading Hollywood role and became a leading man in more than 60 motion pictures over the next three decades.  - Film noir is a cinematic term used primarily to describe stylish Hollywood crime dramas, particularly such that emphasize cynical attitudes and sexual motivations. Hollywood's classical film noir period is generally regarded as extending from the early 1940s to the late 1950s. Film noir of this era is associated with a low-key black-and-white visual style that has roots in German Expressionist cinematography. Many of the prototypical stories and much of the attitude of classic noir derive from the hardboiled school of crime fiction that emerged in the United States during the Great Depression.  - The Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) is a drama school in London, England. It is one of the oldest drama schools in the United Kingdom, founded in 1904 by Herbert Beerbohm Tree.  - Oliver Burgess Meredith (November 16, 1907  September 9, 1997), was an American actor, director, producer, and writer in theater, film, and television. Active for more than six decades, Meredith has been called \\"a virtuosic actor\\" and \\"one of the most accomplished actors of the century\\". A life member of the Actors Studio by invitation, he won several Emmys, was the first male actor to win the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor twice, and was nominated for two Academy Awards.  - The Man on the Eiffel Tower is a 1949 American color film noir mystery film directed by Burgess Meredith and starring Charles Laughton , Franchot Tone , Meredith , and Robert Hutton .

Please briefly summarize this news article: GM learns from Toyota how not to handle a crisis has wanted to be more like It wanted to sell more passenger cars like Toyota. It wanted Toyota's reputation for reliability. But in one area, GM is doing everything it can to not be like Toyota. As federal safety officials began investigating the cause of fires that followed test crashes of its Chevrolet Volt electric vehicles, GM shifted into communications overdrive, trotting out senior executives and engineers to talk about the issue and launching a customer-care initiative. Analysts say the Detroit automaker wants to be sure it is not seen as sitting on its hands and downplaying a safety issue — a trap Toyota fell into after a deadly 2009 car crash killed four people and set off fears of sudden uncontrolled acceleration in Toyota and Lexus vehicles. Toyota responded slowly and ineffectually to the growing crisis because it was hampered by a top-down management style that gave short shrift to customer complaints, according to a report by a special Toyota advisory panel in May. GM moved quickly to allay customer fears, said Eric Noble, president of the CarLab, an industry consulting firm in Orange. GM said any Volt owner concerned about safety could borrow a free GM vehicle until the issue is resolved. So far, \\"only a handful\\" of Volt owners have requested loaner vehicles, the automaker said. \\"This is a smart move on GM's part,\\" Noble said, \\"because the total exposure to GM is infinitesimal if you think about the small number of Volts that are out there on the road.\\" The company also is not afraid to talk publicly about the fires. Mark Reuss, the president of GM's North American operations, and Mary Barra, the company's senior vice president of global product development, held a telephone news conference Monday to explain their understanding of the problem, noting that the fires occurred only in test situations up to three weeks after the crashes and that there have been no reports of spontaneous fires or blazes started by collisions. They said GM has \\"a senior engineering team\\" working on \\"changes to eliminate concern of potential post-crash electrical fires.\\" It also is working with the to discover the source of the problem. GM said the fires can be prevented by draining all electricity from the battery before storing the damaged vehicle. (Safety officials drain gas from conventional vehicles destroyed in crashes to prevent fires.) To be sure, fires caused by batteries in electric vehicles weeks after a crash test aren't nearly as severe a crisis as what Toyota faced, but GM and the rest of the auto industry want to avoid being seen as unresponsive. \\"Toyota was studying its problem and tried to determine what the problem was, but they kept studying and didn't communicate,\\" said Jeremy Anwyl, chief executive of auto information company Edmunds.com. \\"And what the automakers learned is that in today's world that's not always good. You have to communicate before you have all the facts.\\" The lesson applies to any manufacturer of a consumer product, especially if there is a safety issue. \\"The expectations around candor and transparency are awfully high,\\" Anwyl said. GM appears to be following an old Toyota playbook. Soon after launching its Lexus luxury brand in 1989, Toyota received one complaint of a cruise-control-switch malfunction and learned of an incident in which the lens on a high-mount brake light melted. Fearful that reports of the problems would damage its efforts to portray Lexus as a brand with industry-leading quality, Toyota issued a of about 8,000 LS 400 vehicles in its initial sales. Toyota had Lexus dealers deliver loaners to people's homes, repaired the recalled cars and returned them washed, detailed and with a full tank of gas, according to \\"Satisfaction: How Every Great Company Listens to the Voice of the Customer\\" by Chris Denove and James D. Power IV. Anwyl said the incident became the \\"textbook example of how to handle a recall. People were wowed by how Lexus would go the extra mile.\\"","output":"General Motors (GM) has learned from Toyota's mistakes in handling crises by taking quick action and maintaining open communication with customers regarding the safety investigation of its Chevrolet Volt electric vehicles. After test crashes caused fires in the vehicles, GM proactively addressed the issue, offering Volt owners a free loaner vehicle and assigning a senior engineering team to work on solutions. This quick response contrasts with Toyota's slow and ineffective reaction to the sudden acceleration problem in 2009 that resulted in customer complaints and a severely damaged reputation. Analysts argue that proper communication and transparency are essential when facing safety issues, as seen in GM's successful handling of the situation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: In many cases, you can allow the pregnancy to proceed normally, but make sure you have a vet on hand in case there are complications, which are more likely if your pig is older or younger or has not given birth previously. Try to find a vet who specializes in rodents and other small animals, rather than just a generic vet. If you have multiple sows, remove the male pig immediately to prevent others from becoming pregnant. Even if this is the only sow you own, you should still remove the male pig before she reaches 60 days in her pregnancy. It is best to house the male in an adjacent cage where he can still be close to the female.  A male guinea pig who can not see or hear his mate may develop stress, making him susceptible to illness.  Male guinea pigs will continue to mount pregnant sows, which can cause stress or pain to your pregnant sow late in the pregnancy (after the 50-day mark). She could also become pregnancy just two hours after she gives birth. You'll want to make sure your pig is getting sufficient food, water, and nutrients since these things are also helping the fetuses develop.  Feed your guinea pig alfalfa hay instead of timothy hay so that she gets more protein and calcium. Your pregnant sow will also need more vitamin C after 4 weeks, about twice as much, so incorporate more fresh fruits and vegetables high in vitamin C into her diet. In addition, you may want to increase your guinea pig's fiber intake. Increased fiber intake can prevent hair thinning, which is common in the last stage of pregnancy. You should weigh your guinea pig twice a week to make sure that is gaining weight (and not losing it) and is generally healthy (e.g., eating all her food, still social and interactive, etc.) and check she's healthy. If at any point her weight begins to fall or if she begins to show signs of illness, consult a vet immediately. Try to make your guinea pig's life follow a routine so as to minimize stress, which can aggravate the dangers that accompany guinea pig pregnancy.  Avoid making changes to a pregnant sow's cage, like removing toys or putting the cage in a totally new location. This could increase her stress and affect her eating and drinking habits.  Reduce her exposure to loud noises or bright lights, including direct sunlight. Reduce handling to a minimum and don't handle her within two weeks of the birth. Note that the gestation period is usually 66 - 72 days.","output":"When a guinea pig is pregnant, it is important to take care of her well. Make sure to check on her with a special animal doctor, called a vet, who knows about small animals. Keep the dad guinea pig away from the mom after 60 days, but still close by so they won't get sad or sick. Give the mom guinea pig more good food, like alfalfa hay and fruits and vegetables with lots of vitamin C. Check her weight and health often, and ask the vet for help if she's not doing well. Keep her life very calm and avoid making big changes, so she won't feel stressed. Be very gentle with her and let her be more on her own close to when the babies are coming. The babies will be born after about 66 to 72 days."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Article: An Army wife filed a lawsuit against the government on Monday, claiming that her opera career is in jeopardy after an Army nurse botched her childbirth operation.      According to a report by Army Times, Amy Herbst and her husband allege that a nurse-midwife at Blanchfield Army Community Hospital at Fort Campbell, Ky., caused significant damage to Herbst’s digestive and reproductive system’s during the birth of her son in February 2012.      The lawsuit claims that the nurse performed an episiotomy during the second stage of Herbst’s labor without the new mom’s consent or knowledge. An episiotomy is an incision that a doctor or nurse makes in the perineum – the area between the vagina and anus – to help deliver a baby that is in distress or to prevent muscles from tearing.      The nurse-midwife reportedly repaired the episiotomy with sutures, but after Herbst left the hospital, she “began to experience fecal urgency and incontinence, including periodic leaking of stool and excessive flatulence,” the suit states. Herbst claims that upon returning to the hospital, another nurse told her that attempts to repair the cut had been unsuccessful, and a colorectal surgeon told her she would need reconstructive surgery to fix the damage.      Because of the complications of the procedure, Herbst says she is unable to continuing working as a professional opera singer at the Nashville Opera Company.      “She is suffering though a very embarrassing and very significant injury, and frankly, the prognosis of a fully successful repair is pretty low,” Herbst’s attorney, Charles Allen, told Army Times.      When asked by Army Times for a comment on the pending lawsuit, a spokesperson for Blanchfield declined to remark on the specific case. However, the spokesperson said that the hospital is deeply concerned with its patients’ outcomes.      “The Blanchfield Army Community Hospital staff always strives to provide high quality, safe and accessible health care that fully complies with all applicable standards of care,” the spokesperson said.

Step 2: First, simplify the equation. Anything multiplied by zero is zero, so 0*h equals 0. Now, our equation looks like this: 0 = 4*h - 16. Step 3:  Next, make 4*h - 16 equal to 0 because from our previous step, we have the equation 0 = 4*h - 16, from which we can easily isolate the term with h. So, 4*h - 16 = 0. Step 4: To isolate h, we should first move the -16 (the constant on the left side) to the right by adding 16 to both sides of the equation.  When we do so, our equation becomes: 4*h = 16. Step 5: Finally, to get h alone, we need to cancel out the multiplication of 4. Since the opposite operation of multiplication is division, we divide both sides by 4: 4*h/4 = 16/4, h = 4.

John coughed himself awake on the bank of the lake where he and Bill had their play. How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence? Select from: (i) unacceptable. (ii) acceptable.","output":"I would consider the linguistic integrity of the given sentence as acceptable. Here's an analysis of why: The structure of the sentence is relatively straightforward. It consists of two clauses, which combine together to present ideas that are both coherent and logically connected. Mentions of the two characters, the main action, and the location effectively set up the scene for the reader. The clause \\"John coughed himself awake on the bank of the lake\\" is particularly interesting due to the use of the reflexive pronoun \\"himself\\" which highlights that John's coughing eventually led to his awakening. This combination of coughing and waking up has an underlying sense of cause-and-effect and creates a vivid imagery for readers, engaging their interest. The second clause \\"where he and Bill had their play\\" provides further context, specifying the location of the scene. Clarifying the characters' relationship as companions and playmates, it conveys the idea that John and Bill were engaging in some form of activity by the lakeside before the described event took place. The variety in sentence structure - in this case, a combination of the two clauses - works well to keep the readers engaged while ensuring the information is conveyed effectively. No grammatical errors can be identified in the given sentence. Therefore, the linguistic integrity can be considered acceptable due to the overall success in the arrangement of words and phrases to convey a clear scene to the reader."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Teacher:You're given a fill-in-the-blank question where the answer is PersonX. You need to minimally change the given question so that the answer flips to PersonY. This task typically involves replacing one word i.e., the 'trigger word' with its antonym (e.g., changing from \\"sympathetic\\" to \\"stern\\"). You should not change any content in the given question beyond a word or two i.e. the trigger word/phrase. PersonX and PersonY should not be equally likely to fill the blank. For your question, PersonY should be a well-agreed answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use the names of real people or generic names (e.g., Donald Trump, John Doe, etc.) in your question. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in generating your modified question e.g. this task can be always solved using a simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase the word diversity. Your question must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Your question must have at least 70% overlapping words with the given question. You must utilize the given context word while writing the question. Your question must contain only one blank. Make sure that PersonX and PersonY have the same gender.

Example: PersonX wanted to remove trees in his front yard unlike PersonY because _ likes to live in an enclosed space. Explanation: I replaced \\"plant\\" with \\"remove\\" to flip the roles of PersonX and PersonY in the situation, making PersonY the one preferring an enclosed space. Part #2: Ensure PersonY is a well-agreed answer. Usage: Make sure PersonY is the correct choice given the context. Example: PersonX wanted to remove trees in his front yard unlike PersonY because _ likes to live in an enclosed space.

You are given a new situation: Two brothers have a piece of land each, situated 2 miles from each other. Jim's land is not very fertile because it has clay soil with a high pH, while Bob's land has very fertile soil and has a good productivity on it.  and a hint : Alkali, or Alkaline, soils are clay soils with high pH (> 8.5), a poor soil structure and a low infiltration capacity. Often they have a hard calcareous layer at 0.5 to 1 metre depth. Alkali soils owe their unfavorable physico-chemical properties mainly to the dominating presence of sodium carbonate, which causes the soil to swell[1] and difficult to clarify/settle. They derive their name from the alkali metal group of elements, to which sodium belongs, and which can induce basicity. Sometimes these soils are also referred to as alkaline sodic soils. Alkaline soils are basic, but not all basic soils are alkaline.  Please answer this question : Which of the two pieces of land is more acidic? Answer:","output":"To determine which piece of land is more acidic, we need to compare the pH levels of the soils present on Jim's and Bob's lands. We know that Jim's land has clay soil with a high pH (> 8.5). The hint provided about alkali or alkaline soils also states that they have high pH levels (> 8.5). This implies that Jim's land is alkaline, and since the pH is above 7 (neutral), it is basic, not acidic. On the other hand, Bob's land has very fertile soil and good productivity. While we don't have an exact pH value, it is reasonable to infer that the soil on Bob's land is not alkaline, as alkaline soils have poor structure and low infiltration capacity. This means that the pH of Bob's soil could be closer to neutral (pH 7) or acidic (pH < 7).

Her Muslim boyfriend Tarek is planning to leave Egypt on an illegal boat-crossing to Italy. Amal tells Tarek she is pregnant but he gives her an ultimatum - abandon the country with him, or have an abortion.Amal, who loves Tarek and wants the baby, rejects both choices. But when the battered scooter she uses for food deliveries is stolen. Amal is fired from her job and suddenly finds herself with even fewer options. Her future, limited from the start, looks even more uncertain. In the poor neighborhood of Bashtel where Amal lives with her mother and a step-father who is a compulsive gambler, day-to-day existence is difficult for everyone. Her sister, Hanan, is also an unwed mother with few paths to a better life.Her best friend, Rania, is trying to raise money for an operation that will disguise the fact that she is no longer a virgin so that she can marry an wealthy, older man whom she does not love. Amal seeks guidance in prayers to the Virgin Mary, but with few real possibilities left, she takes the only job she can find - in a hair dresser with low pay. The new job opens up the underworld life within Cairo that Amal never imagined - a life of luxury, leisure, expensive homes and cars - but also one of vice.

For the most part, jogging can be a healthy way to stay fit. However, problems can also develop for those who jog in the heat. Excessive sweating can lead to electrolyte loss that could be life-threatening. Early symptoms of electrolyte deficiency can include nausea, fatugue, and dizziness. If not treated, individuals can experience muscle weakness and increased heart rate (which could lead to a heart attack). Many sports drinks can be consumed to restore electrolytes quickly in the body.  Now, I have a new situation: The Jones family went jogging  last Saturday. The weather was great for running, a bit chilly. The Brown family went jogging on Sunday and the weather was hot and humid, so it was tough for them, plus they forgot their Gatorade at home.  Answer this question please: Which family experienced more nausea?","output":"Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the Brown family experienced more nausea while jogging due to the hot and humid weather conditions. While running, their bodies would have been producing increased amounts of sweat to cool down, which can lead to electrolyte loss. As mentioned, early symptoms of electrolyte deficiency can include nausea, fatigue, and dizziness. Since the weather conditions were more challenging for the Brown family and they forgot to bring their Gatorade, which is a sports drink that could have helped replenish their electrolytes, their risk of experiencing symptoms related to electrolyte loss, including nausea, would have been higher than the Jones family. In comparison, the Jones family jogged in cooler weather conditions, which would have resulted in less sweating and therefore less risk of electrolyte loss. As a result, the chances of the Jones family experiencing nausea due to electrolyte deficiency would likely have been lower than the Brown family in this situation. It is important to note that while this answer is based on the provided context, individual exercise tolerance, overall health, and personal fitness levels could also be factors affecting the experience of nausea. Additionally, other factors, such as food intake or hydration before the jogging activity, could also play a role in determining the risk of nausea in each family; however, these factors were not mentioned in the given context. Overall, based on the information available, it can be reasonably assumed that the Brown family experienced more nausea during their jogging session."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

However, it would be wrong to dismiss the long history of the region itself. Archaeologists today are working to uncover Hong Kong's past, which stretches back thousands of years. You can get a glimpse into that past at Lei Cheng Uk Museum's 1,600-year-old burial vault on the mainland just north of Kowloon. In 1992, when construction of the airport on Chek Lap Kok was begun, a 2,000-year-old village, Pak Mong, was discovered, complete with artifacts that indicated a sophisticated rural society. An even older Stone Age site was discovered on Lamma Island in 1996. While Hong Kong remained a relative backwater in early days, nearby Guangzhou (Canton) was developing into a great trading city with connections in India and the Middle East. By a.d. 900, the Hong Kong islands had become a lair for pirates preying on the shipping in the Pearl River Delta and causing a major headache for burgeoning Guangzhou; small bands of pirates were still operating into the early years of the 20th century. In the meantime, the mainland area was being settled by incomers, the \\"Five Great Clans\\": Tang, Hau, Pang, Liu, and Man. First to arrive was the Tang clan, which established a number of walled villages in the New Territories that still exist today. You can visit Kat Hing Wai and Lo Wai, villages with their walls still intact. Adjacent to Lo Wai is the Tang Chung Ling Ancestral Hall, built in the 16th century, which is still the center of clan activities. The first Europeans to arrive in the Pearl River Delta were the Portuguese, who settled in Macau in 1557 and for several centuries had a monopoly on trade between Asia, Europe, and South America. As Macau developed into the greatest port in the East, it also became a base for Jesuit missionaries; it was later a haven for persecuted Japanese Christians. While Christianity was not a great success in China, it made local headway, evidenced today by the numerous Catholic churches in Macau's historic center. Intermarriage with the local Chinese created a community of Macanese, whose culture can still be seen in Macau's architecture and cuisine.

Marriage criteria began to weigh intelligence and education as desirable attributes in a wife, right along with physical attractiveness. Though many of the texts written for women during the Tokugawa period only pertained to how a woman could become a successful wife and household manager, there were those that undertook the challenge of learning to read, and also tackled philosophical and literary classics.

Title: One Eight Seven Movie plot: Trevor Garfield is an African American high school science teacher at Roosevelt Whitney High School, a high school in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. Dennis Broadway, a gangster student to whom he had given a failing grade threatens to murder him, writing the number 187 (the California police code for homicide) on every page in a textbook. The administration ignores the threat, and Dennis ambushes Garfield in the hallway, stabbing him in the back and side abdominal area multiple times with a shiv. Fifteen months after surviving, Garfield, now a substitute teacher, has relocated to John Quincy Adams High School in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, but trouble starts again when he substitutes an unruly class of rejects, including a Chicano tag crew by the name of \\"Kappin' Off Suckers\\" (K.O.S.). Their leader, Benito \\"Benny\\" ChacÃ³n, a felon attending high school as a condition of probation, makes it clear to Garfield that there will be no mutual respect. The tension mounts when a fellow teacher, Ellen Henry, confides that Benny has threatened her life, an action against which the administration of the school refuses to take action, fearing legal threats. After Benny murders a rival tagger in cold blood, he disappears, and Benny's unstable tag partner, CÃ©sar, takes over as leader. When CÃ©sar steals Garfield's family heirloom watch, the principal is more concerned about a lawsuit and refuses to take action. Ellen and Garfield develop a close friendship that approaches the beginnings of a relationship, but is stymied by Garfield's destabilizing behavior and his confrontations with the K.O.S.. Garfield's past garners the unwanted admiration of Dave Childress, an alcoholic history teacher who carries guns at the school. The conflict between Garfield and the K.O.S. escalates with the killing of Jack, Ellen's dog. CÃ©sar, after spraying cartoon graffiti depicting a dead dog, is shot with a syringe filled with morphine attached to the end of an arrow. He passes out, and wakes up to find one...

While it’s cliché to infer they have motor oil coursing through their veins, their interest in all things vehicular run much deeper than the mere act of getting from one location to another. If that describes your dear old dad, here’s a look at a few can’t-miss gifts that are guaranteed to make his heart race this Father’s Day: • One way to get dad’s hard-working hands on an exotic sports car for a fraction of the cost is to upgrade his or her computer mouse with a racier model, a Porsche 911 to be exact. The Motormouse is a 2.4g wireless mouse that’s a strikingly detailed replica of the iconic coupe. Both PC and Mac compatible, it comes in five colors for 50 from www.motormouse.us.com. MINI Cooper versions are also available. • Whatever dad drives you can upgrade it to at least sound like a Ferrari, thanks to the Soundracer. This device plugs into a 12-volt power point and replicates a sports car engine’s roar through the car’s audio system via a built in FM transmitter. And it does so in perfect sync with the vehicle’s actual accelerations and decelerations. It also doubles as an audio adapter for MP3 players. Offered in V8 and V10-engine versions, it’s available at select auto accessory retailers for 40. (www.soundracer.se) • Those dads who like to – literally – wear their affection for autos on their sleeves will enjoy a pair of car-themed cufflinks that run the gamut from shift knobs, tires, spark plugs and dashboard gauges to headlamps and road signs. A selection of 32 sets range in price from 45 to 425/pair from www.cufflinks.com (many are also sold at Nordstrom, Saks, Neiman Marcus and other retailers. • Ideal for a dad who’s both an auto enthusiast and is environmentally conscious is Green Earth Technologies Car Care Kit. It consists of five eco-friendly products made from plant oils: organic glass cleaner, brake dust shield, hydrophobic car wash, tire shine and wheel cleaner. Widely available, it retails for 20. (www.getg.com) • Leading the race to build a better travel mug is the aptly named Brugo, which is designed to eliminate both spills and scalded lips. A “tip and cool” mode allows users to transfer small amounts of too-hot take-out beverages to a temperature-controlled chamber, where it cools down a gulp at a time to a “perfect” 150 to 170 degrees. Once the beverage has cooled to a palatable temperature, dad can switch the Brugo into “sip” mode and drink it directly. Offered in “Executive,” “Jazz” and “Sport” versions, Brugo mugs are available nationwide for 15 and 20. (www.brugomug.com) • Making driving safer and more convenient is the Belkin Tunebase with Hands-Free, which allows iPhone and iPod Touch owners to conduct hands-free conversations through their car stereo systems. Sold through electronics retailers, the 70 “Direct” version connects through an auxiliary audio input jack (found on later model cars), while the 100 “FM” model transmits to an unused FM radio station. It also streams music stored on the iPhone/iPod and allows users to charge up to two mobile devices while en route. A unique cradle design allows easy operation. (www.belkin.com) • Another hands-free calling adapter – this one using Bluetooth wireless connectivity – can additionally help prevent dad from losing his cellphone. The diminutive ZOMM attaches to a keychain and essentially acts as a “wireless leash” that will flash, vibrate and even sound an alarm if an owner walks away from his or her phone. It also includes a panic button to call local emergency services and send help to the phone’s location via an automatic message. It’s available in either black or white directly from the manufacturer or at electronics dealers for 100.

Question: \\"Why did Cubitt build the new wing?\\"  Context: \\"By 1847, the couple had found the palace too small for court life and their growing family, and consequently the new wing, designed by Edward Blore, was built by Thomas Cubitt, enclosing the central quadrangle. The large East Front, facing The Mall, is today the \\"public face\\" of Buckingham Palace, and contains the balcony from which the royal family acknowledge the crowds on momentous occasions and after the annual Trooping the Colour. The ballroom wing and a further suite of state rooms were also built in this period, designed by Nash's student Sir James Pennethorne.\\"  Answer:","output":"Thomas Cubitt was commissioned to build the new wing at Buckingham Palace in the mid-19th century for several reasons. The primary reason was the lack of space and the need for expansion, as the palace had become too small for the growing family of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, as well as for the demands of daily court life. Additionally, the desire to have a more impressive and functional palace for hosting important events and accommodating state guests also played a key role in the decision to build a new wing. The existing palace structure, despite the prior renovations and expansions by architects such as John Nash and Edward Blore, was still insufficient for the needs and expectations of the British monarchy. The new wing was designed by Edward Blore, an architect with significant experience in designing royal buildings, and was constructed by Thomas Cubitt, a well-respected builder who had achieved great success through his innovative techniques and high-quality materials. The new wing built by Cubitt enclosed the central quadrangle of the palace and greatly expanded its available space. It allowed for the creation of the large East Front which faces The Mall, a famous landmark in central London. This facade has become the \\"public face\\" of Buckingham Palace and now serves as the primary entrance for official state visits and other important events. The balcony on the East Front is used by the royal family to acknowledge the crowds on momentous occasions, such as after weddings, the birth of a new family member, or national celebrations. Additionally, the expansion allowed for the inclusion of the much-needed ballroom wing and further suite of state rooms, designed by Sir James Pennethorne, a student of John Nash. This addition of grand, beautifully appointed spaces enabled the palace to host lavish state banquets, royal receptions, and other significant gatherings. The improved facilities greatly increased the palace's capacity to accommodate important guests and reinforced its status as the epicenter of British royal residence and official functions. In conclusion, Thomas Cubitt was commissioned to build the new wing at Buckingham Palace in response to the growing needs of the British royal family and the requirements of maintaining the monarchy's status and image. The construction of the new wing expanded the available space within the palace, providing additional state rooms, a grand ballroom, and the iconic East Front with its balcony for the royal family to interact with the public on special occasions. This expansion played a crucial role in shaping Buckingham Palace into the iconic symbol of British royalty and national pride that it is today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: A woman with an orange shirt is walking past a 1 hour photo shop. Hypothesis: The lady is thinking about getting some photos developed at the store she is walking near. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","output":"It is not possible to definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true based solely on the premise provided. The premise merely states that a woman wearing an orange shirt is walking past a 1-hour photo shop. This statement does not provide enough information to infer any conclusions about her thoughts or intentions with certainty. In order to evaluate the hypothesis, we need more data or evidence that can provide context to her action. To understand why we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true, let us break down the information available in the premise: 1. A woman is walking. 2. She is wearing an orange shirt. 3. She is passing by a 1-hour photo shop. These pieces of information do not inherently suggest any correlation between the woman's attire (orange shirt), her location (proximity to a photo shop), and her intentions (thinking about getting photos developed). The premise does not mention any action or behavior on the woman's part that could directly link her to the store or the activity of photo development, such as looking in the store window, holding a camera or a roll of film, or conversing with someone about photography. Furthermore, there could be several alternative explanations for the woman's actions. She could be out for a leisurely stroll, on her way to meet someone, or perhaps just walking past the photo shop coincidentally, with no intention of getting photos developed. The color of her shirt has no bearing on her objectives and serves merely as a descriptor; it does not provide any additional information that could strengthen the hypothesis. In conclusion, we cannot verify the hypothesis that the lady is thinking about getting photos developed at the store she is walking near, based solely on the premise provided. To conclusively prove or disprove the hypothesis, we would require more concrete evidence, such as a direct statement of intent from the woman, observable actions linking her to the store or photo development, or any other related contextual information.

Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).  and the situation: Geologists have been contemplating on the question - why some places are more susceptible to earthquakes. To understand the differences, they have made a chart where they divided the earth into two regions, region A and region B. In region A many earthquakes happen, but in region B no earthquakes happen.  Answer the following question: In which region stresses would not build in plates, region A or region B? Answer:","output":"Based on the given background information and the situation presented, region B is the region where stresses would not build in plates or at least not to the extent seen in region A. As mentioned in the background, almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries, and all types of plate boundaries can experience earthquakes. This is due to the convection within Earth's mantle, which causes the tectonic plates to move. The movement of these plates leads to stress building up at the plate boundaries, and when the stress becomes too much for the rocks to handle, they break, releasing a sudden burst of energy in the form of an earthquake. In the given scenario, region A experiences many earthquakes, indicating a high level of stress building up at the plate boundaries within this region. This is typical for areas located along active plate boundaries where extensive tectonic activity results in regular earthquakes. On the other hand, region B does not experience any earthquakes, which suggests that the stresses within the plates in this region do not build up to the point of causing earthquakes. This could be due to several factors, such as the presence of weak or inactive plate boundaries that do not generate significant stress or a more stable geological setting with slower tectonic movements that prevent stress from accumulating beyond the rocks' breaking point. It is essential to note that, while region B does not experience earthquakes in the given situation, this does not necessarily mean that the region's plates never experience any stress. Instead, it suggests that the stress levels within the plates in region B may not exceed the breaking point of the rocks, or that any stress buildup dissipates more slowly and more consistently over time, preventing the occurrence of earthquakes. In conclusion, based on the information provided, region B is the area where stresses would not build in the plates or would build at a much slower and less dangerous rate compared to region A. It is important to remember, however, that Earth's geology is complex and continuously changing, and this is a simplified analysis of the situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The tests are designed to identify sleep apnoea, a condition that causes people to stop breathing during sleep. One patient told the BBC the problem was so acute it had driven her to contemplate suicide. \\"At one stage, my life was so awful because of how little sleep I was getting that I wanted to kill myself,\\" Carole Bennett, from Leeds, said. \\"When I got tested for sleep apnoea the doctors found that whilst I was asleep, I'd stop breathing 27 times in just one hour.\\" Josie Beatson, from Sheffield, said that before receiving treatment for her sleep apnoea, the condition had a terrible impact on her life. She said: \\"It's embarrassing to be at work and have your colleagues wake you up because they can hear you snoring. \\"The condition turned me into a recluse. I was so exhausted all the time that I didn't want to socialise, and because of my loud snoring I was too embarrassed to go and sleep at anyone else's house.\\" Sleep apnoea is the most common sleep disorder, according to the NHS. It is caused when the muscles and soft tissue in the throat relax, causing a blockage of the airways. The lack of oxygen to the brain causes those with the condition to wake up or have regular interruptions to their sleep. Common symptoms include loud snoring or gasping and grunting whilst asleep. Those with the condition usually manage it by wearing an oxygen mask at night, or other oral devices that keep the airways open. Many are encouraged to lose weight and in some cases people can undergo surgery to remove excess tissue in their passageways. Analysing data collected by NHS England, the BBC has found the number of sleeping disorder tests has increased every year over the past decade. NHS South Sefton in Liverpool had the highest rate of sleep diagnostic tests being commissioned last year. Doctors attribute the rise in the number of sleep tests to a greater sense of public awareness about the wider health implications of not getting enough sleep. \\"Sleep apnoea is a serious condition which can lead to other problems such as high blood pressure, which in turn can lead to strokes and heart attacks,\\" said Dr Stephen Bianchi from Sheffield's Northern General Hospital. It is estimated that about 1.5 million people in the UK suffer from the condition, although doctors warn many people will have never been formally diagnosed. \\"We think about 2% of females, and 4% of males in the UK have significant sleep apnoea. However, we suspect that 80% of those with the condition are unaware they have it,\\" Dr Bianchi added. Consultants at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust have been pioneering new ways of treating a range of sleep disorders. Patients with sleep apnoea  are often tested for neurological sleep conditions such as insomnias and rapid eye movement (REM) disorders. Iain Gordon, from Doncaster, has an REM behaviour disorder, which sees him physically act out his dreams when he's asleep. \\"If I have a dream that I'm fighting crocodiles or jumping off a cliff, I will shout and kick out. \\"But the reason why I've now sought help is because there have been instances recently where I've hit my wife whilst I've been asleep.\\" Dr Gary Dennis, from the Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield, said sleep disorders could have \\"wide and unpredictable\\" outcomes. One sleep disorder sufferer, Brian Thomas from Neath in south Wales, killed his wife during a violent nightmare and was told by a judge he \\"bore no responsibility\\". \\"REM disorders are not inconsequential,\\" said Dr Dennis. \\"At one end of the spectrum I've had the spouses of my patients who have needed dental work because they've been hit by their bed partner. But then at the other end I've had patients who have managed to drive themselves to the petrol station while they've been asleep.\\" Clinicians like Dr Dennis believe people need to pay more attention to their own \\"sleep hygiene\\" including diet, lifestyle and cutting down on late-night phone and tablet use. \\"These devices emit blue light and there is a clear association between using these devices late at night and then having poor amounts of sleep,\\" he said. \\"Put simply lots of people think sleep gets in the way of life, but I see it the other way round.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Ukip suspends general secretary over ‘candidate selection allegations’ The UK Independence party has suspended its general secretary in relation to alleged “impropriety” over candidate selection, even though he was selected to run for the party in a London consitutency less than two weeks ago. Roger Bird, who has been a senior Ukip official since July, said told the Guardian he could not discuss an “ongoing process” but there were no criminal allegations involved. In a statement, Ukip said: “Shortly after a claim came to light about the conduct of Mr Bird with regard to candidate selection, the UK Independence party took action swiftly and decisively, including steps involving external human resources consultants, as well as following due process and the party’s constitution to the letter. “Unfortunately, Ukip has had to suspend Mr Bird pending a full investigation into allegations made against him. The party has acted swiftly and decisively and will not tolerate impropriety of any kind amongst its staff.” In the absence of explanation, it is unclear whether the allegations related to his time as party secretary, his previous role as chairman of Ukip presiding over selections in the south-east of England, or his recent selection as a candidate for the seat of Cities of London and Westminster. It was initially thought Bird was the general election candidate in Mole Valley in Surrey, but the local branch chairman confirmed to the Guardian that he had resigned from that position last year and was selected for the London seat currently held by Tory MP Mark Field in late November. The party has recently been under scrutiny over the way some local candidates have been deselected potentially to make way for bigger names.

Cowboy builder Danny Shea, pictured, conned home-owners out of more than £2million by failing to complete work on their properties, including leaving one a roofless shell. A cowboy builder conned home-owners out of more than £2million by failing to complete work on their properties, including leaving one a roofless shell. Danny Shea removed the roof of one bungalow and left it an uninhabitable shell, but never completed the work, leaving the couple living in a caravan in the garden. Now the 48-year-old is behind bars after he was handed a five and a half year jail term for his crimes. Shea, of Bordon, Hampshire, was sentenced at Winchester Crown Court after pleading guilty to nine fraud charges and one of fraudulent trading. The offences involved homes in the Thursley, Chiddingfold, Tadworth and Chertsey areas of Surrey and Farnborough, Bordon and Grayshott in Hampshire, between 2007 and 2010. The South East Regional Organised Crime Unit (Serocu), which investigated Shea, found that the 48-year-old had carried out renovations and rebuilding worth £2.1 million which was not completed. Victims Martin Wells and his wife lost about £150,000 in payments to Shea, whom they employed to renovate their bungalow in Grayshott. Mr Wells said Shea ripped off the roof of his property but never returned to finish the job leaving him and his wife to live in a caravan through two winters,' Mr Wells told the BBC. 'As the weeks went by, there was not much work being done, no materials were arriving on site. 'I would be on the phone to Shea every day, sometimes several times a day. \\"When is the timber arriving? When are the bricks arriving?\\" He would always have a very plausible excuse. 'We were stuck in the caravan with a house with no roof on it. 'We were stupid to the extent that we gave him money. We probably lost £150,000 but we got to a stage where we had to believe this was going to happen.' Detective Sergeant Ian Ball said: 'For three years Shea systematically defrauded customers who engaged him to carry out building work. 'He claimed to be going to carry out work to a proper standard and finish the respective jobs. ' 'In fact he had no intention of doing either. After an original down-payment, he would obtain further money, again with no intention of doing the work properly or sometimes at all. The bungalow owned by Martin Wells in Grayshott, Hampshire, before work was started on the roof by cowboy builder Danny Shea. And this was the state of the Wells' bungalow after Danny Shea had failed to finish the job having removed the roof. The couple were forced to live in a caravan in the garden through two winters and lost tens of thousands of pounds. 'He would provide an initial quote, followed by a request for money upfront for labour and materials. 'He would provide references from customers satisfied with early work on their projects and suggested extra work which could be carried out. 'Further requests for payment would be made but work would slow and stop. There would be re-negotiation but by then the victims were sucked in and just wanted to have the work finished so would agree to the new demands and even pay suppliers direct for materials. 'Shea would meanwhile make token efforts at work just to keep them on the hook. Then he would disappear, leaving unfinished and sub-standard work. 'The cost of remedial work sometimes ran into hundreds of thousands of pounds. 'However, working with partners in many agencies and with the CPS, we were able to support the victims and get the evidence that finally enabled us to bring Shea to justice after an investigation that has now spanned three years.' The fraudulent trading related to theft of plant and construction machinery and motor vehicles, which had been unlawfully sold. Equipment worth more than £121,000 is still unaccounted for.

I hated the first episode of this show ( 'Protesting Hippies' ) so much in 1999 that I shunned the rest. However, when it came on 'The Paramount Comedy Channel' I watched it in full and, to my surprise, found it absolutely hilarious ( Motto: never judge a comedy series in its first week )!  Set in 1969, 'Hippies' stars Simon Pegg as 'Ray Purbbs', editor of an 'Oz'-like underground magazine called 'Mouth'. His friends are the feminist Jill, laid-back Alex, and the half-wit Hugo. Back in the late '60's, there was a feeling of incredible optimism amongst the young, that they could change the world through the printing of magazines nobody read. Rather than sneering at the hippies' naivety, 'Hippies' is affectionate towards it. Arthur Mathews' scripts cheekily parody a number of that era's icons - 'Hair', 'Woodstock', 'The Graduate', even the infamous 'Oz' obscenity trial of the early '70's. Excellent performances from the cast; Julian Rhind-Tutt's 'Alex' strangely put me in mind of the Richard O'Sullivan character from 'Man About The House'. Its a shame that there was never a second series, possibly because of people like me. If you missed 'Hippies', give it a try. Once you get past the dire opener, you're in for a treat!

Question: Who sends a heist notice ? Movie plot title: Case Closed: The Last Wizard of the Century Movie plot: The Phantom Thief Kid sends a heist notice, warning of another heist. The police deduce that his next target is a recently discovered FabergÃ© egg, which Suzuki Modern Art Museum in Osaka will display on August 22. The night of the heist, Kid steals the egg and flies off, and Conan and Heiji give chase. However, in the middle of the chase, an unknown assailant shoots Kid in the right eye, and Kid apparently falls into the sea to his death. After recovering the egg, the police fruitlessly search for Kid's body. The next day, Conan, Ran, and Kogoro board a boat to Tokyo. They meet Natsumi Kousaka, whose great-grandfather worked in FabergÃ©'s factory. She shows them a part of a sketch of two eggs and a key, which were found among her late grandmother's momentos. Conan suspects that the person who shot Kid is on the ship. That night, Ryu Sagawa, a freelance photographer covering the press with news of the egg, is murdered, shot in the right eye in the same fashion as Kid. Soon after his body is discovered, Inspector Megure with officers Takagi and Shiratori arrives by helicopter to inspect the crime scene. At first, they suspect Serena's father's servant, Mr. Nishino, but the police and Conan conclude the culprit is Scorpion - a mysterious killer who always shoots his victims in the right eye. A missing lifeboat hints that Scorpion has escaped, and the boat's passengers go to Yokosuka Castle, which holds Scorpion's next target: the second egg. While exploring the castle, the group stumbles across secret passages beneath the castle. As they traverse the tunnels, Inui, an art dealer, pursues a shadowy figure he sees in one of the tunnels, and is shot by a silenced handgun. Delving farther into the tunnel, they find a coffin with a corpse clutching the second egg. Suddenly, the two eggs are snatched away. Conan deduces that Scorpion is Seiran the historian. She shoots her victims in the right eye to avenge her ancestor, Rasputin, whose body was found with an eye missing. Seiran attempts to kill Conan with her last... A:","output":"The Phantom Thief Kid sends the heist notice as indicated in the movie plot summary for \\"Case Closed: The Last Wizard of the Century\\". This notice sets the initial events of the movie in motion as it informs the police and others involved in the storyline that the Phantom Thief Kid is planning to embark upon another heist. We infer from the summary that this is not the first time that the Phantom Thief Kid has issued such a notice, hence it seems to be a part of his modus operandi to inform his targets beforehand.  In response to this notice, the police theorize that the Thief's upcoming target is going to be a recently identified Fabergé egg that is set to be exhibited at the Suzuki Modern Art Museum in Osaka. This sets up the anticipation and excitement for the upcoming events and provides an opportunity for the protagonist, Conan, to proactively seek out and try to prevent the Phantom Thief Kid's planned robbery. On the night of the suggested heist, the Phantom Thief Kid accomplishes his mission by successfully stealing the egg and taking off, prompting Conan and Heiji to follow him. However, their pursuit leads to an unexpected twist when an unknown attacker shoots the Phantom Thief Kid in his right eye, causing him to seemingly fall into the sea, presumably dead. Therefore, the heist notice in the context of the movie plot \\"Case Closed: The Last Wizard of the Century\\" stands as a significant element that establishes the plot progression. It not only introduces the modus operandi of the Phantom Thief Kid, but allows the police and Conan to be aware and in anticipation of his next move. This plays into the dynamics of the interactions between the characters, building suspense and setting the pace for the events that are about to unravel. The heist notice ultimately serves as a catalyst driving the varied events of the movie plot."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

He stated that he was born in Rolling Fork, Mississippi, in 1915, but it is believed to be more likely that he was born in Jug's Corner, in neighboring Issaquena County, in 1913. Recent research has uncovered documentation showing that in the 1930s and 1940s, before his rise to fame, the year of his birth was reported as 1913 on his marriage license, recording notes, and musicians' union card. A 1955 interview in the Chicago Defender is the earliest in which he stated 1915 as the year of his birth, and he continued to say this in interviews from that point onward. Initially, the Chess brothers would not allow Muddy Waters to use his working band in the recording studio; instead, he was provided with a backing bass by Ernest \\"Big\\" Crawford or by musicians assembled specifically for the recording session, including \\"Baby Face\\" Leroy Foster and Johnny Jones. Gradually, Chess relented, and by September 1953 he was recording with one of the most acclaimed blues groups in history: Little Walter Jacobs on harmonica, Jimmy Rogers on guitar, Elga Edmonds (also known as Elgin Evans) on drums, and Otis Spann on piano. The band recorded a series of blues classics during the early 1950s, some with the help of the bassist and songwriter Willie Dixon, including \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\", \\"I Just Want to Make Love to You\\", and \\"I'm Ready\\".  Along with his former harmonica player Little Walter Jacobs and recent southern transplant Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters reigned over the early 1950s Chicago blues scene, his band becoming a proving ground for some of the city's best blues talent. Little Walter continued a collaborative relationship long after he left Muddy Waters's band in 1952, appearing on most of the band's classic recordings in the 1950s. Muddy Waters developed a long-running, generally good-natured rivalry with Wolf. The success of his ensemble paved the way for others in his group to make their own solo careers. In 1952, Little Walter left when his single \\"Juke\\" became a hit, and in 1955, Rogers quit to work exclusively with his own band, which had been a sideline until that time.  During the mid-1950s, Muddy Waters' singles were frequently on Billboard magazine's various Rhythm & Blues charts including \\"Sugar Sweet\\" in 1955 and \\"Trouble No More\\", \\"Forty Days and Forty Nights\\", and \\"Don't Go No Farther\\" in 1956. 1956 also saw the release of one of his best-known numbers, \\"Got My Mojo Working\\", although it did not appear on the charts. However, by the late 1950s, his singles success had come to an end, with only \\"Close to You\\" reaching the chart in 1958. Also in 1958, Chess released Muddy Waters' first album, The Best of Muddy Waters, which collected twelve of his singles up to 1956. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Who was with Muddy Waters in the blues group ?","output":"In Muddy Waters' blues group, he was accompanied by Little Walter Jacobs on harmonica, Jimmy Rogers on guitar, Elga Edmonds (also known as Elgin Evans) on drums, and Otis Spann on piano.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Spiders are not insects as many people believe. They belong to a class of animals called arachnids . Spiders have eight eyes, four pairs of legs, and can grow a new leg if they lose one. A spider's body is divided into two sections: the abdomen  and the thorax .The legs, eyes, and mouthparts are in the thorax section. Most spiders have poison glands and sharp teeth. They use their sharp teeth to force poison into the insects they catch for food. This poison can make an insect lose the ability to move, and the helpless insect is then _ by the spider. Spiders usually have silk glands under their abdomen. They produce a liquid that is thicker than water from their glands. When the liquid comes into the air, it dries into silk. Many spiders use this silk to form webs to catch insects and to make cocoons that protect their eggs. This amazing silk is also used to create lines that spiders hang onto as they travel to new areas. Spiders live in almost everywhere on earth. The only places where there are no spiders are the coldest places, the highest mountains and the seas. Question: According to the passage, which of the following is WRONG?

Given the below context:  Neill was promoted to lieutenant colonel during his participation in the Siege of Béxar, and 10 days later Houston placed him in charge of the Texian garrison in the city. In January residents had begun evacuating ahead of Santa Anna's approaching forces. Neill pleaded with Houston for replenishment of troops, supplies and weaponry. The departure of Texians who joined the Matamoros Expedition had left Neill with only about 100 men. At that point Houston viewed Béxar as a military liability and did not want Santa Anna's advancing army gaining control of any remaining soldiers or artillery. He dispatched Bowie with instructions to remove the artillery, have the defenders abandon the Alamo mission and destroy it. Upon his January 19 arrival and subsequent discussions with Neill, Bowie decided the mission was the right place to stop the Mexican army in its tracks.  He stayed and began to help Neill prepare for the coming attack.  Lieutenant Colonel William B. Travis arrived with reinforcements on February 3. When Neill was given leave to attend to family matters on February 11, Travis assumed command of the mission, and three days later he and Bowie agreed to a joint command. Santa Anna crossed the Rio Grande on February 16, and the Mexican army's assault on the Alamo began February 23. Captain Juan Seguín left the mission on February 25, carrying a letter from Travis to Fannin at Goliad requesting more reinforcements. Santa Anna extended an offer of amnesty to Tejanos inside the fortress; a non-combatant survivor, Enrique Esparza, said that most Tejanos left when Bowie advised them to take the offer. In response to Travis' February 24 letter To the People of Texas, 32 militia volunteers formed the Gonzales Ranging Company of Mounted Volunteers and arrived at the Alamo on February 29.

Summarize: In the wake of loss, you often forget your bigger goals in life. You may think losing your first love means you've failed on the goal to find a loving relationship in life. However, look at your larger goals in terms of relationships. One failed relationship does not mean you've failed on your goals.  Revisit what you want out of life. In addition to finding a loving partner, think of other goals. What kind of career or education do you want, for example? Remember that it's okay to take a break from relationships for a while. You don't have to focus on finding romance again right away. Give yourself time to heal and pursue other goals, then get back into dating when you're ready. One loss does not mean you have failed. In fact, the vast majority of people face a lot of loss and rejection on the path to larger goals. You do not need this one particular person to eventually reach your goals. Many people feel getting involved with someone else will help them forget their first love. While a new relationship can help distract you from thoughts of the current one, you're not likely to find relationship success this way. Instead of jumping into a new romance, take some time to reflect.  Think about what you want out of a relationship. Think about the ways your need were and were not met. This will help you figure out how to find a more suitable partner in the future. Many people jump from romance to romance, hoping to find the right person. However, if you're not okay on your own, you will not be able to have a functional romance. You need to grieve your first love and figure out what you want for the future. When you're recovering from a recent breakup, you will probably be very emotionally vulnerable for a while. The feelings that you may develop for other people during this time will not always be rational. Be cautious about pursuing these feelings, since you may be at risk of being hurt or taken advantage of by someone who recognizes your vulnerability. Look for a friend, family member, or c-worker who has also suffered heartbreak, but moved on successfully. Try to model your behavior off of someone who does not need a relationship to feel fulfilled and happy.  Find someone who does okay on their own. You want to lean on someone who does not need a relationship to feel fulfilled. Once you've found someone, think about how they cope with heartbreak. Look for the ways they stay independent and strong after a relationship ends. If you feel comfortable doing so, ask the person to be your mentor. Reach out to them for advice from time to time during your recovery process. However, take care not to become too needy or dependent on them. While you may want to move forward, it's important to acknowledge your feelings. Take steps to feel better, but accept sadness is a normal part of the process. Getting over a first love is hard, and even if you're doing everything right it will not happen over night. Do not beat yourself up for having bad days. This is normal and it will take time to move on.  Don't panic if a reminder of your ex leaves you feeling bad. If you try to hard to avoid the bad feeling, you may make it worse. Instead, accept that you're going to feel sad for a bit. Let yourself cry if necessary. Get the bad feelings out so you can continue to move forward. To help you gain perspective, think about times when you've felt sad in the past, and remember that you eventually felt better. Remind yourself that the sadness will diminish, and that you will begin to have more good days again as time passes.","output":"After experiencing loss, it's common to lose sight of bigger life goals.

I saw lots of surprised faces because people were told I was actually 19 years old. I'm actually 19 years old, which isn't much of a problem. I'm like the oldest of my friends and the shortest, which is pretty funny. That's probably one of the reasons I fit in so well with them. I volunteered at a weekend school teaching young children. Parents always looked me up and down like \\"why is this 13-year-old girl teaching my child?!??!?\\" I guessed it was because I'm also petite ,and I didn't know whether I had a childish face...??? Sometimes I found it funny, sometimes I found it annoying . But I just shrugged it off at last. You know, soon enough people got to know me and then realized I was not actually a 13-year-old girl. This short thing used to be a problem for me, though. I was very very small when I was younger, so kids would  _ me. When I was 12, 8-year-old girls would look down at me like \\"I CAN'TBELIEVEYOU'RETWELVE!\\" I had always wanted to be tall. But now that I'm older, I got used to it, and I actually love it.

Q:Greg is studying the environmental impact of agriculture. He noticed that in his own state a lake near agricultural lands has been declared as a dead zone. For his study Greg labeled this zone as zone A. Then he found near a national park in his state a lake is not declared as a dead zone. To further his study he labeled this zone as zone B.  Would zone A have less or more oxygen than zone B?  Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. A:","output":"Based on the given information, zone A, the dead zone near agricultural lands, would have less oxygen than zone B, the lake near a national park that has not been declared as a dead zone. The primary reason for this difference in oxygen levels can be attributed to the presence of higher amounts of nitrogen in zone A as a result of agricultural practices involving the use of fertilizers. In zone A, the runoff from agricultural fields carries dissolved fertilizers, which are rich in nitrogen, into the nearby lake. This influx of nutrients, particularly nitrogen, accelerates the growth of algae in the water, causing an algal bloom. As the dense population of algae photosynthesize, they consume carbon dioxide from the water, leading to a depletion of carbon dioxide. After the algae die off, decomposer organisms such as bacteria break down the dead algal tissue. During this decomposition process, the decomposers consume dissolved oxygen present in the water. Due to the large amount of dead algae, the decomposers' oxygen demand increases, leading to a rapid depletion of oxygen levels in the water. This creates a hypoxic or oxygen-deficient environment, which is not conducive for the survival of most aquatic organisms. Consequently, the affected area, in this case zone A, becomes a dead zone where there is too little oxygen for most living organisms to survive and thrive. On the other hand, zone B, which is the lake near the national park, is not prone to the same level of agricultural runoff and nitrogen enrichment. This means that the growth of algae in zone B is not accelerated to the same extent as in zone A, thus avoiding the chain of events that lead to the creation of a dead zone. As a result, zone B would have higher oxygen levels compared to zone A, allowing for a healthier aquatic ecosystem and a more conducive environment for various aquatic organisms to flourish."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How does a change in AC frequency affect an electrical system? What is the use of frequency in A electrical system?","output":"No, these questions do not have the same meaning. Although both questions revolve around the topic of frequency in an electrical system, they focus on different aspects and seek different information. Let's analyze and elaborate on both questions to give a clearer understanding of their meanings. 1. How does a change in AC frequency affect an electrical system? This question is concerned with the effects of varying frequency on an electrical system, particularly an alternating current (AC) system. It aims to explore the consequences of frequency changes on the performance and characteristics of an AC electrical system. As for the answer to this question, a change in AC frequency can affect an electrical system in various ways: a. Impact on electrical motors: AC motors, specifically induction motors, operate at a speed proportional to the frequency of the supplied voltage. Consequently, any change in the frequency will affect the motor's rotation speed, which might lead to inefficient operation or even damage the motor. b. Power output: The frequency of AC systems is directly related to the power output for synchronous and induction generators. Variations in frequency can cause fluctuations in the power output that may result in undesirable system instabilities. c. Load balancing: Power stations are often designed to work at specific frequencies. Therefore, any deviation from the standard frequency could affect load balancing; simultaneously, generation, transmission, and consumption of the electrical power might not be optimally matched. d. Resonance: The inductive and capacitive loads in the electrical system exhibit frequency-dependent behavior. Changes in frequency might cause resonance, resulting in large currents or voltages in the system, imposing a risk of equipment damage. e. Transformers: The operation of a transformer relies on the magnetic induction principle, which is affected by the rate of voltage change or frequency. A variation in frequency may cause excessive heating, decreased efficiency, and even failure of transformers. 2. What is the use of frequency in an electrical system? This question is focused on understanding the role or purpose of frequency in an electrical system. It seeks to explain the significance of frequency in maintaining and operating an electrical system. Frequency plays a crucial role in various aspects of an electrical system, as detailed below: a. AC generation: In generators, frequency is determined by the speed at which the rotor rotates within a magnetic field. For synchronous generators, the rotation speed is directly related to the frequency produced, resulting in an efficient generation of electrical energy that can be transferred across power systems. b. Power quality and stability: Maintaining a stable frequency is essential for ensuring a consistent power supply and quality. In electrical grids, the frequency must be strictly regulated to avoid instabilities and potential damages to infrastructure and end-user equipment. c. Timekeeping: The consistency and accuracy of AC frequency allow for timekeeping applications, such as using the 50 Hz or 60 Hz frequency as a reference for electric clocks or measuring devices. d. Signal transmission: In communication systems, frequency plays a vital role in signal transmission and separation, which enables multiple signals to be transmitted concurrently without interference. e. AC motor control: As mentioned earlier, the operation of AC motors is influenced by the supplied frequency. Frequency control is widely used in motor speed control for applications like adjustable-speed drives in HVAC systems, escalators, and conveyor belts. In conclusion, it is evident that the two questions are different. The first question aims to understand the impact of frequency changes on an electrical system, while the second question focuses on the importance and uses of frequency within electrical systems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context:  Steamtown, U.S.A., was a steam locomotive museum that ran steam excursions out of North Walpole, New Hampshire, and Bellows Falls, Vermont, from the 1960s to 1983. The museum was founded by millionaire seafood industrialist F. Nelson Blount.  The non-profit Steamtown Foundation took over operations following his death in 1967. Because of Vermont's air quality regulations restricting steam excursions, declining visitor attendance, and disputes over the use of track, some pieces of the collection were relocated to Scranton, Pennsylvania, in the mid-1980s and the rest were auctioned off. After the move, Steamtown continued to operate in Scranton but failed to attract the expected 200,000–400,000 visitors.  Within two years the tourist attraction was facing bankruptcy, and more pieces of the collection were sold to pay off debt. In 1986, the United States House of Representatives, under the urging of Pennsylvania Representative Joseph M. McDade, voted to approve 8 million to study the collection and to begin the process of making it a National Historic Site. As a result, the National Park Service (NPS) conducted historical research on the equipment that remained in the Foundation's possession. This research was used as a Scope of Collections Statement for the Steamtown National Historic Site.  The scope was published in 1991 under the title Steamtown Special History Study. The report provided concise histories of each piece of equipment and made recommendations as to whether or not each piece belonged in the soon-to-be government-funded collection. By 1995, Steamtown had been acquired and developed by the NPS with a 66 million allocation. Several more pieces have been removed from the collection as a result of the government acquisition.

Following are a few suggestions about how to create unanswerable questions: (i) create questions which require satisfying a constraint that is not mentioned in the passage (ii) create questions which require information beyond what is provided in the passage in order to answer (iii) replace an existing entity, number, date mentioned in the passage with other entity, number, date and use it in the question (iv) create a question which is answerable from the passage and then replace one or two words by their antonyms or insert/remove negation words to make it unanswerable. Problem:Passage: On the 1st of January 1901 the nation-state of Australia officially came into existence as a federation. The Australian continent was colonised by the United Kingdom in 1788, which subsequently established six, eventually self-governing, colonies there. In the 1890s the governments of these colonies all held referendums on becoming a unified, self-governing \\"Commonwealth\\" within the British Empire. When all the colonies voted in favour of federation, the Federation of Australia commenced, resulting in the establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901. The model of Australian federalism adheres closely to the original model of the United States of America, although it does so through a parliamentary Westminster system rather than a presidential system. Solution:","output":"Question: What was the initial response of the French colonies in Australia to the proposal of forming a unified \\"Commonwealth\\" within the British Empire during the 1880s? Justification: This question is unanswerable because the passage primarily focuses on the British colonization and establishment of Australia. It mentions the six self-governing colonies established by the United Kingdom and their referendums in the 1890s, but it does not provide any information about French colonies or any involvement in the formation of the Commonwealth of Australia. Additionally, the question has replaced the 1890s with the 1880s, which is not mentioned in the passage as part of the referendums process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Natalia Martinez, an Argentine climber rescued off Yukon's Mount Logan Thursday night, did \\"everything right\\" in preparing for her ill-fated expedition, says the Parks Canada official who led the rescue mission.      Martinez had been stranded about 3,700 metres up Canada's highest peak since Monday, after a pair of earthquakes hit the area, making the terrain too dangerous for her to leave her camp.      After a lucky break in the weather on Thursday, the rescue team sprang into action, knowing they likely had a small window to work in. A Trans North Helicopters pilot was able to rescue the 37-year-old at about 9:15 p.m. PT.      Camilo Rada, Martinez's partner, said he can't wait to hold her in his arms.

Natalia Martínez, who began a solo traverse of 5,959-metre Mount Logan in the Yukon late last month, was at an elevation of about 3,900 metres when a 6.2-magnitude earthquake hit Yukon and Alaska on Monday, sending snow and glacial ice crashing down around her camp. A few hours later, the mountain was rattled by a second earthquake of magnitude 6.3 along with several aftershocks.            Martínez – ensconced in her tent about 135 miles from the earthquakes’ epicentre – was unscathed by the avalanches triggered by the quakes, but left stranded.      A message posted on the ExpeNews website popular with climbers said Martínez was rescued on Thursday night.      ExpeNews said a pilot with the charter service Icefield Discovery had noticed an improvement in weather conditions and alerted a rescue team. The website said Martínez was taken to the Icefield Discovery base in Kluane Lake.      Facebook Twitter Pinterest Martínez on the summit of Mount Malaspina on the Saint Elias Mountains of Yukon. Photograph: Courtesy of Camilo A Rada Giacaman      Camilo Rada, Martínez’s climbing partner of 10 years, said this week that Martínez had been working hard to keep her camp safe and to stay safe.      He described Martínez as a highly accomplished climber whose experiences in Patagonia had readied her for heavy winds and extreme cold. “She’s used to really serious weather in Patagonia, she had been through a number of storms and she knows what to do. But that doesn’t mean it’s easy – it’s very tiring, especially if you have to do it alone,” he said.      Rada, who was in regular contact with Martínez via satellite phone from his home in British Columbia, said the 37-year-old was in her tent on Monday morning when she heard what she described as a tremendous roar. “She didn’t know it was an earthquake. She thought the glacier she was on was collapsing,” said Rada. “The whole ground around her was shaking and moved a lot. She was pretty scared.”      Associated Press contributed to this report       ||||| ADVERTISEMENT      WHITEHORSE — A climber who was stranded on Canada's highest mountain following an earthquake in Yukon has reportedly been rescued.      Natalia Martinez, 37, of Argentina, began a solo climb on Mount Logan in Kluane National Park and Reserve on April 22. Two large earthquakes on Monday caused avalanches near her camp.      A message posted by ExpeNews on its website — which is used by climbers, trekkers and outdoor enthusiasts to track their progress and location — said Martinez was successfully rescued in a three-hour operation that ended at about 10:30 p.m. local time.

The website said Martinez was taken to the Icefield Discovery base in Kluane Lake in southwest Yukon.      Solo attempts to climb the mountain are rare      Parks Canada spokeswoman Christine Aikens said earlier that officials were in close contact with Martinez — an experienced climber who reported that she still had a good supply of food and fuel.      Aikens said avalanches caused by the quakes had caused glacial ice to fall in the area of the climber's camp, which is at 3,900-metre level on the east ridge of Mount Logan.

The software maker claims that Google used its dominant position in the search market to restrict the growth of Microsoft services. It cites a number of practices, including Google limiting the ability of Microsoft Bing to index web content. Google said it was not surprised by the move and it would happily discuss its business with the European Commission. In a detailed blog, Microsoft's general counsel, Brad Smith, outlined the company's grievances. He wrote: \\"Our filing today focuses on a pattern of actions that Google has taken to entrench its dominance in the markets for online search and search advertising to the detriment of European consumers.\\" The post goes on to list five different ways in which Google, according to Microsoft, has sought to control the search market. Those are: The European Commission launched an investigation into allegations of anti-competitive practices by Google last November, at the behest of several internet companies, including Ciao, a shopping site owned by Microsoft. It is likely, if the Commission accepts the latest round of complaints from Microsoft, that they would be rolled into the same investigation. For the Microsoft case to be accepted, the company would have to prove two things - firstly that Google was dominant in a particular market, namely search, and secondly that it had abused that position. In a statement, Google said it would cooperate with any investigation. \\"We're not surprised that Microsoft has done this, since one of their subsidiaries was one of the original complainants. For our part, we continue to discuss the case with the European Commission and we're happy to explain to anyone how our business works,\\" is stated. Penalties for companies found to have engaged in anti-competitive practices in Europe can be severe.  The EC has the power to impose fines up to 10% of global earnings. That will likely have a bearing on how the case proceeds, according to Mark Tricker, an antitrust lawyer with the law firm Norton Rose. He told BBC News: \\"Once the Commission has formulated its claims then I suspect that Google will enter into a dialogue with them to address those concerns so it does not have to reach a judgement.\\" Microsoft's position as accuser in an anti-competition case is something of a role reversal. In the past, the world's leading software company has been the target of similar actions. A 2003 EC ruling determined that Microsoft had unfairly advantaged its Windows Media Player software over other streaming technologies by embedding it into the Windows operating system. It was fined Â£381m, followed by a further Â£194m in 2006 for failing to comply with elements of the original ruling. To date, the largest fine levied by the EC was Â£948m against Intel in 2009.

McCready described the recording environment as \\"a pretty positive one\\" and \\"very intense and spiritual.\\" Regarding the time period when the lyrics were being written, Vedder said, \\"There's been a lot of mortality...It's a weird time to be writing. Roskilde changed the shape of us as people, and our filter for seeing the world changed.\\" Pearl Jam released its seventh album, Riot Act, on November 12, 2002. It included the singles \\"I Am Mine\\" and \\"Save You\\". The album featured a much more folk-based and experimental sound, evident in the presence of B3 organist Boom Gaspar on songs such as \\"Love Boat Captain\\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said \\"Riot Act is the album that Pearl Jam has been wanting to make since Vitalogy—a muscular art rock record, one that still hits hard but that is filled with ragged edges and odd detours.\\" The track entitled \\"Arc\\" was recorded as a vocal tribute to the nine people who died at the Roskilde Festival in June 2000. Vedder only performed this song nine times on the 2003 tour, and the band left the track off all released bootlegs.In 2003, the band embarked on its Riot Act Tour, which included tours in Australia and North America. The band continued its official bootleg program, making every concert from the tour available in CD form through its official website.

Lynyrd Skynyrd ( LEN-@rd-SKIN-@rd) is an American rock band best known for having popularized the Southern rock genre during the 1970s. Originally formed in 1964 as My Backyard in Jacksonville, Florida, the band was also known by names such as The Noble Five and One Percent, before finally deciding on \\"Lynyrd Skynyrd\\" in 1969. The band gained worldwide recognition for its live performances and signature songs \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\" and \\"Free Bird\\". At the peak of their success, band members Ronnie Van Zant and Steve Gaines, and backup singer Cassie Gaines, died in an airplane crash in 1977, putting an abrupt end to the 1970s era of the band. In the summer of 1964, teenage friends Ronnie Van Zant, Bob Burns, Allen Collins, Gary Rossington, and Larry Junstrom formed the earliest incarnation of the band in Jacksonville, Florida as My Backyard. The band then changed its name to The Noble Five. The band used different names before using One Percent during 1968.  In 1969, Van Zant sought a new name. The group settled on Leonard Skinnerd, a mocking tribute to physical education teacher Leonard Skinner at Robert E. Lee High School. Skinner was notorious for strictly enforcing the school's policy against boys having long hair. Rossington dropped out of school, tired of being hassled about his hair. The more distinctive spelling \\"Lynyrd Skynyrd\\" was being used at least as early as 1970. Despite their high school acrimony, the band developed a friendlier relationship with Skinner in later years, and invited him to introduce them at a concert in the Jacksonville Memorial Coliseum. Skinner also allowed the band to use a photo of his Leonard Skinner Realty sign for the inside of their third album.  By 1970, Lynyrd Skynyrd had become a top band in Jacksonville, headlining at some local concerts, and opening for several national acts. Pat Armstrong, a Jacksonville native and partner in Macon, Georgia-based Hustlers Inc. with Phil Walden's younger brother, Alan Walden, became the band's managers. Armstrong left Hustlers shortly thereafter to start his own agency. Walden stayed with the band until 1974, when management was turned over to Peter Rudge. The band continued to perform throughout the South in the early 1970s, further developing their hard-driving blues rock sound and image, and experimenting with recording their sound in a studio. Skynyrd crafted this distinctively \\"southern\\" sound through a creative blend of blues, and a slight British rock influence.  During this time, the band experienced some lineup changes for the first time. Junstrom left and was briefly replaced by Greg T. Walker on bass. At that time, Ricky Medlocke joined as a second drummer and occasional second vocalist to help fortify Burns' sound on the drums. Medlocke grew up with the founding members of Lynyrd Skynyrd and his grandfather Shorty Medlocke was an influence in the writing of \\"The Ballad of Curtis Loew\\". Some versions of the band's history state Burns briefly left the band during this time, although other versions state that Burns played with the band continuously through 1974.  The band played some shows with both Burns and Medlocke, using a dual-drummer approach. In 1971, they made some recordings at the famous Muscle Shoals Sound Studio with Walker and Medlocke serving as the rhythm section, but without the participation of Burns. Medlocke and Walker left the band to play with another southern rock band, Blackfoot. When the Lynyrd Skynyrd made a second round of Muscle Shoals recordings in 1972, Burns was once again featured on drums along with new bassist, Leon Wilkeson. Medlocke and Walker did not appear on any album until the 1978 release of First and... Last, which compiled the early Muscle Shoals sessions. Also in 1972, roadie Billy Powell became the keyboardist for the band. Entity:","output":"Lynyrd Skynyrd"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. The U.S. Department of Justice filed an unprecedented lawsuit Thursday against the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office for refusing to provide full access to records and facilities for a civil-rights investigation.      The federal lawsuit      Arpaio, Pearce respond      The suit alleges the Sheriff's Office is in violation of federal civil-rights laws by refusing for 17 months to fully cooperate with an investigation into police practices and jail operations. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Phoenix, names Sheriff Joe Arpaio, his office and Maricopa County.      The Justice Department wants extensive records related to booking procedures, language and interpretation services, arrests, and access to staff and jails.      County officials said Arpaio is jeopardizing future federal funding, which requires government agencies to comply with civil-rights laws. Six percent of the county's 2 billion budget comes from federal funding, and a loss would be \\"catastrophic,\\" county officials said.      The federal investigation dates to 2008 and seeks to determine whether the Sheriff's Office discriminates on the basis of national origin. Arpaio denies any discrimination and said he was surprised by the lawsuit. He has 21 days to respond.      The civil-rights probe is unrelated to a separate abuse-of-power criminal investigation against the Sheriff's Office by the Justice Department, which is connected to long-running disputes with county government and the judiciary and has led to months of grand-jury testimony.      Attorneys for the Sheriff's Office repeatedly have said they were cooperating with the civil-rights probe but set conditions on the breadth of documents they would release and when. Last week, a sheriff's attorney said in a letter to the Justice Department that he had not agreed to their deadlines.      On Thursday, federal officials made good on their threat to sue. Justice Department officials could not point to a case within the past 30 years in which they had to sue a law-enforcement department to provide access to information.      Dennis Burke, U.S. attorney for Arizona, said that Arpaio's behavior is \\"self-serving\\" and pointed out that the Sheriff's Office is legally obligated to provide access to records and facilities because the office receives federal money.      \\"This is about accountability, and the Sheriff Office's lack of it,\\" Burke told The Republic. \\"They're trying to design their own self-serving, contorted rules, and they expect unprecedented special treatment different than any other law-enforcement agency across the country - or in history. They want to voluntarily comply with what they want to comply with - despite repeated requests over 17 months.\\"      Attorney Robert Driscoll, who has been negotiating with the Justice Department on Arpaio's behalf, denounced the lawsuit as an attempt to undermine Arpaio's immigration enforcement.      Arpaio released a statement saying President Barack Obama's administration \\"intended to sue us all along, no matter what we did to try to avert it.\\"      But, according to the lawsuit, officials in the Justice Department's civil-rights unit first started looking at allegations of civil-rights violations by the Sheriff's Office in June 2008, during the George W. Bush era. The probe was not revealed publicly until March 2009.      Arpaio, however, contends the inquiry is part of a conspiracy connecting the White House, Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon and local advocacy groups.      The discussions      The complaint details the back-and-forth discussions between the Sheriff's Office and the Justice Department, culminating in Driscoll's letter last week. In that letter, he agreed to cooperate but not to the extent requested by the investigators.      Driscoll had met with Justice Department officials just days earlier. In a memo of that meeting, a chief in the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division detailed the records that must be produced and asked to tour six jails and interview staff about a range of issues, including intake and booking procedures, and language and interpretation services. Investigators also requested documents related to arrests dating to January 2008.      The attorney asked the Justice Department to be more specific about what it wanted and indicated he would not make a Sept. 10 deadline.      Burke said Driscoll's response triggered the lawsuit. \\"The letter contradicts what they said in the meeting,\\" he said.      According to legal experts, the lawsuit seeking records will be difficult for Arpaio to win.      Paul Bender, an Arizona State University law professor and former deputy solicitor for the Justice Department, said such disputes \\"are usually resolved in favor of the person looking for the documents. You're entitled to get anything that might be relevant.\\"      But Bender said civil-rights offenses are difficult to prove. \\"You have to show intent,\\" he said, and that is why investigators want to look at a wide range of documents and policies. \\"This investigation goes to the heart of people's complaints against Sheriff Joe, that he discriminates in his traffic stops and jail practices.\\"      Jose de Jesus Rivera, a former U.S. attorney for Arizona, agreed. \\"It's pretty clear cut that they're entitled to those records,\\" he said. \\"It's not like they're rushing to judgment. They've given them a year and a half to comply.\\"      Paul Charlton, another former U.S. Attorney for Arizona, agreed: \\"When people are fighting you for documents you have a right to, there's reason to believe those documents show evidence of consciousness of guilt. There's no other reason not to turn them over.\\"      Reaction was swift from some Hispanic leaders, including County Supervisor Mary Rose Wilcox, who called on Arpaio to cooperate fully with the Justice Department.      \\"This is ridiculous and irresponsible, so give over your documents, give them access to your facilities, and give interviews with your staff and comply,\\" Wilcox said.      An attorney for the county Board of Supervisors proposed Thursday afternoon in a letter to the Justice Department that the Sheriff's Office and the federal government resolve the matter through mediation. The attorney, Tom Irvine, asked the Justice Department to enter mediation next week, before the dispute goes to court.      Arpaio's refusal      Arpaio first refused to cooperate with federal officials back in July 2009, three months after the probe became public.      His reasoning alternated from an allegation that the Justice Department was not clearly articulating the scope of the investigation, to Arpaio's belief that federal investigators violated their own policy when they tried to gain access to documents that sheriff's officials already had turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents as part of an annual audit.      Arpaio and Driscoll also claim Justice officials already have access to thousands of documents they obtained over the course of two other ongoing civil lawsuits involving racial profiling.      But Burke and other legal experts point out that Arpaio does not get to direct the investigation and decide which documents are relevant.      The two sides stopped communicating for months, although Justice representatives promised the inquiry would go on and investigators continued to visit the Valley to speak with potential victims and witnesses.      Arpaio began to change his stance on cooperating last month, after the Justice Department first threatened to sue to force the Sheriff's Office to turn over the records.      The next day, Arpaio's attorney said the Sheriff's Office was cooperating with certain aspects of the investigation focusing on jails. But Driscoll continued to insist they had no obligation to cooperate with the federal investigation into the sheriff's street-level enforcement practices.      Arpaio said he was caught off-guard by Thursday's filing: \\"They have hundreds and thousands of reports,\\" he said. \\"Why did this happen now?\\"      The Sheriff's Office has agreed to turn over 500,000 e-mails and 100,000 documents related to immigration enforcement, a spokeswoman said.      Funding is at stake      The consequences for failing to cooperate with the probe could be financially harmful, officials and attorneys said.      At stake is 113 million in future federal funding for the county, they say, which is given on the condition that officials agree they will not discriminate against residents and will cooperate with federal officials. The money funds dozens of programs, such as nutrition for women and children, energy assistance for low-income families, housing, and health care for the homeless.      Supervisors attorney Irvine said it is unclear if federal officials could rescind money they have already awarded to the county.      But future funding could be at risk because county officials regularly have to certify they are complying with federal laws. Because the Board of Supervisors is uncertain if those laws are being followed, they cannot sign for certification that allows them to apply for the funds.      \\"Worst case is that if the federal opinion is that Maricopa County is out of compliance with Title VI (of the Civil Rights Act of 1964), and if that were to last a year, that would eliminate all 113 million,\\" Irvine said. \\"We have no certainty that environmental, highway, health, federal monies will not be severely impacted. Hopefully, that doesn't happen.\\"      County officials also hope Arpaio will agree to work with the Justice Department to avoid legal fees. The county already has paid out more than 3.2 million in taxpayer dollars to pay for attorneys, audits and expenses related to the ongoing disputes that have embroiled county government.      Several of those battles were waged over access to sheriff's records. For example, sheriff's officials are fighting with the supervisors over access to financial and personnel records, which has cost upward of 100,000 in public funds. ||||| The U.S. Justice Department sued Sheriff Joe Arpaio on Thursday, saying the Arizona lawman refused for more than a year to turn over records in an investigation into allegations his department discriminates against Hispanics.      The lawsuit calls Arpaio and his office's defiance \\"unprecedented,\\" and said the federal government has been trying since March 2009 to get officials to comply with its probe of alleged discrimination, unconstitutional searches and seizures, and having English-only policies in his jails that discriminates against people with limited English skills.      Arpaio had been given until Aug. 17 to hand over documents it first asked for 15 months ago.      Arpaio's attorney, Robert Driscoll, declined immediate comment on the lawsuit, saying he had just received it and hadn't yet conferred with his client.      Arpaio's office had said it has fully cooperated in the jail inquiry but won't hand over additional documents into the examination of the alleged unconstitutional searches because federal authorities haven't said exactly what they were investigating.      It's the latest action against Arizona by the federal government, which earlier sued the state to stop its strict new immigration law that requires police officers to question people about their immigration status.      \\"The actions of the sheriff's office are unprecedented,\\" said Thomas Perez, assistant attorney general for the department's civil rights division. \\"It is unfortunate that the department was forced to resort to litigation to gain access to public documents and facilities.\\"      The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Phoenix and names Arpaio, the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office and the county.      Arizona's new law _ most of which a federal judge has put on hold _ mirrors many of the policies Arpaio has put into place in the greater Phoenix area, where he set up a hot line for the public to report immigration violations, conducts crime and immigration sweeps in heavily Latino neighborhoods and frequently raids workplaces for people in the U.S. illegally.      Arpaio believes the inquiry is focused on his immigration sweeps, patrols where deputies flood an area of a city _ in some cases heavily Latino areas _ to seek out traffic violators and arrest other offenders.      Critics say his deputies pull people over for minor traffic infractions because of the color of their skin so they can ask them for their proof of citizenship.      Arpaio denies allegations of racial profiling, saying people are stopped if deputies have probable cause to believe they've committed crimes and that it's only afterward that deputies find many of them are illegal immigrants.      The sheriff's office has said half of the 1,032 people arrested in the sweeps have been illegal immigrants.      Last year, the federal government stripped Arpaio of his special power to enforce federal immigration law. The sheriff continued his sweeps through the enforcement of state immigration laws.      Last year, the nearly 113 million that the county received from the federal government accounted for about 5 percent of the county's 2 billion budget. Arpaio's office said it receives 3 million to 4 million each year in federal funds.      In a separate investigation, a federal grand jury in Phoenix is examining allegations that Arpaio has abused his powers with actions such as intimidating county workers by showing up at their homes at nights and on weekends.      ___      Associated Press writer Paul Davenport contributed to this report. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"The U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office because they refused to provide full access to records and facilities for a civil-rights investigation.

Maria Isabella had just turned sixteen then, and each set of her padrinos had given her (along with the sequined brida du caballo, the dresses of rare tulle, organza, and seda, and the diadema floral du'l dama -- the requisite floral circlet of young womanhood) a purse filled with coins to spend on anything she wanted. And so she'd gone past the Calle du Leones (where sleek cats of various pedigrees sometimes allowed themselves to be purchased, though if so, only until they tired of their new owners), walked through the Avenida du'l Conquistadores (where the statues of the conquerors of Ciudad Meiora lined the entirety of the broad promenade) and made her way to the Encantu lu Caminata (that maze-like series of interconnected streets, each leading to some wonder or marvel for sale), where little musical conch shells from the islets near Palao'an could be found. Those she liked very much. In the vicinity of the Plaza Emperyal, she saw a young man dressed in a coat embroidered with stars walk almost surely to his death. In that instant, Maria Isabella knew two things with the conviction reserved only for the very young: first, that she almost certainly loved this reckless man; and second, that if she simply stepped on a dog's tail -- the very dog watching the same scene unfold right next to her -- she could avert the man's seemingly senseless death.

News article: The Mo Ibrahim Prize for Achievement in African Leadership is the world's most generous prizes. It is also proving to be one of its most elusive, after the prize committee announced on Monday that there was no African leader who met the criteria for the 2013 award.      This is the second year in a row that no suitable candidate has been found. Since its inception in 2007, the prize has only been awarded three times.      Dr Mo Ibrahim, a Sudanese-British telecoms tycoon and philanthropist, established the London-based Mo Ibrahim Foundation to help inspire good governance and exceptional leaders. By finding so few candidates that meet its standards, critics of the award argue it reinforces negative stereotypes about African leaders.      Al Jazeera's Yasmine Ryan spoke with Dr Ibrahim about why the foundation is finding it so hard to find awardees, the relationship between rising inequality and worsening rule of law, and the controversy surrounding the International Criminal Court's (ICC) focus on African leaders.      Al Jazeera: Were there any leaders who might have qualified who were under consideration for the Mo Ibrahim Prize this year?      Mo Ibrahim: Yes of course, I'm not a member of the prize committee, but according to the rules, the committee looks at the people that left office in the last three years, peacefully. It is up to the prize committee to decide whether people meet the standard. We set a very high standard, of course. And we are proud of our prize committee for being credible and tough. It's a prize for excellence, it's not a pension.

MI: We created a brand, a prize, for a specific reason. We should not tinker with that. If there is a need to offer prizes to wonderful parliamentarians, to great newsmen or women, to footballers, or whoever, that's fine. But we should not just mix up things together and destroy the brand we have just because one or two years we don't have a winner.      What is the objective of this? It's focusing on presidents as tools to change their countries, given the power they have. We have not cornered the market on prizes and we invite everybody else to offer prizes for civil society, for the best NGO, for whatever.      Ourselves, we offered a different kind of prize for the Archbishop Desmond Tutu. This was a prize for a brave man who spoke truth to power.      AJ: The Nobel Peace Prize committee is, interestingly, often criticised for the opposite reason; for not being selective enough. Do you think the Nobel Peace Prize committee could learn something from the Mo Ibrahim Foundation?      MI: I will not start by criticising the Nobel Peace Prize committee, because on my committee we have three Nobel Prize winners, and I'm afraid to upset them! [Laughs] So I pass, no comment.      AJ: The Ibrahim Index of African Governance ranking countries according to their performance was also released today. You have said that the information collated in the index is an important empowering tool for citizens in the countries surveyed. In what ways can citizens use this information?      From the 2013 Ibrahim Index of African Governance      MI: This is a scorecard. It shows exactly what has been achieved over the last 13 years. We've been publishing very detailed data over 13 years. We have 133 parameters we measure. It gives people full details: How effective is the police force? How effective is the judiciary? Women's social and economic rights…      This is a wealth of information, for people to see what is strong, to keep doing it, and what needs to be fixed. It also gives an opportunity to compare your performance with that of your neighbour, to enable conversations, peer review. We can pick up the phone and say \\"What are you doing here\\"?      Every time I meet an African president, they open up the index. They love it, because it can help them improve their performance.      AJ: The index shows that the gap between the best and worst countries is widening. Do you think this growing inequality is a uniquely African issue, or you think it is part of a global trend?      MI: There are two areas of inequality. One issue is that we see that eight countries have been in the top ten since the beginning of our data collection. It seems the guys who got it right, they build their institutions and it keeps them on the right path.      At the bottom, actually there have been a lot of changes. The best improvement, actually, has been from some of the countries at the bottom, that managed to get out of poverty and did not fall back into the vicious cycle of poverty.      The second part [of the issue of inequality] is that the fruits of the economic progress, somehow appear to be limited to the top one percent of the population. That is producing a widening gap between the wealthy and the poor. That produces tension. This phenomenon is not just an African phenomenon, it's happening in the US, it's happening in the UK, it's happening everywhere.      This is dangerous. You are building tension inside society. You will reach a point where social cohesion is destroyed.      AJ: The index also showed a trend of worsening levels of personal safety and the rule of law. What are the factors driving these trends?      MI: I just told you.      AJ: That it's due to the inequality?      MI: Exactly. Most of the violence before was happening because of tensions and hostilities across borders. Now it is happening because of conflict within the country. We need to look [at] why are we are lacking social cohesion.      From the 2013 Ibrahim Index of African Governance      AJ: You've spoken in the past about how Africa's youthful population gives it the possibility of becoming the next \\"factory of the world\\". Which countries do you think are best place to do this?      MI: I wouldn't like to pick one country. I think the country that's going to do this is the country that's going to produce a better education for its young people, better training for young people. We need people who are able to serve the new economy. We need people who are versed in the new software, people who are good with their hands, smart kids.      AJ: Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta has called the International Criminal Court \\"imperialist and racist\\", and there are many African leaders who agree with him. Do you think there is any truth to their assertion that the ICC has targeted African leaders unfairly? If so, what's the alternative?      MI: I think there's a need for a serious conversation between the African Union and the ICC. On one hand, the allegation that the ICC has only tried or prosecuted African leaders is correct. Do atrocities only happen in Africa? What is happening in Myanmar, what is happening in Baghdad? Where is the ICC? That's a valid question.      On the other hand, Africa has no alternative to the ICC. We don’t have an African criminal court that is capable of really trying crimes against humanity. So when we have victims in Africa – and we do have victims in many cases – who can give them justice?      Instead of throwing out the baby with the bathwater, we need to find a way to reconcile the two. We need to find a way to the ICC so that it doesn't become just a political tool, as it is perceived by some African leaders.      Global governance is in crisis. Do we say \\"let us withdraw from the United Nations\\"? We love the United Nations, we need the United Nations, what we need to do it to try and reform it, because we need it.      That is the same approach we need to take with the ICC and some of these other global governing bodies. Let’s be cool-headed, and find a way to move forward.

The foundation decided against awarding its 2013 5-million prize for a former African head of state or government demonstrating exceptional leadership. (Carl Court / AFP/Getty Images / )      Most Africans are now better governed than in 2000, but the pace of improvement has slowed, and many countries are experiencing setbacks in public safety and the rule of law, a group dedicated to improving leadership on the continent reported Monday.      The London-based Mo Ibrahim Foundation released its 2013 Index of Good Governance, finding advances in security and justice in only 20 of the continent's 52 countries.      Also lacking, in the judgment of the foundation's prize committee, was any leadership role model for young Africans. For the second year in a row, the foundation decided against awarding its prestigious and lucrative 5-million prize, saying no former African head of state or government deserved it.      To be worthy of the prize -- which pays out the 5 million over 10 years, then provides an annual 200,000 stipend for life -- a recipient must have been democratically elected, have left office within the previous three years after fulfilling his or her elected term and have demonstrated excellence in office and progress in fostering sustainable and equitable prosperity.      The prize was established in 2007 by Sudanese-born telecoms magnate Mo Ibrahim but has found no worthy recipient in four of those seven years.      Previous winners were Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique in 2007, Festus Mogae of Botswana in 2008 and Pedro Pires of Cape Verde in 2011.      The index, also first issued in 2007, provides a framework for citizens, governments, institutions and businesses to assess the delivery of public goods and services and policy outcomes across Africa, the foundation says on its website.      At the top of the foundation's rankings for governance last year were Mauritius, Botswana, Cape Verde, Seychelles and South Africa. Somalia ranked last, with Congo, Eritrea, Central African Republic and Chad rounding out the bottom of the index.      Good governance scores are determined by assessing each African state’s progress since 2000. Although 94% of the continent’s citizens live in countries better governed now than a dozen years ago, the gap between the best- and worst-managed countries has widened and given rise to fears for future African unity, said Salim Ahmed Salim, chairman of the Ibrahim Prize Committee.      Some notable highlights of the latest index were the performance of five countries recovering from armed conflicts: Liberia, Angola, Sierra Leone, Rwanda and Burundi have shown the most improvement since 2000, with Angola and Rwanda posting consistent year-on-year advances, the foundation reported.

Critics argue that the lack of suitable recipients reinforces negative stereotypes about African leaders, as this is the second year in a row that no suitable candidate has been found. The prize, worth 5-million followed by a 200,000 annual stipend for life, is awarded to African leaders who demonstrate excellence in office and have made significant progress in fostering sustainable and equitable prosperity.

Question: Process:  - Air enters the lungs through bronchial tubes - Air enters bronchioles - Bronchioles have tiny air sacs called alveoli - Alveoli surrounded by small blood vessels - Oxygen absorbed by small blood vessels - Vessels deliver oxygen to every cell in the body - Blood brings carbon dioxide back to lungs - Carbon dioxide released when you exhale.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose it is not rainy season happens, how will it affect a SMALLER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis in this case refers to the assumption that the rainy season does not occur, which could potentially lead to a smaller amount of oxygen being delivered in the bloodstream. To evaluate whether such a perturbation might have an effect on the respiratory process mentioned, let's analyze each step of the process and consider the external factors that might be influenced by the absence of the rainy season. 1. Air enters the lungs through bronchial tubes: At this stage, the quality and composition of the air we breathe could potentially be influenced by the weather and climatic conditions. During the rainy season, there is generally more humidity and the air may contain more airborne particles. This might somewhat affect the efficiency of oxygen intake but is not likely to have a significant impact on the overall process. 2. Air enters bronchioles: Here too, the lack of rainy season might not have a direct impact on the process. However, increased humidity during the rainy season can lead to the development of respiratory infections, which could potentially obstruct the bronchioles and affect oxygen distribution. 3. Bronchioles have tiny air sacs called alveoli: The alveoli are responsible for the actual gas exchange, where oxygen is absorbed into the bloodstream and carbon dioxide is released. The condition of the alveoli is crucial for efficient oxygen uptake. The absence of a rainy season might not have a direct effect on the alveoli, but external factors such as air pollution or dry air could indirectly affect the respiratory process. 4. Alveoli surrounded by small blood vessels & oxygen absorbed by small blood vessels: The efficiency of oxygen uptake is determined by the surface area of the alveoli and the effectiveness of small blood vessels. In a dry environment, due to the absence of rainy season, air might become more polluted with particulate matter, which could potentially damage alveoli and blood vessels over time, leading to reduced oxygen absorption. 5. Vessels deliver oxygen to every cell in the body, blood brings carbon dioxide back to lungs, and carbon dioxide released when you exhale: These steps are essential to maintaining a proper balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood. The absence of rainy season might not have a direct impact on these steps, but the effects of external factors such as increased air pollution, increased risk of respiratory infections, and dry air could indirectly affect the overall efficiency of the respiratory process. In conclusion, while it might not have a direct impact on the respiratory process, the absence of rainy season could indirectly affect oxygen delivery to the bloodstream through various external factors such as air quality, humidity, and the likelihood of developing respiratory infections. These factors could potentially lead to a reduced efficiency in the process of oxygen uptake and delivery to the cells, ultimately affecting the body's proper functioning and overall health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Not long ago, people could only buy organic food in small shops. Today it is common in most major supermarkets. The reason for the increase is that more and more people are demanding food grown without chemicals. Since the 1990s, organic farm production has gone up 20 percent every year. This pattern is expected to continue around the globe. Australia leads the world in land used for organic agriculture. It has four times as much land devoted to organic farming as all of Asia. However, most of the land is not very fertile, and it only produces a modest amount of food. Argentina is a distant second, followed by Brazil, the United States and China. In Africa, only a very small amount of land is registered for organic farming. That does not mean Africa relies on chemicals. In fact, many farmers do not use chemicals because they cannot afford them. Yet there are no programs for these farmers to prove they do not use chemicals. Without these programs their food can never be approved organic. India has had the most dramatic recent increase in organic farming. Like many other countries, India sees continual growth in organic food sales around the world. This, of course, leads to growth in profits. Sales of organic food were more than doubled from 2000 to 2005. Like India, many countries are trying to increase commercial organic farming to get a share of the sales. This has led to criticism. Some people believe that organic farming should not just be about making money. They think the goal is to help the environment. Others say organic farming will not continue if it is not profitable. They say that people should be able to make money while providing food that is healthy to mankind. Why do people want to increase organic farming? A) More and more people demand chemicals to grow food. B) Profits from organic farming help make approval programs. C) There are fewer chemicals available to the human beings. D) Organic food is good for the Earth and the human beings. Answer:","output":"D) Organic food is good for the Earth and the human beings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We have the equation -301 * v + 317 * v = 160. First, let's see what we have: we have -301 times v (v is a number we're trying to find) plus 317 times v, and that equals 160. Now, let's combine the two parts with v together. So we get (-301 + 317) * v = 160.  If we do the math inside the parentheses first (-301 + 317), we get 16. Our new equation now looks like this: 16 * v = 160. Now, we want to find out what v is, so we'll divide both sides of the equation by 16. This will help us find v. So, let's do this: (16 * v) / 16 = 160 / 16. Since 16 divided by 16 equals 1, we're left with: v = 10. There you go, buddy! The answer is v = 10."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Cut the flowers when they start to look yellow or black.;  (c). To find a good drainage location, find the spot in your garden that dries out the quickest after a pour of rain. If there is no obvious location, plant your lilies on a slope, and let gravity take care of your drainage.;  (d). Alternatively, a warmer ground would be good for lilies, with partial shade and good drainage.

To find a good drainage location, find the spot in your garden that dries out the quickest after a pour of rain. If there is no obvious location, plant your lilies on a slope, and let gravity take care of your drainage.  Caring for lilies involves more than just selecting the right location. To ensure the healthy growth and flowering of your lilies, you must also follow other appropriate care and planting practices. Here are some detailed steps to help you take care of your lilies: 1. Soil preparation: Lilies prefer slightly acidic soil with a pH between 6 and 6.5. Amend the soil with organic matter, such as peat moss or compost, to improve its acidity, structure, and nutrient content. This will encourage healthy root development and ensure proper drainage. 2. Planting: Plant lily bulbs in the early spring or fall, depending on the variety. Dig a hole that is 5-6 inches deep, placing the bulb with the pointed end facing up. Space the bulbs 8-12 inches apart to allow for growth and airflow. 3. Watering: Lilies need consistent moisture to thrive, but overly wet soil may cause bulb rot. Water your lilies deeply and regularly (about once or twice a week), ensuring the soil is continuously moist but not waterlogged. 4. Fertilizing: Apply a slow-release, balanced fertilizer, such as a 10-10-10 or 14-14-14 blend, when you plant the bulbs and every spring thereafter. Avoid using high-nitrogen fertilizers, as they promote excessive leaf growth at the expense of flowers. 5. Mulching: Mulch the area around your lilies to maintain consistent soil moisture and temperature, while also discouraging the growth of weeds. Use organic mulch materials, like shredded leaves or bark, to help further enrich the soil. 6. Staking: Some lily varieties have tall, slender stems that may require staking for support. Use a gentle stake or plant support to prevent the stem from breaking or bending. 7. Pruning: Deadhead faded blooms to promote more flowering and maintain a tidy appearance. When cutting flowers for arrangements, be careful not to remove too many leaves from the plant to ensure it retains the energy necessary for bulb development. 8. Pest and disease control: Keep an eye out for aphids, slugs, and other pests that can affect your lilies. Use natural pest control methods or insecticides when needed. Also, be mindful of diseases such as lily mosaic virus and botrytis, and take appropriate measures to keep your plants healthy. 9. Winter care: In colder climates, protect your lily bulbs from freezing temperatures by applying a thick layer of mulch before the ground freezes. Remove the mulch in early spring when the risk of frost has passed. By following these comprehensive care steps and choosing the appropriate location with good drainage and sufficient sunlight, you can ensure your lilies will grow healthily and produce beautiful blooms for you to enjoy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How many TD's did the Eagles score in the first half?","output":"The Eagles scored three touchdowns in the first half of the game against the Niners. These touchdowns were scored through a blocked punt recovery, an interception return, and a punt return. Despite the lead they established early in the game, they were unable to maintain it due to effective defensive strategies from the Niners that prevented the Eagles' offense - which had led the league in scoring through the first 3 weeks of the season - from contributing any points to their score. The Niners came back in the second half, countered by two touchdown passes by Colin Kaepernick and four field goals by Phil Dawson, eventually taking the lead with a score of 26-21. Towards the end of the game, the Eagles had an opportunity to shift the balance as they moved to the Niner's one-yard line, but this potential was unfulfilled as they turned over the ball on downs. Ultimately, the Niners out performed the Eagles both defensively and offensively, facilitating their win over the Eagles as reflected by the stats: with the Niners gaining 407 yards to the Eagles' 213, and holding the ball for 42:17."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Silent Joe Should Have Stayed Mum Review: One of the worst books I've read through in a long, long time. If it got 43 5 star reviews all I can guess is that the author has a huge extended family to write them for him. In the past year and a half I've read a lot of free Kindle books and this had the sloppiest formatting of any I've come across. There must have been more than ONE HUNDRED missing periods, commas and quotation marks. Talk about slopping spellcheck? Time after time the reader comes across things that look like the jokes one sees about how auto correct screws things up. Even for free this book wasn't worth it. A:","output":"Based on the review provided, the customer appears to be highly dissatisfied with their experience reading the book 'Silent Joe.' There are several factors indicating their level of dissatisfaction, which are outlined below: 1. Negative overall tone: The review begins with a strong negative statement, asserting that it is \\"one of the worst books\\" the customer has read. This opinion sets an overwhelmingly negative tone for the rest of the review. 2. Questioning positive reviews: The customer expresses skepticism about the 43 5-star reviews the book has received, suggesting that the author’s extended family might have written them. This insinuates that the customer not only dislikes the book but also doubts others' genuine appreciation for it. 3. Mentioning numerous formatting errors: The customer details a significant amount of formatting issues they encountered while reading, citing more than a hundred missing periods, commas, and quotation marks. Such errors would likely disrupt the reading experience and may contribute to the customer's overall dissatisfaction with the book. 4. Criticizing the use of spellcheck: The customer goes on to express their frustration with the book's numerous spelling and grammar errors, which they liken to auto-correct mistakes. They also mention encountering these errors \\"time after time,\\" suggesting that the prevalence of these issues made it challenging to enjoy the book. 5. Claiming that the book is not worth it, even for free: The review ends with the customer stating that the book \\"wasn't worth it\\" despite being a free Kindle book. By asserting that the book holds no value, even when offered at no cost, the customer demonstrates a strongly negative opinion and high level of dissatisfaction with their reading experience. In conclusion, with the negative tone, questioning of positive reviews, highlighting of formatting and spellcheck issues, and a strong statement that the book wasn't worth their time, we can confidently determine that the customer who left this review was thoroughly dissatisfied with 'Silent Joe.'"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Le principe d'égalité et de non-discrimination est un concept fondamental dans les sociétés démocratiques et constitue la base de nombreuses lois et réglementations. Il s'agit essentiellement de garantir que chaque individu soit traité de manière équitable et égale, quelle que soit sa race, son sexe, son origine ethnique, sa religion, son handicap, son orientation sexuelle ou toute autre caractéristique personnelle. Ce principe revêt une grande importance, car il témoigne du respect et de la dignité humaine, permettant ainsi une coexistence harmonieuse et pacifique parmi les différentes communautés. La non-discrimination est un élément clé de ce principe et vise à garantir que toutes les personnes bénéficient des mêmes droits et opportunités, sans discrimination ni préférence injustifiée. Cela signifie que chaque individu doit avoir un accès égal aux ressources, aux services et aux décisions qui ont un impact sur sa vie, tout en ayant le droit d'être protégé contre le harcèlement, la violence et toute autre forme de mauvais traitement. Dans cette optique, le principe d'égalité et de non-discrimination peut être abordé de différentes manières en fonction du contexte et des besoins spécifiques. Par exemple, cela peut se traduire par la mise en place de mesures d'égalité des chances et de diversité en milieu professionnel, l'élaboration de politiques publiques favorisant l'égalité d'accès à l'éducation et à la santé, la lutte contre les discriminations et les préjugés, ainsi que la promotion de l'égalité des droits pour les groupes marginalisés et défavorisés. En outre, de nombreuses organisations et institutions internationales, telles que les Nations Unies, l'Union européenne et d'autres organisations régionales, ont adopté des conventions, des directives et des normes visant à promouvoir et à protéger le principe d'égalité et de non-discrimination au niveau mondial. Par exemple, la Déclaration universelle des droits de l'homme, le Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et politiques et la Convention sur l'élimination de toutes les formes de discrimination à l'égard des femmes sont autant de textes qui incarnent ce principe et prévoient des mécanismes pour assurer son respect et sa mise en œuvre. En résumé, le principe d'égalité et de non-discrimination est un pilier important des sociétés démocratiques et justes, qui s'efforcent de garantir l'égalité des chances, la dignité et le respect pour tous les individus, indépendamment de leurs caractéristiques personnelles ou de leur appartenance à un groupe particulier. Il est essentiel de continuer à promouvoir et à protéger ce principe en élaborant des politiques publiques, des réglementations et des initiatives qui visent à renforcer l'égalité, à lutter contre la discrimination et à garantir un traitement équitable pour tous.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I have a new situation: Two colleagues read about types of chemical reactions. Sean studied about the influence of temperature on chemical reactions. Gabe studied about other influencing factors.  But I can use this background: Raising the temperature of a chemical reaction usually results in a higher rate of reaction. When the reactant particles are heated, they move faster and faster. This results in a greater frequency of collisions. A more important effect of the temperature increase is that the collisions occur with a greater force and are thus more likely to surmount the activation energy barrier and go on to form products. Increasing the temperature of a reaction increases the number of effective collisions between reacting particles, so the reaction rate increases.  What is an answer for this question: Which student read more about reactant particles being heated? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Identify the information given in the question The user provided information about two colleagues studying different aspects of chemical reactions: Sean studied about the influence of temperature on chemical reactions, and Gabe studied about other influencing factors.

What was the old process to bleach before it's invention? Question 2: How do I bleach my hair without bleach? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Question 1: Who discovered bleaching powder? What was the old process to bleach before its invention? The Scottish chemist, Charles Tennant, discovered bleaching powder, also known as calcium hypochlorite, in the year 1798. Tennant initially produced the compound by reacting slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) with chlorine gas. The resulting substance, bleaching powder, revolutionized the textile industry due to its superior ability to remove color from fabrics, making the process of bleaching an easier and more efficient undertaking. Prior to the invention of bleaching powder, the most common method of bleaching fabrics was using a process called \\"sun-bleaching,\\" which required exposing the materials to direct sunlight for an extended period. This method was both time-consuming and labor-intensive. Additionally, another method called \\"souring\\" was used, which involved soaking the fabrics in a diluted solution of lactic or sulfuric acid. Both sun-bleaching and souring were far less efficient than what bleaching powder could offer and came with certain limitations in their effectiveness. Question 2: How do I bleach my hair without bleach? Bleaching your hair without using bleach can be done in various ways by using alternative ingredients or methods, although the results might not be as drastic or long-lasting as using a bleach solution. Some of the options to lighten hair without bleach are: 1. Lemon Juice – Lemon juice has natural citric acid which can help lighten hair. Mix equal parts of lemon juice and with water, spray it onto your hair, and comb through to ensure even distribution. Expose your hair to sunlight, and let it sit for 2-3 hours before taking a shower. You might need to repeat this method a few times to see significant lightening. 2. Honey – Honey is a natural lightening agent and also works as a moisturizer, leaving your hair healthy. Mix honey and water (or apple cider vinegar for better results) and apply it to your hair. Leave the mixture for about an hour before washing it out. 3. Cinnamon: Mixing cinnamon with a moisturizing hair conditioner could help lighten your hair. Apply the mixture to your hair, cover with a shower cap, and leave it overnight. Rinse it off in the morning. 4. Apple Cider Vinegar – Apple cider vinegar is known for lightening hair over time. Dilute it with water and use it as a hair rinse after shampooing. This method requires consistent application to notice significant results. 5. Chamomile Tea – Rinsing your hair with chamomile tea can result in a subtle lightening effect. Brew strong chamomile tea, let it cool, and rinse your hair with it after shampooing. It is important to note that these methods may have varying results depending on your hair type, color, and texture. Regarding whether questions 1 and 2 are asking the same thing: No, these questions are not the same. Question 1 is asking about the discovery of bleaching powder and how fabrics were bleached before its invention. Meanwhile, Question 2 is asking for alternatives to bleach when lightening hair. Although both questions involve the concept of \\"bleaching,\\" they focus on different subjects, one on the textile industry and the other on hair care."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the first building at Covent Garden? ?  The central square in Covent Garden is simply called \\"Covent Garden\\", often marketed as \\"Covent Garden Piazza\\" to distinguish it from the eponymous surrounding area. Designed and laid out in 1630, it was the first modern square in London—originally a flat, open space or piazza with low railings. From about 1635 onwards there were many private residents of note, including the nobility, living in the Great Piazza. A casual market started on the south side, and by 1830 the present market hall had been built. The space is popular with street performers, who audition with the site's owners for an allocated slot. The square was originally laid out when the 4th Earl of Bedford, Francis Russell, commissioned Inigo Jones to design and build a church and three terraces of fine houses around the site of a former walled garden belonging to Westminster Abbey. Jones's design was informed by his knowledge of modern town planning in Europe, particularly Piazza d'Arme, in Leghorn, Tuscany, Piazza San Marco in Venice, Piazza Santissima Annunziata in Florence, and the Place des Vosges in Paris. The centrepiece of the project was the large square, the concept of which was new to London, and this had a significant influence on modern town planning as the metropolis grew, acting as the prototype for the design of new estates, such as the Ladbroke Estate and the Grosvenor Estate. Isaac de Caus, the French Huguenot architect, designed the individual houses under Jones's overall design.The church of St Paul's was the first building, and was begun in July 1631 on the western side of the square. The last house was completed in 1637. Seventeen of the houses had arcaded portico walks organised in groups of four and six either side of James Street on the north side, and three and four either side of Russell Street. These arcades, rather than the square itself, took the name Piazza; the group from James Street to Russell Street became known as the \\"Great Piazza\\" and that to the south of Russell Street as the \\"Little Piazza\\".

The cardinal in question then ranks in precedence with those raised to the cardinalate at the time of his in pectore appointment. If a pope dies before revealing the identity of an in pectore cardinal, the cardinalate expires.\\". Can you tell me what it is? The answer is:","output":"The time constraint that a pope can reveal the identity of an in pectore cardinal is not fixed and depends on the specific conditions and circumstances surrounding the appointment. The pope may choose to reveal the identity of the cardinal at any time, if he judges that it is safe and appropriate to do so. This decision is typically based on factors such as political or religious circumstances, safety concerns for the individual in question, or any other factors that may have initially prompted the in pectore appointment. Once the pope reveals the identity of the in pectore cardinal, the cardinal ranks in precedence with those who were raised to the cardinalate at the time of his initial in pectore appointment. This means that he assumes the same rights, privileges, and responsibilities as other cardinals within the Church hierarchy, despite not having been publicly acknowledged as such earlier. It is important to note that if a pope dies before revealing the identity of an in pectore cardinal, the cardinalate expires and the individual does not become a public cardinal. In such cases, the in pectore appointment essentially becomes null and void, as the decision to reveal or not reveal the identity ultimately lies with the reigning pope and does not pass on to his successors. This underscores the inherently confidential and sensitive nature of in pectore cardinal appointments, which provide flexibility for the pope in managing Church affairs while ensuring the safety and well-being of those appointed under such conditions."},{"instruction":"If I tell you that Alternation of generations allows for creating young by asexual and sexual means, and ask you the question \\"what allows for an organism to create young by sexual and asexual means?\\", is the correct answer \\"spread flower seeds\\"?

His form of transport is his recently received birthday present - and it most certainly is not a Jaguar. His eccentric parents have decided to pass on their pride and joy to Danny for his use. Their 1963 Nissan Cedric has been in the family for years and is immaculate  but extremely uncool. Danny is aghast at the thought of driving around in a car as dorky as a Cedric and, with the promise of a date with Joanna and the need for a Jaguar in a hurry, decides to trade in the old Nissan. He heads out to search the car yards to find his dream machine.

Summarize the following: Some foods reduce inflammation in your body, which is helpful for reducing your psoriasis flare-ups and relieving existing symptoms. Base your meals around fresh produce, fatty fish, beans, nuts, and legumes. Cook your foods using healthy oils, and season your dishes with fresh herbs and spices. Choose fruit for your snacks or desserts.  The best vegetable options include leafy greens, broccoli, beets, celery, cabbage, carrots, peas, Brussels sprouts, tomatoes, and bok choy. Healthy oils include olive oil, borage oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, grapeseed oil, and avocado oil. Anti-inflammatory herbs include cayenne pepper, ginger, cloves, and turmeric. Omega-3 fatty acids help reduce inflammation in your body, so they can help reduce your risk of flare-ups. They also support your immune system! Choose foods high in omega-3s at least 3-4 times per week.  Good sources of omega-3s include fatty fish (such as salmon, cod, or halibut), nuts, vegetable oils, flaxseeds, flaxseed oil, and leafy vegetables.  You can also take an omega-3 fish oil supplement. However, talk to your doctor before taking any supplements. Red meat can trigger flare-ups because it causes inflammation in your body, so it's best to avoid it. Instead, choose leaner proteins like chicken, fish, tofu, and beans. If you enjoy eating red meat, choose lean cuts of meat like sirloin, round, or loin. Before you cook the meat, make sure you cut off as much fat as possible. Processed foods that are high in sodium, sugar, and trans fats trigger inflammation in your body. This can cause flare-ups. Stay away from baked goods, packaged snacks, frozen dinners, canned soups, and deli meats. Instead, choose fresh, whole foods. Although they are lightly processed, frozen meats, frozen vegetables, and whole grains can be a healthy addition to your diet. Sugar can also cause inflammation, so it's important to keep it to a minimum. Cut out baked goods, candy, ice cream, and other treats. Additionally, read food labels to look out for added sugars. When you want a yummy treat, opt for a piece of fruit instead of a sugary snack. If you're sensitive to dairy, switch to non-dairy products, like soy milk or almond milk. In addition to milk replacements, you can find non-dairy yogurt and ice cream. Not everyone is triggered by dairy. If it doesn't seem to affect you, dairy can be a healthy part of your diet. Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease, so a healthy immune system can help reduce flare-ups. Probiotics help balance the healthy bacteria in your body. You can find them in yogurt and fermented foods. As another option, you can take a probiotics supplement.  If you can eat yogurt without triggering your psoriasis, it can be a convenient, easy way to get more probiotics in your diet. Fermented foods you can try include sauerkraut, kimchi, kombucha, miso, tempeh, and kefir. Turmeric, which is packed with antioxidants, relieves inflammation in your body. It can help reduce your psoriasis flare-ups, as well as relieve your symptoms if you're already experiencing a flare-up. You can add turmeric to your dishes as a spice to increase your consumption. If you don't like the taste of turmeric, you can take it as a supplement. Talk to your doctor before you take any supplements. by drinking at least 11.5 cups (2.7 L) daily. Water helps flush out your system and is part of your body's natural detox process. How much water you need daily will depend on your age, gender, and activity levels. If you feel thirsty or have dark urine, increase your fluid intake.  In general, women need about 11.5 cups (2.7 L) of water each day, while men need 15.5 cups (3.7 L) of water daily. You don't have to just drink water! Fluids like tea, juice, soup broth, smoothies, etc. all contribute to your water intake.","output":"The text states that certain foods can help reduce inflammation in the body, which mitigates psoriasis flare-ups and alleviates existing symptoms.

Instead, leaner proteins such as chicken, fish, tofu, and beans are recommended, as well as fresh, whole foods. While some lightly processed foods like frozen meats, vegetables, and whole grains can be included in the diet, it is essential to eliminate or severely reduce sugar intake. Dairy sensitivity can trigger psoriasis in some individuals, so non-dairy alternatives such as soy or almond milk, non-dairy yogurt, and ice cream are suggested for them. Probiotics are recommended for all as they help balance healthy bacteria, supporting the immune system, which can help reduce psoriasis flare-ups. Probiotics can be found in yogurt and fermented foods or supplements. The spice turmeric is highlighted as particularly beneficial due to its antioxidant properties, which help reduce inflammation, thereby reducing psoriasis flare-ups. It can be consumed through cooking or as a supplement, although the latter should only be taken after consulting with a doctor. Additionally, drinking plenty of fluids, particularly water, is essential for detoxifying the body. Women are advised to drink 11.5 cups of fluids daily, while men should aim for 15.5 cups.

Part #2: Avoiding usage of irrelevant extra information. Usage: \\"Just call me John.\\" This response avoids adding unnecessary information such as where John is from or what he does for a living, focusing solely on providing his name as per the agent's request. Part #3: Making sure the response is relevant to the question before the blank.

Answer the following question: Process:  - A mine is excavated in the side of a mountain - Miners enter the mine - Miners remove the coal from the mine - The coal is placed into carts or on a conveyor belt - The coal is moved up to the surface - The coal is loaded onto a truck - The truck takes the coal to a power station.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less coal is loaded happens, how will it affect LESS coal arriving at the power station.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis in this scenario suggests that if less coal is loaded onto the trucks, it will result in less coal arriving at the power station. To analyze the effect of this perturbation, we can break it down step-by-step to determine the direct and indirect impacts on the overall process. 1. A mine is excavated in the side of a mountain:    The perturbation does not have any direct or indirect effect on this step, as the mine's excavation is independent of the quantity of coal loaded onto the trucks. 2. Miners enter the mine:    Similarly, the perturbation does not affect this step, as miners entering the mine are not influenced by the quantity of coal loaded onto the trucks. 3. Miners remove the coal from the mine:    The perturbation hypothesis might have an indirect effect on this step. If less coal is loaded onto the trucks, it could potentially indicate lower demand or a slower removal process. In such cases, the miners may remove coal at a decreased rate. 4. The coal is placed into carts or on a conveyor belt:    The perturbation hypothesis can have a direct effect on this step. If less coal is loaded onto the trucks, it would naturally mean that fewer carts or a shorter conveyor belt are necessary to hold the transported coal. 5. The coal is moved up to the surface:    The perturbation has a direct effect on this step, as moving less coal to the surface means that coal extraction operates at a reduced rate or that there is less demand for the coal at the power station. 6. The coal is loaded onto a truck:    This is the step where the perturbation has a direct effect. Loading less coal onto the truck means reduced transportation capacity or lower overall demand for coal at the power station. 7. The truck takes the coal to a power station:    The perturbation hypothesis has a direct effect on this step. With less coal being transported, the power station will receive a lesser amount of coal, which could result in decreased energy production or even stoppage if the coal supply is insufficient. In summary, the proposed perturbation of loading less coal onto trucks will have a direct effect on the process in terms of coal transportation to the power station and potential impacts on energy production. It may also have indirect effects on other steps in the process, such as the removal of coal from the mine if it indicates lower demand or a decreased rate of removal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Taste the dish: Before you begin, taste the dish to get a sense of its flavors. This will help you identify which flavors are already present and which ones could use a boost. 2. Use fresh ingredients: Whenever possible, use fresh ingredients instead of dried or canned ones. Fresh herbs, spices, fruits, and vegetables tend to have a stronger and more vibrant taste compared to their dried or canned counterparts. 3. Season with salt and pepper: Add salt and pepper to the dish. Salt helps to enhance the natural flavors of the food, while pepper adds a subtle heat and sharpness. Start with a small amount and adjust according to taste. 4. Balance flavors: Balance the flavors in your dish by considering the five basic tastes – sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami. Adjust the dish accordingly by adding a bit of sugar or honey for sweetness, lemon juice or vinegar for acidity, soy sauce or fish sauce for umami, or even a dash of bitter ingredients like cocoa or coffee. 5. Add aromatic ingredients: Aromatic ingredients such as garlic, onion, herbs, and spices can help accentuate flavors in a dish. Be sure to sauté or toast your aromatics before adding them to the dish to release their essential oils and enhance their flavor. 6. Use fats: Fats, like butter or oil, can help to carry flavor throughout the dish. They can also give a richer mouthfeel, enhancing the overall taste and texture. Use fats judiciously to support the flavors without overpowering the dish. 7. Layer flavors: Add ingredients at different stages of the cooking process to build complexity and depth of flavor. For example, add some fresh herbs during cooking and then finish the dish with a sprinkle of the same herb to create layers of flavor. 8. Adjust cooking methods: Different cooking methods can bring out different flavors in ingredients. For instance, roasting vegetables can caramelize their natural sugars, while searing meat can create a flavorful crust that enhances taste. 9. Add acidity: An acidic element, such as vinegar, citrus juice, or wine, can help brighten the flavors of a dish and make them more pronounced. Add a small amount at a time, tasting as you go, to achieve the desired effect. 10. Allow the dish to rest: After you've made adjustments to the flavors of your dish, allow it to rest for a short period before serving. This will give the flavors time to meld and strengthen. By following these steps, you can accentuate the flavors in your dish, ensuring that they are bold, balanced, and delicious. Remember to taste your dish periodically during the cooking process and make adjustments as needed to create a harmonious and flavorful dish."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Let's break down the differences and similarities between the two: Similarities: 1. Both sentences involve interacting with Fred and making him a new partner. 2. Both sentences mention going to the Cratchit house. 3. Both sentences discuss an improvement in conditions for Bob (the first refers to him as \\"Bob,\\" and the second refers to him as \\"the Cratchit\\"). Differences: 1. In the first sentence, the subject \\"he\\" visits Fred, while in the second sentence, he \\"rehires\\" Fred. The term \\"rehire\\" implies that Fred was previously employed by the subject and is now being brought back onboard, while \\"visits\\" does not imply any prior employment relationship. 2. In the first sentence, the subject goes to the Cratchit house and \\"restores\\" Bob. This phrasing suggests that Bob may have been in a worse situation previously, and the subject makes it right by \\"restoring\\" him. The second sentence doesn't convey the same intensity, as it simply mentions that the subject \\"visits\\" Bob at the Cratchit house without any implications of repairing a situation. 3. In the first sentence, the subject increases Bob's \\"reward.\\" This phrase is more ambiguous in its meaning compared to the second sentence, which explicitly states that Bob's \\"wages\\" are increased. The term \\"reward\\" could potentially refer to any form of compensation or benefit that Bob receives, while \\"wages\\" specifically refers to monetary compensation for employment.

Before you can train your dog or cat out of sleeping on the couch or bed, you'll need to give your pet a comfortable alternative. You probably won't have much luck keeping your pet off the furniture if you don't provide some kind of alternative.","output":"Purchase a pet bed that suits your furry friend's size and preferences. Some pets like to stretch out, while others prefer a more enclosed, cave-like space. Observe your pet's sleeping habits to determine what type of bed would best suit their needs. Also, consider their age and any health issues they may have – older pets and those with joint problems may benefit from a more cushioned, supportive bed to provide relief. Place their new bed in an area that is safe, quiet, and familiar to them. This will help make the bed more enticing and become their preferred sleeping spot. Introduce the new bed to your pet. Once you've chosen the perfect bed, introduce it to your pet slowly. Let them sniff it and explore it, and provide praise and treats when they show interest in it. Building a positive association with the bed early on will encourage your pet to choose it as their sleeping spot in the future. Implement consistent training techniques. Consistency is key when it comes to training your pet to stay off the furniture. Incorporate the use of commands such as \\"off\\" or \\"down\\" if your pet tries to jump onto the furniture. Be sure to reward them with praise and treats when they comply and redirect them to their pet bed. Remember not to scold or punish your pet during this process, as it may reinforce negative associations and hinder your progress. Create barriers to keep your pet off the furniture. If your pet is persistent in their attempts to use your furniture, consider using deterrents such as furniture covers, tin foil, or plastic mats with spikes on the surface. These will make the furniture less appealing and will help reinforce your training efforts. Alternatively, you could use baby gates or pet playpens to limit your pet's access to certain rooms when you're not able to supervise them. Use positive reinforcement and rewards. Reinforcing your pet's good behavior with praise, treats, and affection will make it more likely for them to continue choosing their bed over your furniture. Make a habit of rewarding your pet when you catch them using their designated sleeping area, and try to make their bed as comfortable and appealing as possible by placing toys, blankets, or even an item of your clothing nearby to create a familiar scent. Involve the entire household in the training process. In order for your pet to understand that the furniture is off-limits, it's crucial for everyone in the household to be on the same page about enforcing the rule. Consistency in your family's interactions with your pet will reinforce the training and lead to a successful transition. Lastly, be patient. Changing your pet's habits may take time. Stay consistent, positive, and determined in your efforts, and you'll soon help your pet understand the boundaries and make their new cozy bed their favorite spot at home. Remember that this transition is not only about keeping your furniture clean and fur-free but also about promoting a healthy and positive lifestyle for your beloved pet."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: When you’re nervous, your muscles lock up and your breathing gets irregular, which can negatively impact your performance. To counteract this, close your eyes and take big, deep breaths to relax. Hold the breath for 3-5 seconds, then slowly let it out. Stage fright is natural, and something that many performers struggle with. One thing not to do when you’re nervous is to run away from the feeling—that makes it seem even scarier. Instead, take a step back and look at your anxiety objectively. Tell yourself your nerves are normal and OK to have, and that they can even make you a better performer!  Being nervous isn’t something to be afraid of. It might not feel comfortable, but you know you’re strong enough to handle the discomfort and perform your best anyway. For example, you could tell yourself, “This is a big recital, so of course I’m nervous. That’s OK. I’m going to perform the best I can anyway.” with focused, positive thoughts about the performance. Being nervous means that you have adrenaline coursing through your body, and that can be a good thing before a big performance. Instead of allowing that adrenaline to run wild and make you nervous and worried, focus it into positive thoughts and actions to boost your confidence.  For example, you could channel your adrenaline into physical movement, such as drumming your fingers or nodding your head. You could also walk or even dance around to get out your jitters. Mentally, use your energy to acknowledge your worried thoughts, then turn towards excited, upbeat ones. Think about how hard you’ve worked for this, how excited you are, and how ready you feel. Many performers find that some healthy pre-show jitters give them the burst of adrenaline they need to give an amazing show. Embrace your nerves as a way to help you perform your best. Bad nerves can sometimes send you into a worry spiral that’s hard to break out of. Stop the cycle before it starts by first noticing when you begin to worry. Stop yourself and accept that you feel nervous, but that that feeling doesn’t have to control you.  For example, you might find yourself thinking something like, “I’m not prepared for this. I’m going to mess everything up.” Instead of continuing in this vein, say, “This just means I have some nerves. I practiced hard for this. It’s natural to be nervous, but it doesn’t mean I’m going to mess up.” If you’re worrying about past mistakes or failures, try saying to yourself, “I’ve worked hard since then and learned from mistakes. I’ve improved a lot, and now I get the chance to show it.” Sit or stand in a comfortable position and close your eyes. Picture yourself giving a great performance, and let yourself feel those emotions—confidence, strength, elation, and more. Letting that image fill you up will give you the boost of confidence you need to make it a reality. Positive visualization has been proven to improve performance in many different arenas, so give it a shot! You still might feel a rush of nerves when you step onstage. Instead of freezing up, channel that nervous energy into a big smile or an enthusiastic wave or gesture. This is a great way to cover up your anxiety while connecting with the audience.  If you’re a musician, you could smile, nod to the crowd, and walk briskly to your spot. In less formal settings, you could even jump around or run onstage. If you’re acting or giving a speech, walk on confidently and in character. If you’re dancing, walk onstage as you’ve rehearsed, smiling or looking confidently at the crowd if it matches the mood of your performance.","output":"If you ever feel nervous before an important event like a show or a speech, it's totally okay. Everyone gets nervous. When you get nervous, your body might feel tight and your breathing might feel funny. But did you know, you can actually control this? By simply breathing slowly, deeply and closing your eyes, you can help relax your body. Remember, being nervous isn't bad! It just means your body is getting ready for something exciting. In fact, nerves can make you do better! When you feel jumpy or wiggly because you're nervous, instead of letting that scare you, make it work for you. You can move around, like tapping your fingers, or imagining yourself doing great in your performance. This can help you feel better. If you find yourself getting worried, stop and remind yourself that it's okay to be nervous. You've worked hard and prepared, so you don't have to worry about messing up. You can even pretend that you're not nervous by smiling or waving when you get on stage or start your performance. Remember, even if you are feeling a little bit nervous, it doesn't mean you're not ready. You can still do great!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Folk dancers stomp loudly in Gilbert's room just above Iris, making it impossible for Miss Froy to properly hear a musician singing a haunting melody out in the street. Iris bribes the manager to throw Gilbert out of his room. Gilbert retaliates by barging into Iris's room and refusing to leave.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Andrew Luck-Baker describes his rescue experience      Rescuers in Antarctica have safely transferred all 52 passengers stranded on the ice-bound research vessel Akademik Shokalskiy.      The Australian rescue operators said the scientists and tourists were now all aboard the ship Aurora Australis.      They were flown there in groups by a helicopter from a Chinese ice-breaker.      The Shokalskiy has been trapped since 24 December. Its 22 crew are expected to remain on board to wait until the vessel becomes free.      The Shokalskiy was trapped by thick sheets of ice driven by strong winds, about 1,500 nautical miles south of Hobart - the capital of the Australian state of Tasmania.      The vessel was being used by the Australasian Antarctic Expedition to follow the route explorer Douglas Mawson travelled a century ago.      'White-knuckle ride'      \\"We've made it to the Aurora australis safe & sound. A huge thanks to the Chinese & @AusAntarctic for all their hard work!,\\" expedition leader Chris Turney tweeted.      The helicopter belongs to the Chinese icebreaker, Xue Long, and each flight took about 45 minutes, round-trip.

The passengers were taken to an ice floe next to the Aurora Australis and then ferried on to the ice-breaker by a small boat.

But it later reported: \\"Aurora Australis has advised Amsa that the 52 passengers from the Akademik Shokalskiy are now on board.\\"      The passengers are not expected back in Tasmania until mid-January.      Several attempts to break through to the ship by sea - by the Xue Long, Aurora Australis and French-flagged L'Astrolabe - failed because of the thickness of the ice.      Andrew Luck-Baker says the Aurora Australis, although big, was simply not up to the task and there is speculation two larger vessels may be coming to the area in the weeks to come.      Despite being trapped, the scientists continued their experiments, measuring temperature and salinity through cracks in the surrounding ice.      One of the aims was to track how quickly the Antarctic's sea ice was disappearing.      The ship had plenty of stocks and was never in danger. ||||| CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — A long-awaited rescue of passengers on board a research ship that has been trapped in Antarctic ice for more than a week finally got underway on Thursday, with a helicopter scooping up the first group of passengers and flying them to a nearby vessel, expedition leaders said.

(Associated Press)      The helicopter was originally going to airlift the passengers to a Chinese icebreaker, the Snow Dragon, with a barge then ferrying them to an Australian vessel. But sea ice was preventing a barge from reaching the Snow Dragon, and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's Rescue Coordination Centre, which is overseeing the rescue, said the operation would consequently be delayed.      A last-minute change in plans allowed the rescue to go ahead. The 52 scientists and tourists on board were instead being flown to an ice floe next to the Australian icebreaker the Aurora Australis, and then taken by a small boat to the Australian ship, expedition leader Chris Turney said. The maritime authority confirmed the first group arrived at the Aurora Thursday evening.      \\"I think everyone is relieved and excited to be going on to the Australian icebreaker and then home,\\" Turney told The Associated Press by satellite phone from the Russian ship MV Akademik Shokalski, which has been stuck in the ice since Christmas Eve.      The helicopter will carry the passengers a dozen at a time in an operation expected to take five hours. All 22 crew members are planning to stay with their icebound vessel, which is not in danger.      The Aurora will carry the passengers to the Australian island state of Tasmania, arriving by mid-January.      The eagerly anticipated rescue came after days of failed attempts to reach the ship. Blinding snow, strong winds, fog and thick sea ice forced rescuers to turn back time and again.      Three icebreakers were initially dispatched to try and crack their way through the ice surrounding the vessel, but all failed. The Aurora came within 20 kilometers (12 miles) of the ship Monday, but fierce winds and snow forced it to retreat to open water.      The Akademik Shokalskiy, which left New Zealand on Nov. 28, got stuck after a blizzard pushed the sea ice around the ship, freezing it in place about 2,700 kilometers (1,700 miles) south of Hobart, Tasmania. The ship isn't in danger of sinking and has weeks' worth of supplies on board, but it cannot move.      The scientific team on board had been recreating Australian explorer Douglas Mawson's 1911 to 1913 voyage to Antarctica. Turney had hoped to continue the trip if an icebreaker managed to free the ship.      __      Associated Press writer Kristen Gelineau in Sydney contributed to this report. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Rescuers in Antarctica have safely transferred all 52 passengers stranded on the ice-bound research vessel Akademik Shokalskiy to the ship Aurora Australis.

The early Austrian attack surprised the French; Napoleon himself was still in Paris when he heard about the invasion. He arrived at Donauwörth on the 17th to find the Grande Armée in a dangerous position, with its two wings separated by 75 miles (121 km) and joined together by a thin cordon of Bavarian troops. Charles pressed the left wing of the French army and hurled his men towards the III Corps of Marshal Davout. In response, Napoleon came up with a plan to cut off the Austrians in the celebrated Landshut Maneuver. He realigned the axis of his army and marched his soldiers towards the town of Eckmühl. The French scored a convincing win in the resulting Battle of Eckmühl, forcing Charles to withdraw his forces over the Danube and into Bohemia.

Answer the following question: Everybody knew Shandor Marley's mother liked to spend more time flirting with serial killers than she did taking care of things at home. So when her son went round with an air rifle popping his neighbours like they were allotment pigeons, they figured all the boy really needed was a bit of attention. Shandor finally flipped one day after finding out the inbred farm boys who made his life hell most days were in fact his half-brothers. He returned home to confront his mother only to find her pritt-sticking press cuttings of the Mad Killer into a brand new scrapbook and seemingly not in the least bit concerned by her son's unexpected discovery. Luckily Shandor's shooting spree didn't do too much damage beyond putting one of his so-called new father's eyes out, which could be considered doubly unfortunate given as the so-called new father in question owned the old byre Shandor and his mother called home. After Shandor had spent enough time shut away in borstal with the kind of kids who would've sent his mother all weak at the knees, he went straight home half-expecting the byre to be boarded up with a blu-tacked note saying she was lugging her stupid arse to Texas to spring her latest psycho boyfriend from his cell on death row. Shandor was thinking how much that excuse would sit well with her as he scuffed up the stone track to the byre with a black bin-bag of belongings and a sunburned arm across his forehead to shield himself from the glare. The place looked pretty much the same as he remembered it, only three years worse off. The strip of grass outside the back door was parched yellow and paint peeled around the blown-out windows. He had a hand on the door before he knew for sure it was still lived-in. He flapped thunderbugs off his forearm and creaked open the door.

Kayla spent more on her new car.. [2]. Lindsey spent more on her new car..","output":"[2]. Lindsey spent more on her new car. Although both Kayla and Lindsey had their hearts set on purchasing new cars, their financial situations were vastly different. Kayla, a recent college graduate, had just started her professional journey in the marketing field. As an entry-level employee, her paycheck was not as substantial as that of Lindsey, who had laid the foundation of a successful career in finance years prior. Lindsey had steadily climbed the corporate ladder, earning multiple promotions and securing several high-profile clients. Her experience enabled her to negotiate a well-deserved salary which was significantly higher than that of Kayla. Thus, Lindsey could afford the luxury of splurging on the newest, high-end vehicles available in the market. Kayla, on the other hand, had to tread carefully when it came to spending on a new car. Saddled with student loans and adjusting to the reality of living on her own, Kayla couldn't let her dreams of driving a luxury car blind her to the financial responsibilities she had to prioritize. As such, she opted for a more modest and affordable car that would provide her with reliable transportation without breaking the bank. Meanwhile, Lindsey had her eyes set on a sleek, top-of-the-line car that matched her high-end lifestyle. After diligent research and multiple test drives, Lindsey decided on a gorgeous sports car with cutting-edge technology, impressive horsepower, and an eye-catching design. This car not only portrayed her success but also demonstrated her sharp taste in automobiles. With her larger budget, Lindsey was able to follow through with her purchase, ultimately spending significantly more than Kayla on a new car. Despite their spending disparity, both Kayla and Lindsey were content with their choices. While Kayla understood that she had to make certain sacrifices at the beginning of her career, she remained hopeful that with hard work and determination, she would eventually advance in her field and have the financial means to upgrade her vehicle in the future. In the meantime, she appreciated her dependable car and its fuel efficiency, which allowed her to save money and allocate her resources toward other essential expenses. Lindsey, on the other hand, was proud of her accomplishments and the position she had earned in her field. Her new car, a symbol of her hard work and ambition, inspired her to continue striving for professional growth and seizing every opportunity that came her way. In conclusion, while Kayla made much less money than Lindsey, it was Lindsey who spent more on her new car. Their contrasting financial situations resulted in different purchasing approaches, yet both women were content with their choices and remained optimistic about achieving their respective personal and professional aspirations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Whoever it was, somehow you have developed an understanding of what is rapidly becoming a truly global language. There are now about 376 million people who speak English as their first language, and about the same number who have learnt it in addition to their mother tongue. There are said to be one billion people learning English now and about 80% of the information on the Internet is in English. Is this a good thing, or a bad thing? Should we celebrate the fact that more and more of us can communicate, using a common language, across countries and cultures? Or should we worry about the dangers of \\" mono-culturalism\\", a world in which we all speak the same language, eat the same food and listen to the same music? Does it matter if an increasing number of people speak the same language? I would have thought the other way around  although I have never accepted the argument that if only we all understood each other better, there would be fewer wars. _ ... If we all speak English, will we then all start eating McDonalds burgers? Surely not. If English becomes more dominant , it will kill other languages? I doubt it.

Tried frying potatoes in it once but even after coating the bottom with a generous amount of olive oil, had a one inch layer of potatoes on the bottom which was very difficult to remove. I bought it mainly to brown meat, and maybe I shouldn't have attempted to fry potatoes in it, but I still have brown spots on the enamel from my first cooking expedition. Frying potatoes and browning meat, though, is a similar process so my impression is that this is a cheap dutch oven. My friend has a Le Crueset pot that this doesn't happen to. It's probably best for simmering stews and sauces, but I'd rather use my stainless steel pots which heat evenly, don't weigh 20 pounds, and are easy to clean. I should have returned this dutch oven but I was too lazy so now it sits on top of a cabinet in my kitchen taking up space (because it's so big and heavy, it's also a pain to store).

An International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) team spent three days in Tehran this week. Another meeting is planned for February 21-22. \\"The agency is committed to intensifying dialogue,\\" said Director General Yukiya Amano. \\"It remains essential to make progress on substantive issues.\\" The Iranian foreign minister called the talks \\"a positive forward step.\\" Ali Akbar Salehi told the semiofficial Fars News Agency that the IAEA \\"had some questions and we had very good meetings.\\" The team did not ask to inspect nuclear facilities, Salehi said. \\"If they wanted an inspection, we were prepared to comply with their request,\\" Salehi said. The six-member delegation -- including chief inspector Herman Nackaerts and second-in-command Rafael Grossi -- arrived in Tehran shortly after the European Union imposed new sanctions on Iran aimed at cutting off funding to the Islamic republic's nuclear program. Australia and the United States have also ramped up sanctions on Iran recently. Western powers believe Tehran is trying to develop nuclear weapons, an assertion Iran denies. Speaking Friday at the Davos Forum in Switzerland, Amano told reporters the visit was intended \\"to clarify the issues with possible military dimensions. \\"We are not very sure whether Iran has declared everything and, therefore, we are not very sure that everything stays in peaceful purpose,\\" he said. \\"In addition, we have information that Iran has engaged in activities related to the development of nuclear weapons. Therefore, we need to clarify.\\" Inspectors are in and out of the country regularly, an agency spokeswoman said Monday, but a high-level visit is more unusual. Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has said he is ready to discuss the program with a group of nations -- Great Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States -- that have held intermittent talks with Tehran. The energy agency reported in November that it can no longer verify that the Iranian nuclear program remains peaceful, and Iran is under increasing international pressure to halt its nuclear fuel work.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Use this fact to answer the question: landfills have a negative impact on the environment What have a negative impact on the environment?","output":"Landfills have a negative impact on the environment. A landfill is a designated area or site for the disposal of waste materials, typically originating from households, industries, and construction sites. These waste materials are often non-biodegradable or take a long time to break down, which contributes to a range of environmental concerns affecting the planet. The negative impacts of landfills on the environment can be broadly categorized into the following areas: 1. Air pollution: Landfills produce harmful gases, including methane and carbon dioxide, as waste materials decompose. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming, while carbon dioxide also exacerbates the greenhouse effect, leading to climate change. In addition, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are released from some waste materials, causing offensive odors and potentially contributing to the formation of ground-level ozone. 2. Soil contamination: Landfills can contaminate the soil in several ways. When rainwater filters through the waste materials, it forms a contaminated liquid known as leachate. This toxic liquid can seep into the soil and affect the chemical balance, potentially harming ecosystems and local plant life. Furthermore, some waste materials contain hazardous chemicals, heavy metals, and pathogens that can leach into the soil and pose a threat to human health and the environment. 3. Water pollution: Contaminated leachate from landfills can also pollute nearby rivers, lakes, and groundwater. This negatively impacts aquatic ecosystems, jeopardizing the survival of plants, fish, and other species. Moreover, water pollution can compromise the quality of drinking water in nearby communities, posing serious health risks to humans and wildlife. 4. Loss of biodiversity: As landfills often occupy vast areas of land, the construction and expansion of these sites lead to habitat destruction and fragmentation. This can, in turn, result in loss of biodiversity, endangering plant and animal species, and disrupting the balance of local ecosystems. 5. Increased carbon footprint: The transport and disposal of waste materials in landfills contribute to an increased carbon footprint, as fossil fuel-powered vehicles emit greenhouse gases when transporting waste to these sites. 6. Resource depletion: Landfills contribute to the squandering of valuable resources that could otherwise be reused, recycled, or repurposed. Disposing of waste in landfills instead of finding ways to recycle or reduce waste generation exacerbates resource scarcity. To mitigate these negative environmental impacts, communities should adopt sustainable waste management practices. These may include reducing waste generated at the source, promoting recycling and composting, utilizing alternative waste disposal technologies (such as waste-to-energy facilities), and implementing better landfill design and management techniques. By addressing these issues, it is possible to lessen the negative environmental consequences associated with landfills and secure a healthier future for our planet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Question: Many random citizens would use an entrance hall to enter this sort of building. What is it? Options: - school - public building - large building - auditorum - convention center  Explain why a human would choose \\"public building\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"The task here requires understanding of the question and the options provided to justify why a human would choose \\"public building\\". Step 1: Understanding the question The question is asking about a type of building where \\"many random citizens\\" would use an entrance hall to get inside. This implies it's a common place that accommodates a variety of people and not just a specific group. Step 2: Review the given options The options provided are: school, public building, large building, auditorium, and convention center. Step 3: Matching options with the question When we compare these options to the question, we find that while all these buildings could have an entrance hall, not all of them align with the phrase \\"many random citizens\\".  - A school is more specific and usually only students, teachers, and staff enter. - A large building could be of any sort, including private offices, which are not used by \\"random citizens\\". - An auditorium and convention center can be correct but these are used for specific events and not all \\"random citizens\\" can access it unless there's an event happening.   Step 4: Elimination and final selection Based on the above assessments, \\"public building\\" is the best fit as public buildings are designed for use by the public, i.e., many random citizens. Examples include libraries, hospitals, government buildings, etc. These places are openly accessible and are commonly used by a variety of people, justifying the phrase from the question.

WHITE HOUSE — The United States is escalating trans-Atlantic and North American trade tensions, imposing a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports from the European Union, Canada and Mexico beginning on Friday. The U.S. also negotiated quotas or volume limits on other countries, such as South Korea, Argentina, Australia and Brazil, instead of tariffs, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross also told reporters Thursday by telephone. China's foreign ministry said on Friday all countries should protect the normal trade order, when asked about U.S. decision. President Donald Trump said Thursday that the days of the U.S. being taken advantage of in trade deals \\"are over'\\" in a harshly worded statement responding to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's criticism of new steel and aluminum tariffs. He intensified his criticism of Canada Friday for what he says are the country's \\"highly restrictive\\" trade practices. Trump has repeatedly said measures such as tariffs are necessary to protect American jobs and industries in key manufacturing sectors. \\"The president's actions are about protecting American steel, American aluminum,\\" a White House spokesman, Raj Shah, said on Fox News. \\"They're critical for national security.\\" But the negative reaction from some of America's most important strategic allies has been quick and fierce. European Union Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said shortly after the tariffs took effect they were illegal and the 28-nation bloc would initiate a settlement dispute case with the World Trade Organization. \\"We can do so. We have the right to do so. I think we must do so, as well, to show that we cannot just take these tariffs and stand silent and we do not accept these kind of imposed illegal tariffs,\\" said Malmstrom. Without elaborating, Malmstrom also said the EU would explore \\"rebalancing measures,\\" which typically are retaliatory actions. Trudeau called the tariffs \\"totally unacceptable\\" and vowed retaliation. \\"This decision is not only unlawful, but it is... According to the above context, answer the following question. After the end of the story, Macron probably is Answer:","output":"Not specifically mentioned in the given text, French President Emmanuel Macron's probable stance after the end of the story can only be inferred. Based on the trend among leaders of other affected countries such as Canada and EU nations, Macron probably opposed the steel and aluminum tariffs imposed by the U.S.  Since the tariffs would likely adversely impact France as part of the European Union, it's plausible that he would echo sentiments similar to European Union Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom. He might consider the tariffs illegal and express intent to initiate a settlement dispute case with the World Trade Organization, just as Malmstrom did.  Additionally, given the EU's exploration of \\"rebalancing measures,\\" Macron may support or be involved in formulating retaliatory actions against the U.S. to balance out the perceived inequity created by the tariffs.  Finally, indirectly speculated upon the basis of President Trump's assertion that the tariffs are necessary to protect American industries, Macron might be concerned about the potential damaging implications for French industries as well as the broader global trade ecosystem.  In summary, Macron's probable reaction, based on the landscape sketched out in the given story and barring information to the contrary, would be one of opposition and possible pursuit of countermeasures. He would likely consult closely with EU partners to formulate an effective response. However, the precise nature of Macron's stance is not detailed in the provided text and these assumptions are made through logical reasoning and inference. We would need to refer to Macron's actual statements or further context to accurately detail his position."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The Agencies Confer When they learned a second plane had struck the World Trade Center, nearly everyone in the White House told us, they immediately knew it was not an accident. The Secret Service initiated a number of security enhancements around the White House complex. The officials who issued these orders did not know that there were additional hijacked aircraft, or that one such aircraft was en route to Washington. These measures were precautionary steps taken because of the strikes in New York. The FAA and White House Teleconferences. The FAA, the White House, and the Defense Department each initiated a multiagency teleconference before 9:30. Because none of these teleconferences-at least before 10:00- included the right officials from both the FAA and Defense Department, none succeeded in meaningfully coordinating the military and FAA response to the hijackings. At about 9:20, security personnel at FAA headquarters set up a hijacking teleconference with several agencies, including the Defense Department. The NMCC officer who participated told us that the call was monitored only periodically because the information was sporadic, it was of little value, and there were other important tasks. The FAA manager of the teleconference also remembered that the military participated only briefly before the Pentagon was hit. Both individuals agreed that the teleconference played no role in coordinating a response to the attacks of 9/11. Acting Deputy Administrator Belger was frustrated to learn later in the morning that the military had not been on the call. At the White House, the video teleconference was conducted from the Situation Room by Richard Clarke, a special assistant to the president long involved in counterterrorism. Logs indicate that it began at 9:25 and included the CIA; the FBI; the departments of State, Justice, and Defense; the FAA; and the White House shelter. The FAA and CIA joined at 9:40. The first topic addressed in the White House video teleconference-at about 9:40-was the physical security of the President, the White House, and federal agencies. Immediately thereafter it was reported that a plane had hit the Pentagon. We found no evidence that video teleconference participants had any prior information that American 77 had been hijacked and was heading directly toward Washington.

The agents said that she \\"admitted that her family belonged to al-Qaeda in Iraq\\" and that she took part in holding the women hostage on behalf of ISIS.      The agents said she told them that al-Baghdadi \\"owned\\" Mueller during the time of captivity at the Sayyaf home.      \\"The defendant admitted that 'owning' is equivalent to slavery,\\" prosecutors said.      Mueller and another person traveled into northern Syria on Aug. 3, 2013. On their second full day in the country, they were kidnapped by ISIS soldiers. ISIS leaders notified the Mueller family of her death in an e-mail Feb. 7, 2015. ||||| US federal prosecutors have filed charges against an Iraqi woman accused of holding American aid worker Kayla Mueller hostage before she was killed in Syria.      In an affidavit released on Monday, FBI special agent William Heaney charged 25-year-old Nisreen Assad Ibrahim Bahar, also known as Umm Sayyaf, with conspiring to provide material support to Islamic State – an offense that officials allege resulted in Mueller’s death in February 2014.      According to the affidavit, which revealed new details about Mueller’s time in captivity, the 26-year-old Arizona woman was abducted at gunpoint by masked Isis soldiers on her second day in Syria in August 2013 and was taken to prison with other hostages.            In September 2014, she was then transferred from the Isis prison to the custody of Sayyaf and her husband Abu Sayyaf, also known as Fathi ben Awn ben Jildi Murad al-Tunisi, who is believed to have been a mid-ranking Isis operative who reported directly to the Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.      The Sayyafs held Mueller and other female captives in several residences, handcuffing them and locking them in rooms, the charges reveal. According to the affidavit, Baghdadi abused and raped Mueller along with two other Yazidi women also held captive by the pair. Umm Sayyaf “knew how Mueller was treated by Baghdadi when Mueller was held against her will in Sayyaf’s home”, according to the Justice Department statement on Monday.      Umm Sayyaf “threatened the women, telling them she would kill them if they did not listen to her”, the statement continues. Sayyaf also “chastised the captives” by calling them “kafir” and “infidels”, according to the affidavit.      The affidavit further alleges that Sayyaf showed “violent ISIL propaganda videos” to Mueller and the other captives, and that young women held by Umm Sayyaf were sold and traded to Isis men.      Umm Sayyaf allegedly confessed that she had sole responsibility for Mueller and others while her husband traveled, according to the affidavit, in which she also admitted that Baghdadi “owned” Mueller during her captivity, with “owning” being equivalent to slavery.      Mueller had been working to provide support to Syrian refugees. Her death was announced in February 2015, but the circumstances of her death have never been verified by US officials. At the time, the terrorist group had claimed that Mueller was killed during a Jordanian air raid made in retaliation for Islamic State’s gruesome killing of a Jordanian pilot. The group subsequently sent photographs of the dead woman to her family in the US as proof, but her family has said it suspects that Mueller was murdered by Isis.      Umm Sayyaf was captured during the US military raid which killed her husband in May 2015, becoming the first detainee held by the US in its year-long war against Isis. The US military transferred her over to Iraqi Kurdish custody after nearly three months of holding her in low-profile captivity for interrogation.      In subsequent interviews with FBI agents, Umm Sayyaf admitted that her family had belonged to al-Qaida’s affiliate in Iraq prior to Isis’s formation, and were subsequently active members of Islamic State, the affidavit said.      The woman could face life in prison if convicted. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"A very bad woman named Umm Sayyaf is being accused of keeping a nice lady named Kayla Mueller as a prisoner.

Wave pools are often a major feature of water parks. Siam Park City Water Park in Thailand is home to the world's largest wave pool certified by Guinness World Records, and Siam Park (Tenerife) in Spain is home to the biggest man made waves (about 3 meters (9.8 ft)) in the world.  - A museum is an institution that cares for (conserves) a collection of artifacts and other objects of artistic, cultural, historical, or scientific importance and some public museums make them available for public viewing through exhibits that may be permanent or temporary. Most large museums are located in major cities throughout the world and more local ones exist in smaller cities, towns and even the countryside. Museums have varying aims, ranging from serving researchers and specialists to serving the general public. The goal of serving researchers is increasingly shifting to serving the general public.  - The American Museum of Natural History (abbreviated as AMNH), located on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, New York City, is one of the largest museums in the world. Located in park-like grounds across the street from Central Park, the museum complex comprises 28 interconnected buildings housing 45 permanent exhibition halls, in addition to a planetarium and a library. The museum collections contain over 33 million specimens of plants, animals, fossils, minerals, rocks, meteorites, human remains, and human cultural artifacts, of which only a small fraction can be displayed at any given time, and occupies more than . The museum has a full-time scientific staff of 225, sponsors over 120 special field expeditions each year, and averages about five million visits annually.  - The Upper West Side, sometimes abbreviated UWS, is a neighborhood in the borough of Manhattan, New York City, that lies between Central Park and the Hudson River and between West 59th Street and West 110th Street. The Upper West Side is sometimes also considered by the real estate industry to include the neighborhood of Morningside Heights.  - In physics, a standing wave  also known as a stationary wave  is a wave in a medium in which each point on the axis of the wave has an associated constant amplitude. The locations at which the amplitude is minimum are called nodes, and the locations where the amplitude is maximum are called antinodes.  - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land.  - The lion (\\"Panthera leo\\") is one of the big cats in the genus \\"Panthera\\" and a member of the family Felidae. The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males exceeding in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered.  - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States.

Christine had previously learned how to tie a necktie while helping her father get ready for formal events when she was younger. She felt confident in her ability to help Jessica master this skill on her first try. Step 1: Christine suggested that Jessica stand in front of a mirror while they practiced so she could see the process more clearly and make any needed adjustments. She also asked Jessica to grab a necktie and wear a collared shirt to get a more accurate result. Step 2: At the mirror, Christine instructed Jessica to flip up her collar and place the necktie around her neck, making sure that the wider end was on her right side and the narrow end on her left side. She explained that the wider end should be longer than the narrow end, as they would need the extra length for the knot. Step 3: Christine then guided Jessica through the process of tying a basic four-in-hand knot, which would be suitable for the wedding event. She told Jessica to cross the wide end of the tie over the narrow end, then to bring the wide end under the narrow end and pull it back up through the loop that was formed around her neck. Step 4: Next, Christine instructed Jessica to bring the wide end over the narrow end one more time, creating a second layer around the first knot. After this step, Jessica was advised to bring the wide end through the back of the loop and then carefully pass it through the newly created knot in the front. Step 5: Christine showed Jessica how to adjust and tighten the knot by pulling on the narrow end while holding the knot with her other hand. At the same time, she explained the importance of making sure the knot looked balanced and symmetrical. Step 6: Once the knot was secured, Christine helped Jessica to flip her collar back down and make any final alignment adjustments to ensure the tie was the proper length and centered on her shirt.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: Dan studied genetic engineering. He was applying his knowledge of genetic engineering to develop better crops. Recently, he had successfully developed a crop, crop A, that was herbicide tolerant. To determine the versatility of the crop he compared it with another crop that was not tolerant of herbicides, crop B. The results of his research would allow his company to market the new crop.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which crop would need more number of chemicals, crop A or crop B?  Hint: In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, crop A would need fewer chemicals compared to crop B. Crop A has been genetically engineered to be herbicide-tolerant, which allows it to grow and survive in the presence of herbicides that kill the surrounding weeds. This herbicide tolerance would not only improve weed management but also potentially reduce the number of chemicals needed during the growing season. On the other hand, crop B, which is not tolerant of herbicides, would require multiple applications of various herbicides as well as additional mechanical or hand weeding to effectively manage weeds. Consequently, crop B would require more chemicals than crop A."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

And the answer is...","output":"Alright, let's solve the problem step by step, like we are looking for how many candies w we need to have. The equation is: -43*w - 15*w - 1422 = 21*w Step 1: Combine the w terms on the left side. So, -43 candies - 15 candies makes it -58 candies: -58*w - 1422 = 21*w Step 2: Now, let's move the 21 candies on the right side to the left side. To do this, we subtract 21 candies from both sides of the equation: -58*w - 21*w - 1422 = 0 Now we have -79 candies: -79*w - 1422 = 0 Step 3: We want to find out how many candies w we need, so let's get rid of the 1422. To do that, we add 1422 to both sides of the equation: -79*w = 1422 Step 4: Finally, we want to know the number of candies w, so we need to divide 1422 by -79: w = 1422 / -79 Now, after dividing, we find that w equals -18. So, the answer is w = -18. It's like saying we need -18 candies, but since we can't have negative candies, it just means we are taking away 18 candies instead of adding them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sometimes we know what we are doing with the use of gestures such as the thumbs-up sign to indicate that we approve. But most of the time we are not aware that we are doing it.  Body language serves a variety of purpose. Firstly it can replace verbal communication, as with the use of gesture. Secondly, it can modify   verbal communication.

Now an American study has found that memory starts to fail when we are young adults. People younger than thirty years of age usually do not know that they are starting to forget information. But scientists from the University of Michigan say the loss of memory has usually already started. Researchers say people do not observe this slow reduction in mental ability until the loss affects their everyday activities. Denise Park led the new study. She directs the Centre for Aging and Cognition at the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan. Her team studied more than 350 men and women between the ages of twenty and ninety years. The study identified people in their middle twenties with memory problems. She says young adults do not know they are forgetting things because their brains have more information than they need. But she says that people in their twenties and thirties are losing memory at the same rate as people in their sixties and seventies. Ms. Park says people between the ages of sixty and seventy may note the decrease in their mental abilities. They begin to observe that they are having more trouble remembering and learning new information. The study found that older adults are more likely to remember false information as being true. For example, they remembered false medical claims as being true. Younger people remembered hearing the information. But they were more likely to remember that it was false. Ms. Park is now using modern imaging equipment to study what happens in the brains of people of different ages. She is studying what parts of the brain older adults use for different activities compared to younger adults. Ms. Park says mental performance is a direct result of brain activity and brain structure. She says keeping the brain active is important. She hopes future studies will identify ways to improve the operation of our aging minds. Question: Which of the following is a suitable title for the passage?

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Please answer the following question: Information:  - Costume is the distinctive style of dress of an individual or group that reflects their class, gender, profession, ethnicity, nationality, activity or epoch.  - Filmmaking (or in an academic context, film production) is the process of making a film. Filmmaking involves a number of discrete stages including an initial story, idea, or commission, through screenwriting, casting, shooting, sound recording and reproduction, editing, and screening the finished product before an audience that may result in a film release and exhibition. Filmmaking takes place in many places around the world in a range of economic, social, and political contexts, and using a variety of technologies and cinematic techniques. Typically, it involves a large number of people, and can take from a few months to several years to complete.  - Epic film is a style of filmmaking with large scale, sweeping scope, and spectacle. The usage of the term has shifted over time, sometimes designating a film genre and at other times simply synonymous with big budget filmmaking. Like epics in the classical literary sense it is often focused on a heroic character. An epic's ambitious nature helps to set it apart from other types of film such as the period piece or adventure film. Epic historical films would usually take a historical or a mythic event and add an extravagant setting and lavish costumes, accompanied by an expansive musical score with an ensemble cast, which would make them among the most expensive of films to produce. The most common subjects of epic films are royalty, and important figures from various periods in world history.  - An audience is a group of people who participate in a show or encounter a work of art, literature (in which they are called \\"readers\\"), theatre, music (in which they are called \\"listeners\\"), video games (in which they are called \\"players\\"), or academics in any medium. Audience members participate in different ways in different kinds of art; some events invite overt audience participation and others allowing only modest clapping and criticism and reception.  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - Computer animation is the process used for generating animated images. The more general term computer-generated imagery (CGI) encompasses both static scenes and dynamic images, while computer animation \\"only\\" refers to the moving images. Modern computer animation usually uses 3D computer graphics, although 2D computer graphics are still used for stylistic, low bandwidth, and faster real-time renderings. Sometimes, the target of the animation is the computer itself, but sometimes film as well.  - The phi phenomenon is the optical illusion of perceiving a series of still images, when viewed in rapid succession, as continuous motion. Max Wertheimer, one of the three founders of Gestalt psychology, defined this phenomenon in 1912. The phi phenomenon and persistence of vision together formed the foundation of Hugo Münsterberg's theory of film and are part of the process of motion perception.  - Grand opera is a genre of 19th-century opera generally in four or five acts, characterized by large-scale casts and orchestras, and (in their original productions) lavish and spectacular design and stage effects, normally with plots based on or around dramatic historic events. The term is particularly applied (sometimes specifically using in its French language equivalent grand opéra) to certain productions of the Paris Opéra from the late 1820s to around 1850; 'grand opéra' has sometimes been used to denote the Paris Opéra itself.  - Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor.  - A background actor or extra is a performer in a film , television show , stage , musical , opera or ballet production , who appears in a nonspeaking or nonsinging ( silent ) capacity , usually in the background ( for example , in an audience or busy street scene ) . War films and epic films often employ background actors in large numbers : some films have featured hundreds or even thousands of paid background actors as cast members ( hence the term ' cast of thousands ' ) . Likewise , grand opera can involve many background actors appearing in spectacular productions . On a film or TV set , background actors are usually referred to as \`\` background talent '' , \`\` background performers '' , \`\` background artists '' , \`\` background cast members '' or simply \`\` background '' while the term \`\` extra '' is rarely used . In a stage production , background actors are commonly referred to as \`\` supernumeraries '' . In opera and ballet , they are called either \`\` extras '' or \`\` supers '' .  - Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art.  - Animation is the process of making the illusion of motion and the illusion of change by means of the rapid display of a sequence of images that minimally differ from each other. The illusionas in motion pictures in generalis thought to rely on the phi phenomenon. Animators are artists who specialize in the creation of animation. Animation can be recorded with either analogue media, a flip book, motion picture film, video tape, digital media, including formats with animated GIF, Flash animation, and digital video. To display animation, a digital camera, computer, or projector are used along with new technologies that are produced.  - In filmmaking, visual effects (abbreviated VFX) are the processes by which imagery is created and/or manipulated outside the context of a live action shot.     After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'extra ' with the relationship of 'instance of'.

Question: -  The lungs have a series of smaller and finer tubes and sacs - Air reaches the smallest and finest air sacs called alveoli - Oxygen travels from the alveoli into the blood - Oxygen-rich blood is carried to the heart - Oxygen-rich blood is pumped throughout the body by the heart - Cells take in the oxygen rich blood and release carbon dioxide rich blood - The carbon dioxide rich blood travels to the lungs - Carbon dioxide travels through the throat and is exhaled.  What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process is the inhalation of air through the nostrils and mouth. When we breathe in, air enters the body and is filtered, warmed, and humidified in the nasal cavity. It then passes through the pharynx (throat), which is a common passageway for both air and food, and moves into the larynx, also known as the voice box. The larynx contains the vocal cords and acts as a gatekeeper, preventing food particles from entering the respiratory system. During inhalation, the epiglottis, a flap-like structure, opens to allow air into the trachea, or windpipe. The trachea is a flexible tube that carries air from the larynx to the bronchi, the two main airways that lead to the lungs. Once inside the lungs, the bronchi branch into smaller and finer tubes called bronchioles. These bronchioles create an intricate network within the lungs, resembling a tree with multiple branches and twigs. At the end of these bronchioles, the smallest and finest air sacs, called alveoli, can be found. It is within these alveoli that the essential gas exchange between the respiratory and circulatory systems occurs. Oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses across the thin walls of the alveoli into the surrounding capillaries, which are tiny blood vessels. Simultaneously, carbon dioxide, a waste product produced by our cells during various metabolic processes, diffuses from the blood in the capillaries into the alveoli. Upon receiving oxygen, the blood becomes oxygen-rich and is carried by the pulmonary veins to the heart, specifically to the left atrium. It then flows into the left ventricle and is pumped throughout the body via the aorta and other arteries. As the oxygen-rich blood reaches the body's cells, oxygen is taken in and utilized, while carbon dioxide-rich blood is released as a waste product. The carbon dioxide-rich blood then travels back to the heart, enters the right atrium, and moves into the right ventricle. From there, it is pumped through the pulmonary arteries to the lungs, where the carbon dioxide is removed from the blood and expelled from the body. This process of exhalation involves the carbon dioxide passing through the alveoli, bronchioles, bronchi, trachea, larynx, pharynx, and ultimately out through the mouth and nostrils. In summary, the first step of the respiratory process involves the inhalation of air through the mouth and nostrils, passing through various structures such as the nasal cavity, pharynx, larynx, trachea, and bronchi, before reaching the alveoli in the lungs for gas exchange to occur."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it.

Controlled Drinking Zones (CDZ): In some locations, local authorities have designated Controlled Drinking Zones, where you may be asked to stop consuming alcohol or hand over your alcoholic drinks by a police officer or authorized personnel. 2. Public Spaces Protection Orders (PSPOs): Local authorities can also impose Public Spaces Protection Orders, which are intended to regulate specific activities in certain areas, including restrictions on alcohol consumption. 3. Other local bylaws and restrictions: Some parks and public areas in the UK may have their own specific bylaws and regulations concerning the consumption of alcohol.

When studying the kinetic-molecular theory, two teams of students did and experiment. Team A heated a can of soup over the fire without venting it first, team B heated a can of soup, but vented it first.  Hint: It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can. A:","output":"Team A led a less safer experiment. In the given paragraph, it is explained that Team A heated a can of soup over the fire without venting it first, whereas Team B heated a can of soup but vented it first. The hint provided states that it is very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can, as this could lead to an explosion due to the increase in kinetic energy and pressure within the can. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why this situation is dangerous. When the rigid can of soup is heated over a campfire without venting, the air inside the can is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. This causes the air molecules to move faster and collide with the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside the can may eventually exceed the strength of the can itself, which may result in an explosion. Additionally, as the soup begins boiling, it will produce more gas and create even more pressure within the can.  On the other hand, Team B vented the can before heating it, which allowed the pressure inside the can to be released, preventing the build-up of pressure within the can and reducing the risk of an explosion.

Jed is heavyset, and Tyler is thin. During the race, who will speed up fastest? (A) Jed (B) Tyler A:","output":"B) Tyler When comparing a heavyset individual (Jed) to a thin individual (Tyler) in a race, it's important to take several factors into consideration to determine who will speed up the fastest. These factors include muscle mass, agility, body composition, and cardiovascular fitness. Based on the given information, we can infer the following: 1. Muscle Mass: A heavyset person like Jed may have more muscle mass than a thin person like Tyler. While this could provide a greater force for propelling Jed forward, it also means that Jed's body will require more energy and effort to accelerate compared to Tyler. 2. Body Composition: A heavyset individual typically has a larger percentage of body fat compared to a thin individual. Carrying excess body fat can slow a person down, as it requires more energy to move additional weight. As a result, Tyler may be quicker to speed up due to his lighter body composition. 3. Agility: Agility refers to a person's ability to quickly change direction or speed. Generally, thinner individuals like Tyler have a greater level of agility compared to heavyset individuals. This is because they have less body mass to move around, making it easier to change direction or increase speed. 4. Cardiovascular Fitness: In order to run faster, an individual needs to have good cardiovascular fitness. Generally speaking, thin individuals are more likely to have better cardiovascular fitness compared to heavyset counterparts, simply due to the fact that they have less body mass to carry around in everyday life. This may give Tyler an edge in his ability to speed up during the race. Based on these factors, it's reasonable to conclude that Tyler, the thinner individual, would likely speed up faster than Jed, the heavyset individual. However, it's important to note that many other factors, such as training status and overall fitness level, can also play a significant role in determining individual racing performance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Is \\"Regulation of hunting within the United States dates from the 19th century.\\" a good answer to the question \\"What century is U.S. regulations dates from?\\"","output":"Yes, the statement \\"Regulation of hunting within the United States dates from the 19th century\\" is an accurate and adequate response to the question \\"What century is U.S. regulations dates from?\\" However, for a more detailed and informative answer, consider the following: The regulation of hunting in the United States has a long and complex history, with its roots dating back to the 19th century. Prior to the 19th century, hunting was generally considered a common right, with few restrictions or conservation measures in place. However, as the United States underwent rapid industrialization and westward expansion, many species of wildlife faced significant declines due to habitat destruction, overhunting, and market hunting. The recognition of these issues and the desire to conserve and manage game species for present and future generations led to the creation of hunting regulations within the United States in the 19th century. The Lacey Act, passed in 1900, was the first major federal conservation law, prohibiting interstate transport of game killed in violation of state laws and protecting wildlife from market hunting and other unsustainable practices.  Additionally, state-level regulations began to emerge during the latter half of the 19th century. For example, the New York State Game Law in 1873 established a first step towards the creation of a conservation agency responsible for wildlife management and enforcement of hunting and fishing regulations. States across the country implemented various forms of hunting rules and procedures, from setting seasons and licensing requirements to establishing game wardens to enforce the new laws. Furthermore, the passage of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act in 1918 marked the foundation of federal regulation of migratory birds, including ducks, geese, and songbirds. The act was a response to the drastic declines in bird populations caused by unregulated hunting and the millinery trade, which used bird feathers for fashion purposes. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act provided the foundation for modern-day waterfowl hunting regulations and has had a significant impact on the conservation of many migratory bird species. In conclusion, the origins of hunting regulations in the United States can be traced back to the 19th century when societal, environmental, and conservation concerns called for the implementation of laws to protect wildlife and ensure sustainable hunting practices. These early regulations set the groundwork for the more advanced, science-based wildlife management strategies that guide U.S. hunting regulations today. So, while the simple statement that hunting regulations date from the 19th century is accurate, it's important to recognize that the story is much richer and more nuanced, reflecting the evolving relationship between people and wildlife in the United States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Fiona Elizabeth Bruce (born 25 April 1964) is a British television journalist, newsreader and television presenter. Since joining the BBC as a researcher on Panorama in 1989, she has gone on to present many flagship programmes for the corporation including the \\"BBC News at Six\\", \\"BBC News at Ten\\", \\"Crimewatch\\", \\"Antiques Roadshow\\" and, most recently, \\"Fake or Fortune\\".  - Crimewatch (formerly Crimewatch UK) is a long-running and high-profile British television programme produced by the BBC, that reconstructs major unsolved crimes in order to gain information from the public which may assist in solving the case. The programme was originally broadcast once a month on BBC One, although in more recent years it has more usually been broadcast roughly once every two months. It was announced on 15 October 2008 that the BBC would move the production of shows such as \\"Crimewatch\\" to studios in Cardiff.  - A TV format is the overall concept and branding of a copyrighted television program. The most common type of formats are those in the television genres of game shows and reality shows, many of which are remade in multiple markets with local contestants. Recent examples include \\"Survivor\\", \\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\\", \\"Pop Idol\\" and \\"Big Brother\\" that have all proved successful worldwide.  - Antiques Roadshow is a British television show in which antiques appraisers travel to various regions of the United Kingdom ( and occasionally in other countries ) to appraise antiques brought in by local people . It has been running since 1979 , based on a 1977 documentary series . The series has spawned international versions with the same TV format , including Canada and the United States . As of 2016 it is presented by Fiona Bruce and is in its 38th series .  - The BBC News at Six is the evening news programme broadcast each night on British television channel BBC One and the BBC News channel at 18:00. For a long period the \\"News at Six\\" was the most watched news programme in the UK but since 2006 it has been over taken by the \\"BBC News at Ten\\". On average it pulls in 4 million viewers.  - The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is a British public service broadcaster. It is headquartered at Broadcasting House in London, is the world's oldest national broadcasting organisation, and is the largest broadcaster in the world by number of employees, with over 20,950 staff in total, of whom 16,672 are in public sector broadcasting; including part-time, flexible as well as fixed contract staff, the total number is 35,402.  - A game show is a type of radio, television, or internet programming genre in which contestants, television personalities or celebrities, sometimes as part of a team, play a game which involves answering questions or solving puzzles usually for money and/or prizes. Alternatively, a \\"gameshow\\" can be a demonstrative program about a game (while usually retaining the spirit of an awards ceremony). In the former, contestants may be invited from a pool of public applicants. On some shows, contestants compete against other players or another team, while other shows involve contestants playing alone for a reward or a high score. Game shows often reward players with prizes such as cash, trips and goods and services provided by the show's sponsor prize suppliers, who in turn usually do so for the purposes of product placement. One of the reasons that television broadcasters make game shows is because they are substantially less costly than producing scripted drama shows. Some TV game shows fall under the category of reality television.  - Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (sometimes informally known as Millionaire) is an international television game show franchise of British origin, created by David Briggs, Mike Whitehill and Steven Knight. In its format, currently owned and licensed by Sony Pictures Television, large cash prizes are offered for correctly answering a series of multiple-choice questions of increasing (or, in some cases, random) difficulty. The maximum cash prize (in the original British version) was one million pounds. Most international versions offer a top prize of one million units of the local currency; the actual value of the prize varies widely, depending on the value of the currency.  - Pop Idol is a British television music competition created by Simon Fuller which ran on ITV from 2001 to 2003. The aim of the show was to decide the best new young pop singer (or \\"pop idol\\") in the UK based on viewer voting and participation. Two series were broadcastone in 20012002 and a second in 2003. \\"Pop Idol\\" was subsequently put on an indefinite hiatus after series judge Simon Cowell announced the launch of \\"The X Factor\\" in the UK in April 2004.  - The BBC News at Ten also known as the BBC Ten O'Clock News or the Ten O'Clock News is the flagship evening news programme for British television channel BBC One and the BBC News channel. It is presented by Huw Edwards, and deputised by Fiona Bruce. It is the final comprehensive news programme of the day on BBC One.

Answer the following question: Left unfettered  , Anthony Konieczka, 9 years old, would happily play his Game Boy Advance or PlayStation 2 from the minute he gets up to the moment he goes to bed, 14 bleary-eyed   hours later. Anthony's box is stocked with traditional toys--board games, puzzles, art supplies--and as far as he is concerned, they are relics of Christmases past. His sister Michaely, 6 years old, still likes dressing her Barbies. But once she starts playing Game Boy, it's hard to get her away. Play patterns like this could take up another Christmas for the toy department. Through September, toy sales were down 5% compared with the first nine months of last year, according to the NDP Group. Meanwhile, the video-game industry is heading for another record year. Thanks to hot new games like Halo 2 for the Xbox, the industry is light-years ahead of the toy business when it comes out. While some new toys emerge every holiday season, toymakers are heading into this one without a monster hit  . Indeed, there has not been a Furby-style frenzy   in years. Of 10 toy segments only two, arts and crafts and dolls, have generated sales growth over a recent 12-month period. Some of the weakest categories like construction sets and action figures are the ones aimed at boys, who suffer the most from the video games. Analysts expect one of the top stocking stuffers this season to be not a traditional toy but the new generation of Nintendo's Game Boy, the DS, which hit stores last week. The deeper issue is that shifts in play patterns are forcing toymakers to fight for shelf space in a tightening market. Boys in particular seem to be abandoning traditional toys at earlier ages in favor of consumer electronics, video games, PC software and the Internet. The fact that kids are growing more tech-savvy  , a trend called \\"age compression  \\", has troubled toy companies for at least a decade. Action figures, for instance, used to be considered healthy for boys up to age 12. Now the items are mainly marketed to boys 4 to 6. A recent study found that...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The Glory of Melaka: In the early days, if you were not a pirate or a mosquito, Melaka was not much of a place to live. The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456.  Question: \\"Why did Parameswara take money to Beijing in 1411?\\" Answer: \\"To become a vessel king\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"Yes, the answer is correct. Parameswara took money to Beijing in 1411 because the Chinese emperor offered him protection and made him a vassal king in exchange for the financial tribute and port facilities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is \\"This term has gradually fallen out of favor because in some parts of the world the Chalcolithic and Neolithic are coterminous at both ends.\\" a good answer to the question \\"What are the first datings of Bronze artifacts from the Vinca culture?\\"","output":"While the statement provided does give context to the complexities of understanding early metalworking cultures and their transition from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age, it does not specifically address the first datings of bronze artifacts from the Vinca culture. A more appropriate and detailed answer to the question would be: The Vinca culture, also known as the Turdaș-Vinča culture or Vinča-Turdaș culture, was a Neolithic and early Chalcolithic civilization that occupied present-day Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria, and Macedonia during the period from approximately 5700 - 4500 BCE. This culture was largely characterized by its sophisticated pottery and widespread metallurgical activities. Regarding the first datings of bronze artifacts from the Vinca culture, it is important to note that bronze as an alloy was not present or used in the Vinca culture as it was predated by a few millennia. The Vinca culture belongs to the Copper Age or the Chalcolithic period, where copper was the primary metal being used. It is in the subsequent Bronze Age that the utilization of bronze (an alloy of copper and tin) became widespread. Although the Vinca culture predominantly used copper for producing artifacts such as tools, ornaments, and figurines, the identification of specific datings for these artifacts is not a straightforward process. This is due to several factors, including variations in the chronology and development of the culture in diverse regions, as well as archaeological research inconsistencies. One of the earliest datings for copper artifacts from the Vinca culture can be traced back to settlements in the Balkans, such as the site at Pločnik, Serbia. Here, copper axes, hammers, and chisels, along with clay kilns, molds, crucibles, and slag, were discovered, establishing that the Vinca inhabitants were experimenting with copper metalworking as early as around 5000 BCE. It is important to note that these copper artifacts predate the widespread use of bronze. In conclusion, it is crucial to understand that the question seeks information about bronze artifacts from the Vinca culture; however, the Vinca culture precedes the Bronze Age and primarily dealt with copper metalworking. Therefore, it would be more accurate to focus on the datings and developments regarding copper artifacts within the Vinca culture instead of exploring any potential existence of bronze artifacts. One such example is the early technology in metalworking that has been identified in settlements like Pločnik, Serbia, dating back to around 5000 BCE."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

That's what will happen to many of the vacation days workers don't use by December 31. Americans are expected to subject two days to this unfortunate fate in 2012, according to a study released Thursday. What's more, that sacrifice comes from a smaller overall pool of days. In 2012, Americans reported receiving 12 days of vacation, compared with 14 days last year. Of those 12, they're expected to take only 10 this year, according to Expedia's annual Vacation Deprivation study. Even so, American workers still take more vacation than their Asian counterparts, the study shows. The Japanese are expected to take only five of 13 allotted days. South Koreans will likely take seven out of 10. Asian workers also work the longest weeks, about 44 hours, according to the study. Average Americans work a 40-hour week, the most common, while the Dutch have the lightest work week of the 22 nations surveyed, putting in just 35 hours. 5 cheaper times to travel. The survey was conducted online by Harris Interactive and included responses from 8,687 employed adults in 22 countries. Europeans are still the champions of making the most out of a relative boatload of vacation -- typically 25 to 30 days off in addition to holidays. In France and Spain, workers tend to take the full 30 days, while Germans take 28 of their 30 days. British, Swedish and Norwegian workers don't waste a single day, taking all 25 of their vacation days. \\"Studies consistently show that an ideal work-life balance leads to happier and more productive employees,\\" John Morrey, general manager of Expedia.com, said in a statement. \\"Your vacation days are not a gift, not a luxury. They're yours to use.\\" Overall, workers cited difficulty coordinating time off with family and friends and the possibility of rolling the days over into the next year as the biggest reasons they don't take their days. Workers in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Japan and Ireland cited money concerns as the biggest hurdle to taking their vacation time. Bosses in Norway, Sweden and Brazil are the most supportive of employees taking vacation time, the survey said, while more than half of bosses in Italy and South Korea were not so keen on the idea of workers getting away. 7 breathtaking clifftop hotels. Beach vacations ranked as the most popular escape, with 35 percent of respondents flocking to the water. So head to the shore, or lounge around in your living room.

Many Americans don't use all of their vacation days, with the expectation that two days will go unused in 2012, according to a study released by Expedia.     2. The study also shows that the overall pool of vacation days for Americans has reduced from 14 days last year to 12 days in 2012. Of these 12, it's expected that only 10 will be utilized. 3. Compared with American workers, Asian workers take fewer vacation days and work longer hours. For instance, Japanese workers are expected to take only five out of 13 allotted days, while South Koreans are likely to take seven out of 10.  4. Americans work an average 40-hour week, while Asian workers clock about 44 hours per week. 5. The Dutch have the lightest work week of the 22 nations surveyed, putting in just 35 hours. 6.

Answer the following question: author of one flew over the cukoos nest?","output":"The author of \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" is Ken Kesey. Born on September 17, 1935, in La Junta, Colorado, Ken Kesey was an influential American novelist and countercultural figure. He grew up in Oregon and attended the University of Oregon, where he received a bachelor's degree in speech and communication. Later, he was awarded a Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship to attend Stanford University's creative writing program. Kesey's most famous novel, \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\\" was published in 1962. The novel critiqued the oppressive nature of institutions, particularly within the mental health care system of the time. Set in an Oregon psychiatric hospital, the book explores themes of individualism, power dynamics, and societal norms through the interactions between the main character, Randle Patrick McMurphy, and the staff of the hospital. The novel is narrated by a patient named Chief Bromden, who adds a unique perspective on the events that unfold. \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" quickly gained popularity and became a staple of 1960s countercultural literature, representing a backlash against conformity and conventional views of mental illness. Kesey's portrayal of the abuse of power within the psychiatric system fueled discussions around psychiatric patients' rights and mental health care reform. The book was later adapted into a successful stage play in 1963 by Dale Wasserman, and a critically acclaimed film in 1975, directed by Miloš Forman. The film adaptation starred Jack Nicholson as McMurphy and Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched, the authoritarian head nurse. The movie received several Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Jack Nicholson), Best Actress (Louise Fletcher), and Best Adapted Screenplay. Kesey also authored other novels, such as \\"Sometimes a Great Notion\\" (1964), \\"Kesey's Garage Sale\\" (1973), and \\"Sailor Song\\" (1992). Additionally, he was involved in the countercultural movement through his group, the Merry Pranksters, which participated in a famous cross-country road trip in a bus called \\"Further.\\" This trip and Kesey's experiences with the Merry Pranksters were captured in Tom Wolfe's book, \\"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test\\" (1968). Ken Kesey passed away on November 10, 2001, in Eugene, Oregon, leaving behind a legacy of countercultural literature and advocacy for mental health care reform. His works continue to be widely studied and appreciated for their evocative portrayal of society’s constraints and the human spirit's potential for rebellion and transcendence."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In most plants, there are two types of vascular tissue that help them grow big and strong. These special tissues are called xylem and phloem. Xylem is like a straw that sucks up water and nutrients from the roots of the plant and sends them to the leaves so they can grow. It also helps the plant to stand tall. Phloem, on the other hand, works like a food delivery system. It takes the sugars, which are yummy plant food, made in the leaves and carries them to other parts of the plant that need the energy to grow. So, xylem and phloem are the super-important helpers that make sure plants get the water, nutrients, and food they need!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that increased environmental pollution may affect male and female birds mating. This could have direct and indirect effects on the process. Direct effects of increased pollution on bird mating: Environmental pollution can cause habitat degradation, making it difficult for birds to find suitable locations to mate. Pollution can also lead to contamination of food sources, which may weaken the health of birds and make them less able to mate successfully. Additionally, exposure to pollutants can cause developmental or physiological problems in birds, potentially affecting their ability to reproduce. Indirect effects of increased pollution on bird mating: Pollution can also have indirect effects on bird populations by affecting their food sources, changing the balance of predator-prey relationships, and causing shifts in their natural range due to changes in the ecosystem. These indirect effects can influence the mating process by impacting the availability of suitable mates, altering reproductive behaviors, and affecting the overall mating success of bird populations. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that increased environmental pollution can have both direct and indirect effects on male and female birds mating. These effects may result in changes to the reproductive success and population dynamics of bird species, potentially leading to declines in bird populations and disruptions to the ecosystem."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

John William Carson (October 23, 1925 - January 23, 2005) was an American television host, comedian, writer, and producer. He is best known as the host of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962-1992). Carson received six Emmy Awards, the Television Academy's 1980 Governor's Award, and a 1985 Peabody Award. He was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame in 1987. On May 1, 1972, the show was moved from Thirty Rockefeller Plaza, New York, to Burbank, California, because of the studio's proximity to the celebrities. Carson often joked about \\"beautiful downtown Burbank\\" and referred to \\"beautiful downtown Bakersfield\\", which prompted Bakersfield Mayor Mary K. Shell to chide Carson and invite him to her city to see improvements made during the early 1980s.  From July 1971, Carson stopped hosting five shows per week. Instead, Mondays featured a guest host, leaving Carson to host the other four weeknights. Shows were videotaped in Burbank at 5:30 pm, fed from there to the Central and Eastern time zone stations via cross-country television line at 8:30 pm Pacific time (11:30 pm Eastern time), and later sent from Burbank to the Pacific time zone stations at 11:30 pm Pacific time. Since only two feeds originated from Burbank, Central time zone stations received the Eastern feed one hour earlier at 10:30 pm local time, and Mountain time stations received the Pacific time zone feed one hour later at 12:30 am local time.  In 1980, at Carson's request, the show cut its 90-minute format to 60 minutes on September 16; Tom Snyder's Tomorrow added a half-hour to fill the vacant time. Joan Rivers became the \\"permanent\\" guest host from September 1983 until 1986. The Tonight Show returned to using rotating guest hosts, including comic George Carlin. Jay Leno then became the exclusive guest host in fall 1987. Leno joked that although other guest hosts had upped their fees, he had kept his low, assuring himself more bookings. Eventually, Monday night was for Leno, Tuesday for The Best of Carson--rebroadcasts usually dating from a year earlier, but occasionally from the 1970s.  Although Carson's work schedule became more attenuated, Tonight remained so successful that his compensation from NBC continued to rise; by the mid-1970s, he had become the highest-paid personality on television, earning about 4 million a year (15,008,000 today), not including nightclub appearances and his other businesses. He refused many offers to appear in films, including title roles in The Thomas Crown Affair and Gene Wilder's role in Blazing Saddles. He also declined director Martin Scorsese's offer to co-star with Robert De Niro in the 1983 film The King of Comedy, the role of a TV talk-show host then going to Jerry Lewis.  In recognition of his 25th anniversary on The Tonight Show, Carson received a personal Peabody Award, the board saying he had \\"become an American institution, a household word, [and] the most widely quoted American.\\" They also said they \\"felt the time had come to recognize the contributions that Johnny has made to television, to humor, and to America.\\" Entity:","output":"The entity this text is about is John William Carson, also known as Johnny Carson."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

CNN reports some people experienced a burning sensation in their hands and face and one person had a nose bleed. Leah Rubalcaba says 11 people were initially assessed, and three were transported for medical care.

The Marine Corps says the building was evacuated, and several Marines are receiving medical care. Expand this summary.","output":"Three individuals at a northern Virginia military base, Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall, have been transported to a medical facility and are currently in stable condition after an incident involving a suspicious piece of mail. Upon opening the mail, almost a dozen individuals experienced health issues, prompting immediate medical attention and further investigation. The Associated Press reported this incident as officials look to determine the cause of the sudden ailments. Located on the Marine Corps side of Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall, the incident took place in an office where the mail was received. According to a base spokeswoman, Leah Rubalcaba, those who came into contact with the mail immediately started feeling unwell, with symptoms including sore throats, a burning sensation in their hands and faces, and, in one case, a nosebleed. A total of 11 individuals were initially assessed, and three of them were transported to a medical facility for further treatment. In a statement released on Twitter, the Arlington County Fire Department confirmed the stable condition of the three individuals receiving medical care and mentioned that the investigation is still ongoing. The Marine Corps also stated that the building had been evacuated, ensuring the safety of the personnel inside, while several Marines were also receiving proper medical care. Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall, a military base with a rich history and importance in national security, plays a vital role for the United States. With this suspicious event occurring within their premises, it's crucial for authorities to determine the cause quickly and take necessary measures to protect the personnel working at the base. As the authorities continue to investigate the incident, it's crucial to determine whether this was an isolated occurrence or part of a broader scheme targeted at military bases. Security protocols will likely be updated and reinforced to ensure that situations like this do not happen again, and that the personnel at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall and other military installations across the nation are safe. While the three individuals who were significantly affected by the suspicious piece of mail are now receiving adequate medical care and in stable condition, it's important to monitor their progress and ensure they receive continued support throughout their recovery process. In conclusion, the suspicious mail incident at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall has raised concerns for the safety and well-being of military personnel. This event highlights the importance of strict security measures to protect individuals working at military installations and conducting vital tasks for the nation. As the investigation proceeds, it's crucial for military bases to remain vigilant and prepared for any potential threats, while ensuring the health and safety of all personnel."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"To provide a detailed and long answer, let us first analyze both sentences. Sentence 1: Means the Sather Karf must believe we killed you--he must have the report by now. This sentence suggests that Sather Karf has received the report and, assuming that the contents of the report indicate that the individual in question has been killed, he believes that the person has been killed. Sentence 2: He must have the report by now--means Sather Karf must believe we killed you This sentence establishes a cause-and-effect relationship. It states that if Sather Karf has received the report, then he must believe that the person has been killed. Now, let's examine the possible answers and evaluate if the second sentence is entailed by the first one. [i] Yes. This answer would imply that the second sentence is a direct result or consequence of the first sentence. Looking at the sentences' structure and meaning, we can see that there is a cause-and-effect relationship as mentioned earlier. If Sather Karf has the report, which is established in the first sentence, then he must believe that the person was killed, as described in the second sentence. Therefore, it can be argued that the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. [ii] It is not possible to tell. This answer would suggest that there is not enough information available to determine whether the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. However, given the context and the cause-and-effect relationship mentioned earlier, there seems to be sufficient information to establish that the second sentence is, indeed, entailed by the first sentence. [iii] No. This answer would imply that the second sentence is not a consequence or direct result of the first sentence. However, as mentioned earlier, there is a clear cause-and-effect relationship between the two sentences, suggesting that the second sentence is entailed by the first one. In conclusion, based on the analysis of both sentences and the established cause-and-effect relationship between them, the correct answer is [i] yes. The second sentence, \\"He must have the report by now--means Sather Karf must believe we killed you,\\" is indeed entailed by the first sentence, \\"Means the Sather Karf must believe we killed you--he must have the report by now.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- A man who has been fighting for permanent custody of his daughter under Native American tribal law can continue to raise her for the moment in Oklahoma, a new twist in a high-profile legal case already decided by the Supreme Court. The Oklahoma Supreme Court issued an emergency stay on Friday to temporarily delay the transfer of Dusten Brown's daughter, Veronica, 4, to her adoptive parents in South Carolina. The order was made public on Tuesday. Attorneys for Brown and the adoptive couple, Matt and Melanie Capobianco of North Charleston, planned to attend a closed-door hearing at the Oklahoma Supreme Court later on Tuesday. The case raises issues about the scope of a special federal law aimed at keeping","output":"Native American children with Native American families. The Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) was passed in 1978 in response to the high number of Native American children being removed from their homes and placed with non-Native American families. Brown, who is a member of the Cherokee Nation, has been arguing that the ICWA should apply in this case, allowing him to maintain custody over his daughter. After months of legal proceedings, the Oklahoma Supreme Court carefully considered the merits of the case and gathered input from various stakeholders, including the Cherokee Nation, the child's birth mother, and the adoptive parents. In order to fully comprehend the impact of the ICWA on this case, the court examined multiple factors, including the best interests of the child, the cultural connection of the child to the tribe, and the preservation of Native American families. In a landmark decision for Native American rights and family law, the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled in favor of Dusten Brown, granting him permanent custody of his daughter Veronica under the provisions of the ICWA. The decision held that the ICWA is a valid and necessary law for the protection of Native American children and families, and that its application in this case was essential to ensuring the best interests of Veronica. This ruling sparked an intense nation-wide debate on the role of tribal sovereignty in modern-day child custody and adoption cases involving Native American children. Advocates for Native American rights hailed the decision as a critical victory for the preservation of Native American culture and the recognition of tribal sovereignty in American family law. Conversely, opponents of the decision argued that the utilization of the ICWA in this case unfairly prioritized cultural considerations over the best interests of the child, potentially undermining the adoption process for countless American families. Following the verdict, Matt and Melanie Capobianco expressed disappointment and heartache but ultimately respected the court's decision and wished Dusten Brown and Veronica the best. Brown expressed his gratitude to the Oklahoma Supreme Court for the ruling and pledged to continue advocating for the rights of Native American children and families in courtrooms across the United States. The outcome of this case subsequently led to a renewed focus on the ICWA and its role in the American legal system. Lawmakers, child welfare advocates, and Native American organizations convened to discuss the law's impact on tribes and families, and explore possibilities for reform or clarification. The goal of these discussions was to ensure that the ICWA maintains its original intent to protect Native American children while striking a fair balance for all involved parties in cases of adoption and child custody. In the following years, the Dusten Brown case served as a cornerstone for Native American rights and child welfare reform. With an increased awareness of the ICWA's significance and a commitment to fair, balanced legislation, efforts were made to improve the law to better serve the interests of children, families, and Native American tribes across the country."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On the other hand, Leslie, not being a crafter, is not particularly familiar with the many types of glue available on the market, nor their ideal uses. Of course, she has used glue in some basic situations throughout her life, but her knowledge on the subject pales in comparison to Eric's expertise.  One day, they both decided to work together on a project for a local charity event. They were tasked with creating a large collage of pictures that represented the community's history. With Eric's expertise in crafting and Leslie's deep knowledge of their community's history, they made a great team. Eric taught Leslie about the different types of glue suited for the project, such as white glue for paper and photos, and a stronger adhesive for attaching heavier materials like buttons or wood. Leslie soaked in the knowledge and appreciated Eric's practical tips and insights.

Standing on a high walkway of planks behind the palisade of the crusaders' small wooden fort, he heard faraway voices and saw torches moving on the Cathar rampart. The two men on watch with him that night, a sergeant from Champagne and a young man-at-arms from Brittany, were talking in low tones about the women to be had far below, at the foot of the mountain. They seemed not to see the activity about the Cathar stronghold on the upper peak of the mountaintop opposite their own fort. But Roland, knowing Diane was in the besieged fortress, could not take his eyes from it. He knew he had to act soon. Each day the crusaders grew stronger and the Cathars weaker. Once the Cathar stronghold fell, the crusaders would slaughter all within, including Diane. The sergeant, chuckling, was offering his young companion a wineskin. The Breton never received it. From behind the Cathar wall came the sound of a huge thump, as if a giant's fist had pounded Mont Segur. Roland recognized the sound, and fought panic as he thrust his arms out, trying to push the other two men toward the ladder. But there was no time for them to climb down to safety. The thump was the counter-weight of a stone-caster, and the whistling noise that followed fast upon it was the rock it had thrown. A shape as big as a wine barrel blotted out the stars. The stone hit the parapet beside Roland, and the whole palisade shuddered.

When we consider a figure with \\"power to change and fix things far beyond our understanding,\\" it evokes thoughts of a supernatural or divine being. This could refer to a deity or an entity with immense capabilities that can have a significant impact on our world or reality. It implies that this being's abilities far surpass human comprehension, making it difficult for us to grasp the extent of their influence fully. The phrase conveys the idea that the being in question is capable of enacting profound changes and fixing problems that would be impossible for humans to address. This could include the power to alter the course of history, rectify societal issues, or even manipulate the nature of our reality. Such a being's actions would likely have substantial, lasting effects on our world. It is essential to understand that a being with such power could utilize it in various ways. Some might choose to use their abilities for the greater good, working to improve humanity's overall well-being and ensure a brighter future. Others might use their power for nefarious purposes, seeking personal gain or destructive ends. In any case, acknowledging that there exists a power greater than ourselves and our understanding often invokes a sense of humility, wonder, and even fear. This recognition can inspire a desire to learn more about such an entity and ponder the nature of its existence. It may encourage exploration of one's spirituality, faith, or philosophy to better comprehend the implications of a supreme being's presence. It is worth noting that many cultures and belief systems throughout history have developed their own interpretations of a being with divine or extraordinary power. These figures play an essential role in shaping the cultural and spiritual identities of the societies they originate from and may serve as a source of comfort and inspiration to countless individuals. Ultimately, the concept of a being with the power to change and fix things far beyond our understanding is a testament to humanity's curiosity and the quest to comprehend the often inexplicable nature of our existence.

A:","output":"Professor Lee Smolin is a theoretical physicist who has contributed substantially to the field of quantum gravity and is well-known for his work on loop quantum gravity.

He rushed into the classical music scene at the age of 12 after Itzhak Perlman, the famed violinist, heard him play. But nothing in his family history explains where Haimovitz got his extraordinary talent. And that's typical, Ellen Winner, a professor says. \\"People are fascinated by these children because they don't understand where their talent came from. You will see parents who say, 'I wasn't like this, and my husband wasn't like this.' It seems to sometimes just come out of the blue,\\" Winner says. It's not clear whether a prodigy's  brain is any different from the brains of other children, in part because there have been no study comparing the brains of prodigies to those of average people. \\"But I believe that anything that shows up so early, without training, has got to be either a genetic or some other biological basis,\\" Winner says. \\"If a child suddenly at the age of 3 goes to the piano and picks out a tune and does it beautifully, that has to be because that child has a different brain.\\" Children who are extremely gifted tend to be socially different, too, Winner says. \\"They feel like they can't find other kids like themselves, so they feel strange, maybe even like a freak, and feel like they don't have anybody to connect with. On the other hand, they also long to connect with other kids, and they can't find other kids like themselves.\\" As Haimovitz got older, he became frustrated. He wanted to play other kinds of music but felt constricted by the image and the expectations of the boy prodigy who played classical music and filled concert halls. \\"When you start that early, you suddenly start to grow up in public, and I wanted to experiment,\\" Haimovitz says. So he took his cello into punk rock clubs and coffee houses. He played Bach, Haydn and Hendrix. \\"My teacher was Leonard Rose, and we never played any 20th-century music. He didn't like it. But once I was exposed to James Marshall \\"Jimi\\" Hendrix, Miles Dewey Davis El and others, I couldn't...

I end this small run of blog posts with the question posed by Professor Brian Boyd at the beginning of our evening: Do we want to close the achievement gap? We know we can close the gap. It’s been done or almost been done before in Scottish education, but the answers have been ignored as they pass us by. The simple clue is this: poverty is single biggest predictor of achievement, and according to research (Hammonds sic, reference required), aged 10, a child living in poverty is 60% less likely to get to university. Boyd borrowed from his own mother’s report card to ask us what kind of education we desire. Is it the academic success at all costs route, or is there another option we need to value as much, if not more? His mother’s report card, one that prevented her from becoming a secondary school pupil in Glasgow, is filled with G and FG, until the last point: Character and conduct - excellent. What kind of pupils do we want to develop in Scotland? What do we value in our assessment system? Opening up opportunity for all is a tough game to play when the examination system rewards only certain types of behaviour, few of them related to what the Curriculum for Excellence says we stand for. In his own small community in East Kilbride, three secondary schools enter a period of meltdown as the local rag sets about creating its own local league table of performance, with those three ‘teams’ in competition for the top spot (or at least not the bottom one). Therefore, we must stop basing “the gap” largely on attainment. First of all, Boyd would like us to remove the traditional, and non-sensical academic/vocational divide. Is the law or medicine degree we value not vocational? (Are all General Practitioners not Plumbers, as Dr Murray on the panel suggests?)

While hiding out at the home of Mattie and her two children, Bowie unwittingly insults Mattie by comparing her with his mother during an exchange that initially sounds like a pick-up. The insult, combined with the lascivious attention of the much older T-Dub toward Mattie's daughter Lula, and Bowie's later return with the young Keechie (now pregnant with Bowie's child) in tow inspires Mattie's revenge against Bowie. Bowie is injured in an auto accident and takes refuge with the daughter of the gas station attendant, Keechie.

Write an article based on this summary: Understand what market share can demonstrate about a business. Comprehend the limitations of the market share indicator. Think about how market share should shape your investment strategy.","output":"Title: Market Share: A Critical Tool for Investors Introduction Market share is a critical metric used by investors to assess a company's success in a competitive industry. Understanding the underlying dynamics of market share provides valuable insights into a business's overall performance and growth prospects. However, market share alone should not be the sole determinant of an investment strategy, as several limitations affect its reliability. This article explores the importance of market share, its limitations, and how it should influence your investment strategy. Market Share: A Reflection of Business Success Market share is calculated by dividing a firm's sales revenue by the total sales revenue of all companies in a specific market or industry. A higher market share could indicate the following attributes about a business: 1. Market dominance: A company with substantial market share often holds a significant advantage over its rivals due to economies of scale, brand value, and a competitive position. This advantage translates into higher profitability and revenue growth. 2. Customer loyalty: A higher market share indicates a strong customer base, with satisfied clients being more likely to continue patronizing the business and recommend it to others. This loyalty can enhance a firm's growth prospects and its capacity to withstand market fluctuations. 3. Innovation and product development: Successful businesses often invest a portion of their profits into research and development, allowing them to improve their products or services. As a result, a company with a solid market share may have a better product offering that sets it apart from competitors and attracts more customers. Limitations of Market Share as an Investment Indicator Despite its significance, several drawbacks to relying solely on market share as an investment indicator should be considered. These limitations include: 1. Market share doesn't provide insight into profitability: A company with high market share might still undergo a financial crisis due to slim profit margins, poor management, or intense competition. 2. Market saturation: A company with a high market share in a saturated market might face challenges in finding new growth opportunities. 3. Market share doesn't always account for external factors: Market share might not consider the impact of government regulations, changing consumer preferences, or technological advancements that could potentially disrupt the industry landscape. 4. Misleading market segmentation: Market share calculations heavily rely on the market segment's definition, which could be inaccurate or misleading. If a company's products or services are wrongly or narrowly categorized, its market share may appear misleadingly high or low. Incorporating Market Share into Investment Strategy Given the advantages and limitations mentioned above, investors should employ a balanced approach when incorporating market share into their investment strategy: 1. Consider market share as one of several key performance indicators: While it offers valuable insights into a company's competitive position, investors should also consider profitability, revenue growth, and other financial ratios when analyzing an investment opportunity. 2. Assess industry dynamics: Investors should evaluate the industry's overall performance and competitive landscape to gain a holistic understanding of a company's market position. This will enable them to make better-informed investment decisions. 3. Monitor market trends: Regularly analyzing trends in consumer preferences, competition, and technology enables investors to predict potential market shifts, thereby staying prepared to adapt their investment strategy accordingly. Conclusion Market share serves as an essential tool that offers critical insights into a company's performance and position within its industry. However, investors should recognize its limitations and employ a comprehensive approach that considers multiple factors when shaping their investment strategies. By doing so, they can maximize their success in identifying businesses with strong growth potential and favorable investment prospects."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Whose history paintings had primarily been of themes of classical mythology?  The painting shows the moment from Summer in which Musidora, having removed the last of her clothes, steps into \\"the lucid coolness of the flood\\" to \\"bathe her fervent limbs in the refreshing stream\\". Damon is not shown; instead, Etty illustrates the scene from Damon's viewpoint. By placing the audience in Damon's position, Etty aimed to induce the same reactions in the viewer as Damon's dilemma as described by Thomson; that of whether to enjoy the spectacle despite knowing it to be inappropriate, or to follow the accepted morality of the time and look away, in what art historian Sarah Burnage has described as \\"a titillating moral test for spectators to both enjoy and overcome\\".The pose of Musidora is based on that of the Aphrodite of Cnidus and the Venus de' Medici. It is possible that Etty was also familiar with Thomas Gainsborough's Musidora, which shares similar elements. Gainsborough's Musidora, his only large nude, was never exhibited in his lifetime and remained in private hands until 1847, but Etty was familiar with its then-owner Robert Vernon and may have seen it in his collection. The setting for the painting is a pool in the grounds of The Plantation, a house in the village of Acomb, near York. The Plantation was the home of his close friend and patron the Reverend Isaac Spencer, vicar of Acomb, and its grounds were a scene Etty had previously painted. In 1846 Etty bought a house in York for his retirement; Burnage speculates that Etty chose Acomb on the grounds that a view of York was quintessentially English.Although Etty had traditionally worked in the Venetian style of painting, with rich colours and detail, for Musidora he adopted a much softer and earthier palette, although his use of reflected light on flesh is derived from Venetian styles. He moved away from Rubens, who up to this time had been his greatest influence, and closer to the style of Titian. This is likely owing to the nature of the subject matter. Until then his history paintings had primarily been of themes of classical...

In this case, the fact that the military man playing drums is in a parade does correspond with the hypothesis that there is a man in a parade (since a military man is also a man).

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Frank Chambers a drifter, stops at a depression-era rural California diner for a meal and ends up working there. The diner is operated by a young, beautiful woman, Cora Smith, and her much older husband, Nick Papadakis, a hardworking but unimaginative immigrant from Greece. Frank and Cora start to have an affair soon after they meet. Cora is tired of her situation, married to an older man she does not love, and working at a diner that she wishes to own and improve. She and Frank scheme to murder Nick to start a new life together without her losing the diner. Their first attempt at the murder is a failure, but Nick is not even aware they tried to kill him, so goes about living his life as usual. Frank and Cora succeed with their next attempt. The local prosecutor suspects what has actually occurred but does not have enough evidence to prove it. As a tactic intended to get Cora and Frank to turn on one another, he tries only Cora for the crime. Although they turn against each other, a clever ploy from Cora's lawyer, Katz, prevents Cora's full confession from coming into the hands of the prosecutor. With the tactic having failed to generate any new evidence for the prosecution, Cora benefits from a deal in which she pleads guilty to manslaughter and is sentenced to probation. Months later, Frank has an affair with Madge Gorland while Cora is out of town. When Cora returns, she tells Frank she is pregnant. That night, Katz's assistant, Kennedy, appears at their door and threatens to expose them unless they give him 10,000. Enraged, Frank beats Kennedy up and strong-arms him into giving up the evidence against them.

Two rival groups of Acromyrmex heyeri ants, group A and group B, are battling each other to gain territory. The goal is to attack the rival group when they have more openings in their nest thatch. In battle day one group A territory had 5 °C temperature. In battle day two group A territory had 22 °C temperature. In battle day three group A territory had low air humidity. In battle day four group A territory had high air humidity.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   In battle day two would group A have less openings or more openings in their nest thatch?  Hint: Acromyrmex heyeri is a species of leaf-cutter ant, a New World ant of the subfamily Myrmicinae of the genus Acromyrmex. Acromyrmex heyeri workers construct the colonies nest by thatching together cut grass. At temperatures ranging from 20–30 °C, workers created more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up as a method of temperature regulation for the colony. The workers will close openings in the nest thatch as the air humidity surrounding the nest decreases to reduce water loss for the colony. The answer to this question is:","output":"In battle day two, group A would have more openings in their nest thatch. This is because the temperature on day two is 22 °C, which is within the range of 20-30 °C where Acromyrmex heyeri ants create more openings in the nest thatch for temperature regulation. The ants do this to manage the internal nest temperature as it goes up, allowing for a more comfortable environment for the colony."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In many card games involving a dealer, the objective is for the player to achieve a higher score or have a more valuable hand of cards than the dealer, without exceeding certain game-specific limits. Additionally, the game may also involve specific rules, strategies, and associated probabilities that can impact the outcome. Players will use a combination of skills, strategies, and sometimes, pure luck to try and outperform the dealer. The dealer, on the other hand, is usually bound by the rules of the game and predetermined actions, which often give players an opportunity to exploit the game and potentially gain an advantage.

It was the first composed for a feast day, Pentecost Sunday (Whit Sunday), Pentecost being a high holiday along with Christmas and Easter. The prescribed readings for the feast day are taken from the Acts of the Apostles, on the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:1–13), and from the Gospel of John, in which Jesus announces the Spirit who will teach, in his Farewell discourse (John 14:23–31). As in many Bach cantatas, the libretto is compiled from Bible text, contemporary poetry and chorale. The poetry is attributed to Salomon Franck, although the verses are not included in his printed editions. Several of Bach's early stylistic mannerisms appear here, such as a biblical quotation in a recitative second movement rather than in a first choral movement, arias following each other without a recitative in between, and dialogue in a duet.Franck's text shows elements of early Pietism: the expression of extreme feelings, for example \\"O seligste Zeiten!\\" (O most blessed times) in the opening chorus, and a \\"mystical demeanour\\", for example in the duet of the Soul and the Spirit united. In the middle section of the first movement, Franck paraphrases the Gospel text, which says in verse 23 that God wants to dwell with man, to \\"Gott will sich die Seelen zu Tempeln bereiten\\" (God Himself shall prepare our souls for His  temple, more literally: \\"God wants to prepare [our] souls to become his temples\\"). The words for the recitative are the quotation of verse 23 from the Gospel of John, \\"Wer mich liebet, der wird mein Wort halten\\" (Whoever loves Me will keep My Word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our dwelling with him). Movement 3 addresses the Trinity and movement 4 the Spirit that was present at the Creation. Movement 5 is a duet of the Soul and the Spirit, underlined by an instrumental quote from Martin Luther's Pentecost hymn \\"Komm, Heiliger Geist, Herre Gott\\", which is based on the Latin hymn \\"Veni Sancte Spiritus, reple tuorum corda fidelium\\"....

(The Washington Post)      A Russian jet was shot down by Turkish warplanes on Nov. 24, 2015, the first time since 1952 that a NATO jet shot down a Russian jet. (The Washington Post)      The downing of a Russian warplane by Turkish F-16s over the Syrian border has split two obstinate strongmen deeply involved in Syria’s increasingly crowded civil war: Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.      Officials from both countries on Wednesday discounted the possibility of direct conflict over the downing. “We are not going to wage a war on Turkey,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters, although he said Moscow viewed the attack as a “planned provocation.”      The Turkish government offered its condolences for the deaths of a Russian pilot and a marine in the downing of the plane and an attempted rescue of its crew, Russia’s first combat fatalities in the country’s two-month-old airstrike campaign in Syria.      But the incident has revealed the potential for conflict between foreign powers supporting and opposing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad despite a shared opposition to the Islamic State. In particular, Russian airstrikes against Turkish-backed rebel groups have fomented deep frustration in Ankara.      “There is a clear message from the Turks with this downing of a Russian jet,” said Mustafa Alani, a Middle East expert at the Geneva-based Gulf Research Center. “It is a check on Russia’s policy in the region. Russia can’t do whatever it wants.”                  Russia says its Su-24 bomber did not violate Turkish airspace, but Turkish officials say it did. Putin hypothesized Tuesday that even if the plane did briefly enter Turkish airspace, it was not a threat.      [This is the Russian plane that Turkey just shot down]      In Moscow at least, the event is being seen as something larger than an attack on an errant jet.      “The conflict happened because Russia was attacking rebel groups allied with Turkey,” said Alexander Baunov, an analyst at the Moscow Carnegie Center, when asked about the possibility of an accidental clash. “It’s wrong to say that this happened because of anything like crowded skies.”      The Russian Defense Ministry announced in a statement Wednesday that Russian fighter jets will now escort the bombers, and Moscow will move into Syria powerful new ground-to-air missiles that can reach across the country and far into Turkey from the Russian air base in the province of Latakia on Syria’s Mediterranean coast.      Additionally, analysts say, Russia will choose from a menu of asymmetric responses in retaliation against Turkey, including informal economic sanctions and providing military aid to Turkey’s enemies, including the Kurds.      “Of course, Russia is going to intensify strikes on that part of Syria and on those groups that are affiliated with Turkey,” said Fyodor Lukyanov, a prominent Russian political analyst. He added that Russia probably would not scale back its deployment in Syria because of the incident.      1 of 7 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × The moment when a Russian warplane is shot down by Turkey View Photos Russia confirmed its plane had been downed but denied it had violated Turkish airspace during a bombing campaign in Syria.

Nov. 24, 2015 A still image from video footage shows the burning trail of a Russian fighter jet after being shot down near the Turkish-Syrian border. The jet was reportedly downed by Turkish forces, Turkish state news agency Anadolu reported, citing sources in the presidency. Haberturk TV Channel/via European Pressphoto Agency Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.      On Wednesday evening, Turkey’s state-run news agency, Anadolu, reported that Russian airstrikes targeted Turkish aid vehicles in the Syrian border town of Azzaz, killing at least seven drivers. The town is a hub for supplies being delivered from Turkey to Syrian rebels fighting government forces in the nearby city of Aleppo. The details of the incident could not be assessed independently.      Shady al-Ouaineh, a media ­representative for Determined Storm, a rebel group associated with the Free Syrian Army, said in a telephone interview that Russia had dramatically intensified air raids in rebel-held areas of Latakia province. Syrian government forces and allied Shiite militiamen from Iraq, backed by Russian air cover, have been trying to advance on some of the last opposition holdouts in the province, said Ouaineh, close to where the Russian jet was shot down.      “It is clear Russia is taking out its revenge on us here,” he said.      [NATO faces new Mideast crisis after downing of Russian jet by Turkey]      Russian attitudes toward Turkey, which were reasonably friendly a year ago, have turned cold with alarming speed. Most Russian tour operators stopped selling travel packages to Turkey on Wednesday. Protesters in Moscow pelted the Turkish Embassy with eggs and rocks, shattering windows. Russian lawmakers introduced a bill that would criminalize denying that the mass killings of Armenians in 1915 by the Ottoman Empire was a “genocide.” The issue remains highly sensitive: Turkey acknowledges that atrocities occurred but has long denied that what took place constituted a genocide.      Last December, Russia diverted a planned gas line away from Europe to Turkey in order to spurn the West. That project’s fate is also now in doubt.      “The consequences are going to be significant,” Lukyanov said.      Russia will seek retribution against Turkey but wants to avoid antagonizing the West, Baunov said. “If this becomes a fight between Russia and the West, then that goes against the goals of the intervention in the first place: to escape international isolation connected to sanctions,” he said.      Those sanctions were imposed after Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula and backed separatist rebels in Ukraine’s southeast.      President Obama, meeting with French President François Hollande in Washington on Tuesday, said that Turkey had a right to defend its airspace and accused Russia of attacking moderate opposition groups as opposed to the Islamic State. Russia has said it carries out airstrikes only against terrorist organizations.      “They are operating very close to a Turkish border and they are going after a moderate opposition that are supported by not only Turkey but a wide range of countries,” Obama said. At the same time he discouraged “any kind of escalation.”      [U.S., France to press allies for more assets in fight against the Islamic State]      The frantic Russian search for the missing bomber crew was marred by the death of a marine on an Mi-8 helicopter hit by an antitank missile.      “One on board was wounded when he parachuted down and killed in a savage way on the ground by the jihadists,” Alexander Orlov, the Russian ambassador to France, told Europe 1 radio. “The other managed to escape and, according to the latest information, has been picked up by the Syrian army and should be going back to the Russian air force base.”      Putin has promised the Russian public a limited engagement in Syria, with no ground forces, to limit casualties. Although the Syrian army has managed to halt a rebel offensive, Russian air power has not yet led to a significant turn of the tide in the war.      “Turkey dealt a major blow to Putin, and now he’s been placed between a rock and a hard place,” said Fawaz A. Gerges, a professor of international relations at the London School of Economics. “There could be mission creep where Russia will get entangled in an unwinnable war.”      Naylor reported from Beirut.

Sailor Jack and Bingo are the mascots for what prize awarding snack food, now produced by Frito Lay????","output":"Sailor Jack and Bingo are the iconic mascots for Cracker Jack, a snack food now produced by Frito-Lay, a subsidiary of PepsiCo. Cracker Jack is a time-honored confection that consists of molasses-flavored, caramel-coated popcorn, and peanuts. Sailor Jack, depicted as a young boy wearing a sailor's outfit, and his dog companion, Bingo, have been the official mascots of this beloved snack since the early 20th century. The history of Cracker Jack dates back to 1893 when the introduction of this tasty treat took place during the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Two brothers, Frederick and Louis Rueckheim, concocted the combination of popcorn, peanuts, and molasses that would eventually become Cracker Jack. It was initially named \\"Candied Popcorn and Peanuts,\\" but its name was changed to Cracker Jack in 1896 when a salesman reportedly exclaimed, \\"That's a crackerjack!\\" referring to the snack's excellent taste and quality. The Prize Inside, or \\"Toy Surprise,\\" is one of Cracker Jack's signature features. This has been a part of the snack since 1912 and is the main reason behind its enduring popularity. The Prize Inside has evolved over the years, starting with small toys and trinkets, moving to paper-based items, and eventually transitioning to codes for digital games and experiences. In 1916, Sailor Jack and Bingo made their debut as the Cracker Jack mascots. The boy depicted as Sailor Jack was based on Robert Rueckheim, Frederick Rueckheim's grandson. Sadly, Robert passed away at a young age, but his image lives on as the iconic mascot. The connection between the sailor imagery and the snack's name is thought to be inspired by the phrase \\"cracker jack,\\" which was a slang term for a sailor in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The image of Sailor Jack saluting with Bingo by his side has been part of the Cracker Jack brand ever since, although their appearances have been slightly updated over the years to align with modern tastes and design trends. Cracker Jack was acquired by Borden in 1964, and 30 years later, in 1994, it was bought by Frito-Lay, a subsidiary of PepsiCo. Frito-Lay has maintained the tradition of the Prize Inside, Sailor Jack and Bingo while continuing to produce the classic snack for generations to enjoy. During its long history, Cracker Jack has become synonymous with American nostalgia, baseball games, and family fun, making it a timeless and much-loved snack."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Here's a question: He was stabbing to death his wife when he was caught, at trial he still denied the what?

You can start by drawing your ideas on paper and then, maybe with some help from an adult, cut out fabric to make your design come to life. So, the first question talks about how designers can keep their creations safe, while the second question talks about how to create your own fashion designs."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I read this background article the other day: A) In a straight-chain molecule, all the carbon atoms are lined up in a row like cars of a train. The carbon atoms form the “backbone” of the molecule. B) In a branched-chain molecule, at least one of the carbon atoms branches off from the backbone. C) In a cyclic molecule, the chain of carbon atoms is joined at the two ends to form a ring. Each ring usually contains just five or six carbon atoms, but rings can join together to form larger molecules. A cyclic molecule generally has higher boiling and melting points than straight-chain and branched-chain molecules.  I am facing a new situation today: Mark works as a scientist for a molecular research institute. Today, he has three samples of molecule in front of him, sample A, sample B, and sample C. Sample A is a straight-chain molecule; sample B is a branched-chain molecule; and sample C is a cyclic molecule. Mark's job is to determine the characteristics of each sample.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which sample would have lower boiling point, sample A or sample C? The answer to this question is:","output":"Sample A would have a lower boiling point compared to Sample C. This conclusion is based on the information provided in the background article, which states that cyclic molecules generally have higher boiling and melting points than straight-chain and branched-chain molecules. Since Sample A is a straight-chain molecule and Sample C is a cyclic molecule, Sample A would likely have a lower boiling point. The reason for this difference in boiling points can be attributed to the strength of intermolecular forces within the molecules. In cyclic molecules, the structure often leads to stronger intermolecular forces, such as van der Waals forces or potential H-bonding, that require more energy to overcome and cause the substance to change its state. On the other hand, straight-chain molecules have comparatively weaker intermolecular forces, making it easier for them to transition from one state to another, and thus a lower boiling point can be expected."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Plot title: Tomorrow Never Dies Movie plot: On the border region of Russia, a large bazaar of illegally obtained weapons are being sold to international terrorists. Far away, in an observation room, M, her assistant, Charles Robinson and a British admiral, Roebuck, are watching the operation through cameras placed by an agent they've sent into the area. They identify many of the weapons and several of the buyers.Over M's protests, the officers agree to launch a guided missile into the area believing that they will eliminate half of the world's most dangerous criminals. The missile is launched from a British frigate and speeds toward the target just as the command center receives a radio call from their agent on the scene. Among the camera images is a plane holding two powerful soviet nuclear weapons which may be triggered by the guided missile. An attempt to abort the missile attack fails and the agent, who is revealed to be James Bond, rushes into the area to steal the plane and the bombs. The attack causes most of the terrorists to flee the area.Bond reaches the plane and knocks the pilot in it unconscious. He successfully escapes the valley before the missile hits but is pursued by another of the surviving terrorists in a plane identical to his. He evades the 2nd plane, however, the pilot he knocked out awakes and throws a heavy cord around Bond's neck. Bond keeps control of the plane, flying under the second one and activates the rear ejection seat of his own plane, throwing the man up into the other plane, causing it to explode. Bond contacts the command center and tells them he is flying home with the nukes, asking the admiral where he wants his bombs delivered.In the South China sea, a British missile frigate, the HMS Devonshire, is on patrol and is being threatened by Chinese MIGs.

Why do many female porn stars have long fingernails? How often do porn stars actually have an orgasm on camera? Options: [-] no [-] yes The answer is:","output":"no These two questions are not the same. The first question, \\"Why do many female porn stars have long fingernails?\\", addresses the aesthetics and presentation of female porn actresses within the industry. This question is focused on the visual aspect and the reasoning behind a specific style choice. There could be several reasons for this trend, including that long fingernails are seen as an attractive or alluring feature by some audiences, enhancing the femininity and overall attractiveness of female performers. Additionally, long fingernails may be used as a personal style choice by the performers themselves, or as a branding element to create unique and memorable personas. On the other hand, the second question, \\"How often do porn stars actually have an orgasm on camera?\\", inquires about the authenticity of the sexual pleasure experienced by the performers while filming adult content. This question delves into the behind-the-scenes reality of the adult film industry and the experiences of porn star performers, possibly addressing concerns regarding the morality and ethics of the industry. The answer to this question can vary depending on the type of adult film and the specific performers involved. Some porn stars may genuinely experience orgasms on camera, while others may simulate them for the sake of the production. The frequency of genuine orgasms could depend on factors such as the level of comfort between performers, mental and physical wellbeing, and individual sexual responses. Ultimately, this question is focused on the internal experiences of the performers, as opposed to their outward appearance. In summary, the answer is \\"no,\\" the two questions are not the same, as they address different aspects of the adult film industry—one focusing on style choices and aesthetics of female performers, and the other exploring the authenticity of their sexual experiences on camera."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Together with his companion, the mysterious Umbopo, they penetrate unknown country, following a map believed to be genuine. It transpires that Professor Huston has been captured by a German military expedition on the same quest, led by Bockner (Herbert Lom), a single-minded knackwurst-munching, bald-headed Colonel and a ruthless Turkish slave-trader and adventurer, Dogati (John Rhys-Davies). Huston is being forced to interpret another map, also believed to be genuine. The two rival expeditions shadow each other, clashing on several occasions, and finally enter the tribal lands of the Kukuana who capture them. The tribe is under the control of the evil priestess, Gagoola, who has Quatermain hung upside down over a pond full of crocodiles. Just when all seems lost, Umbopo arrives and after defeating Gagoola's warriors in combat, reveals his identity as an exiled tribal chief and the rightful ruler of the Kukuanas. As the tribesmen submit to him, Gagoola captures Jesse and flees into caves in the depths of the Breasts of Sheba, the twin mountain peaks where the mines are located. They are pursued by Bockner and Dogati, who attack the village in full force. They follow Quatermain and Umbopo to the entrance to the mines, but are hampered by a moat of quicksand. Bockner orders his men forward into the moat, but they have trouble crossing it. Dogati then kills all of Bockner's soldiers, as well as most of his own men, and uses their bodies as stepping stones to cross the moat safely. As they approach the entrance, Bockner shoots Dogati and takes command of what little remains of the party. Inside the mines, Quatermain and Umbopo rescue Jesse and find the resting place of all the former tribal queens, including the Queen of Sheba herself, encased in crystal.

He always keeps a  closed container of nitrogen gas in his freezer, where the temperature is very low.  Nicholas's neighbor, Justin, likes to grill in his backyard. Justin, therefore, always keeps a closed container of propane gas outside, where the temperature is high.  But I can use this background: Shown in the Figure below is a cylinder of gas on the left that is at room temperature (300 K). On the right, the cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before. As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles. Decreasing the temperature would have the opposite effect, and the pressure of an enclosed gas would decrease.  What is an answer for this question: The container of which gas will have lower pressure inside it? A:","output":"The container with the lower pressure inside it would be the container of nitrogen gas that Nicholas keeps in his freezer. Since the temperature in the freezer is very low, the gas molecules will have a lower kinetic energy and thus collide less forcefully with the walls of the container, resulting in lower pressure inside the container.

Children celebrate by hunting for colored eggs that their parents have hidden around the house. People also give Easter baskets filled with candy and other goodies to one another to celebrate the day. But the holiday is more than new clothes and good things to eat. On Easter, many people go to church to celebrate Jesus' resurrection from the dead. Most people color Easter eggs. Some people hide them. Others just eat them. But no matter what one does with Easter eggs,they are an important Easter tradition throughout the Western world. People from many different cultures celebrate Easter. In both America and Belgium, children look for Easter eggs hidden on lawns and in bushes. In America, children believe the eggs are hidden by the Easter bunny  .But in Belgium, the hidden eggs are supposed to have fallen from church bells.

Answer based on context: Following their third loss of the season, the Indianapolis Colts entered their home game against the Cincinnati Bengals with a chance to regain the lead in the AFC South.  Indianapolis came out energized in the first quarter where the Colts picked up a field goal with three minutes remaining in the quarter, and a Kelvin Hayden interception returned for a touchdown.  The second quarter continued to see Colts dominance with a Javarris James touchdown run, extending the Colts lead to 17-0.  However, as the quarter wore on the defense began to allow larger gains and the Bengals were able to score a touchdown and a field goal in the last ten minutes of the half.  However, an Adam Vinatieri field goal gave the Colts a 20-10 lead going into halftime.  The Colts came out in the third quarter sluggish and both teams exchanged the ball throughout the rest of the quarter.  Another Vinatieri field goal gave the Colts a 23-10 lead.  With everything seeming secure, the Bengals were able to pick up a touchdown on a 19-yard pass from Carson Palmer making it a six-point game.  The Bengals onside kick attempt was successful with a late penalty by the Colts, giving the Bengals the ball at the Colts 40-yard line.  A fumble, the fifth turnover by the Bengals on the day, gave the Colts the ability to hold on to the lead and win the game 23-17, going to 6-3 on the season and taking first place in the AFC South by one game. How many points were scored total in the game?","output":"The total points scored in the game is 40. Here's how we calculate it:  We add the points scored by both teams together. The Indianapolis Colts scored 23 points and the Cincinnati Bengals scored 17 points. So when we add those together - that's 23 points (for the Colts) plus 17 points (for the Bengals), we get 40 points in the entire game.

If you don’t have a thermometer, aim to use water that is around room temperature to keep your pet as comfortable as possible.  This method is particularly useful for cats, rabbits, or any other animals that generally don’t like being given baths. If you don’t have a spray bottle, you can also simply mix warm water with some dish soap and use a flea comb dipped in this mixture to keep your pet’s fleas. However, this won’t be as effective as using a spray bottle to apply the mix. You can either wrap your pet in a towel to keep it from moving or gently hold it down by its neck. Be very gentle when holding your pet down; remember that this might be very stressful for them!  Make sure your pet’s fur is completely soaked through before moving on to the next step. Be sure to avoid getting water in your pet’s eyes or ears, since this will irritate them. Use around 2 to 3 teaspoons (9.9 to 14.8 mL) of dish soap to begin with and add more as needed. Start applying the soap at the neck and work your way down towards the tail. Make sure to rub the soap deep enough into the fur so that it reaches your pet’s skin.  Fleas typically live and lay their eggs close to an animal’s skin, so it’s important that you make sure the dish soap reaches all the way down to your pet’s skin to kill all of the fleas. If your pet has really thick fur, you may need to apply a bit more dish soap to make sure you’re reaching down to the skin. Start from the top of your pet’s body and work your way down toward the tail. For best results, use a flea comb to brush your furry friend’s hair as you rinse off the soap to make sure you’re removing as many fleas as possible. Note that you may need to spray a lot of water on a single area in order to get all the soap off. Your pet may be especially tense after this process, especially if it’s a cat.

On a clear day, you might see a grain silo 20 miles away. You might think to yourself, it sure is flat around here. If you drive one hundred miles to the south, the landscape changes. In southern Illinois, there are rolling hills. Why do you think this is? What could have caused these features? There are no big rivers that may have eroded and deposited this material. The ground is capable of supporting grass and trees, so wind erosion would not explain it. To answer the question, you need to go back 12,000 years. Around 12,000 years ago, a giant ice sheet covered much of the Midwest United States. Springfield, Illinois, was covered by over a mile of ice. Its hard to imagine a mile thick sheet of ice. The massive ice sheet, called a glacier, caused the features on the land you see today. Where did glaciers go? Where can you see them today? Glaciers are masses of flowing ice.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What couldn't the erosion have been caused by?\\" is \\"The erosion couldn't have been from wind or rivers\\"?","output":"Yes, according to the information provided, the erosion couldn't have been caused by wind or rivers. The differences in landscape - flat terrain in central Illinois and rolling hills in southern Illinois - are attributed to the impact of the glaciers that covered much of the Midwest United States around 12,000 years ago. Glaciers are large, slow-moving masses of ice that can drastically change the landscape and topography of an area over long periods of time. During the last Ice Age, glaciers covered vast portions of North America. As the glaciers moved, they eroded the land underneath, scraping away soil and rock and leaving a flat surface in their wake. This process likely contributed to the creation of the flat terrain in central Illinois. In areas where the glaciers retreated or stopped, the ice could have deposited debris left behind, resulting in the formation of rolling hills like those found in southern Illinois. This process, called glacial deposition, occurs when a glacier melts, releasing the accumulated sediment it was carrying. Consequently, the terrain becomes more uneven and characterized by hills and valleys. As for the last part of the question, glaciers still exist today, although they have retreated significantly since the height of the Ice Age. Presently, you can find glaciers in polar regions like Antarctica and the Arctic, as well as in mountainous areas such as the Andes, the Alps, the Rockies, and the Himalayas. Many of these glaciers are melting at an accelerated rate due to climate change, which poses numerous environmental and societal challenges."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was built to reinforce a weak point in the defences of the castle?  The current entrance in the north-east occupies the approximate location of the main gatehouse constructed by Gundulf and then rebuilt during 1249–1250. It was pulled down in the 1870s when the enclosure was converted into a municipal garden. An engraving from 1735 by the Buck brothers gives some indication of the gatehouse's form: the gate was an archway between two towers projecting from the curtain wall. It was reached by a stone causeway across a ditch, rather than a drawbridge. A tower containing a postern gate was located in the north-west corner of the enclosure, built at the close of the 14th century to guard the bridge over the Medway. The tower and postern no longer stands, but 19th-century antiquary and engineer G. T. Clark made some notes on the structure while it was still standing and commented that it had mechanisms to lift supplies for the castle from the river. The western part of the stone outer wall, a stretch facing the river, dates from when Gundulf built the first wall enclosing the castle. In the 19th century a revetment was added to strengthen the decaying wall. Like the keep, it was constructed using Kentish Ragstone. This part of Gundulf's wall was 4.5 feet (1.4 m) thick at the base, narrowing to 2 feet (0.61 m) at the top; it rose to a height of around 22 feet (6.7 m). Four embrasures were added to this part of the wall in the 13th century, although the builders imitated Norman design. At the northern end of the 12th-century stretch of western wall are the remains of a building, probably a hall, dating from the 13th century. Although no longer standing, it is known it had a vaulted undercroft.In the south Gundulf's wall survived into the modern period, although has now been dismantled. The current wall is a 19th-century replacement. At the eastern end of this wall, near the southern corner of the castle, is a two-storey rounded tower 30 feet (9.1 m) in diameter dating from the early 13th century. It was built to fill the breach in the curtain wall caused when John's army besieged...

The band has gone through several phases; its strongest commercial success occurred between 1978 and 1987. During that period, the band released a series of hit songs, including \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" (1981), which in 2009 became the top-selling track in iTunes history among songs not released in the 21st century. Its parent studio album, Escape, the band's eighth and most successful, reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and yielded another of their most popular singles, \\"Open Arms\\". With Cain on board, the band began writing material that would eventually lead up to Journey's biggest studio album, \\"Escape\\". Recording sessions began in April 1981, and lasted until the middle of June. Escape was released on July 31, 1981, and immediately the album became a mainstream success. The album, which has thus far sold nine times platinum, went to number one on the album charts later that year, and included three top-ten hits: \\"Who's Cryin' Now\\", \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" and \\"Open Arms\\". The last is Journey's highest-charting single to date, staying at No. 2 for six consecutive weeks and ranking at No.34 on Billboard's 1982 year-end Hot 100. MTV videotaped one of their two sold-out shows in Houston on November 6, 1981, in front of over 20,000 fans.  Capitalizing on their success, the band recorded radio commercials for Budweiser and sold rights to their likenesses and music for use in two video games: the Journey arcade game by Bally/Midway and Journey Escape by Data Age for the Atari 2600.  This success was met with criticism. The 1983 Rolling Stone Record Guide gave each of the band's albums only one star, with Dave Marsh writing that \\"Journey was a dead end for San Francisco area rock.\\" Marsh later would anoint Escape as one of the worst number-one albums of all time.  Journey's next album, Frontiers (1983), continued their commercial success, reaching No. 2 on the album charts, selling nearly six million copies. The album generated four Top 40 hits, \\"Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)\\", which reached No. 8, \\"Faithfully\\", which reached No. 12, \\"Send Her My Love\\" and \\"After the Fall\\", both of which reached No. 23. By this time, Journey had become one of the top touring and recording bands in the world. During the subsequent stadium tour, the band contracted with NFL Films to record a video documentary of their life on the road, Frontiers and Beyond. Scenes from the documentary were shot at JFK Stadium in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania with more than 80,000 fans in attendance.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: The Shadow is the name of a collection of serialized dramas, originally in 1930s pulp novels, and then in a wide variety of media, and it is also used to refer to the character featured in The Shadow media. One of the most famous adventure heroes of the 20th century United States, the Shadow has been featured on the radio, in a long-running pulp magazine series, in American comic books, comic strips, television, serials, video games, and at least five films. The radio drama included episodes voiced by Orson Welles. Originally simply a mysterious radio narrator who hosted a program designed to promote magazine sales for Street and Smith Publications, The Shadow was developed into a distinctive literary character, later to become a pop culture icon, by writer Walter B. Gibson in 1931. In print, The Shadow's real name is Kent Allard, and he was a famed aviator who fought for the French during World War I. He became known by the alias the Black Eagle, according to The Shadow's Shadow (1933), although later stories revised this alias as the Dark Eagle, beginning with The Shadow Unmasks (1937). After the war, Allard finds a new challenge in waging war on criminals. Allard falsifies his death in the South American jungles, then returns to the United States. Arriving in New York City, he adopts numerous identities to conceal his existence.  One of the identities Allard assumes--indeed, the best known--is that of Lamont Cranston, a \\"wealthy young man-about-town.\\" In the pulps, Cranston is a separate character; Allard frequently disguises himself as Cranston and adopts his identity (The Shadow Laughs, 1931). While Cranston travels the world, Allard assumes his identity in New York. In their first meeting, Allard, as The Shadow, threatens Cranston, saying he has arranged to switch signatures on various documents and other means that will allow him to take over the Lamont Cranston identity entirely unless Cranston agrees to allow Allard to impersonate him when he is abroad. Although alarmed at first, Cranston is amused by the irony of the situation and agrees. The two men sometimes meet in order to impersonate each other (Crime over Miami, 1940). The disguise works well because Allard and Cranston resemble each other (Dictator of Crime, 1941).  His other disguises include businessman Henry Arnaud, who first appeared in The Black Master (March 1, 1932), which revealed that like Cranston, there is a real Henry Arnaud; elderly Isaac Twambley, who first appeared in No Time For Murder; and Fritz, who first appeared in The Living Shadow (April 1931); in this last disguise, he sometimes takes the place of the doddering old slow-witted, uncommunicative janitor who works at Police Headquarters in order to listen in on conversations and to look at evidence.  For the first half of The Shadow's tenure in the pulps, his past and identity are ambiguous. In The Living Shadow, a thug claims to have seen the Shadow's face, and thought he saw \\"a piece of white that looked like a bandage.\\" In The Black Master and The Shadow's Shadow, the villains both see The Shadow's true face and remark that The Shadow is a man of many faces with no face of his own. It was not until the August 1937 issue, The Shadow Unmasks, that The Shadow's real name is revealed.  In the radio drama, the Allard secret identity was dropped for simplicity's sake. On the radio, The Shadow was only Lamont Cranston; he had no other aliases or disguises. Is Cranston a villian?","output":"Based on the quote from the article: \\"In the pulps, Cranston is a separate character; Allard frequently disguises himself as Cranston and adopts his identity (The Shadow Laughs, 1931).\\" Lamont Cranston is not a villain; he is a separate character whose identity is adopted by Kent Allard, aka The Shadow, when Cranston is away."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many yards shorter was the only field goal than the game's opening kickoff?","output":"Title: The Difference in Distance: Comparing a Field Goal and the Opening Kickoff Hey there, little friends! Today, we're going to learn about football and compare two exciting moments in a game – a field goal and an opening kickoff. We will find out how many yards shorter the only field goal in the game was than the game's opening kickoff. First, let's learn about these two moments: 1. Opening Kickoff: This is how a football game begins. One team kicks the ball to the other team, who tries to catch it and run as far as they can. The opening kickoff is usually a pretty long kick – around 60 to 70 yards. 2. Field Goal: This is a way to score points. A team will try to kick the football through a big \\"H\\" called the goalposts. Field goals are usually shorter than kickoffs, and they can be from 20 to 50 yards, depending on where the team is on the field. Now, to find out how many yards shorter the only field goal was than the game's opening kickoff, we need two pieces of information: A. The distance of the opening kickoff in yards B. The distance of the only field goal in yards Once we have these numbers, solving our mystery is simple: subtract the field goal's distance from the opening kickoff's distance like this: Opening Kickoff Distance (A) - Field Goal Distance (B) = Difference in Yards For example, if our opening kickoff was 65 yards and our field goal was 35 yards, we would find the difference like this: 65 (A) - 35 (B) = 30 yards shorter That means the field goal was 30 yards shorter than the opening kickoff! And there you have it, little friends! We've learned how to find the difference between the opening kickoff and the only field goal in a football game. Remember, when comparing distances, all you need is to know the lengths, and then subtract one from the other – it's as easy as 1, 2, 3!

Hayao Miyazaki name became prominent with Spitied Away, however what is often overlooked are director's first film efforts. Who remembers that Spielberg directed Duel or George Lucas directed THX 1138? I remember seeing fragments of this movie - almost certainly the last 45 minutes in late 80s and what stuck with me was the visual lushness of the design and animation. So when I found a copy in a well known store for £9 I couldn't resist but buy it. The odd thing is that the last 45 minutes of the movie do not tally with my memory of it (memory is funny that way). Viewing this movie now with all the gained knowledge of artists portfolios is how very like Jean 'Moebius' Giraud some of the artwork is. I can only assume some influence here. When Pazu catches a falling girl (Sheeta) his adventure really begins - the quest for Laputa - a reference to Jonathan Swift's overlooked portion of Gulliver's Travels. With healthy references to Jules Verne it's a basic good vs. bad chase movie with the final portion having the heroes end up on Laputa. This is the portion that is strongest in my memory - the 'pastoral' ecological aspect of Laputa returned to nature - the multitude of robots covered in moss beneath the giant tree. This is, in my opinion, the highlight of the movie - the views of the surface of Laputa, as opposed to the mechanised underground. Although this is the dichotomy of this movie - to show that even technology cannot overcome nature - the irony of the last robot tending the garden and animals. The ending of the movie Silent Running is almost exactly the same. It is incredibly stylish, I would not say 'slick' - very beautiful and organic and a tremendous amount of detail in the buildings, airships and the design and look of just about everything. Myazaki is a true master of this kind of Japnanese anime. Buy this movie and treasure it. Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative?","output":"The sentiment of this review is positive.

Brian, who had traveled the world, met interesting people, and read countless books, could effortlessly launch into discussions on politics, culture, science, and more.  Step 1: Introduce the reason for Samuel's limited conversational skills In this step, we establish that Samuel's lack of diverse experiences has hindered his ability to engage in various conversation topics in comparison to Brian. Step 2: Provide examples of Brian's experiences Here, we give specific instances – travelling, meeting people, and reading books – which contribute to Brian's extensive knowledge and ability to discuss a wide range of subjects. In an attempt to broaden his scope of knowledge, Samuel decided to follow a structured approach to learning. He would choose a subject each month, exhaustively read books and articles, watch documentaries, and engage with experts on that topic. Step 3: Detail Samuel's plan to improve his conversational skills This step describes the strategy that Samuel implements to expand his understanding of various subjects, ensuring he becomes more well-rounded and able to engage in different conversations. Throughout the following months, Samuel made substantial progress in gaining knowledge across diverse subjects. Slowly but surely, his confidence grew as he found himself able to contribute to discussions on topics ranging from history and philosophy to technology and environmental issues. Step 4: Show the progress and results of Samuel's dedication Here, we showcase Samuel's growth through his commitment to learning, highlighting how he's now able to be part of conversations he once found inaccessible. Samuel realized that learning about different conversation topics not only enabled him to engage in meaningful discussions with others but also enriched his understanding of the world. This newfound knowledge made him eager to continue expanding his horizons, discovering new passions, and ultimately becoming a more well-rounded individual.

Options: - tuna - eaten - rooster - cow - chopped  The answer is \\"rooster\\" because The answer is:","output":"\\"rooster\\" Step-by-step justification: 1. Firstly, let's understand the context of the question. The amateur is dealing with something related to chickens laying eggs. 2. Now, let's examine each of the options:   a. Tuna: Tuna is a fish, and there is no direct correlation between a chicken laying eggs and the presence of a fish.      b. Eaten: In the context of this question, 'eaten' doesn't make sense. Chickens don't lay eggs because they are eaten.      c. Rooster: A rooster is a male chicken. While roosters don't impel hens to lay more eggs, they do play a role in fertilizing eggs and controlling the flock's social order. Therefore, a rooster is indirectly connected with the egg-laying process, and it seems to be the most fitting choice among the given options.      d. Cow: Cows are unrelated to the egg-laying process of chickens, making this option invalid.      e. Chopped: 'Chopped' is also unrelated to the context of the question and doesn't make sense as an answer. 3.

Despite slight differences in the wording, the core message remains consistent in each sentence. In the first sentence, it states that \\"Handspring shareholders will get 0.09 shares of the parent company, Palm, Inc., for each share of Handspring common stock they currently own.\\" Here, the parent company Palm, Inc. is mentioned explicitly, and the concept of \\"getting\\" the shares is used to describe the transaction. In the second sentence, it says that \\"Handspring's shareholders will receive 0.09 Palm shares (and no shares of PalmSource) for each share of Handspring common stock they own.\\" In this case, the focus is more on Palm shares rather than Palm, Inc. as a company, and it also clarifies that no shares of PalmSource will be given. However, the idea of \\"receiving\\" shares instead of \\"getting\\" shares is still essentially the same.

How to identify and care for lionhead goldfish<br>Check the fish you are preparing to buy, or if it is already in your tank, observe it. Lionhead goldfish have the following as physical traits : [substeps] Lionhead goldfish completely lack a stabilizing dorsal fin. If your fish has a dorsal fin, it is most certainly not a lionhead. Can we draw the following conclusion? Lionhead fish do not possess dorsal fins Choose from: (I). Yes; (II). It's impossible to say; (III). No;","output":"I. Yes, we can draw the conclusion that lionhead fish do not possess dorsal fins based on the provided information. To provide more details on identifying and caring for lionhead goldfish, please see the guide below. 1. Identifying Lionhead Goldfish: Lionhead goldfish are relatively easy to identify because of their unique features. Here are some key characteristics to look for: a. As mentioned earlier, lionhead goldfish completely lack a stabilizing dorsal fin. b. They have a distinctive \\"hood\\" or \\"wen\\" that covers their head, giving them a lion-like appearance. This hood can vary in size and shape, but it appears as a fleshy growth and usually starts developing when the fish is around 3-4 months old. c. Their body shape is short, chubby, and deep, with a slightly arched back. d. They have a double caudal (tail) fin, which is large and flowing. 2. Caring for Your Lionhead Goldfish: Lionhead goldfish require proper care and a suitable environment to thrive. Follow these recommendations to ensure their well-being: a. Tank size: Lionhead goldfish grow relatively large (about 6 inches or 15 cm), and they produce a significant amount of waste. Therefore, it's essential to provide a spacious tank – at least 20-30 gallons for the first fish and 10 gallons for each additional lionhead goldfish. b. Filtration and water quality: Lionhead goldfish need clean water and an efficient filtration system. Ensure that your aquarium filter can process all the tank's water at least four times per hour. Maintain appropriate water parameters, including pH (6.0-8.0), temperature (65-75°F or 18-24°C), and avoid ammonia and nitrite spikes. c. Aeration: While goldfish can be somewhat adaptable to lower oxygen levels, it is essential to provide proper aeration in the tank. Use an air stone or an aquarium bubbler to ensure adequate oxygen exchange. d. Décor and substrate: Lionhead goldfish are generally poor swimmers because of their missing dorsal fin and rounded body shape. Keep the tank décor minimal, with plenty of open swimming spaces. Opt for a smooth substrate like sand or smooth gravel to prevent injury. e. Feeding: Feed your lionhead goldfish a balanced diet with specialized pellets and flakes specifically designed for goldfish. Occasionally offer them live or frozen foods like brine shrimp, daphnia, or bloodworms. Provide vegetables such as spinach, peas, or lettuce for extra nutrients. f. Tankmates: Choose tankmates carefully as lionhead goldfish are slow swimmers and can't compete for food with fast or aggressive fish. Suitable tankmates include other goldfish varieties like ranchu or bubble-eye goldfish. Avoid invertebrates, as the goldfish might prey on them. g. Regular maintenance: Clean the tank and perform 25-30% water changes at least every two weeks to maintain water quality. Periodically check and clean the filter as well. h. Monitoring health: Regularly observe your lionhead goldfish for signs of illness or injury, such as lethargy, loss of appetite, or abnormal behavior. Consult a veterinarian or aquatic specialist if you notice any symptoms. By following these guidelines, you'll optimize the health and happiness of your lionhead goldfish."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A: The answer is:","output":"A process that employs microorganisms to consume a pollutant is called \\"bioremediation.\\" Bioremediation is a natural, environmentally-friendly, and cost-effective method of mitigating and degrading various pollutants and waste materials present in the environment, such as soil, water, or air. The method harnesses the natural abilities of certain microorganisms to break down and convert pollutants into less harmful or non-toxic substances. Microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, algae, and certain plants can degrade pollutants like heavy metals, pesticides, petroleum hydrocarbons, and other organic compounds. These microorganisms utilise the pollutants as a source of nutrients or energy, metabolizing them into simpler forms that are less hazardous to the environment and human health. Bioremediation can be classified into two main categories: 1. In-situ bioremediation: This method involves treating the contaminated site directly, without removing the pollutants or the contaminated materials. By employing techniques such as stimulating the growth of microorganisms in the polluted area, through the addition of nutrients or oxygen, or by introducing specific pollutant-degrading microorganisms, in-situ bioremediation can accelerate the natural degradation process. This approach has some advantages, such as minimal soil disruption, lower costs, and reduced risk for secondary pollution. 2. Ex-situ bioremediation: In this method, contaminated materials are physically removed and treated separately from the environment. Ex-situ bioremediation can be further classified into two subcategories: solid phase (e.g., landfarming, biopiles, and composting) and slurry phase (e.g., bioreactors and soil washing). Some of these techniques involve mechanically turning and aerating the contaminated soils, while others focus on treating the soil in a controlled system, such as a bioreactor, where optimal conditions for pollutant degradation can be maintained. Bioremediation has several advantages over other conventional remediation techniques, such as chemical treatments and physical removal, including: - Sustainability: Since bioremediation utilises naturally occurring processes, it has minimal negative impacts on the environment and typically results in more sustainable site rehabilitation. - Cost-effectiveness: Many bioremediation methods have lower operational and disposability costs compared to traditional remediation techniques. - Selectivity: Bioremediation can be tailored to target specific pollutants by choosing microorganisms with the appropriate metabolic capabilities, thus increasing the efficiency of pollution management. However, bioremediation is not without its challenges. Some factors, such as environmental conditions, pollutant type and concentration, and the presence of other toxic compounds, can limit the effectiveness of the bioremediation process. Additionally, it is not always feasible to eliminate all pollutants from the contaminated site completely. Despite these challenges, bioremediation remains an important tool in the fight against pollution and the restoration of polluted sites to a healthy, functional state."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the band member that designed the cover of the 1983 album?, using the article: In 1982, Waters suggested a new musical project with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall. With the onset of the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album. With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure. Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself. Released in March 1983, The Final Cut went straight to number one in the UK and number six in the US. Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the album. Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused. Gilmour later commented: \\"I'm certainly guilty at times of being lazy ... but he wasn't right about wanting to put some duff tracks on The Final Cut.\\" Rolling Stone magazine gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder calling it \\"a superlative achievement ... art rock's crowning..., what would be the answer ? The answer is:","output":"Waters.  The task is to find the last name of the band member who designed the album cover for the 1983 album. According to the article provided, \\"Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself.\\" This means that the band member who designed the cover of the 1983 album is Waters.

Given the below context:  Chat Moss may be named after St Chad, a 7th-century bishop of Mercia, but as it was once part of a great tree-edged lake, as evidenced by the numerous wood remains in the lower levels of the peat, it is perhaps more likely that the name stems from the Celtic word ced, meaning wood. Chat Moss could also derive from Ceatta, an Old English personal name and mos, a swamp or alternatively the first element could be the Old English ceat meaning a piece of wet ground. It was recorded as Catemosse in 1277 and Chatmos in 1322. Moss is the local name for a peat bog.Daniel Defoe visited the area in 1724, on his way from Warrington to Manchester: From hence (Warrington), on the road to Manchester, we pass'd the great bog or waste call'd Chatmos, the first of that kind that we see in England ... The surface, at a distance, looks black and dirty, and is indeed frightful to think of, for it will bear neither horse or man, unless in an exceeding dry season, and then not so as to be passable, or that any one should travel over them ...

What is the answer to this question? when did the tomb of the unknown soldier start?","output":"The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier refers to a monument dedicated to the unidentified servicemen who perished in the line of duty during wars. While there are several tombs of unknown soldiers worldwide, I shall focus on two of the most notable ones: the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in the United States and the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior in the United Kingdom. 1. Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, United States: Located in Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in the United States was established on November 11, 1921. The idea of honoring unidentified soldiers gained momentum in the aftermath of World War I, when a profound sense of grief and recognition of the sacrifice made by so many led to calls for a national memorial. In response to these sentiments, on March 4, 1921, the U.S. Congress approved the burial of an unidentified American soldier from World War I in the plaza of Arlington National Cemetery's new Memorial Amphitheater. An elaborate selection process was created to ensure that the chosen remains genuinely belonged to an unidentified soldier. The selected remains were transported to the United States aboard the USS Olympia, with the interment ceremony taking place on November 11, 1921, also known as Armistice Day (now observed as Veterans Day). Over time, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier has come to represent the sacrifice of not only World War I unknowns but also unidentified soldiers from subsequent wars. Unknown soldiers from World War II and the Korean War were interred in the tomb on May 30, 1958. In 1984, the remains of an unknown soldier from the Vietnam War were also interred; however, in 1998, these remains were exhumed, identified through DNA testing as Air Force 1st Lt. Michael Joseph Blassie, and then reinterred in a cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri. Since then, the Vietnam crypt has remained empty as a symbol of those who were never identified. Since 1937, the tomb has been guarded around the clock by the tomb guards of the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment, also known as \\"The Old Guard.\\" 2. Tomb of the Unknown Warrior, United Kingdom: In the United Kingdom, the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior is located in Westminster Abbey, London. Inspired by Reverend David Railton, an army chaplain who saw a grave marked by a rough wooden cross bearing the inscription \\"An Unknown British Soldier,\\" the concept gained approval, and work began on selecting the unknown warrior. Similar to the process in the United States, the British military ensured the chosen remains were genuinely unidentified. On November 7, 1920, the remains were brought to England from France and interred on November 11, 1920, inside Westminster Abbey. The tomb has since become a revered symbol of remembrance and gratitude for the sacrifices made by all unidentified soldiers who fought in World War I and later conflicts. Since its establishment, several other Commonwealth nations have created similar monuments, making the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior a ubiquitous symbol of honor and appreciation. In summary, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in the United States was established on November 11, 1921, while the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior in the United Kingdom was created slightly earlier on November 11, 1920. These monuments serve as solemn reminders of the sacrifices made by countless unidentified soldiers who fought and died for their nations during times of war."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But the attorney representing Jeremy Irwin and Deborah Bradley, parents of 11-month-old Lisa Irwin, said the couple is not opposed to separate interviews, but do not want what police requested -- an unrestricted interview with no attorneys present.  \\"Being questioned separately is not the issue,\\" said attorney Cyndy Short. She said the couple has been cooperative and has previously been interviewed separately as well as together. They don't mind being interviewed separately as long as the detectives are fair, open-minded and non-accusatory, she said.  Lisa was reported missing about 4 a.m. October 4, after her father, Jeremy Irwin, arrived home from work to find the door unlocked, the lights on and a window that had been tampered with. The girl's mother, Deborah Bradley, said she last saw Lisa at 6:40 p.m. the night before.  Kansas City police Capt. Steve Young said Tuesday investigators had planned to conduct the separate parent interviews, but said Wednesday the couple had declined. Young said he did not dispute reports that the family had cooperated and answered questions, but the police department detectives still had unanswered questions.  Meanwhile, Lisa's half-brothers, who were in the family's home the night she disappeared, will be re-interviewed by authorities on Friday, Kansas City police said Wednesday.

Here are possible answers to this question: - neighbor's house - in phoenix - repair shop - sidewalk - street corner  I believe the correct choice is \\"street corner\\", here's why:","output":"The task involves determining the most likely place a car with its turn signal on would be stopped from the provided options: neighbor's house, in Phoenix, repair shop, sidewalk, and street corner. Let's analyze each option carefully.  1. Neighbor's House: While a car could potentially turn into a neighbor's driveway, the statement doesn't provide enough information to confirm that it was indeed stopped at a neighbor's house. 2. In Phoenix: This option provides a location but doesn't specify a spot where the car could be stopped. Generally, a city or town isn't specific enough to determine the stoppage position of a car with its turn signal on. 3. Repair Shop: The car might need to turn into a repair shop; however, again, the information doesn't directly suggest this is the case.  4. Sidewalk: Cars generally do not stop on sidewalks as it is not a legal or safe place for cars to be. It is designed for pedestrians. Therefore, this seems highly unlikely. 5. Street Corner: Comparatively, a car with its turn signal on is often either about to take a turn or already stopped at a turn. Street corners are common places for cars to be stopped, especially with turn signals on. This can be for reasons like waiting to safely enter into traffic, waiting for pedestrians to cross, or preparing to park. Therefore, given all the available options and the context of the question, the most plausible answer is indeed \\"street corner\\".

In Sheffield, England, young Ruth Beckett & Jimmy Kemp are out in the country above Sheffield when a U.S. F-4 Phantom flies past overhead from the nearby R.A.F. Finningley base. Sheffield, the 4th-largest city in Britain, is close to a prominent R.A.F. Base and also has a major component of steel, energy & chemical production. Jimmy flicks through the car's radio stations, missing a brief news story about a Soviet invasion of Iran in his attempt to find the broadcast of the latest football game. Ruth chastises him for his lack of taste, but after he gets out of the car & comes back with a flower the two start to kiss.Later that week, the BBC runs a story about a Soviet convoy moving through northern Iran. The convoys had apparently been spotted by U.S. satellites, traversing 3 of the mountain passes leading from the USSR. The story goes on to say the Soviet foreign minister had defiantly defended the invasion, and it soon becomes obvious that the Soviets are hoping to convert Iran to yet another Soviet satellite state. During this time frame Ruth also reveals to Jimmy she is pregnant, and wants to keep the baby. When Jimmy informs his parents his father reacts somewhat harshly; his mother tries to point out all the options available to them. Jimmy informs his parents that he & Ruth plan to get married and have the child. Jimmy works for a carpentry firm; it is not clear what Ruth works as. Michael, Jimmy's annoying younger brother, humiliates him in front of his sister Alison by mentioning the upcoming pregnancy, which provokes an angry reaction from both Jimmy and his mother.Soon after, the U.S. states it will send troops to Iran if the USSR doesn't cease its invasion. The Soviets apparently ignore the warning, and soon after U.S. paratroops go in near the Soviet base at Moshad in northern Iran. Hoping the USSR will back off, the British prime minister issues a statement of support for the U.S. action. Unfortunately the USSR ignores the international condemnation, and as Ruth & Jimmy's...

Question: Information:  - The Nordic combined events have been contested at the Winter Olympic Games since 1924. The first competition involved 18 km cross-country skiing, followed by ski jumping. Whoever earned the most points from both competitions won the event. At the 1952 Winter Olympics, the ski jumping was held first, followed by 18 km cross-country skiing. The cross-country skiing portion was reduced to 15 km at the 1956 Winter Olympics. The ski jumping styles would change over the years as well, from the Kongsberger technique after World War I to the Daescher technique in the 1950s to the current V-style from 1985 onwards. The cross-country skiing technique would switch from classical to freestyle for all competitions beginning in 1985, but the biggest change would occur at the 1988 Winter Olympics in the scoring with the Gundersen method, meaning the 15 km cross country portion would go from an interval start race to a pursuit race, so that whoever crossed the finish line first won the event. The team event with a 3 x 10 km cross country relay started at the 1988 Winter Olympics, changing to the current 4 x 5 km cross-country relay at the 1998 Winter Olympics. The 7.5 km sprint event was added at the 2002 Winter Olympics. Nordic combined remains a men's only event as of the 2010 Winter Olympics. For the 2010 Winter Games, the 15 km Individual Gundersen which consisted of 2 jumps from the normal hill followed by 15 km cross country will be replaced by a 10 km individual normal hill event which will consist of one jump from the individual normal hill following by 10 km of cross country using the Gundersen system while the 7.5 km sprint will be replaced by the 10 km individual large hill event.  - Geir Andersen ( born February 12 , 1964 ) is a Norwegian nordic combined skier who competed from 1983 to 1989 . He won three medals at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships with one gold ( 1984 : 3 x 10 km team ) and two silvers ( 1985 : 15 km individual , 3 x 10 km team ) . Andersen also finished 10th in the individual event at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo . He had six individual victories in his career from 1984 to 1985 .  - Nordic combined is a winter sport in which athletes compete in cross-country skiing and ski jumping. Nordic combined at the Winter Olympics and the FIS Nordic Combined World Cup are ongoing.  - The FIS Nordic Combined World Cup is a Nordic combined competition organized yearly by FIS, representing the highest level in international competition for this sport. It was first arranged for the 1983/84 season. Team event was first time held in 1999/00 season. The FIS race director is a Norwegian ex ski jumper and ex world record holder Lasse Ottesen.  - A winter sport or winter activity is a recreational activity or sport which is played during cold weather months. Most such sports are variations of skiing, ice skating and sledding. Traditionally such sports were only played in cold areas during winter, but artificial snow and artificial ice allow more flexibility. Artificial ice can be used to provide ice rinks for ice skating, ice hockey and bandy in a milder climate.  - The FIS Nordic World Ski Championships have been held in various numbers and types of events since 1925 for men and since 1954 for women. Championship events include nordic skiing's three disciplines: cross-country skiing, ski jumping, and nordic combined (the latter being a combination sport consisting of both cross-country and ski jumping). From 1924 to 1939, the World Championships were held every year, including the Winter Olympics. After World War II, the World Championships were held every four years from 1950 to 1982. Since 1985, the World Championships have been held in odd-numbered years.  - Nordic skiing pertains to skiing disciplines that use equipment where the toe of the ski boot is fixed to the binding in a manner that allows the heel to rise off the ski, unlike Alpine skiing, where the boot is attached to the ski from toe to heel. Recreational disciplines include cross-country skiing and Telemark skiing.  - Ski jumping is a form of Nordic skiing in which athletes descend a specially constructed takeoff ramp (known as the \\"inrun\\"), jump from the end of it (the \\"table\\") with as much power as they can generate, and \\"fly\\" as far as possible down a steeply sloped hill. Points are awarded for distance and style by five judges, with competition sanctioned by the International Ski Federation (FIS). To enable the athletes (who are known as \\"ski jumpers\\") to effectively glide such long distances and land safely, the skis they use are considerably wider and longer than their cross-country and alpine skiing counterparts. Ski jumping is predominantly a winter sport and has been part of the Winter Olympic Games since its inception in 1924 for men and since 2014 for women. Since 1954 it is possible to ski jump in summer on artificial surfaces made from plastic. Along with cross-country skiing, ski jumping is one of two sports which form the Nordic combined discipline. Holmenkollbakken in Oslo is the holy place of this sport, which is most popular in Austria, Germany, Finland, Japan, Norway, Poland and Slovenia.

The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) closely resembled severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in disease manifestation as rapidly progressive acute pneumonia with multi-organ dysfunction. Using monocyte-derived-dendritic cells (Mo-DCs), we discovered fundamental discrepancies in the outcome of MERS-CoV-and SARS-CoV-infection. First, MERS-CoV productively infected Mo-DCs while SARS-CoV-infection was abortive. Second, MERS-CoV induced significantly higher levels of IFN-γ, IP-10, IL-12, and RANTES expression than SARS-CoV. Third, MERS-CoV-infection induced higher surface expression of MHC class II (HLA-DR) and the co-stimulatory molecule CD86 than SARS-CoV-infection. Overall, our data suggests that the dendritic cell can serve as an important target of viral replication and a vehicle for dissemination. MERS-CoV-infection in DCs results in the production of a rich combination of cytokines and chemokines, and modulates innate immune response differently from that of SARS-CoV-infection.

(CNN) -- A Christian evangelical group said Thursday that a Bible school -- backed by American evangelist Franklin Graham -- was destroyed in the latest bombing raid to hit South Kordofan, an oil-rich Sudanese province that borders the newly created independent country of South Sudan. At least eight bombs were dropped in the area Wednesday during the school's first day of classes, according to a statement by Samaritan's Purse, Graham's Christian humanitarian group, which supports the school. Two bombs landed inside the compound -- located in the region's Nuba Mountains -- destroying two Heiban Bible College buildings and igniting grass fires across the area, the group said in a statement No injuries were reported. \\"It was a miracle that no one was injured,\\" the statement added. Graham, who has called on the international community to take out Sudan's air assets and establish a no-fly zone in the region, said in a statement Thursday that he blamed Sudan's air force for the strike. At least four churches have been destroyed since August, the group said. \\"We are deeply concerned for the welfare and lives of the people of South Kordofan and we condemn the bombing of churches and Christian facilities,\\" added Graham, son of the famed Rev. Billy Graham. More than 78,000 people have fled South Kordofan and Blue Nile states since August of last year after an armed rebellion took root, the United Nations reported. The Sudanese government is thought to have responded to the rebellion by conducting sustained air raids with the use of Russian-made Antonov bombers, which have raised concerns over civilian casualties. Decades of civil war between the north and south, costing as many as 2 million lives, formally ended with a U.S.-brokered peace treaty in 2005.

Summarize this article: If you purchase a breastfeeding pillow before your baby arrives you can use it to provide relief from pains and discomforts during pregnancy.  Tucking the breastfeeding pillow between bent knees during sleep offers lower back support. You can also tuck the pillow behind your back to help you stay on your side while sleeping.  If you have pregnancy related heartburn, you can use an extra pillow to raise your head while sleeping. Tummy time is a routine in which a baby is placed on his tummy for a little bit each day. The purpose of tummy time is to strengthen a baby's neck muscles and teach him how to push, roll over, crawl, and stand. Breastfeeding pillows can be used to enhance tummy time.  Most baby's sleep on their backs, in accordance to standards laid out by the American Academy of Pediatricians in 1992. This is to prevent sudden infant death syndrome. As babies spend so much time on their backs rather than their stomachs, tummy time can be stressful. Babies might resist being forced on their stomach.  A breastfeeding pillow can help ease your baby into tummy time. Propping a baby up on a pillow can give him a new perspective and allow him to see more of a room. This can distract him from the discomfort of being on his belly, and prevent crying and distress during tummy time.  Make sure you don't prop your baby up using a breastfeeding pillow before 3 or 4 months, as his neck muscles might not be strong enough for this to be safe until then. Breastfeeding pillows can be a great tool, but they do not work for every mother.  Sometimes, a breastfeeding pillow can result in your baby having difficulty latching. Some babies do not take to breastfeeding and prefer to be held, resulting in them becoming fussy or difficult to nurse when using the pillow.  Nursing pillows are bulky and can be difficult to take from place to place. Some others also report having to lean over the pillows and experiencing back aches because of this.  Remember, a nursing pillow is designed to provide you added comfort. Some women find the pillow to be helpful to them and their babies, but if a breastfeeding pillow causes you discomfort it's not a necessity. Old fashioned breastfeeding is fine if you don't feel comfortable with a breastfeeding pillow. Summary:","output":"Breastfeeding pillows can serve multiple purposes before and after your baby's birth. They can provide relief for pregnancy-related pains and discomfort, such as lower back support when sleeping, and can also be used for tummy time to strengthen a baby's neck muscles. However, the baby should only be propped on the pillow after 3-4 months. While the pillows can be convenient, they may not suit everyone, sometimes causing difficulties in baby latching and causing discomfort due to their bulkiness.

Photo: REUTERS/Robert Galbraith      Facebook Inc. is inching closer to an initial public offering that it hopes will value the company at more than 100 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.      The social networking firm is now targeting a time frame of April to June 2012 for an initial public offering, said people familiar with the matter. The company is exploring raising 10 billion in its IPO—what would be one of the largest offerings ever—in a deal that might assign Facebook a 100 billion valuation, a number greater than twice that of such stalwarts as Hewlett-Packard Co. and 3M Co.      How much will Facebook be worth once it files for its anticipated-IPO? Facebook is exploring raising 10 billion in an IPO that could value Facebook at more than 100 billion, Spencer Ante reports on Markets Hub. Photo: Reuters.      A Facebook IPO has been hotly anticipated for several years, and viewed as a defining moment for the latest Web investing boom. The company has been vague about whether it would even make such an offering and silent on timing of an IPO. \\"We're not going to participate in speculation about an IPO,\\" said Facebook spokesman Larry Yu.      The company now appears poised to go ahead with a deal. But it will likely come to market at a time when investors are beginning to question the value of some newer Internet businesses.      The most recent IPO, an 805 million float of discount-deal service Groupon Inc. on Nov. 3, has plummeted 42% in price in the past five trading days after surging in its first day of trading. Business-networking service LinkedIn Corp., whose stock more than doubled from its IPO price on its first day of trading May 19, has since fallen 36%, but remains 33% above its IPO.      Enlarge Image Close Reuters CEO Mark Zuckerberg is said to be warming to the idea of an IPO.      IPO: Go, No-Go? Initial public offerings aren't always good investments. Here's a look at some of the high-fliers and flame-outs of the Internet era View Interactive More photos and interactive graphics      Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has in the past publicly expressed reluctance to do an IPO. And he has opted to keep Facebook private longer than many suspected he would.      But he is warming to the idea. Facebook is now in internal discussions over the timing of its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is considering filing dates as early as this year, said these people. Mr. Zuckerberg hasn't made any final decisions, these people cautioned.      Facebook remains aloof from Wall Street and shows signs of wanting to play by its own rules.      Companies often explore an IPO once they have 100 million in revenue. Facebook is expected to debut with more than 4 billion in revenue, making it bigger than Web veteran Yahoo Inc.      Facebook has gone so far as to craft its own prospectus, said the people familiar with the matter. A prospectus document—which is filed with the SEC outlining the company's business—is typically prepared by bankers and lawyers hired by a company.      Facebook Chief Financial Officer David Ebersman has been leading the company's talks with Silicon Valley bankers about an IPO, said people familiar with the matter.      Bankers are aggressively pursuing the company, but Facebook remains elusive about a commitment to specific banks, even though an IPO looms. Mr. Ebersman told some bankers that he is skeptical over what contribution investment banks could make to a Facebook IPO, since the company is so highly sought after by major investors, said people familiar with the matter.      The social network, which was started by Mr. Zuckerberg in 2004 out of his Harvard University dorm room, has led the way in reshaping how people share information and interact with others on the Web. It now counts 800 million users, with 500 million users logging into the site daily.      Facebook will be required to make its financial information public by April, because the company will cross the 500-shareholder limit by the end of this year. The SEC requires companies with more than 500 shareholders to publicly disclose its financial information.      Facebook's Growing Ambitions See key dates in the history of the social network. View Interactive      Facebook could publish its financial information come April without an IPO, but board members and top executives have privately acknowledged that it would leave the company at a severe disadvantage, since they would have most of the liability that comes with being a public company, but lose out on the fundraising benefits of a public offering, said these people.      Only 13 IPOs have ever been completed with a value greater than 10 billion, and just three of those have been for U.S. companies, according to Dealogic, which tracks new securities issues. The only U.S. issuers at that size level have been Visa Inc. at 19.7 billion in 2008; General Motors Co. at 18.1 billion in 2010; and AT&T Wireless Services Inc. at 10.6 billion in 2000.      The most valuable company ever to go public was Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, which sold 21.9 billion of stock in October 2006 and finished its first day of trading with a market value of 148 billion, Dealogic said.      A Facebook offering of 10 billion would be the largest IPO by any technology or Internet company. The largest U.S. Internet IPO, the 1.9 billion sale in 2004 by Google Inc. which valued Google at 23 billion, ranks No. 3 among global Internet IPOs.      Facebook's revenue is driven by its online advertising business, as big brands rush to the site to interact with consumers through display ads and fan pages. Facebook's world-wide ad revenue is expected to hit 3.8 billion this year, up from 1.86 billion a year earlier, according to data compiled by eMarketer. Facebook's share of display ad revenue in the US is expected to grow to 16.3% in 2011 and 19.5% in 2012, eMarketer found.      —Randall Smith contributed to this article.      Write to Shayndi Raice at shayndi.raice@wsj.com ||||| Facebook's initial public offering has been the source of Wall Street speculation for months. Some thought the IPO would come this year, others have reported that it wouldn't arrive until late next year.      And on Monday, the Wall Street Journal added fuel to the Facebook IPO fire with a report that the world's largest social network, with more than 800 million users, is prepping to issue its first public stock offering in the second quarter of 2012.      The Facebook IPO could be a 10-billion offering based on a 100-billion valuation of the Palo Alto-based company. But as to when in the second quarter the IPO would come, well that hasn't yet been decided, the Journal said in its report, citing unnamed \\"people familiar with the matter.\\"      As reported by my colleague Walter Hamilton over on our sister-blog Money & Company:      The timing of Facebook's IPO is likely to hinge in part on the condition of the stock market, which has not been kind lately to some other prominent tech IPOs. In a major disappointment, shares of one of this year's most closely watched IPOs, online-coupon company Groupon Inc., have plunged recently. The stock closed Monday at 15.24, far below the 20 price at which it sold shares to investors earlier this month.      Earlier this month, Facebook co-Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on a PBS interview with Charlie Rose that indeed, his company was planning an IPO, but that the company hadn't yet decided when.      Zuckerberg also said that an IPO isn't something he spent \\"a lot of time on a day-to-day basis thinking about.\\"      \\"We've made this implicit promise to our investors and to our employees that by compensating them with equity and by giving them equity, that at some point we're going to make that equity worth something publicly and liquidly, in a liquid way,\\" he said. \\"Now, the promise isn't that we're going to do it on any kind of short-term time horizon. The promise is that we're going to build this company so that it's great over the long term, right. And that we're always making these decisions for the long term, but at some point we'll do that.\\"      RELATED:      Facebook close to privacy settlement with FTC      Mark Zuckerberg says Steve Jobs advised him on Facebook      Zuckerberg: If I started Facebook today, I would stay in Boston      -- Nathan Olivarez-Giles      Twitter.com/nateog      Photo: Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg walks around Harvard University in Cambridge on Nov. 7, 2011.

This decision was made after carefully considering the effectiveness, efficiency, and practicality of both methods. The sift, which is a simple tool consisting of a mesh screen supported by a frame, was chosen for its ability to provide a more precise and hands-on approach to filtering the sand. Additionally, using the sift allowed for better control over the process, enabling the filtering to be done more gently and preserving the sand's natural qualities. On the other hand, the complexity and bulkiness of the machine made it difficult to operate and maneuver in the specific location where the sand needed to be filtered. The machine's unwieldiness also increased the risk of damaging the surrounding environment, which was an essential factor to consider in this particular sand-filtering mission. Furthermore, the sift's lower cost and maintenance requirements were highly appealing when compared to the more expensive and sophisticated machine. The sift's simplicity also meant that it could be more easily transported to the sand-filtering site and stored when not in use, making it a more convenient tool for the task at hand. However, it's worth mentioning that there are specific situations where the machine might be the better choice for sand filtering. For instance, in large-scale operations requiring the rapid filtering of vast amounts of sand, the increased speed and efficiency of the machine might outweigh its unwieldy nature. Additionally, the machine might be better suited to locations with limited access to manual labor or where the sand's natural qualities aren't a priority. In conclusion, the sand was filtered using the sift instead of the machine because of its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and superiority in preserving the sand's natural qualities. It also provided better control over the process and reduced the risk of environmental damage. While the machine does have its benefits in certain scenarios, its unwieldy nature ultimately made it a less practical choice in this case."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He describes his date, Corporal Kelsey DeSantis, as “so humble and honest...

As for DeSantis’ reaction? Fox News reports that she tweeted, “The ball was epic!

Expand this summary.","output":"Pop singer and actor Justin Timberlake not only had the honor of attending the Marine Corps Ball, but he was also moved by the experience to such an extent that he shared a heartfelt tribute on his official website. Known for his chart-topping music and impressive acting abilities, Timberlake added another dimension to his public persona by displaying sincere appreciation for the US Marines and the values they embody. The event took place on Saturday night and was highlighted by Timberlake's heartfelt tribute that, surprisingly, even touched the notoriously cynical editors at Gawker. As he attended the gala, Timberlake found himself deeply moved by the whole event. Despite expecting it to be an evening he wouldn't soon forget, the magnitude of the impact took him by surprise. He had anticipated having a wonderful time and accumulating some great stories to tell his friends. However, it turned out to be far more profound than that. Timberlake, in his detailed account, gave particular emphasis to his date, Corporal Kelsey DeSantis. The young Marine struck him as being incredibly humble and honest, traits he highly appreciated. He described her as being 'very cool', but also noted her apprehension about the night. Intriguingly, despite being in the company of a mega celebrity, she was more concerned about whether Timberlake was enjoying himself and feeling comfortable. Observing this care and selflessness, the singer was struck by the realization that these were the same sort of individuals who safeguard American freedom. He was touched by their humility and their propensity to place the welfare of others above their own. Timberlake encouraged his fans and followers to read the entire account, citing its emotional depth and inspirational value. Corporal DeSantis responded to Timberlake's tribute by expressing her delight about the night. Fox News reported that she took to Twitter to state, “The ball was epic! Had a wonderful time.” In a relate update, fans were also concerned about actress Mila Kunis' promise of attending her own Marine Corps Ball date. New York confirmed that she had plans to attend hers the following Friday. The news considerably allayed fans who were worried she might not be able to make it. In conclusion, the star-studded event not only served as a memorable night for the attendees but also shed light on the humility and selflessness of the marines. Timberlake's tribute painted a profound picture of these brave individuals, offering the public a different perspective on these often-underappreciated heroes. Through this, the singer used his platform to foster greater understanding and appreciation for the people who devote their lives to safeguarding the freedoms we often take for granted."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: FINAL EXAM  Question 1. Who managed the 5,000 acre estate of Thomas Jefferson? The answer is:","output":"The 5,000-acre estate of Thomas Jefferson, known as Monticello, was primarily managed by Jefferson himself. However, there were overseers and other individuals who assisted in the management of the plantation throughout Jefferson's life. One of the most notable overseers was Edmund Bacon, who worked at Monticello from 1806 to 1822. Jefferson was a hands-on owner and paid close attention to the plantation's operations, which included growing various crops, maintaining the estate, and overseeing his many enslaved workers. These enslaved workers contributed significantly to the management and maintenance of the estate, working in the fields, tending to animals, and performing various skilled labor tasks such as blacksmithing and woodworking. Enslaved individuals who held positions of responsibility on the plantation include Ishmael, who oversaw agricultural activities, and head gardener Wormley Hughes. In summary, Thomas Jefferson managed his 5,000-acre estate, Monticello, with the assistance of overseers like Edmund Bacon and the labor of enslaved workers, who played a major role in the daily operations and maintenance of the estate."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Syriana swept the critics upon release and everything seemed to be raving about it. I suppose it's one of those films that is intensely intelligent...so intelligent that I think you need to be well versed in the oil industry and a politically brilliant mind. I don't consider myself unintelligent, I've been studying politics since my early teens and I enjoy an intelligent film but for the most part unless it's a documentary films are meant to be primarily entertaining as well as have a message. Syriana tried to be strictly intelligent and it does turn some people away. I would even go so far as to say that those who rave about it and insist it's a 10/10 are lying because they think they look better. This film was the most confusing, senseless, mindless dribble I have seen in awhile...Especially considering the critical acclaim, the Oscar nods, and the cast. Screenplay writer Stephen Gaghan has disappointed me yet again. His horribly written Havoc preceded this film and I think he's just trying way too hard. I can't believe he was offered the opportunity to write the Da Vinci Code screenplay. On top of that Gaghan directed the film which made it an absolute mess. I had no idea who anyone was, why things were happening, who was who and what was what. It was a disaster. Because I don't really know who anyone was I can only mention the actors and what I thought of their performances because despite the horrendously complicated script the actors did alright. George Clooney plays C.I.A. field agent and assassin I think?? Bob Barnes. Clooney has never been a favorite of mine but lately he's managed to churn out some decent performances and this seemed to be a pretty good performance on his part. Barnes was a complex character with a sordid history and if I knew what was going on with him I would have really enjoyed his character. Matt Damon plays Bryan Woodman and he is rather bland and always looks like a deer in the headlights which I can understand his confusion after reading this script and then trying to perform it. Amanda Peet plays his wife and she does well in the few scenes she is given. Christopher Plummer makes a cameo appearance as someone doing something. I like Plummer and love seeing him show up even if he doesn't get top billing anymore. The cast is intense if only the story made sense. I'd like to exact quote the description of plot on IMDb. \\"A missile disappears in Iran, but the CIA has other problems: the heir to an Emirate gives an oil contract to China, cutting out a US company that promptly fires its immigrant workers and merges with a small firm that has landed a Kazakhstani oil contract. The Department of Justice suspects bribery, and the oil company's law firm finds a scapegoat. The CIA also needs one when its plot to kill the Emir-apparent fails. Agent Bob Barnes, the fall guy, sorts out the double cross. An American economist parlays the death of his son into a contract to advise the sheik the CIA wants dead. The jobless Pakistanis join a fundamentalist group. All roads start and end in the oil fields.\\" WHAT!?!? Say who now?? Syriana might be the thinking man's movie but it bored me to tears and no matter how hard I tried to stay with it I eventually surrendered and turned it off after an hour and a half and you couldn't have bribed me enough to get me to finish it.

The victory at Gleneagles, where Europe won 16 1/2 to 11 1/2, marked their eighth triumph in the past ten attempts. Despite this recent success, in the grand scheme of the Ryder Cup history, the United States holds the overall lead. Europe trails with 12 victories compared to America's 25, highlighting that there is still much work to be done for Europe to close this gap. In fact, it was this very divide that captain Paul McGinley employed as a motivating factor for his team during the week. He presented a graphic that showed the stark contrast between the number of victories for each side. Through this, McGinley sought to inspire his team to not let their guard down, and to keep pushing further to equalize the records and eradicate the disparity. As Rory McIlroy played a significant role in Europe's spectacular win at the Ryder Cup, he remains adamant that this golfing event will continue to be a major sporting spectacle between two very competitive teams. It's this intense competition and rivalry that fuels the desire of both sides to perform at their best. The Northern Irishman acknowledges that Europe has had the upper hand over the United States in the past few years; however, this doesn't mean that the US won't stage a strong comeback and secure a few victories over the next five to six years. The Ryder Cup is an incredible showcase of talent, skill, and sportsmanship between two powerhouse teams: Europe and the United States. Although Europe has seen more success recently, the US should not be underestimated as they strive to regain their position atop golf's most celebrated team event. The fierce competition and camaraderie exhibited at the Ryder Cup will endure, regardless of either side's dominance, making it an unparalleled experience for both players and fans alike."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and answer the question. Article: A mouse looked through a crack in the wall to see the farmer and his wife opening a package: What food might it contain? He was astonished to discover that it was a mouse trap! Retreating to the farmyard, the mouse declared the warning, \\"There is a mouse trap in the house, there is a mouse trap in the house.\\" The chicken clucked and scratched, raised her head and said, \\"Mr Mouse, I can tell you this is a grave concern to you, but it is of no consequence to me, I cannot be bothered by it.\\" The mouse turned to the pig and told him, \\"There is a mouse trap in the house.\\" \\"I am so sorry, Mr Mouse,\\" sympathized the pig, \\"but there is nothing I can do about it but pray; be assured that you are in my prayers.\\" The mouse turned to the cow, who replied, \\"A mouse trap, am I in grave danger, huh?\\" So the mouse returned to the house, head down and depressed to face the farmer's mouse trap alone. That very night a sound was heard throughout the house, like the sound of a mouse trap catching its prey. The farmer's wife rushed to see what was caught. In the darkness, she did not see that it was an evil snake whose tail the trap had caught. The snake bit the farmer's wife. The farmer rushed her to the hospital. She returned home with a fever. Now everyone knew to treat a fever with fresh chicken soup, so the farmer took his hatchet to the farmyard for the soup's main _ .

In other cases, fresh is still the way to go. Here's your guide to making the best picks now. Blueberries. Buy 'em: Frozen. Frozen blueberries are typically the petite wild version, which have been found by scientists to contain more disease-thwarting antioxidants than their traditionally cultivated counterparts (the type you're most likely to find fresh right now). Also, fresh blueberries are pricey in winter and, if trucked in from afar, can go moldy fast. Health.com: The best superfoods for weight loss. Apples. Buy 'em: Fresh. Apples are a top-notch source of quercetin, an antioxidant shown to slash the risk for certain cancers. And quercetin levels in a fresh apple hold up even if it was picked months ago and put into cold storage until the winter, a \\"Nutrition Journal\\" study suggests. Nearly all of the fruit's quercetin and half its fiber is found in the peel -- which you'll get with fresh apples but usually not with dried. (Opt for certified organic, if possible, to avoid pesticides on the fruit's exterior.) Health.com: 10 healthy apple pie and cake recipes. Peaches. Buy 'em: Frozen. When it comes to juicy goodness, winter peaches from South America are mere shadows of the fresh, locally sourced summer version. They're also about twice the price. They're not as good for you, either: \\"Peaches can lose a considerable amount of their nutrients, including potassium, during multi-country shipping,\\" says Cynthia Sass, R.D., author of \\"Cinch! Conquer Cravings, Drop Pounds and Lose Inches\\". Frozen peaches, on the other hand, are harvested at peak ripeness and quickly flash-frozen to lock in vitamins, antioxidants, and flavor. Health.com: Vitamins: what to take, what to skip. Strawberries. Buy 'em: Fresh. Fresh or frozen, strawberries are a leading source of vitamin C, but let's face it: The texture of frozen strawberries leaves something to be desired. What's more, compared to other berries, fresh strawberries remain reasonably priced throughout the winter. Consider splurging on organic, though, since conventionally grown strawberries contain some of the highest pesticide levels of any fruit, according to the Environmental Working Group. Health.com: 11 things it's best to buy organic. Plums. Buy 'em: Dried. By the time winter plums find their way to the U.S. (from as far away as South America) and potentially sit on store shelves for days, they often have yucky soft spots. Meanwhile, ounce for ounce, dried plums (you know them as prunes) pack five times the fiber and vitamin K -- a nutrient necessary for proper blood clotting -- as the fresh kind. Eating prunes can also bolster bone strength, researchers at Florida State University have found. Health.com: Foods for healthy bones. Cherries. Buy 'em: Dried. Sweet Bing cherries are highly susceptible to bruising during international winter shipping, and your wallet may be bruised by their high winter price. They also lag behind tart cherries -- the version most often found dried -- in levels of vitamin C and beta-carotene. \\"Beta-carotene is a building block for vitamin A, so it helps maintain healthy skin, bones, and immunity,\\" Somer says. Removing the moisture also makes dried tart cherries particularly concentrated in anthocyanins, which are potent antioxidants, she adds.

Article: The state Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that documents and journals belonging to Sandy Hook Elementary School shooter Adam Lanza will be released to the public, a key victory in the Hartford Courant’s five-year battle to obtain the information.      The Courant requested access to the documents that state police removed from the Yogananda Street home in Newtown where Lanza killed his mother Nancy Lanza before driving to the school and killing 26 people, including 20 first graders, before killing himself.      In a unanimous decision, the court ordered a lower court judge to reverse himself and deny the state’s appeal of a Freedom of Information Commission decision that ordered the items released.      “Since the day of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, the Courant has worked to advance the understanding of how so heinous a tragedy could happen and we applaud today’s decision as we feel these documents are necessary for us to tell a complete story in our reporting,” said Andrew Julien, the Courant’s publisher and editor-in-chief. “Understanding what a mass killer was thinking not only paints a clearer picture of the individual, it helps us identify and understand red flags that could be part of a prevention formula for future mass shootings.”      The state attorney general’s office declined comment Tuesday. The state could ask the Connecticut Supreme Court to reconsider or ask the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case.      The court rejected several arguments the attorney general’s office made to keep the records sealed, including that the documents seized were the property of the judicial department, were the private property of Nancy and Adam Lanza and shouldn’t be considered public documents because they were seized through a search warrant and never used as evidence in a criminal case.      Among the documents to which the newspaper sought access were a spreadsheet that Lanza kept on his computer of other mass killers going back to at least the 1970s, journals that he wrote, and other items removed from his bedroom during a second search of the house in the days following the Dec, 14, 2012, massacre.      Supreme Court Justices Grill Attorneys In Sandy Hook Records Case »      The records were described in a state police report released a year after the school shooting. The Courant requested access to the records under the state's Freedom of Information Act, but police declined to release them.      The newspaper filed a complaint with the Freedom of Information Commission and won, but the state police appealed to Superior Court, where Judge Carl J. Schuman overruled the commission, setting up the Supreme Court battle.      Gunman Kills 26 At Sandy Hook School In Newtown »      In oral arguments before the court last March, an assistant attorney general representing the state police urged the court to keep the records secret, asking the justices to uphold the ruling of a Superior Court judge who declared the material was private property exempt from the disclosure mandates of Connecticut's public-records laws.      Assistant Attorney General Steven Barry told the justices that state laws governing seized evidence establish strict protocols for handling property taken involuntarily by search warrant, and said the legislature could not have intended the public to have \\"unfettered access\\" to the property, even when not used in a criminal action.      In addition to the spreadsheet and booklet, police seized hand-drawn comics, school records and a screenplay featuring a relationship between a 10-year-old boy and a 30-year-old man.      Lanza Had Arsenal Of Guns, Ammunition, Swords, Knives »      The legal question for the justices turned on whether the state's search-and-seizure laws supersede the Freedom of Information Act. But there was a practical element as well, with The Courant arguing that release of the records could help the public understand the ruthless attack on the elementary school, and the state police arguing that a ruling in The Courant's favor could expose financial records or a private diary.      During arguments in the case, several justices challenged Barry's assertion that the laws covering search warrants were in conflict with the Freedom of Information Act and in his written opinion Justice Raheem L. Mullins said the law was silent on the issue.      “The trial court pointed to nothing in the express terms of the search and seizure statutes that creates confidentiality in the documents or otherwise limits the disclosure, copying, or distribution of the documents,” Mullins wrote. “Indeed, the search and seizure statutes are silent on the issues of confidentiality, copying, or disclosure to the public.”      The court also rejected the argument that the documents were private property and should not be disclosed since they were seized from the Lanza home.      “Even if we agree with the trial court that the search and seizure statutes protect the ownership rights of the people whose property has been seized, we cannot conclude that a statutory scheme requiring that property be returned to its owners creates a duty of confidentiality for those items or otherwise limits public disclosure,” Mullins wrote.      State police declined to release the documents, arguing that statutes covering search warrants treat the material as private property that may be used only for limited law-enforcement purposes. On that basis, the police pointed to a portion of the Freedom of Information Act that makes records subject to disclosure unless \\"otherwise provided by any federal law or state statute.\\"      Uncredited / ASSOCIATED PRESS A photo of Adam Lanza's bedroom where state police recovered journals, computer records and other documents that have never been released to the public.

(Uncredited / ASSOCIATED PRESS)      The Freedom of Information Commission rejected that argument, concluding that records may be withheld under that provision only if a competing federal or state law explicitly provides for the confidentiality of the records.

Some... (Associated Press)      HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Some of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooter's personal belongings, including personal journals containing stories about hurting children and a spreadsheet ranking mass murders, must be released to the public because they are not exempt from open record laws, the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled Tuesday.      Thousands of documents already have been released from the investigation that ended without determining a motive for the massacre of 20 first-graders and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School on Dec. 14, 2012, but the writings could provide insights into the thinking of the shooter, Adam Lanza.      The Hartford Courant and other media organizations requested to view Lanza's belongings, which were seized by authorities during a search of Lanza's home and described in a state police report released about a year after the shooting. State police rejected the requests, citing privacy rights in the state's search and seizure law.      The Courant appealed to the state Freedom of Information Commission, which in 2015 ordered state police to release the documents. But Superior Court Judge Carl Schuman overruled the commission in 2016 — a decision overturned Tuesday in the 5-0 Supreme Court ruling.      \\"We feel these documents are necessary to tell a complete story in our reporting,\\" said Andrew Julien, publisher and editor-in-chief of the Courant. \\"Understanding what a mass killer was thinking not only paints a clearer picture of the individual, it helps us identify and understand red flags that could be part of a prevention formula for future mass shootings.\\"      It's not immediately clear when the 35 requested items will be released. The state attorney general's office, which represents state police and declined to comment Tuesday, could ask the Supreme Court to reconsider its ruling or possibly appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. State police officials did not return messages seeking comment.      Among the disputed documents are a spreadsheet ranking mass murders by name and number killed and a notebook titled \\"The Big Book of Granny.\\" The notebook contains a story that Lanza wrote in the fifth grade about a woman who uses her \\"rifle cane\\" to kill people.      Police also so far have not released an eight-page document titled simply, \\"me,\\" which was described in a police inventory as \\"detailing relationships, ideal companion, culture, voting, personal beliefs, describes doctors touching children as rape.\\" Another, named \\"tomorrow,\\" apparently contains details about the author's \\"desires, list of the benefits of being thin and negative connotations associated with being overweight, list of goals ...\\".      Some of the other requested items include a folder containing hand-drawn, comic-style pictures and stories about Pokemon-type characters; a packet of educational materials from the Sandy Hook school to Lanza's mother including report cards and an educational plan addressing his mental health issues; a list of problems and requests from Lanza to his mother; and a story about a relationship between a 10-year-old boy and a 20-year-old man.      A report by the Connecticut child advocate said Lanza's severe and deteriorating mental health problems, his preoccupation with violence and access to his mother's weapons \\"proved a recipe for mass murder.\\"      Lanza's medical and school records included references to diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder, the child advocate's office said. The 2014 report said Nancy Lanza backed her son's resistance to medication and from the 10th grade on kept him at home, where he was surrounded by an arsenal of firearms and spent long hours playing violent video games.      In Tuesday's court decision, Justice Raheem Mullins wrote that the court must \\"narrowly construe\\" language in state law that allows exceptions to public disclosure, and that \\"otherwise any statute governing an agency's general treatment of records becomes a possible restriction on disclosure.\\"      \\"The trial court pointed to nothing in the express terms of the search and seizure statutes that creates confidentiality in the documents or otherwise limits the disclosure, copying, or distribution of the documents,\\" wrote Mullins. \\"Indeed, the search and seizure statutes are silent on the issues of confidentiality, copying, or disclosure to the public.\\" |||||Summary:","output":"The Connecticut Supreme Court ruled that documents and journals belonging to Sandy Hook Elementary School shooter Adam Lanza will be released to the public.

Question: Information:  - Post-hardcore is a punk rock music genre that derives from hardcore punk, maintaining hardcore's aggression and intensity, but emphasizes a greater degree of creative expression initially inspired by post-punk and noise rock. Like post-punk, the term has been applied to a broad constellation of groups. The genre took shape in the mid to late 1980s with releases by bands from cities that had established hardcore scenes, such as Fugazi from Washington, D.C. as well as groups such as Big Black and Jawbox that stuck closer to post-hardcore's noise rock roots.  - Q and Not U was a post-hardcore band from Washington, D.C., signed to Dischord Records. Members John Davis, Harris Klahr, Christopher Richards, and Matt Borlik formed the band in 1998. After Borlik's departure following the release of their first album, the band went on to record two more critically acclaimed LPs as a three-piece, exploring aspects of dance-punk, and other disparate musical styles. Q and Not U disbanded in September 2005 after completing their touring commitments and a short farewell stand at Washington, D.C. venue The Black Cat.  - Dance-punk (also known as disco-punk or punk funk) is a music genre that emerged in the late 1970s, and is closely associated with the post-punk and new wave movements.  - Power was the 3rd and final album by Q and Not U. It was released on October 5 , 2004 . After touring in support of the album , the group disbanded in September 2005 . The album was co-produced by Pete Cafarella and Rafael Cohen ( of Supersystem ) . All tracking was done at The Love Story in Brooklyn , NY . The album was mixed with Don Zientara at Inner Ear Studio and mastered by Chad Clark at Silver Sonya .  - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at  rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl.  - Dischord Records is a Washington, D.C.-based independent record label specializing in the independent punk rock music of the D.C.-area music scene. The label is co-owned by Ian MacKaye and Jeff Nelson, who founded Dischord in 1980 to release \\"Minor Disturbance\\" by The Teen Idles. Along with other independent American labels such as Twin/Tone, Touch and Go Records, and SST Records, Dischord helped to spearhead the nationwide network of underground bands that formed the pre-Nirvana indie-rock scene. These labels presided over the shift from the hardcore punk that then dominated the American underground scene to the more diverse styles of alternative rock that were emerging.  - The LP (from \\"long playing\\" or \\"long play\\") is an analog sound storage medium, a vinyl record format characterized by a speed of rpm, a 12 or 10 inch (30 or 25 cm) diameter, and use of the \\"microgroove\\" groove specification. Introduced by Columbia in 1948, it was soon adopted as a new standard by the entire record industry. Apart from a few relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of stereophonic sound, it has remained the standard format for vinyl albums.  - MPEG-1 and/or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III, more commonly referred to as MP3, is an audio coding format for digital audio which uses a form of lossy data compression. It is a common audio format for consumer audio streaming or storage, as well as a de facto standard of digital audio compression for the transfer and playback of music on most digital audio players and computing devices.  - A book is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of paper, parchment, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side, with text and/or images printed in ink. A single sheet within a book is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page. A set of text-filled or illustrated pages produced in electronic format is known as an electronic book, or e-book.   - Compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format released in 1982 and co-developed by Philips and Sony. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. Audio CD players have been commercially available since October 1982, when the first commercially available CD player was released in Japan.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: In recent weeks, the investigation into possible collusion between President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia has intensified, raising the prospect that the probe could become an issue in advance of the November midterm congressional elections. Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort made another appearance in federal court in Washington Wednesday, where he pleaded not guilty to the latest round of charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller.  Last week, Rick Gates, Manafort’s former deputy, pleaded guilty to lying to prosecutors and is now cooperating with the investigation. In mid-February, 13 Russians were indicted in connection with election meddling, which deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein described as an effort to “promote discord in the United States and undermine public confidence in democracy. We must not allow them to succeed.” Congressional inquiries also continue. Hope Hicks, the White House communications director and a longtime Trump aide, was the latest figure to testify before a congressional committee on the Russia probe. Hicks declined to answer some questions before a closed session of the House Intelligence Committee, frustrating several Democrats. “This is not executive privilege. This is executive stonewalling,” said ranking committee Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff.  But there was more pushback from the White House this week. President Trump fired off a series of tweets dismissing the probe as a “WITCH HUNT.” “They have had this phony cloud over this administration, over our government,” Trump told reporters at the White House last month. “And it has hurt our government, it does hurt our government. It is a Democrat hoax.” Democrats reject that view, including Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. “I continue to believe that this is the most important thing that I will work on in my whole public career, and getting the whole truth out is extraordinarily important,” he said.  Warner’s committee is also investigating possible... What did Trump think of Sen. Mark Warner the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee?  A.

The jealousy of other people’s better houses, Make this lower case.","output":"The jealousy of other people's better houses, Lower case version:  \\"the jealousy of other people's better houses,\\" To provide a detailed explanation, capitalization is one of the fundamental aspects of writing in English. Rules for using capitalization in English can be simple but a bit tricky to remember and apply.  In English, we can classify sentences or phrases into two types according to their capitalization: 1. Upper case: All words in the sentence/ phrase starts with a capital letter. This is often used in headlines, titles, or headers. For example, \\"The Jealousy of Other People’s Better Houses.\\" 2. Lower case: Only the first letter of the first word (and any proper nouns or names) start with a capital letter. Everything else that follows in the sentence or phrase starts with small letters unless they are proper nouns, pronouns, etc. For example, \\"the jealousy of other people's better houses,\\" The request in question asked me to convert \\"The jealousy of other people’s better houses,\\" into lower case. When we do so, we start the sentence with a small letter, and all other letters remain small unless they are the start of a proper noun or pronoun. Therefore, \\"The jealousy of other people’s better houses,\\" became \\"the jealousy of other people's better houses,\\" after converting it to lower case.  This is important because different styles of capitalization have different effects upon the reader. Proper capitalization following standard rules can help writing appear more formal and professional, whereas unconventional uses of capitalization can change the tone or emphasis in a piece of text.  Even small pieces of manipulation, like simply putting a sentence into lower case letters, can affect interpretation of the text. It can make a line seem less important or quieter and tends to draw less attention, meaning it appears less assertive or less of a proclamation.  So, such a change carries that added sense of indirectness or subordination, can render the phrase less obtrusive and, by common extension, less forceful. Therefore, understanding the usage and rules of capitalization is important for one's overall proficiency in written English."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: This article: Scarpia's apartment in the Palazzo Farnese, that evening Scarpia, at supper, sends a note to Tosca asking her to come to his apartment, anticipating that two of his goals will soon be fulfilled at once. His agent, Spoletta, arrives to report that Angelotti remains at large, but Cavaradossi has been arrested for questioning.  He is brought in, and an interrogation ensues. As the painter steadfastly denies knowing anything about Angelotti's escape, Tosca's voice is heard singing a celebratory cantata elsewhere in the Palace. She enters the apartment in time to see Cavaradossi being escorted to an antechamber. All he has time to say is that she mustn't tell them anything.  Scarpia then claims she can save her lover from indescribable pain if she reveals Angelotti's hiding place. She resists, but the sound of screams coming through the door eventually breaks her down, and she tells Scarpia to search the well in the garden of Cavaradossi's villa. Scarpia orders his torturers to cease, and the bloodied painter is dragged back in. He's devastated to discover that Tosca has betrayed his friend. Sciarrone, another agent, then enters with news: there was an upset on the battlefield at Marengo, and the French are marching on Rome. Cavaradossi, unable to contain himself, gloats to Scarpia that his rule of terror will soon be at an end. This is enough for the police to consider him guilty, and they haul him away to be shot. Scarpia, now alone with Tosca, proposes a bargain: if she gives herself to him, Cavaradossi will be freed. She is revolted, and repeatedly rejects his advances, but she hears the drums outside announcing an execution. As Scarpia awaits her decision, she prays, asking why God has abandoned her in her hour of need: \\"Vissi d'arte\\" (\\"I lived for art\\"). She tries to offer money, but Scarpia isn't interested in that kind of bribe: he wants Tosca herself. Spoletta returns with the news that Angelotti has killed himself upon discovery, and that everything is in place for Cavaradossi's execution.
