Q:I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot. Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: Tombstone Movie plot: Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell), a retired peace officer with a notable reputation, reunites with his brothers Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton) in Tucson, Arizona, where they venture on towards Tombstone, a small mining town, to settle down. There they encounter Wyatt's long-time friend Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer), a Southern gambler and expert gunslinger, who seeks relief from his worsening tuberculosis. Josephine Marcus (Dana Delany) and Mr. Fabian (Billy Zane) are also newly arrived in Tombstone with a traveling theater troupe. Meanwhile, Wyatt's common-law wife, Mattie Blaylock (Dana Wheeler-Nicholson), is becoming dependent on a potent narcotic. Wyatt and his brothers begin to profit from a stake in a gambling emporium and saloon when they have their first encounter with a band of outlaws called the Cowboys, led by \\"Curly Bill\\" Brocious (Powers Boothe). The Cowboys are identifiable by the red sashes worn around their waist. Wyatt, though no longer a lawman, is pressured to help rid the town of the Cowboys as tensions rise. Curly Bill begins shooting aimlessly after a visit to an opium house and is approached by Marshal Fred White (Harry Carey, Jr.) to relinquish his firearms. Curly Bill instead shoots the marshal dead and is forcibly taken into custody by Wyatt. The arrest infuriates Ike Clanton (Stephen Lang) and the other Cowboys. Curly Bill stands trial, but is found not guilty due to a lack of witnesses. Virgil, unable to tolerate lawlessness, becomes the new marshal and imposes a weapons ban within the city limits. This leads to the legendary Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, in which Billy Clanton (Thomas Haden Church) and other Cowboys are killed. Virgil and Morgan are wounded, and the allegiance of county sheriff Johnny Behan (Jon Tenney) with the Cowboys is made clear. As retribution for the Cowboy deaths, Wyatt's brothers are ambushed; Morgan is killed, while Virgil is left handicapped. A despondent Wyatt and his family leave Tombstone and board a train, with Clanton and Frank Stilwell close... My question: What is Tombstone?

Information:  - The Constitution for the Kingdom of the Netherlands is one of two fundamental documents governing the Kingdom of the Netherlands as well as the fundamental law of the European territory of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The present constitution is generally seen as directly derived from the one issued in 1815, constituting a constitutional monarchy. A revision in 1848 instituted a system of parliamentary democracy. In 1983, a major revision of the constitution was undertaken, almost fully rewriting the text and adding new civil rights. The text is very sober, devoid of legal or political doctrine. It includes a bill of rights. The constitution prohibits the judiciary to test laws and treaties against the constitution, as this is considered a prerogative of the legislature. There is no constitutional court in the Netherlands, except for the Constitutional Court of Sint Maarten which only governs the Sint Maarten legislator. The Kingdom of the Netherlands also includes Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten: there is an overarching instrument of the entire kingdom that has constitution characterisics: the Statute of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.  - The Amsterdam metropolitan area is the city region around the city of Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands.

Article: A black hole is a place in space where gravity pulls so much that even light cannot get out. The gravity is so strong because matter has been squeezed into a tiny space. This can happen when a star is dying. Because no light can get out, people can't see black holes. Space telescopes with special tools can help find black holes. The special tools can see how stars that are very close to black holes act differently from other ones. Black holes can be big or small. Scientists think the smallest black holes are as small as just one atom. These black holes are very tiny but have the mass of a large mountain. Mass is the amount of matter, or \\"staff\\", in an object. Another kind of black hole is called \\"stellar\\" . Its mass can be up to 20 times more than the mass of the sun. There may be many stellar mass black holes in Earth's galaxy. Earth's galaxy is called the Milky Way. The largest black holes are called \\"supermassive\\" . These black holes have masses that are more than one million suns together. Scientists have found proof that every large _ contains a supermassive black hole at its center. The supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy has a mass equal to about four million suns and would fit inside a very large ball that could hold a few million Earths. Scientists think the smallest black holes formed when the universe began. Stellar black holes are made when the center of a very big star falls in upon itself, or falls apart. When this happens, it exploded part of the star into space. Scientists think supermassive black holes were made at the same time as the galaxy they are in. A black hole can not be seen because strong gravity pulls all of the light into the middle of the black hole. But scientists can see how the strong gravity affects the stars and gas around the black hole. Scientists can study stars to find out if they are flying around, or orbiting a black hole. When a black hole and a star are close together, high-energy light is made. This kind of light cannot be seen with human...

Article: On a Saturday morning earlier this September, the world got its first look at the Strati. This electric vehicle is unlike any other currently on the road. It rolls on four wheels, but its body and chassis  weren't built in a factory. Instead, Strati's designers used a technology called 3-D printing. It created those parts of the car in one piece, from the ground up. \\"Compared to a typical vehicle on the road, the Strati definitely looks different,\\" says Greg Schroeder, a senior research engineer at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. He did not work on the new car. His organization studies trends and changes in the auto industry. It took 44 hours to print the new car at the International Manufacturing Technology Show in Chicago. Over the next few days, the car's designers installed additional parts. These included the car's engine, brakes and tires. Then, early on September 13, Jay Rogers climbed into the car, started its engine and drove the vehicle onto the street. Rogers helped found Local Motors. It's the Arizona-based company behind the Strati. Two weeks later, his team printed a second Strati, and just as fast, at a fair in New York City. Justin Fishkin, a local Motors official, sees the Strati as a window into the future. Today, car buyers are limited in their choice of a vehicle. They can order only what car companies have already designed. But in the future, he says, you may be able to design your own car online and then get it printed to order. Manufacturing experts say 3-D printing has begun to revolutionize how they make things. The technology has been around for decades. But these machines used to be so expensive that only large companies could afford them. In the last few years, though, that has changed. Many of the machines are now inexpensive enough for small companies--or even individuals --to own. Some local libraries make them available to the public. High Schools are beginning to use them in classrooms. Wide access to these printers means people can now design and print...

Title: Bicycle Thieves Movie plot: The film tells the story of Antonio Ricci, an unemployed man in the depressed post-World War II economy of Italy. With no money and a wife and two children to support, he is desperate for work. He is delighted to at last get a good job hanging up posters, but on the sole condition that he has a bicycle which must be used for work. He is told unequivocally: \\"No bicycle, no job.\\" His wife Maria pawns their bedsheets in order to get money to redeem his bicycle from the pawnbroker.Early on in the film, Ricci's coveted bicycle is stolen by a bold young thief who snatches it when he is hanging up a poster.Antonio thinks that the police will take the theft very seriously, but they are not really interested in the petty theft of a bike. The only option is for Antonio and his friends to walk the streets of Rome themselves, looking for the bicycle. After trying for hours with no luck, they finally give up and leave.Desperate for leads and with his better judgement clouded, Antonio even visits the dubious backstreet fortune teller that he had earlier mocked, in the hope that she may be able to shed light upon the bike's whereabouts. However, she merely doles out to him one of the truisms that form her stock in trade: \\"you'll find the bike quickly, or not at all.\\" Feeling cheated, a crestfallen Antonio hands over to her some of the last money that they have. After a rare treat of a meal in a restaurant, Antonio admits to his son that if he isn't able to work, they will simply starve.Antonio finally manages to locate the thief (who, it seems, had already sold the bicycle) and Bruno slips off to summon the police to the apartment.

While the paragraph gives a brief overview of his career, touching upon the teams he played for in the National Football League (NFL) and his college football years at the University of Pittsburgh, it does not provide any information related to his salary or earnings. To determine whether Stanley Anthony Woods was one of the highest paid football players, we would need additional information about his contracts and earnings during his time with the Seattle Seahawks, Los Angeles Rams, and Washington Redskins. Comparing his salary and earnings to those of other players in the league at that time would also be crucial.  It is important to keep in mind that average NFL player salaries have significantly increased over the past few decades. With this in mind, even if Woods was among the highest paid players during his tenure, there's a chance that his earnings might be comparatively lower than those of more recent NFL stars.

Write a summary based on this article: Authorities in Baton Rouge said Tuesday that they have arrested a white man in the fatal shooting of two black men in separate incidents last week. Police have described the shootings as potentially racially motivated.      On Tuesday, while announcing the arrest and charges, officials also said that the suspect may be linked to a third shooting last week, as well — this one targeting a home with black residents. Two people were inside, but they were unharmed, Hillar C. Moore III, the district attorney in East Baton Rouge, said at a news conference.      Moore said the man in custody — Kenneth James Gleason — is thought to have fired at the two men killed last week while inside his car before getting out, standing over them and firing additional shots.      “It appears to be cold, calculated, planned,” Moore said, adding that the attacks targeted “people who were unarmed and defenseless.”      [Two apparently random shootings in Baton Rouge could be racially motivated, police say]      The Baton Rouge police chief said Tuesday that Gleason’s arrest in the “brutal murders” last week probably saved lives because the 23-year-old “would’ve probably killed again.”      Gleason — who had been arrested, released and rearrested during the investigation — could face the death penalty, Moore said.      Although officials have not definitively announced a motive, citing the ongoing investigation, they said earlier that the two killings could have been racially motivated. Gleason has spoken to authorities, Moore said, but the prosecutor declined to elaborate on what was said.      The first known fatal shooting occurred Tuesday, Sept. 12, when Bruce Cofield was killed, according to authorities. Cofield, a homeless man known to people in the community, was fatally shot late that night. Two days later, police say, Donald Smart was found with fatal gunshot wounds. Smart was a popular employee at Louie’s Cafe, a diner near the Louisiana State University campus.      A third shooting predated Cofield and Smart’s deaths, Moore said when outlining a timeline in the case at the news conference. On Monday, Sept. 11, Moore said, Gleason fired three shots from a 9mm gun at an occupied home not far from his own.      Kenneth Gleason, 23, escorted to jail in Philmont shirt, a Boy Scout camp. He's been connected to 2 killings, possibly racially motivated pic.twitter.com/uNa3tuRPDl — Grace Toohey (@grace_2e) September 19, 2017      Gleason was booked Tuesday in the East Baton Rouge Parish Prison on counts of first-degree murder, illegal use of a weapon and aggravated criminal damage to property.      “He strongly denies the allegations, and he will be vindicated,” Chris Alexander, Gleason’s attorney, wrote in an email Tuesday.      The shootings come as racial tension has flared up across the country recently, erupting in violence in places such as New York, where a white man fatally stabbed a black man he encountered on the street; Portland, Ore., where two men were fatally stabbed while trying to intervene when a train passenger began shouting anti-Muslim hate speech; and Kansas, where a man was indicted on hate-crime charges in the fatal shooting of one Indian man and wounding of another.      Baton Rouge has also seen its share of violence and unrest, with an increasing number of homicides this year. Last year, the city was also the site of heated protests after police fatally shot Alton Sterling, a black man, outside a grocery store; two weeks later, three officers were gunned down in an ambush attack.      “Baton Rouge has been through a lot of turmoil in the last year,” Jonathan Dunnam, the interim police chief, said at the briefing. “Had there not been a swift conclusion to this case, I feel confident this killer would’ve probably killed again. He could’ve potentially created a tear in the fabric that holds this community together.”      Mayor-President Sharon Weston Broome (D) commended law enforcement officers for their work in the case.      “While the motive is still unclear, this person is off of our streets,” she said at the briefing.      [Fatal stabbing in New York was ‘practice’ for more attacks on black men, police say]      Officials cited a combination of evidence, help from members of the public, police work and technology in disclosing how they came to identify, arrest and charge Gleason. Moore said they were able to link Gleason to the shootings early Tuesday when DNA found on the shell casings matched his own.      Moore said Gleason bought a 9mm gun in Baton Rouge on Nov. 9. In July, Gleason bought a silencer that “thankfully” had not come yet, Moore said. The following month, Gleason completed a class to obtain a concealed-carry permit, although he did not get the permit yet either, Moore said.      Tuesday marked the third time in recent days that Gleason was booked into the prison, according to the sheriff’s office. He was booked on Saturday for purported drug possession and released on a 3,500 bond, prison records show. Moore said Gleason was arrested again Monday for allegedly stealing a copy of “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy,” the Douglas Adams sci-fi book.      That reported book theft factored into the timeline Moore offered Tuesday. The days when the shots were fired at the residence and Cofield was killed, police received reports about a white man with a red car spotted carrying a gun, Moore said. In one case, the man was seen putting the gun in bushes, but no gun was found, Moore said; in the other, the man was seen appearing to take off his license plate and putting a gun in the trunk.      On Tuesday, Sept. 12, the day Cofield was killed, “witnesses describe [seeing] a red car and a white male wearing tactical gear,” Moore said.      [Southern Poverty Law Center says American hate groups are on the rise]      The “Hitchhiker’s Guide” theft was reported the following day at a Books-a-Million in a mall in Baton Rouge. The report, given to police, described the potential suspect: a white man in a red car.      The next day, Smart was killed with 10 rounds fired from a 9mm gun, Moore said. Video was captured, but it was not helpful, Moore said. Two witnesses describe seeing something: a white man and a red car.      “Things are now starting to come together,” Moore said.      By Friday, shell casings picked up at the shooting scenes appeared to be the same caliber: 9mm. Moore said more common factors were seen potentially linking the fatal shootings.      “We have two African Americans that are killed, seem to be killed in the same matter, that is a red car that’s driving by, [someone] shoots from the car, then eventually after that person is taken down to the ground, then gets out of the car and apparently over the victim, if the victim is injured or dead, and continues to fire,” Moore said.      Investigators began searching for the red car, looking at footage appearing to show the vehicle as well as a white man taking a license plate off it. Moore said an officer working extra duty found the car on Saturday.      Search warrants were issued that day, while Gleason was booked on the drug charges and interviewed. He was released Sunday on bond and then rearrested Monday in the book theft, Moore said.      Early Tuesday, the DNA was found to be a match, Moore said, and Gleason was arrested again.

Gleason is charged with two counts of first degree murder and other charges, for three... (Associated Press)      BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — A 23-year-old white man arrested Tuesday was accused of killing two black men and firing on a black family in a string of attacks that police say may have been racially motivated.      A law enforcement official said they had found a copy of an Adolf Hitler speech at the home of Kenneth James Gleason, and investigators said DNA on shell casings and other evidence link him to the crimes.      Gleason was led away from the police department in handcuffs just before authorities there held a news conference to announce that he would be charged with first-degree murder in the shooting deaths last week of a homeless man and a dishwasher who was walking to work.      \\"I feel confident that this killer would have killed again,\\" interim Police Chief Jonny Dunnam said.      Gleason's attorney, J. Christopher Alexander, said his client \\"vehemently denies guilt, and we look forward to complete vindication.\\" Alexander declined to say anything else.      Authorities found a copy of the Hitler speech during a search of Gleason's home over the weekend, according to the law enforcement official who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing.      Asked whether police suspect race was a motive for the shootings, Sgt. L'Jean McKneely said: \\"We're not completely closed off to that. We're looking at all possibilities at this time, so we're not going to just pinpoint that.\\"      District Attorney Hillar Moore said his office could seek the death penalty.      \\"It appears to be cold, calculated, planned (against) people who were unarmed and defenseless,\\" he said. \\"We don't need to prove motive. There are a lot of things that are unanswered.\\"      No one was injured when Gleason fired multiple times into the home of a black family in his neighborhood on Sept. 11, authorities said. It's not clear if Gleason knew the family.      In the other shootings, Gleason fired from his car then walked up to the victims as they were lying on the ground and fired again multiple times, police said. Neither victim had any prior relationship with Gleason.      The first fatal shooting occurred Sept. 12 when 59-year-old Bruce Cofield, who was homeless, was shot to death. The second happened last Thursday night when 49-year-old Donald Smart was gunned down while walking to his job as a dishwasher at a cafe popular with Louisiana State University students.      The attacks came at a time when Louisiana's capital already was in the grips of a surge in violence. The number of homicides in East Baton Rouge Parish has already surpassed last year's total of 62, The Advocate newspaper reported earlier this month.      \\"Baton Rouge has been through a lot of turmoil in the last year. Has there not been a swift conclusion to this case, I feel confident that this killer probably would have killed again,\\" the police chief said. \\"He could have potentially created a tear in the fabric that holds this community together.\\"      Racial tensions roiled the city in the summer of 2016 when a black man was shot to death by white police officers outside of a convenience store. About two weeks later, a black gunman targeted police in an ambush, killing three officers and wounding three others before he was shot to death.      The city of about 229,000 is about 55 percent black and 40 percent white.      Gleason didn't appear to have any active social media profiles. A spokesman at Louisiana State University said a student by that name attended the university from the fall of 2013 to the fall of 2014 before withdrawing. He had transferred to LSU from Baton Rouge Community College.      During the search of Gleason's home, authorities also found 9 grams of marijuana and vials of human growth hormone, according to a police document. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

The stream then thought, \\"I've been through countless obstacles. I should have no problem crossing this desert!\\" But when she decided to start her journey, she found herself gradually disappearing into the mud and sand. After numerous tries, she found it was all in vain and was very upset. \\"Maybe it's my destiny  ! I'm not destined to reach the vast ocean in the legend, \\" she murmured sadly to herself. At this time, a deep voice came, saying, \\"If a breeze can cross the desert, so can a river.\\" It was the voice of the desert. Unconvinced, the little stream replied, \\"That's because a breeze can fly, but I can't.\\" \\"That's because you stick to what you are. If you're willing to give it up, and let yourself evaporate   into the breeze, it can take you across, and you can reach your destination,\\" said the desert in its deep voice. The little stream had never heard of such a thing. \\"Give up what I am now and disappear into the breeze? No! No!\\" She could not accept this idea. After all, she had never experienced anything like it before. Wouldn't it be self-destruction to give up what she was now? \\"How do I know if this is true?\\" asked the little stream. \\"The breeze can carry the vapor across the desert and release it as rain at an appropriate site. The rain will form a river again to continue its course,\\" answered the desert very patiently. \\"Will I still be what I am now?\\" asked the little stream. \\"Yes, and no. Whether you're a river or invisible vapor, your inner nature never changes. You stick to the fact that you're a river because you don't know your inner nature,\\" answered the desert.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person who didn't finish the normal high magnification search before Waddle took the periscope?  As Greeneville ascended to periscope depth, Waddle checked the sonar displays and the fire control station monitors, but reported later that he heard and saw nothing to suggest that the previously detected vessels in the area were now any closer to the submarine's position than had been reported before the submarine began the high speed maneuvers. Because the AVSDU was not working, Greeneville's executive officer, Lieutenant Commander Gerald K. Pfeifer, entered the sonar room and observed the contacts on the sonar screens.  Pfeifer then stood in the doorway between the sonar and control rooms, but did not communicate any updated sonar information to Waddle in the control room.  At 13:34, sonar gained a new contact, designated S-14.  Because Greeneville had not maintained a steady, slow course for a sufficient amount of time, the sonar data available to the Fire Control Technician of the Watch did not allow  accurate determination on Ehime Maru's range or course.  Also, due to time constraints placed by Waddle, the ship did not perform normal maneuvers which would be used to obtain accurate course and range information on the sonar contacts prior to proceeding to periscope depth.At 13:38, Greeneville reached periscope depth (about 60 feet (18 m) below the surface).  At this time, Ehime Maru was about 2,315 yards (2.117 km) or 1.14 nautical miles (2.1 km) away from the submarine and heading in her direction.  Although sonar data began to more accurately depict Ehime Maru's true range and bearing at this point, this was not evident to the sonar operators.  Lieutenant, Junior Grade Michael J. Coen, the officer of the deck, conducted an initial low  magnification periscope search of the area and sighted no nearby ships.   Waddle then took the periscope before Coen could complete the normal high magnification search.  Since waves were washing over the periscope, Waddle ordered the submarine to go up another few feet to increase the distance the periscope can view.

In the 1980s, a young guitarist called Euronymous forms a black metal band called Mayhem, the first of the genre in their country of Norway, with Necrobutcher on bass, and  Manheim on drums. Manhein leaves and is soon replaced by new drummer Hellhammer and they recruit a new vocalist from Sweden called Dead, who exhibits self-destructive behavior, which he portrays during their live shows by cutting himself and bleeding on the audience, and throwing pig heads at the \\"posers\\". At a show filmed by their friend Metalion, the band meets a fan named Kristian, whom Euronymous initially looks down on. While home alone, Dead uses his personal knife to cut his arms and throat, and then uses Euronymous' shotgun to shoot himself in the forehead, leaving behind a suicide note. Euronymous returns home and finds the body but instead of calling the police, he takes photos of the body and moves the knife and shotgun around. After Dead's body is taken away, Euronymous gives necklaces to the other band members which he claims are pieces of Dead's skull; this disgusts Necrobutcher, prompting him to leave the band. Soon after, Euronymous starts his own black metal record label and opens a record shop called Helvete, which becomes a social hub for black-metallers like Metalion, Fenriz of Darkthrone, Faust of Emperor, and Kristian (who is now calling himself Varg Vikernes) of Burzum. They become known as the \\"Black Circle\\". After being mocked by an ego-driven Euronymous, Varg uses his anti-Christian beliefs as motivation to burn down a local church. When approached by Varg concerning his status as the leader of the Black Circle, Euronymous burns down a church with Faust and Varg accompanying. Euronymous recruits Varg as bassist, a guitarist called Blackthorn and a Hungarian vocalist, Attila Csihar, to record Mayhem's first album, De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas. A power dispute between Varg and Euronymous arises.

Context: David Gauntlett makes a good point in his newest book (Making Media Studies: The Creativity Turn in Media and Communications Studies) and that is that traditional forms of media studies are no longer applicable. Gone are the days of massive institutions and production companies, gone are the traditional audiences and simplistic texts. In, is the new age media companies, the everyday media makers, the consistent consumers and the fantastical mess of The WWW. While universities are pumping out the same content areas since the 1980’s (e.g. institutions, production, audiences and texts) that are only relevant to a handful of media forms (cinema, television, online broadcasting and publications), the rest of the world is moving on. David Gauntlett so rightly says that creativity in media, should also refer to thinking creatively about the subject. What are the new ways of running media and communication studies? How has the subject itself changed? What approaches and methods can help media and communications studies to become innovative and useful in spheres beyond itself? David Gauntlett encourages a kind of call to arms, an acquiescence of the incapacities of the old system and a redirected gaze to the future needs of media students and media studies programs. Inspired by Tim Ingold’s book Making, David believes media studies should have making at it’s front and centre. He also believes the ability to do things with media should be embraced over and above the ability to talk about what others do with media, or what media does to us. The notion is that media studies should be hands on, that it should be all about ideas and critical engagement and this should be expressed through actual making. To borrow three key distinctions from the anthropologist Tim Ingold: 1. It’s about learning WITH media rather than ABOUT media. 2. There is an intent to move FORWARD rather than looking BACKWARDS at how things are. 3. It’s aims are TRANSFORMATIONAL rather than DOCUMENTARY.

Her 17-year-old brother Mark is a nerdy high school student who plays clarinet in a garage band and shuns girls in order to prepare for college. Dawn's younger sister, 8-year-old Missy, is a spoiled, manipulative little girl who pesters Dawn and dances around the house in a tutu. Their mother is a shrewd woman who always dotes on Missy and sides with her in disputes with Dawn. Their father is a meek, immature, selfish man who sides with Dawn's mother in arguments with Dawn. Mark is the only one in the family who is even remotely friendly or respectful to Dawn and even that isn't saying a whole lot. Dawn's only friend is an effeminate fifth-grade boy named Ralphy, with whom she shares a dilapidated clubhouse in her backyard. At school, Dawn is verbally bullied by literally every student she comes into contact with. She is teased and ridiculed and her locker is covered in graffiti. After her teacher unfairly keeps her after school, she is threatened with rape by a bully named Brandon McCarthy, who also has trouble socializing. At home, Dawn's mother punishes her for calling Missy a lesbian and refusing to be nice to her (the same verbal way that other students at the school call Dawn). Dawn is suspended for three days after she accidentally hits a teacher in the eye with a spitball. She refuses to tell her parents or the school principal about the bullying, aware that it will only lead to worse bullying for herself. Brandon's first attempt to rape Dawn after school fails, but he orders her to meet him again. After she complies, he takes her to an abandoned field. Instead of forcing himself upon her, Brandon starts an earnest conversation with her and kisses her. Meanwhile, Mark's band is joined by Steve Rodgers, a charismatic and handsome aspiring teenage rock musician who agrees to play in the band in exchange for Mark's help in school.

Apple discontinued the use of PowerPC microprocessors in 2006. At WWDC 2005, Steve Jobs announced this transition, revealing that Mac OS X was always developed to run on both the Intel and PowerPC architectures. All new Macs now use x86 processors made by Intel, and some were renamed as a result. Intel-based Macs running OS X 10.6 and below (support has been discontinued since 10.7) can run pre-existing software developed for PowerPC using an emulator called Rosetta, although at noticeably slower speeds than native programs. However, the Classic environment is unavailable on the Intel architecture. Intel chips introduced the potential to run the Microsoft Windows operating system natively on Apple hardware, without emulation software such as Virtual PC. In March 2006, a group of hackers announced that they were able to run Windows XP on an Intel-based Mac. The group released their software as open source and has posted it for download on their website. On April 5, 2006, Apple announced the availability of the public beta of Boot Camp, software that allows owners of Intel-based Macs to install Windows XP on their machines; later versions added support for Windows Vista and Windows 7. Classic was discontinued in Mac OS X 10.5, and Boot Camp became a standard feature on Intel-based Macs.

This transition opened up new possibilities such as the ability to run the Microsoft Windows operating system natively on Apple hardware, without the need for emulation software. Consequently, this led to advancements such as the release of Boot Camp, which permitted owners of Intel-based Macs to install Windows XP, and later, Windows Vista and Windows 7 on their machines.

Write an article based on this \\"People with lower back problems are more likely to have a spine similar in shape to the chimpanzee, our closest ape relatives.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Spine Shape Similarities between Humans with Lower Back Problems and Chimpanzees: A Crucial Discovery  Introduction Lower back pain has become a common health issue affecting millions of people around the world. With an increasing number of individuals complaining of back problems, researchers have been trying to find the root causes behind these issues. A surprising link has recently been discovered between people with lower back problems and the spine shape of our closest ape relatives, the chimpanzees. This article will delve into this connection and discuss the implications of this finding. Background Our understanding of the human spine has evolved over the years, but it is well known that our spinal column is designed to carry the weight of our upper body and protect the delicate spinal cord. Humans, unlike other primates, have an S-shaped spine that helps distribute the weight of our upright posture. Recent studies have demonstrated that people with lower back problems are more likely to possess a spine shape similar to the chimpanzee, our closest ape relatives. By analyzing the spine shape and comparing it to chimpanzees, researchers have been able to establish a connection between lower back pain and this distinct spinal curvature.  The Study The study involved observing and analyzing the spines of individuals with and without lower back problems. Using advanced imaging techniques and statistical analysis, researchers compared the spinal shape of these humans to the spinal structure of chimpanzees. The results indicated that individuals with lower back pain exhibited spine shapes that more closely resemble those of chimpanzees than those without pain. Possible Implications This discovery has multiple implications in the world of healthcare and medical research. Firstly, it provides a new perspective on the possible causes of lower back pain. Researchers can now focus on studying and understanding the underlying factors that may lead to the difference in spine shape and how it contributes to pain. The study also raises the question of whether spinal shape is a natural or acquired trait in some individuals. Moreover, this finding can pave the way for new treatment options. By determining the specific spinal characteristics that cause or contribute to pain, healthcare professionals may be able to develop targeted therapies or preventative measures to address these issues.  For instance, physical therapy exercises or chiropractic adjustments may be tailored to correct spine curvature and alleviate lower back pain. Additionally, advancements in orthopedic technologies could lead to the development of spinal supports or devices that promote better spinal alignment for people with atypical spinal shapes. Conclusion In conclusion, the discovery of a connection between people with lower back problems and the chimpanzee-like spine shape has significant potential for improving our understanding of lower back pain. This insight can guide researchers and medical practitioners in developing targeted treatments and preventive measures to address these problems and ultimately improve the lives of individuals suffering from chronic lower back pain."},{"instruction":"Q:I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Movie title: Dragonfly Movie plot: Joe and Emily Darrow are doctors in a Chicago hospital. Seven months pregnant Emily travels to Venezuela to help natives in the Amazon area. She dies when a bus is hit by a landslide and plunges into the river below. Her body is never found by the local authorities. Without taking time to grieve Joe returns to work. One night he is awakened by his wife's dragonfly paper weight that falls and rolls across the room. His wife always had a passion for dragonflies and even had a birthmark on her shoulder which resembled a dragonfly. Joe starts visiting EmilyÂ´s patients at the pediatric oncology in the hospital. One of his wife's patients is brought in unconscious. Joe hears the child calling his name and follows the staff who are trying to revive him without success - the childÂ´s heart flatlines. As Joe approaches the child, suddenly the heart begins beating again. The following afternoon Joe returns to the child who asks him if he is \\"Emily's Joe\\" and tells him she sent him back to tell Joe something. All over the room are drawings of a curvy cross, but the boy doesn't know what the symbol means. The boy tells about his near death experience, that he saw a light, and a woman showing him an image of Joe, and that the cross symbol was what he saw at the end of the rainbow. Later, while passing by another child's room, Joe sees the same drawing. That boy immediately knows who Joe is and tells him that he must \\"go to the rainbow\\". When Joe arrives at home, his parrot mysteriously goes into a rage breaking a pot making the same wavy cross symbol drawn in the spilled soil on the floor. Joe spots a dragonfly flying outside the window, and briefly sees Emily reaching for him outside that same window. Joe's neighbour, Miriam Belmont, tries to talk him back into reality.

Elephants Dream was supposed to be the flagship project of the open source community. And while it was a very interesting idea in concept, in reality it has failed miserably. The film is beautifully rendered, which is probably the only redeeming factor. A huge problem with them, however, is the vast overruse of light bloom. It's horrible, although I guess it helps give the film a dreamlike quality. One thing to note is the terrible voice acting. While Proog's voice actor is at least semi-competent, Emo's voice actor is HORRIBLE. I guess when you have a budget that basically amounts to zero, you can't afford to hire real voice actors. To me it seems like they hired one of the animators to do his voice. As a whole, the movie doesn't really go anywhere.

The answer to the question: How many miles does the does the coastal nation have sole exploitation rights over natural resources? is inside the article: \\"Freedom of the seas\\" is a principle in international law dating from the seventeenth century. It stresses freedom to navigate the oceans and disapproves of war fought in international waters. Today, this concept is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the third version of which came into force in 1994. Article 87(1) states: \\"The high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked.\\" Article 87(1) (a) to (f) gives a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of submarine cables, building artificial islands, fishing and scientific research. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.UNCLOS defines various areas of water. \\"Internal waters\\" are on the landward side of a baseline and foreign vessels have no right of passage in these. \\"Territorial waters\\" extend to 12 nautical miles (22 kilometres; 14 miles) from the coastline and in these waters, the coastal state is free to set laws, regulate use and exploit any resource. A \\"contiguous zone\\" extending a further 12 nautical miles allows for hot pursuit of vessels suspected of infringing laws in four specific areas: customs, taxation, immigration and pollution. An \\"exclusive economic zone\\" extends for 200 nautical miles (370 kilometres; 230 miles) from the baseline. Within this area, the coastal nation has sole exploitation rights over all natural resources. The \\"continental shelf\\" is the natural prolongation of the land territory to the continental margin's outer edge, or 200 nautical miles from the coastal state's baseline, whichever is greater. Here the coastal nation has the exclusive right to harvest minerals and also living resources \\"attached\\" to the seabed., can you guess it ? Answer:","output":"The coastal nation has sole exploitation rights over natural resources within an area defined as the \\"exclusive economic zone\\" (EEZ) by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The EEZ extends for 200 nautical miles (370 kilometers; 230 miles) from the baseline, which is usually the low-water line or the seaward limit of the nation's territorial waters. Within this zone, the coastal nation has exclusive rights to explore, exploit, conserve, and manage natural resources, both living and non-living, in the water column and on and under the seabed. In addition to the exclusive economic zone, the coastal nation also has rights over the \\"continental shelf,\\" which is the natural prolongation of the land territory to the continental margin's outer edge or 200 nautical miles from the coastal state's baseline, whichever is greater. In this area, the coastal nation has the exclusive right to harvest minerals and also living resources \\"attached\\" to the seabed. It is important to note that these rights come with certain obligations for the coastal nation. They are required to use the resources in their EEZ and continental shelf in a sustainable manner, ensure conservation and management measures are in place, cooperate with other nations in the management of shared resources, and respect the rights and freedoms of other nations under international law.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: I have recently watched this movie twice, and I can't seem to understand why the h*ll the makers made this pile of crap. I mean, yes, It gives a great impression of Hitler's environment, and I mean the way they reproduced Austria in the late 1890's, WWI and the Inter-war period. What I can't understand is why they pictured Hitler as a 100% pure evil, mad, unreliable, mentally unstable freak. He was after all a very thoughtful, loving and intelligent man who of course had his dark sides, no doubt about that. But why in heaven's name portray him in this way? All of his positive aspects have been cut out of the scenario, leaving nothing but a very propaganda-like portrait of a man who had the biggest influence on modern civilization ever. Yes, he threw Germany into the devastating 2nd World War. Yes, he was racist, and yes he was at times menially unstable especially at the end of the war. All true. But again; why the hell did they plain LIE to the public? To warn us? I absolutely don't think this movie was a warning. The true danger of Hitler and the Nazi's was the fact they were able to rise to power at moments of severe global weakness. The fact this evil was so recognizable yet so embraced by almost every German alive (not to mention Austrians and a LOT of other people) makes it a warning to modern civilization, NOT the fact Hitler was such a 'weirdo'.

Can we draw the following conclusion?

The only information given is that the medal is awarded to those members of the Irish Defence Forces or Chaplaincy Service who have served overseas on a United Nation Mission or United Nations Mandated Mission. Let us dive deeper to explore related criteria and context relevant to the United Nations Peacekeepers Medal and its potential requirements. The United Nations Peacekeepers Medal is a form of recognition for military personnel and other individuals who have contributed to United Nations peacekeeping operations. The United Nations has been engaged in peacekeeping missions since 1948, and these missions involve military, police, and civilian personnel from various countries who work together to prevent conflict and promote peace. The gold medal with a blue-and-white ribbon signifies the UN's colors and honors the personnel's dedication to peace and security. Before determining whether the United Nations imposes a stipulation of four terms for eligibility for the Peacekeepers Medal, we should examine how the term \\"term\\" is defined in the context of military service. A term may refer to the duration of a servicemember's enlistment or engagement in a particular role. In the context of peacekeeping missions, it could refer to the period spent serving on a particular mission. The United Nations typically defines the length of these terms by the mission and the participating personnel's role. In general, mission length varies greatly, from several months to several years, depending on the situation and requirements of each peacekeeping mission. Personnel contributions to these missions may also be based on rotations, wherein a peacekeeper is present for a specific period, leaves, and gets replaced by another individual from the same or another contributing country. Considering this information, it is essential to keep in mind that the number of terms a peacekeeper serves depends on numerous factors and may not directly correlate with eligibility for the Peacekeepers Medal. Now, when it comes to the eligibility criteria for awarding the United Nations Peacekeepers Medal, it is crucial to know that the United Nations leaves the decision-making to the contributing countries. In this case, the Irish government is responsible for determining eligibility criteria for the recipients of An Bonn Chosantóirí Siochána na Náisiún Aontaithe. In conclusion, without additional information on specific eligibility criteria set by the Irish government for the United Nations Peacekeepers Medal, we cannot firmly assert that the United Nations mandates a recipient to serve at least four terms. However, it is important to note that the requirements for such an award would typically be determined by the contributing country, in this case, Ireland, and would probably take into consideration factors related to the servicemember's duration and contributions to the mission."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This area, which stretches millions of kilometers beyond the orbit of Mars, contains objects and phenomena that could dramatically alter our understanding of the universe.  Here, past the orbit of Mars, lies the asteroid belt. The asteroid belt is a torus-shaped region that houses countless rocky bodies. These bodies range in size from small boulders to objects nearly 1000 kilometers in diameter. It's interesting to note that despite the large number of objects in this area, the asteroid belt is actually quite sparse. If you were to stand on an asteroid in this belt, it's unlikely that you would see another one without the aid of a telescope. Beyond the asteroid belt, we enter the outer regions of the solar system. This realm, bordered by the gas giant Jupiter and extending out past the distant dwarf planet Pluto, is composed primarily of gas giants and icy bodies. The four gas giants - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune - dominate this region with their immense size and gravity. These planets are composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, like the Sun, but also contain heavier elements and compounds, including water, methane, and ammonia.  Further out, beyond the gas giants and past Neptune's orbit, lies the Kuiper belt, home to thousands of icy bodies, including Pluto. This area is thought to be the source of many comets that periodically grace our skies.  Even further out, extending to distances nearly 200,000 astronomical units from the Sun, is the Oort cloud. This hypothetical region, proposed by Dutch astronomer Jan Oort, is thought to house billions of icy objects. The furthest regions of our solar system are vast and mysterious, and their exploration will likely yield surprises and new knowledge for centuries to come.

The firm's early editors were Stanley Kauffman and Bernard Shir-Cliff.  - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.  - Del Rey Books is a branch of Ballantine Books, which is owned by Random House and, in turn, by Penguin Random House. It is a separate imprint established in 1977 under the editorship of author Lester del Rey and his wife Judy-Lynn del Rey. It specializes in science fiction and fantasy books, and formerly manga under its (now defunct) Del Rey Manga imprint. It publishes the \\"Star Wars\\" novels under the LucasBooks imprint (licensed from Lucasfilm, a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Studios division of The Walt Disney Company).  - The term \\"manga\\" (kanji: ; hiragana: ; katakana:  or ) in Japan is a word used to refer to both comics and cartooning. \\"Manga\\" as a term used outside Japan refers to comics originally published in Japan.  - Del Rey Manga was the manga-publishing imprint of Del Rey Books, a branch of Ballantine Books, which in turn is part of Random House, the publishing division of Bertelsmann. It was formed as part of a cross-publishing relationship with Japanese publisher Kodansha. Some of the Del Rey titles, such as \\"Tsubasa Chronicle\\" and \\"xxxHolic\\", are published in the United Kingdom by Tanoshimi. Tricia Narwani, the editor of Del Rey, stated that \\"Del Rey finds most of its talent through conventions and existing professional contacts\\".  - Lester del Rey (June 2, 1915  May 10, 1993) was an American science fiction author and editor. He was the author of many books in the juvenile Winston Science Fiction series, and the editor at Del Rey Books, the fantasy and science fiction imprint of Ballantine Books, along with his fourth wife Judy-Lynn del Rey.  - The Silver Wolf is a novel by Alice Borchardt and published by Del Rey Books in 1993 . It is the first in the Silver Wolf Trilogy .  - Anne Rice (born Howard Allen Frances O'Brien; October 4, 1941) is an American author of gothic fiction, Christian literature, and erotica. She is perhaps best known for her popular and influential series of novels, \\"The Vampire Chronicles\\", revolving around the central character of Lestat. Books from \\"The Vampire Chronicles\\" were the subject of two film adaptations, \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" in 1994, and \\"Queen of the Damned\\" in 2002.  - Lucasfilm Ltd. LLC is an American film and television production company based in the Letterman Digital Arts Center in San Francisco, California. The studio is best known for creating and producing the \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Indiana Jones\\" franchises, as well as its leadership in developing special effects, sound and computer animation for film. Lucasfilm was founded by filmmaker George Lucas in 1971 in San Rafael, California; most of the company's operations were moved to San Francisco in 2005. The Walt Disney Company acquired Lucasfilm in 2012 at a valuation of 4.06 billion.  - The Walt Disney Company, commonly known as Disney, is an American diversified multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate headquartered at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California. It is the world's second largest media conglomerate in terms of revenue, after Comcast. Disney was founded on October 16, 1923, by brothers Walt Disney and Roy O. Disney as the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio, and established itself as a leader in the American animation industry before diversifying into live-action film production, television, and theme parks. The company also operated under the names The Walt Disney Studio, then Walt Disney Productions. Taking on its current name in 1986, it expanded its existing operations and also started divisions focused upon theater, radio, music, publishing, and online media.  - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.  - Random House is the largest general-interest paperback publisher in the world.  As of 2013, it is part of Penguin Random House, which is jointly owned by German media conglomerate Bertelsmann and British global education and publishing company Pearson PLC.  - Alice Borchardt (née Alice Allen O'Brien; October 6, 1939  July 24, 2007) was a writer of historical fiction, fantasy, horror.

In this sentence, the actor played a character named Archie Mullen in the 1996 disaster film \\"Daylight\\" and portrayed a different character, George Tyrell, in the year 2000 film \\"Freedom Song.\\" 2. He appeared as George Tyrell in the 1996 disaster film \\"Daylight\\" and as an archie mullen in the film \\"Freedom Song\\" (2000). This sentence incorrectly switches the characters' names, suggesting that the actor played George Tyrell in the 1996 disaster film \\"Daylight\\" and Archie Mullen in the 2000 film \\"Freedom Song,\\" contradicting the first sentence. Additionally, in the second sentence, the term \\"archie mullen\\" is written in lowercase letters and with an indefinite article 'an,' making it grammatically incorrect. To sum up, although the two sentences convey the same idea about the actor's appearances in two films, there is a mix-up of character names in the second sentence, and it contains a grammatical error.

But remember, this is a job for grown-ups, so make sure an adult is helping you when you try this at home! 1. Secure the pipe firmly in a vise (like a big clamp).    Your grown-up helper should make sure the pipe doesn't move while working on it. It's important to hold it tight in something called a vise, which is like a big strong hand with metal fingers! 2. Put on work gloves and safety glasses.    Just like superheroes wear their costumes, we need to wear special gloves and glasses to stay safe while working. The gloves will protect our hands and the glasses will keep our eyes safe. 3. Cut and clean the pipe.    Now, it's time to cut the pipe using a special tool. After cutting it, your grown-up helper will smooth the rough edges with another special tool called a reamer. This makes the end of the pipe nice and smooth! 4. Choose a die head based on the pipe's diameter.    A die head is like a magical tool that creates threads on the pipe so other parts can attach to it. Your helper will pick the right size die head to match the size of your pipe. 5. Attach the die head to a ratcheting pipe threader handle.    Now your grown-up helper will connect the die head to its best friend, called the ratcheting pipe threader handle. They work together to make the magic threads on the pipe! 6. Lubricate the end of the pipe with threading oil.    Time for some spa treatment! Your helper will put some special oil on the end of the pipe. This makes it easier for the die head to do its magic and create the threads. 7. Place the die head onto the end of the pipe.    Your grown-up helper will now place the die head (with its attached handle) onto the greased-up end of the pipe. 8. Ratchet the handle while applying pressure to the die head to start cutting.    Finally, your helper will move the ratcheting pipe threader handle back and forth. This helps the die head to move around the pipe, cutting those magical threads that we need! And that's it! Now you and your grown-up helper know how to cut and thread a pipe, and you can help others learn about it too. Remember to always stay safe and ask for help when working with tools.

Given the following context:  By the mid-1960s Harrison had become an admirer of Indian culture and mysticism, introducing it to the other Beatles. During the filming of Help! in the Bahamas, they met the founder of Sivananda Yoga, Swami Vishnu-devananda, who gave each of them a signed copy of his book, The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga. Between the end of the last Beatles tour in 1966 and the beginning of the Sgt Pepper recording sessions, he made a pilgrimage to India with his wife Pattie; there, he studied sitar with Ravi Shankar, met several gurus, and visited various holy places. In 1968 he travelled to Rishikesh in northern India with the other Beatles to study meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Harrison's use of psychedelic drugs encouraged his path to meditation and Hinduism. He commented: \\"For me, it was like a flash. The first time I had acid, it just opened up something in my head that was inside of me, and I realized a lot of things. I didn't learn them because I already knew them, but that happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal them. From the moment I had that, I wanted to have it all the time – these thoughts about the yogis and the Himalayas, and Ravi's music.\\"In line with the Hindu yoga tradition, Harrison became a vegetarian in the late 1960s. After being given various religious texts by Shankar in 1966, he remained a lifelong advocate of the teachings of Swami Vivekananda and Paramahansa Yogananda – yogis and authors, respectively, of Raja Yoga and Autobiography of a Yogi. In mid-1969, he produced the single \\"Hare Krishna Mantra\\", performed by members of the London Radha Krishna Temple. Having also helped the Temple devotees become established in Britain, Harrison then met their leader, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, whom he described as \\"my friend ... my master\\" and \\"a perfect example of everything he preached\\". Harrison embraced the Hare Krishna tradition, particularly japa-yoga chanting with beads, and became a lifelong devotee.Regarding other faiths he once remarked: \\"All religions are...  answer the following question:  What is the last name of the person who studied sitar with Ravi Shankar, met several gurus, and visited various holy places?

The figure is disputed by all the major political parties in Sindh. Karachis population grew by 59.8% since the 1998 census to 14.9 million, while Lahore city grew 75.3% – though Karachis census district had not been altered by the provincial government since 1998, while Lahores had been expanded by Punjabs government, leading to some of Karachis growth to have occurred outside the citys census boundaries. Karachis population had grown at a rate of 3.49% between the 1981 and 1998 census, leading many analysts to estimate Karachis 2017 population to be approximately 18 million by extrapolating a continued annual growth rate of 3.49%.

Rabbit travel cages should be rigid, non-collapsible, well-ventilated, and secure to ensure that the rabbit cannot chew through or escape them. Your cage should also have a top opening option to allow nervous rabbits to be removed easily.","output":"Apart from the proper selection of a rabbit carrier, there are multiple factors to consider when planning to transport a rabbit: 1. Preparing the cage: Before placing your rabbit in the travel cage, line it with a soft, absorbent material like newspapers or towels, which will provide comfort and protection from bumps and shocks during transportation. Additionally, you may also want to include a hide or small box for your rabbit to hide in, as this can help them feel secure and reduce stress. 2. Food and water supply: It is essential to provide your rabbit with water and food during transportation, especially if the journey is long. Attach a sturdy water bottle and fill it with fresh water, and include their regular pellets or hay in the cage. However, avoid giving your rabbit vegetables or fruits, as these could lead to an upset stomach during travel. 3. Environment considerations: Rabbits are sensitive creatures, and their travel environment should be as comfortable as possible. Keep the carrier away from direct sunlight, harsh winds, extreme cold or heat, and excessive noise. Maintaining a calm, quiet, and temperature-controlled environment for your rabbit will reduce their stress during transportation. 4. Acclimating to the carrier: Before the trip, allow your rabbit to familiarize themselves with the carrier by placing it in their living space for a few days. This helps the rabbit associate the carrier with a safe and comfortable place, making it easier for them to enter the carrier when the time comes to transport them. 5. Handling and lifting: When moving your rabbit in and out of the carrier, handle them gently to avoid causing injury or stress. Support their body entirely, especially their spine and hind legs. 6. Monitoring your rabbit: During transportation, keep an eye on your rabbit to ensure they are not overly stressed, agitated, or displaying any signs of discomfort. If they appear nervous or frightened, avoid sudden movements or loud noises that could further increase their anxiety. 7. Safe transportation mode: When transporting your rabbit, whether in a car or on public transportation, ensure that the carrier is placed securely and steadily on the floor or seat, with minimal chances of tipping or falling over. This prevents unnecessary distress or harm to your rabbit. 8. Arriving at the destination: Upon arrival at your destination, allow your rabbit time to adjust to their new environment. Give them a quiet place to rest and make sure their living space is safe and comfortable before introducing them to their new surroundings. Ensuring your rabbit's safety and comfort while transporting them is an essential aspect of responsible pet care. It requires planning, preparation, and attention to detail to guarantee a safe and stress-free journey.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Caesar was the youngest of three sons born to Jewish immigrants living in Yonkers, New York. His father was Max Ziser (1874-1946) and his mother was Ida (nee Raphael) (1887-1975). They likely were from Dabrowa Tarnowska, Poland. Reports state that the surname \\"Caesar\\" was given to Max, as a child, by an immigration official at Ellis Island. Caesar's television career began with an appearance on Milton Berle's Texaco Star Theater in the fall of 1948. In early 1949, Caesar and Liebman met with Pat Weaver, vice president of television at NBC, which led to Caesar's first series, Admiral Broadway Revue with Imogene Coca. The Friday show was simultaneously broadcast on NBC and the DuMont network, and was an immediate success. However, its sponsor, Admiral, an appliance company, could not keep up with the demand for its new television sets, so the show was cancelled after 26 weeks--ironically, on account of its runaway success.  On February 25, 1950, Caesar appeared in the first episode of Your Show of Shows, initially the second half of the two-hour umbrella show, Saturday Night Review; at the end of the 1950-51 season, Your Show of Shows became its own, 90-minute program from the Interntional Theatre at 5 Columbus Circle and later The Center Theatre at Sixth Avenue and 49th Street.  Burgess Meredith hosted the first two shows, and the premiere featured musical guests Gertrude Lawrence, Lily Pons and Robert Merrill. The show was a mix of sketch comedy, movie and television satires, Caesar's monologues, musical guests, and large production numbers. Guests included: Jackie Cooper, Robert Preston, Rex Harrison, Eddie Albert, Michael Redgrave, Basil Rathbone, Charlton Heston, Geraldine Page, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Pearl Bailey, Fred Allen, Benny Goodman, Lena Horne and many other stars of the time. It was also responsible for bringing together the comedy team of Caesar, Coca, Carl Reiner, and Howard Morris. Many writers also got their break creating the show's sketches, including Lucille Kallen, Mel Brooks, Neil Simon, Michael Stewart, Mel Tolkin and Sheldon Keller. Sid Caesar won his first Emmy in 1952. In 1951 and 1952, he was voted the United States' Best Comedian in Motion Picture Daily's TV poll. The show ended after almost 160 episodes on June 5, 1954.  A few months later, Caesar returned with Caesar's Hour, a one-hour sketch/variety show with Morris, Reiner, Bea Arthur and other members of his former crew. Nanette Fabray replaced Coca, who had left to star in her own short-lived series. Ultimate creative and technical control was now in Caesar's hands, originating from the Century Theater and the weekly budget doubled to 125,000. The premiere on September 27, 1954, featured Gina Lollobrigida. Everything was performed live, including the commercials.  Caesar's Hour was followed by ABC's short-lived Sid Caesar Invites You from January 26 to May 25, 1958. It briefly reunited Caesar, Coca, and Reiner, with Simon and Brooks among the writers.  In 1963, Caesar appeared on television, on stage, and in the movies. Several As Caesar Sees It specials evolved into the 1963-64 Sid Caesar Show (which alternated with Edie Adams in Here's Edie). He starred with Virginia Martin in the Broadway musical Little Me, with book by Simon, choreography by Bob Fosse, and music by Cy Coleman. Playing eight parts with 32 costume changes, he was nominated in 1963 for a Tony Award for Best Leading Actor in a Musical. On film, Caesar and Adams played a husband and wife drawn into a mad race to find buried loot in the 1963 comedy extravaganza It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did he win any awards?","output":"Yes, Sid Caesar won awards during his career.

You also have a big pile of 96 pebbles next to these cups. Now, if you gave away both the cups and the pile of 96 pebbles, someone would end up with -34 pebbles. We want to find out what number \\"w\\" is in each cup. First, we need to remove these 96 pebbles from the problem, so that we're only left with the cups filled with \\"w\\". To do that, we'll take away 96 pebbles from both sides of the equation. The equation now looks like this: 26*w = -34 - 96 Now if we do the subtraction, we get: 26*w = -130 We still have 26 cups filled with \\"w\\" which is equal to -130 pebbles. But we only want to know what \\"w\\" is in 1 cup. To find out, we need to share the -130 pebbles equally among the 26 cups. In other words, we need to divide -130 pebbles by 26 cups. So the equation becomes: w = -130 / 26 If we do the division, we find out that: w = -5 So, the number \\"w\\" in each cup is -5."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: Where are the highest death rates from asthma found? Context: As of 2011, 235–330 million people worldwide are affected by asthma, and approximately 250,000–345,000 people die per year from the disease. Rates vary between countries with prevalences between 1 and 18%. It is more common in developed than developing countries. One thus sees lower rates in Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa. Within developed countries it is more common in those who are economically disadvantaged while in contrast in developing countries it is more common in the affluent. The reason for these differences is not well known. Low and middle income countries make up more than 80% of the mortality.

Process:  - Water comes through a filter - The filter has small pores to catch pollutants - The filter will catch chlorine, heavy metals, and other chemicals - The filter allows water and mineral ions like fluoride to pass through - The water on the other side of the filter is much cleaner -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less liver working occurs happens, how will it affect HELPING the water purifier to work better.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests considering the possible effects of a scenario where less liver function occurs. To thoroughly examine the potential effects of this situation on the water purification process, we need to analyze the possible direct and indirect connections between liver function and water purification. Direct Connection: There appears to be no direct connection between liver function and the working of a water purifier. A water purifier's primary functions, such as filtering out contaminants and allowing clean water to pass through, are independent of an individual's liver health. As a mechanical device, the water purifier relies on filter membranes, activated carbon, and other physical mechanisms to achieve water purification, rather than involving any biological processes associated with liver function. Indirect Connection: There are, however, some indirect connections that we can consider between liver function and the water purification process. The liver is responsible for detoxification, metabolism, and other vital functions. In a situation where liver function is reduced, an individual would be more vulnerable to the harmful effects of pollutants and contaminants found in unfiltered water or inadequately filtered water. This vulnerability could potentiate the need for an efficient water purification system as a protective measure. In line with this, a water purifier's role in removing harmful substances like chlorine, heavy metals, and chemicals is crucial in protecting an individual with compromised liver function from additional toxin exposure. Consequently, the demand for efficient and effective water purifiers may increase in this case, highlighting the importance of water purification technology in maintaining good health, particularly for individuals who are more susceptible to the negative effects of water contaminants. In conclusion, while there is no direct impact of the perturbation hypothesis on the water purification process itself, the indirect connection highlights the significance of the water purifier's role in protecting those with reduced liver function from additional exposure to toxins and maintaining overall well-being. This emphasizes the importance of water purification technology in ensuring access to clean and safe drinking water, which is essential for everyone, regardless of their liver health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

All that sunlight was fantastic for Mom's vegetable garden. Working in the garden at midnight tended to throw her timing off, so she didn't care much about my bedtime. Dad was a Railway Express agent and Mom was his clerk. That left me in a mess. I usually managed to find some trouble to get into. Once I had a little Are going in the dirt basement of a hotel.

First, let's consider the premise: \\"A man flips in the air before a crowd of onlookers.\\" This tells us that the man is performing an acrobatic act in front of an audience. He is in motion and airborne. 2. As for the hypothesis: \\"The man is seated at a table\\". This implies that the man is seated, hence not in motion, and located at a table, likely indoors. 3. Now let's compare these two statements. The premise implies that the man is in action, performing an airborne flip, while the hypothesis implies a still and seated position at a table. 4. The clear contrast between the dynamic scenario described in the premise and the static situation described in the hypothesis makes it extremely unlikely that the man could be performing an acrobatic flip in the air and simultaneously seated at a table. In conclusion, we cannot say that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. The conditions of these two statements are diametrically opposed as they suggest entirely different scenarios.

Determine the sentiment: Return to the 36th Chamber is one of those classic Kung-Fu movies which Shaw produces back in the 70s and 80s, whose genre is equivalent to the spaghetti westerns of Hollywood, and the protagonist Gordon Liu, the counterpart to the western's Clint Eastwood. Digitally remastered and a new print made for the Fantastic Film Fest, this is \\"Presented in Shaw Scope\\", just like the good old days. This film is a simple story of good versus evil, told in 3 acts, which more or less sums up the narrative of martial arts films in that era. Act One sets up the premise. Workers in a dye-mill of a small village are unhappy with their lot, having their wages cut by 20% by incoming manchu gangsters. They can't do much about their exploitation because none of them are martial arts skilled to take on the gangsters, and their boss. At first they had a minor success in getting Liu to impersonate a highly skilled Shaolin monk (one of the best comedy sequences), but their rouse got exposed when they pushed the limit of credibility by impersonating one too many times. Act Two shows the protagonist wanting to get back at the mob. However, without real martial arts, he embarks on a journey to Shaolin Temple, to try and infiltrate and learn martial arts on the sly. After some slapstick moments, he finally gets accepted by the abbot (whom he impersonated!) but is disappointed at the teaching methods - kinda like Mr Miyagi's style in Karate Kid, but instead of painting fences, he gets to erect scaffoldings all around the temple. Nothing can keep a good man down, and he unwittingly builds strength, endurance and learns kung-fu the unorthodox way. Act Three is where the fight fest begins. With cheesy sound effects, each obvious non-contact on film is given the maximum impact treatment. But it is rather refreshing watching the fight scenes here, with its wide angled shots to highlight clarity and detail between the sparring partners, and the use of slow-motion only to showcase stunts in different angles. You may find the speed of fights a tad too slow, with some pause in between moves, but with Yuen Wo Ping and his style being used ad-nausem in Hollywood flicks, they sure don't make fight scenes like they used to!

To become a successful poker player, it is essential to understand the hand rankings, the rules of play, and the betting process. In this article, we will break down the key elements of poker to guide you on your journey towards becoming a skilled player. Step 1: Learn the Hand Rankings Poker revolves around making the best possible hand out of the cards dealt to you. There are 10 different possible hand types, ranked from the highest value to the lowest. Familiarizing yourself with these hand rankings is the first critical step to playing poker. 1. Royal Flush 2. Straight Flush 3. Four of a Kind 4. Full House 5. Flush 6. Straight 7. Three of a Kind 8. Two Pair 9. One Pair 10. High Card The better your hand, the higher your chances of winning. Each type of hand has a specific strength, and these strengths are used to determine the winner in the event of a tie. Step 2: Agree on the Rules of Play Players should decide on the rules of play and the variant of poker that they'd like to play. There are numerous poker variations, such as Texas Hold'em, Omaha, and Seven-Card Stud. Each game has its unique set of rules, and agreeing on the chosen variant will set the groundwork for the game. Step 3: Deal One Card to Each Player The dealer shuffles the deck and deals one card to each player, starting with the player to their left, in a clockwise direction. This process helps determine the first round of betting. Step 4: The Player on the Dealer's Left May Place a Bet The first player to act is the person sitting to the dealer's left. They have the option of placing a bet or passing the betting responsibility to the next player. When a bet has been made, play continues clockwise, as the betting action moves to the next player. Step 5: Deal a Second Card and Begin the Second Round of Betting Once all remaining players have \\"called,\\" or matched the highest bet, the dealer deals a second card. Players now have two cards in their hands and may place another bet, going through a similar betting process as in the initial round. Step 6: Deal a Third Card and Repeat the Betting Process The dealer now deals a third card to each player, followed by another round of betting. Players should assess the strength of their hands in relation to the visible cards on the table and available information about their opponents' hands. Step 7: Reveal All Hands Once all the rounds of betting have been completed, players reveal their hands. The winner is the person with the highest-ranking hand, according to the hand rankings outlined earlier. Step 8: The Winner Takes the Pot The player with the best hand collects the pot, which contains all bets placed during the game. Step 9: Rotate Dealers and Play Another Round Dealing responsibilities rotate to the next player on the left, and a new round commences. This process continues until players decide to stop playing. Conclusion Poker's popularity stems from its blend of strategy, skill, and the thrill of the unknown. Mastering the hand rankings, the rules of play, and the betting process allows players to maximize their potential and increase their chances of success at the table. As with any game, practice makes perfect – so grab a deck and start honing your skills to become a formidable poker player."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

With regulations in place and DDT banned, the eagle population rebounded. The bald eagle can be found in growing concentrations throughout the United States and Canada, particularly near large bodies of water. In the early 1980s, the estimated total population was 100,000 individuals, with 110,000–115,000 by 1992; the U.S. state with the largest resident population is Alaska, with about 40,000–50,000, with the next highest population the Provinces and territories of Canada of British Columbia with 20,000–30,000 in 1992. Obtaining a precise count of bald eagles population is extremely difficult. The most recent data submitted by individual states was in 2006, when 9789 breeding pairs were reported. For some time, the stronghold breeding population of bald eagles in the lower 48 states was in Florida, where over a thousand pairs have held on while populations in other states were significantly reduced by DDT use. Today, the Contiguous United States with the largest number of breeding pairs of eagles is Minnesota with an estimated 1,312 pairs, surpassing Floridas most recent count of 1,166 pairs. 23, or nearly half, of the 48 contiguous states now have at least 100 breeding pairs of bald eagles. In Washington State, there were only 105 occupied nests in 1980.  That number increased by about 30 per year, so that by 2005 there were 840 occupied nests. 2005 was the last year that the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife counted occupied nests. Further population increases in Washington may be limited by the availability of late winter food, particularly salmon. Based on the above article, answer a question.

Q: Facebook has a long track record and sordid history of abusing their users’ trust and privacy, including the most recent and egregious cases currently making headlines with Cambridge Analytica as well as election meddling in the US and Britain. As if that wasn’t enough, it then came to light that they have also been tracking and storing users’ phone call and text message data, including “who contacted whom, what time, and how long the conversation was.” This is nothing new, as we can see from this 2012 “study” in which they deliberately manipulated news feeds to influence users’ emotional state. And again with their settlement with the FCC back in 2011 (that they likely violated with their recent offenses) over deceiving consumers by telling them their information was private, but then repeatedly sharing it and making it public. And then there’s The Ugly Memo, in which a FB exec justifies growth at any cost in the name of connecting people, even if that results literally in people dying: We talk about the good and the bad of our work often. I want to talk about the ugly. We connect people. That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. And still we connect people. The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good. And up until this most recent Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook was negotiating with various healthcare organizations to share patients’ health data with FB so they could match it up to your social circle to allegedly provide better health care. Um yeah right. Each time this stuff happens, they issue an apology (or a justification for their behavior) and promise they will take steps to better inform users and protect their privacy, but it’s clear that this is just lip service at this point. According to the above context, answer the following question. How did the facebook exec try to justify the Ugly memo? A:","output":"The Facebook exec tried to justify the Ugly Memo by emphasizing their deep belief in connecting people.

The California fertility doctor who implanted a dozen embryos in Nadya Suleman, resulting in the birth of eight babies, will lose his medical license on July 1, state officials said. The California Medical Board ruled that Dr. Michael Kamrava committed \\"gross negligence\\" with \\"repeated negligent acts, for an excessive number of embryo transfers\\" into Suleman in 2008. Suleman -- known in the media as \\"Octomom\\" -- was 33 when she gave birth to eight babies in January 2009. She was a single woman who already had six young children conceived through in-vitro fertilization administered by Kamrava. Kamrava, who began treating Suleman in 1997, said Suleman demanded all 12 embryos that were available for the procedure. The doctor \\"did not think he could refuse to transfer less embryos than those to which N.S. would agree because he believe at the time that the ultimate decision should be largely driven by the patient's wishes,\\" the board wrote in the decision released Wednesday. \\"While the evidence did not establish (Kamrava) as a maverick or deviant physician, oblivious to standards of care in IVF practices, it certainly demonstrated that he did not exercise sound judgment in the transfer of 12 embryos to patient N.S. (Suleman),\\" the board wrote. His lawyer argued during a hearing last October that Kamrava has been \\"a respected, excellent physician and surgeon for 25 years,\\" but that he \\"ran into sort of a perfect storm with one of his patients.\\" Kamrava was also found guilty of gross negligence in two other cases, including his treatment of a woman on her late 40s who became pregnant with quadruplets after he implanted seven embryos. Her pregnancy was \\"rocked with complications,\\" according to the medical board. Another case was a missed cancer diagnosis for a patient with an abnormal lab report. It was revealed during Kamrava's revocation hearing last October that Suleman still has 29 frozen embryos in storage available for her use should she want more children. The complaint said the doctor should have referred Suleman to a mental health physician after she repeatedly returned to him for treatments shortly after each of her pregnancies. Kamrava, an obstetrician/gynecologist in Beverly Hills, California, was expelled from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine in 2009 for what the fertility medical society called \\"a pattern of behavior that violated the group's standards.\\" The society recommends implanting no more than two embryos for women under 35 and no more than five for women over 40 -- who have more trouble getting pregnant -- according to guidelines published on its website. Giving birth to extreme multiples comes with tremendous risks for the mother and the babies, including \\"complications with pregnancy, prematurity and long-term consequences of that,\\" Dr. Victor Fujimoto, an expert witness called by the medical board, testified. Suleman's children -- six boys and two girls born nine weeks premature -- all went home after an extended stay in the hospital. While there has been no indication any problems have emerged, \\"we still don't know,\\" Fujimoto said. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"1. The California Medical Board has announced that Dr. Michael Kamrava, a fertility doctor, will lose his medical license as of July 1 due to \\"gross negligence\\" and \\"repeated negligent acts\\".  2. This decision is primarily based on the case of Nadya Suleman, who Kamrava implanted with an excessive number of embryos in 2008, resulting in the birth of eight babies. This act breached recommended standards of embryo implantation.  3. Suleman, a single mother also known as the \\"Octomom\\", already had six children through in-vitro fertilization administered by Kamrava before the birth of her octuplets.  4. The Board's decision acknowledges that Kamrava is not a \\"maverick or deviant physician\\" but his judgment was flawed regarding the transfer of a large number of embryos to Suleman.  5. Kamrava was found guilty of gross negligence in two other cases, including causing a woman in her late 40s to become pregnant with quadruplets after implanting seven embryos and missing a cancer diagnosis. 6. Suleman has 29 frozen embryos in storage for her future use and the Board suggested that the doctor should have referred Suleman to a mental health physician after she repeatedly returned for treatments.  7. Kamrava was expelled from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine in 2009 for a pattern of behavior violating the group's standards. The society advises on the appropriate number of embryos to implant according to the patient's age.  8. Giving birth to multiple children can lead to numerous health risks for both the mother and the babies. Despite potential health risks, Suleman's eight children – six boys and two girls – were all able to go home after an extended stay in hospital. However, potential long-term impacts are still unknown."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Researchers think that protection against the illness comes from a key chemical inside the fruit known as lycopene. Tomato-based pasta sauce, tomato juice and even baked beans and the tomato puree topping on pizza were all found to have a beneficial effect. Tomatoes are rich in the compound lycopene, which has previously been linked to good prostate health. And men who doubled their intake of fruit and vegetables to the recommended five portions a day reduced their risk by nearly a quarter, say scientists. In the first study of its kind, researchers from the Universities of Bristol, Cambridge and Oxford examined the diets and lifestyles of nearly 14,000 men aged 50 to 69. They found that those who ate at least ten portions of tomatoes a week were 18 per cent less likely to develop prostate cancer compared to those who had none, or very few. One portion counted as 150g of tomatoes, half a tin of baked beans, a portion of pizza with tomato puree, tomato-based pasta sauce or a glass of tomato juice. However, the researchers urged men not to overindulge in baked beans, pizza and pasta sauce as they can contain high levels of salt. Prostate cancer is the most common form of the illness in men, with 41,700 new cases and 10,700 deaths in the UK every year. Experts suspect it may be linked to the Western diet because it is far less common in countries of the developing world. Research leader Vanessa Er, of the University of Bristol, said: ‘Our findings suggest that tomatoes may be important in prostate cancer prevention. ‘We also found men who ate more fruits and vegetables had a reduced risk of prostate cancer. The risk reduction figure for men who ate five or more portions of fruit or vegetables, compared to those who ate less than two and a half portions, was 24 per cent.’ She urged men to rely on whole foods rather than supplements and stick to a diet that includes a variety of fruits and vegetables, as well as staying healthy and active and maintaining ‘an ideal weight’. Portions of tomatoes can also include tomato juice and baked beans, say the researchers. However, experts said there was not enough evidence for conclusive proof that tomatoes protected against prostate cancer. Dr Iain Frame, of Prostate Cancer UK said: ‘Studies like these are notoriously difficult to interpret and should be done so with extreme caution. ‘It is difficult to separate the effects of one type of food from another, and we still don’t have nearly enough evidence to make concrete recommendations on which specific foods men should eat to reduce their risk of prostate cancer. The study says men should aim for:. * 10 or more portions of tomatoes a week. *  Between 750mg and 1,200mg of calcium a day. * Between 105mcg to 200mcg of selenium daily. ‘What we do know is that men shouldn’t rely too heavily on one type of food, such as tomatoes. ‘A healthy, balanced diet with plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables together with regular exercise is by far the best option.’ Commenting on the study, Dr Iain Frame, Director of Research at Prostate Cancer UK said: 'Studies like these are notoriously difficult to interpret and should be done so with extreme caution.

A cabinet is a piece of furniture with doors, drawers, and/or shelves used to store or display items. Cabinets come in various sizes, shapes, and designs, including wall-mounted and freestanding units. The primary purpose of a cabinet is to provide organized, protected, and accessible storage for a variety of items, such as dishes, glassware, clothing, books, or tools. An enclosed shelf within a cabinet ensures that the stored items are protected from dust, dirt, and possible damage. Moreover, it helps to maintain a clean and tidy appearance in the room where the cabinet is located. Enclosed shelves can be made from various materials, such as wood, metal, or glass, and may have doors or other means of closure to keep the contents secure and discreet. B. A mortuary is a facility that handles deceased individuals' storage, preparation, and final arrangements before burial or cremation. Although a mortuary may have shelves for storing equipment and supplies, these shelves are not usually enclosed in the same way cabinets are. C. A bookstore primarily houses books for sale, displayed on open shelves or racks for easy browsing by customers. While some bookstores may have cabinets for securing valuable or rare editions, the majority of their shelves are open for quick access. D. A school building is a complex made up of various rooms, such as classrooms, offices, and other facilities. Shelving and storage within a school can be diverse, including lockers, storage rooms, and bookshelves. However, enclosed shelves are not as commonly associated with a school building as they are with cabinets. E. A bedroom is a room in which people sleep and may contain furniture like beds, dressers, and nightstands. While bedrooms often have shelves for storing books, clothing, or other items, these are not typically enclosed like a cabinet. Bedrooms may contain cabinets, but the emphasis is on other essential furniture like beds and wardrobes. Therefore, the best answer is A: cabinet, as it is the most likely of these options to have an enclosed shelf for storage and display purposes. Cabinets are versatile furniture pieces designed to provide secure and organized storage, making them perfectly suited for enclosed shelves."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Question: \\"In what aspect is the coincidence of broadcast bands advantageous?\\"  Context: \\"Frequencies for COMPASS are allocated in four bands: E1, E2, E5B, and E6 and overlap with Galileo. The fact of overlapping could be convenient from the point of view of the receiver design, but on the other hand raises the issues of inter-system interference, especially within E1 and E2 bands, which are allocated for Galileo's publicly regulated service. However, under International Telecommunication Union (ITU) policies, the first nation to start broadcasting in a specific frequency will have priority to that frequency, and any subsequent users will be required to obtain permission prior to using that frequency, and otherwise ensure that their broadcasts do not interfere with the original nation's broadcasts. It now appears that Chinese COMPASS satellites will start transmitting in the E1, E2, E5B, and E6 bands before Europe's Galileo satellites and thus have primary rights to these frequency ranges.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The coincidence of broadcast bands between COMPASS and Galileo can be advantageous primarily in terms of receiver design and interoperability. By having overlapping frequency bands, it becomes possible to create multi-constellation receivers capable of processing signals from both navigation systems. This has several benefits. 1. Improved Positioning Accuracy: By receiving and processing signals from both COMPASS and Galileo satellites, the receiver can obtain more precise and accurate positioning information. This is because the additional satellite data can help minimize the impact of errors in satellite position or measurements. 2. Greater Reliability and Availability: As the dual receiver system utilizes two separate constellation networks, it can provide more consistent positioning services. In the event of a constellation-wide issue with one system, the other system will still be operational, ensuring continuous service. 3. Enhanced Redundancy: Similarly, the overlapping frequency bands can improve redundancy in the receiver system, particularly in challenging environments like urban canyons or under heavy tree cover where signals from certain satellites might be blocked or degraded. In such situations, the availability of signals from both COMPASS and Galileo satellites can significantly improve positioning performance. 4. Cost Savings and Simplification: Developing a single receiver that can process signals from both COMPASS and Galileo can also be more cost-effective and efficient compared to creating separate receivers for each system. This integration simplifies the design and reduces the need for additional hardware components. However, the potential downside of overlapping frequency bands primarily revolves around inter-system interference, which can degrade signal quality and adversely affect positioning accuracy. To address this issue, countries are required to follow ITU policies that set priority rules for frequency usage and ensure non-interference with previous nation's broadcasts. In summary, the coincidence of broadcast bands between COMPASS and Galileo is advantageous in terms of improved receiver design, enhanced positioning accuracy, increased reliability and availability, and reduced costs. Nonetheless, it's crucial to effectively manage inter-system interference to ensure optimal performance of both navigation systems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He noticed that in France they use atmosphere and Pascal as pressure units. In Germany they use torr as a pressure unit. Back in the United States, he noticed psi is used as a pressure unit. He needs to figure out how they correlate with each other.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which county is using a unit mesured with millimeter, Germany or United States?  Hint: Pressures are given in a multitude of units. We've already discussed Pascals, and we know that another unit for pressure is the atmosphere (1 atm = 101.3 x 10 5 Pa). The third commonly used pressure unit is the torr (symbol Torr). 760 torr is 1 atm, but 1 torr is also the increase in pressure necessary to cause liquid mercury to rise by 1 mm. For that reason, torr is also commonly referred to as \\"millimeters mercury.\\" Another pressure unit commonly used in our everyday world is psi, or pounds per square inch, though neither psi nor torr are SI units. The answer to this question is:","output":"Germany. The pressure unit used in Germany, as mentioned, is the torr. The torr is also commonly referred to as \\"millimeters mercury\\" because a 1 torr increase in pressure causes a rise in the height of a column of mercury by 1 millimeter. Therefore, Germany is the country that uses a pressure unit measured with millimeter, not the United States. The United States commonly uses psi, or pounds per square inch, a different unit of pressure measurement.  To deepen our understanding, let's explain a bit more about these pressure units. 1. Torr: This unit is widely used in the fields of vacuum physics and engineering. It was named after Evangelista Torricelli, an Italian physicist and mathematician who is credited with inventing the barometer. The unit is defined as exactly 1/760 of a standard atmosphere. Thus, 1 Torr is approximately 133.322 pascals. 2. Atmosphere (atm): This is a unit of pressure defined as 101325 pascals. It is approximately the atmospheric pressure on Earth at sea level. 3. Pascal (Pa): This is the SI unit for pressure. One pascal is defined as one newton per square meter. 4. Psi: This stands for \\"pound-force per square inch.\\" It is a unit of pressure widely used in the US and measures the pressure resulting from a force of one pound-force applied to an area of one square inch. In conclusion, each country uses different pressure units based on their convention, scientific and engineering practices. For John, it's crucial to understand these different units to better appreciate and comprehend his experiences as a world traveler. Remembering that 1 torr equals 1 mmHg can also be helpful when converting between different units of pressure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

They were led by a man named Tavon 'Bulldog' White. They were in charge of many things that happened in the jail, even though they were not the people who were supposed to be taking care of the place. The person in charge, Bulldog, had a lot to say about what happened during his time in the jail. He told people in a big place called court that his group, the Black Guerilla Family, had made special positions in the jail. These positions let the people there be in control of what happened inside the jail. Bulldog said that even though there were guards to watch over the inmates, it was the gang, not the guards, who had the ultimate say in how things went inside the facility. This is a big surprise because it's usually police officers and guards who are supposed to be in charge of making sure everyone follows the rules. Right now, there are some people who have to face the consequences of what happened at the Baltimore City Detention Center.

He made more than 250 recordings, including 45 complete opera sets. During the 1950s and 1960s Decca had an alliance with RCA Victor, and some of Solti's recordings were first issued on the RCA label.Solti was one of the first conductors who came to international fame as a recording artist before being widely known in the concert hall or opera house. Gordon Parry, the Decca engineer who worked with Solti and Culshaw on the Ring recordings, observed, \\"Many people have said 'Oh well, of course John Culshaw made Solti.' This is not true. He gave him the opportunity to show what he could do.\\"Solti's first recordings were as a piano accompanist, playing at sessions in Zurich for the violinist Georg Kulenkampff in 1947. Decca's senior producer, Victor Olof did not much admire Solti as a conductor (nor did Walter Legge, Olof's opposite number at EMI's Columbia Records), but Olof's younger colleague and successor, Culshaw, held Solti in high regard. As Culshaw, and later James Walker, produced his recordings, Solti's career as a recording artist flourished from the mid-1950s. Among the orchestras with whom Solti recorded were the Berlin Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony, London Philharmonic, London Symphony and Vienna Philharmonic orchestras. Soloists in his operatic recordings included Birgit Nilsson, Joan Sutherland, Régine Crespin, Plácido Domingo, Gottlob Frick, Carlo Bergonzi, Kiri Te Kanawa and José van Dam. In concerto recordings, Solti conducted for, among others, András Schiff, Julius Katchen, Clifford Curzon, Vladimir Ashkenazy and Kyung-wha Chung.Solti's most celebrated recording was Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen made in Vienna, produced by Culshaw, between 1958 and 1965.

Question: WHAT COUNTRY IS MEXICO IN Answer:","output":"The original question (WHAT COUNTRY IS MEXICO IN) seeks to understand the national or regional context of Mexico. Mexico itself is a country and thus, it is not within another country. The given answer provides some historical context regarding the inception of Mexico, but it does not directly answer the question. Therefore, I will provide a more comprehensive answer to the original question below. Mexico is a country located in the southern part of North America, with the United States to the north, the Pacific Ocean to the south and west, Belize and Guatemala to the southeast, and the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea to the east. The question \\"What country is Mexico in?\\" may cause some confusion, as it implies that Mexico is a part of another country, which is not correct. Mexico is an independent nation and, in fact, the third largest country in the Americas, after the United States and Brazil. Mexico has a rich history that spans thousands of years, originating from the various indigenous civilizations that inhabited the region, such as the Mayans, Aztecs, and many others. The arrival of the Spanish conquistadors in the 16th century marked the beginning of European colonization and the creation of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, which was ruled by the Spanish Empire. The territory mentioned in the given answer refers to this particular period in Mexican history. Over the years, tension grew among the colonists, and the desire for autonomy and independence manifested itself through insurrections and uprisings. The Mexican War of Independence, which began in 1810 and lasted for over a decade, ultimately led to the recognition of Mexico's independence in 1821, as mentioned in the provided answer. This event marked the birth of modern Mexico as an independent nation. In the years that followed, Mexico underwent several significant transformations, including territorial changes, political and economic shifts, and cultural developments. Today, Mexico stands as a sovereign and diverse country, boasting a unique blend of Mesoamerican and European traditions, and is the 11th most populous nation globally. Thus, to answer the original question, Mexico is not in another country. Instead, it is a country located in North America with its distinct cultural, historical, and political identity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: When you were young, ginger ale may have been a popular choice for reducing the unpleasant feelings caused by your upset stomach on the road to get to school. For years, ginger has been used to reduce the effects of nausea . But do you know it's now also being looked at to fight cancer? Scientists have discovered that ginger can kill cancerous cells in two different ways. On the one hand, ginger causes the cancer cells to \\"commit suicide\\" by destroying themselves while leaving the surrounding healthy cells untouched. Ginger can prevent the growth of diseased cells by destroying the environment they grow in. On the other hand, ginger tricks the diseased cells and causes them to fight among themselves. Researchers are now looking into one of the toughest cancers to fight. However, scientists find repeated treatment of disease by drugs can actually lose its effectiveness over time as the cancer builds up resistance to the same treatment. This raises researchers' confidence that ginger would help stop resistance from the cancer. In a study, the cancer clearly stopped growing in the body of the mice that had been given ginger. The bad news is that such encouraging research has only been conducted on mice. The good news, however, is that it seems humans might be able to get the same benefit just by eating products with ginger and ginger root in them. Cancer prevention and fighting abilities aren't the only potential benefits you may get from adding a bit more ginger to your diet. Drinking ginger ale when your stomach was upset as a child wasn't just a placebo .Numerous studies and research, including the Mayo Clinic's strict grading system, agree that ginger has some sort of anti-nausea characteristics. Some believe that ginger works well against nausea after operations, while others use it to reduce motion sickness such as seasickness and car sickness. The Mayo Clinic, however, advises the use of ginger only to reduce nausea during pregnancy. While more research needs to be done, early studies are very promising,...

When a molten metal is mixed with another substance, there are two mechanisms that can cause an alloy to form, called atom exchange and the interstitial mechanism. The relative size of each element in the mix plays a primary role in determining which mechanism will occur. When the atoms are relatively similar in size, the atom exchange method usually happens, where some of the atoms composing the metallic crystals are substituted with atoms of the other constituent. This is called a substitutional alloy. Examples of substitutional alloys include bronze and brass, in which some of the copper atoms are substituted with either tin or zinc atoms. With the interstitial mechanism, one atom is usually much smaller than the other, so cannot successfully replace an atom in the crystals of the base metal. The smaller atoms become trapped in the spaces between the atoms in the crystal matrix, called the interstices. This is referred to as an interstitial alloy. Steel is an example of an interstitial alloy, because the very small carbon atoms fit into interstices of the iron matrix. Stainless steel is an example of a combination of interstitial and substitutional alloys, because the carbon atoms fit into the interstices, but some of the iron atoms are replaced with nickel and chromium atoms.

The story is based on a novel of the same name by author Michael Hornburg, published in 2001, and the film adaptation was released in 2015.  Downers Grove is depicted as a typical American suburb, with a close-knit community, tree-lined streets, schools, parks, and various businesses. However, the town holds a dark secret – a supposed curse that affects the local high school. The curse dates back to the 1990s, when a series of deaths and unfortunate accidents began to occur in the run-up to graduation each year, claiming the lives of seniors at Downers Grove North High School. The town, immersed in superstition, interprets these tragic events as a manifestation of the curse, which became a local legend over time. The film adaptation mainly focuses on the experiences of Chrissie Swanson, a high school senior, as she navigates her way through the final weeks leading up to graduation. As the curse looms over the school, Chrissie and her friends begin to suspect that they could be the next victims of this terrifying tradition. Throughout the movie, various locations in Downers Grove serve as the backdrop for the story, including the characters' homes, parks, suburban streets, and the high school itself. The overall setting plays an essential role in creating a sinister atmosphere that contrasts with the idyllic suburban image. The ordinary appearance of the town helps to enhance the tension and terror that arises from the unfolding of events. The choice of Downers Grove, Illinois, as the location for both the novel and film creates an eerie, intriguing environment that plays on the viewers' and readers' fears and convictions about supernatural myths and legends that can sometimes grip small towns. By exploring the relationships between the characters and their reactions to the town's urban legend, the story delves into the psychological impact of such unexplained occurrences and connects them with the inherent fear of the unknown that is shared by many people across various cultures and communities."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a question about this article: The vast majority of living organisms encode their genes in long strands of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). DNA consists of a chain made from four types of nucleotide subunits, each composed of: a five-carbon sugar (2'-deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and one of the four bases adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine.:2.1 What is the answer to this question: What does DNA consist of?","output":"DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a fundamental molecule in all living organisms that carries genetic information essential for growth, development, and reproduction. It is a complex, double-helical structure that contains vital instructions for the synthesis of proteins and the regulation of various cellular processes. DNA consists of three main components: a five-carbon sugar called 2'-deoxyribose, a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogen-containing bases, which are adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine. 1. 2'-Deoxyribose: This five-carbon sugar is the backbone of the DNA molecule and plays a crucial role in the formation of the characteristic helical structure. The sugar is named 2'-deoxyribose due to the lack of a hydroxyl group (-OH) on the 2' carbon atom compared to the ribose sugar present in RNA (ribonucleic acid). This difference not only distinguishes DNA from RNA but also adds stability to the DNA molecule, making it less susceptible to hydrolysis and cellular degradation. 2. Phosphate Group: The phosphate group, which consists of a phosphorus atom bonded to four oxygen atoms, is another essential component of DNA. Phosphate groups serve as the connecting link between consecutive deoxyribose sugars in each strand of DNA and are important in the formation of the sugar-phosphate backbone. The phosphate groups in DNA exhibit a negative charge due to their functional groups, conferring an overall negative charge to the DNA molecule. This charge ensures the molecule's solubility in the cell's aqueous environment and facilitates its interactions with other cellular macromolecules, such as enzymes and proteins. 3. Nitrogenous Bases: Four different nitrogen-containing bases in DNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). Each of these bases is covalently bonded to the 1' carbon of the deoxyribose sugar in their respective nucleotide. In the DNA double helix, these bases form a complementary base pairing where adenine pairs with thymine (A-T), while cytosine pairs with guanine (C-G). This complementary base pairing is governed by the specific hydrogen bonding between the bases, where adenine and thymine form two hydrogen bonds, and cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen bonds. The precise pairing of these bases is crucial for maintaining the stability of the double helix, the accurate replication of DNA during cell division, and the proper transcription of genetic information to produce RNA molecules. In conclusion, DNA is a complex biomolecule that primarily consists of three components: a five-carbon sugar (2'-deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and one of the four nitrogenous bases (adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine). These elements work together to create a stable double-helical structure that stores the genetic information necessary for the proper functioning and reproduction of living organisms. Moreover, the unique properties and precise organization of these components ensure the accurate transmission of genetic data from one generation to the next and their successful translation into functional proteins and cellular processes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Condorman Movie plot: Woodrow \\"Woody\\" Wilkins is an imaginative, yet eccentric, comic book writer and illustrator who demands a sense of realism for his comic book hero \\"Condorman\\", to the point where he crafts a Condorman flying suit of his own and launches himself off the Eiffel Tower. The test flight fails as his right wing breaks, sending him crashing into the Seine River. Later after the incident, Woody is asked by his friend, CIA file clerk Harry, to perform what appears to be a civilian paper swap in Istanbul. Upon arriving in Istanbul, he meets a beautiful Soviet named Natalia Rambova, who poses as the Soviet civilian with whom the exchange is supposed to take place, but it is later revealed that she is in fact a KGB spy. Woody does not tell Natalia his real name, and instead fabricates his identity to her as a top American agent code-named \\"Condorman\\". During the encounter, Woody fends off a group of would-be assassins and saves her life by sheer luck before accomplishing the paper trade. Impressed by Woody, and disgusted by how she was treated by her lover/boss Krokov when she returns to Moscow, Natalia decides to defect and asks the CIA to have \\"Condorman\\" be the agent that helps her.Back in Paris, Woody's encounter with Natalia inspires him to create a super heroine patterned after her named \\"Laser Lady\\". He is then notified by Harry and his boss Russ that he is to escort a defecting Soviet agent known as \\"The Bear\\". Woody refuses to do the job, but when Russ reveals that \\"The Bear\\" is Natalia, he agrees to do it on the condition that the CIA provides him with gadgetry based on his designs.Woody meets up with Natalia in Yugoslavia and protects her from Krokov's henchmen led by the homicidal, glass-eyed assassin Morovich. After joining Harry in Italy, the trio venture to Switzerland, where Natalia discovers the truth about Woody when a group of children recognize her from his comic books. Their journey back to France is compromised when Morovich puts Woody and Harry out of commission and Krokov's men recover Natalia...","output":"Woodrow's nickname is \\"Woody\\"."},{"instruction":"Jan saw Alex felt better after he was sick.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"To put deodorant on, just follow these simple steps: 1. First, make sure your underarms are clean and dry. You can do this by taking a bath or a shower and then drying your armpits properly with a towel. 2. Next, take the cap off the deodorant. If it's a roll-on, give it a little shake to make sure the liquid is ready to come out. If it's a stick, twist the bottom part to raise the deodorant up a little bit. 3. Now, gently apply the deodorant to your underarm area. For a roll-on, roll the ball back and forth a few times across your underarm. For a stick, smoothly glide it across your armpit. 4. Make sure you cover the entire underarm area. This will help prevent any smelly odors. 5. Finally, let the deodorant dry for a moment before putting on your clothes. This helps the deodorant work better and not get on your clothes.

Former Manchester United keeper says he 'bleeds blue'","output":"Title: Tim Howard Rejects MLS Return, Commits Future to Everton Everton's long-serving goalkeeper, Tim Howard, has ended speculation surrounding his future by signing a new four-year deal with the Premier League club, effectively ruling out any potential return to Major League Soccer (MLS). The 35-year-old USA international has opted to continue his career in England, where he has established himself as one of the most reliable and respected custodians in the top-flight. The veteran stopper, who spent time at Manchester United earlier in his career, revealed his deep affection for the Merseyside outfit and insists that he \\"bleeds blue\\". Howard's decision to extend his stay at Goodison Park is a massive vote of confidence in the club's direction and ambitions amidst recent rumors of interest from MLS clubs. Following a successful World Cup campaign with the U.S. Men's National Team in 2014, during which he recorded a record-breaking 16 saves in a single match against Belgium, there was speculation that Howard might be tempted to return to his homeland and finish his career in the fast-growing MLS. In an official statement released by Everton, Tim Howard expressed his delight at signing the contract extension, stating, \\"I couldn't be happier to have signed a new deal at Everton. I've enjoyed the last ten years at this club enormously, and I truly believe that we have the potential to achieve even greater things in the coming seasons. I bleed blue, and to have the opportunity to continue representing this fantastic club is a huge honor for me.\\" The importance of Howard's decision to commit to Everton should not be underestimated. Over the past decade, he has been a near ever-present between the sticks for the Toffees, making over 400 appearances in all competitions. Throughout his tenure, Howard has demonstrated outstanding professionalism and consistency, regularly being ranked amongst the Premier League's top shot-stoppers. Everton manager Roberto Martinez expressed his satisfaction at securing Howard's future, emphasizing the key role that he anticipates the experienced goalkeeper will continue to play in the development of the side. Speaking in a press conference, Martinez said, \\"Tim is not only an exceptional goalkeeper, but he is also a great leader and character to have around the dressing room. His decision to sign a new deal is indicative of his unwavering commitment to Everton, and a testament to his belief in our project.\\" While some may have anticipated that, at this stage of his career, Howard might have been tempted to return to MLS and enjoy a potentially lucrative swansong in the United States, his decision to remain at Everton is a reflection of his love for the club. As a player who once claimed that he would have joined Everton for free after leaving Manchester United, Howard's loyalty to the Toffees remains unwavering. In an era where player loyalty is often blighted by the allure of money and fame, Tim Howard's decision to snub MLS and continue his journey with Everton serves as a refreshing example of dedication. Having made the bold move to join Everton a decade ago, Howard has carved out a distinguished career on Merseyside, and in doing so, has ensured his place in the club's rich history. By signing this new four-year deal, Howard will no doubt hope to add further chapters to his already impressive Everton story, while passionately continuing to bleed blue."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Louis Leo Holtz (born January 6, 1937) is a former American football player, coach, and analyst. He served as the head football coach at The College of William & Mary (1969-1971), North Carolina State University (1972-1975), the New York Jets (1976), the University of Arkansas (1977-1983), the University of Minnesota (1984-1985), the University of Notre Dame (1986-1996), and the University of South Carolina (1999-2004), compiling a career record of 249-132-7. Holtz's 1988 Notre Dame team went 12-0 with a victory in the Fiesta Bowl and was the consensus national champion. Holtz is the only college football coach to lead six different programs to bowl games and the only coach to guide four different programs to the final top 20 rankings. In 1986, Holtz left Minnesota to take over the then-struggling Notre Dame Fighting Irish football program. A taskmaster and strict disciplinarian, Holtz had the names removed from the backs of the players' jerseys when he took over at Notre Dame, wanting to emphasize team effort. With the exception of select bowl games, names have not been included on Notre Dame's jerseys since. Although his 1986 squad posted an identical 5-6 mark that the 1985 edition had, five of their six losses were by a combined total of 14 points. In the season finale against the archrival USC Trojans, Notre Dame overcame a 17-point fourth-quarter deficit and pulled out a 38-37 win.  In his second season, Holtz led the Fighting Irish to an appearance in the Cotton Bowl Classic, where the Irish lost to the Texas A&M Aggies, 35-10. The following year, Notre Dame won all eleven of their regular season games and defeated the third-ranked West Virginia Mountaineers, 34-21, in the Fiesta Bowl, claiming the national championship. The 1989 squad also won their first eleven games (and in the process set a school record with a 23-game winning streak) and remained in the No. 1 spot all season until losing to Miami in the season finale. A 21-6 win over Colorado in the Orange Bowl gave the Irish a second-place ranking in the final standings, as well as back-to-back 12-win seasons for the first time in school history.  Holtz's 1993 Irish team ended the season with an 11-1 record and ranked second in the final AP poll. Although the Florida State Seminoles were defeated by the Irish in a battle of unbeatens during the regular season and both teams had only 1 loss at season's end (Notre Dame lost to seventeenth-ranked Boston College), FSU was then voted national champion in the final 1993 AP and Coaches Poll. Between 1988 and 1993, Holtz's teams posted an overall 64-9-1 record. He also took the Irish to bowl games for nine consecutive seasons, still a Notre Dame record.  Following an investigation in 1999, the NCAA placed Notre Dame on two years probation for extra benefits provided to football players between 1993 and 1999 by Kim Dunbar, a South Bend bookkeeper involved in a 1.4 million embezzlement scheme at her employer, as well as one instance of academic fraud that occurred under Holtz's successor, Bob Davie. The NCAA found that Holtz and members of his staff learned of the violations but failed to make appropriate inquiry or to take prompt action, finding Holtz's efforts \\"inadequate.\\"  On September 13, 2008 Lou Holtz was invited back to the campus where a statue of the former coach was unveiled. The ceremony took place during the weekend of the Notre Dame/Michigan game, almost twenty-two years to the day after Holtz coached his first Notre Dame team against the Wolverines. Did he make it to any bowl games while there?","output":"Yes, Lou Holtz made it to several bowl games while coaching at Notre Dame. During his tenure from 1986 to 1996, Holtz led the Fighting Irish to nine consecutive bowl games, which remains a Notre Dame record. Some of the notable bowl games that Holtz coached the Notre Dame team in include: 1. 1987 Cotton Bowl Classic - Notre Dame played against Texas A&M Aggies and lost 35-10. 2. 1989 Fiesta Bowl - Notre Dame defeated the West Virginia Mountaineers with a score of 34-21, claiming the national championship. 3. 1990 Orange Bowl - Notre Dame won against the Colorado Buffaloes with a score of 21-6, finishing the season ranked second in the final standings. 4. 1991 Orange Bowl - Notre Dame lost to the Colorado Buffaloes with a 10-9 score. 5. 1992 Sugar Bowl - Notre Dame defeated Florida Gators with a 39-28 score. 6. 1993 Cotton Bowl Classic - Notre Dame won against Texas A&M Aggies with a score of 28-3. 7. 1994 Cotton Bowl Classic - Notre Dame once again defeated Texas A&M Aggies with a score of 24-21. 8. 1995 Fiesta Bowl - Notre Dame lost to Colorado Buffaloes with a 41-24 score. 9. 1996 Orange Bowl - Notre Dame played against Florida State Seminoles and lost 31-26. These appearances in bowl games demonstrate the success of Lou Holtz's coaching at Notre Dame, including the 1988 national championship title and several top-tier finishes in final rankings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Select the topic that this about: Canada #39;s dollar gained for the fifth week in six, reaching the highest since January 1992, on speculation the central bank will lift its interest-rate target next month.","output":"Topic: Canadian Dollar and Central Bank's Interest Rate Speculations The Canadian dollar has experienced an upward trend over the past weeks, with a continuous gain for the fifth week in six. The currency reached its highest value since January 1992, driven by market speculation that the Bank of Canada – the nation's central bank – may raise its interest-rate target in the coming month. This topic covers various aspects such as the factors contributing to the appreciation of the Canadian dollar, the potential consequences of the central bank increasing its interest-rate target, and potential impacts on the Canadian economy. I. Factors contributing to the Canadian dollar appreciation Several factors have contributed to the appreciation of the Canadian dollar, including: 1. Increasing commodity prices: Canada is a major exporter of commodities such as oil, gas, and minerals. As global demand and economic recovery continue to strengthen, commodity prices have been on the rise, which bolsters the Canadian dollar. 2. Economic recovery and growth: The Canadian economy has shown signs of recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. With the vaccination rollout and easing of pandemic-related restrictions, economic growth has also been supported, contributing to the strength of the Canadian dollar. 3. Global market trends and USD weakness: The appreciation of the Canadian dollar can also be attributed to weakening of the US dollar against major currencies, as investors look for more profitable investment opportunities. The increased demand for the Canadian dollar due to global market trends has supported its appreciation. 4. Expectations of a central bank interest rate hike: Market speculation that the Bank of Canada may raise its interest-rate target in the near future has further contributed to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar. II. Consequences of central bank increasing its interest-rate target If the Bank of Canada does decide to increase its interest-rate target, several consequences may arise, including: 1. Increased borrowing costs: Higher interest rates will lead to higher borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. This could affect consumer spending, business investment, and potentially slow down economic growth. 2. Inflation management: A primary motive for central banks to raise interest rates is to manage inflation. If the Canadian economy is experiencing inflationary pressures, an increase in the interest-rate target could help to control inflation and stabilize prices. 3. Attraction of foreign investment: Higher interest rates typically make a country's financial markets more attractive to foreign investors, as they may seek better returns on their investments. This could lead to an influx of foreign capital, which would further strengthen the Canadian dollar. III. Potential impacts on the Canadian economy If the central bank does raise its interest-rate target, it could have several effects on the Canadian economy: 1. Impact on exports: A stronger Canadian dollar makes the country's exports more expensive for foreign buyers, which could lead to decreased demand for Canadian goods and services. This may negatively impact export-oriented industries in the short term. 2. Impact on imports: A stronger dollar makes imports cheaper for Canadians, which could lead to increased consumption of foreign goods and services. While this may benefit consumers, it could also lead to a higher trade deficit. 3. Impact on domestic business: Higher interest rates could slow down business investments, as companies may put off expansion plans due to increased borrowing costs. A weaker overall business environment could impact employment and overall economic growth. In conclusion, the recent appreciation of the Canadian dollar has been driven by various factors such as increasing commodity prices, economic recovery, global market trends, and speculations about the central bank raising its interest-rate target. If the central bank does decide to raise interest rates, this could have both positive and negative consequences on the Canadian economy. It is essential for policymakers to monitor and assess these impacts in order to ensure stability and sustainable growth."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an email with the following subject: Kinder/Morgan PRM Structure Email:","output":"Subject: Kinder/Morgan PRM Structure - An Overview and Proposal for Enhancement Dear [Recipient's Name], I hope this email finds you in good health and high spirits. As the leader of our team focusing on the Kinder/Morgan partnership, I would like to discuss the existing Performance and Risk Management (PRM) structure and propose a few enhancements to streamline our operations and further fortify our alliance. I request your valuable insights and inputs on the proposed changes, as your experience and expertise will be pivotal in strengthening the framework. At present, our PRM structure for the Kinder/Morgan partnership comprises the following key components: 1. Performance Management: Our current performance management process involves setting annual goals, conducting quarterly reviews, and carrying out annual appraisals for project milestones and individual achievements. 2. Risk Management: We have a detailed process of risk identification, assessment, monitoring, and mitigation, incorporating financial, operational, and compliance risks. 3. Internal Controls: Our internal controls consist of various policies, procedures, and mechanisms designed to ensure the reliability of financial reporting, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and the effectiveness of our business operations. 4. Reporting and Analytics: We have a data-driven reporting and analytics system in place, enabling real-time tracking and analysis of key performance indicators (KPIs) to help us make informed strategic decisions. While our current PRM structure has served us well thus far, there is potential for improvement. In light of the evolving business landscape and to ensure we maintain a competitive edge, I propose the following enhancements: 1. Implementing a Continuous Performance Management Process: To facilitate an environment of constant growth and development, incorporating more frequent touchpoints (such as monthly or bi-monthly check-ins) between employees and managers can provide valuable and timely feedback. This will ensure alignment with project objectives, identify areas for improvement, and foster a culture of collaboration and accountability. 2. Strengthening Risk Management Protocols: While our current risk management process is robust, establishing a dedicated Risk Management Committee can enable more rigorous monitoring, quicker response times, and better coordination. This committee can comprise key representatives from various internal departments, including finance, legal, operations, and more. 3. Enhancing Internal Controls: Periodic internal control assessments can help us identify and address gaps in our current systems and adjust our control measures accordingly. Additionally, a regular review of our policies and procedures will help ensure they remain relevant and effective, adapting to the changing business landscape. 4. Leveraging Advanced Reporting and Analytics Tools: Investing in advanced data analytics and visualization tools can help us gain deeper insights into our performance trends and empower us to make data-driven strategic decisions more efficiently. 5. Fostering an Open Feedback Culture: Encourage open communication between team members across all levels and introduce feedback mechanisms, such as anonymous surveys or suggestion boxes, to promote a culture of continuous improvement. I believe that these suggested enhancements will contribute significantly to solidifying our PRM structure, bolstering the performance of our partnership with Kinder/Morgan, and fostering mutual success. I would appreciate your thoughts on these proposed changes and seek your guidance on the next steps for implementation. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to discussing this further with you and collaborating on the path to an even stronger partnership.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the man that the person who fall for gardener serves?  The backstory takes place in 12th century England, where Lord Thibault Malféte is about to marry Princess Rosalind, the daughter of the reigning King. At the wedding banquet, by mistake, an enemy known as the Earl of Warwick gives Thibault a potion which makes him hallucinate (and which was actually intended for Rosalind by a witch hired and paid by the Earl), and under its influence, he kills his own bride (rather than her father, as in the French version) believing she is a ferocious monster. While under sentence of death, he asks his servant, André Le Paté to find a wizard to help him. The wizard gives him a potion that will send him back to the moment before he killed Princess Rosalind. The incompetent wizard botches the spell, and instead, Thibault and Andre are sent into the 21st century. They end up in a museum in Chicago where they are arrested by the police. They are rescued by Julia Malféte, a museum employee who closely resembles Princess Rosalind. She thinks that Thibault is her distant French cousin who drowned while yachting a couple of years ago. Thibault soon finds out that Julia is descended from his family and realizes he must return to the 12th century to correct the past. Julia introduces them to the modern American style of life where norms from medieval times no longer apply. Before the return to his time, Thibault decides to protect Julia from her money-hungry fiance, Hunter. Meanwhile, Andre falls for a pretty gardener, Angelique who presents him with the world of equal rights for all people. The answer is:","output":"Step 1: Identify the relevant information to answer the question: \\"What is the first name of the man that the person who falls for the gardener serves?\\" Relevant information: \\"Meanwhile, Andre falls for a pretty gardener, Angelique\\" and \\"he asks his servant, André Le Paté to find a wizard to help him.\\" Step 2: Determine the person who falls for the gardener.

Johan August Strindberg (; Swedish: [2strInd,baerj] ( listen); 22 January 1849 - 14 May 1912) was a Swedish playwright, novelist, poet, essayist and painter. A prolific writer who often drew directly on his personal experience, Strindberg's career spanned four decades, during which time he wrote over sixty plays and more than thirty works of fiction, autobiography, history, cultural analysis, and politics. Influenced by the history of the Paris Commune, during 1871, young Strindberg embraced the view, that politics is a conflict between the upper and lower classes. He was admired by many as a far-left writer. He was a socialist (or perhaps more of an anarchist, meaning a libertarian socialist, which he himself claimed on at least one occasion). Strindberg's political opinions nevertheless changed considerably within this category over the years, and he was never primarily a political writer. Nor did he often campaign for any one issue, preferring instead to scorn his enemies manifesto-style - the military, the church, the monarchy, the politicians, the stingy publishers, the incompetent reviewers, the narrow-minded, the idiots - and he was not loyal to any party or ideology. Many of his works, however, had at least some politics and sometimes an abundance of it. They often displayed that life and the prevailing system were profoundly unjust and injurious to ordinary citizens.  The changing nature of his political positions shows in his changing stance on the women's rights issue. Early on, Strindberg was sympathetic to women of 19th-century Sweden, calling for women's suffrage as early as 1884. However, during other periods he had strongly misogynistic opinions, calling for lawmakers to reconsider the emancipation of these \\"half-apes ... mad ... criminal, instinctively evil animals.\\" This is controversial in contemporary assessments of Strindberg, as have his antisemitic descriptions of Jews (and, in particular, Jewish enemies of his in Swedish cultural life) in some works (e.g., Det nya riket), particularly during the early 1880s. Strindberg's antisemitic pronouncements, just like his opinions of women, have been debated, and also seem to have varied considerably. Many of these attitudes, passions and behaviours may have been developed for literary reasons and ended as soon as he had exploited them in books.  In satirizing Swedish society - in particular the upper classes, the cultural and political establishment, and his many personal and professional foes - he could be very confrontational, with scarcely concealed caricatures of political opponents. This could take the form of brutal character disparagement or mockery, and while the presentation was generally skilful, it was not necessarily subtle.  His daughter Karin Strindberg married a Russian Bolshevik of partially Swedish ancestry, Vladimir Smirnov (\\"Paulsson\\"). Because of his political views, Strindberg was promoted strongly in socialist countries in Central and Eastern Europe, as well as in the Soviet Union and Cuba.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did he talk about his political views?","output":"Yes, Johan August Strindberg did talk about his political views. As mentioned in the provided text, he was influenced by the history of the Paris Commune, and young Strindberg embraced the view that politics is a conflict between the upper and lower classes.

Make sure you can hear other people spinning and winning though, because one time I played when people weren't  and lost some money.  Roulette tables change their minimum at night. The cheapest table is 10 and it goes up to 15. It's not a big bump, but it's big enough to keep me from playing more than a couple of spins. I don't know if it's a Vegas norm or a Wynn norm.

And if you're an even bigger gambler and earn 500 points, you can get 2 more free buffets. Buffets can be used during a future visit.   If you're with another person you can just use the same card to accumulate points faster. If you both live at the same address and can prove it (via driver's licence, etc.) you have the option of linking your cards so you can each sign up and each get the 10 free slot play, and as I understand it (double-check to be sure), your combined points can work towards the buffets.

(April 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Sick Girl is the story of Izzy Shea (Leslie Andrews), a girl who wants to protect her younger brother, have sex with her older brother and torture everyone else out in the barn. Izzy is raising her younger brother, Kevin, by herself. Their parents are deceased and her older brother, Rusty, is away in the Marines. When Izzy learns that her little brother is being bullied at school, she does what any unstable, psychopathic, homicidal sister would do.[3] The movie starts out with Izzy waiting for the school bus. In the back are two popular girls who make several snide remarks about her. One of the girl's boyfriend is following the bus route in his car with his friend. The girls drop a pair of panties out the window, and if her boyfriend finds them, he'll be rewarded. After Izzy attacks one of the nuns on the bus for seemingly no reason, she's kicked off and begins to walk back along the road. She runs into the two boys, and lures the friend out of the car. She kills him, and the other boy quickly discovers the scene. Izzy chases him across a field and tackles him. The scene ends, and now we see Izzy cleaning herself up in a bathroom. She is covered in blood and is completely unfazed by this. Clips are shown of Izzy finding a gun in the boys' car, and her holding the school bus hostage, seemingly killing everyone. She chases the two popular girls off the bus, and with the gun and a can of gasoline, she quickly catches one of the girls. The other watches in horror as Izzy kills her friend. Izzy returns home, and we see a flashback sequence of Rusty training Izzy how to fight in their garage. The two share a moment of sibling fondness, but it is cut short by the arrival of Rusty's girlfriend. The flashback sequence ends, and Izzy finds their family friend, Barnie, teaching Kevin how to throw a punch....

Voltage peak.","output":"The word \\"peak\\" in both sentences conveys the general idea of reaching the highest point or the maximum value; however, its meaning is specific to the context and subject matter in which it is used. Let's look at each sentence in detail to understand the differences in their respective meanings. 1. \\"The stock market reached a peak in September 1929.\\" In this sentence, \\"peak\\" refers to the highest point or the pinnacle of the stock market. When discussing financial markets such as the stock market, the word \\"peak\\" is used to describe a point where the market reaches its highest value before starting to decline. In this context, \\"peak\\" implies that the market was at its greatest height in terms of value, investor confidence, and overall performance, possibly representing the zenith of an economic boom period. A peak in the stock market often relates to stock prices, market capitalization, trading volume, and other financial parameters that indicate the market's health. 2. \\"Voltage peak.\\" The term \\"voltage peak\\" is a technical term used in the context of electrical and electronic systems. In this context, \\"peak\\" relates to the maximum value or amplitude of an electrical waveform (a signal representing voltage over time). Voltage is a measure of the electric potential difference between two points, and it fluctuates over time in alternating current (AC) systems and some electronic circuits. A \\"voltage peak\\" is reached when the voltage reaches its maximum positive or negative value during a waveform cycle. This value is important in various applications, such as power transmission, signal processing, and analyzing the performance of electronic devices. In summary, \\"peak\\" represents the highest point or maximum value in each respective context. In the first sentence, it refers to the highest point of the stock market, capturing the idea of optimal financial performance. In the second sentence, it refers to the maximum value of voltage within an electrical waveform, which is significant for understanding and working with electrical and electronic systems. While the general essence of \\"peak\\" is shared between these two instances, the meaning differs based on the specific context in which it is applied."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Martin's first recording session with the Beatles took place at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London on 6 June 1962. Martin immediately complained to Epstein about Best's poor drumming and suggested they use a session drummer in his place. Already contemplating Best's dismissal, the Beatles replaced him in mid-August with Ringo Starr, who left Rory Storm and the Hurricanes to join them. A 4 September session at EMI yielded a recording of \\"Love Me Do\\" featuring Starr on drums, but a dissatisfied Martin hired drummer Andy White for the band's third session a week later, which produced recordings of \\"Love Me Do\\", \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"P.S.

Their television debut came later that month with a live performance on the regional news programme People and Places.

He wore uniform number 26. Step 2: Identify the conclusion The conclusion we are trying to evaluate is whether Mark Baltz belongs to the National Football League.

Step 4: Determine if the conclusion is supported by the premise The premise states that Mark Baltz was an official in the NFL from 1989 through 2013. He worked as a head linesman throughout his career in the NFL, which demonstrates that he did indeed have a role within the National Football League. However, the premise also states that Mark Baltz was an official \\"from 1989 through 2013.\\" This indicates that his affiliation with the NFL may have ended in 2013, and he may no longer be associated with the league.

While it is true that the estimated population of Clark County in 2015 was higher than in the 2010 census, we cannot draw the conclusion that the sole cause of this increase was immigration. Population growth occurs due to various factors, including birth rates, death rates, immigration, and emigration. It is likely that the increase in population was caused by a combination of factors rather than just immigration. For instance, an area with a growing economy, a low cost of living, and high quality of life may attract people from other parts of the country and even the world. In the case of Clark County, the thriving tourism and entertainment industry in Las Vegas may contribute to the higher population estimates in 2015 compared to 2010. These factors may lead to an increase in the number of people migrating to the region. Additionally, a higher birth rate among existing residents can contribute to population growth in a region. If there were more births than deaths in Clark County between 2010 and 2015, it may lead to an increase in population. However, it is essential to consider that this growth could also be offset by any residents who decided to move out of the county or by a higher-than-average death rate. Overall, while immigration may be one of the factors contributing to the higher population estimate in 2015 compared to 2010, it's impossible to say that it was the sole cause of the increase without analyzing other contributing factors. Further demographic analysis would need to be conducted to isolate and quantify the specific causes of population growth in Clark County."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: A scientist studied the effects of alcoholic beverages on the human body during severe weather exposure. He decided to experiment on himself. He stood in -30 degrees weather for 2 hours and called it experiment A. He then repeated the experiment, the only difference being that he consumed a pint of hard liquor before and during those two hours, and that was called experiment B.  and a hint : Alcoholic beverages do not make the entire body warmer.[361] The reason that alcoholic drinks create the sensation of warmth is that they cause blood vessels to dilate and stimulate nerve endings near the surface of the skin with an influx of warm blood. This can actually result in making the core body temperature lower, as it allows for easier heat exchange with a cold external environment.  Please answer this question : When did the scientist's blood vessels dilate less, during experiment A, or during B? Answer:","output":"The scientist's blood vessels dilated less during experiment A. In this experiment, he did not consume any alcoholic beverages, so his blood vessels were not affected by the alcohol.

Plumerias require temperatures of at least 65 to 80 degrees fahrenheit (about 18 to 27 degrees celsius). They will not survive in temperatures below 55 degrees fahrenheit (about 13 degrees celsius).","output":"After choosing a warm location for your plumeria plant, the next steps involve planting, caring for, and maintaining your plumeria to ensure healthy growth and beautiful blooms.  1. Obtain a plumeria cutting or plant: Plumerias can be propagated from cuttings or purchased as small plants from a nursery. Mature plumeria plants can grow quite large, so if you're starting with a cutting, choose one that's at least 12-18 inches long and has healthy leaves. If purchasing a small plant, make sure it appears healthy and is free of any pests or diseases. 2. Prepare your planting site: Choose a spot in your garden that receives at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day. Plumerias thrive in well-draining soil, so consider amending your soil with perlite or coarse sand if necessary. This will help prevent root rot and encourage healthy growth. 3. Plant your plumeria: If starting from a cutting, remove the bottom leaves and let the cutting dry for a few days before planting. This helps to seal the cut end and reduces the chance of rotting. When ready to plant, place the cutting in a pre-dug hole, leaving about one-third of the cutting exposed above ground. Fill the hole with soil, making sure it's well-packed to provide stability. If planting a small plumeria plant from a pot, gently remove it from the container and place it in a hole that's about twice the size of the root ball. Fill in the hole with soil, making sure to maintain the same level of soil around the stem as in the pot. 4. Watering: Plumeria plants do not require constant watering. Water your plumeria deeply upon planting, and then allow the soil to dry out between waterings. This is crucial to prevent root rot and support healthy growth. During the growing season, water your plumeria every 7-10 days, less frequently if there's ample rainfall. 5. Fertilizing: To encourage growth and flowering, fertilize your plumeria every 4-6 weeks during the growing season, typically from early spring to early fall. Use a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or a specially formulated plumeria fertilizer according to package instructions. Avoid over-fertilizing, as this may contribute to excess foliage growth at the expense of flower production. 6. Pruning: Plumerias don't require extensive pruning, but it's essential to maintain their shape and encourage branching. Prune your plumeria in late winter or early spring before new growth begins. Remove any dead or damaged branches, and cut back any spindly or overcrowded growth to promote better airflow and light penetration. When pruning, make clean cuts at a 45-degree angle, just above a leaf node or stem junction. 7. Pest and disease control: Monitor your plumeria regularly for signs of pests or diseases. Common pests include spider mites, mealybugs, and whiteflies, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap or neem oil. Plumerias may also be susceptible to fungal infections, particularly in areas with high humidity. Ensure proper air circulation and avoid overhead watering to reduce the risk of infection. Apply a fungicide if necessary. 8. Winter care: If you live in an area where temperatures drop below 55 degrees fahrenheit (about 13 degrees celsius), you'll have to protect your plumeria in winter. For potted plants, simply bring them indoors and place them in a sunny spot. For in-ground plants, consider constructing a temporary greenhouse or using frost protection cloths to cover your plumeria when temperatures drop. Remember to reduce watering during the winter months, as plumerias enter dormancy and require less water. By following these steps, you'll be well on your way to enjoying a thriving plumeria plant with gorgeous, fragrant blooms. With proper care and attention, your plumeria will reward you with an abundance of colorful flowers for years to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Delta State University shooting: The Ethan Schmidt I knew Ethan Schmidt was an Assistant Professor of American History at Delta State University in Mississippi. (Delta State University) I used to joke about the rally chant of the Delta State Statesmen. “We are Delta State,” the fans scream from the basketball stadium. “We are family!” How could that phrase possibly intimidate an opposing team? Now, sitting at a campus on lockdown, I know the strength in those words. Police Monday afternoon confirmed the death of my colleague Ethan Schmidt. We did not share the same areas of study. He was a history professor and I work with the journalism department. What I know about Schmidt, a Kansas native in his mid-fifties, I know from the vantage of a basketball court. He used to show up to faculty pickup games dressed a University of Kansas t-shirt; Schmidt graduated from the University of Kansas with a PhD in philosophy in 2007. He'd have his son in tow and the talent in the family clearly rested in the younger generation, a fact in which the elder Schmidt was proud. Schmidt, who directed the first-year seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history, had a reputation for being a good guy and a family man. Our colleague, Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school, told the AP that he was \\"a gentleman in every sense of the word.\\" Despite being in a small town, I don't know the person of interest police have identified, Delta State Geography professor Shannon Lamb. Our paths never crossed. But in a place where the local sports section of the paper is second in size only to wedding announcements, Schmidt's love for basketball was infectious and impacted us all. There’s only so much you can learn about a person through a sport, but as helicopters circle over the gymnasium where he used to laugh his way through games of three on three, there is a sense that today we are all on the same team. At Delta State, we are family. Adrienne Berard is the Writer in Residence at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi.

How do oscillations at low frequency limits power transfer over transmission lines? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"Yes, those two questions are paraphrases of each other. They both ask about how low frequency oscillations can affect power transfer in transmission lines. Now, imagine we have a long string, like a jump rope tied between two trees. When we shake one end of the string slowly, large waves will travel from one end to the other. The slow, big waves are like low frequency oscillations in a transmission line. Transmission lines carry electricity from power plants to our homes. But when the oscillations or waves on these lines are at low frequencies, it can cause some issues with power transfer. Just like how the big waves on our string moves back and forth slowly, low frequency oscillations take a longer time to travel over the transmission line. When the power transfer is slow, it's harder for electricity to reach our homes quickly and efficiently. This means that the maximum amount of power the transmission line can deliver safely might be reduced. It's like when we don't get the jump rope to swing as fast as we want because we're moving it too slowly.

This movie will also tell you why Indian movie-goers are astute buyers. Amitabh was at the peak of his domination of Bollywood when his one-time godfather Prakash Mehra decided to use his image yet again. Prakash has the habit of picking themes and building stories out of it, adding liberal doses of Bollywood sensibilities and clichés to it. Zanzeer saw the making of Angry Young Man. Lawaris was about being a bastard and Namak Halal was about the master-servant loyalties.  But then, the theme was limited to move the screenplay through the regulation three hours of song, dance and drama. What comprised of the movie is a caricature of a Haryanavi who goes to Mumbai and turns into a regulation hero. Amitabh's vocal skills and diction saw this movie earn its big bucks, thanks to his flawless stock Haryanvi accent. To me, this alone is the biggest pull in the movie. The rest all is typical Bollywood screen writing. Amitabh, by now, had to have some typical comedy scenes in each of his movies. Thanks to Manmohan Desai. This movie had a good dose of them. The shoe caper in the party, the monologue over Vijay Merchant and Vijay Hazare's considerations, The mosquito challenge in the boardroom and the usual drunkard scene that by now has become a standard Amitabh fare. Shashi Kapoor added an extra mile to the movie with his moody, finicky character (Remember him asking Ranjeet to \\"Shaaadaaaap\\" after the poisoned cake incident\\"). His was the all important role of the master while Amitabh was his loyal servant. But Prakash Mehra knew the Indian mind...and so Shashi had to carry along his act with the rest of the movie. It was one character that could have been more developed to make a serious movie. But this is a caper, remember? And as long as it stayed that way, the people came and saw Amitabh wearing a new hat and went back home happy. The end is always predictable, and the good guys get the gal and the bad ones go to the gaol, the age-old theme of loyalty is once again emphasized and all is well that ends well. So what is it that makes this movie a near classic? Amitabh Bacchan as the Haryanvi. Prakash Mehra created yet another icon in the name of a story. Chuck the story, the characters and the plot.

Put your name, phone number, and a photo of your cat on the flier. Describe any distinguishing marks (such as, \\"triangular white spot on shoulder\\"), and write the coat color if you're distributing black-and-white flyers. Search for online templates for \\"Lost Cat posters\\" if you're not sure how to make one from scratch.  Include relevant information about specific dietary or medical conditions if life threatening. Ask neighbors to kindly check their sheds, garages and basements. Closest neighbors that the cat is reasonably familiar with are good places to check with first. Offering a reward can be good motivation and can get people out looking instead of \\"keeping an eye out.\\" If you receive a report of a cat sighting that doesn't quite match your cat's description, visit the location anyway to make sure. Descriptions from strangers often don't match the description you would give the cat. Keep info on posters large, easy to read and simple. Include the relevant facts only. As well, ensure that the associated contact details are up-to-date, so a vet or animal agency can call you. Implanting a microchip is a very common procedure and only needs to be done once in a pet's life. Microchips are implanted by a veterinary professional under the skin over the shoulder blades of the cat. The microchip is about the size of a grain of rice and carries a unique code that can be read by a scanner when the hand held scanning device is waved over the pet's body.  When the chip is implanted in the pet, the owner provides registration information to the microchip company that will be kept on file until the owner changes that information. The code will be linked to the owner's information through the microchip's database. When the scanner reveals the code, the microchip company can then be contacted with the code and the owner's information will be available. Most veterinarians and animal shelters will check for a microchip for no charge when a stray cat is brought in. It's best to post as many fliers as you can within a one mile radius of your home. Beyond that, there are several strategies for using your fliers effectively, and places that may be worth walking a longer distance to cover:  Give fliers to veterinary offices, in case someone takes your cat there to treat injuries or begin an adoption process. Post flyers near schools and playgrounds, at children's eye level. Children are often more observant than adults, especially at noticing animals. Dog runs, dog parks, pet supply stores, and pet grooming salons are all visited by pet-friendly people who are more likely to search actively. Post on community message boards at laundromats, churches, missing pet websites, schools, pet stores, libraries, and grocery stores, or any other businesses that allows it in your neighborhood. Many people who come across missing pets search for owners online. Think about posting a picture of your pet or searching for it on one of numerous pet recovery websites, local community sites, the local Craigslist lost pet section, and anywhere else you can think of. Include up to date contact information on all posts.  Lost pet tracking websites include Missing Pet, Pets911, and TabbyTracker. FindToto for US residents costs money to use, but will broadcast a \\"Pet Amber Alert\\" to neighbors in your area. Twitter and Facebook can be used to spread the word among your network of friends. Be sure to include a photo or two. If your neighborhood association has an email news digest or web site, post a Lost Cat notice. Remember to include the cat's name, description and temperament. Pay a local newspaper to place a lost cat ad, including a description and your phone number. The more local to the area the newspaper is, the better. If no local newspaper serves your area, ask about community newsletters at a community center, a police or sheriff's station, or a local government building. Record a new voice mail message to make sure callers leave all relevant information. For example, say \\"You've reached (name). If you're calling about my lost cat, (name), please leave a message with the date and place you last saw him, along with your name and phone number. Thank you.\\" Usually if someone comes across a lost cat, they'll report it to the SPCA, Animal Control or your local equivalent. Call your local animal shelter and report your cat has gone missing along with all the relevant details (sex of the cat, color, and your contact information). Visit them every day or two until your cat is found, as sometimes shelters have many cats and have a difficult time matching your description to what they have. Some shelters keep a log of lost pet announcements so that they have records of your information should a similar animal come into their facility. It never hurts to make friends with the front staff at the shelter to make them personally aware of your situation and your pet's description. Home baked goods break a lot of ice anywhere you ask for help. Check in person every couple of days. If your cat has been taken to a crowded shelter or local pound, they may only be able to hold cats for a few days before euthanizing the cat. If the staff know you're actively looking, they can be a great ally. Ask them to call you if a cat fitting your cat's description turns up. Sometimes, police get calls about found animals, especially in areas without shelters. Officers who spend their day driving around might notice your cat. Do not call the emergency number for your police department! Call the non-emergency 311 number or just talk to your local patrolman instead. While your lost cat is an emergency to you, police need to prioritize incidents involving people. Check local newspapers and popular online sites daily under the \\"found\\" section. Many animal shelters have websites that show pictures of captured, stray animals, so check the website daily or more frequently. Search for \\"lost pets\\" + the name of your region to discover additional local websites. ” Pet detectives are available in most states trained in finding lost pets.","output":"When a cat goes missing for more than a few hours, it is essential to take immediate action to increase the chances of finding the pet.

After completing his training he is tasked by Sargon to kill Noah, Mathayus's own brother. He saves him and escapes the city, but a magic arrow follows them and kills Noah. Mathayus boards a ship to Egypt, accompanied by his childhood friend Layla. He intends to get the Spear of Osiris in Egypt, which he believes will be able to pass through Sargon's black magic protection. A fellow traveller, Greek poet Aristophanes (Ari), tells Mathayus and Layla that the Spear only kills Egyptian creatures, but the Sword of Damocles will work. The trio travels to Greece, where they can enter the Underworld to retrieve the Sword of Damocles. On the way, they fall into a cell and are surrounded by men left as sacrifices for the Minotaur. Some of the sacrifices are mercenaries who owe allegiance to Mathayus' father, so they help him and Layla to defeat the Minotaur, with help from a Chinese captive named Fung. The enlarged group travel to the Underworld, where they are attacked by the goddess Astarte. Layla and Astarte fight, while Fung and Ari search for and find the sword.

These modern French designs, incorporating features then unknown in Scotland, such as the double-pile of major rooms in two enfilades, ranged back-to-back, were also influential on Bruce's designs.English influence is also visible in his work. His country houses took the compact Anglo-Dutch type as their model, as introduced into England by Hugh May and Sir Roger Pratt, but with Continental detailing, such as the rustication on the facade at Mertoun. Roger Pratt's Coleshill House of 1660 is often cited as a model for Bruce's Kinross House. Konrad Ottenheym concludes that Bruce employed an \\"international style\\", which was fashionable in France, Holland, and England, and that he was pivotal in disseminating this style in Scotland.  answer the following question:  What is the last name of the person who, in 1663, made a further \\"foreign journey\\" at the behest of Lauderdale was pivotal in disseminating this style in Scotland? A:","output":"The last name of the person who, in 1663, made a further \\"foreign journey\\" at the behest of Lauderdale and was pivotal in disseminating the international style in Scotland is Bruce. The individual in question is William Bruce."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: How to Prepare for a Wedding","output":"When preparing for a wedding, it is essential to carefully consider and evaluate the options, resources, and personal preferences to determine the best course of action. I will outline two possible solutions, and from there, you can determine which approach suits your needs. Solution 1: Hiring a Professional Wedding Planner A professional wedding planner can offer a comprehensive range of services to oversee and manage every aspect of your special day. The benefits of hiring a wedding planner include: 1. Experience: Planners have extensive experience and expertise in organizing weddings of various sizes and styles, ensuring a well-organized and enjoyable event. 2. Time-saving: Planning a wedding can be time-consuming. Wedding planners will manage timelines, coordinate with vendors, and handle all the details, freeing up time for the couple to relax and enjoy their engagement period. 3. Vendor relationships: Wedding planners have established relationships with reputable vendors, allowing them to negotiate better deals and ensuring a high standard of service. 4. Budget management: A planner can help you create and maintain a budget. They also have effective cost-saving strategies while maintaining the desired vision. 5. Creative input: Wedding planners can provide ideas and suggestions to enhance the overall theme and décor. 6. Stress reduction: A wedding planner takes on the responsibility of managing logistics and troubleshooting any unforeseen issues, allowing the couple to focus on enjoying their special day. Solution 2: DIY (Do-It-Yourself) Wedding Planning A DIY approach to wedding planning can be a more cost-effective and personalized experience, incorporating your unique vision and preferences. Some benefits of DIY wedding planning include: 1. Budget control: Planning your wedding without professional assistance may provide more control over the budget, as you can directly negotiate with vendors, eliminate unnecessary expenses, and explore DIY options for decorations, invitations, and other wedding elements. 2. Customization: A DIY wedding grants you the freedom to make personal choices, down to the smallest details, resulting in a truly unique event tailored to your specific tastes. 3. Hands-on experience: Many couples find satisfaction in being involved in every aspect of their wedding, from designing invitations to selecting vendors, ultimately resulting in a deeper sense of personal investment in the event. 4. Learning experience: The process of planning a DIY wedding can be a learning experience, as you will need to research and select vendors, create timelines, and manage your budget. 5. Bonding with friends and family: Collaborating with friends and family can strengthen relationships and create lasting memories while working together towards a shared goal. In conclusion, both approaches have their merits. Hiring a professional wedding planner offers a more streamlined and stress-free experience, with the assurance of expertise and valuable vendor relationships. On the other hand, the DIY wedding planning solution allows for greater budget control, customization, and personal involvement in the process. Your choice should depend on your priorities, available time, and level of interest in managing the planning process. If you desire a stress-free, professionally managed event with minimal personal involvement, hiring a wedding planner might be the best choice for you. On the other hand, if you are excited about the idea of taking charge of every aspect and are willing to dedicate time to the planning process, a DIY approach could be the more appropriate option."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A sperm meets an egg in the uterus of a woman. If there are fewer sperm present in the uterus, the probability of a sperm successfully meeting and fertilizing an egg decreases. 2. The sperm implants itself into the egg. With fewer sperm present, the chance of successful implantation and fertilization decreases. 3. The sperm and egg form a zygote on the wall of the uterus. If fewer eggs are successfully fertilized, there will be fewer zygotes. 4. The fetus grows and develops. With fewer zygotes, there will be fewer fetuses. 5. The woman gives birth to a baby. Since there were fewer fetuses, the woman will give birth to fewer babies. 6. The baby is raised by parents until it is able to take care of itself. Fewer babies will be raised by parents due to the reduced number of successful fertilizations. 7. The person goes out into the world and finds a job. With fewer babies being born, there are fewer individuals entering the workforce. 8. The person meets other people and has a life. The smaller population due to fewer babies being born will result in fewer interactions for individuals. 9. The person gets a career and gets married. Fewer people will get careers and marry because there are fewer individuals in the population. 10. The person retires and eventually passes away. This part of the process is not affected by the number of sperm in the uterus. Overall, fewer sperm in the uterus will result in less babies being conceived and born, affecting the population size."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

(AP) -- A group of black parents and civil rights activists presented a petition  Thursday calling for officials to drop charges against a 16-year-old South Carolina high school student who was videotaped being dragged from her desk and thrown to the floor by a police officer in her classroom. The group said it was unfair and unacceptable that the student and her 18-year-old classmate at Spring Valley High School who taped the incident were the only people charged that day when authorities already knew Richland County Deputy Ben Fields had tossed the girl from her desk to the ground. They also said their petition had hundreds of thousands of names from around the country asking prosecutor Dan Johnson to drop the \\"disturbing schools\\" charges against the teens. The students in the case are black; Fields is white. Johnson issued a statement Wednesday saying he won't do anything with the case until the FBI finishes its investigation into Fields, who was fired after the video became public. \\"I do not simply decide cases based upon feelings, public opinion or sentiment, nor do I decide them based on political pressure,\\" Johnson said in the statement. Disturbing schools is punishable by a fine of up to 1,000 or 90 days in jail. The students' lawyer did not respond to telephone messages. The video spread quickly across the country, prompting questions about when police officers should get involved with classroom discipline. Fields was called to the classroom after the student refused to stop using her cellphone, and then she would not leave the classroom for a teacher or administrator. In the days after the incident, the teacher turned her class over to a substitute and the administrator was placed on leave. Richland two officials didn't respond to an email asking about their current status. The students were allowed back in school. Organizers of the protest said they plan to be at South Carolina's Statehouse next year, calling for legislators to change the law that allows police officers to arrest...

Season the patty with salt and pepper.","output":"Title: A Simple Guide to Perfectly Seasoned and Flattened Hamburger Patties Introduction: The hamburger is a classic comfort food enjoyed by people all across the globe. One of the most crucial elements in creating a delicious hamburger is forming the perfect patty. In this article, we'll discuss an easy-to-follow method for flattening and seasoning your hamburger meat with salt and pepper, helping you achieve a juicy, flavorful patty for your next cookout or family meal. Step 1: Selecting the Right Meat Before you even think about seasoning or flattening, it's vital to choose the best ground meat for your burgers. Opt for ground beef with an 80/20 lean-to-fat ratio for a juicier patty with a rich flavor. This balance of lean meat and fat content ensures that your burgers maintain both their moisture and taste once cooked. Step 2: Forming the Patty Overworking the meat can change its texture, so be gentle when handling it. With clean hands, scoop out the desired amount of meat and shape it into a rough ball. You can use a food scale to ensure consistent sizing, but this is not necessary. A round shape is easier to work with and provides an even surface for seasoning and flattening. Step 3: Flattening the Hamburger Meat Once you have your ball of meat, place it between two sheets of wax or parchment paper for a cleaner and less sticky process. Use a smooth, heavy object like a rolling pin or the bottom of a skillet to press down on the meat, evenly flattening it into a patty about ¾-inch thick. Another method is using a burger press, which evenly flattens the meat and makes uniformly shaped patties. Depending on your preference, adjust the thickness of your patty. For instance, thinner patties cook faster and are best for well-done burgers, while thicker patties will give you a juicier, medium-rare to medium burger. Step 4: Thumb Indentation After flattening your patty, create a shallow thumbprint indentation in the center. This simple yet essential step prevents the patty from puffing up and curling while cooking. Indenting the center allows the patty to cook evenly, which is crucial for achieving a flat, juicy, and tender burger. Step 5: Seasoning the Patty Now that your patties are formed, it's time to season them with the two essential ingredients: salt and pepper. Freshly ground black pepper provides a robust, earthy flavor, while coarse kosher salt or sea salt brings out the natural flavors of the meat. Be generous with your seasoning – evenly coat both sides of each patty, patting the salt and pepper into the meat to ensure it sticks during the cooking process. Step 6: Cooking Your Perfectly Seasoned and Flattened Patties Whether you're grilling outdoors or cooking on the stovetop, preheat your cooking surface to medium-high heat. For optimal flavor and texture, cook the patties for about 3 to 5 minutes per side, depending on your desired level of doneness. Avoid pressing down on the patties while they cook, as this can cause them to dry out. Step 7: Assembling and Enjoying Your Burger After cooking your patties, it's time to build your burgers. Use your favorite type of bun, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, cheese, sauces, and any other creative toppings of your choosing. Sit back and savor every bite of your perfectly seasoned, flattened, and juicy hamburger. Conclusion: By following this step-by-step guide, you're well on your way to mastering the art of creating mouthwatering, evenly seasoned, and flattened hamburger patties. Practice makes perfect, so don't be afraid to experiment with different seasonings, toppings, and cooking methods to find your ideal burger combination.

The answer is:","output":"No. A more detailed answer would be: Drilling depths for underwater drilling depend on several factors such as the drilling technology, water depth, and the geology of the ocean floor. Generally, offshore drilling can reach depths of up to 3,000 meters below the seabed, while the water depth can vary from shallow waters (less than 500 meters) to deep waters (over 1,500 meters) and ultra-deep waters (beyond 3,000 meters). Drilling from a fixed-position installation, such as a floating spar (platform) or tension-leg platform, refers to the method used to establish a stable drilling operation in the ocean. These platforms minimize the movement of the drilling structure, allowing for consistent and accurate drilling operations. However, this statement does not directly address how deep underwater drilling can be conducted. Various technologies have been developed to improve deepwater drilling capabilities, including advancements in subsea well systems, dynamic positioning technology, and drilling vessels designed for deepwater environments.

There are currently three Eastern Patriarchs who are cardinal bishops: If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Patriarch cardinals are not given what title?","output":"Patriarch cardinals are not given the title of a suburbicarian see. A suburbicarian see is one of the seven dioceses surrounding Rome that are assigned to cardinal bishops. This is because patriarch cardinals, who are leaders of the Eastern Catholic Churches, already hold a significant position within their own Church and, as such, do not require an additional title.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who was a border at a school near Runcorn in 1820? is inside the article: Edmund Sharpe was born on 31 October 1809 at Brook Cottage, Brook Street in Knutsford, Cheshire, the first child of Francis and Martha Sharpe.  His father, a peripatetic music teacher and organist at Knutsford parish church, came from Stamford in Lincolnshire.  At the time of marriage his wife, Martha Whittaker, was on the staff of an academy for young ladies, Belvedere House, in Bath, Somerset. During his childhood in Knutsford, the young Edmund played with Elizabeth Stevenson, the future Mrs Gaskell. In 1812 the Sharpe family moved across town from Over Knutsford to a farm in Nether Knutsford called Heathside, when Francis Sharpe then worked as both farmer and music teacher.  Edmund was initially educated by his parents, but by 1818 he was attending a school in Knutsford.  Two years later he was a boarder at a school near Runcorn, and in 1821 at Burney's Academy in Greenwich. Edmund's father died suddenly in November 1823, aged 48, and his mother moved to Lancaster with her family, where she later resumed her teaching career.Edmund continued his education at Burney's Academy, and became head boy. In August 1827 he moved to Sedbergh School (then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, now in Cumbria), where he remained for two years. In November 1829 he entered St John's College, Cambridge as a Lupton scholar. At the end of his course in 1832 he was awarded a Worts Travelling Bachelorship by the University of Cambridge, which enabled him to travel abroad for three years' study.  At this time his friend from Lancaster at Trinity College, William Whewell, was Professor of Mineralogy. John Hughes, Edmund Sharpe's biographer, is of the opinion that Whewell was influential in gaining this award for Sharpe. Edmund graduated BA in 1833, and was admitted to the degree of MA in 1836. During his time abroad he travelled in Germany and southern France, studying Romanesque and early Gothic architecture. He had intended to travel further into northern France, but his tour was curtailed in Paris owing to \\"fatigue and illness\\"...., can you guess it ?

Expansion quickly peaked however, and the European powers who had carved up the New World set about testing each other in dynastic conflicts and colonial rivalry. The English were the main rivals of the Dutch on the high seas, and there were several wars between the two in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1665–1667 the Dutch sailed up the River Medway and sank the British fleet moored there. The 18th century saw Amsterdam grow into the foremost financial center in the world, but the seeds of decline had already been planted. When the English colonies in New England rose up in revolt against the British, they found ready Ailies in the Dutch. From their colonies in the Caribbean they sent caches of arms and ammunition. The British were furious and went to war in 1780, destroying the Dutch navy and signaling a sudden decline in power and influence from which the Netherlands never recovered. Trade suffered to such an extent that in 1791 the VOC went into liquidation. In the latter part of the century there were anti-Orange demonstrations by pro-French factions in the country, and in 1795 Napoleon Bonaparte took the Netherlands in his epic march across Europe. Under the yoke of another foreign power, and with trade at an all time low, the Golden Age was truly dead. The Return of the House of Orange Napoleon installed his brother Louis as King of Holland and he chose to take the fine Town Hall on Dam Square as his palace — now the Koninklijk Palace. But only four years later he fled the city after civil disturbances broke out when he raised taxes. When Napoleon's bubble burst and French power began to wane, William of Orange emerged from exile and was proclaimed king in 1813. Amsterdam had to work its way out of economic decline, but throughout the 19th century the city grew steadily. Industrialization changed the city. With the building of the Central Station at the end of the century, Amsterdam turned its back on its seafaring past and looked towards the mechanical age for its future. The station was built over the old harbor wall and some of the oldest canals in the city center were filled in to allow better access to motorized vehicles. Dam Square was landlocked for the first time in its history.

Magazines are generally published on a regular schedule and contain a variety of content. They are generally financed by advertising, by a purchase price, by prepaid subscriptions, or a combination of the three.At its root, the word \\"magazine\\" refers to a collection or storage location. In the case of written publication, it is a collection of written articles. This explains why magazine publications share the word root with gunpowder magazines, artillery magazines, firearms magazines, and, in French, retail stores such as department stores.  - Niko Nirvi ( born 1961 ) is a long - term major icon in the Finnish gaming world . He is well known for writing computer game reviews since the 1980s in MikroBitti , C = Lehti and the computer game yearbooks that were predecessors of the Pelit magazine . He has worked for the latter since its founding in 1992 , and holds a column in addition to making reviews and other reports . Nirvi began his career as a game reviewer in 1986 on pages of MikroBitti . He had made a bet with his friend that he could get his review published in the magazine . He sent two reviews , Zoids and Uridium and the former was published ( they already had one Uridium review ) . Nirvi wrote reviews and a regular column about new games for Mikrobitti and became the \`\` game editor '' of the magazine . He also wrote reviews for C = Lehti . When Pelit , that concentrated solely on gaming , was founded by the same publisher , Nirvi joined its ranks as an editor , and has written a regular column for each issue .

Photos of him are always either covered or edited in a way that the face is unrecognizable . His personal picture in his articles is usually a gaming or movie character whose face is blurred ( for example Master Chief ) while the rest of the crew 's articles feature their real faces . Wallu 's drawings of Nirvi depict him as a bearded man with Spock 's Vulcan ears . According to Nirvi , his avoidance of publicity started in 1988 , when a MikroBitti reader asked for a photograph of him , which Nirvi instantly declined , and this avoidance has strengthened ever since . Nirvi 's style is typically humorous , and sometimes unorthodox . Some of Nirvi 's most unconventional reviews were published in C = Lehti .

This can be hard in a large group of people.   You will want to get up without attracting attention. Try quickly walking away while the people around you are distracted. But watch where you are going, so you don't bump into someone on accident.  Remain calm. If you seem nervous, people are more likely to notice. If you don't know the people around you, try to walk slowly so you don't attract attention. If you do know the people, try to make a hasty retreat to the bathroom. Don't slouch or cover the spot, because if you do, you will likely attract attention and receive questions. This can be an easy way to cover the wet spot on your pants so you can get to the bathroom. It's best to tie it from the back because that's how normal people tie it. If you have a shirt that is long enough, pull it down so it can cover your front area.   Wrap the jacket around your waist. Remain calm so you don't look suspicious. Act like nothing is wrong. Calmly get to a bathroom or get home. This generally only works if you are at a restaurant or if you have a drink in your hand, and this can be a good cover if you don't have a jacket to cover your pants.  This will give an excuse to why your pants are wet before you can excuse yourself to the restroom. Make a joke that you are clumsy and laugh it off like spilling the drink was an accident. Excuse yourself to the restroom to clean up. You can see if you can clean up the stain or if you need to go home.  Look in the mirror or get into a stall for more privacy. If the stain is minor, you can try cleaning it up. If not, make some excuse to go home.

Among the hotel guests eager to return to England are two British gentlemen, Caldicott and Charters, who are worried about missing the upcoming cricket Test match. The only room left for them is the maid's room. Other Britons are Iris (Margaret Lockwood), a young woman of independent means who has spent a holiday with some friends, now returning home to be married, Miss Froy (May Whitty), an elderly lady who has worked some years abroad as a governess and music teacher, Gilbert (Michael Redgrave), a young musicologist who has been studying the folk songs of the region, and a secretive couple Mr. and Mrs. Todhunter (Cecil Parker and Linden Travers) who are having a clandestine affair. Folk dancers stomp loudly in Gilbert's room just above Iris, making it impossible for Miss Froy to properly hear a musician singing a haunting melody out in the street. Iris bribes the manager to throw Gilbert out of his room. Gilbert retaliates by barging into Iris's room and refusing to leave. Miss Froy seems to particularly enjoy the musician in the street below, and she throws a coin out her window. The music stops, as a murderous hand is seen to strangle the balladeer, but no one seems to notice anything wrong.The next morning, as the passengers are leaving the hotel to board the train, Miss Froy asks Iris for help in finding her luggage. They huddle around a pile of baggage, and just then a flowerpot is pushed off a window ledge from an upper floor. The pot appears meant for Miss Froy, but it knocks Iris on the head, instead.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Question: What could happen to a person if no one is around him or her? Options: - feel lonely - graduate from high school - enter college - cross street - be alone  Explain why a human would choose \\"feel lonely\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"A human would most likely choose \\"feel lonely\\" as the answer to the question \\"What could happen to a person if no one is around him or her?\\" because it directly addresses the emotional and psychological aspects of being isolated from other people. Humans are social beings, and being in contact with others is essential for their mental and emotional wellbeing. The other options provided might be related to personal growth, education, or daily routines, but they do not directly address the core concern of the situation, which is the individual's emotional state without the presence of other people. To further explore the reasons behind choosing \\"feel lonely\\" over the other options, let's break down each option individually: - Graduate from high school: While an individual might graduate from high school during their lifetime, this event is not directly related to the absence of people around them. Graduation is a milestone achievement that usually takes place with the support of educators, family, and friends. Furthermore, it occurs at a specific moment in a person's life, whereas feeling lonely due to isolation can happen to anyone at any time. - Enter college: Similar to the high school graduation scenario, entering college is a significant life event that is not directly associated with the presence or absence of people around an individual. Although college life involves some form of independence, it doesn't necessarily stem from a situation where the person is devoid of any social interactions or human emotional attachment. - Cross street: This daily life activity may initially appear relevant due to its simplicity, yet it does not address the primary concern of the emotional response to a lack of human companionship. Additionally, crossing a street doesn't always require others to be physically present, and it doesn't lead to any significant emotional consequences tied to isolation. - Be alone: While this option might superficially seem to align with the main issue of lacking other people around, it doesn't take into consideration the emotional aspect of loneliness. Being alone can sometimes be a positive or neutral experience, depending on one's preferences or the circumstances. However, feeling lonely indicates a deeper emotional experience of isolation and the longing for human connection. In summary, a human would choose \\"feel lonely\\" as the answer to the question because it acknowledges the psychological and emotional impact of being without others in their life. It emphasizes the need for social connections and the repercussions of lacking such human interactions, which can lead to loneliness. The other options may be important life events or simple activities but do not directly address the emotional context of being away from others."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council.  - The Naval War College (NWC or NAVWARCOL) is the staff college and \\"Home of Thought\\" for the United States Navy in Newport, Rhode Island. The NWC educates and develops leaders, supports defining the future Navy and associated roles and missions, supports combat readiness, and strengthens global maritime partnerships.  - The United States Navy (USN) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States. The U.S. Navy is the largest, most capable navy in the world, with the highest combined battle fleet tonnage. The U.S. Navy has the world's largest aircraft carrier fleet, with ten in service, two in the reserve fleet, and three new carriers under construction. The service has 323,792 personnel on active duty and 108,515 in the Navy Reserve. It has 274 deployable combat vessels and more than 3,700 aircraft in active service .  - Staff colleges (also command and staff colleges and war colleges) train military officers in the administrative, staff and policy aspects of their profession. It is usual for such training to occur at several levels in a career.

Q:Article: My family moved around a lot when I was growing up.In 2nd grade,I lived here in Washington D.C,where I made an amazing group of friends.I was upset when my parents told me we were moving again and I would have to leave all my best friends behind. In 7th grade.we moved back to Washington D.C.And I could not have been more excited and I felt like I was finally home again.But things had changed.There were two new girls,who decided that they didn't like me,which meant no one else could,not even all my former best friends. And then one day during school,I opened my locker,only to find a note lying on the floor.The note said:Die.Nobody likes you. My heart started beating faster and I felt the blood rushing to my face.I had no idea what to do.The note wasn't signed and I had no idea who had written it,but I figured the new girls were behind it.I had to sit in class all day with my head down,wondering who else knew about this shame.I felt horrible and sure that nothing would ever be good again. I decided that the perfect way to end all of this was with another note,left on the bathroom mirror at school. It's sad for someone to bully other classmates to make themselves feel better or look cool.Bullying others is a way to impress others.It's common,but that doesn't mean it's okay.Looking cool is not worth making others feel bad.Obviously I'm very happy now,but it doesn't mean I'11 ever forget about that note or how it made me feel.And to those of you that are current victims  of bullying--know that you are NOT alone.It will get better.I promise.

(Justin Merriman/Getty Images)      Both the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department are overhauling a slew of outside advisory boards that inform how their agencies assess the science underpinning federal policies, the first step in a broader effort by Republicans to change the way the federal government evaluates the scientific basis for its regulations.      EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt decided to replace half of the members on one of its key scientific review boards, while Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is “reviewing the charter and charge” of more than 200 advisory boards, committees and other entities both within and outside his department. EPA and Interior officials began informing current members of the move Friday, and notifications continued over the weekend.      Pruitt’s move could significantly change the makeup of the 18-member Board of Scientific Counselors (BOSC), which advises EPA’s prime scientific arm on whether the research it does has sufficient rigor and integrity, and addresses important scientific questions. All of the people being dismissed were at the end of serving at least one three-year term, although these terms are often renewed instead of terminated.      EPA spokesman J.P. Freire said in an email that “no one has been fired or terminated” and that Pruitt had simply decided to bring in fresh advisers. The agency informed the outside academics on Friday that their terms would not be renewed.      “We’re not going to rubber-stamp the last administration’s appointees. Instead, they should participate in the same open competitive process as the rest of the applicant pool,” Freire said. “This approach is what was always intended for the board, and we’re making a clean break with the last administration’s approach.”      The head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, says he is not convinced carbon dioxide from human activity is the main driver of climate change and wants Congress to weigh in on whether CO2 should be regulated. (Reuters)      [EPA website removes climate science site from public view after two decades]      Separately, Zinke has postponed all outside committees as he reviews their composition and work. The review will effectively freeze the work of the Bureau of Land Management’s 38 resource advisory councils, along with other panels focused on a sweep of issues, from one assessing the threat of invasive species to the science technical advisory panel for Alaska’s North Slope.      “The Secretary is committed to restoring trust in the Department’s decision-making and that begins with institutionalizing state and local input and ongoing collaboration, particularly in communities surrounding public lands,” Interior spokeswoman Heather Swift said by email Monday. “As the Department concludes its review in the weeks ahead, agencies will notice future meetings to ensure that the Department continues to get the benefit of the views of local communities in all decision-making on public land management.”      Greg Zimmerman, deputy director of the non-partisan advocacy group Center for Western Priorities, said in an interview that “it just doesn’t make any sense they would be canceling meetings as they do this analysis.” BLM’s regional advisory councils include officials from the energy and outdoor recreation industry as well as scientists and conservationists, Zimmerman added. “The only reasonable explanation is they don’t want to be hearing from these folks.”      The moves came as a surprise to the agencies’ outside advisers, with several of them taking to Twitter to announce their suspensions.      John Peter Thompson, who chairs Interior’s Invasive Species Advisory Panel, tweeted Monday that he had been notified that “all activities are suspended subject to review by Depart of Interior.”      Members of EPA’s Board of Scientific Counselors had been informed twice — in January, before President Barack Obama left office, and then more recently by EPA career staff members — that they would be kept on for another term, adding to their confusion.      “I was kind of shocked to receive this news,” Robert Richardson, an ecological economist and an associate professor in Michigan State University’s Department of Community Sustainability, said in an interview Sunday.      Richardson, who on Saturday tweeted, “Today, I was Trumped,” said that he was at the end of an initial three-year term but that members traditionally have served two such stints. “I’ve never heard of any circumstance where someone didn’t serve two consecutive terms,” he said, adding that the dismissals gave him “great concern that objective science is being marginalized in this administration.”      Courtney Flint, a professor of natural resource sociology at Utah State University who had served one term on the board, said in an email that she was also surprised to learn that her term would not be renewed, “particularly since I was told that such a renewal was expected.” But she added, “In the broader view, I suppose it is the prerogative of this administration to set the goals of federal agencies and to appoint members to advisory boards.”      [EPA just buried its climate site for kids]      Ryan Jackson, Pruitt’s chief of staff, noted in an email that all the board members whose terms are not being renewed could reapply for their positions. “I’m not quite sure why some EPA career staff simply get angry by us opening up the process,” he said. “It seems unprofessional to me.”      Yet Terry F. Yosie, who directed EPA’s Science Advisory Board from 1981 to 1988, noted in an email that the Board of Scientific Counselors does not report directly to the administrator or his office. “It’s quite extraordinary that such a body would receive this level of attention by the Administrator’s office,” he said.      And Rush Holt, CEO of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, expressed concern and said he hoped Pruitt reconsidered his decision. “Academic scientists play a critical role in informing policy with scientific research results at every level, including the federal government,” he said.      Pruitt is planning a much broader overhaul of how the agency conducts its scientific analysis, said a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Pruitt has been meeting with academics to talk about the matter and putting thought into which areas of investigation warrant attention from the agency’s scientific advisers.      The agency may consider industry scientific experts for some of the board positions as long as these appointments do not pose a conflict of interest, Freire said.      Conservatives have complained for years about EPA’s approach to science, including the input it receives from outside scientific bodies. Both the Board of Scientific Counselors and the 47-member Scientific Advisory Board have come under criticism for bolstering the cause for greater federal regulation.      A majority of the members of the Board of Scientific Counselors have terms expiring this fiscal year, along with the terms of 12 members of the Scientific Advisory Board. GOP lawmakers have frequently criticized the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC)—a committee within the Scientific Advisory Board—for its recommendation that the EPA impose much stricter curbs on smog-forming ozone. The seven-person panel, which is charged under the Clean Air Act to review the scientific basis of all ambient air quality standards, is legally required to have a medical doctor and a member of the National Academy of Sciences as members.      Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.), who questions the link between human activity and climate change and has several former aides now working for Pruitt, said in an interview earlier this year that under the new administration, “they’re going to have to start dealing with science, and not rigged science.”      House Science Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Tex.) held a hearing on the issue in February, arguing that the Scientific Advisory Board should be expanded to include more non-academics. The panel, which was established in 1978, is primarily made up of academic scientists and other experts who review EPA’s research to ensure that the regulations the agency undertakes have a sound scientific basis.      “The EPA routinely stacks this board with friendly scientists who receive millions of dollars in grants from the federal government,” Smith said at the time. “The conflict of interest here is clear.”      In a budget proposal obtained by The Washington Post last month, the panel’s operating budget is slated for an 84 percent cut — or 542,000 — for fiscal 2018. That money typically covers travel and other expenses for outside experts who attend the board’s public meetings.      The document said the budget cut reflects “an anticipated lower number of peer reviews.”      Joe Arvai, a member of the Scientific Advisory Board who directs the University of Michigan’s Erb Institute for Global Sustainable Enterprise, said in an email that Pruitt and his colleagues should keep in mind that the board’s membership, just like its standing and ad hoc panels, “already includes credible scientists from industry” and that its “work on agency rulemaking is open to public viewing and comment. So, if diversity of thought and transparency are the administrator’s concerns, his worries are misplaced because the SAB already has these bases covered.      “So, if you ask me, his moves over the weekend — as well as the House bill to reform the SAB — are attempts to use the SAB as a political toy,” Arvai said. “By making these moves, the administrator and members of the House can pander to the president’s base by looking like they’re getting tough on all those pesky ‘liberal scientists.’ But, all else being equal, nothing fundamentally changes about how the SAB operates.”      Chris Mooney contributed to this report.

Information:  - Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term.  - Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Europe. The southernmost and smallest of the Nordic countries, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. The Kingdom of Denmark is the sovereign state that comprises Denmark proper and two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark has a total area of , and a population of 5.7 million. The country consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands, with the largest being Zealand and Funen.

Movie title: Case Closed: Strategy Above the Depths Context: The 9th annual Detective Conan movie sets sail on a 100 million yen luxurious cruise. Fifteen years ago, a cruise named Yashiromaru, built by the Yashiro group, sank while sailing. In the present, a new cruise, the Saint Aphrodite, was built by the Yashiro group and Conan and the rest were invited through Sonoko. Earlier, the husband of the CEO of the Yashiro family group, an established ship architect, had a heart-attack and drove his car down a cliff. On the second day of the cruise, the CEO herself was found murdered in her room. Later, her father, the President of the Yashiro group was also found missing. He had been thrown off the cruise into the ocean, seemingly by the same person. At the welcoming party, Kogorou shows off his deduction skills, and concluded that the sub-designer of the cruise, Akiyoshi, was the murderer. However, Conan has different ideas. Kusaka, a scriptwriter who worked in co-operation with Akiyoshi on a script, was the culprit. Kusaka reveals that the accident from 15 years ago was a scheme to sink the ship deliberately to get insurance. His father was murdered when he discovered the captain of the ship was drugged and left to die. Kusaka immediately set off bombs and escaped by sea and the Detective Boys gave chase. After they successfully took down the criminal, more bombs were ignited. All passengers were evacuated, but Ran returned to her hiding place during the hide-and-seek game to find a \\"gold medal\\" made by sea-shells the Detective Boys made for her. However, as the ship swayed, she fainted in the enclosed area.It turns out Akiyoshi was the main murderer after all, and she was the one who did all three killings and made Kusaka think that he did them himself. She also revealed that her father was the captain who died while the cruise ship sank. Kogorou, however, deduced correctly this time and managed to arrest Akiyoshi. He was originally trying to find evidence to prove her innocence because of her strong resemblance to his wife, but the more investigation he does, the more...

Step 3: Identify missing information The sentence does not specifically mention the term \\"phonology.\\" Step 4: Determine if the sentence answers the question Since the sentence does not mention phonology, it does not directly answer the question \\"What part of a language can phonology as a word also refer to?\\" However, the sentence does provide information about fundamental systems of a language. To answer the question, we need to consider whether phonology can be considered a fundamental system of a language— Step 5: Consider if phonology can be considered a part of a language Phonology is the study of the sound systems of languages. It is a fundamental component of a language, just like syntax (rules governing sentence structure) and vocabulary (a set of words and their meanings).

(CNN) -- Manchester United went top of the English Premier League on Saturday with a 2-1 win over Liverpool at Old Trafford, but it was Luis Suarez who grabbed the headlines again. Suarez, who was starting his first match since returning from an eight-match ban for racially abusing United defender Patrice Evra last October, refused to shake the French international's hand as the team's lined up before the match. Suarez fined, suspended over racist remarks It was the precursor to a fractious encounter with both sets of players reportedly clashing in the tunnel at halftime and having to be restrained after the final whistle.

Given the question \\"How would Remy feel afterwards?\\", is \\"like a bad neighbor\\" a valid answer? Select from: a). Yes. b). No. The answer is:","output":"b). No. The answer is \\"No\\" because the given information states that Remy met Riley's neighbors, who seemed to be nice people. There is no mention or indication that Remy was acting hostile or exhibited any negative behaviors during the interaction. Therefore, we cannot assume Remy would feel like a bad neighbor afterwards. It's likely that Remy would feel positively about the encounter, given that the neighbors appeared to be agreeable and friendly. In addition, friendly interactions with neighbors can contribute to the development of a sense of community and mutual support, which is essential in fostering healthy relationships within a neighborhood. To expand our understanding of the possible feelings that Remy might experience after meeting Riley's neighbors, we could consider the following options: 1. Grateful for having pleasant neighbors - If Remy finds Riley's neighbors likable and approachable, they might feel thankful for having good people living nearby. This can increase Remy and Riley's comfort and satisfaction with their living situation. 2. Relieved to have resolved any doubts or concerns about the neighbors - By meeting and getting to know them, Remy can address any potential worries, preconceived notions, or misconceptions about the neighbors. As a result, they may feel relieved or reassured. 3. Motivated to foster stronger connections within the neighborhood - After having positive interactions with the neighbors, Remy might feel encouraged to further strengthen the relationships by organizing activities or engaging in collaborative efforts within the community. 4. Curious to learn more about the neighbors - Remy might be interested in discovering more about the neighbors beyond their initial impressions, which could lead to future conversations, shared interests, and deeper connections. In conclusion, it's not valid to assume Remy would feel \\"like a bad neighbor\\" after meeting Riley's neighbors, especially given that they appeared to be nice people. It is more reasonable to explore various positive emotions or thoughts Remy might have after the encounter, as these would better align with the provided information."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  Since the recording of \\"Good Vibrations\\" in 1966, Wilson had established a new method of operation. Instead of working on whole songs with clear large-scale syntactical structures, Wilson limited himself to recording short interchangeable fragments (or \\"modules\\"). Through the method of tape splicing, each fragment could then be assembled into a linear sequence, allowing any number of larger structures and divergent moods to be produced at a later time. Smiley Smile continued this approach. The album also continued Brian's exploration of \\"party tracks\\"—a form of music which includes the sounds of people shouting and making noises, as if at a party. Brian had enacted this approach with Beach Boys' Party! in 1965, thereby mixing that record's style with the modular composition method he devised for \\"Good Vibrations\\". Most of Smiley Smile was recorded at Brian's improvised home studio in Bel Air from June 3 to July 14, 1967. The core instrumentation consisted of organ, honky-tonk piano, and electronic bass played by the Beach Boys themselves, rather than the session musicians employed in much of their previous work. Brian became obsessed with a three-tiered Baldwin organ during the album's recording, resulting in a more minimalist approach to the new arrangements. The organ gave the album its central timbre.  Most of the piano was played by Brian, and most of the bass was played by Carl. Tape manipulation was another prominent feature, with varispeed being applied to a few miscellaneous vocals. On \\"She's Goin' Bald\\", a new device called the Eltro Information Rate Changer was used to raise the pitch of the group's vocals without affecting the tempo.It was the first album for which production was credited to the entire group, instead of Brian alone. Dennis explained: \\"He wanted it that way. He said 'It's produced by the Beach Boys.'\\" When asked if Brian was \\"still the producer of Smiley Smile\\", Carl answered, \\"Most definitely.\\" Brian acknowledged: \\"We had done about six months work on another thing, but we jumped...  answer the following question:  What is the name of the group whose vocal pitch was raised by a new device called the Eltro Information Rate Changer?

First, we have the math problem: 1359 * y + 1192 = -11039 2. Now, we want to find out what y is. So, we need to get y by itself on one side of the equation. To do that, we can subtract 1192 from both sides. 3. After subtracting, we get:    1359 * y = -11039 - 1192 4. Now let's actually subtract the numbers on the right side (-11039 - 1192):    1359 * y = -12231 5. Next, we want y by itself, so we need to divide both sides of the equation by 1359 (the number that y is multiplied by). 6. When we divide, we get:    y = -12231 / 1359 7.

If you have a bad reputation among friends, maybe it is time to spend time with different people. Maybe your friends are encouraging habits that make people think poorly of you. At work, toxic employment environments can create unreasonable expectations of people. A work environment which encourages an unhealthy work-life balance can make it seem that a hard working, dedicated individual is lazy. Examine your workplace culture, and think about whether or not a value clash is causing your reputation to suffer. You may want to find a new job. This can be a very difficult thing to accomplish. But when you see yourself through the eyes of others, and you don't like what you're looking at, make a change. Changing yourself is hard because we develop strong patterns and habits in life. However, by making big changes in your behavior, people will take notice. This will change how they see you, and it may cause others to re-evaluate their perceptions of you as a person.  Seek professional help, such as a therapist or psychiatrist. Find a life coach or a spiritual guide to help you find ways to make internal changes. Superficial change is not the same as an authentic change. Inauthentic behavior is hard to keep consistent. When you're not being authentic, people notice. Real change is harder than pretending to be different.","output":"External factors like friends, habits, and workplace can influence your reputation. Toxic environments may cause issues, so consider making changes to improve your situation. If faced with a negative reputation, evaluate your surroundings and relationships, and be prepared to make changes. Authentic change is challenging but crucial, and seeking professional help or guidance can facilitate genuine transformation. In doing so, others may re-evaluate their perceptions of you."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

Antonioni really showed some 'cojones' when he had this movie made. He went to America working under a contract from the most lavish studio (MGM) and he made the most damning portrait of American society i've ever seen. Having seen LA first hand this is the most accurate portrayal of the crowded, overheated and impersonal city. If only Antonioni had met Bill Hicks... The subsequent burial by the studio is understandable, after such a whopping investment and dismal return. It is sad that people don't get to see this film any more as i believe Antonioni has been proved right. Here he predicts the end of the hippie/civil rights movement in the politics of America. Everyone is much more interested in what goes into their pockets and the relentless expansion of living space into the inhospitable (yet beautiful) desert and beyond. How i would love to see interest in this film re-kindled and a lavish DVD release. I beseech people to watch Zabriskie Point with an open mind and an open heart.

Your summary should not be very short, but it's better if it's not more than 30 words. Problem:Plan recognition aims to look for target plans to best explain the observed actions based on plan libraries and/or domain models. Despite the success of previous approaches on plan recognition, they mostly rely on correct action observations.   Recent advances in visual activity recognition have the potential of enabling applications such as automated video surveillance. Effective approaches for such problems would require the ability to recognize the plans of agents from video information. Traditional plan recognition algorithms rely on access to detailed planning domain models. One recent promising direction involves learning approximate (or shallow) domain models directly from the observed activity sequences. Such plan recognition approaches expect observed action sequences as inputs. However, visual inference results are often noisy and uncertain, typically represented as a distribution over possible actions. In this work, we develop a visual plan recognition framework that recognizes plans with an approximate domain model learned from uncertain visual data. Solution:","output":"This research develops a visual plan recognition framework that identifies plans using an approximate domain model, learned from uncertain visual data, addressing limitations of traditional algorithms that rely on correct action observations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. This is a beauty myth that I have been wanting to bust for a while as I am surprised how many people actually believe it. I am quite vain so hate having visible grey hairs. Having naturally dark brown hair means that even a single grey hair is very noticeable. From the age of about 22 or 23 I discovered that I had about five grey hairs floating about. As soon as I could see them I'd pull them out. Then, a few months later when they were rearing their ugly heads again - pluck, out they'd come again! Up until I was about 27 or 28 I only had these 5 grey hairs, well that was all I could find anyway. Then from 28 onwards they have been inviting their friends and relatives to move in and I am slowly losing the plucking battle (side note: this increase in grey hairs at 28 was also the year that I got married...I wonder if their is any correlation between getting married and going grey??). Whenever I was having a conversation with someone about grey hairs and I'd mention that I pull mine out, they'd look at me horrified - 'you can't do that, seven more will grow back in its place' they would all warn me. Even my hairdresser was horrified that I plucked my grey hairs. One day when she was straightening my hair I could see a stray grey sticking up and it was driving me crazy. I asked her to pull it out and she refused saying that I'd end up with more if she pulled it out. I have never believed this old wives tale, mostly because for five years I kept plucking my greys yet they didn't increase in number. Plus it made no sense to me. Why would plucking greys cause more greys to grow when the same is not true for your coloured hair. Imagine if it were true - that would mean that the cure for baldness would be to pluck out your hair as each hair you pluck causes seven more to grow in its place - doesn't really make sense, does it? Or worse, each time you waxed your legs, seven hairs replaced each pulled one - what state would your legs be in now?

That includes a 200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from 900,000 to 1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was 374,062, the report states. Newman also has a 5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states. The company did not respond to an e-mail from CNN seeking comment. The April 20, 2010, explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig injured 17 workers and killed 11 others, including nine Transocean employees, according to the SEC filing. It has been called the worst spill in U.S. history. The well was capped three months later, but not before millions of barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf.

You can buy these right away. If the item is being auctioned, you offer the highest price you are prepared to pay and eBay bids for you.The bid will be increased little by little until it goes beyond your highest bid, then you are emailed and asked if you would like to bid again. Auctions last up to 10 days, and when they finish you get an email telling you whether you have won the item. How to pay: Sellers decide how they would like to be paid and you need to check this before placing a bid as you might not want to post a cheque or postal orders. The easiest way is through PayPal, an online payment system that takes the money away from your credit card.

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the group that wanted to return to their old recording ethos of \\"the band in a room playing together\\"? from the following article ?  Following the mixed success of their musical pursuits in the 1990s, U2 sought to simplify their sound; the Edge said that with Pop, the group had \\"taken the deconstruction of the rock 'n' roll band format to its absolute 'nth degree\\". For their tenth album, All That You Can't Leave Behind, the group wanted to return to their old recording ethos of \\"the band in a room playing together\\". Reuniting with Eno and Lanois, U2 began working on the album in late 1998. After their experiences with being pressured to complete Pop, the band were content to work without deadlines. With Bono's schedule limited by his commitments to debt relief for Jubilee 2000 and the other band members spending time with their families, the recording sessions stretched through August 2000.Released in October of that year, All That You Can't Leave Behind was seen by critics as a \\"back to basics\\" album, on which the group returned to a more mainstream, conventional rock sound. For many of those not won over by the band's forays into dance music, it was considered a return to grace; Rolling Stone called it U2's \\"third masterpiece\\" alongside The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby. The album debuted at number one in 32 countries and sold 12 million copies. Its lead single, \\"Beautiful Day\\", was a worldwide hit, reaching number one in Ireland, the UK, Australia, and Canada, while peaking at number 21 in the US. The song earned Grammy Awards for Song of the Year, Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, and Record of the Year. At the awards ceremony, Bono declared that U2 were \\"reapplying for the job ... [of] the best band in the world\\". The album's other singles were worldwide hits as well; \\"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\\", \\"Elevation\\", and \\"Walk On\\" reached number one in Canada, while charting in the top five in the UK and top ten in Australia.","output":"The group that wanted to return to their old recording ethos of \\"the band in a room playing together\\" is U2 as stated in the article.  The process of finding the answer started from the question, which is asking for the name of a group. Understanding that, I then referred to the passage given by scanning it for any mentions of groups or bands. I found \\"U2\\" to be the group mentioned consistently throughout the passage. Later, the passage confirms that this is the correct group with the line, \\"For their tenth album, All That You Can't Leave Behind, the group wanted to return to their old recording ethos of 'the band in a room playing together'\\". From these two scenarios, it is justified to conclude that U2 is the group mentioned in the question."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher. Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer.

I just love diamonds and I love dark spaces. Maybe I'll just live in the cave and be a creature.    Response 1: In my cave, you are welcome to dwell. Let's get on my bike and ride like hell.    Response 2: Yes, but that's just what you tell people when you go to college parties so that you can make out with the cute young guys. 2. Remember that \\"Yes, and\\" is about accepting and expanding on the original statement. 3. Analyze the two responses:    - Response 1 allows the speaker to live in the cave and also suggests an action afterwards (riding the bike).    - Response 2 contradicts the speaker's desire to live in the cave and brings up an unrelated topic (college parties). 4.

Background: Epstein was born to a secular Jewish family in New York City and raised in Brookline, Massachusetts. He attended Brookline High School (a 1991 graduate), and played baseball for the Brookline High School Warriors, but dreamed of working for the Red Sox. Epstein attended Yale University where he lived at Jonathan Edwards College. He served as sports editor of the Yale Daily News. Context: On October 12, 2011, Epstein agreed to a five-year contract worth 18.5 million with the Chicago Cubs. On October 19, 2011, it was reported that Epstein's official title with the Cubs would be President and that San Diego Padres general manager Jed Hoyer would take the GM position with the Cubs.  On October 23, 2011, he took out a full-page ad in The Boston Globe, thanking Red Sox fans and the team's owners for their support. Two days later, the Cubs officially introduced Epstein as president of baseball operations. While the Red Sox were already a winning team when Epstein was hired in Boston, the Cubs were coming off a fifth-place finish in the National League Central and had a depleted farm system. The Cubs finished in last place in the National League Central for the first three years of Epstein's presidency, as the focus was to acquire young talent rather than maximize short-term competitiveness. After a three-year, top-to-bottom rebuild, the Cubs clinched a playoff berth in 2015; their first since 2008. They advanced to the National League Championship Series, where they were swept by the New York Mets.  Epstein re-signed with the club on September 28, 2016, with a five-year contract estimated to be worth up to 25million. The Cubs finished the 2016 season with a 103-58 record, the best in the MLB and their best since the 1910 season. In the playoffs, they defeated the San Francisco Giants in the NLDS. The Cubs proceeded to beat the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS, winning their first pennant since the 1945 season and sending them to the World Series. The Cubs then won their first World Series championship since 1908, when they defeated the Cleveland Indians in 7 games, breaking the so-called \\"Curse of the Billy Goat\\". Question: did he set any records?. Whats the answer?","output":"Theodore \\"Theo\\" Nathaniel Epstein is an American baseball executive who is best known for being the youngest general manager (GM) in the history of Major League Baseball (MLB) when he was hired as the Boston Red Sox GM at the age of 28. He set a record as the youngest GM to win a World Series, when the Red Sox won the championship in 2004, breaking the \\"Curse of the Bambino\\".  Additionally, by leading both the Red Sox and Chicago Cubs to their first World Series titles in 86 and 108 years, respectively, Epstein gained recognition for breaking two of the most famous championship droughts in sports history. While he did not set any explicit records with these achievements, his accomplishments in managing both teams to historic victories have solidified his place as one of the most successful and well-regarded executives in MLB history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In addition, clearing often involves burning, which releases carbon dioxide that was previously stored in autotrophs.  John has been hearing about climate change for last couple of years. He wants to understand the science behind climate change. For that, he picked up two eras in earth's history, era A and era B. Era A was hundred thousand years ago, and era B is in the present day. He now wants to compare these to eras to understand the change in climate better.  Would era A have more or less carbon dioxide in the air than era B? Answer:","output":"Era A would have less carbon dioxide in the air than Era B. This is because human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, have significantly increased the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in recent times (Era B). In contrast, Era A, which was a hundred thousand years ago, did not have these human-driven factors contributing to increased carbon dioxide levels."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

You get to try each of the 4 levels of beds they have within a 7 day period. I know tanning is bad but I rarely do it and didn't want to get burned on an upcoming beach trip.  My trial went really well until the final day when the girl didn't do a good job of recommending the time for a brand new level 3 bed which left me completely burnt. This is my health we are talking about here and all she was concerned with was selling me a package.   Day 1 - I signed up and was talked into buy lotion even though I had some. My own fault but from then on, the girl was beyond nice to me.  I tried the level 1 bed for 7 mins. After my face a slightly red but nothing major.   Day 3 - I tried the level 2 bed and the same girl was nice enough to recommend I try 8 mins but cover my face if it starts to feel hot. I did and i ended up with a little but of redness on my chest as well but again nothing major.  Day 5 - I walked in and the place was packed. After waiting for 10 mins, I decided I would run some errands and stop back after. When I got back, all the level 3 beds were full so I did the level 4 bed. She recommended since I was red at 8 mins in the level 2 that I try 7 mins in the level 4 bed. It worked out perfectly. i covered my face and chest when they started to get hot like she recommended and came out with out any redness.   Day 7 - My last day. since I had not tried the level 3 bed that is what i had left to do. This time it was a different girl. I told her i wanted to do level 3 and that 7 mins in the level 4 was fine but 8 in the level 2 was too much. So would 7 mins in the 3 be okay. She asked how i liked my lotion and if i wanted to try anything else. Then tried to sell me a package. I told her i wanted to think about it and she was quick to say okay your set in room 3. This is where everything went wrong. I left the salon feeling okay but with in hours could tell I was burned. Besides my face and chest where i had covered it part of the time I was completely burnt. You can completely tell where the bed does not get like my sides were not red at all. The issue with paying your staff on commission is that customer service often goes out the window when all they care about is selling.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: In the United States, you’ll need to select a business structure before you register your business. Examples include a limited liability company (LLC) and sole proprietorship. The best choice depends on your personal assets and tax liability, so ask your attorney or accountant which structure suits your needs. An LLC is the best choice for many small business owners, especially if you want to protect your personal assets. Your personal vehicle, home, and other assets won't be at risk if your business faces bankruptcy or lawsuits. To register your business with the IRS (Internal Revenue Service), you’ll need to apply for an employer identification number (EIN), which is free. Registration procedures vary by state; in general, you’ll file your business name, declare its structure, and pay registration fees.  Apply online for an EIN here: https://sa.www4.irs.gov/modiein/individual/index.jsp. Find your state’s business registration procedures here: https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/state-government-websites. In the United States, you’ll need to apply for a Motor Carrier Authority Number and US DOT number with the Department of Transportation. If you only plan on traveling within state lines, you may only need an intrastate DOT number.  Find your state’s DOT requirements here: https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/about/webstate.cfm. For locations outside of the United States, check with your department of transportation or other appropriate agency about licensing requirements. For example, in the United Kingdom, you’ll need to apply for a good vehicle operating license with the Traffic Commissioners of Great Britain. In the United States, you’ll need to file a Heavy Highway Vehicle Use Tax Form (2290) with the IRS. Additionally, you’ll have to pay standard business taxes, including income tax, self-employment tax, employment taxes (if you hire employees), and applicable excise taxes, such as fuel tax. Check with your nation’s revenue service if you live outside of the United States. There are strict federal and state regulations on trucking business insurance. Contact your insurance provider or look online to find an independent insurance agent. Ask them to recommend a policy that complies with federal and state standards. In the United States, total insurance costs for trucking businesses average around 6,500 (USD) per year. Summary:","output":"When starting a trucking business in the United States, you must first choose a business structure, such as a limited liability company (LLC) or sole proprietorship, based on personal assets and tax liability. Consult an attorney or accountant to determine the best option. An LLC can protect personal assets from bankruptcy or lawsuits. Registration involves applying for an Employer Identification Number (EIN) with the IRS and following state-specific procedures for declaring your business name, structure, and paying fees.

Answer:","output":"The missing first step in this process is the increase in blood sugar levels, often due to consumption of food or as a response to stress. When carbohydrates are consumed and broken down, glucose (a type of sugar) is released into the bloodstream, which leads to an increase in blood sugar levels. This triggers the rest of the process, as follows: 1. Increase in blood sugar levels: After consuming food, particularly carbohydrates, or as a response to stress, blood sugar levels rise as glucose enters the bloodstream. 2. Bloodstream: The increased blood sugar circulates throughout the body, providing energy for cells and tissues. High blood sugar levels can be harmful if not managed properly. 3. The pancreas: In response to the elevated blood sugar levels, the pancreas, a gland situated behind the stomach, detects the change and releases the hormone insulin. 4. Insulin lowers sugar levels: Insulin acts as a key, allowing glucose to enter the cells where it can be used for energy. This helps lower blood sugar levels, ensuring that they remain within a healthy range. 5. Blood sugar goes back to normal: As insulin effectively transfers glucose from the bloodstream into the cells, blood sugar levels return to their normal range. This prevents potential harmful effects of high blood sugar, such as damage to blood vessels, nerves, and organs. To summarize, the missing first step in this process is the increase in blood sugar levels, which initiates the body's response to regulate and maintain blood sugar levels within a healthy range through the release of insulin from the pancreas."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, to make the answer more comprehensive, you could expand on the benefits and even mention some potential limitations of friendlies. Here is a more detailed and longer answer to the question: International friendlies give team managers the opportunity to experiment with various aspects of their team, including selection, tactics, and formations, before participating in competitive tournaments. These matches are crucial for managers as they offer them a chance to assess the abilities of players they may potentially choose for the tournament squad, as well as determining the most suitable playing style for the team. Some key points to consider include: 1. Team Selection: Friendlies allow managers to test different combinations of players, helping them find the best fit to achieve their tactical goals. They can also include new, untested players from domestic leagues, giving them a chance to prove their worth on the international stage. 2. Tactics: Managers can use friendlies to analyze and adapt their tactics, formations, and strategies. This enables them to implement adjustments during the matches, observe the results, and learn from any mistakes that may occur. 3. Morale and Team Chemistry: Friendlies can play an important role in improving team morale and chemistry. Allowing players to familiarize themselves with one another and work together to achieve objectives can create a sense of unity and cohesion that benefits the team in competitive matches. 4. Evaluate Opposition: Friendlies against teams from the same continent or with similar playing styles can offer valuable insights into potential opponents during the main tournament. This allows managers to make informed decisions about which players and tactics will be most effective against specific opponents. 5. Assess Fitness Levels: Managers can use friendlies to gauge the fitness levels of their players, including how well they have recovered from injuries. This helps them plan their preparations for the upcoming tournaments accordingly. However, it is worth noting that there are potential limitations to international friendlies. Depending on the schedule and travel requirements, these matches could be a source of physical strain on players who already have demanding schedules with their club teams. Additionally, the competitive nature of these encounters may be less intense than that of official tournaments, so they may not exactly replicate the tournament conditions. Overall though, international friendlies do provide managers with valuable opportunities to carry out experiments and make informed decisions to optimize their team's performance and success in the competitive arena."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:     Choices:  - oxygen  - hydrogen  - carbon  - energy   A: Answer:","output":"After reading the given paragraph and considering the available choices, the correct answer is that starch represents a supply of energy. Starch is a carbohydrate made up of glucose subunits joined together through multiple glycosidic bonds. Glucose serves as the primary cellular fuel, as it gets broken down through a series of biochemical reactions in a process called cellular respiration. This process generates ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is the molecule that cells use as a direct source of energy to perform a wide range of functions. Since glucose is the building block of starch, the storage of glucose in the form of starch offers cells a reserve to draw on when their immediate energy requirements demand it.

The article tells the story of a little girl who spends her summers on her grandfather's farm and befriends the white ducks with orange feet. The ducks lived in a wooden house near the road and would walk down to the pond every day to swim. The little girl would sit on the bank, watch them, and even talk to them. One day, the ducks went missing, and no one would tell the little girl where they were. She was afraid to ask about their whereabouts. Then, a dinner was served, and the food resembled chicken. The girl didn't want to eat, which implies she had a suspicion or realization that the meal might, in fact, be the ducks she had come to love. Based on the context and the girl's reaction, it's more likely that the ducks were on the plate rather than any of the other options, such as under the water, in the wooden house, or swimming in the pond. The emotional impact of the story comes from the idea that the ducks may have become a meal for the family, and this revelation helps us understand why the girl was hesitant to eat the food."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

I love the swashbuckling air of Georgette Heyer's more usual Regency romances: the controlled, half-concealed violence of her Duke of Avon and her Earl of Rule--the lace and steel. I also love Georgette Heyer's usual clever dialogue: those heroes' biting irony and their wicked wit. It just happens that 'A Civil Contract' is not like that.Here, instead, we have an essentially gentle story, with a hero who, though a soldier, never speaks an unkind or angry word. Financial adversity forces Lord Lynton to give up the woman whom he loves with a passion, and who idolises him as a dashing soldier, and to make a marriage of convenience with the daughter of the rich but unspeakably vulgar Jonathan Chawleigh. But despite all that it is a nice and eventually happy story, in which everyone ends up getting, not perhaps what they want, but, better yet, what makes them happy. Answer: OPT: [1]. No; [2].

However, little research has been done to develop measures of HFPB. The main objective of this paper is to describe the development of a measure of HFPB using annotated food purchase receipts.', 'Households collected and annotated food purchase receipts for a four-week period as part of the baseline assessment of a household nutrition intervention. Receipts were collected from all food sources, including grocery stores and restaurants. Households (n = 90) were recruited from the community as part of an obesity prevention intervention conducted in 2007-2008 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. Household primary shoppers were trained to follow a standardized receipt collection and annotation protocol. Annotated receipts were mailed weekly to research staff. Staff coded the receipt data and entered it into a database. Total food dollars, proportion of food dollars, and ounces of food purchased were examined for different food sources and food categories. Descriptive statistics and correlations are presented.', 'A total of 2,483 receipts were returned by 90 households. Home sources comprised 45% of receipts and eating-out sources 55%.

It has been generally described as avant-pop, indie pop, art pop, indie electronic, indie rock, post-rock, experimental rock, and experimental pop.The band have played on vintage electronic keyboards and synthesizers from brands such as Farfisa and Vox and Moog. Gane has praised the instruments for their versatility: \\"We use the older effects because they're more direct, more extreme, and they're more like plasticine: you can shape them into loads of things.\\" The 1994 album Mars Audiac Quintet prominently features Moog synthesizers.

The interior decor does look charming :(","output":"The review presented can be categorized as negative with a slight tinge of positive sentiments. The main focus of the review exhibits dissatisfaction, disappointment and an unfavorable experience overall. Several factors contribute to these negative feelings: 1. Being closed during normal business hours: The customer had expectations of the establishment being open at the mentioned time, which is typically considered a standard business hour. The unanticipated closure and lack of notice led to disappointment on behalf of the customer. 2. Inaccessibility to the staff: In addition to the physical closure, the customer experienced further frustration as they were unable to get any response over the phone or see anyone in the window. This demonstrates ineffective communication from the establishment and may leave a lasting impression on the customer's view of their reliability and trustworthiness. 3. Unfulfilled potential: The frowning emoticon and phrasing of \\"The interior decor does look charming\\" indicate that the customer saw potential in the place. They could have had a positive experience and appreciated the interior decor if they had been able to access the establishment properly. The inability to experience this firsthand further contributes to the negative tone of the review. However, the slight positive sentiment comes from the mention of the charming interior decor, indicating that the customer acknowledges at least one positive aspect of the establishment.

If Folkloric  The Bedouin of the Sinai have a fascinating lifestyle., can we conclude that \\"Folkloric The Bedouin of the Sinai are nomadic and live in portable tents.\\"?","output":"It is essential to understand both the concept of folkloric and the Bedouin lifestyle in the Sinai before making conclusions about their nomadic nature and living conditions. Folkloric refers to the traditional beliefs, customs, and stories of a community, passed through generations by word of mouth and cultural practices. In the context of the Bedouin of the Sinai, their fascinating folkloric lifestyle is made up of their long-standing culture, values, and historical experiences. The Bedouin, usually found in regions like the Sinai Peninsula, are traditionally nomadic people, known for traveling from place to place in deserts and arid regions. Their nomadic lifestyle allows them to survive harsh climates by seeking water and grazing areas for their herds of sheep, goats, and camels. The Bedouin have expertly adapted to their environment, which is one reason why their lifestyle may be considered fascinating. Over the centuries, they have developed a unique set of skills and knowledge to thrive and maintain their way of life in an otherwise inhospitable landscape. These skills include tracking, navigation, water sourcing, and herbal medicine knowledge. Additionally, the Bedouin are known for their strong bonds within their tribes and a strict code of honor. This code includes hospitality, courage, and loyalty to family and community. Now, considering the Bedouin's folkloric lifestyle, we can conclude that they are nomadic people. Their nomadic nature is not only a result of their personal choices, but also a necessity for survival in the harsh desert climate of the Sinai. In this context, it is accurate to say that \\"Folkloric The Bedouin of the Sinai are nomadic.\\" As for their living conditions, portable tents are indeed a significant part of their traditional lifestyle. These tents, known as \\"beit al-sha'ar\\" or \\"house of black hair,\\" are primarily constructed from woven goat and camel hair. The black tents are specifically designed for the Bedouin's nomadic way of life, as they are lightweight, easy to dismantle and transport, as well as able to provide shade from the scorching sun and wind. Furthermore, the portable tents have unique structural features that adapt to the desert environment. The tents' black color absorbs heat during the cold desert mornings and reduces the sun penetration during the hottest parts of the day. The woven fabric allows for ventilation due to its slightly porous nature, maintaining a more comfortable indoor temperature. In conclusion, by considering the folkloric lifestyle of the Bedouin of the Sinai, we can correctly conclude that they are nomadic and live in portable tents. Their nomadic way of life and living conditions are not only fascinating but have been ingeniously adapted to their environment for generations, making them well-suited to survive and thrive in the harsh landscapes of the Sinai Peninsula."},{"instruction":"Information:  - A political party is a group of people who come together to contest elections and hold power in the government.

Many of the patterns in here are quite intuitive; meaning, that one probably doesn't need a book to be able to figure out how to knit them. Books with felting patterns should highlight patterns that are difficult to create. Otherwise, what's the point of buying a book? The challenges of felting are in determining scale and ratio, and anticipating shrinkage when you felt the item. None of these patterns are particularly interesting or nice-looking.Given its 2003 press date, I would have liked to see more fashionable items like a bucket hat, a striped felted bag with closure, and more useful household items, like a fruit bowl.

Proposed new rules aim to improve food safety. Officials say the changes could prevent more than one million cases of food-related illnesses each year. The new rules were proposed this month, exactly two years after President Obama signed the Food Safety Modernization Act. The rules are the first step in putting the law into effect, making the biggest changes in food safety since the 1930s. The law makes the Food and Drug Administration responsible for preventing food-related illnesses. Experts say this is a change from the role that the FDA has played in the past in reacting to disease outbreaks  . Congress passed the law after a series of outbreaks linked to bagged spinach, peanut butter and other foods. Margaret Hamburg is commissioner of the FDA. \\"They occurred because of problems that would have been solved by these kinds of approaches. So I think, you know>> we're very optimistic that we will begin to see the real change. \\" The agency is proposing to require food manufacturers to show that they have identified   where contamination   is most likely to happen. Manufacturers would also have to show that they have taken steps to prevent it. The proposed rules also deal with safety in growing and harvesting fruits and vegetables. Caroline Smith DeWaal is director for food safety at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. She says the rules should have been released a year ago. And she notes, \\"The bigger question is, where are the rules on imports   that haven't been released yet?\\" The FDA says about 15 percent of food eaten by Americans is imported, and that share is growing. Rules have not been released yet to require imported foods to meet the same standards as food produced in the United States.

They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council.  - Operation \\"Varsity\\" (24 March 1945) was a successful airborne forces operation launched by Allied troops that took place toward the end of World War II. Involving more than 16,000 paratroopers and several thousand aircraft, it was the largest airborne operation in history to be conducted on a single day and in one location.  - George J. Peters ( 1924 -- March 24 , 1945 ) was a soldier of the United States Army and a recipient of the highest decoration of the United States Armed Forces -- the Medal of Honor -- for his actions in the final stages of World War II during Operation Varsity .  - The Continental Army was formed by the Second Continental Congress after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War by the colonies that became the United States of America. Established by a resolution of the Congress on June 14, 1775, it was created to coordinate the military efforts of the Thirteen Colonies in their revolt against the rule of Great Britain. The Continental Army was supplemented by local militias and troops that remained under control of the individual states or were otherwise independent. General George Washington was the commander-in-chief of the army throughout the war.  - The United States of America has seven federal uniformed services that commission officers as defined by Title 10, and subsequently structured and organized by Title 10, Title 14, Title 32 and Title 42 of the United States Code.  - The Second Barbary War (18151816), was the second of two wars fought between the United States and the North African Barbary states of Tripoli, Tunis, and Algeria. The war between the Barbary states and the U.S. ended when \\"the U.S. Senate ratified Decaturs Algerian treaty on December 5, 1815\\". However, Dey Omar Agha, the ruler of Algeria, repudiated the US treaty, refused to accept the terms of peace that had been ratified by the Congress of Vienna, and threatened the lives of all Christian inhabitants of Algiers. William Shaler, the US commissioner who had negotiated alongside Decatur, had to flee aboard British vessels and later watched \\"shells and rockets fly over [his] house like hail\\" as a result of the subsequent Bombardment of Algiers (1816). Shaler then negotiated a new treaty after the Bombardment of Algiers in 1816, which was not ratified by the Senate until February 11, 1822, owing to an accidental oversight.  - The National Security Act of 1947 was a major restructuring of the United States government's military and intelligence agencies following World War II. The majority of the provisions of the Act took effect on September 18, 1947, the day after the Senate confirmed James Forrestal as the first Secretary of Defense.  - The Army of the United States or Armies of the United States is the legal name of the \\"land forces of the United States\\" (United States Constitution, Article 2, Section 2, Clause 1 and United States Code, Title 10, Subtitle B, Chapter 301, Section 3001) and has been used in this context since at least 1841, as in the title: \\"General Regulations for the Army of the United States\\". The Army, or Armies of the United States includes: the Regular Army, Army National Guard, and the Army Reserve, (as well as any volunteer or conscripted forces).   - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany.  - The Code of Laws of the United States of America (variously abbreviated to Code of Laws of the United States, United States Code, U.S. Code, or U.S.C.) is the official compilation and codification of the general and permanent federal statutes of the United States. It contains 52 titles, and a further three titles have been proposed. The main edition is published every six years by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel of the House of Representatives, and cumulative supplements are published annually. The official version of those laws not codified in the United States Code can be found in United States Statutes at Large.  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - The American Civil War was a civil war in the United States fought from 1861 to 1865. The Union faced secessionists in eleven Southern states grouped together as the Confederate States of America. The Union won the war, which remains the bloodiest in U.S. history.  - The date of the start of the history of the United States is a subject of debate among historians. Older textbooks start with the arrival of Christopher Columbus on October 12, 1492 and emphasize the European background, or they start around 1600 and emphasize the American frontier. In recent decades American schools and universities typically have shifted back in time to include more on the colonial period and much more on the prehistory of the Native peoples.  - The Congress of the Confederation, or the Confederation Congress, formally referred to as the United States in Congress Assembled, was the governing body of the United States of America that existed from March 1, 1781, to March 4, 1789. It comprised delegates appointed by the legislatures or assemblies of the several states. It was preceded by the Second Continental Congress (17751781) and governed under the newly adopted \\"Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union\\", which were proposed 17761777, adopted by the Continental Congress in July 1778 and finally agreed to by a unanimous vote of all thirteen states by 1781, held up by a long dispute over the cession of western territories beyond the Appalachian Mountains to the central government led by Maryland and a coalition of smaller states without western claims. The newly reorganized Congress at the time continued to refer itself as the Continental Congress throughout its eight-year history, although modern historians separate it from the earlier bodies, which operated under slightly different rules and procedures until the later part of American Revolutionary War. The membership of the Second Continental Congress automatically carried over to the Congress of the Confederation when the latter was created by the ratification of the Articles of Confederation. It had the same secretary as the Second Continental Congress, namely Charles Thomson. The Congress of the Confederation was succeeded by the Congress of the United States as provided for in the Constitution of the United States, proposed September 17, 1787, in Philadelphia and ratified by the states through 1787 to 1788 and even into 1789 and 1790.  - The United States Army (USA) is the largest branch of the United States Armed Forces and performs land-based military operations. It is one of the seven uniformed services of the United States and is designated as the Army of the United States in the United States Constitution, Article 2, Section 2, Clause 1 and United States Code, Title 10, Subtitle B, Chapter 301, Section 3001. As the largest and senior branch of the U.S. military, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (17751783)before the U.S. was established as a country. After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784, to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army, and dates its institutional inception from the origin of that armed force in 1775.  - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II.  - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history.  - The Cold War was a state of political and military tension after World War II between powers in the Eastern Bloc (the Soviet Union and its satellite states) and powers in the Western Bloc (the United States, its NATO allies and others). Historians do not fully agree on the dates, but a common timeframe is the period (the second half of the 20th century) between 1947, the year the Truman Doctrine (a U.S. policy pledging to aid nations threatened by Soviet expansionism) was announced, and 1991, the year the Soviet Union collapsed.  - The First Barbary War (18011805), also known as the Tripolitanian War and the Barbary Coast War, was the first of two Barbary Wars between the United States, Sweden and the four North African states known collectively as the \\"Barbary States\\". Three of these were nominal provinces of the Ottoman Empire, but in practice autonomous: Tripoli, Algiers, and Tunis. The fourth was the independent Sultanate of Morocco. The cause of the war was pirates from the Barbary States seizing American merchant ships and holding the crews for ransom, demanding the U.S. pay tribute to the Barbary rulers. United States President Thomas Jefferson refused to pay this tribute, in addition the Swedes had been at war with the Tripolitans since 1800.

Let's break down the sentence's key components to better understand the sentiment behind it. 1. \\"few films have captured the chaos of an urban conflagration with such fury\\": This statement expresses a positive sentiment, as it praises the film for effectively capturing the chaos and fury of intense city-based action. By using \\"few films,\\" the reviewer implies that this film stands out among others in this aspect, making its execution exceptional. 2. \\"audience members will leave feeling as shaken as Nesbitt's Cooper looks when the bullets stop flying\\": This statement contains somewhat mixed sentiments. On the one hand, it demonstrates that the film has a potent emotional impact on audience members, leaving them feeling shaken. This suggests that the film effectively immerses viewers in the experience and elicits a strong emotional reaction, which can be seen as positive. However, the negative aspect here is that this reaction may be discomfort, unease, or distress, which might be unpleasant for some viewers. Overall, it can be concluded that the sentiment of the movie review sentence is largely positive, with a minor underlying negative aspect. The review praises the film's ability to capture chaos and fury in a way that sets it apart from other films, while also acknowledging that this intense experience may be emotionally taxing on the audience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Problem:The rail infrastructure owner, which has estimated its project could cost £2.8bn, is carrying out the work on the Great Western railway line. It was originally due to be finished by 2018, with most diesel trains replaced. However, some routes due to be completed before then will not be ready until 2020, resulting in new trains sitting in sidings. Under the original plan Reading to Didcot should have already been completed, with Oxford and Bristol next in 2016. But because work has fallen behind, Didcot is expected to be two years late in 2017, and Newbury and Oxford three years late in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Bristol Temple Meads will not see electric trains until 2020, and the East West rail link from Oxford to Bletchley is delayed until the early 2020s.

What is the best way to: How do I scrub a stain out of my carpet?","output":"Absolutely, let me explain it in a simple way: You know how sometimes you accidentally spill some juice or color on your favorite drawing paper and it creates a stain? The same thing can happen with our carpets. 1. First, tell an adult about the spill straight away. Speedy action can help remove the stain better and faster. 2. Like your toys, different carpets need different care. It's better for grown-ups to check what kind of care a carpet needs before using any cleaning stuff on it. 3. Materials needed to help clean the stains are a white cloth or a sponge, warm water, a little dish soap or vinegar, and a small bowl. 4. The grown-up can put some warm water in a bowl. Then, add few drops of dish soap or vinegar into it. Stir it a little till it mixes well. 5. Dip the white cloth or sponge into the soapy water or vinegar water - remember, just a little, it doesn't need to be soaking wet. 6. Then, they can gently rub on the stain with the cloth or sponge, the same way you gently color inside the lines, not too hard. 7. Once the stain starts disappearing, the adult will use another part of a clean, dry cloth to blot or tap on the wet area to dry it. 8. It is important to remember to always be gentle when cleaning a carpet, like you are with your teddy bear, so we don't harm it. Remember, it's always best to involve a grown-up when we clean something, especially when we want to remove a stain from a carpet.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>. The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether The Tail is the intention of the PersonX from the Head or not. The intention is the likely intent or desire of PersonX behind the execution of an event. For example, given the Head PersonX gives PersonY gifts, an intention might be that PersonX wanted to be thoughtful. Classify your answers into \\"Yes\\" and \\"No\\". The phrase may also contain \\"___\\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action. Q: Head: PersonX accepts the offer<sep>Tail: excited A:","output":"The task is asking you to analyze two separate but related phrases or events. The first event, referred to as the 'Head', will involve a character named PersonX doing something or reacting in some way. The second event, referred to as the 'Tail', will suggest a potential intention or emotional state of PersonX.  Your job is to decide whether the 'Tail' event can be seen as the intended outcome or emotional state of the PersonX based on the 'Head' event. To clarify this with an example, if we have the phrase: Head: PersonX gives PersonY a gift<sep>Tail: PersonX wants to make PersonY happy. In this scenario, your task is to decide if giving a gift (the 'Head') is genuinely intended to make PersonY happy (the 'Tail').  There are some additional rules to bear in mind. Sometimes, there might be a placeholder '___' in the events. This could represent an object, a person, or even an action that isn't directly specified, and you'll have to infer based on the information provided. Also, you'll need to give responses as either 'Yes' or 'No'.  Now let's look at the given example: Head: PersonX accepts the offer<sep>Tail: excited. In this specific case, the question is asking if PersonX is excited because they accepted the offer. You need to consider whether accepting the offer would logically result in PersonX becoming excited. If you believe this fits, you would answer \\"Yes\\". If not, your answer would be \\"No\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Former world number one Rafael Nadal will end a six-month absence from tennis when he competes in an Abu Dhabi exhibition tournament later this month, the Spaniard has revealed. Nadal has been sidelined by knee problems following June's shock second-round exit at Wimbledon to 100th-ranked Czech Lukas Rosol. \\"Can't wait to get back on court in Abu Dhabi at the end of the month,\\" he wrote on his Twitter and Facebook pages. \\"I won the Mubadala World Tennis Championship in 2010 and 2011 -- would love to get my hands on the trophy again this year.\\" After his Wimbledon exit, the 11-time grand slam champion was diagnosed with Hoffa's syndrome, an inflammation of the fatty tissue in his left knee that has sidelined him on numerous occasions over the years. The injury meant Nadal was unable to defend his Olympic title at London 2012, with the 26-year-old dropping to fourth in the rankings after also missing out on the U.S. Open and Spain's Davis Cup final defeat to the Czech Republic in November. Having started training again late last month, Nadal will make his return in Abu Dhabi on December 28, 17 days before the first grand slam of 2013 -- the Australian Open in Melbourne. Earlier this month, he said it would be difficult to win the Australian Open after such a lengthy period off court, warning fans not to expect \\"miracles.\\" Nadal has a first-round bye in Abu Dhabi, then plays the winner of the match between U.S. Open and Olympic champion Andy Murray and ninth-ranked Serbian Janko Tipsarevic. World No. 1 Novak Djokovic will also line up in the six-man, three-day event. He will play either world No. 5 David Ferrer or Czech Davis Cup winner Tomas Berdych on the second day. Meanwhile, the International Tennis Federation has named Djokovic and third-ranked woman Serena Williams as its 2012 world champions. Djokovic received the honor for the second year running, as the Serbian retained the Australian Open and won the season-ending ATP championship but suffered the disappointment of losing the final at both Roland Garros and Flushing Meadows. \\"I am proud to have been named ITF World Champion for the second successive year,\\" said the 25-year-old. \\"It was very difficult to follow up such a successful season in 2011, but it was extremely satisfying to win another grand slam title, reach two other major finals and finish the year at No. 1.\\" Meanwhile, Williams was in vintage form in 2012 as the 31-year-old tasted Olympic singles gold for the first time in addition to taking her grand slam collection to 15 titles, following this year's triumphs at both Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. \\"It means a lot to be named ITF World Champion for the third time,\\" said Williams, who finished the season with a WTA Tour-best seven titles. \\"It has been such an amazing experience this year to win the Olympics and two grand slam tournaments, and I look forward to having an awesome 2013.\\" It is the second year in a row that the top-ranked woman has missed out on the ITF award -- last year Petra Kvitova headed off Caroline Wozniacki. This time Victoria Azarenka missed out despite leading the earnings list with more than 7 million in prize money and winning her first grand slam in Melbourne. The ITF World Champions will receive their awards at a dinner during the French Open in Paris next June.

However, there is no mention of a man reading a newspaper on a bench. We cannot conclude that \\"A man reads a newspaper on a bench\\" based on the initial statement, as there is no apparent connection or evidence supporting this second scenario's occurrence. The two situations are distinct, and, without any provided context linking them, they must be treated as separate occurrences - they could be happening simultaneously or at completely unrelated times, for example. Even if these events take place simultaneously at the same location, it still requires a leap of logic to directly connect the two scenarios simply because there is no clear relationship between them. The presence of the woman in yellow and the yellow car may indeed be taking place in the same vicinity as the man reading the newspaper, but there is no reason to deduce that one situation necessarily implies the existence of the other. In conclusion, while the two situations could potentially coexist, the initial statement does not offer enough information to substantiate the existence of \\"A man reads a newspaper on a bench.\\" These distinct events, it seems, do not have sufficient connection to allow one to confidently or logically confirm the presence of one based on the occurrence of the other."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Kate leaves a note in the mailbox for the next tenant to forward her letters should some slip through the system, further adding that the paint-embedded pawprints on the walkway leading into the house were already there when she arrived. Two years earlier in 2004, Alex Wyler (Reeves), an architect, arrives at the lake house and finds Kate's letter in the mailbox. The house is neglected, with no sign of paw prints anywhere. During the house's restoration, a dog runs through Alex's paint and leaves fresh paw prints right where Kate said they would be. Baffled, Alex writes back, asking how Kate knew about the paw prints since the house was unoccupied until he arrived. On Valentine's Day 2006, Kate witnesses a traffic accident near Daley Plaza and tries to save the male victim, unsuccessfully. She impulsively drives back to the lake house, finds Alex's letter and writes back. Both Alex and Kate continue passing messages to each other via the mailbox, and each watches its flag go up and down as the message leaves and the reply arrives as they wait at the mailbox. They cautiously look around each time the flag changes, hoping to somehow spot the other. It is in vain as they are alone at the mailbox. They then discover that they are living exactly two years apart. Their correspondence takes them through several events, including Alex finding a book, Persuasion, at a train station where Kate said she had lost it, and Alex taking Kate on a walking tour of his favorite places in Chicago via an annotated map that he leaves in the mailbox.

In the study, women who were new mothers scored better on tests of visuospatial memory - the ability to understand and remember information about their surroundings--compared with women who didn't have children. The findings contradicts the old belief that women develop\\"baby brain\\" or a decline in memory and cognitive  function, after they have kids, said study researcher Melissa Santiago, a doctoral student at Carlos Albizu University in Miami. \\"You don't have to feel that because you have kids, your memory isn't the same,\\" Santiago said. The study was small, and the findings will have to be tested in larger groups of people, Santiago said. Previous studies on the topic have had mixed results--some showed motherhood hurts cognition, and others showed the opposite. Studies on rats show those with pups have better memory than those without offspring. Santiago analyzed information from 35 first-time mothers whose children were ages 10 to 24 months, and 35 women who had never been pregnant. Both groups scored similarly on intelligence tests. The average age of mothers was 29 and the average age of never-pregnant women was 27. To test visuospatial memory, the women were shown a paper containing six symbols for 10 seconds, and then asked to draw what they remembered. This task was repeated several times. The first time women were shown the paper, both groups remembered about the same amount. But on the second and third pass, mothers performed better than those without children, indicating that the mothers collected more information each time than the other women. Later, the women were shown a variety of different symbols, and asked to remember which ones were presented on the earlier task. Mothers did not make a mistake in this task--they remembered every symbol correctly--but those without children made one or two errors, Santiago said. Question: It can be inferred that Santiago believe the findings of the study  _  .

U.S. President Donald Trump says he is considering tariffs, quotas, and retaliatory taxes on imports of steel and aluminum from countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea. The comments came during a wide-ranging trade discussion Tuesday between Trump and a bipartisan group of lawmakers at the White House.  The president said U.S. steel and aluminum industries are being \\"decimated\\" by the \\"dumping\\" of cheap imports of those materials into U.S. markets. Trump has long threatened what he calls \\"reciprocal\\" trade action to deal with steel, aluminum, and other imports.  But he has so far avoided taking any major steps, ostensibly out of fear of hurting the country's strong economic performance since he took office.  Several lawmakers on Tuesday urged Trump to be cautious when considering retaliatory trade steps, saying such measures could spark a trade war that leads to higher prices for U.S. producers and consumers.  \\"It's very, very much a double-edged sword,\\" Trump conceded.  \\"I want to keep prices down, but I also want to make sure that we have a steel industry and an aluminum industry,\\" he added.  The Trump administration is currently renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as well as the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement with South Korea.  Trump called the U.S.-South Korea deal \\"very, very bad\\" and \\"horrible.\\" He also said Canada has \\"treated us very, very unfairly.\\"  Last month, the U.S. Commerce Department sent a so-called \\"232 report\\" to the White House, examining the national security impacts of steel and aluminum imports, and giving Trump 90 days to impose quotas or tariffs.

It was produced by Harvey Levin Productions, and directed by Brad Kreisburg. It was hosted by Holly Herbert and Carlos Diaz.   - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows:  European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity.  - The Daytime Emmy Award is an American accolade bestowed by the New Yorkbased National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences in recognition of excellence in American daytime television programming. Ceremonies generally are held in May or June.  - As the World Turns (often referred to as ATWT) is an American television soap opera that aired on CBS for 54 years from April 2, 1956, to September 17, 2010.

Which student read more about animals carrying out lactic acid fermentation?  Two students had to study fermentation processes for a school project. Ned studied lactic fermentation, while Kat studied alcoholic fermentation.  Hint: Animals and some bacteria and fungi carry out lactic acid fermentation. Lactic acid is a waste product of this process. Our muscles perform lactic acid fermentation during strenuous exercise, since oxygen cannot be delivered to the muscles quickly enough. The buildup of lactic acid is believed to make your muscles sore after exercise. Bacteria that produce lactic acid are used to make cheese and yogurt. The lactic acid causes the proteins in milk to thicken. Lactic acid also causes tooth decay, because bacteria use the sugars in your mouth for energy.

Translate this to English?","output":"\\"Les Amusements Wiltron Inc. c.\\" seems to be a French language phrase, but it appears to be a corporate name or a business name. Generally, a company's name doesn't get translated as it's a registered name and therefore used as it is regardless of language. If we would break down the phrase, here is what it would mean in English: 1. \\"Les\\" - This is a French definite article that means \\"The\\" in English. 2. \\"Amusements\\" - This is the same in English and retains its meaning of \\"amusements,\\" indicating some form of entertainment. 3. \\"Wiltron\\" - This appears to be a proper noun, possibly a family or corporate name. It would keep its form in English. 4. \\"Inc.\\" - This is an abbreviation of \\"Incorporated,\\" a term used in business names to indicate a company that is legally recognized as a single entity, separate from its owners.

Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study.  - A Midsummer Night's Dream is a comedy written by William Shakespeare in 1595/96. It portrays the events surrounding the marriage of Theseus, the Duke of Athens, to Hippolyta. These include the adventures of four young Athenian lovers and a group of six amateur actors (the mechanicals) who are controlled and manipulated by the fairies who inhabit the forest in which most of the play is set. The play is one of Shakespeare's most popular works for the stage and is widely performed across the world.  - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.  - Discworld is a comic fantasy book series written by the English author Terry Pratchett (19482015), set on the fictional Discworld, a flat disc balanced on the backs of four elephants which in turn stand on the back of a giant turtle, Great A'Tuin. The books frequently parody or take inspiration from J. R. R. Tolkien, Robert E. Howard, H. P. Lovecraft, Charles Dickens, and William Shakespeare, as well as mythology, folklore and fairy tales, often using them for satirical parallels with current cultural, political and scientific issues. The series is popular, with more than 80 million books sold in 37 languages.  - William Shakespeare (26 April 1564 (baptised)  23 April 1616) was an English :poet, :playwright, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England's national poet, and the \\"Bard of Avon\\". His extant works, including collaborations, consist of approximately 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.  - Robert Ervin Howard (January 22, 1906  June 11, 1936) was an American author who wrote pulp fiction in a diverse range of genres. He is well known for his character Conan the Barbarian and is regarded as the father of the sword and sorcery subgenre.  - In Classical Greek mythology, Hippolyta (\\"Hippolyte\\") was the Amazonian queen who possessed a magical girdle she was given by her father Ares, the god of war. The girdle was a waist belt that signified her authority as queen of the Amazons. She figures prominently in the myths of both Heracles and Theseus. As such, the myths about her are varied enough that they may be about several different women.  - The Carpet People is a fantasy novel by British writer Terry Pratchett. It was originally published in 1971, but was later re-written by the author when his work became more widespread and well-known. In the Author's Note of the revised edition, published in 1992, Pratchett wrote: \\"This book had two authors, and they were both the same person.\\"  - Sir Terence David John \\"Terry\\" Pratchett, OBE (28 April 1948  12 March 2015) was an English author of fantasy novels, especially comical works. He is best known for his Discworld series of 41 novels. Pratchett's first novel, \\"The Carpet People\\", was published in 1971. The first Discworld novel, \\"The Colour of Magic\\", was published in 1983, after which he wrote two books a year on average. His 2011 Discworld novel \\"Snuff\\" was at the time of its release the third-fastest-selling hardback adult-readership novel since records began in the UK, selling 55,000 copies in the first three days. His final Discworld novel, \\"The Shepherd's Crown\\", was published in August 2015, five months after his death.  - The Colour of Magic is a 1983 comic fantasy novel by Terry Pratchett, and is the first book of the \\"Discworld\\" series. The first printing of the British edition consisted of 506 copies. Pratchett has described it as \\"an attempt to do for the classical fantasy universe what \\"Blazing Saddles\\" did for Westerns.\\"  - Lords and Ladies is the fourteenth Discworld book by Terry Pratchett . It was originally published in 1992 . Much of the storyline spoofs elements of Shakespeare 's play A Midsummer Night 's Dream .  - A fairy tale is a type of short story that typically features folkloric fantasy characters, such as dwarves, elves, fairies, giants, gnomes, goblins, mermaids, trolls, unicorns, or witches, and usually magic or enchantments. Fairy tales may be distinguished from other folk narratives such as legends (which generally involve belief in the veracity of the events described) and explicitly moral tales, including beast fables. The term is mainly used for stories with origins in European tradition and, at least in recent centuries, mostly relates to children's literature.  - Mythology refers variously to the collected myths of a group of people or to the study of such myths. Myths are the stories people tell to explain nature, history and customs.  - Folklore is the body of expressive culture shared by a particular group of people; it encompasses the traditions common to that culture, subculture or group. These include oral traditions such as tales, proverbs and jokes. They include material culture, ranging from traditional building styles to handmade toys common to the group. Folklore also includes customary lore, the forms and rituals of celebrations like Christmas and weddings, folk dances and initiation rites. Each one of these, either singly or in combination, is considered a folklore artifact. Just as essential as the form, folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts from one region to another or from one generation to the next. For folklore is not taught in a formal school curriculum or studied in the fine arts. Instead these traditions are passed along informally from one individual to another either through verbal instruction or demonstration. The academic study of folklore is called folkloristics.  - Howard Phillips Lovecraft (August 20, 1890  March 15, 1937) was an American author who achieved posthumous fame through his influential works of horror fiction. Virtually unknown and published only in pulp magazines before he died in poverty, he is now regarded as one of the most significant 20th-century authors in his genre. Lovecraft was born in Providence, Rhode Island, where he spent most of his life. Among his most celebrated tales are \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\" and \\"The Shadow over Innsmouth\\", both canonical to the \\"Cthulhu Mythos\\". Never able to support himself from earnings as author and editor, Lovecraft saw commercial success increasingly elude him in this latter period, partly because he lacked the confidence and drive to promote himself. He subsisted in progressively straitened circumstances in his last years; an inheritance was completely spent by the time he died at the age of 46.  - John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, (3 January 1892  2 September 1973), known by his pen name J. R. R. Tolkien, was an English writer, poet, philologist, and university professor who is best known as the author of the classic high-fantasy works \\"The Hobbit\\", \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", and \\"The Silmarillion\\".  - Charles John Huffam Dickens (7 February 1812  9 June 1870) was an English writer and social critic. He created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era. His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime, and by the twentieth century critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius. His novels and short stories enjoy lasting popularity.    Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'main subject'.

Answer: Answer:","output":"Based on the given review, it is not explicitly clear whether the user would recommend the product or not, as they do not specifically state their overall opinion about it. However, we can analyze the provided information and make an educated guess. The user mentions that \\"it's just another game of bingo\\" and \\"nothing too exciting.\\" From this, we can infer that the user likely does not find the product to be exceptional, unique, or particularly engaging. This suggests that the user may not be extremely enthusiastic about recommending the product to others. On the other hand, the user also mentions that their 4-year-old is \\"getting the point of how to play.\\" This implies that the user sees at least some educational or developmental value in the product, as it is helping their child understand and engage with the game. Consequently, the user might recommend the product to others whose children are around the same age, or who are interested in similar educational games. Taking these factors into account, our best guess is that the user's recommendation would be somewhat neutral or ambivalent.

Step 5: Infer the relation between storage temperature and cooking time Since freshness is being maintained under 40 degrees, it is unlikely that the food will be inclined to cook at that temperature. Cooking typically requires higher temperatures to denature proteins, kill bacteria, and change the food's texture and taste. Step 6: Formulate the answer Answer: No, the right answer to the question, \\"what happens when food is stored below 40 degrees?\\" is not \\"it gets cooked quicker.\\" Instead, storing food below 40 degrees helps keep it fresh by slowing down bacterial growth and preserving its quality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A third person died Friday from an explosion at a rocket test pad operated by a private company in California's southern Mojave Desert, according to the nursing supervisor at Kern Medical Center in Bakersfield. A bird's eye view of the scene in Mojave, California, shows charred wreckage and large pieces of debris. The explosion, which occurred Thursday at the Mojave Air and Space Port in Mojave, California, initially killed two people and critically injured four others. On Friday three people remained hospitalized -- two in critical condition, one in serious condition. The six were employed by Scaled Composites, an aerospace development company founded 25 years ago by Burt Rutan, the aerospace engineer who designed the first plane to fly nonstop around the world without refueling. According to Rutan, the blast occurred during a test involving nitrous oxide flowing through fuel injectors. A source said the workers were testing components of a new rocket motor for SpaceShipTwo, which is a spaceship being built for Virgin Galactic, Richard Branson's space tourism company. \\"We were doing a test that we believed was completely safe. ... We don't know why it exploded,\\" said Rutan, who was not at the site at the time of the accident.  Watch the aftermath of the explosion ». The explosion happened during a \\"cold fire test,\\" he said. A spokeswoman for the space port, which is about 80 miles north of Los Angeles, said the blast was on a remote pad and that the area had been contained. Aerial video of the blast aftermath showed a charred and twisted flatbed trailer attached to a truck cab with a large silver tank next to it. Large pieces of debris appeared to be strewn for hundreds of yards from the center. Rutan won the Ansari X-Prize in 2004 for the first repeat sub-orbital space flight with his pioneering SpaceShipOne. SpaceShipTwo is a small carbon fiber craft designed to carry seven passengers up to 65 miles above the earth, traveling at a speed of about 12,000 mph.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Parents everywhere praise their kids when they do well in school, win a ball game, or build an impressive sandcastle --- anytime their kids do something remarkable  , or in many cases, something ordinary. \\"We are becoming praise junkies as parents\\", says Jenn Berman, PhD, a marriage and family expert and the author of The A to Z Guide to Raising Happy and Confident Kids. \\"We have gone to the opposite extreme   of the parents from a few decades ago who tended to be more strict, and now we overpraise our children.\\" \\"Somehow parents have come to believe that by praising our kids we improve their self-esteem  ,\\" says Paul Donahue, founder and director of Child Development Associates. \\"Though well-intentioned, putting kids on a pedestal   at an early age can actually hinder   their growth.\\" Too much praise can backfire  , it seems, and when given in a way that's insincere, kids are afraid to try new things or take a risk for fear of not being on the top all the time. \\"There's an underlying   message that the child has to get his parents' approval all the time and constantly depends on the parents for validation  ,\\" says Berman. Still, don't go too far in the other direction --- not giving enough praise which can be just as damaging as giving too much. Kids will feel like they are not good enough, or that you don't care, and may see no sense in reaching for their success. So what's the right amount of praise? Experts say that the quality of praise is more important than the quantity: if praise is sincere and genuine, and focused on the effort, not the outcome, you can give it as often as your child does something that is worth a reward. Options: A Those who praise their children too much. B Those who seldom praise their children. C Those who give sincere praise to their children. D Those who offer their children dangerous drugs.

Given the question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I’ve learnt a great amount throughout this studio, first and foremost I was taught: how the art world functions, how specific galleries such as Gertrude St Contemporary run and how artists earn a living. The studio also provided me with basic filmmaking skills such as how to: create a shooting schedule, write a shooting script, set up three-point lighting, conduct an interview, utilise visual storytelling and edit a short film. Throughout the shooting process with my artist I also developed my abilities regarding how to use a: Sony Zoom H2N (and other such handy recorders), a lapel mic, my own Canon EOS 60D and Adobe Premiere Pro editing software. Overall I think the studio functioned quite successfully, it was great to be in a studio with nineteen people who all were interested in the same topics as you. I felt that overall, the studios had a very happy and supportive environment, and you walked away knowing a great deal about the art world and how to make short documentaries. The project itself taught me a great deal about how to work with talent, as well as my group members. Having to work independently forced me to be completely all over every aspect of the shoot, whether that be choosing which questions to ask, deciding what to focus on, where I wanted the shoot to happen, deciding what gear to use, getting to the shoot, carrying all the gear, what I wanted to shoot, managing the audio, managing the lighting, managing the camera set-ups, managing the talent, editing the film, and finding a great soundtrack for it. I’m a pretty self-conscious person and I often doubt the decisions I make or ask someone else for their opinion (should I shoot this angle, or what do you think of this question etc.). Working independently pushed me to go with my gut instincts, to make decisions and to not seek others approval. It forced me to develop my aesthetic as a filmmaker and to own the work that I ended up producing, so ultimately I was really glad with how everything panned out. Question: Why was the narrator self-conscience? Options:  A. not enough information  B. Because he was tird  C. Because he was overwhelmed  D.

A shortage of officers, following the capture of most of the professional French army at the Siege of Metz and at the Battle of Sedan, led naval officers to be sent from their ships to command hastily assembled reservists of the Garde Mobile. As the autumn storms of the North Sea forced the return of more of the French ships, the blockade of the north German ports diminished and in September 1870 the French navy abandoned the blockade for the winter.

Given the following passage  \\"In 1931, RCA Victor introduced their vinyl-based Victrolac compound as a material for some unusual-format and special-purpose records. By the end of the 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications. When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s, at a de luxe price. Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce \\"unbreakable\\" children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.\\",  answer the following question.

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person Matthew becomes smitten with? , can you please find it?   A 11-year-old orphan, Anne Shirley, is living in servitude with the cruel Hammond family in Nova Scotia. However, when Mr. Hammond dies, Anne is sent to an orphanage where she eventually receives the wonderful news that she has been adopted by a couple on Prince Edward Island. Upon arriving in P.E.I, Anne is met at the train station by an elderly Matthew Cuthbert who is surprised to find a girl there instead of a boy. Matthew and his sister Marilla had requested a boy to help them with the farm chores. He decides that he couldn't very well just leave the girl at the train station. Matthew takes Anne to meet Marilla, and on the buggy ride home, becomes completely smitten with the red-haired orphan girl. When Anne Shirley arrives at the Cuthberts' farm, called \\"Green Gables\\", she is a precocious, romantic child desperate to be loved and highly sensitive about her red hair and homely looks. In her own unique headstrong manner, Anne manages to insult the town gossip, Rachel Lynde, in a dispute over her looks; smash her slate over Gilbert Blythe's head when he calls her \\"Carrots\\" on her first day of school; and accidentally dyes her hair green in an effort to turn her red hair black and salvage her wounded pride. Marilla Cuthbert is shocked and beside herself to know how she will ever cope with this sensitive, headstrong child so desperate to fit in. But shy, gentle Matthew is always there to defend Anne and hold her up on a pedestal. It seems like Anne is destined to cultivate disaster. She becomes \\"bosom\\" friends with Diana Barry from across the pond and succeeds in getting Diana drunk by accidentally serving currant wine instead of raspberry cordial at a tea party. Diana's mother and Rachel Lynde turn on Marilla for making wine in the first place. Anne moves from one mishap to the next as her wild imagination and far-fetched antics combine to constantly land her in trouble. The answer is:","output":"Matthew becomes smitten with Anne Shirley."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death.  I am facing a new situation today: Jake and his son Ryan just had their yearly physical examination by the doctor. As part of this year's examination, both men had their arterial walls examined to identify the presence of plaques. The doctor discovered that Jake had a high amount of plaques present on the interior of his arterial wall. Ryan, on the other hand, had no plaques present.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Who is less likely to have lowered oxygen supply to their heart muscles? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation with Jake and Ryan, it is clear that Ryan is less likely to have a lowered oxygen supply to his heart muscles compared to Jake. This conclusion can be reached by analyzing the factors that contribute to lowered oxygen supply and how they relate to the presence of arterial plaques, as described in the article. Atherosclerosis, as mentioned in the article, is a disorder in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. Over time, these deposits lead to the formation of plaques, which in turn can restrict or even block the flow of blood through the blood vessels. A decrease in blood flow can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. In severe cases, a complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart can result in a heart attack, causing significant damage due to oxygen deprivation and possibly even leading to death. In the new situation with Jake and Ryan, the doctor found that Jake had a high amount of plaques on the interior of his arterial wall, while Ryan had none. Therefore, considering the presence of plaques as a significant factor in blood flow restriction and subsequently, lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle, Ryan is less likely to face this issue compared to his father. It is important to note that the presence of plaques is not the sole determinant of a person's risk of heart disease or lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscles. Factors such as age, genetics, diet, physical activity levels, and overall health also play a role in determining an individual's risk of developing heart disease or experiencing oxygen deprivation in the heart muscles. However, in this specific scenario, the absence of plaques in Ryan's arterial walls indicates a lower likelihood of restricted blood flow and, consequently, a lower risk of lowered oxygen supply to his heart muscles compared to Jake."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The mild-mannered Harold Diddlebock is promptly hired by the pompous advertising tycoon J.E. Waggleberry (Raymond Walburn) to work at his firm. Harold is given a low-paying job at the firm's bookeeper.Jumping forward 22 years to 1945, Harold (still working in his boring job as bookkeeper) is promptly let go by Waggleberry with nothing but a tiny pension of around 1,000. Harold bids farewell to the girl at the desk down the aisle, Miss Otis (Frances Ramsden), whom he had hoped to marry just as he had hoped to marry five of her older sisters before whom also worked at the firm.As Harold wanders aimlessly through the streets, his life's savings in hand, he has a run-in with an older man; a slimy racetrack tout named Wormy (Jimmy Conlin) and finds himself in a bar. When he tells the bartender (Edgar Kennedy) that he's never had a drink in his life, the barkeep creates a potent cocktail he calls \\"The Diddlebock\\", one sip of which is enough to release Harold from all his inhibitions, setting him off on a day-and-a-half binge of spending and carousing. Harold then goes to a tailor and barber shop and spends most of his money and bets the rest on a horserace and wins.Some days later, Harold wakes up on the couch in the house of his widowed older sister Flora (Margaret Hamilton). He finds that he has a hangover, but he also has a garish new wardrobe, a ten-gallon hat, a hansom horse-drawn cab complete with a driver, and ownership of a bankrupt circus.Trying to sell the circus, Harold and Wormy visit circus-loving Wall Street banker Lynn Sargent (Rudy Vallee), and then, when he turns them down, so do the rest of the town's bankers.

Answer:","output":"The last step in the process of sediment transportation and deposition is sedimentation. During sedimentation, the sediments, which were transported by the river and deposited in lakes and oceans, gradually settle down to the bottom due to gravity and decreasing water flow speed.

Expand this summary.","output":"In an upcoming Sunday column in the Washington Post, conservative commentator George Will criticizes presumptive Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney as a \\"recidivist reviser of his principles\\" who could hinder the GOP's chances of capturing the Senate. Will's critique of Romney, revealed early by Politico's Playbook, compares the Republican politician to the \\"technocratic\\" former Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis. Will also questions if conservatism has advanced far enough to resolve the ongoing economic crisis by settling for a candidate like Romney. This criticism comes from an influential and respected voice among conservatives, which might signal dissatisfaction with Romney from the Republican establishment. While many on the right believe the party can find a better candidate, it is important to note that Will is one of the most prominent conservative voices to express this opinion explicitly. Jonathan Chait at Daily Intel further discusses the lukewarm response Romney has received from conservatives, implying potential challenges for his campaign and the Republican Party’s broader goals in the upcoming election. As George Will's influential voice highlights conservatives' discontent with Mitt Romney's presidential candidacy, it raises doubts about whether Romney is the best candidate to address the country's economic crisis and if his nomination could damage GOP chances of capturing the Senate. The comparison to Michael Dukakis emphasizes Will's view of Romney as a politician who revises his principles and leans towards technocratic solutions rather than embodying the true spirit of conservatism. This critique, coming from an established figure in conservative circles, might suggest a significant challenge for Romney's campaign and the overall direction of the Republican Party."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The 23-year-old Briton teams up with Kamui Kobayashi for the season-ending double pointer for which cash-strapped Caterham announced they would race a week ago after going into administration last month. Earlier this month, Caterham launched a crowd-funding project in a bid to raise the £2.35million needed to get the team on the grid for the final race of the season. Administrators Smith & Williamson announced last Friday that they were just under £500,000 short and that they would race at the Yas Marina. British racer Will Stevens will make his debut for Caterham at the season finale in Abu Dhabi this weekend. Stevens, 23, was part of the Caterham Academy and has tested for the F1 team, pictured here in 2013. Stevens was part of the Caterham Racing Academy and has been involved in Formula One testing for the Leafield-based marque in 2013 and this year, clocking up 1,100kilometres in the process and gaining his FIA Super licence. He is delighted to be given the chance at Caterham for the final race on the 2014 calendar and said: 'I'm absolutely thrilled to be getting this opportunity and am very grateful to everyone involved at Caterham F1 Team for giving it to me. 'I feel ready for the challenge of my F1 debut and look forward to working as part of the Team in a race environment after all the work we've done together previously in the tests I've completed and back at Leafield in the sim (simulator). 'Hopefully this will be something we will be able to carry through to the 2015 season together.' Caterham head of engineering operations Gianluca Pisanello was pleased to have Stevens on board in Abu Dhabi as the team return to the track after missing out in the last two races in the United States and Brazil. He said: 'We know Will very well through his involvement in the Caterham Racing Academy. 'More importantly he has done a vast amount of time in our simulator, completing around 10,000km, which has built his experience both of this year's car and with the engineering team that are going to Abu Dhabi. 'In addition, his 2014 test at Silverstone in our current car, where he completed over 500km, was very successful and his race pace was very good.

The reviewer extensively shares their enjoyment of the movie, including elements such as car chases, gun shooting scenes, fight scenes, and the presence of a female character, usually termed as a 'token girl' in the film industry. While they mention that the movie does not excel in some of these aspects, they express their clear preference for the car-related scenes, particularly the chase sequence toward the end of the film. Furthermore, the reviewer defends the film's credibility and practicality, stating that what may seem like an unrealistic jump in the car chase is in fact, possible, as confirmed by IMDB. This points to the reviewer's appreciation for the film's realism, and the extent to which they trust and value the filmmakers' creative choices. Contrary to some critical opinions, the reviewer argues that the movie does have quality and that they genuinely enjoyed watching it so much that they 'loved' it. They even appreciated the film's ability to engage them without requiring them to constantly question the possibility or feasibility of what was occurring on screen. Finally, the reviewer gives a high rating to the movie, a solid 9 out of 10, further emphasizing their positive stance towards the film. Some might interpret the comment \\"I didn't need to turn off my brains to watch it\\" as negative, indicating the movie's simplicity or lack of depth; however, given the context and the reviewer’s overall positive tone, it seems the reviewer rather appreciates the movie's straightforward nature and the fact it did not force them into overly critical or skeptical thinking."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Black Book Context: In 1944, Rachel Stein, a Dutch-Jewish singer who had lived in Berlin before the war, is hiding from the Nazi regime in the occupied Netherlands. When the farmhouse where she had been hiding is accidentally destroyed by an American bomber, Rachel manages to escape the area thanks to a local man, Rob, and visits a lawyer named Smaal, who provides her with some of her father's money so that she can flee, helped by a man named Van Gein. Rachel and Rob are reunited with her family and try to flee by boat through the Biesbosch with other Jews from the Nazi-occupied part of the Netherlands to the liberated southern part of the country. However, it turns out to be a trap. They are ambushed on the river by members of the German SS, who kill them and rob the bodies of their cash and other valuables. Rachel alone survives, but she does not manage to escape from occupied territory. Using a non-Jewish alias, Ellis de Vries, Rachel becomes involved with a Dutch resistance group in the Hague, under the leadership of Gerben Kuipers and working closely with a doctor in the Resistance, Hans Akkermans. Smaal is in touch with this Resistance cell. When Kuipers' son and other members of the Resistance are captured, Ellis agrees to help by seducing local SD commander HauptsturmfÃ¼hrer Ludwig MÃ¼ntze, bleaching all of her hair blonde. MÃ¼ntze invites her to a party at the local SD headquarters, and there, Ellis recognises ObersturmfÃ¼hrer GÃ¼nther Franken, MÃ¼ntze's brutal deputy, as the SS officer who oversaw the massacre of her refugee party. She obtains a job as a secretary at the SD headquarters while also falling in love with MÃ¼ntze, who, in contrast to Franken, is not abusive or sadistic. He realises that her hair is bleached and she is a Jew, but does not care.

Read this and answer the question The similarities between Czech and Slovak led to the languages being considered a single language by a group of 19th-century scholars who called themselves \\"Czechoslavs\\" (Čechoslováci), believing that the peoples were connected in a way which excluded German Bohemians and (to a lesser extent) Hungarians and other Slavs. During the First Czechoslovak Republic (1918–1938), although \\"Czechoslovak\\" was designated as the republic's official language both Czech and Slovak written standards were used. Standard written Slovak was partially modeled on literary Czech, and Czech was preferred for some official functions in the Slovak half of the republic. Czech influence on Slovak was protested by Slovak scholars, and when Slovakia broke off from Czechoslovakia in 1938 as the Slovak State (which then aligned with Nazi Germany in World War II) literary Slovak was deliberately distanced from Czech. When the Axis powers lost the war and Czechoslovakia reformed, Slovak developed somewhat on its own (with Czech influence); during the Prague Spring of 1968, Slovak gained independence from (and equality with) Czech. Since then, \\"Czechoslovak\\" refers to improvised pidgins of the languages which have arisen from the decrease in mutual intelligibility.

That is the unfortunate truth,” Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland told a daily briefing. By 9 a.m. eastern time (1300 GMT,) those diagnosed with the coronavirus had risen by 15% to 7,708. The respective figures at 1200 ET on Monday were 66 deaths and 6,671 positive diagnoses. Chief public health officer Theresa Tam said she was particularly concerned the virus was spreading to enclosed settings where vulnerable people live, such as seniors’ residences, prisons and aboriginal communities. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Ottawa would invest 2 billion to support testing and to purchase ventilators and protective personal equipment such as masks, face shields, gowns and hand sanitizer. In Quebec, the second-most-populous of the 10 provinces, Premier Francois Legault said “my biggest concern right now is for the medical supplies. Currently, for some equipment, we have only (enough) for three to seven days”. New shipments should arrive “in the next few days,” he told a daily briefing. Ottawa has signed agreements with three Canadian companies to produce the needed supplies, with five other deals pending, said Trudeau. “We know that the demand for critical equipment and supplies will grow in the coming weeks, so we need a sustainable, stable supply,” he told reporters. “That means making them at home and we’re optimistic that they will be available in the coming weeks.”  Procurement Minister Anita Anand said Ottawa had already bought more than 157 million surgical masks. Boosting supplies of medical equipment is part of Ottawa’s response to an outbreak that has forced the closure of many businesses and schools. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said schools in what is the most populous province would be closed until at least May 1. “I’m prepared to extend these closures even further,” he added. Manitoba said it would close schools for the rest of school year. Ottawa has pledged financial help for people and employers hit by the crisis.

Wintergreen is an experienced patrolman looking to be transferred to homicide. When he is informed by Crazy Willie (Elisha Cook, Jr.) of an apparent suicide via shotgun, Wintergreen believes the case is actually a murder. Detective Harve Poole (Mitchell Ryan) agrees it is a homicide, after a .22 bullet is found in the man's skull during the autopsy, as well hearing about a possible missing 5,000 from the man's home, and arranges for Wintergreen to be transferred to homicide to help with the case. Wintergreen gets his wish, but his joy is short-lived. He begins increasingly to identify with the hippies whom the other officers, including Detective Poole, are endlessly harassing. The final straw comes when Poole discovers that Wintergreen has been sleeping with his girlfriend Jolene (Jeannine Riley). The hostile workplace politics cause him to be quickly demoted back to traffic enforcement. Despite being demoted, Wintergreen is able to solve the murder. The killer turns out to be Willie, who confesses while Wintergreen goads him into talking about it. Wintergreen surmises Willie did it because he was jealous of the old man he killed, who frequently had young people over to his house to buy drugs. Shortly after, it is discovered that Zipper stole the 5,000, which he used to buy a fully dressed Electra Glide motorcycle. Wintergreen is forced to shoot Zipper after he becomes distressed and belligerent, and shoots an innocent bystander while brandishing a gun. As the film ends, Wintergreen is alone and back on his old beat, when he runs into a hippie that Zipper was needlessly harassing near the beginning of the film. Wintergreen lets him off with a warning but the hippie forgets his driver's license, and Wintergreen drives up behind his van to return it to him. The hippie's passenger points a shotgun out the back window and shoots Wintergreen, killing him. My question: Who plays the girlfriend Jolene?

Regardless, they are very diverse even as a good monophyletic group, containing flashing and continuous-glow fireflies from the Holarctic and some tropical forms too.

No Based on the given premise, \\"'Don't call me that.\\", it is clear that the person is expressing their disapproval or discomfort with the use of a certain name, term, or label. They might not like it because it could be offensive, disrespectful, hurtful, or simply not an accurate representation of their identity or personality. Given this understanding, the hypothesis \\"It is fine if you call me that.\\" would not be true. The original premise indicates that the person specifically does not want to be called by that name, term, or label, and therefore, it would not be \\"fine\\" to continue using it. From a logical standpoint, the premise and hypothesis are contradictory. The premise asserts a negative statement, requesting not to be called by a specific term. The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests a positive statement that implies it is acceptable to continue using that term. Consequently, the two statements cannot coexist as true at the same time. To further illustrate this point, consider the following example: In a social setting, a person named James hears someone addressing him by a nickname he dislikes (e.g., \\"Jimmy\\"). He says, \\"Don't call me that.\\" Therefore, the premise is established: James does not want to be called \\"Jimmy.\\" Now, if we examine the hypothesis, \\"It is fine if you call me that (Jimmy)\\" in the context of the given premise, it becomes evident that this second statement is contrary to James's original sentiment. He already expressed his desire not to be called \\"Jimmy,\\" which indicates it is not fine to call him that. Consequently, the hypothesis cannot be true based on the information provided in the premise. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"It is fine if you call me that.\\" is not true, given the original premise \\"'Don't call me that.\\" The person's clear request not to be called by a specific name, term, or label directly contradicts the notion that it is acceptable to continue using that term."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"How did the STOVL aircraft take off from the deck?\\"  Context: \\"Another deck structure that can be seen is a ski-jump ramp at the forward end of the flight deck. This was first developed to help launch STOVL aircraft take off at far higher weights than is possible with a vertical or rolling takeoff on flat decks. Originally developed by the Royal Navy, it since has been adopted by many navies for smaller carriers. A ski-jump ramp works by converting some of the forward rolling movement of the aircraft into vertical velocity and is sometimes combined with the aiming of jet thrust partly downwards. This allows heavily loaded and fueled aircraft a few more precious seconds to attain sufficient air velocity and lift to sustain normal flight. Without a ski-jump launching fully loaded and fueled aircraft such as the Harrier would not be possible on a smaller flat deck ship before either stalling out or crashing directly into the sea.\\"  Answer:","output":"The Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) aircraft, such as the iconic Harrier jet, take off from the deck using a combination of engineering ingenuity and carefully orchestrated physics. The concept of STOVL aircraft was developed to allow for the efficient launching of heavily loaded and fueled aircraft from smaller carriers, where standard takeoff and landing procedures are not feasible. One innovative solution that has since been widely adopted is the introduction of a ski-jump ramp at the forward end of the flight deck. The ski-jump ramp was first developed by the Royal Navy and has since been incorporated into many smaller carriers around the world. The ramp works by converting some of the aircraft's forward rolling movement into vertical velocity, effectively providing the aircraft with an initial upward thrust as it leaves the ramp. This upward trajectory helps the aircraft attain sufficient airspeed and lift to stabilize and sustain normal flight in a shorter amount of time and distance compared to traditional flat deck takeoffs. In addition to the ski-jump ramp, another technique employed by STOVL aircraft is the directing of jet thrust partly downwards. This is achieved by rotating the jet engine exhaust nozzles to an angle where the jet blast is aimed downward, providing additional lift from the thrust vectoring. The combined effect of the ski-jump ramp and thrust vectoring allows heavily loaded and fueled STOVL aircraft to take off successfully, even if the available runway length on the carrier is limited. To further understand the process, let's break down the steps involved in a STOVL aircraft takeoff from the deck: 1. The STOVL aircraft positions itself at the beginning of the ski-jump ramp, facing forward. 2. With the jet engine nozzles directed partly downwards, the aircraft throttles up, increasing engine power to prepare for takeoff. 3. The aircraft begins its rolling takeoff and accelerates along the flight deck, transitioning from a flat surface to the upward-sloping ski-jump ramp. 4. As the STOVL aircraft approaches the end of the ramp, the conversion of forward rolling movement into vertical velocity occurs, giving the aircraft additional upward inertia. 5. The combined effect of the ski-jump ramp and the jet thrust directed partly downwards provides the necessary acceleration, lift, and additional vertical velocity for the aircraft to leave the carrier deck and gain altitude. 6. Once the STOVL aircraft has reached a sufficient airspeed and altitude, it transitions into normal horizontal flight. The pilot adjusts the jet engine nozzles back to a horizontal position, and the aircraft continues on its mission. In conclusion, the STOVL aircraft takeoff from the deck is made possible through the clever use of a ski-jump ramp, which provides extra lift and upward momentum to help these aircraft attain flight quickly and efficiently. The combination of the ramp design and the redirection of jet thrust helps to launch heavily loaded and fueled aircraft in a shorter distance and with a higher likelihood of success, providing an invaluable advantage for military operations on smaller carriers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Billie Jo (our daughter) was probably around ten years old when it happened. We had a young Black Labrador dog who had become quite smitten with chewing things up that she wasn't supposed to.

Looker, our black lab, had chewed up and eaten a 10 bill, my VCR remote control (probably around 1987), and a sticker-filled blackberry vine my wife had planted. How she did that one without serious repercussions is beyond me. She also had a habit of grabbing the mail as it slid through the slot that was in our front door, taking it out back and 'sorting' it for us. So what happened really came as no big surprise. My daughter was a very diligent student, never wanting to let down her teachers by not turning her homework in as soon as she got to school (at least until she hit 14). One morning our daughter was trying to find the math homework that she knew she had completed the night before.

Following the overtime win against the Ravens, the Redskins traveled to Cleveland Browns Stadium to take on the Cleveland Browns in hopes to gain their first five-game win streak since 2005. The game started slowly for the Redskins, behind rookie quarterback Kirk Cousins, filling in for fellow rookie Robert Griffin III, who sprained his LCL the week prior. After a series of punts, Cousins threw a pass over the middle that was intercepted by T. J. Ward and returned to the Washington 5. Cleveland then used their first-round rookie, Trent Richardson to punch it in and take a 7-0 lead. However, Cousins was able to settle in after this, as he fired a pass to Leonard Hankerson for a 54-yard score to even the game at 7 apiece. In the second, both teams continued to exchange possessions, and eventually scores, in a tit-for-tat manner, as Kai Forbath connected from 44 yards out to give Washington a 10-7 lead. Cleveland, however would respond with another Richardson touchdown, to take a 14-10 lead at halftime. In the third, Cleveland got the ball first, but Brandon Weeden threw an interception to Redskins linebacker Rob Jackson, and Washington quickly converted, as running back Alfred Morris scored from 3 yards out to put Washington back on top 17-14. Following a Cleveland punt, Washington drove down the field again, and Cousins again found Hankerson, this time from two yards away, and Washington took a 24-14 lead. In the fourth, Washington capitalized on a second Weeden interception, this time by London Fletcher, and capped off the drive with an Evan Royster 4-yard touchdown run to take a 31-14 lead. However, Cleveland would not surrender, as Weeden found wide receiver Travis Benjamin for a 69-yard strike, and got back into the game at 31-21. Not to be outdone, Cousins led a clock-chewing, 5 minute drive that culminated with Morris' 2nd Touchdown run of the day, this time from 8 yards out, to effectively put the game away, taking a 38-21 lead. Cleveland tried to answer, but went four and out, and Washington was able to run out the clock. With the win, the Redskins advance to 8-6 which guarantees them to end the season at .500 for the first time since 2008. Additionally, the win was their fifth consecutive win, their longest streak since Weeks 13-17 of the 2005 season. Most importantly, however, the New York Giants' 34-0 loss to the Atlanta Falcons put Washington in first place in the NFC East, meaning, if they win their final two games, they will be division champions for the first time since 1999.

Up in front of me was a giant billboard advertising yet another jeweler, in ten-foot letters and bright silver watches like massive alien machines. The traffic slowed and stopped on the ramp as it bottlenecked further into the city, and my head turned to examine the sign and the blocked view of the cityscape and land beyond. Past it was another billboard, with the name of a casino as its only text, filled with collaged images of money, plush rooms, and dancers. A quarter mile further brought me to an advertisement for business management solutions. Another few hundred yards and I was urged to try the new sandwich at the new sandwich place. The sun set and the signs stayed bright as automatic light switched on. The city grew dark and the hills beyond feebled out, existing only in our minds and finally not even there. All that remained were the well-lit and shiny reminders that lawyers were standing by to take my case to court, and that somebody's air conditioners would outlast somebody else's. I had an idea. I made the call the next day. It would put me back a good half grand, but it would be worth it. There would be no design meeting; I sent them the image and it was printed. A few weeks later it went up. Now on my commute, when I paused in the crush of metal bodies, I looked up and saw mountains by Maxfield Parrish, reaching up to the clouds in impossible cragginess, rivulets and gushing streams painted down their sides, with the sun striking vibrant oranges and reds into the shadows of the rocks. There were trees in copper-patina green and still pools quieter than the middle of winter but warm as the first day of summer. No doubt people thought it was the first part of a two-stage advertising gimmick, or a filler to be used when no one was renting space on the sign. But I was happy. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: The narrator saw the billboard for business management solutions: Options:  A.

It is believed that the Baltic languages are among the most archaic of the currently remaining Indo-European languages, despite their late attestation. Although the various Baltic tribes were mentioned by ancient historians as early as 98 B.C., the first attestation of a Baltic language was about 1350, with the creation of the Elbing Prussian Vocabulary, a German to Prussian translation dictionary. Lithuanian was first attested in a hymnal translation in 1545; the first printed book in Lithuanian, a Catechism by Martynas Mažvydas was published in 1547 in Königsberg, Prussia . Latvian appeared in a hymnal in 1530 and in a printed Catechism in 1585. One reason for the late attestation is that the Baltic peoples resisted Christianization longer than any other Europeans, which delayed the introduction of writing and isolated their languages from outside influence. With the establishment of a German state in Prussia, and the eradication or flight of much of the Baltic Prussian population in the 13th century, the remaining Prussians began to be assimilated, and by the end of the 17th century, the Prussian language had become extinct. During the years of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , official documents were written in Polish, Ruthenian and Latin. After the Partitions of Commonwealth, most of the Baltic lands were under the rule of the Russian Empire, where the native languages or alphabets were sometimes prohibited from being written down or used publicly in a Russification effort .

For example, how to go to school is a problem I often worry about. Every afternoon, my father picks me up at the gate of the school. Many parents pick up their children, too.  Most of them drive private cars. Of all the cars, Anna's father's car is the best. Anna seems to have a very rich father. She always has beautiful dresses, shoes and bags. Besides these, she is also very beautiful. But she has no friends in school. When other students are playing, she never joins them. I don't like her because she is too perfect. It makes me uncomfortable to make friends with her. She seems to have everything. One afternoon, when I went to my father's car, I saw a small thing fall out of Anna's bag.  So I called her quickly. However, she didn't look back and kept going. I felt very angry with her. During the dinner, my father asked me, \\"Why do you look unhappy?\\" \\"Today I saw something fall out of Anna's bag, so called her.  But she didn't answer me. She is _ . \\" said angrily. \\"Oh, I know that girl. She has no friends and is unhappy because she was born deaf. I'm sure that she didn't hear you. \\" What my father said suddenly woke me up. Because she is deaf, she does not talk or play with anyone at school.  She seems to have everything, but in fact she doesn't. Not everyone is perfect, even the perfect man has his weakness. Question: Why doesn't the writer like Anna? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Because Anna seems to be the best in everything.\\"? Answer:","output":"The writer initially does not like Anna because Anna seems to be the best in everything, as evidenced by her beautiful possessions and appearance. This perfection makes the writer uncomfortable and hesitant to befriend Anna. However, it is essential to consider that the writer's opinion changes upon discovering that Anna is deaf, which influences her inability to communicate and socialize with others at school. As a result, the initially perceived perfection is challenged, understanding that nobody is perfect, and everyone has their weaknesses. In conclusion, although the initial answer to the question could be \\"Yes\\", it is crucial to acknowledge that the writer's perspective changes after learning about Anna's deafness, which provides a deeper understanding of her character and challenges the idea of her being perfect in everything."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(A). yes (B). it is not possible to tell (C). no Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"(A). Yes The premise and the hypothesis presented share a very close relationship and support each other. They both converge towards the same notion – federal spending, if well-directed towards infrastructure, education, and Research & Development (R&D), can enhance the productivity of the private sector in the long-term. Let's decompose both the premise and the hypothesis to understand this correlation better. The premise from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) underscores that appropriate and strategic federal spending on certain realms — namely infrastructure, education, and R&D — intended explicitly to enhance long-term productivity in the private sector, can be considered a federal investment. This statement already establishes a direct relationship between such targeted spending and productivity enhancement.  The term 'investment' in this context can be inferred to signify a venture that brings in returns over time, adding value to the economy. In the case of the GAO's statement, the return on investment is the increased long-term productivity of the private sector. Therefore, it argues that investing in these specific areas is not an expense but a strategic move expected to generate greater output. The hypothesis, on the other hand, postulates that well-chosen federal spending on infrastructure, education, and R&D can enhance productivity because they are compatible. The term 'compatible' here can imply that there exists a synergistic relationship among these sectors that can contribute to increased productivity. Infrastructure, education, and R&D form the troika that directly contributes to the betterment of the economy, societal advancement, and technological development. Quality infrastructure provides the physical systems and structures needed for developing a thriving business environment. Investing in education generates a skilled workforce capable of fostering innovation, production, and efficiency. And funding R&D leads to new technologies and innovations, improving productivity and competitive advantage. Thus, observing both the statements, it can be concluded that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. Given their inherent compatibility, their cumulative effect would naturally enhance the private sector's productivity in the long run."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

John found it interesting that many species have evolved in the course of history.  Would era A see less or more biodiversity than era B? A:","output":"A: The comparison of biodiversity between era A, when dinosaurs were flourishing prior to 66 million years ago, and era B, the time period marked by the mass extinction event around 66 million years ago, requires a comprehensive understanding of the various aspects influencing biodiversity during these two distinct periods. During era A, dinosaurs were the dominant group of terrestrial animals and inhabited a diverse range of ecosystems across the planet, including forests, coastal plains, and deserts. The presence of numerous habitats allowed for the evolution of a wide variety of dinosaur species, with some estimates suggesting that over 1,000 different species existed during this period. Additionally, era A witnessed the development of other groups of organisms, such as marine reptiles, mammals, insects, early birds, and plant life. All of these factors contributed to a rich and varied collection of species at both the global and ecosystem level, resulting in a high level of biodiversity. On the other hand, era B, identified by the mass extinction event 66 million years ago, was marked by significant disruptions to Earth's ecosystems, with estimated extinction rates of approximately 75% of all species on the planet. This event, known as the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event, was likely a consequence of a combination of factors, including the massive impact of an asteroid and extreme volcanic activity. The widespread destruction caused by these events led to the collapse of numerous ecosystems and a drastic reduction in biodiversity, both on land and in the ocean. Following the mass extinction in era B, biodiversity began to rebound in the subsequent time periods, with the emergence of new groups of animals and plants. The extinction of non-avian dinosaurs created a variety of open niches, enabling the radiation and evolution of numerous new lineages, including the early ancestors of mammals. This process of diversification and recovery eventually gave rise to the modern assemblage of species that we know today. In conclusion, era A, when dinosaurs were flourishing, exhibited a much greater level of biodiversity compared to era B, marked by the mass extinction event. While the extinction event led to the extinction of a large proportion of species, it also allowed for the evolution and diversification of new lineages, ultimately shaping the course of Earth's natural history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(AP) -- A group of black parents and civil rights activists presented a petition  Thursday calling for officials to drop charges against a 16-year-old South Carolina high school student who was videotaped being dragged from her desk and thrown to the floor by a police officer in her classroom. The group said it was unfair and unacceptable that the student and her 18-year-old classmate at Spring Valley High School who taped the incident were the only people charged that day when authorities already knew Richland County Deputy Ben Fields had tossed the girl from her desk to the ground. They also said their petition had hundreds of thousands of names from around the country asking prosecutor Dan Johnson to drop the \\"disturbing schools\\" charges against the teens. The students in the case are black; Fields is white. Johnson issued a statement Wednesday saying he won't do anything with the case until the FBI finishes its investigation into Fields, who was fired after the video became public. \\"I do not simply decide cases based upon feelings, public opinion or sentiment, nor do I decide them based on political pressure,\\" Johnson said in the statement. Disturbing schools is punishable by a fine of up to 1,000 or 90 days in jail. The students' lawyer did not respond to telephone messages. The video spread quickly across the country, prompting questions about when police officers should get involved with classroom discipline.

In the same year he accepted an invitation from the BBC to compose his first opera. He decided to base it on Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, but his preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948 when Alice Wimborne died. To take Walton's mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey persuaded him to be a British delegate to a conference on copyright in Buenos Aires later that year.  While there, Walton met Susana Gil Passo (1926–2010), daughter of an Argentine lawyer. At 22 she was 24 years younger than Walton (Alice Wimborne had been 22 years his senior), and at first she ridiculed his romantic interest in her. He persisted, and she eventually accepted his proposal of marriage. The wedding was held in Buenos Aires in December 1948. From the start of their marriage, the couple spent half the year on the Italian island of Ischia, and by the mid-1950s they lived there permanently.Walton's last work of the 1940s was his music for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera Troilus and Cressida. On the advice of the BBC, he invited Christopher Hassall to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's relations with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or she should have been asked to be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of Façade, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II he was again called on to write a coronation march, Orb and Sceptre; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the Te Deum for the occasion.Troilus and Cressida was presented at Covent Garden on 3 December 1954.

Plot title: Dog Day Afternoon Movie plot: Based upon a real-life story that happened in the early seventies in which the Chase Manhattan Bank in Flatbush, Brooklyn, was held siege by a gay bank robber determined to steal enough money for his male lover to undergo a sex change operation. On a hot summer afternoon, the First Savings Bank of Brooklyn is held up by Sonny Wortzik and Sal two down-and-out characters. Although the bank manager and female tellers agree not to interfere with the robbery, Sonny finds that there's actually nothing much to steal, as most of the cash has been picked up for the day. Sonny then gets an unexpected phone call from Police Captain Eugene Moretti, who tells him the place is surrounded by the city's entire police force. Having few options under the circumstances, Sonny nervously bargains with Moretti, demanding safe escort to the airport and a plane out of the country in return for the bank employees' safety. Written by alfiehitchieFirst-time crook Sonny Wortzik (Al Pacino) and his friend Sal (John Cazale) rob a Brooklyn bank to fund Sonny's boyfriend's sex change operation, only to discover that the bank has very little money. Unsure what to do, the two robbers camp out in the bank, holding all the workers hostage. The police are alerted that there is a robbery in progress. Detective Eugene Moretti (Charles Durning) and numerous officers set up a siege around the bank. When Moretti calls the bank to tell the lead robber, Sonny, that the police have arrived, Sonny warns that he and his armed accomplice, Sal, have hostages and will kill them if anyone tries to come into the bank. Detective Moretti acts as hostage negotiator, while FBI Agent Sheldon (James Broderick) monitors his actions. Howard (John Marriott), the security guard, has an asthma attack, so Sonny releases him when Moretti asks for a hostage as a sign of good faith. Moretti convinces Sonny to step outside the bank to see how aggressive the police forces are.

Film company Lionsgate said it was \\"pleased\\" with the result, and noted there was little competition for the film's teen audience over Easter. Elsewhere, Sean Penn's action movie The Gunman fired a blank with US audiences. The star could only muster 5m (£3.3m) for the tough tale of Congo mercenaries, which he co-wrote and co-produced. It had been hoped the film would capitalise on the audience for the \\"geriaction\\" genre - popularised by Liam Neeson's Taken series, with which The Gunman shares a director, Pierre Morel. However, reviews were resoundingly negative. The Atlantic's Christopher Orr called it \\"a dull, generic retread, made far worse by Penn's self-seriousness as an actor, by the banal political pieties he's grafted on as producer and co-writer, and by the presence of a pitifully retrograde female lead role.\\" Thanks to a slow weekend at the cinema, The Gunman managed a number four chart position, beaten by Insurgent, Cinderella and Liam Neeson's own action thriller Run All Night.

The current king's father died in a plane crash in 1947, when Carl Gustav was only nine months old. During his long royal apprenticeship, Carl Gustav underwent the usual military training, but also studied history, politics and economics at Swedish universities, served in the diplomatic corps, and worked in banking and commerce. Constitutional changes in 1974 deprived the king of all but ceremonial duties, such as opening parliament and representing Sweden at the diplomatic level.

He put together the coalition after parliamentary elections of September 2014, in which his party gained 31% of the votes and the Greens 7%. He promised he would seek wide support for his plans to boost welfare, schools and jobs. Mr Lofven was only elected to parliament in the elections which brought him to power. The former welder headed the Swedish Metalworkers' Union (IF Metall) between 2006 and 2012, when he was elected as leader of the Social Democrats.

You may recall that it is a collection matter for about 1,800,000 for breach of spot gas purchase contracts by Triad. We tried to arbitrate, but Triad wouldn't answer the arbitration (even though I got calls from Purnell afterward, who asked if there was some way we could settle the arbitration). We then filed suit in the 125th Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas, against both Triad and Purnell, to see if that would smoke them out. As you know, after filing our original petition, we found an inadvertant technical error in it that required correction, and at no charge to you refiled a first amended petition that corrected the error. Since then, we served the first amended petition and citations on the Secretary of State of the State of Texas, as is allowed by law under such circumstances. The Secretary of State then forwarded the first amended petition and citations to the addresses we gave them, by certified mail, r.r.r. At this time, which is long after the expiration of the answer date, no certified mail receipt has reportedly been received by the Secretary of State from Purnell or Triad. No answer or other pleading has been filed by Triad or Purnell. This is not unexpected, given that Triad dodged us during the attempted arbitration. The caselaw supports the position that we have made effective service on both Triad and Purnell, although there is some room to argue that the Secretary of State has to receive a green card back, even if it is marked \\"refused\\". If we wanted to try to nail this point down by going to the additional expense of personal service on Triad and Purnell, we could, but if Purnell is not going to respond to registered mail, he will likely attempt to dodge personal service as well. I am not recommending it. We will shortly receive from the Secretary of State the so-called \\"Whitney Certificate\\" and file-stamped copies of the citations, which we will file with the court, along with a motion for entry of default judgment. I will make sure you see a draft before it is filed. We will need to set a hearing on our motion, and produce evidence of our damages. I would not expect the hearing to take more than an hour.

Candyman. Answer:","output":"Title: Echoes of the Past Genre: Horror/Thriller Plot: Helen Young, a curious and ambitious graduate student, is pursuing her lifelong passion for urban legends and folklore at a prestigious university. Her latest research project focuses on the infamous Candyman, a vengeful spirit rumored to haunt an eerie, decaying apartment complex known as Cabrini Green. Working alongside her supportive boyfriend Michael and her knowledgeable yet guarded professor Dr. Thomas, Helen discovers the chilling tale of Candyman. Born as Daniel Robitaille, a talented black artist, he fell in love with a white woman against the social taboos of the 19th century. As a result, he was hunted down and brutally lynched by a furious mob. Cursed to avenge his horrific death, Daniel returned as the vengeful specter Candyman, haunting and tormenting anyone who dared summon him by chanting his name five times in front of a mirror. Unsatisfied with her findings, Helen feels compelled to dig deeper and prove that Candyman is nothing but a myth fueled by local anxieties. She visits Cabrini Green to interview the residents, most of whom are terrified by the mere mention of the ghastly figure. They share harrowing stories of unsolved murders and unsettling supernatural events, blaming the elusive Candyman for the violence that plagues their lives. Encounters with the charming but cryptic Clarice, an unassuming local woman with a mysterious connection to Candyman, lead Helen to question the disturbing connection between her past, the vengeful spirit, and the terrified residents of Cabrini Green. Driven to demystify the legend, Helen performs the forbidden ritual in front of a mirror, unconvinced of the consequences. Days later, Helen finds herself being stalked by Candyman, who terrorizes her in increasingly frightening ways. In an intense confrontation in a parking garage, the horrifying figure appears to Helen, confirming her worst fears and offering her a chilling ultimatum: join him in his afterlife, or watch him murder everyone she loves. Shattered by the encounter, Helen turns to a desperate Dr. Thomas for help. Together, they race against time to decipher a cryptic prophecy that holds the key to breaking the curse that binds Candyman to his eternal torment. As the vengeful spirit hunts her loved ones, Helen must use her extensive knowledge of urban legends to devise a plan to vanquish him forever. In a thrilling final confrontation, Helen discovers that Clarice is, in fact, a descendent of Candyman's lost lover, making her the key to freeing his soul. With everything hanging in the balance, Helen, Michael, Dr. Thomas, and Clarice come together in a deadly showdown at Cabrini Green. While they successfully break the curse and banish Candyman back to the afterlife, not everyone makes it out unscathed, leaving Helen to come to terms with the consequences of her choices and the darkness that lingers in the echoes of the past."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Marlin rode low in the saddle, his shoulders curled against the hungry wind. His hat was pulled down tight and his eyes didn't move as he passed the crude shacks at the edge of town. He tied his horse in front of the saloon, unwinding his long body as if a sudden movement might snap it. He turned down the collar of his greatcoat and checked to make sure his big Army Colt was loose in its holster. The saloon door was a single chunk of white pine, still oozing sap, and he had to put his shoulder to it to force it open. The long room inside was quiet, and not much warmer than the street. Clusters of people sat nursing coffee and drinks, talking quietly if they talked at all. Marlin spotted a few farmers the railroad had brought in from Europe: rounded hats, nervous eyes, skin as red as blood. At the far end of the room a half-dozen cowboys turned over cards with patient boredom. Marlin walked up to the bar. \\"Whiskey,\\" he said, and when the drink came he tossed it straight down and felt it pull his lips into a grimace. He nodded for a refill. When he turned to face the room they were all watching him. \\"I'm looking for a man named Kraamer,\\" Marlin said. \\"Anybody here know of him?\\" One of the cowboys turned casually and rang the spittoon with a stream of tobacco juice. Marlin knew the long, thin face from somewhere, the blond hair that fell limply to his shoulders. He smiled at Marlin and showed his brown-stained teeth. Marlin felt the lines in his own face, the gray in his hair, the chill in his bones. He was too old for this. He set a half dollar on the bar and started for the door. \\"Don't get in a huff,\\" the bartender said. Marlin looked back. \\"Kraamer lives about a mile west of town. Follow the railroad and take the first trail south.\\" Why is Marlin looking for Kraamer?

That was before we entered the permissive period in education in which we decided it was all right not to push our children to achieve their best in school. The schools and the educators made it easy for us. They taught that it was all right to be parents who take a let-alone policy. We stopped making our children do homework. We gave them calculators, turned on the television, left the teaching to the teachers and went on vacation. Now teachers, faced with children who have been developing at their own pace for the past 15 years, are realizing we've made a terrible mistake. One such teacher is Sharon Clomps who says of her students--\\"so passive\\" --and wonders what has happened. Nothing is demanded of them, she believes. Television, says Clomps, contributes to children's passivity. \\"We're talking about a generation of kids who' vet never been hurt or hungry.

The equation is: -15*k + 60 + 22 + 53 = 0 Now, combine the constant terms: -15*k + 135 = 0 Next, we will isolate the variable k to one side of the equation in order to solve for it. Step 1. Subtract 135 from both sides of the equation: -15*k + 135 - 135 = 0 - 135 This simplifies to: -15*k = -135 Step 2. To isolate k, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -15. -15*k / -15 = -135 / -15 This simplifies to: k = 9 So, the answer to the equation -15*k + 60 + 22 + 53 = 0 for k is k = 9."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who worked professionally in archaeology, and specialised in the Romano-British period?  Sir Robert Eric Mortimer Wheeler (10 September 1890 – 22 July 1976) was a British archaeologist and officer in the British Army. Over the course of his career, he served as Director of both the National Museum of Wales and London Museum, Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India, and the founder and Honorary Director of the Institute of Archaeology in London, in addition to writing twenty-four books on archaeological subjects. Born in Glasgow to a middle-class family, Wheeler was raised largely in Yorkshire before relocating to London in his teenage years. After studying classics at University College London (UCL), he began working professionally in archaeology, specialising in the Romano-British period. During World War I he volunteered for service in the Royal Artillery, being stationed on the Western Front, where he rose to the rank of major and was awarded the Military Cross. Returning to Britain, he obtained his doctorate from UCL before taking on a position at the National Museum of Wales, first as Keeper of Archaeology and then as Director, during which time he oversaw excavation at the Roman forts of Segontium, Y Gaer, and Isca Augusta with the aid of his first wife, Tessa Wheeler. Influenced by the archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers, Wheeler argued that excavation and the recording of stratigraphic context required an increasingly scientific and methodical approach, developing the \\"Wheeler method\\". In 1926, he was appointed Keeper of the London Museum; there, he oversaw a reorganisation of the collection, successfully lobbied for increased funding, and began lecturing at UCL. In 1934, he established the Institute of Archaeology as part of the federal University of London, adopting the position of Honorary Director. In this period, he oversaw excavations of the Roman sites at Lydney Park and Verulamium and the Iron Age hill fort of Maiden Castle. During World War II, he re-joined the Armed Forces and rose to the rank of brigadier, serving in the North African Campaign and then the Allied...

Does the word \\"run\\" have the same definition in the next two sentences? The crowd had to run away from the burning structure with only the clothes on their backs. If you see this man, run!","output":"The word \\"run\\" appears to hold similar fundamental meanings in both sentences, but its usage and implications are different due to the contextual variations of both situations. In the first sentence, \\"The crowd had to run away from the burning structure with only the clothes on their backs,\\" the meaning of \\"run\\" is essentially focused on the act of running as an urgent means to escape a dangerous situation—the burning structure. In this case, the word \\"run\\" marks the crowd's hurried movement away from the life-threatening event, the fire. It is not only about the actual motion and speed of running but also conveys a sense of urgency, fear, and helplessness that the people involved must deal with in that moment. This act is mainly driven by the necessity to create distance from the hazard and find safety as soon as possible. In the second sentence, \\"If you see this man, run!\\" the word \\"run\\" also refers to the physical act of running as a response to a potential threat posed by the man mentioned. In this context, the term \\"run\\" serves as an imperative, advising the listener (or reader) to flee the situation hastily whenever they encounter the person described. Similarly, the context implies urgency and evokes a sense of fear or worry concerning the safety of the individual receiving the advice. However, unlike the first sentence, this sentence does not provide information about the severity or nature of the threat the man poses, making it somewhat open to interpretation. In conclusion, while both sentences use \\"run\\" with the primary meaning of engaging in a rapid way of walking or hastened movement, their contextual differences influence the urgency, fear, and distinct reasons behind running in each scenario. The first sentence discusses running as a necessary consequence of a dangerous event, while the second sentence implies the act of running as a cautionary reaction to an individual who may represent a threat."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Given the fact that:  As you go farther from the nucleus of an atom, the electron levels have more and more energy.  Answer the question:   Lonnie works in a lab. He is studying atoms and discovers that the electrons that are farther away from the nucleus are moving less. or more? The answer is:","output":"The electrons that are farther away from the nucleus are moving more. To give a more comprehensive answer to this question, it is essential to understand the structure of an atom and its relation to the energy levels and the movement of electrons. An atom consists of a nucleus, which contains protons and neutrons, and electrons orbiting around it. These electrons are arranged in different energy levels or electron shells, which can be thought of as concentric spheres surrounding the nucleus. Each electron shell can hold a particular number of electrons, and electrons within the same shell have approximately the same energy level. The movement of electrons is tied to their energy levels. As electrons are further away from the nucleus, they move in higher energy levels or electron shells. According to the principles of quantum mechanics, electrons with higher energy levels move faster than those with lower energy levels. This is because their energy is associated with motion, and thus, they need to move more rapidly to sustain such energy levels. Lonnie's observation of electrons moving less or more is essentially a study of electron energy and velocity. The increased distance of electrons from the nucleus corresponds to higher energy levels, which in turn results in faster-moving electrons. This relationship between distance, energy, and velocity can be explained through the following reasons: 1. Increased distance from the nucleus corresponds to a weaker electrostatic force between the electrons and the protons in the nucleus. To maintain their orbits and balance the centrifugal force resulting from their motion, electrons at a greater distance from the nucleus must move more quickly. 2. Electrons in higher energy levels have a larger range of possible movements. As an electron occupies a higher energy level, it can exist in a greater number of positions ranging from closer to the nucleus to farther away. This increased freedom of motion requires higher energy and, consequently, higher velocity. In summary, based on the fact that energy levels increase as one moves farther from the nucleus, Lonnie's observation of electrons moving less or more would indicate that electrons farther away from the nucleus move more due to their higher energy levels and need to counteract the weaker electrostatic force with the nucleus. This understanding of electron behavior aligns with the fundamental principles of atomic structure and quantum mechanics."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Washing clothes manually leads to what?

During photosynthesis, plants absorb light energy from the Sun and convert it into chemical energy in the form of glucose. Which compounds combine in the presence of sunlight to form glucose?","output":"To identify the compounds that combine during photosynthesis to form glucose, let's go through the process step-by-step: 1. Absorption of light energy: During photosynthesis, plants contain chlorophyll, a green pigment that captures light energy from the Sun. 2. Conversion of light energy: Light energy is used to split water molecules (H2O) through a process called photolysis. This process results in the production of oxygen (O2) and hydrogen ions (H+). 3. Formation of energy molecules: The hydrogen ions generated in the previous step, along with the light energy captured by chlorophyll, help produce energy molecules, namely adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). 4. Carbon fixation: In the presence of enzymes, plants utilize CO2 (carbon dioxide) from the atmosphere in a process called carbon fixation, which occurs in the Calvin cycle. 5. Production of glucose: Through a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions in the Calvin cycle, the energy stored in ATP and NADPH molecules, along with carbon dioxide, is used to produce glucose (C6H12O6) and other organic molecules. To sum up, in the presence of sunlight, water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are the main compounds that combine to form glucose (C6H12O6) during photosynthesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Use the following highlights to write an article: Enric Sala, National Geographic's explorer-in-residence, is aiming to clean up the seas. His latest mission took him to relatively unknown waters off New Caledonia. As a child he was inspired by the work of prestigious explorer Jacques Cousteau. Previously he thought all hope was lost to restoring the seas, he has since changed his mind.","output":"Title: Enric Sala: The Modern-Day Cousteau on a Mission to Restore the Seas Subtitle: National Geographic's Explorer-in-Residence Takes on the Depths of New Caledonia to Preserve the Ocean's Wonders Introduction: Enric Sala, National Geographic's renowned explorer-in-residence, has been on an incredible journey to not only explore but also to help restore the health of our planet's oceans. Drawing inspiration from the illustrious Jacques Cousteau, Sala has ventured into the relatively unknown waters off the coast of New Caledonia, striving to make a meaningful difference for the future of our seas. Step 1: Establish the background and inspiration of Enric Sala Growing up enamored by the work of Jacques Cousteau, Enric Sala's fascination with the ocean and its underwater universe led him to pursue a career in marine exploration and conservation. Cousteau's groundbreaking contributions to understanding, exploring, and preserving the sea ignited a passion in Sala, who would eventually follow in the footsteps of his childhood hero. Step 2: Describe the turning point in Sala's mindset Despite the mounting pressures facing our oceans, from pollution to rising temperatures, Sala at one time believed that it might be too late for humanity to right the wrongs inflicted upon our oceans. However, his optimism was rekindled, recognizing the importance of taking action now in order to protect and restore the seas for generations to come. Step 3: Introduce his latest mission to New Caledonia Sala's most recent adventure took him to the relatively uncharted waters off the coast of New Caledonia, a South Pacific territory known for its vibrant marine life and stunning coral reefs. Little is known about these waters, making Sala's expedition an important contribution to our understanding of this unique and complex ecosystem. Step 4: Explain the goals of Sala's mission As a pioneer in marine conservation, Sala's primary objective during his New Caledonia expedition was to explore, document, and ultimately devise strategies to protect and restore the region's rich biodiversity. With the world's coral reefs facing an existential crisis, Sala's work is all the more crucial in efforts to save these vital ecosystems. Step 5: Discuss the potential impact of his work Enric Sala's relentless drive to preserve the world's oceans is an inspiring testament to the human spirit. Should his efforts in New Caledonia prove successful, his work could be pivotal in inspiring others to join forces in safeguarding our planet's underwater treasures. By following in the footsteps of the great Cousteau, Sala is blazing a new trail for future generations of ocean explorers and conservationists, ensuring that the earth's marine ecosystems continue to thrive for years to come. Conclusion: Although Enric Sala once believed that restoring the seas was a lost cause, he has since changed his outlook and dedicated himself to the pursuit of oceanic preservation. Guided by the pioneering spirit of Jacques Cousteau, Sala's exploration and conservation efforts in New Caledonia are a shining beacon of hope for the future health of our oceans. As this modern-day Cousteau continues to push the boundaries of marine research, we are reminded of the wonder and fragility of the underwater world, and our collective responsibility to protect it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Prior to 1873, the silver dollar circulated in many parts of the world, with a value in relation to the British gold British sovereign coin of roughly 1  4s 2d (21p approx). As a result of the decision of the German Empire to stop minting silver thaler coins in 1871, in the wake of the Franco-Prussian War, the worldwide price of silver began to fall. This resulted in the U.S. Coinage Act (1873) which put the United States onto a de facto gold standard. Canada and History of Newfoundland and Labrador were already on the gold standard, and the result was that the value of the dollar in North America increased in relation to silver dollars being used elsewhere, particularly Latin America and the Far East. By 1900, value of silver dollars had fallen to 50 percent of gold dollars. Following the abandonment of the gold standard by Canada in 1931, the Canadian dollar began to drift away from parity with the U.S. dollar. It returned to parity a few times, but since the end of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates that was agreed to in 1944, the Canadian dollar has been floating against the U.S. dollar. The silver dollars of Latin America and South East Asia began to diverge from each other as well during the course of the 20th century. The Straits dollar adopted a gold exchange standard in 1906 after it had been forced to rise in value against other silver dollars in the region. Hence, by 1935, when China and Hong Kong came off the silver standard, the Straits dollar was worth 2s 4d (11.5p approx) Pound sterling, whereas the Hong Kong dollar was worth only 1s 3d sterling (6p approx).

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"No, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other, but they are related. The first question is about identifying your comfort zone, while the second question is about stepping out of it. Here is a detailed explanation for both questions: 1. How can I know what my comfort zone is? Your comfort zone is a mental and emotional state where you feel familiar, safe, at ease, and in control of your environment and circumstances. It defines the boundary between activities or situations that you find comfortable and those that you consider challenging or threatening. To identify your comfort zone, you can follow these steps: a. Self-reflection: Spend some time contemplating your life, routines, and experiences. Identify patterns of situations and activities that consistently cause you discomfort, anxiety, or stress. b. Journaling: Writing down your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors will make it easier for you to spot your comfort zone boundaries. Record the activities that you find enjoyable and those that you avoid or feel hesitant to undertake. c. List your fears and anxieties: Prepare a list of situations, people, or things that make you feel afraid, stressed, or anxious. This could include public speaking, meeting new people, trying out new activities, or dealing with failure. d. Seek feedback: Talk to people who know you well, such as friends, family members, or colleagues. Ask them to help you identify your comfort zone by sharing their observations about your habits, behavior, and reactions to different situations. e. Assess your emotional reactions: Pay attention to your emotions when faced with new or challenging experiences. If you feel a strong resistance, fear, or anxiety, it's likely that you are encountering the edge of your comfort zone. 2. How can I come out of my comfort zone? To step out of your comfort zone, you need to push your boundaries, face your fears, and be open to experiencing discomfort. Here are some suggestions to help you do this: a. Set challenging goals: Identify personal or professional goals that force you to step outside your existing comfort zone. This could include developing a new skill, joining a social club, or volunteering for a challenging assignment at work. b. Take small steps: Gradually increase your tolerance for discomfort by starting with smaller challenges and working your way up as you become more comfortable. This method will help you build confidence and create positive momentum. c. Embrace failure: Accept that setbacks and failures are a natural part of personal growth. Be willing to face the possibility of failure as a valuable learning experience that can help you grow and improve. d. Develop a growth mindset: Cultivate the belief that you can improve, learn, and develop new skills and abilities. A growth mindset will help you be more open to pushing your boundaries and taking on new challenges. e. Seek support: Surround yourself with positive, supportive people who encourage you to step outside your comfort zone. Having a strong support network will make it easier for you to face challenges and overcome fear. f. Practice mindfulness: Learn to be present in the moment and accept your feelings of discomfort without judgment. Mindfulness techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga, can help you relax and be more receptive to new experiences. By understanding your comfort zone and learning how to step out of it, you can unlock new opportunities for personal and professional growth, gain greater self-awareness, and lead a more fulfilling life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After training in singing, strings playing and composition, Monteverdi worked as a musician in Verona and Milan until, in 1590 or 1591, he secured a post as suonatore di vivuola (viola player) at Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga's court at Mantua. Through ability and hard work Monteverdi rose to become Gonzaga's maestro della musica (master of music) in 1601.Vincenzo Gonzaga's particular passion for musical theatre and spectacle grew from his family connections with the court of Florence. Towards the end of the 16th century innovative Florentine musicians were developing the intermedio—a long-established form of musical interlude inserted between the acts of spoken dramas—into increasingly elaborate forms. Led by Jacopo Corsi, these successors to the renowned Camerata were responsible for the first work generally recognised as belonging to the genre of opera: Dafne, composed by Corsi and Jacopo Peri and performed in Florence in 1598. This work combined elements of madrigal singing and monody with dancing and instrumental passages to form a dramatic whole. Only fragments of its music still exist, but several other Florentine works of the same period—Rappresentatione di Anima, et di Corpo by Emilio de' Cavalieri, Peri's Euridice and Giulio Caccini's identically titled Euridice—survive complete. These last two works were the first of many musical representations of the Orpheus myth as recounted in Ovid's Metamorphoses, and as such were direct precursors of Monteverdi's L'Orfeo.The Gonzaga court had a long history of promoting dramatic entertainment. A century before Duke Vincenzo's time the court had staged Angelo Poliziano's lyrical drama La favola di Orfeo, at least half of which was sung rather than spoken. More recently, in 1598 Monteverdi had helped the court's musical establishment produce Giovanni Battista Guarini's play Il pastor fido, described..., what would be the answer ? A:","output":"The answer to the question regarding the specific titles of the two separate works with identical names that were the first of many musical representations of the Orpheus myth as recounted in Ovid's Metamorphoses is: both works are titled \\"Euridice.\\" These two compositions with the same name were created by two different composers, Jacopo Peri and Giulio Caccini. These works are considered direct precursors to Monteverdi's famous opera, L'Orfeo. The Euridice operas by Peri and Caccini emerged during a time when innovative Florentine musicians were developing the intermedio – a form of musical interlude inserted between acts of spoken dramas – into increasingly elaborate forms. This innovation eventually led to the creation of the opera genre, as evidenced by works like Dafne, composed by Jacopo Corsi and Jacopo Peri, which was performed in Florence in 1598.  Peri's and Caccini's compositions of Euridice incorporated elements of madrigal singing and monody with dancing and instrumental passages, creating a dramatic whole that would pave the way for subsequent representations of the Orpheus myth in music, including Monteverdi's L'Orfeo."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Ending weeks of political speculation, Marco Rubio announced Wednesday he has changed his mind and will run for re-election to the U.S. Senate, reversing his pledge to return to private life after his presidential campaign collapsed three months ago.      His decision could give Republicans an edge in one of the most competitive Senate races in the country — and keep Rubio in the public eye ahead of the next presidential election in 2020.      Rubio cited a sense of duty to try to remain in Congress under either President Donald Trump or President Hillary Clinton, two candidates he considers mediocre.      “No matter who’s elected president, there’s reason to worry. If it’s Hillary Clinton, you know we’re going to have four more years of the same failed economic policies, four more years of the same failed foreign policy,” he told the Miami Herald. “The prospect of a Trump presidency is also worrisome to me in many ways.”      20 for 365 Days of Unlimited Digital Access Last chance to take advantage of our best offer of the year! Act now!      Rubio has said he’ll vote for Trump. If Trump wins, Rubio said that as a senator he would “encourage him in the right direction, but if it’s necessary, stand up to him.”      “It’s no secret that I have significant disagreements with Donald,” he said. “And his positions on many key issues are unknown, and many of the statements — especially about women and minorities — are statements that I find not just offensive but unacceptable.”      National Republicans fearful of losing Senate control to Democrats mounted a campaign to keep Rubio on the ballot for Florida’s swing seat. He consented just two days before Friday’s qualifying deadline, pointing to the Senate’s “check and balance on the excesses of the president.”      SHARE COPY LINK Marco Rubio bids farewell to his presidential campaign at Florida International University after losing the Florida primary to Donald Trump on Tuesday, March 15, 2016.      He made no commitments about his future ambitions, declining to say if he’d serve a full, six-year term — or run again for president in 2020 or 2024.      “What I’m done making is unequivocal statements about anything at this point,” he said. “I don’t even know who the next president’s going to be. But I will say this to you: If I wanted to run for president in 2020, running for re-election in 2016 was probably not the best choice to make politically.”      Rubio’s decision carries some political risk. He has only a couple of months to organize a campaign and pitch himself again to voters, some of whom start casting ballots in July for the Aug. 30 primary. If he wins, he could substantially boost his chance to become a future presidential candidate. If he loses, he undermines his political career with two major failures in a single year, perhaps forcing him to abandon his White House ambitions.      “It’s never been a goal of mine to lose two elections in a year,” Rubio said. “It’s going to be a tough race. I have no illusions about that.”      Rubio’s announcement quickly upended the GOP primary contest to replace him: Two of his would-be rivals, Florida Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera and U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis, left the race, with DeSantis choosing to run for re-election instead. Two other competitors, Sarasota developer Carlos Beruff and Orlando defense contractor Todd Wilcox, remain — though Rubio became the instant front-runner.      With his widespread name recognition and broad donor network, Rubio would pose a stiffer challenge to the leading Democratic candidates, U.S. Reps. Patrick Murphy of Jupiter and Alan Grayson of Orlando, who had benefited from the lack of a GOP leader. Rubio’s announcement came within hours of the release of a new Quinnipiac University poll that showed he’s the only Republican with a shot at defeating Grayson or Murphy in November, when the electorate will likely skew Democratic.      Democrats accused Rubio of playing politics with the crucial seat.      Marco Rubio abandoned his constituents, and now he’s treating them like a consolation prize. U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, D-Jupiter      “Marco Rubio abandoned his constituents, and now he’s treating them like a consolation prize,” Murphy said in a statement. “From missing the most votes of any Florida senator in nearly 50 years, to seeking to ban abortion even in cases of rape or incest, to repeatedly voting against closing the terrorist gun loophole, Rubio is proving he is only out for himself.”      Grayson’s campaign manager, Mike Ceraso, in a statement called Rubio “No Show Marco,” a reference to the senator’s many missed votes while on the campaign trail.      Rubio had been adamant after his presidential bid failed that he would not return to Washington, which he has disdained as dysfunctional and ineffective. The 45-year-old seemed intent on a spending a few lucrative years in the private sector.      Yet his reversal is hardly surprising.      Rubio went back to Capitol Hill after his crushing March 15 loss in the Florida primary with renewed interest in the job — and an aggressive public-relations campaign to highlight it. He granted numerous interviews about his work. He traveled extensively in Florida, focusing on issues such as Everglades restoration and Zika prevention. And he repeated over and over again, often unprompted, that he didn’t “hate” the Senate.      Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the National Republican Senatorial Committee took it all as a sign that Rubio might be open to their overtures.      In interviews, Rubio started sounding increasingly like a man sitting out the race chiefly because his friend was in it — not because he wasn’t interested. “Maybe,” he told CNN in May.      Then, after last week’s massacre of 49 people at an Orlando nightclub, Rubio told a radio talk-show host he’d been given “pause” to reconsider his Senate role. He met with Lopez-Cantera, who gave Rubio the go-ahead to run. “Had that conversation not happened,” Rubio said of his talk with Lopez-Cantera, “this conversation we’re having now would have never happened.”      On Monday, Rubio voted against a measure to block gun sales to suspected terrorists.      Democrats charged Rubio with using the mass shooting to neatly justify his political plans. Rubio, who was careful not to mention the tragedy in the Herald interview, said Orlando made him think, “Where is it that you want to be in life, and what do you find rewarding?”      Though Rubio seemed to deliberately position himself so he could seek re-election, he and his friends contend the move was never calculated and the timing wasn’t opportunistic. Until just a couple of weeks ago, they say, Rubio had no intention to return to the Senate. Several friends said when Rubio started reconsidering, they advised him to stick to his original plan.      “He’s got four kids under the age of 16,” said Miami-Dade County Commissioner Esteban “Steve” Bovo, who served with Rubio in the Florida House of Representatives. “Politically it’s probably the riskiest thing he could do.... It’s no shoo-in for Marco.”      He made up his mind with his family over Father’s Day weekend, Rubio said. The senator, who’s always had a knack for building political suspense, extended the drama by taking until Wednesday to make an announcement. His backers had said they expected a decision by Sunday. Then Monday. Then Tuesday.      The prolonged intrigue set off a flurry of political dominoes among Florida Republicans.      U.S. Rep. David Jolly of Indian Shores left the Senate race Friday and will instead seek re-election to his St. Petersburg congressional seat, challenging former Gov. Charlie Crist in a redrawn district that now favors Democrats. DeSantis, of Ponte Vedra Beach, will run again in Florida’s 6th congressional district. Lopez-Cantera, of Miami, will remain lieutenant governor.      He’s doing this for the greater good. Florida Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera      “He’s doing this for the greater good,” Lopez-Cantera said Wednesday. “Before today, I was our best chance to keep the seat Republican. But if Marco runs then he’s our best chance. That’s more important.”      He urged Beruff and Wilcox to leave the race. Beruff and Wilcox, though — who are both independently wealthy — say they’re prepared to challenge Rubio in the primary.      Beruff has indicated he’s prepared to tar Rubio, who was a tea-party favorite when he was first elected to office in 2010, as part of the Republican establishment that many voters now disdain.      “Career politicians like Marco Rubio worry more about keeping the job than doing the job, and are constantly looking for their next political promotion,” Beruff said in a statement Wednesday.      Outside of Beruff and Wilcox, however, Florida GOP leaders and down-ballot candidates were giddy at the prospect of having Rubio back on the ticket. They see Rubio, the only Senate candidate who has run statewide, as a buffer to Trump in Florida. The presumptive GOP nominee has seen his popularity fall in recent polls, and party leaders worry he could be a drag on state and local races.      Clinton leads Trump 47-39 percent in Florida, a Quinnipiac poll released Tuesday showed — her largest lead since the pollster starting asking voters about a Clinton-Trump match-up in 2015.      “I’m very encouraged by the news Sen. Rubio will seek re-election,” said state Rep. Jose Oliva, R-Miami Lakes, who is hoping to become House speaker from 2018-2020. “His decision will have important ramifications on the election and, more importantly, on our ability to appoint a Supreme Court justice who will hold to our Constitution.”      Political groups plan to spend tens of millions of dollars in the Florida Senate race. Rubio will have to start fundraising from scratch. As of the end of May, he had only about 24,000 left over in his presidential campaign account and was about 1.9 million in debt.      But major Republican groups are also expected to step in to help Rubio. That’s part of the promise party leaders made in courting him for re-election.      “There is literally one person in America who has the ability to dramatically increase the chances of Republicans keeping the majority — Marco Rubio,” said Steven Law, president of the Senate Leadership Fund and a former McConnell chief of staff. “If Marco’s in for Florida, we’re in for Florida, it’s just that simple.”      Herald/Times reporters Michael Auslen, Kristen Clark and Jeremy Wallace, and Tampa Bay Times Washington bureau chief Alex Leary, contributed to this report. ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| A poll released Wednesday gives U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., one more reason to run for re-election: He's running ahead of the Democrats.      The Quinnipiac University Poll found Rubio leading Democrat Patrick Murphy, 47 percent to 40 percent. He leads Democrat Alan Grayson 48 percent to 40 percent.      Murphy, a congressman from northern Palm Beach, Martin and St. Lucie counties, is the preferred candidate of Democratic Party leaders, including President Barack Obama. Grayson is an Orlando congressman popular with the liberal wing of the party.      The Quinnipiac poll measured potential November election matchups, not the Aug. 30 primary contests in which Democrats and Republicans will pick their nominees.      The poll found Murphy and Grayson are running well ahead of the candidates for the Republican Senate nomination: Carlos Beruff, a Bradenton home builder; Ron DeSantis, a congressman from Ponte Vedra Beach; Carlos Lopez-Cantera, the state lieutenant governor from Miami-Dade County; and Todd Wilcox, an Orlando businessman.      Republican leaders, including presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump, see Rubio as the party's best hope of holding the U.S. Senate seat in November, when a few state elections will determine which party controls the Senate.      \\"Will Marco come to the rescue of the GOP?\\" asked Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac Poll, in a written analysis of the results. \\"With Republican national leaders worried about keeping control of the U.S. Senate, Sen. Marco Rubio might ride to their rescue ... he could be in the driver's seat.\\"      Rubio's re-election run marks a major political reversal.      For more than a year — starting when he announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination March 2015 — Rubio insisted he wouldn't run for re-election. He said he'd either be headed for the White House or becoming a private citizen.      But three months after he dropped out of the presidential nomination — and faced with a Friday deadline to get on the ballot as a Senate candidate — Rubio announced Wednesday he will run.      The poll found Democrats would overwhelmingly support either Murphy or Grayson and Republicans would overwhelmingly support Rubio. People who identify themselves as independent voters break for Rubio. Independents go for Rubio 47 percent to 39 percent over Murphy and support Rubio 49 percent to 38 percent for Grayson.      Quinnipiac reported that the gender and racial gaps that mark the presidential race in Florida between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are also present in the Senate race, though on a smaller scale.      For example, in a matchup between Republican Rubio and Democrat Murphy, men support Rubio 51 percent to 36 percent. Women are split, with 44 percent for Rubio and 42 percent for Murphy.      White voters favor the Republican, 56 percent to 33 percent; nonwhite voters favor the Democrat, 55 percent to 30 percent.      Quinnipiac said the same is true in a Rubio-Grayson matchup.      Overall, voters' views about whether Rubio should be re-elected haven't changed much since a Feb. 10, 2015, Quinnipiac Poll.      When voters were asked in that survey to look ahead to the 2016 election, 44 percent said Rubio deserved to be re-elected and 37 percent said he didn't deserve re-election.      Approval ratings      Voters are evenly divided over Rubio's performance, with 45 percent approving of his job performance and 44 percent disapproving.      That marks an bit of an improvement for Rubio, whose home state approval rating had dipped during the course of his presidential campaign. During the last 10 months, he went from a net 21 percent positive to 1 percent positive.      In May, Quinnipiac found 42 percent of Florida voters approved of his performance and 49 percent disapproved — putting him in negative territory for the first time since he was elected to the Senate in 2010. In August 2015, home state voters gave him a 57 percent approval rating with 36 percent disapproving.      U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., fares better than Rubio. For Nelson, 55 percent of Florida voters approve of his job performance and 22 percent disapprove.      Gov. Rick Scott has one of his best scores ever, Quinnipiac said, with 43 percent approving of his performance and 46 percent disapproving.      \\"Surprisingly, Republican Gov. Rick Scott also is enjoying some Florida sunshine,\\" Brown said. \\"Scott has spent most of his six years as governor with negative approval ratings. In this survey he is just about even.\\"      And President Barack Obama is enjoying his best numbers since December 2012, the month after he won re-election. Florida voters give him a 54 percent approval rating with 42 percent disapproving of his job performance.      Potential Senate matchups      • Grayson 40, Rubio 48.      • Grayson 40, Beruff 33.      • Grayson 40, Lopez-Cantera 35.      • Grayson 41, DeSantis 33.      • Grayson 39, Wilcox 34.      • Murphy 40, Rubio 47.      • Murphy 43, Beruff 31.      • Murphy 41, Lopez-Cantera 32.      • Murphy 42, DeSantis, 32.      • Murphy 41, Wilcox 31.      Quinnipiac surveyed 975 Florida voters over land lines and cell phones from June 8-19. The margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points for the overall survey; it's higher for smaller groups, such as female voters, because the sample size is smaller. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Ending weeks of political speculation, Marco Rubio announced on Wednesday that he will run for re-election to the U.S. Senate.

In music, sampling is the act of taking a portion, or sample, of one sound recording and reusing it as an instrument or a sound recording in a different song or piece. Sampling was originally developed by experimental musicians working with musique concrete and electroacoustic music, who physically manipulated tape loops or vinyl records on a phonograph. By the late 1960s, the use of tape loop sampling influenced the development of minimalist music and the production of psychedelic rock and jazz fusion. Hip hop music was the first popular music genre based on the art of sampling - being born from 1970s DJs who experimented with manipulating vinyl on two turntables and an audio mixer. Usually taken from movies, television, or other non-musical media, spoken word samples are often used to create atmosphere, to set a mood, or even comic effect. The American composer Steve Reich used samples from interviews with Holocaust survivors as a source for the melodies on the 1988 album Different Trains, performed by the Kronos Quartet.  Many genres utilize sampling of spoken word to induce a mood, and Goa trance often employs samples of people speaking about the use of psychoactives, spirituality, or science fiction themes. Industrial is known for samples from horror/sci-fi movies, news broadcasts, propaganda reels, and speeches by political figures. The band Ministry frequently samples George W. Bush. Paul Hardcastle used recordings of a news reporter, as well as a soldier and ambient noise of a protest, in his single \\"Nineteen,\\" a song about Vietnam war veterans and Posttraumatic stress disorder. The band Negativland samples from practically every form of popular media, ranging from infomercials to children's records. In the song \\"Civil War\\", Guns N' Roses samples from the 1967 film Cool Hand Luke, on the album Use Your Illusion II. Sludge band Dystopia make frequent use of samples, including news clips and recordings of junkies to create a bleak and nihilistic atmosphere.  Other bands that frequently used samples in their work are noise rockers Steel Pole Bath Tub and death metal band Skinless. The extreme metal band Mortician makes extensive usage of horror movie samples, which can sometimes be longer than the actual song itself. The American rapper and producer MF Doom frequently uses spoken word samples, taken from anything from old Spider-Man and Fantastic Four cartoons to Charles Bukowski's \\"Dinosauria, We\\" poem. Oasis used a clip from a John Lennon interview for their song \\"I'm Outta Time\\". Living Colour samples Malcolm X, John F. Kennedy, and Franklin D.

The equation is: -9136018*v + 9136606*v + 6468 = 0 Step 1: Combine the 'v' terms: (9136606 - 9136018)*v + 6468 = 0 This simplifies to: 588*v + 6468 = 0 Step 2: To isolate 'v', we must move the constant term (6468) to the other side of the equation.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"what leader is mentioned first?\\"  Context: \\"Gorbachev also radically expanded the scope of Glasnost, stating that no subject was off-limits for open discussion in the media. Even so, the cautious Soviet intelligentsia took almost a year to begin pushing the boundaries to see if he meant what he said. For the first time, the Communist Party leader had appealed over the heads of Central Committee members for the people's support in exchange for expansion of liberties. The tactic proved successful: Within two years political reform could no longer be sidetracked by Party \\"conservatives.\\" An unintended consequence was that having saved reform, Gorbachev's move ultimately killed the very system it was designed to save.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"In the provided context, the leader mentioned first is Mikhail Gorbachev. As the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and later the President of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev served as the leader of the USSR from 1985 until its dissolution in 1991. Recognized for his transformative policies, Gorbachev implemented key reforms, including \\"Glasnost\\" (openness) and \\"Perestroika\\" (restructuring), which contributed to the end of the Cold War era and the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union. Under Gorbachev's leadership, Glasnost allowed for an unprecedented level of openness and public dialogue on previously sensitive or restricted topics. This policy fostered increased transparency and freedom of speech, which eventually helped break down the long-standing barriers against criticism of the Soviet political system, its leaders, and the Communist Party's historical actions. Initially, the Soviet intelligentsia approached the new atmosphere of openness with caution before eventually pushing the boundaries of permitted dialogue. Gorbachev's ground-breaking tactic of appealing directly to the people for support in exchange for the expansion of liberties had an overall positive impact on advancing political reform in the Soviet Union. However, it also led to unintended consequences, as an increase in public discussion and criticism of the system played a significant role in the weakening and eventual downfall of the Soviet Union. In summary, the first leader mentioned within the context provided is Mikhail Gorbachev, whose radical expansion of the scope of Glasnost ultimately challenged the established norms of the Soviet Union and led to significant societal and political changes. While the reformist policies of Gorbachev inadvertently contributed to the decline of the Soviet system, they also helped to bring about an end to the Cold War era and set the stage for a new chapter in global history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Reyes was arrested in Maui on Oct. 31 after he allegedly beat and shoved his wife, Katherine Ramirez in a hotel room, according to a police report. Ramirez had told police that Reyes grabbed her throat and shoved her through a sliding glass door during an argument in their hotel room. Hotel employees reported that Ramirez had injuries to her neck, wrist and thighs. Reyes pleaded not guilty but the criminal charges were soon dropped after lack of cooperation from Ramirez. He was placed on paid administrative leave by MLB as they conducted their own investigation.

Step 3: Select your toasting method Choose between a toaster, toaster oven, or stovetop with a pan. Each method will yield slightly different results, so it's a matter of personal preference. Step 4: Applying butter (optional) Generously spread a layer of butter or a suitable substitute onto the cut side of the hamburger bun halves, ensuring each surface is covered evenly. This step is optional but recommended, as it adds flavor and improves texture. Toasting Method 1: Toaster 1. Adjust the toasting setting on your toaster to the desired level of crispiness (usually a setting between 3 to 4). 2. Place the bun halves, with the cut-side facing up, in the toaster. 3. Start the toaster and wait for it to complete the toasting process. This should take a few minutes. 4. Carefully remove the bun halves from the toaster, and allow them to cool slightly before handling them. Toasting Method 2: Toaster Oven 1. Preheat your toaster oven to 350°F (175°C). 2. Place the bun halves on a baking sheet or tray, with the cut-side facing up. 3. Place the tray in the preheated toaster oven for around 3-5 minutes, or until they reach your preferred level of browning. 4. Carefully remove the bun halves from the toaster oven, and allow them to cool slightly before handling them. Toasting Method 3: Stovetop with a Pan 1. Preheat a non-stick pan or griddle over medium heat. 2. If you haven't applied butter to the buns, add some butter or oil to the pan to prevent sticking. 3. Place the hamburger bun halves, cut-side down, onto the pan or griddle. 4. Toast the bun halves for 2-4 minutes or until they're golden brown and crispy, adjusting the heat if needed. Keep an eye on them to prevent burning. 5. Once the desired level of browning is achieved, carefully remove the bun halves from the pan, and allow them to cool slightly before handling them. Step 5: Assemble the burger After toasting the hamburger bun, you can continue to assemble your burger by adding your preferred ingredients, like burger patties, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and condiments.

After a day in a Chinese park, Dre develops a crush on a young violinist, Meiying, who reciprocates his attention, but Cheng, a rebellious kung fu prodigy whose family is close to Meiying's, attempts to keep the two young ones apart by violently attacking Dre, and later bullies him at school, as Dre is too weak to stand up for himself. During an attack one day, the maintenance man, Mr. Han, comes to Dre's aid, revealing himself as an ancient kung fu master. After Han mends Dre's injuries using fire cupping, Dre asks if Mr. Han could teach him kung fu to get revenge on his attackers. Han refuses, but meets Cheng's teacher, Master Li, to make peace.

When we review the available options, our task is to pick the one that aligns most logically with the task of designing and constructing a terrace.  Let's evaluate each option: 1) Rice Paddy: A rice paddy would not be an appropriate choice because it refers to a type of agricultural field where rice is grown. This is very distinct from the process of designing and creating a terrace. 2) Financial Firm: Financial firms offer services related to money management, investments, and financial planning. These establishments do not engage in physical construction or architectural design.  3) Architecture Firm: An architectural firm designs and creates plans for structures like buildings, homes, and also landscaping, which includes terraces. They have the knowledge, skills, and tools to produce aesthetic and functional designs. This corresponds directly with the description in the question of a \\"terrace [that] was ornate and artfully laid out.\\" 4) Michigan: Michigan is a state in the United States. While it might host various types of firms (including architectural ones), as a geographical location it does not bear direct relevance to the act of creating a terrace. 5) House: House here seems to refer to a residential building, rather than a type of firm. A house cannot create a terrace; rather, it could possess a terrace if it was constructed or remodeled by builders, likely working under the design guidance of an architecture firm. Given these considerations, a human would choose \\"architecture\\" as the answer because an architecture firm is the most reasonable and logical choice. The design and creation of a terrace—an ornate and artfully laid out one in particular—align with the core competencies and functions of an architecture firm.

There was a huge corporation in which I had a contract with. I was called in, to help them uncover what they considered “a very serious series of incidents”. Their own “in house” attempts were fruitless. It turned out, they had an over-sized engineering department, and that it had been announced that this would be scaled back due to completion of contracts. Someone though, within the engineering department, was sabotaging the continued work, slowing the completion. I was to go undercover, posing as a visiting engineer from a distant plant, and find out who the perpetrator/s were, as they wished to file legal action. So, this is at the corporate headquarters, in the late 1980’s. These people were making 6 figure incomes easily. That being said, you kind of expect a bit more of a dignified behavior here than you would with a construction laborer or dishwasher. I completed my job in four days, giving them the evidence and name of the lone individual respsonsible for the sabotage. What exactly was he doing? He carried rubber gloves in his back pocket, and he would periodically use the restroom, and remove his feces from the toilet and smear it all over the walls, covering as much surface as he could. He would also visit restrooms in different departments and do the same. This would cause the unionized individuals, who only had that restroom to use in their area, to walk off their work stations.

These tools collect data about the weather. You can see some of the common tools listed below: A thermometer measures temperature. An anemometer measures wind speed. A rain gauge measures the amount of rain. A hygrometer measures humidity. A wind vane shows wind direction. A snow gauge measures the amount of snow.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What can data tell us?\\" is \\"Everything we want to know\\"?","output":"Data can provide us with valuable insights and information about a wide range of topics, including weather as mentioned in the paragraph. It is not entirely accurate to say that data can tell us \\"Everything we want to know,\\" as there will always be certain limitations and unknowns in any field of study or inquiry. However, data is critical in helping us understand, analyze, and make informed decisions based on the available information. In the context of weather, data gathered from various tools such as thermometers, anemometers, rain gauges, hygrometers, wind vanes, and snow gauges helps meteorologists to understand and predict weather patterns, plan for natural disasters, and make recommendations to the public about potential hazards or precautions to take. Access to accurate and timely weather data can be vital for agriculture, aviation, shipping, outdoor events, and public safety. Moreover, data can also be a valuable asset in numerous other fields, such as healthcare, finance, education, sports, and transportation. With advancements in technology, we can now collect, process, and analyze vast amounts of data, which has given rise to the field of data science and opened up numerous possibilities for organizations and individuals to gain insights and better understand complex patterns. However, it is essential to recognize that data on its own is not sufficient; we need skilled professionals who can clean, process, interpret, and analyze data from various sources. Furthermore, it's crucial to have appropriate context and understanding while interpreting data, as it can often be misleading or misinterpreted if not handled with care. Privacy concerns and ethical issues are other considerations that need to be addressed while collecting, storing, and using data. In conclusion, data is an essential tool that can reveal a wealth of information and help us better understand various aspects of the world around us.

Jessica  worked zero jobs.; b. Patricia  worked zero jobs.;","output":"b. Patricia worked zero jobs. Jessica had to pay a lot in taxes unlike Patricia because Patricia worked zero jobs. This sentence highlights the difference in the financial situations and tax burdens faced by the two individuals due to their respective work statuses.  Taxes play a crucial role in any country's economy, as they provide the government with the necessary funding required for public services and infrastructure development. The amount of taxes an individual has to pay generally depends on their income and a range of other factors. In this instance, Jessica presumably has a steady income, either from one or multiple jobs, and thus must pay taxes according to her income bracket.  On the other hand, Patricia does not have any jobs, and her income might consist of savings, financial investments, or informal work not yielding significant revenues. This lack of regular employment reduces her overall income, placing her in a lower tax bracket or potentially allowing her to be exempt from paying income taxes altogether. It is important to note that there are various aspects to individual taxation, such as deductions and credits, which can also impact the amount a person owes. Moreover, the taxation system typically incorporates progressive rates, meaning that higher earners are subject to higher tax rates.
