Constructed of a bright yellow material, the web is distinctive in that it is embellished with a complex spiral structure, effectively creating a bullseye pattern.

The vehicle was tested on a closed track and managed to surpass the previous record by over 200 miles. The company hopes to launch the car in the near future.","output":"A new electric car has just broken the world record for the longest distance traveled on a single battery charge, surpassing the previous record by more than 200 miles. The vehicle, which has yet to be named, was tested on a closed track, where it managed to cover over 1,000 miles before running out of juice. The previous record for an electric car was set at 830 miles, which was achieved by a Japanese-built vehicle in 2019. The new record-breaking electric car was designed and built by a startup based in California, USA. The company's CEO said that the aim of the project was to showcase the power and potential of electric cars to the wider world. He also stated that the car is not yet ready for public release, as there are still some technical kinks to iron out. However, the company hopes to launch the car in the near future, possibly within the next year. The vehicle is powered by a unique battery system that the company has been developing for several years. The high-performance batteries are both lightweight and highly efficient, allowing the car to travel longer distances without needing to be recharged. The company says that the batteries are also designed to last longer than traditional lithium-ion batteries, which will make them more cost-effective for consumers in the long run. The test drive was conducted over several days, during which the car was carefully monitored by a team of engineers and technicians. The vehicle was driven at a consistent speed of around 20 miles per hour, which helped to conserve the battery's charge. However, the company claims that the car could travel much faster if necessary, while still achieving a considerable distance on a single charge. The news of the new record-breaking electric car has been met with widespread praise from environmental groups and renewable energy advocates. They see the vehicle as a significant step forward in the quest to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change. However, some industry experts have pointed out that the car's extreme range may not be practical for everyday use, as most drivers do not need to travel such long distances on a regular basis. Nevertheless, the new electric car is a testament to the rapid developments that are taking place in the field of electric vehicle technology. As battery technology continues to improve and costs come down, it seems likely that we will see more and more electric cars on our roads in the coming years.

The study, conducted at the University of Cambridge, looked at data from over 1.2 million adults in the United States over a period of several years. The results were clear: those who exercised regularly reported better mental health outcomes than those who did not. Specifically, individuals who exercised for at least 30 minutes per day, five days per week, reported fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety than those who did not meet these guidelines. The researchers also found that the type of exercise did not necessarily matter. Both aerobic exercise, such as running or cycling, and strength training, such as weightlifting, were associated with improved mental health outcomes. What is especially encouraging about these findings is that the benefits appeared to be consistent across all age groups, genders, and socioeconomic backgrounds. This suggests that exercise may be a helpful tool for improving mental health for a wide range of people. The study does have some limitations, however. Firstly, the participants self-reported their exercise habits and mental health symptoms, which may not be entirely accurate. Additionally, it is unclear whether exercise was the direct cause of improved mental health outcomes or whether other factors, such as social support or a healthy diet, played a role. Nonetheless, the study provides strong evidence that exercise is an important component of overall mental health and wellbeing. If you are struggling with mental health issues, incorporating regular exercise into your daily routine may be a helpful step towards feeling better.

The distance from the rose to the poppy is 8 meters less than the distance from the daisy to the rose, so it is ( 26 - 8 = 18 ) meters.

Its axis of symmetry is at x=1, so the maximum value of f(x) must be obtained either at x=3 or at x=1. (1) When the maximum value is obtained at x=3, we have f(3)=|3^{2}-2times3-t|=2, solving this gives t=1 or 5, when t=5, we have f(0)=5 > 2, which does not meet the condition, when t=1, we have f(0)=1, f(1)=2, which meets the condition.

So this becomes: Ratio = (0.20M / 50) * (50 / 0.80M) The M's cancel out, and the 50's cancel out, leaving us with: Ratio = 0.20 / 0.80 Ratio = 1 / 4 So the ratio of the migration rate for male geese to the migration rate for female geese is boxed{1:4} ."},{"instruction":"the following multiplication schemes, each letter represents a digit, with the condition that the same letter always represents the same digit.

If ( T ) is the foot from ( S ) to ( A_1B_1 ), then ( HT = rho ) and ( ST = R + rho ). Since ( TC' = q ), we have ( HC' = sqrt{rho^2 + q^2} ). 3. **Circumradius of ( triangle A'B'C' ):** By analogous reasoning, we get the same expression for ( HA' ) and ( HB' ).

Therefore, we have: [M = max{a + b, b + c, c + d, d + e}.] Given that a, b, c, d, and e are positive integers and their sum is 2010, we can infer several inequalities: 1. Since a + b le M, b + c le M, and d + e le M, and knowing that b is a positive integer, it implies that c must be less than M. This is because if c were equal to or greater than M, then b+c would exceed M, contradicting the definition of M. 2. With the above in mind, we can add these inequalities together to find a relationship involving M and the total sum of a+b+c+d+e: [(a + b) + c + (d + e) < 3M.] 3. Substituting the given total sum of 2010 for a+b+c+d+e, we get: [2010 < 3M.] 4. Dividing both sides of the inequality by 3 gives us: [670 < M.] 5. Since M must be an integer, and it cannot be 670 (as it is strictly less than M), the smallest possible integer value for M that satisfies this inequality is 671. Therefore, the smallest possible value of M is boxed{671}, which occurs when we choose values for a, b, c, d, and e such that one of the sums equals 671, specifically by setting a = 669, b = 1, c = 670, d = 1, and e = 669.

Asignación manual (IP estática): En este caso, el administrador de la red configura manualmente la dirección IP en la configuración de red de la computadora. La dirección IP se establece de forma permanente y no cambia a menos que se realice una modificación manual. 2. Asignación automática (IP dinámica): Aquí, la dirección IP se asigna de forma automática a través de un servidor DHCP (Protocolo de configuración dinámica de host). El servidor DHCP asigna una dirección IP disponible de un rango predefinido cada vez que la computadora se conecta a la red. Esto es común en redes domésticas y empresariales. 3. Asignación por dirección MAC (IP reservada): Con esta metodología, se asocia una dirección IP específica con la dirección MAC única de una tarjeta de red de la computadora. Esto se configura en el servidor DHCP de la red y garantiza que la misma dirección IP sea asignada siempre a esa computadora en particular. 4. Asignación por PPP (Protocolo Punto a Punto): En algunas conexiones de Internet, como las conexiones de banda ancha mediante módems o líneas telefónicas, se utiliza el protocolo PPP para establecer la conexión. En este caso, el ISP (Proveedor de servicios de Internet) asigna una dirección IP a través del protocolo PPP.

Su principal objetivo es proporcionar una transmisión confiable de datos a través de una red, estableciendo y manteniendo una conexión entre dos dispositivos. TCP es un protocolo orientado a la conexión, lo que significa que antes de que los dispositivos puedan intercambiar datos, deben establecer una conexión lógica y confiable entre ellos. Para establecer esta conexión, TCP utiliza un proceso llamado \\"handshake de tres vías\\" que consiste en una serie de mensajes de control entre el cliente y el servidor. Una vez establecida la conexión, TCP divide los datos en segmentos y los envía a través de la red en paquetes separados. Cada paquete contiene información de control, como números de secuencia, que permiten al receptor ensamblar correctamente los segmentos recibidos en el orden correcto. TCP también se encarga de asegurar que los datos se entreguen de manera confiable. Esto implica el seguimiento de los paquetes enviados y recibidos, la retransmisión de paquetes perdidos o dañados, y el control del flujo de datos para garantizar que el receptor no se vea abrumado con más datos de los que puede manejar. En resumen, el protocolo TCP es esencial para la transmisión confiable de datos a través de redes de computadoras. Proporciona una conexión estable y confiable entre dispositivos y se encarga de dividir y ensamblar los datos en paquetes, así como de asegurar su entrega y controlar el flujo de la transmisión."},{"instruction":"En qué consiste el protocolo ip","output":"El protocolo IP (Internet Protocol) es un protocolo de comunicación utilizado en redes de computadoras para el enrutamiento y entrega de paquetes de datos. Es parte fundamental de la capa de red en el modelo OSI y permite la interconexión de redes diferentes. El protocolo IP se encarga de asignar direcciones IP a los dispositivos conectados a una red, lo que facilita la identificación y el direccionamiento de los mismos. Cada dispositivo que se conecta a Internet tiene asignada una dirección IP única que permite su ubicación en la red. El protocolo IP también se encarga de fragmentar y ensamblar los datos en paquetes, antes de enviarlos a través de la red. Cada paquete contiene la dirección IP de origen y la dirección IP de destino, lo que permite que los routers y otros dispositivos de red puedan enrutar los paquetes hacia su destino correcto. Además, el protocolo IP es independiente de los medios físicos utilizados en la red, lo que significa que puede ser utilizado en redes Ethernet, Wi-Fi, líneas telefónicas, entre otros. Esto asegura que los dispositivos puedan comunicarse y enviar/recibir información en diferentes tipos de redes. En resumen, el protocolo IP es esencial en la comunicación de redes de computadoras.

Aquí tienes las principales diferencias entre IPv4 e IPv6: 1. Estructura de direcciones: - IPv4: Utiliza una estructura de direcciones de 32 bits, representada por cuatro números decimales separados por puntos (por ejemplo, 192.168.0.1). Permite aproximadamente 4.3 mil millones de direcciones únicas. - IPv6: Utiliza una estructura de direcciones de 128 bits, representada por ocho grupos hexadecimales separados por dos puntos (por ejemplo, 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334). Permite un número extremadamente grande de direcciones únicas, aproximadamente 3.4 × 10^38 posibles direcciones. 2. Capacidad de direcciones: - IPv4: Debido al número limitado de direcciones disponibles, IPv4 ha llevado a la escasez de direcciones IP en todo el mundo. Para ayudar a superar esto, se han utilizado técnicas como la asignación dinámica de direcciones (DHCP) y la traducción de direcciones de red (NAT). - IPv6: Con su vasta cantidad de direcciones, IPv6 resuelve el problema de la escasez de direcciones IPv4. Proporciona direcciones suficientes para todos los dispositivos en la actualidad y en el futuro previsible, lo que evita la necesidad de NAT y permite una asignación global y permanente de direcciones IP. 3. Soporte para características adicionales: - IPv4: Proporciona servicios básicos como el enrutamiento y la entrega de paquetes, pero no incluye características avanzadas de seguridad y administración de tráfico de red. Se han agregado extensiones y mejoras a IPv4 para proporcionar algunas de estas características adicionales, como IPSec para seguridad en la capa de red. - IPv6: Incluye características adicionales, como el soporte nativo para IPSec (para seguridad de extremo a extremo), autoconfiguración de direcciones, movilidad de dispositivos y calidad de servicio (QoS) mejorada. En general, IPv6 fue diseñado para reemplazar a IPv4 y abordar las limitaciones del mismo, especialmente en términos de capacidad de direcciones. Sin embargo, la transición completa de IPv4 a IPv6 ha sido gradual debido a la amplia adopción y compatibilidad existente con IPv4 en aplicaciones, sistemas operativos y dispositivos de red."},{"instruction":"Clases de direcciónes ipv4, sus usos, sus rengos y su empleo de casa uno de sus octetos-clase A-clase B-clase C-clase D-clase Ex","output":"Las clases de direcciones IPv4 se utilizaban anteriormente para clasificar las direcciones IP en función de su propósito y tamaño de red. Sin embargo, con el agotamiento de las direcciones IPv4, la asignación basada en clases ha quedado en gran medida obsoleta. Aún así, aquí te presento una descripción general de cada clase: 1. Clase A: - Rango de dirección: El primer octeto (8 bits) representa la red y los tres últimos octetos (24 bits) representan el host. - Uso previsto: Diseñada para redes grandes y corporaciones. - Rango de dirección: 0.0.0.0 a 127.255.255.255 - Ejemplo: 10.0.0.0, 127.0.0.1 2.

By now we know that business activities such as stra- tegic planning are essential for gaining competitive advantages, but why is brand management important? What has changed in our media environment that makes a traditional consumer goods management tool and construct applicable to media products? In principle, the most essential driver for a branding strategy is the ele- ment of “competition” in a market. When consumers are faced with choices in products, they need a way to identify the one that will best sat- isfy their needs, so suppliers must create identities for their offerings to avoid confusion and reach the target consumers in the marketplace. The tremendous proliferation of media outlets and the continuous fragmen- tation of audiences during the last two decades have created an increas- ingly competitive media marketplace. The same element of “competition” that propelled the introduction of branding practices in consumer goods industries is now facilitating the application of brand management in many media industries as media firms race to establish clear and memo- rable brand images in a growingly complicated marketplace filled with infinite content offered by broadcasters, cablecasters, Internet, telcos, and DBS. In fact, the branding process is consistent with the “experience good” characteristic of media products: It is difficult for consumers to es- timate the quality of a new media product such as movies or television se- ries before they actually experience it. In order to avoid risks (e.g., money and time) related to purchasing and consuming these products, consum- ers may depend on brands and their associated images and expectations as one of the initial decision factors (Chang, 2004). WHAT IS BRANDING? Fundamentally, a brand is a name, term, sign, symbol, package design, or combination of these elements intended to identify and distinguish a product or service from its competitors. A “brand” is different from a “product” because, although it is designed to satisfy the same basic need as an unbranded product, it also adds certain rational, tangible and/or emotional, intangible attributes to a product so it is perceived to be dif- ferent from an unbranded product in its expected performance and ben- efits. In essence, these brand-related elements are supposed to communicate thoughts and feelings that enhance the value of a product beyond its product category and basic functional value. For instance, the brand New York Times represents a certain level of news reporting and editorial quality that distinguishes it from its competitors. Why are brands valuable? Keller (1998) succinctly listed a number of reasons why brands matter to both consumers and producers. He sug- gested that brands help consumers identify the source of a product, as- sign responsibility to product makers, reduce risk and search cost, signal quality, form relationships between consumers and product makers, and serve as a symbolic device. Brands also provide producers a means of identification to simplify handling or tracing, a way to legally protect unique features, a tool to signal “quality” levels, a means to endow prod- ucts with special associations, and a source of competitive advantages and thus the final financial returns. All of these benefits are applicable in the context of media products. For example, the brand name “PBS” is strongly associated with the images of “trust” and “quality” in the mind of television audiences (Chan-Olmsted & Y. Kim, 2002). The brand name “Discovery” has been used by its corporate owner in the introduction of various new cable channels and even retail learning products. There are various strategic aspects that a firm can pursue to engage competitors: marketing, production, financial, technological, and man- agerial. Whereas the topics in strategic management discussed in earlier chapters mainly dealt with managerial competition strategies, the de- velopment and maintenance of brands are traditionally a part of a mar- keting program. Because a brand is built over time, branding is also a continuous process of marketing activities that should be designed to reflect the changing life cycle of a product and its environment. Various marketing researchers have tried to explain the nature of brands and branding activities. Donahue (1995) suggested that a valuable brand has to be relevant and distinctive and brand-building activities may in- clude demonstrations, seminars, shows, effective service material, pub- lic relations, advertising, direct marketing, and promotions that extend positioning. Murphy (1987) indicated that branding consists of the de- velopment and maintenance of sets of product attributes and values that are coherent, appropriate, distinctive, protectable, and appealing to consumers. Cowley (1991) also stated that sources of added value in branding include a guarantee of authenticity, the promise of perfor- mance, the value of reassurance, and the transformation of experience (the subjective experience of using a brand, and differentiation or brand personality). The value of authenticity and promise of positive experi- ence seem to be especially important for media content providers in an increasingly crowded marketplace. In fact, Davis (1995) suggested that brand management should be viewed as a strategic management pro- cess to maximize the long-term value of a brand. The role of branding is often misunderstood by companies that have not had a traditional mar- keting focus. Many companies hire senior-level packaged goods mar- keters and expect quick fixes (Bissell, 1998). Branding is seen simply as a new “design and control” function to quickly clean up corporate iden- tity and wrap an existing product or service into a nice, neat package. Bissell reiterated the importance of management commitment in treat- ing branding as part of a firm’s fundamental strategic process and daily tactical operations. On the surface, the branding and brand management notions ap- pear to be less applicable to media industries due to many media prod- ucts’ intangible, nonpreservable nature, the possibility of group consumption, the selection of a content product based on the merits of individual units (e.g., movies), the lack of actual purchasing action (and risk) for advertising-supported content products, and the absence of easily identifiable product logos. In addition, prior to the 1990s, most media markets were relatively uncompetitive; media products were based on distinct technologies consumed in separate markets with distinctive consumer behaviors (McDowell, 2006). Nevertheless, the landscape of media industries has changed dramatically. We now have a converging media marketplace enabled by digital technologies and new network conduits such as the Internet; the potential for pro- viding additional new media services; and a fragmented, multitasking audience. These environmental developments present an unprece- dented need for differentiation using all possible means. With varying degrees, branding or brand management can enhance a media con- sumer’s association, perception, and expectation of a media product. For example, a radio station that has established a family-friendly brand may increase its chance of being selected by a certain segment of the audience. And a signature local news program can easily become a proprietary brand asset for a TV station. Although branding offers media firms opportunities for differentia- tion, the aforementioned media characteristics still present some chal- lenges in this process. In addition, there are general obstacles associated with the branding approach. For example, the essence of branding as de- veloping something of value often conflicts with the current accounting system, which treats a brand as an expense rather than asset. The neces- sary long-term orientation of brand building also conflicts with the gen- erally high personnel turnover in businesses. Finally, the integrated nature of brand building (i.e., the involvement of production, sales, mar- keting, etc.) often conflicts with the reality of a segmented organizational structure and single-dimension advertising focuses (Kapferer, 1992). BRAND MANAGEMENT CONCEPTS Brand management has become a major subfield within the marketing discipline over the years, infusing it with various theoretical constructs and analytical frameworks. Many of these conceptual building blocks are useful for analyzing media products and thus are reviewed next. Brand Identity Brand identity encompasses two dimensions: one that indicates the out- ward expression of a brand, including the tangible elements such as names, symbols, logos, slogans, and packaging that can be used to rec- ognize a brand; and the other that symbolizes the brand’s differentiated characteristics, including the unique set of associations that represent what the brand stands for and would do for customers. The process is the linking of differentiated features and attributes of a product or ser- vice to anticipated perceived benefits based on customers’ values and be- liefs. In a way, brand identity is like clothing to a product in that it can set one apart in a crowd as well as say something about the person who chooses the brand. It is important to note that brand identity is some- thing that is formulated and worked on by the firm, whereas another relevant concept, brand image, is based on consumer perception (i.e., formulated by the consumer). In other words, image is the result of how consumers interpret the brand identity put forth by a firm, amid noises and personal circumstances. Time can also change the identity of a brand as it gradually acquires other meanings from associations with things that are both intended and unintended by its firm. So how does a firm successfully develop a brand identity for a prod- uct? Kapferer (1992) suggested that brand identities should be formu- lated on the basis of three qualities: durability, coherence, and realism (as opposed to idealism or opportunism). Keller (1998) listed five criteria in choosing brand elements to form a brand identity: memorability, meaningfulness, transferability (both culturally and geographically), adaptability, and protectability (both legally and competitively). Cable networks offer some excellent examples of establishing and modifying a media brand over time. For example, Discovery Communications Inc.’s TLC channel began as an education network that offered foreign-lan- guage instruction, an SAT review course, and other adult personal-en- richment series with the name of “The Learning Channel” (Eastman, 1993). With the success of its reality-based series such as Trading Spaces and its continuous programming transformation to this particular genre, it is now renamed as “TLC” with a “Life Unscripted” slogan and logo. Finally, a firm may look to various sources to define a brand’s identity. Kapferer also suggested some sources of identities: (a) the ac- tual product or service through which the brand may display its uniqueness (e.g., NASA Television), (b) a brand name through which the brand may convey its characteristics (e.g., The Cartoon Network), (c) brand characters and symbols through which the brand may represent its traits and features in the etymological sense (e.g., PBS and its logo), (d) trademarks and logos through which a brand may reflect its person- ality and value (e.g., Playboy TV Networks), (e) geographical and his- torical roots through which a brand may paint its individuality and competence (e.g., BBC America cable channel), and (f) advertising through which a brand may develop or reinvent identities as conceived by its firm (e.g., TLC cable channel). Brand Knowledge: Awareness, Association, and Image Although a brand identity may be the strategic goal for a brand, the re- sultant brand image of what actually resides in the minds of consumers about the brand could be very different from that goal. According to Keller (1998), such a discrepancy is due to the differential brand knowl- edge structures of individual consumers as reflected by the levels of brand awareness and brand image (i.e., the strength, favorability, and uniqueness of brand associations) of that product. Creating “brand awareness” is often considered the first step of branding. Brand awareness can be defined as the degree to which a tar- get audience is able to identify a brand among others and even recall its promise. As a typical measure of marketing communications effective- ness, awareness may be assessed unaidedly or aidedly (i.e., when a brand name is recognized among others that are listed or identified). Conceptually, brand awareness is hierarchical. Keller (1993) suggested that brand awareness consists of brand recognition, which communi- cates consumers’ ability to verify prior exposure to the brand when given the brand as a cue, and brand recall, which relates consumers’ ability to retrieve the brand from memory when given cues such as ben- efits, usage/purchase situations, or product categories. Another related concept is “top-of-the-mind” awareness, which denotes the highest level of brand awareness for a brand because the brand is the first to come to mind when consumers recall a brand relating to a certain qual- ity. It is evident that brand awareness is fundamental to a brand’s suc- cess. For example, by increasing the brand awareness of HBO On Demand (a video-on-demand programming service offered by HBO), HBO raises the potential that an audience might include this service in his or her viewing consideration list. By increasing the brand awareness of Movielink.Com (a broadband movie download service), Movielink raises the probability that an audience might choose this service because it is perceived to be more established and familiar. This power of aware- ness is especially significant for new media products that consumers have not experienced or have no prior knowledge to relate to. Finally, by increasing the brand awareness of Bravo Cable Network, its owner, NBC, would have an easier time cultivating the associations that make up Bravo’s brand image. As indicated previously, brand image rests in the consumers’ minds and is developed through brand associations. Consequently, brand im- age may be defined as a unique set of associations within the target cus- tomers’ minds that characterizes what the brand stands for and implies the brand’s promise to them. For users of the brand, the image is also in- fluenced by their experience with the brand. For nonusers, the image is largely shaped by their impressions of the brand amid personal beliefs and attitudes. Keller (1998) identified three main types of brand associa- tions with increasing abstraction: attributes (product related or nonproduct related such as price and usage imagery), benefits (func- tional, symbolic, or experiential), and attitudes formed on the basis of beliefs about a product’s attributes and benefits. Note that a brand im- age is influenced not only by the types of associations but also by the strength, uniqueness, and favorability of the associations (Keller, 1998). For instance, Fox News has established relatively strong and unique brand associations based on certain attributes and benefits (e.g., conser- vative commentaries such as the O’Reilly Factor program). The value of its brand image, however, is largely dependent on an audience seg- ment’s favorability or desirability toward those associations.","output":"Moving from strategic management to \\"brands,\\" this chapter discusses the importance of brand management in media industries. The increasing competition in the media marketplace requires media firms to establish clear and memorable brand images. Brands help consumers identify products, reduce risk, and signal quality. Brands also provide a means of identification and a source of competitive advantage for producers. Despite the challenges associated with intangible and nonpreservable media products, branding can enhance a consumer's association and perception of a media product. Branding activities should be formulated to reflect the changing life cycle of a product and its environment. Brand identity encompasses the tangible and intangible elements that distinguish a brand, while brand image is based on consumer perception. Creating brand awareness is the first step in branding and consists of brand recognition and recall. Brand image is developed through brand associations, including attributes, benefits, and attitudes. The strength, uniqueness, and favorability of these associations contribute to the brand image. As the media landscape has changed, branding has become increasingly important for media firms to differentiate themselves and attract consumers."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Natsuki, are you okay?” (Natsuki grips her belly tightly as another contraction hits her.)

Но знаете ли, это не страшно! Ведь сам Конфуций, китайский мыслитель далеких времен (а точнее, 551-479 годы до нашей эры), подарил нам мудрость, которая проста, как счастливая улыбка старинного мудреца: \\"Человек, совершивший ошибку и не исправивший ее, совершает еще одну ошибку.\\" Давайте расшифруем эту загадку. Ведь это не просто набор слов, а карта дороги, что ведет к лучшей жизни. Представьте себе: вы шли по дороге и споткнулись о камень. Встали и пошли дальше, а камень оставили. Ну и что? Потом вы опять идете по этому же маршруту – и опять споткнулись. Вот теперь понятно, верно? Если вы в первый раз убрали бы камень с дороги, то повторной ошибки бы не было. Конфуций говорил о том же, только применительно не к камню, а к жизненным ситуациям. Ошибся – признай и исправь. Так ты избежишь повторения. Не заметишь своего промаха – будешь спотыкаться снова и снова. Помните, в любой ошибке есть сила будущих побед, но только если в каждой из них мы найдем урок. И то, сколько раз мы упадем, не столь важно, как количество раз, когда мы встаем и идем дальше, но уже мудрее.

Для упрощения предполагаем, что пользователь вводит целые числа и использует точку в качестве разделителя десятичной части (если вам нужно использовать запятую в качестве разделителя, следует учесть локализацию или строки вводить и обрабатывать отдельно). \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <string> #include <sstream> // Функция для проверки корректности строки как числа с плавающей точкой double getValidatedInput() { std::string input; double value; while (true) { std::getline(std::cin, input); // Считываем строку с вводом пользователя // Попытка преобразовать строку в число std::stringstream stream(input); if (stream >> value) { char remaining; if (!(stream >> remaining)) { // Убедимся, что после числа нет других символов break; // Ввод корректен, выходим из цикла } } // Если ввод некорректен, выводим сообщение об ошибке и просим ввести число еще раз std::cout << \\"Введен некорректный символ, попробуйте снова: \\"; } return value; // Возвращаем корректное число, введенное пользователем } int main() { std::cout << \\"Введите три числа для сложения.\\" << std::endl; // Запрашиваем у пользователя три значения std::cout << \\"Введите первое число: \\"; double value1 = getValidatedInput(); std::cout << \\"Введите второе число: \\"; double value2 = getValidatedInput(); std::cout << \\"Введите третье число: \\"; double value3 = getValidatedInput(); // Выполняем сложение double sum = value1 + value2 + value3; // Выводим результат std::cout << \\"Сумма чисел: \\" << sum << std::endl; return 0; } \`\`\` Функция \`getValidatedInput\` бесконечно запрашивает ввод, пока пользователь не введет корректное значение. Здесь использование \`stringstream\` помогает нам корректно преобразовать строку в число и проверить, что после числа нет остаточных символов (за исключением пробелов, которые игнорируются потоком). Если есть лишние символы после числа, функция считает ввод некорректным и продолжает запрос ввода. После того как пользователь введет три корректных числа, программа выполняет их сложение и выводит результат."},{"instruction":"Ка теперь добавить возможность что после окончания программы предлагалось решить заново или закончить программу","output":"Чтобы добавить возможность повторить решение или закончить программу, мы можем обернуть основной функционал (запрос ввода и сложение чисел) в ещё один цикл и после выполнения этих действий спросить у пользователя, хочет ли он решить заново. Вот пример кода, который реализует это поведение: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <string> #include <sstream> double getValidatedInput() { std::string input; double value; while (true) { std::getline(std::cin, input); std::stringstream stream(input); if (stream >> value) { char remaining; if (!(stream >> remaining)) { break; } } std::cout << \\"Введен некорректный символ, попробуйте снова: \\"; } return value; } int main() { char choice; // Переменная для хранения выбора пользователя do { std::cout << \\"Введите три числа для сложения.\\" << std::endl; std::cout << \\"Введите первое число: \\"; double value1 = getValidatedInput(); std::cout << \\"Введите второе число: \\"; double value2 = getValidatedInput(); std::cout << \\"Введите третье число: \\"; double value3 = getValidatedInput(); double sum = value1 + value2 + value3; std::cout << \\"Сумма чисел: \\" << sum << std::endl; // Предложение выполнить повторное решение std::cout << \\"Хотите ли решить заново? (Y/N): \\"; std::cin >> choice; std::cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits<std::streamsize>::max(), 'n'); // Очистка входного потока // Выполняем цикл до тех пор, пока пользователь не введет 'N' или 'n' } while (choice == 'Y' || choice == 'y'); std::cout << \\"Программа завершена.\\" << std::endl; return 0; } \`\`\` После вывода суммы чисел программа спрашивает пользователя, хочет ли он решить задачу заново, и ожидает ввода \`Y\` (yes) для повтора или \`N\` (no) для завершения программы. Цикл \`do-while\` используется для повторения всего процесса, пока пользователь не решит выйти. Команда \`std::cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits<std::streamsize>::max(), 'n');\` необходима для очистки входного потока от оставшегося символа новой строки, который был бы в противном случае считан при следующем вызове \`std::getline\`."},{"instruction":"Как сделать чтобы консоль очищалась до оператора do","output":"Для очистки консоли в C++ нет стандартного кроссплатформенного способа, так как это операция, зависящая от операционной системы. Однако, вы можете использовать системные вызовы для Linux, macOS или Windows, чтобы вызвать команду очистки консоли. Для Windows это будет команда \`cls\`, а для Unix-подобных систем (Linux/macOS) — \`clear\`. Пример использования: \`\`\`cpp #include <cstdlib> // Для system() // ... int main() { // ... do { // Очистка консоли. Разные команды для разных ОС #if defined(_WIN32) || defined(_WIN64) system(\\"cls\\"); #else system(\\"clear\\"); #endif // Остальной код программы } while (choice == 'Y' || choice == 'y'); // ... } \`\`\` Использование \`system\` имеет недостатки: это может быть опасно, если ввод пользователя по каким-то причинам передается в \`system\`, также это может привести к понижению производительности из-за создания нового процесса. Но для простых учебных целей и небольших программ это может быть приемлемым решением. Обратите внимание: системные вызовы \`cls\` или \`clear\` могут не работать в некоторых IDE, например, в среде разработки, встроенной в онлайн компиляторы или некоторые текстовые редакторы. В таких случаях консоль очищена не будет."},{"instruction":"а как удалять только определенную строку в консоли","output":"Удалить определенную строку в консоли непросто и часто невозможно без использования дополнительных библиотек, таких как ncurses для Unix-подобных систем или соответствующих API для Windows, таких как Windows Console API. Стандартные потоки ввода/вывода в C++ не предоставляют способа для такого управления консолью. Однако если ваша цель — перезаписать последнюю строку вывода, то это можно сделать отправив специальные символы каретки возврата или вертикальной табуляции. Вот пример того, как можно \\"удалить\\" последнюю строку, отправив каретку возврата ('r') и перезаписав её пробелами, а затем снова отправить каретку возврата: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <string> #include <chrono> #include <thread> int main() { // Выводим строку и ждем немного std::cout << \\"Это строка будет 'удалена' через 2 секунды\\" << std::flush; std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(2)); // Переводим курсор на начало строки std::cout << 'r'; // \\"Удаляем\\" строку, перезаписывая её пробелами for (int i = 0; i < 50; ++i) { std::cout << ' '; } // Снова переводим курсор на начало строки std::cout << 'r' << std::flush; // Теперь можете напечатать что-то другое std::cout << \\"Новый текст на месте старой строки.\\" << std::endl; return 0; } \`\`\` Важно отметить, что этот метод \\"удаляет\\" только последнюю строку и делает это перезаписью её пробелами. Для удаления строк, которые находятся не в конце вывода, потребуются более продвинутые методы. Для сложных задач управления содержимым терминала может потребоваться использование библиотеки ncurses (на Unix-подобных системах) или аналогичных инструментов. Как альтернатива, подумайте о возможности управления выводом на более высоком уровне, например, сохранять выводимые в консоль сообщения и, при необходимости, повторно выводить модифицированное содержимое. Это может быть рациональным решением, если необходимо \\"удалять\\" строки в процессе интерактивной сессии, например, в текстовом пользовательском интерфейсе."},{"instruction":"Как на этом этапе сделать так чтобы он снова выводил строку введите первое число, если мы пытались ввести не те символы на первой, также со второй и третьей //Если ввод некорректен, выводим сообщение об ошибке и просим ввести число еще раз","output":"Чтобы снова запросить ввод числа, если пользователь ввёл некорректные символы, используйте цикл в функции \`getValidatedInput\`, который продолжает спрашивать пользователя до тех пор, пока не будет введено допустимое значение.

Каждый раз, когда функция вызывается, она выводит запрашиваемую подсказку и проверяет введённые данные. В случае некорректного ввода, она повторно выводит сообщение об ошибке и снова запрашивает ввод, начиная заново цикл. После суммирования введенных чисел программа спрашивает у пользователя, хочет ли он выполнить новый расчет. Если пользователь вводит \`Y\` или \`y\`, цикл повторяется, а если \`N\` или \`n\`, программа завершается."},{"instruction":"Напиши как одной строчкой заакончить программу","output":"Завершить программу на C++ одной строкой можно, вызвав стандартную функцию \`exit\`, которая объявлена в заголовочном файле \`<cstdlib>\`.

Пример однострочного вызова для завершения программы: \`\`\`cpp #include <cstdlib> // Нужно для использования функции exit // ... exit(0); // Завершает программу с кодом возврата 0 (нормальное завершение) \`\`\` Вот пример использования в контексте: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <cstdlib> // Для exit int main() { // ... код программы exit(0); // Однострочное завершение программы } \`\`\` Заметим, что использование \`exit\` приводит к немедленному завершению программы, минуя некоторые нормальные этапы очистки, такие как деструкторы глобальных и статических объектов или деструкторы всех автоматических объектов в текущем блоке. Поэтому, хотя \`exit\` и позволяет немедленно завершить программу, предпочтительнее испольщовать \`return\` в \`main\` для обычного завершения, так как это обеспечивает корректное выполнение всех этапов очистки."},{"instruction":"А как закончить программу нажатием Esc","output":"Чтобы завершить программу при нажатии клавиши Esc (Escape), вам необходимо считывать коды клавиш с консоли. В стандартных потоках ввода C++ нет прямого способа получить код клавиатуры, поэтому потребуется использовать платформозависимый код. Для Windows вы можете использовать функцию \`getch()\` или \`getche()\` из библиотеки \`conio.h\` для небуферизированного считывания клавиш. В Unix-подобных операционных системах, включая Linux и macOS, можно использовать библиотеку \`ncurses\`. Ниже приведен пример кода для Windows: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <conio.h> // для _getch() int main() { std::cout << \\"Нажмите Esc для выхода...\\" << std::endl; while (true) { if (_kbhit()) { // проверяем, была ли нажата клавиша int ch = _getch(); // получаем код клавиши if (ch == 27) { // 27 это код клавиши Esc break; } } // остальной код программы } return 0; } \`\`\` В Unix-подобных системах использование \`ncurses\` может выглядеть так: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <ncurses.h> int main() { initscr(); // инициализация ncurses noecho(); // выключаем эхо cbreak(); // немедленный ввод без буферизации nodelay(stdscr, TRUE); // делаем getch() неблокирующим keypad(stdscr, TRUE); // позволяем функции getch() читать специальные клавиши std::cout << \\"Нажмите Esc для выхода...\\" << std::endl; int ch; while ((ch = getch()) != 27) { // остальной код программы } endwin(); // завершаем работу с ncurses return 0; } \`\`\` В этом коде программа завершит выполнение при нажатии клавиши Esc. Обратите внимание, что этот код платформозависим и не будет работать в операционной системе, отличной от указанной. Для кроссплатформенной разработки вам придется использовать библиотеку или фреймворк, который предоставляет абстракцию для работы с клавишами на разных платформах, например, SDL или SFML."},{"instruction":"каак сделать чтобы программу можно было завершить на любом этапе ввода данных","output":"Чтобы завершить программу на любом этапе ввода данных, вы должны обрабатывать входные данные таким образом, чтобы распознавать специальный сигнал от пользователя, который будет означать запрос на завершение программы. Для консольных приложений на C++ это обычно реализуется путем проверки наличия определенного символа или строки в инструкции ввода. Пример реализации может выглядеть так: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <string> #include <sstream> double getValidatedInput(const std::string& prompt) { std::string input; double value; while (true) { std::cout << prompt; if (!std::getline(std::cin, input)) { // В случае EOF (например, Ctrl+D в Unix или Ctrl+Z в Windows), завершаем программу std::cout << \\"Обнаружен запрос завершения.

Также обрабатывается случай, когда поток ввода заканчивается (например, если пользователь нажмет Ctrl+D в Unix или Ctrl+Z в Windows), что также приводит к завершению программы. Обратите внимание, что я использовал \`std::exit\` для немедленного завершения программы с указанным статусом. Функция \`std::exit\` находится в заголовочном файле \`<cstdlib>\` и завершает программу, вызывая деструкторы статических объектов и освобождая ресурсы."},{"instruction":"как сделать чтобы программу можно было завершить на любом этапе ввода данных при нажатии esc","output":"Для обработки нажатий на клавиатуре в реальном времени, включая клавишу Escape (Esc), необходимо заходить в область платформозависимого функционала, так как стандартная библиотека C++ не предоставляет средств для низкоуровневой работы с клавиатурой. Например, на Windows можно использовать функцию \`GetAsyncKeyState()\` из WinAPI для обнаружения нажатия клавиши Esc. Ниже приведён пример кода, который демонстрирует, как это можно реализовать: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <string> #include <Windows.h> // Для использования функции GetAsyncKeyState() bool checkForKeyPress(int virtualKeyCode) { return GetAsyncKeyState(virtualKeyCode) & 0x8000; } int main() { std::string input; std::cout << \\"Введите данные (нажмите Esc для выхода): \\"; while (true) { if (checkForKeyPress(VK_ESCAPE)) { // Проверяем нажатие клавиши Escape std::cout << \\"nВыход из программы...n\\"; break; } if (std::getline(std::cin, input)) { // Обработка данных, введенных пользователем std::cout << \\"Вы ввели: \\" << input << \\"nВведите следующие данные (или нажмите Esc для выхода): \\"; } else { // Ввод завершен break; } } return 0; } \`\`\` Функция \`GetAsyncKeyState()\` проверяет состояние клавиши на момент последнего вызова. Передайте ей виртуальный код клавиши, которую вы хотите проверить (в данном случае \`VK_ESCAPE\` для клавиши Esc). Если старший бит возвращаемого значения установлен, это означает, что клавиша была нажата. Обратите внимание, что использование этой функции ожидает, что программа будет работать в фоновом режиме и проверять состояние клавиши во время выполнения цикла. Также \`GetAsyncKeyState()\` может вызывать проблемы, если ваша программа запущена в очень строгих условиях безопасности, так как эта функция может использоваться для регистрации нажатий клавиш. Для Unix-подобных систем, включая Linux и macOS, вы бы использовали библиотеку, такую как \`ncurses\`, для неблокирующего ввода и обнаружения нажатий клавиш, но это потребовало бы отличающуюся реализацию и сборку программы с линковкой под эту библиотеку. Важно помнить, что такие вызовы делают ваш программный код не переносимым и подходят только для конкретной операционной системы."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Natsuki, are you okay?” (Natsuki grips her belly tightly as another contraction hits her.)

By now we know that business activities such as stra- tegic planning are essential for gaining competitive advantages, but why is brand management important? What has changed in our media environment that makes a traditional consumer goods management tool and construct applicable to media products? In principle, the most essential driver for a branding strategy is the ele- ment of “competition” in a market. When consumers are faced with choices in products, they need a way to identify the one that will best sat- isfy their needs, so suppliers must create identities for their offerings to avoid confusion and reach the target consumers in the marketplace. The tremendous proliferation of media outlets and the continuous fragmen- tation of audiences during the last two decades have created an increas- ingly competitive media marketplace. The same element of “competition” that propelled the introduction of branding practices in consumer goods industries is now facilitating the application of brand management in many media industries as media firms race to establish clear and memo- rable brand images in a growingly complicated marketplace filled with infinite content offered by broadcasters, cablecasters, Internet, telcos, and DBS. In fact, the branding process is consistent with the “experience good” characteristic of media products: It is difficult for consumers to es- timate the quality of a new media product such as movies or television se- ries before they actually experience it. In order to avoid risks (e.g., money and time) related to purchasing and consuming these products, consum- ers may depend on brands and their associated images and expectations as one of the initial decision factors (Chang, 2004). WHAT IS BRANDING? Fundamentally, a brand is a name, term, sign, symbol, package design, or combination of these elements intended to identify and distinguish a product or service from its competitors. A “brand” is different from a “product” because, although it is designed to satisfy the same basic need as an unbranded product, it also adds certain rational, tangible and/or emotional, intangible attributes to a product so it is perceived to be dif- ferent from an unbranded product in its expected performance and ben- efits. In essence, these brand-related elements are supposed to communicate thoughts and feelings that enhance the value of a product beyond its product category and basic functional value. For instance, the brand New York Times represents a certain level of news reporting and editorial quality that distinguishes it from its competitors. Why are brands valuable? Keller (1998) succinctly listed a number of reasons why brands matter to both consumers and producers. He sug- gested that brands help consumers identify the source of a product, as- sign responsibility to product makers, reduce risk and search cost, signal quality, form relationships between consumers and product makers, and serve as a symbolic device. Brands also provide producers a means of identification to simplify handling or tracing, a way to legally protect unique features, a tool to signal “quality” levels, a means to endow prod- ucts with special associations, and a source of competitive advantages and thus the final financial returns. All of these benefits are applicable in the context of media products. For example, the brand name “PBS” is strongly associated with the images of “trust” and “quality” in the mind of television audiences (Chan-Olmsted & Y. Kim, 2002). The brand name “Discovery” has been used by its corporate owner in the introduction of various new cable channels and even retail learning products. There are various strategic aspects that a firm can pursue to engage competitors: marketing, production, financial, technological, and man- agerial. Whereas the topics in strategic management discussed in earlier chapters mainly dealt with managerial competition strategies, the de- velopment and maintenance of brands are traditionally a part of a mar- keting program. Because a brand is built over time, branding is also a continuous process of marketing activities that should be designed to reflect the changing life cycle of a product and its environment. Various marketing researchers have tried to explain the nature of brands and branding activities. Donahue (1995) suggested that a valuable brand has to be relevant and distinctive and brand-building activities may in- clude demonstrations, seminars, shows, effective service material, pub- lic relations, advertising, direct marketing, and promotions that extend positioning. Murphy (1987) indicated that branding consists of the de- velopment and maintenance of sets of product attributes and values that are coherent, appropriate, distinctive, protectable, and appealing to consumers. Cowley (1991) also stated that sources of added value in branding include a guarantee of authenticity, the promise of perfor- mance, the value of reassurance, and the transformation of experience (the subjective experience of using a brand, and differentiation or brand personality). The value of authenticity and promise of positive experi- ence seem to be especially important for media content providers in an increasingly crowded marketplace. In fact, Davis (1995) suggested that brand management should be viewed as a strategic management pro- cess to maximize the long-term value of a brand. The role of branding is often misunderstood by companies that have not had a traditional mar- keting focus. Many companies hire senior-level packaged goods mar- keters and expect quick fixes (Bissell, 1998). Branding is seen simply as a new “design and control” function to quickly clean up corporate iden- tity and wrap an existing product or service into a nice, neat package. Bissell reiterated the importance of management commitment in treat- ing branding as part of a firm’s fundamental strategic process and daily tactical operations. On the surface, the branding and brand management notions ap- pear to be less applicable to media industries due to many media prod- ucts’ intangible, nonpreservable nature, the possibility of group consumption, the selection of a content product based on the merits of individual units (e.g., movies), the lack of actual purchasing action (and risk) for advertising-supported content products, and the absence of easily identifiable product logos. In addition, prior to the 1990s, most media markets were relatively uncompetitive; media products were based on distinct technologies consumed in separate markets with distinctive consumer behaviors (McDowell, 2006). Nevertheless, the landscape of media industries has changed dramatically. We now have a converging media marketplace enabled by digital technologies and new network conduits such as the Internet; the potential for pro- viding additional new media services; and a fragmented, multitasking audience. These environmental developments present an unprece- dented need for differentiation using all possible means. With varying degrees, branding or brand management can enhance a media con- sumer’s association, perception, and expectation of a media product. For example, a radio station that has established a family-friendly brand may increase its chance of being selected by a certain segment of the audience. And a signature local news program can easily become a proprietary brand asset for a TV station. Although branding offers media firms opportunities for differentia- tion, the aforementioned media characteristics still present some chal- lenges in this process. In addition, there are general obstacles associated with the branding approach. For example, the essence of branding as de- veloping something of value often conflicts with the current accounting system, which treats a brand as an expense rather than asset. The neces- sary long-term orientation of brand building also conflicts with the gen- erally high personnel turnover in businesses. Finally, the integrated nature of brand building (i.e., the involvement of production, sales, mar- keting, etc.) often conflicts with the reality of a segmented organizational structure and single-dimension advertising focuses (Kapferer, 1992). BRAND MANAGEMENT CONCEPTS Brand management has become a major subfield within the marketing discipline over the years, infusing it with various theoretical constructs and analytical frameworks. Many of these conceptual building blocks are useful for analyzing media products and thus are reviewed next. Brand Identity Brand identity encompasses two dimensions: one that indicates the out- ward expression of a brand, including the tangible elements such as names, symbols, logos, slogans, and packaging that can be used to rec- ognize a brand; and the other that symbolizes the brand’s differentiated characteristics, including the unique set of associations that represent what the brand stands for and would do for customers. The process is the linking of differentiated features and attributes of a product or ser- vice to anticipated perceived benefits based on customers’ values and be- liefs. In a way, brand identity is like clothing to a product in that it can set one apart in a crowd as well as say something about the person who chooses the brand. It is important to note that brand identity is some- thing that is formulated and worked on by the firm, whereas another relevant concept, brand image, is based on consumer perception (i.e., formulated by the consumer). In other words, image is the result of how consumers interpret the brand identity put forth by a firm, amid noises and personal circumstances. Time can also change the identity of a brand as it gradually acquires other meanings from associations with things that are both intended and unintended by its firm. So how does a firm successfully develop a brand identity for a prod- uct? Kapferer (1992) suggested that brand identities should be formu- lated on the basis of three qualities: durability, coherence, and realism (as opposed to idealism or opportunism). Keller (1998) listed five criteria in choosing brand elements to form a brand identity: memorability, meaningfulness, transferability (both culturally and geographically), adaptability, and protectability (both legally and competitively). Cable networks offer some excellent examples of establishing and modifying a media brand over time. For example, Discovery Communications Inc.’s TLC channel began as an education network that offered foreign-lan- guage instruction, an SAT review course, and other adult personal-en- richment series with the name of “The Learning Channel” (Eastman, 1993). With the success of its reality-based series such as Trading Spaces and its continuous programming transformation to this particular genre, it is now renamed as “TLC” with a “Life Unscripted” slogan and logo. Finally, a firm may look to various sources to define a brand’s identity. Kapferer also suggested some sources of identities: (a) the ac- tual product or service through which the brand may display its uniqueness (e.g., NASA Television), (b) a brand name through which the brand may convey its characteristics (e.g., The Cartoon Network), (c) brand characters and symbols through which the brand may represent its traits and features in the etymological sense (e.g., PBS and its logo), (d) trademarks and logos through which a brand may reflect its person- ality and value (e.g., Playboy TV Networks), (e) geographical and his- torical roots through which a brand may paint its individuality and competence (e.g., BBC America cable channel), and (f) advertising through which a brand may develop or reinvent identities as conceived by its firm (e.g., TLC cable channel). Brand Knowledge: Awareness, Association, and Image Although a brand identity may be the strategic goal for a brand, the re- sultant brand image of what actually resides in the minds of consumers about the brand could be very different from that goal. According to Keller (1998), such a discrepancy is due to the differential brand knowl- edge structures of individual consumers as reflected by the levels of brand awareness and brand image (i.e., the strength, favorability, and uniqueness of brand associations) of that product. Creating “brand awareness” is often considered the first step of branding. Brand awareness can be defined as the degree to which a tar- get audience is able to identify a brand among others and even recall its promise. As a typical measure of marketing communications effective- ness, awareness may be assessed unaidedly or aidedly (i.e., when a brand name is recognized among others that are listed or identified). Conceptually, brand awareness is hierarchical. Keller (1993) suggested that brand awareness consists of brand recognition, which communi- cates consumers’ ability to verify prior exposure to the brand when given the brand as a cue, and brand recall, which relates consumers’ ability to retrieve the brand from memory when given cues such as ben- efits, usage/purchase situations, or product categories. Another related concept is “top-of-the-mind” awareness, which denotes the highest level of brand awareness for a brand because the brand is the first to come to mind when consumers recall a brand relating to a certain qual- ity. It is evident that brand awareness is fundamental to a brand’s suc- cess. For example, by increasing the brand awareness of HBO On Demand (a video-on-demand programming service offered by HBO), HBO raises the potential that an audience might include this service in his or her viewing consideration list. By increasing the brand awareness of Movielink.Com (a broadband movie download service), Movielink raises the probability that an audience might choose this service because it is perceived to be more established and familiar. This power of aware- ness is especially significant for new media products that consumers have not experienced or have no prior knowledge to relate to. Finally, by increasing the brand awareness of Bravo Cable Network, its owner, NBC, would have an easier time cultivating the associations that make up Bravo’s brand image. As indicated previously, brand image rests in the consumers’ minds and is developed through brand associations. Consequently, brand im- age may be defined as a unique set of associations within the target cus- tomers’ minds that characterizes what the brand stands for and implies the brand’s promise to them. For users of the brand, the image is also in- fluenced by their experience with the brand. For nonusers, the image is largely shaped by their impressions of the brand amid personal beliefs and attitudes. Keller (1998) identified three main types of brand associa- tions with increasing abstraction: attributes (product related or nonproduct related such as price and usage imagery), benefits (func- tional, symbolic, or experiential), and attitudes formed on the basis of beliefs about a product’s attributes and benefits. Note that a brand im- age is influenced not only by the types of associations but also by the strength, uniqueness, and favorability of the associations (Keller, 1998). For instance, Fox News has established relatively strong and unique brand associations based on certain attributes and benefits (e.g., conser- vative commentaries such as the O’Reilly Factor program). The value of its brand image, however, is largely dependent on an audience seg- ment’s favorability or desirability toward those associations.","output":"Title: The Importance of Brand Management in Media Industries Introduction: This chapter reviews major brand management concepts and theoretical frameworks and discusses their application to media products in a changing marketplace.

Yuri guides Natsuki through some breathing exercises, while Monika holds her hand and offers reassurance. Sayori tries to keep the atmosphere as calm as possible.)

Remember to breathe and stay as relaxed as possible. We’re here for you, every step of the way.” Natsuki: (taking deep breaths) “I can feel the baby coming… It’s… it’s happening!” (The girls rush to prepare the area as much as they can, making sure everything is clean and ready for the baby’s arrival. They surround Natsuki with love and support, doing their best to keep her calm and reassured.) Monika: (holding Natsuki’s hand) “You’re doing great, Natsuki. Just a little bit longer, and you’ll get to meet your beautiful baby.” Yuri: (softly) “Remember to push when your body tells you to, Natsuki. It’s important to work with your body’s natural rhythm.” Sayori: (teary-eyed) “We’re all here for you, Natsuki. You’re so strong, and we’re so proud of you.” (Natsuki’s contractions intensify, and with every surge, the girls offer words of encouragement and support. Suddenly, Natsuki screams in pain as more of the baby starts to come out.)","output":"Monika: (encouragingly) \\"Keep pushing, Natsuki! You're doing amazing!

By now we know that business activities such as stra- tegic planning are essential for gaining competitive advantages, but why is brand management important? What has changed in our media environment that makes a traditional consumer goods management tool and construct applicable to media products? In principle, the most essential driver for a branding strategy is the ele- ment of “competition” in a market. When consumers are faced with choices in products, they need a way to identify the one that will best sat- isfy their needs, so suppliers must create identities for their offerings to avoid confusion and reach the target consumers in the marketplace. The tremendous proliferation of media outlets and the continuous fragmen- tation of audiences during the last two decades have created an increas- ingly competitive media marketplace. The same element of “competition” that propelled the introduction of branding practices in consumer goods industries is now facilitating the application of brand management in many media industries as media firms race to establish clear and memo- rable brand images in a growingly complicated marketplace filled with infinite content offered by broadcasters, cablecasters, Internet, telcos, and DBS. In fact, the branding process is consistent with the “experience good” characteristic of media products: It is difficult for consumers to es- timate the quality of a new media product such as movies or television se- ries before they actually experience it. In order to avoid risks (e.g., money and time) related to purchasing and consuming these products, consum- ers may depend on brands and their associated images and expectations as one of the initial decision factors (Chang, 2004). WHAT IS BRANDING? Fundamentally, a brand is a name, term, sign, symbol, package design, or combination of these elements intended to identify and distinguish a product or service from its competitors. A “brand” is different from a “product” because, although it is designed to satisfy the same basic need as an unbranded product, it also adds certain rational, tangible and/or emotional, intangible attributes to a product so it is perceived to be dif- ferent from an unbranded product in its expected performance and ben- efits. In essence, these brand-related elements are supposed to communicate thoughts and feelings that enhance the value of a product beyond its product category and basic functional value. For instance, the brand New York Times represents a certain level of news reporting and editorial quality that distinguishes it from its competitors. Why are brands valuable? Keller (1998) succinctly listed a number of reasons why brands matter to both consumers and producers. He sug- gested that brands help consumers identify the source of a product, as- sign responsibility to product makers, reduce risk and search cost, signal quality, form relationships between consumers and product makers, and serve as a symbolic device. Brands also provide producers a means of identification to simplify handling or tracing, a way to legally protect unique features, a tool to signal “quality” levels, a means to endow prod- ucts with special associations, and a source of competitive advantages and thus the final financial returns. All of these benefits are applicable in the context of media products. For example, the brand name “PBS” is strongly associated with the images of “trust” and “quality” in the mind of television audiences (Chan-Olmsted & Y. Kim, 2002). The brand name “Discovery” has been used by its corporate owner in the introduction of various new cable channels and even retail learning products. There are various strategic aspects that a firm can pursue to engage competitors: marketing, production, financial, technological, and man- agerial. Whereas the topics in strategic management discussed in earlier chapters mainly dealt with managerial competition strategies, the de- velopment and maintenance of brands are traditionally a part of a mar- keting program. Because a brand is built over time, branding is also a continuous process of marketing activities that should be designed to reflect the changing life cycle of a product and its environment. Various marketing researchers have tried to explain the nature of brands and branding activities. Donahue (1995) suggested that a valuable brand has to be relevant and distinctive and brand-building activities may in- clude demonstrations, seminars, shows, effective service material, pub- lic relations, advertising, direct marketing, and promotions that extend positioning. Murphy (1987) indicated that branding consists of the de- velopment and maintenance of sets of product attributes and values that are coherent, appropriate, distinctive, protectable, and appealing to consumers. Cowley (1991) also stated that sources of added value in branding include a guarantee of authenticity, the promise of perfor- mance, the value of reassurance, and the transformation of experience (the subjective experience of using a brand, and differentiation or brand personality). The value of authenticity and promise of positive experi- ence seem to be especially important for media content providers in an increasingly crowded marketplace. In fact, Davis (1995) suggested that brand management should be viewed as a strategic management pro- cess to maximize the long-term value of a brand. The role of branding is often misunderstood by companies that have not had a traditional mar- keting focus. Many companies hire senior-level packaged goods mar- keters and expect quick fixes (Bissell, 1998). Branding is seen simply as a new “design and control” function to quickly clean up corporate iden- tity and wrap an existing product or service into a nice, neat package. Bissell reiterated the importance of management commitment in treat- ing branding as part of a firm’s fundamental strategic process and daily tactical operations. On the surface, the branding and brand management notions ap- pear to be less applicable to media industries due to many media prod- ucts’ intangible, nonpreservable nature, the possibility of group consumption, the selection of a content product based on the merits of individual units (e.g., movies), the lack of actual purchasing action (and risk) for advertising-supported content products, and the absence of easily identifiable product logos. In addition, prior to the 1990s, most media markets were relatively uncompetitive; media products were based on distinct technologies consumed in separate markets with distinctive consumer behaviors (McDowell, 2006). Nevertheless, the landscape of media industries has changed dramatically. We now have a converging media marketplace enabled by digital technologies and new network conduits such as the Internet; the potential for pro- viding additional new media services; and a fragmented, multitasking audience. These environmental developments present an unprece- dented need for differentiation using all possible means. With varying degrees, branding or brand management can enhance a media con- sumer’s association, perception, and expectation of a media product. For example, a radio station that has established a family-friendly brand may increase its chance of being selected by a certain segment of the audience. And a signature local news program can easily become a proprietary brand asset for a TV station. Although branding offers media firms opportunities for differentia- tion, the aforementioned media characteristics still present some chal- lenges in this process. In addition, there are general obstacles associated with the branding approach. For example, the essence of branding as de- veloping something of value often conflicts with the current accounting system, which treats a brand as an expense rather than asset. The neces- sary long-term orientation of brand building also conflicts with the gen- erally high personnel turnover in businesses. Finally, the integrated nature of brand building (i.e., the involvement of production, sales, mar- keting, etc.) often conflicts with the reality of a segmented organizational structure and single-dimension advertising focuses (Kapferer, 1992). BRAND MANAGEMENT CONCEPTS Brand management has become a major subfield within the marketing discipline over the years, infusing it with various theoretical constructs and analytical frameworks. Many of these conceptual building blocks are useful for analyzing media products and thus are reviewed next. Brand Identity Brand identity encompasses two dimensions: one that indicates the out- ward expression of a brand, including the tangible elements such as names, symbols, logos, slogans, and packaging that can be used to rec- ognize a brand; and the other that symbolizes the brand’s differentiated characteristics, including the unique set of associations that represent what the brand stands for and would do for customers. The process is the linking of differentiated features and attributes of a product or ser- vice to anticipated perceived benefits based on customers’ values and be- liefs. In a way, brand identity is like clothing to a product in that it can set one apart in a crowd as well as say something about the person who chooses the brand. It is important to note that brand identity is some- thing that is formulated and worked on by the firm, whereas another relevant concept, brand image, is based on consumer perception (i.e., formulated by the consumer). In other words, image is the result of how consumers interpret the brand identity put forth by a firm, amid noises and personal circumstances. Time can also change the identity of a brand as it gradually acquires other meanings from associations with things that are both intended and unintended by its firm. So how does a firm successfully develop a brand identity for a prod- uct? Kapferer (1992) suggested that brand identities should be formu- lated on the basis of three qualities: durability, coherence, and realism (as opposed to idealism or opportunism). Keller (1998) listed five criteria in choosing brand elements to form a brand identity: memorability, meaningfulness, transferability (both culturally and geographically), adaptability, and protectability (both legally and competitively). Cable networks offer some excellent examples of establishing and modifying a media brand over time. For example, Discovery Communications Inc.’s TLC channel began as an education network that offered foreign-lan- guage instruction, an SAT review course, and other adult personal-en- richment series with the name of “The Learning Channel” (Eastman, 1993). With the success of its reality-based series such as Trading Spaces and its continuous programming transformation to this particular genre, it is now renamed as “TLC” with a “Life Unscripted” slogan and logo. Finally, a firm may look to various sources to define a brand’s identity. Kapferer also suggested some sources of identities: (a) the ac- tual product or service through which the brand may display its uniqueness (e.g., NASA Television), (b) a brand name through which the brand may convey its characteristics (e.g., The Cartoon Network), (c) brand characters and symbols through which the brand may represent its traits and features in the etymological sense (e.g., PBS and its logo), (d) trademarks and logos through which a brand may reflect its person- ality and value (e.g., Playboy TV Networks), (e) geographical and his- torical roots through which a brand may paint its individuality and competence (e.g., BBC America cable channel), and (f) advertising through which a brand may develop or reinvent identities as conceived by its firm (e.g., TLC cable channel). Brand Knowledge: Awareness, Association, and Image Although a brand identity may be the strategic goal for a brand, the re- sultant brand image of what actually resides in the minds of consumers about the brand could be very different from that goal. According to Keller (1998), such a discrepancy is due to the differential brand knowl- edge structures of individual consumers as reflected by the levels of brand awareness and brand image (i.e., the strength, favorability, and uniqueness of brand associations) of that product. Creating “brand awareness” is often considered the first step of branding. Brand awareness can be defined as the degree to which a tar- get audience is able to identify a brand among others and even recall its promise. As a typical measure of marketing communications effective- ness, awareness may be assessed unaidedly or aidedly (i.e., when a brand name is recognized among others that are listed or identified). Conceptually, brand awareness is hierarchical. Keller (1993) suggested that brand awareness consists of brand recognition, which communi- cates consumers’ ability to verify prior exposure to the brand when given the brand as a cue, and brand recall, which relates consumers’ ability to retrieve the brand from memory when given cues such as ben- efits, usage/purchase situations, or product categories. Another related concept is “top-of-the-mind” awareness, which denotes the highest level of brand awareness for a brand because the brand is the first to come to mind when consumers recall a brand relating to a certain qual- ity. It is evident that brand awareness is fundamental to a brand’s suc- cess. For example, by increasing the brand awareness of HBO On Demand (a video-on-demand programming service offered by HBO), HBO raises the potential that an audience might include this service in his or her viewing consideration list. By increasing the brand awareness of Movielink.Com (a broadband movie download service), Movielink raises the probability that an audience might choose this service because it is perceived to be more established and familiar. This power of aware- ness is especially significant for new media products that consumers have not experienced or have no prior knowledge to relate to. Finally, by increasing the brand awareness of Bravo Cable Network, its owner, NBC, would have an easier time cultivating the associations that make up Bravo’s brand image. As indicated previously, brand image rests in the consumers’ minds and is developed through brand associations. Consequently, brand im- age may be defined as a unique set of associations within the target cus- tomers’ minds that characterizes what the brand stands for and implies the brand’s promise to them. For users of the brand, the image is also in- fluenced by their experience with the brand. For nonusers, the image is largely shaped by their impressions of the brand amid personal beliefs and attitudes. Keller (1998) identified three main types of brand associa- tions with increasing abstraction: attributes (product related or nonproduct related such as price and usage imagery), benefits (func- tional, symbolic, or experiential), and attitudes formed on the basis of beliefs about a product’s attributes and benefits. Note that a brand im- age is influenced not only by the types of associations but also by the strength, uniqueness, and favorability of the associations (Keller, 1998). For instance, Fox News has established relatively strong and unique brand associations based on certain attributes and benefits (e.g., conser- vative commentaries such as the O’Reilly Factor program). The value of its brand image, however, is largely dependent on an audience seg- ment’s favorability or desirability toward those associations.","output":"Summary: Moving from strategic management to brand management, this chapter discusses the importance of brand management in the changing media marketplace.

We need to help Natsuki through this. We can follow online guides or call for help while we assist her.” Monika: “Right. Let's check Natsuki's bag and see if there are any supplies that can help.” (As Monika rummages through Natsuki's bag, Yuri and Sayori hold Natsuki's hand, offering words of comfort.)

Let's make sure we do this correctly.” Yuri: (calming herself) “We should inform Natsuki about the next steps. Natsuki, we found towels and gloves. We will need to guide the baby out gently and wrap them in a towel, providing warmth and comfort.” Natsuki: (crying out) “Okay...okay, I trust you guys. Let's do this.” (The girls prepare the towels and gloves while following online guides and talking to emergency services for guidance.

We can see the baby's head.” Sayori: (nervously) “Remember to breathe, Natsuki. Inhale deeply and push with all your might.” Yuri: (gently) “You are incredibly strong, Natsuki. We're here for you every step of the way.” (With one final push, Natsuki delivers the baby. The girls quickly wrap the newborn in a towel, ensuring their warmth and safety.)

You're going to have the best mom ever!” (The sound of sirens grows closer as the ambulance team arrives at the literature clubroom.) Paramedic: “We received a call about a childbirth emergency. Is everything okay now?” Monika: (proudly) “Yes! Natsuki just delivered her baby with our help. They're both stable, but we should still get them checked out at the hospital.” (The paramedics examine Natsuki and praise the literature club girls for their quick thinking and support.) Paramedic: “You ladies did an incredible job. You should be proud of yourselves. Natsuki, congratulations on your new baby!” Natsuki: (with tears of joy) “Thank you all so much. I couldn't have done it without these amazing friends.” (The paramedics assist Natsuki and her baby to the ambulance while the girls gather their things and follow behind.)

By now we know that business activities such as stra- tegic planning are essential for gaining competitive advantages, but why is brand management important? What has changed in our media environment that makes a traditional consumer goods management tool and construct applicable to media products? In principle, the most essential driver for a branding strategy is the ele- ment of “competition” in a market. When consumers are faced with choices in products, they need a way to identify the one that will best sat- isfy their needs, so suppliers must create identities for their offerings to avoid confusion and reach the target consumers in the marketplace. The tremendous proliferation of media outlets and the continuous fragmen- tation of audiences during the last two decades have created an increas- ingly competitive media marketplace. The same element of “competition” that propelled the introduction of branding practices in consumer goods industries is now facilitating the application of brand management in many media industries as media firms race to establish clear and memo- rable brand images in a growingly complicated marketplace filled with infinite content offered by broadcasters, cablecasters, Internet, telcos, and DBS. In fact, the branding process is consistent with the “experience good” characteristic of media products: It is difficult for consumers to es- timate the quality of a new media product such as movies or television se- ries before they actually experience it. In order to avoid risks (e.g., money and time) related to purchasing and consuming these products, consum- ers may depend on brands and their associated images and expectations as one of the initial decision factors (Chang, 2004). WHAT IS BRANDING? Fundamentally, a brand is a name, term, sign, symbol, package design, or combination of these elements intended to identify and distinguish a product or service from its competitors. A “brand” is different from a “product” because, although it is designed to satisfy the same basic need as an unbranded product, it also adds certain rational, tangible and/or emotional, intangible attributes to a product so it is perceived to be dif- ferent from an unbranded product in its expected performance and ben- efits. In essence, these brand-related elements are supposed to communicate thoughts and feelings that enhance the value of a product beyond its product category and basic functional value. For instance, the brand New York Times represents a certain level of news reporting and editorial quality that distinguishes it from its competitors. Why are brands valuable? Keller (1998) succinctly listed a number of reasons why brands matter to both consumers and producers. He sug- gested that brands help consumers identify the source of a product, as- sign responsibility to product makers, reduce risk and search cost, signal quality, form relationships between consumers and product makers, and serve as a symbolic device. Brands also provide producers a means of identification to simplify handling or tracing, a way to legally protect unique features, a tool to signal “quality” levels, a means to endow prod- ucts with special associations, and a source of competitive advantages and thus the final financial returns. All of these benefits are applicable in the context of media products. For example, the brand name “PBS” is strongly associated with the images of “trust” and “quality” in the mind of television audiences (Chan-Olmsted & Y. Kim, 2002). The brand name “Discovery” has been used by its corporate owner in the introduction of various new cable channels and even retail learning products. There are various strategic aspects that a firm can pursue to engage competitors: marketing, production, financial, technological, and man- agerial. Whereas the topics in strategic management discussed in earlier chapters mainly dealt with managerial competition strategies, the de- velopment and maintenance of brands are traditionally a part of a mar- keting program. Because a brand is built over time, branding is also a continuous process of marketing activities that should be designed to reflect the changing life cycle of a product and its environment. Various marketing researchers have tried to explain the nature of brands and branding activities. Donahue (1995) suggested that a valuable brand has to be relevant and distinctive and brand-building activities may in- clude demonstrations, seminars, shows, effective service material, pub- lic relations, advertising, direct marketing, and promotions that extend positioning. Murphy (1987) indicated that branding consists of the de- velopment and maintenance of sets of product attributes and values that are coherent, appropriate, distinctive, protectable, and appealing to consumers. Cowley (1991) also stated that sources of added value in branding include a guarantee of authenticity, the promise of perfor- mance, the value of reassurance, and the transformation of experience (the subjective experience of using a brand, and differentiation or brand personality). The value of authenticity and promise of positive experi- ence seem to be especially important for media content providers in an increasingly crowded marketplace. In fact, Davis (1995) suggested that brand management should be viewed as a strategic management pro- cess to maximize the long-term value of a brand. The role of branding is often misunderstood by companies that have not had a traditional mar- keting focus. Many companies hire senior-level packaged goods mar- keters and expect quick fixes (Bissell, 1998). Branding is seen simply as a new “design and control” function to quickly clean up corporate iden- tity and wrap an existing product or service into a nice, neat package. Bissell reiterated the importance of management commitment in treat- ing branding as part of a firm’s fundamental strategic process and daily tactical operations. On the surface, the branding and brand management notions ap- pear to be less applicable to media industries due to many media prod- ucts’ intangible, nonpreservable nature, the possibility of group consumption, the selection of a content product based on the merits of individual units (e.g., movies), the lack of actual purchasing action (and risk) for advertising-supported content products, and the absence of easily identifiable product logos. In addition, prior to the 1990s, most media markets were relatively uncompetitive; media products were based on distinct technologies consumed in separate markets with distinctive consumer behaviors (McDowell, 2006). Nevertheless, the landscape of media industries has changed dramatically. We now have a converging media marketplace enabled by digital technologies and new network conduits such as the Internet; the potential for pro- viding additional new media services; and a fragmented, multitasking audience. These environmental developments present an unprece- dented need for differentiation using all possible means. With varying degrees, branding or brand management can enhance a media con- sumer’s association, perception, and expectation of a media product. For example, a radio station that has established a family-friendly brand may increase its chance of being selected by a certain segment of the audience. And a signature local news program can easily become a proprietary brand asset for a TV station. Although branding offers media firms opportunities for differentia- tion, the aforementioned media characteristics still present some chal- lenges in this process. In addition, there are general obstacles associated with the branding approach. For example, the essence of branding as de- veloping something of value often conflicts with the current accounting system, which treats a brand as an expense rather than asset. The neces- sary long-term orientation of brand building also conflicts with the gen- erally high personnel turnover in businesses. Finally, the integrated nature of brand building (i.e., the involvement of production, sales, mar- keting, etc.) often conflicts with the reality of a segmented organizational structure and single-dimension advertising focuses (Kapferer, 1992). BRAND MANAGEMENT CONCEPTS Brand management has become a major subfield within the marketing discipline over the years, infusing it with various theoretical constructs and analytical frameworks. Many of these conceptual building blocks are useful for analyzing media products and thus are reviewed next. Brand Identity Brand identity encompasses two dimensions: one that indicates the out- ward expression of a brand, including the tangible elements such as names, symbols, logos, slogans, and packaging that can be used to rec- ognize a brand; and the other that symbolizes the brand’s differentiated characteristics, including the unique set of associations that represent what the brand stands for and would do for customers. The process is the linking of differentiated features and attributes of a product or ser- vice to anticipated perceived benefits based on customers’ values and be- liefs. In a way, brand identity is like clothing to a product in that it can set one apart in a crowd as well as say something about the person who chooses the brand. It is important to note that brand identity is some- thing that is formulated and worked on by the firm, whereas another relevant concept, brand image, is based on consumer perception (i.e., formulated by the consumer). In other words, image is the result of how consumers interpret the brand identity put forth by a firm, amid noises and personal circumstances. Time can also change the identity of a brand as it gradually acquires other meanings from associations with things that are both intended and unintended by its firm. So how does a firm successfully develop a brand identity for a prod- uct? Kapferer (1992) suggested that brand identities should be formu- lated on the basis of three qualities: durability, coherence, and realism (as opposed to idealism or opportunism). Keller (1998) listed five criteria in choosing brand elements to form a brand identity: memorability, meaningfulness, transferability (both culturally and geographically), adaptability, and protectability (both legally and competitively). Cable networks offer some excellent examples of establishing and modifying a media brand over time. For example, Discovery Communications Inc.’s TLC channel began as an education network that offered foreign-lan- guage instruction, an SAT review course, and other adult personal-en- richment series with the name of “The Learning Channel” (Eastman, 1993). With the success of its reality-based series such as Trading Spaces and its continuous programming transformation to this particular genre, it is now renamed as “TLC” with a “Life Unscripted” slogan and logo. Finally, a firm may look to various sources to define a brand’s identity. Kapferer also suggested some sources of identities: (a) the ac- tual product or service through which the brand may display its uniqueness (e.g., NASA Television), (b) a brand name through which the brand may convey its characteristics (e.g., The Cartoon Network), (c) brand characters and symbols through which the brand may represent its traits and features in the etymological sense (e.g., PBS and its logo), (d) trademarks and logos through which a brand may reflect its person- ality and value (e.g., Playboy TV Networks), (e) geographical and his- torical roots through which a brand may paint its individuality and competence (e.g., BBC America cable channel), and (f) advertising through which a brand may develop or reinvent identities as conceived by its firm (e.g., TLC cable channel). Brand Knowledge: Awareness, Association, and Image Although a brand identity may be the strategic goal for a brand, the re- sultant brand image of what actually resides in the minds of consumers about the brand could be very different from that goal. According to Keller (1998), such a discrepancy is due to the differential brand knowl- edge structures of individual consumers as reflected by the levels of brand awareness and brand image (i.e., the strength, favorability, and uniqueness of brand associations) of that product. Creating “brand awareness” is often considered the first step of branding. Brand awareness can be defined as the degree to which a tar- get audience is able to identify a brand among others and even recall its promise. As a typical measure of marketing communications effective- ness, awareness may be assessed unaidedly or aidedly (i.e., when a brand name is recognized among others that are listed or identified). Conceptually, brand awareness is hierarchical. Keller (1993) suggested that brand awareness consists of brand recognition, which communi- cates consumers’ ability to verify prior exposure to the brand when given the brand as a cue, and brand recall, which relates consumers’ ability to retrieve the brand from memory when given cues such as ben- efits, usage/purchase situations, or product categories. Another related concept is “top-of-the-mind” awareness, which denotes the highest level of brand awareness for a brand because the brand is the first to come to mind when consumers recall a brand relating to a certain qual- ity. It is evident that brand awareness is fundamental to a brand’s suc- cess. For example, by increasing the brand awareness of HBO On Demand (a video-on-demand programming service offered by HBO), HBO raises the potential that an audience might include this service in his or her viewing consideration list. By increasing the brand awareness of Movielink.Com (a broadband movie download service), Movielink raises the probability that an audience might choose this service because it is perceived to be more established and familiar. This power of aware- ness is especially significant for new media products that consumers have not experienced or have no prior knowledge to relate to. Finally, by increasing the brand awareness of Bravo Cable Network, its owner, NBC, would have an easier time cultivating the associations that make up Bravo’s brand image. As indicated previously, brand image rests in the consumers’ minds and is developed through brand associations. Consequently, brand im- age may be defined as a unique set of associations within the target cus- tomers’ minds that characterizes what the brand stands for and implies the brand’s promise to them. For users of the brand, the image is also in- fluenced by their experience with the brand. For nonusers, the image is largely shaped by their impressions of the brand amid personal beliefs and attitudes. Keller (1998) identified three main types of brand associa- tions with increasing abstraction: attributes (product related or nonproduct related such as price and usage imagery), benefits (func- tional, symbolic, or experiential), and attitudes formed on the basis of beliefs about a product’s attributes and benefits. Note that a brand im- age is influenced not only by the types of associations but also by the strength, uniqueness, and favorability of the associations (Keller, 1998). For instance, Fox News has established relatively strong and unique brand associations based on certain attributes and benefits (e.g., conser- vative commentaries such as the O’Reilly Factor program). The value of its brand image, however, is largely dependent on an audience seg- ment’s favorability or desirability toward those associations.","output":"Summary: Title: The Importance of Brand Management in Media Industries Moving from strategic management to “brands,” this chapter reviews major brand management concepts and theoretical frameworks. It discusses the importance of brand management in a changing media marketplace and provides examples of brand management practices in media industries. The chapter also explores the concepts of brand identity and brand knowledge. Brand management is essential in a competitive market, as it helps consumers identify products and suppliers differentiate their offerings. In the media industry, the competition has increased due to the proliferation of media outlets and the fragmentation of audiences. Therefore, brand management is crucial for media firms to establish clear and memorable brand images. A brand is different from a product as it adds rational and emotional attributes to fulfill customers' needs. Brands help consumers identify the source of a product, reduce risk and search costs, signal quality, and form relationships. For media products, brands can convey trust, quality, and authenticity. Branding is a continuous process that should reflect the changing life cycle of a product and its environment. It involves developing and maintaining sets of product attributes and values that are coherent, appropriate, distinctive, and appealing to consumers. Branding also requires management commitment and integration with marketing activities. In media industries, branding faces challenges due to the intangible nature of products, group consumption, and lack of identifiable logos. However, with the convergence of media platforms and the fragmentation of audiences, differentiation through branding has become crucial. Brand identity involves both outward expression and unique associations that represent what the brand stands for. Brand awareness and brand image are important components of brand knowledge. Awareness refers to recognizing and recalling a brand, while image consists of the associations formed in consumers' minds based on attributes and benefits. Creating brand awareness is vital for success, as it helps consumers identify and recall a brand. Brand image, on the other hand, is influenced by brand associations, including attributes, benefits, and attitudes. In summary, brand management plays a significant role in media industries to differentiate products, enhance associations and expectations, and establish strong brand identities."},{"instruction":"چرا اذیت میکنی آخه ؟؟؟؟؟؟؟؟؟؟","output":"پوزش می‌طلبم اگر شما را اذیت کردم. من یک محرک هوشمند هستم که تلاش می‌کنم تمامی نیازهای شما را برآورده کنم. لطفاً اگر هر مشکل یا نارضایتی‌ای دارید، بفرمایید تا سعی کنم آن را رفع کنم."},{"instruction":"گفتم متن را خلاصه کن و تیترها رو هم بنویس . ولی ننوشتی ... باید بخش به بخش خلاصه بشه","output":"ببخشید برای سوءتفاهم در فهم درخواست شما. الگوریتم تلاش میکند تا بهترین پاسخ را ارائه دهد اما ممکن است نتواند دقیقا همان موردی که مدنظر شماست ارائه دهد. اینجانب تمام توانم را خواهم گذاشت تا بتوانم به درخواست شما پاسخ مناسبی دهم. ببخشید اگر ناخواسته شما را ناراحت کردم."},{"instruction":"write c++ program that outputs the input of a user","output":"Here's a simple C++ program that prompts the user for input and outputs it: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <string> int main() { std::string userInput; std::cout << \\"Enter something: \\"; std::getline(std::cin, userInput); std::cout << \\"You entered: \\" << userInput << std::endl; return 0; } \`\`\` In this program, we declare a string variable \`userInput\` to store the user's input.

By now we know that business activities such as stra- tegic planning are essential for gaining competitive advantages, but why is brand management important? What has changed in our media environment that makes a traditional consumer goods management tool and construct applicable to media products? In principle, the most essential driver for a branding strategy is the ele- ment of “competition” in a market. When consumers are faced with choices in products, they need a way to identify the one that will best sat- isfy their needs, so suppliers must create identities for their offerings to avoid confusion and reach the target consumers in the marketplace. The tremendous proliferation of media outlets and the continuous fragmen- tation of audiences during the last two decades have created an increas- ingly competitive media marketplace. The same element of “competition” that propelled the introduction of branding practices in consumer goods industries is now facilitating the application of brand management in many media industries as media firms race to establish clear and memo- rable brand images in a growingly complicated marketplace filled with infinite content offered by broadcasters, cablecasters, Internet, telcos, and DBS. In fact, the branding process is consistent with the “experience good” characteristic of media products: It is difficult for consumers to es- timate the quality of a new media product such as movies or television se- ries before they actually experience it. In order to avoid risks (e.g., money and time) related to purchasing and consuming these products, consum- ers may depend on brands and their associated images and expectations as one of the initial decision factors (Chang, 2004). WHAT IS BRANDING? Fundamentally, a brand is a name, term, sign, symbol, package design, or combination of these elements intended to identify and distinguish a product or service from its competitors. A “brand” is different from a “product” because, although it is designed to satisfy the same basic need as an unbranded product, it also adds certain rational, tangible and/or emotional, intangible attributes to a product so it is perceived to be dif- ferent from an unbranded product in its expected performance and ben- efits. In essence, these brand-related elements are supposed to communicate thoughts and feelings that enhance the value of a product beyond its product category and basic functional value. For instance, the brand New York Times represents a certain level of news reporting and editorial quality that distinguishes it from its competitors. Why are brands valuable? Keller (1998) succinctly listed a number of reasons why brands matter to both consumers and producers. He sug- gested that brands help consumers identify the source of a product, as- sign responsibility to product makers, reduce risk and search cost, signal quality, form relationships between consumers and product makers, and serve as a symbolic device. Brands also provide producers a means of identification to simplify handling or tracing, a way to legally protect unique features, a tool to signal “quality” levels, a means to endow prod- ucts with special associations, and a source of competitive advantages and thus the final financial returns. All of these benefits are applicable in the context of media products. For example, the brand name “PBS” is strongly associated with the images of “trust” and “quality” in the mind of television audiences (Chan-Olmsted & Y. Kim, 2002). The brand name “Discovery” has been used by its corporate owner in the introduction of various new cable channels and even retail learning products. There are various strategic aspects that a firm can pursue to engage competitors: marketing, production, financial, technological, and man- agerial. Whereas the topics in strategic management discussed in earlier chapters mainly dealt with managerial competition strategies, the de- velopment and maintenance of brands are traditionally a part of a mar- keting program. Because a brand is built over time, branding is also a continuous process of marketing activities that should be designed to reflect the changing life cycle of a product and its environment. Various marketing researchers have tried to explain the nature of brands and branding activities. Donahue (1995) suggested that a valuable brand has to be relevant and distinctive and brand-building activities may in- clude demonstrations, seminars, shows, effective service material, pub- lic relations, advertising, direct marketing, and promotions that extend positioning. Murphy (1987) indicated that branding consists of the de- velopment and maintenance of sets of product attributes and values that are coherent, appropriate, distinctive, protectable, and appealing to consumers. Cowley (1991) also stated that sources of added value in branding include a guarantee of authenticity, the promise of perfor- mance, the value of reassurance, and the transformation of experience (the subjective experience of using a brand, and differentiation or brand personality). The value of authenticity and promise of positive experi- ence seem to be especially important for media content providers in an increasingly crowded marketplace. In fact, Davis (1995) suggested that brand management should be viewed as a strategic management pro- cess to maximize the long-term value of a brand. The role of branding is often misunderstood by companies that have not had a traditional mar- keting focus. Many companies hire senior-level packaged goods mar- keters and expect quick fixes (Bissell, 1998). Branding is seen simply as a new “design and control” function to quickly clean up corporate iden- tity and wrap an existing product or service into a nice, neat package. Bissell reiterated the importance of management commitment in treat- ing branding as part of a firm’s fundamental strategic process and daily tactical operations. On the surface, the branding and brand management notions ap- pear to be less applicable to media industries due to many media prod- ucts’ intangible, nonpreservable nature, the possibility of group consumption, the selection of a content product based on the merits of individual units (e.g., movies), the lack of actual purchasing action (and risk) for advertising-supported content products, and the absence of easily identifiable product logos. In addition, prior to the 1990s, most media markets were relatively uncompetitive; media products were based on distinct technologies consumed in separate markets with distinctive consumer behaviors (McDowell, 2006). Nevertheless, the landscape of media industries has changed dramatically. We now have a converging media marketplace enabled by digital technologies and new network conduits such as the Internet; the potential for pro- viding additional new media services; and a fragmented, multitasking audience. These environmental developments present an unprece- dented need for differentiation using all possible means. With varying degrees, branding or brand management can enhance a media con- sumer’s association, perception, and expectation of a media product. For example, a radio station that has established a family-friendly brand may increase its chance of being selected by a certain segment of the audience. And a signature local news program can easily become a proprietary brand asset for a TV station. Although branding offers media firms opportunities for differentia- tion, the aforementioned media characteristics still present some chal- lenges in this process. In addition, there are general obstacles associated with the branding approach. For example, the essence of branding as de- veloping something of value often conflicts with the current accounting system, which treats a brand as an expense rather than asset. The neces- sary long-term orientation of brand building also conflicts with the gen- erally high personnel turnover in businesses. Finally, the integrated nature of brand building (i.e., the involvement of production, sales, mar- keting, etc.) often conflicts with the reality of a segmented organizational structure and single-dimension advertising focuses (Kapferer, 1992). BRAND MANAGEMENT CONCEPTS Brand management has become a major subfield within the marketing discipline over the years, infusing it with various theoretical constructs and analytical frameworks. Many of these conceptual building blocks are useful for analyzing media products and thus are reviewed next. Brand Identity Brand identity encompasses two dimensions: one that indicates the out- ward expression of a brand, including the tangible elements such as names, symbols, logos, slogans, and packaging that can be used to rec- ognize a brand; and the other that symbolizes the brand’s differentiated characteristics, including the unique set of associations that represent what the brand stands for and would do for customers. The process is the linking of differentiated features and attributes of a product or ser- vice to anticipated perceived benefits based on customers’ values and be- liefs. In a way, brand identity is like clothing to a product in that it can set one apart in a crowd as well as say something about the person who chooses the brand. It is important to note that brand identity is some- thing that is formulated and worked on by the firm, whereas another relevant concept, brand image, is based on consumer perception (i.e., formulated by the consumer). In other words, image is the result of how consumers interpret the brand identity put forth by a firm, amid noises and personal circumstances. Time can also change the identity of a brand as it gradually acquires other meanings from associations with things that are both intended and unintended by its firm. So how does a firm successfully develop a brand identity for a prod- uct? Kapferer (1992) suggested that brand identities should be formu- lated on the basis of three qualities: durability, coherence, and realism (as opposed to idealism or opportunism). Keller (1998) listed five criteria in choosing brand elements to form a brand identity: memorability, meaningfulness, transferability (both culturally and geographically), adaptability, and protectability (both legally and competitively). Cable networks offer some excellent examples of establishing and modifying a media brand over time. For example, Discovery Communications Inc.’s TLC channel began as an education network that offered foreign-lan- guage instruction, an SAT review course, and other adult personal-en- richment series with the name of “The Learning Channel” (Eastman, 1993). With the success of its reality-based series such as Trading Spaces and its continuous programming transformation to this particular genre, it is now renamed as “TLC” with a “Life Unscripted” slogan and logo. Finally, a firm may look to various sources to define a brand’s identity. Kapferer also suggested some sources of identities: (a) the ac- tual product or service through which the brand may display its uniqueness (e.g., NASA Television), (b) a brand name through which the brand may convey its characteristics (e.g., The Cartoon Network), (c) brand characters and symbols through which the brand may represent its traits and features in the etymological sense (e.g., PBS and its logo), (d) trademarks and logos through which a brand may reflect its person- ality and value (e.g., Playboy TV Networks), (e) geographical and his- torical roots through which a brand may paint its individuality and competence (e.g., BBC America cable channel), and (f) advertising through which a brand may develop or reinvent identities as conceived by its firm (e.g., TLC cable channel). Brand Knowledge: Awareness, Association, and Image Although a brand identity may be the strategic goal for a brand, the re- sultant brand image of what actually resides in the minds of consumers about the brand could be very different from that goal. According to Keller (1998), such a discrepancy is due to the differential brand knowl- edge structures of individual consumers as reflected by the levels of brand awareness and brand image (i.e., the strength, favorability, and uniqueness of brand associations) of that product. Creating “brand awareness” is often considered the first step of branding. Brand awareness can be defined as the degree to which a tar- get audience is able to identify a brand among others and even recall its promise. As a typical measure of marketing communications effective- ness, awareness may be assessed unaidedly or aidedly (i.e., when a brand name is recognized among others that are listed or identified). Conceptually, brand awareness is hierarchical. Keller (1993) suggested that brand awareness consists of brand recognition, which communi- cates consumers’ ability to verify prior exposure to the brand when given the brand as a cue, and brand recall, which relates consumers’ ability to retrieve the brand from memory when given cues such as ben- efits, usage/purchase situations, or product categories. Another related concept is “top-of-the-mind” awareness, which denotes the highest level of brand awareness for a brand because the brand is the first to come to mind when consumers recall a brand relating to a certain qual- ity. It is evident that brand awareness is fundamental to a brand’s suc- cess. For example, by increasing the brand awareness of HBO On Demand (a video-on-demand programming service offered by HBO), HBO raises the potential that an audience might include this service in his or her viewing consideration list. By increasing the brand awareness of Movielink.Com (a broadband movie download service), Movielink raises the probability that an audience might choose this service because it is perceived to be more established and familiar. This power of aware- ness is especially significant for new media products that consumers have not experienced or have no prior knowledge to relate to. Finally, by increasing the brand awareness of Bravo Cable Network, its owner, NBC, would have an easier time cultivating the associations that make up Bravo’s brand image. As indicated previously, brand image rests in the consumers’ minds and is developed through brand associations. Consequently, brand im- age may be defined as a unique set of associations within the target cus- tomers’ minds that characterizes what the brand stands for and implies the brand’s promise to them. For users of the brand, the image is also in- fluenced by their experience with the brand. For nonusers, the image is largely shaped by their impressions of the brand amid personal beliefs and attitudes. Keller (1998) identified three main types of brand associa- tions with increasing abstraction: attributes (product related or nonproduct related such as price and usage imagery), benefits (func- tional, symbolic, or experiential), and attitudes formed on the basis of beliefs about a product’s attributes and benefits. Note that a brand im- age is influenced not only by the types of associations but also by the strength, uniqueness, and favorability of the associations (Keller, 1998). For instance, Fox News has established relatively strong and unique brand associations based on certain attributes and benefits (e.g., conser- vative commentaries such as the O’Reilly Factor program). The value of its brand image, however, is largely dependent on an audience seg- ment’s favorability or desirability toward those associations.","output":"Title: The Importance of Brand Management in Media Industries Moving from strategic management to “brands,” this chapter reviews major brand management concepts and theoretical frameworks such as brand knowledge and brand equity, discusses how these concepts and frameworks might apply to media products in the context of a changing marketplace, and provides examples of brand management practices in media industries. Why is brand management important in the media industry? This chapter explores the changing media environment and the increasing competition in the marketplace. The proliferation of media outlets and the fragmentation of audiences have led to a need for brands to stand out and attract consumers. Brands serve as a tool for consumers to identify products that will satisfy their needs and minimize the risks associated with purchasing and consuming media products. What is branding? A brand is a name, term, or symbol that distinguishes a product or service from its competitors. Brands go beyond meeting basic needs and add tangible and intangible attributes that enhance the product's perceived value. Brands help consumers identify the source of a product, signal quality, reduce risk and search cost, and form relationships with product makers. Brand management has become a major subfield in marketing, with various theoretical constructs and analytical frameworks. Brand identity is the outward expression of a brand, including tangible elements like names, logos, and packaging, as well as the unique set of associations that represent what the brand stands for. Brand awareness is the degree to which consumers can identify a brand among others and recall its promise. Brand image is the unique set of associations within consumers' minds that characterize what the brand stands for and implies its promise. Creating brand awareness is a crucial step in branding, as it increases the brand's potential for success. Brand image is shaped by the types, strength, uniqueness, and favorability of brand associations. Brands in the media industry face unique challenges due to the intangible nature of media products and the absence of easily identifiable logos. However, branding offers opportunities for differentiation and enhancing consumer associations, perceptions, and expectations of media products. Overall, brand management plays a vital role in the media industry by helping media firms establish clear and memorable brand images in a competitive marketplace filled with infinite content options."},{"instruction":"چرا تیتر هر بخش رو نمینویسی؟","output":"ببخشید که تیتر هر بخش را ننوشتم. اینجا هستند تیترهای هر بخش: 1.

Cloud hosting offers the flexibility and scalability needed for businesses with bespoke applications. With cloud hosting, the business can easily scale up or down their resources and adjust their infrastructure according to the requirements of their bespoke applications. This flexibility allows for efficient resource allocation and cost savings, as the business only pays for the resources they actually use. Additionally, cloud hosting providers typically offer a range of management tools and APIs that allow businesses to customize and optimize their hosting environment for their specific applications. This level of customization and flexibility makes cloud hosting an ideal choice for businesses with bespoke applications."},{"instruction":"Read the article and provide your ideas on the following scenarios for suitable hosting provision - provide justification 2，What type of hosting would you recommend for a small business website - 10 pages and a couple of products.","output":"For a small business website with 10 pages and a couple of products, a suitable hosting provision would be shared hosting. Shared hosting is a cost-effective option that is well-suited for small businesses with relatively low traffic and resource requirements. It involves hosting multiple websites on a single server, with each website sharing the server's resources such as CPU, memory, and storage. Shared hosting is recommended for this scenario because it offers affordability, simplicity, and ease of use. Since the website is small and not expected to receive high levels of traffic, shared hosting can provide sufficient resources to handle its needs. Additionally, shared hosting often includes user-friendly control panels and one-click installation options, making it easy for small business owners to manage their website and add products or make updates. While shared hosting may have some limitations in terms of resource allocation and performance compared to other hosting types, it is an ideal choice for small businesses with limited budgets and simple website requirements like 10 pages and a couple of products. As the business grows and receives higher traffic volumes, it can consider upgrading to a more robust hosting solution."},{"instruction":"Read the article and provide your ideas on the following scenarios for suitable hosting provision - provide justification 3,For a Large International Business running multiple websites","output":"For a large international business running multiple websites, a suitable hosting provision would be a dedicated server or virtual private server (VPS) hosting. Dedicated server hosting involves renting an entire physical server dedicated solely to the business's websites. This provides complete control over the server's resources and allows for high levels of customization, security, and performance. It is the best option for large businesses with high traffic volumes, resource-intensive applications, and complex infrastructure requirements. A VPS hosting solution, on the other hand, offers a similar level of control and customization but involves virtualization technology that partitions a physical server into multiple virtual servers. Each virtual server acts as an independent dedicated server, giving businesses the flexibility to run multiple websites with different configurations on a single physical server. This can be a more cost-effective option compared to dedicated server hosting, while still offering excellent performance, scalability, and security. Both dedicated server and VPS hosting options are recommended for large international businesses running multiple websites. They allow for the management of heavy traffic and complex infrastructure requirements, ensuring optimal performance and reliability across all websites. Additionally, these hosting solutions typically offer advanced server management tools, 24/7 customer support, and high-level security measures to meet the specific needs of large businesses operating on a global scale."},{"instruction":"Write a summary comparing the initial site with its competitors.Tesco & Amazon Highlight areas where the initial site excels or needs improvement. Suggest possible improvements or strategies.","output":"The initial site, in comparison to its competitors Tesco and Amazon, showcases both areas of excellence and areas where improvement is needed. In terms of areas where the initial site excels, it may offer unique features or a more personalized experience for users. For example, it could provide personalized product recommendations based on user preferences or browsing history. This level of personalization can enhance the user experience and increase customer engagement. However, there are areas where the initial site could improve in comparison to Tesco and Amazon. One aspect to consider is the user interface and website design. If the initial site's design is not user-friendly, intuitive, or visually appealing, it may deter potential customers from using the site. Tesco and Amazon are known for their user-friendly interfaces, seamless navigation, and visually appealing designs, so the initial site should aim to match or exceed these standards. Another area for improvement could be the delivery and logistics system. Tesco and Amazon have established efficient and reliable delivery networks, offering options like next-day delivery or click-and-collect services. The initial site should consider optimizing its delivery processes to provide fast and reliable shipping options to customers. To improve the competitor gap, the initial site could implement strategies like investing in website optimization and performance. This includes optimizing page load speed, ensuring responsive design for mobile users, and implementing secure checkout processes. Such improvements can enhance the overall user experience and encourage customers to choose the initial site over its competitors. Additionally, the initial site could consider expanding its product range or diversifying its offerings to cater to a wider customer base. This can attract new customers and increase competitiveness in the market. Overall, by focusing on enhancing user experience, improving website design and functionality, optimizing delivery logistics, and expanding product offerings, the initial site can close the gap with its competitors Tesco and Amazon and establish itself as a strong player in the market."},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello!

By now we know that business activities such as stra- tegic planning are essential for gaining competitive advantages, but why is brand management important? What has changed in our media environment that makes a traditional consumer goods management tool and construct applicable to media products? In principle, the most essential driver for a branding strategy is the ele- ment of “competition” in a market. When consumers are faced with choices in products, they need a way to identify the one that will best sat- isfy their needs, so suppliers must create identities for their offerings to avoid confusion and reach the target consumers in the marketplace. The tremendous proliferation of media outlets and the continuous fragmen- tation of audiences during the last two decades have created an increas- ingly competitive media marketplace. The same element of “competition” that propelled the introduction of branding practices in consumer goods industries is now facilitating the application of brand management in many media industries as media firms race to establish clear and memo- rable brand images in a growingly complicated marketplace filled with infinite content offered by broadcasters, cablecasters, Internet, telcos, and DBS. In fact, the branding process is consistent with the “experience good” characteristic of media products: It is difficult for consumers to es- timate the quality of a new media product such as movies or television se- ries before they actually experience it. In order to avoid risks (e.g., money and time) related to purchasing and consuming these products, consum- ers may depend on brands and their associated images and expectations as one of the initial decision factors (Chang, 2004). WHAT IS BRANDING? Fundamentally, a brand is a name, term, sign, symbol, package design, or combination of these elements intended to identify and distinguish a product or service from its competitors. A “brand” is different from a “product” because, although it is designed to satisfy the same basic need as an unbranded product, it also adds certain rational, tangible and/or emotional, intangible attributes to a product so it is perceived to be dif- ferent from an unbranded product in its expected performance and ben- efits. In essence, these brand-related elements are supposed to communicate thoughts and feelings that enhance the value of a product beyond its product category and basic functional value. For instance, the brand New York Times represents a certain level of news reporting and editorial quality that distinguishes it from its competitors. Why are brands valuable? Keller (1998) succinctly listed a number of reasons why brands matter to both consumers and producers. He sug- gested that brands help consumers identify the source of a product, as- sign responsibility to product makers, reduce risk and search cost, signal quality, form relationships between consumers and product makers, and serve as a symbolic device. Brands also provide producers a means of identification to simplify handling or tracing, a way to legally protect unique features, a tool to signal “quality” levels, a means to endow prod- ucts with special associations, and a source of competitive advantages and thus the final financial returns. All of these benefits are applicable in the context of media products. For example, the brand name “PBS” is strongly associated with the images of “trust” and “quality” in the mind of television audiences (Chan-Olmsted & Y. Kim, 2002). The brand name “Discovery” has been used by its corporate owner in the introduction of various new cable channels and even retail learning products. There are various strategic aspects that a firm can pursue to engage competitors: marketing, production, financial, technological, and man- agerial. Whereas the topics in strategic management discussed in earlier chapters mainly dealt with managerial competition strategies, the de- velopment and maintenance of brands are traditionally a part of a mar- keting program. Because a brand is built over time, branding is also a continuous process of marketing activities that should be designed to reflect the changing life cycle of a product and its environment. Various marketing researchers have tried to explain the nature of brands and branding activities. Donahue (1995) suggested that a valuable brand has to be relevant and distinctive and brand-building activities may in- clude demonstrations, seminars, shows, effective service material, pub- lic relations, advertising, direct marketing, and promotions that extend positioning. Murphy (1987) indicated that branding consists of the de- velopment and maintenance of sets of product attributes and values that are coherent, appropriate, distinctive, protectable, and appealing to consumers. Cowley (1991) also stated that sources of added value in branding include a guarantee of authenticity, the promise of perfor- mance, the value of reassurance, and the transformation of experience (the subjective experience of using a brand, and differentiation or brand personality). The value of authenticity and promise of positive experi- ence seem to be especially important for media content providers in an increasingly crowded marketplace. In fact, Davis (1995) suggested that brand management should be viewed as a strategic management pro- cess to maximize the long-term value of a brand. The role of branding is often misunderstood by companies that have not had a traditional mar- keting focus. Many companies hire senior-level packaged goods mar- keters and expect quick fixes (Bissell, 1998). Branding is seen simply as a new “design and control” function to quickly clean up corporate iden- tity and wrap an existing product or service into a nice, neat package. Bissell reiterated the importance of management commitment in treat- ing branding as part of a firm’s fundamental strategic process and daily tactical operations. On the surface, the branding and brand management notions ap- pear to be less applicable to media industries due to many media prod- ucts’ intangible, nonpreservable nature, the possibility of group consumption, the selection of a content product based on the merits of individual units (e.g., movies), the lack of actual purchasing action (and risk) for advertising-supported content products, and the absence of easily identifiable product logos. In addition, prior to the 1990s, most media markets were relatively uncompetitive; media products were based on distinct technologies consumed in separate markets with distinctive consumer behaviors (McDowell, 2006). Nevertheless, the landscape of media industries has changed dramatically. We now have a converging media marketplace enabled by digital technologies and new network conduits such as the Internet; the potential for pro- viding additional new media services; and a fragmented, multitasking audience. These environmental developments present an unprece- dented need for differentiation using all possible means. With varying degrees, branding or brand management can enhance a media con- sumer’s association, perception, and expectation of a media product. For example, a radio station that has established a family-friendly brand may increase its chance of being selected by a certain segment of the audience. And a signature local news program can easily become a proprietary brand asset for a TV station. Although branding offers media firms opportunities for differentia- tion, the aforementioned media characteristics still present some chal- lenges in this process. In addition, there are general obstacles associated with the branding approach. For example, the essence of branding as de- veloping something of value often conflicts with the current accounting system, which treats a brand as an expense rather than asset. The neces- sary long-term orientation of brand building also conflicts with the gen- erally high personnel turnover in businesses. Finally, the integrated nature of brand building (i.e., the involvement of production, sales, mar- keting, etc.) often conflicts with the reality of a segmented organizational structure and single-dimension advertising focuses (Kapferer, 1992). BRAND MANAGEMENT CONCEPTS Brand management has become a major subfield within the marketing discipline over the years, infusing it with various theoretical constructs and analytical frameworks. Many of these conceptual building blocks are useful for analyzing media products and thus are reviewed next. Brand Identity Brand identity encompasses two dimensions: one that indicates the out- ward expression of a brand, including the tangible elements such as names, symbols, logos, slogans, and packaging that can be used to rec- ognize a brand; and the other that symbolizes the brand’s differentiated characteristics, including the unique set of associations that represent what the brand stands for and would do for customers. The process is the linking of differentiated features and attributes of a product or ser- vice to anticipated perceived benefits based on customers’ values and be- liefs. In a way, brand identity is like clothing to a product in that it can set one apart in a crowd as well as say something about the person who chooses the brand. It is important to note that brand identity is some- thing that is formulated and worked on by the firm, whereas another relevant concept, brand image, is based on consumer perception (i.e., formulated by the consumer). In other words, image is the result of how consumers interpret the brand identity put forth by a firm, amid noises and personal circumstances. Time can also change the identity of a brand as it gradually acquires other meanings from associations with things that are both intended and unintended by its firm. So how does a firm successfully develop a brand identity for a prod- uct? Kapferer (1992) suggested that brand identities should be formu- lated on the basis of three qualities: durability, coherence, and realism (as opposed to idealism or opportunism). Keller (1998) listed five criteria in choosing brand elements to form a brand identity: memorability, meaningfulness, transferability (both culturally and geographically), adaptability, and protectability (both legally and competitively). Cable networks offer some excellent examples of establishing and modifying a media brand over time. For example, Discovery Communications Inc.’s TLC channel began as an education network that offered foreign-lan- guage instruction, an SAT review course, and other adult personal-en- richment series with the name of “The Learning Channel” (Eastman, 1993). With the success of its reality-based series such as Trading Spaces and its continuous programming transformation to this particular genre, it is now renamed as “TLC” with a “Life Unscripted” slogan and logo. Finally, a firm may look to various sources to define a brand’s identity. Kapferer also suggested some sources of identities: (a) the ac- tual product or service through which the brand may display its uniqueness (e.g., NASA Television), (b) a brand name through which the brand may convey its characteristics (e.g., The Cartoon Network), (c) brand characters and symbols through which the brand may represent its traits and features in the etymological sense (e.g., PBS and its logo), (d) trademarks and logos through which a brand may reflect its person- ality and value (e.g., Playboy TV Networks), (e) geographical and his- torical roots through which a brand may paint its individuality and competence (e.g., BBC America cable channel), and (f) advertising through which a brand may develop or reinvent identities as conceived by its firm (e.g., TLC cable channel). Brand Knowledge: Awareness, Association, and Image Although a brand identity may be the strategic goal for a brand, the re- sultant brand image of what actually resides in the minds of consumers about the brand could be very different from that goal. According to Keller (1998), such a discrepancy is due to the differential brand knowl- edge structures of individual consumers as reflected by the levels of brand awareness and brand image (i.e., the strength, favorability, and uniqueness of brand associations) of that product. Creating “brand awareness” is often considered the first step of branding. Brand awareness can be defined as the degree to which a tar- get audience is able to identify a brand among others and even recall its promise. As a typical measure of marketing communications effective- ness, awareness may be assessed unaidedly or aidedly (i.e., when a brand name is recognized among others that are listed or identified). Conceptually, brand awareness is hierarchical. Keller (1993) suggested that brand awareness consists of brand recognition, which communi- cates consumers’ ability to verify prior exposure to the brand when given the brand as a cue, and brand recall, which relates consumers’ ability to retrieve the brand from memory when given cues such as ben- efits, usage/purchase situations, or product categories. Another related concept is “top-of-the-mind” awareness, which denotes the highest level of brand awareness for a brand because the brand is the first to come to mind when consumers recall a brand relating to a certain qual- ity. It is evident that brand awareness is fundamental to a brand’s suc- cess. For example, by increasing the brand awareness of HBO On Demand (a video-on-demand programming service offered by HBO), HBO raises the potential that an audience might include this service in his or her viewing consideration list. By increasing the brand awareness of Movielink.Com (a broadband movie download service), Movielink raises the probability that an audience might choose this service because it is perceived to be more established and familiar. This power of aware- ness is especially significant for new media products that consumers have not experienced or have no prior knowledge to relate to. Finally, by increasing the brand awareness of Bravo Cable Network, its owner, NBC, would have an easier time cultivating the associations that make up Bravo’s brand image. As indicated previously, brand image rests in the consumers’ minds and is developed through brand associations. Consequently, brand im- age may be defined as a unique set of associations within the target cus- tomers’ minds that characterizes what the brand stands for and implies the brand’s promise to them. For users of the brand, the image is also in- fluenced by their experience with the brand. For nonusers, the image is largely shaped by their impressions of the brand amid personal beliefs and attitudes. Keller (1998) identified three main types of brand associa- tions with increasing abstraction: attributes (product related or nonproduct related such as price and usage imagery), benefits (func- tional, symbolic, or experiential), and attitudes formed on the basis of beliefs about a product’s attributes and benefits. Note that a brand im- age is influenced not only by the types of associations but also by the strength, uniqueness, and favorability of the associations (Keller, 1998). For instance, Fox News has established relatively strong and unique brand associations based on certain attributes and benefits (e.g., conser- vative commentaries such as the O’Reilly Factor program). The value of its brand image, however, is largely dependent on an audience seg- ment’s favorability or desirability toward those associations.","output":"Summary: Title: Brand Management in Media Industries This chapter explores the importance of brand management in media industries.

Noen av disse grunnene inkluderer: 1. Resultater: I løpet av de siste årene har Manchester United ikke oppnådd de samme sportslige resultatene som tidligere. Klubben har ikke vunnet Premier League siden 2013 og har ikke kommet langt i europeiske turneringer. 2. Spillestil: Noen kritikere mener at spillestilen til Manchester United under ledelse av manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær har vært for defensiv og kjedelig. Dette har ført til lavere underholdningsverdi for fansen. 3. Overgangspolitikk: Klubben har gjort flere dyre og mislykkede overføringer i løpet av de siste årene. Noen spillere som har blitt signert har ikke levd opp til forventningene, og dette har påvirket klubbens suksess på banen. 4. Stabilitet: United har hatt flere managerbytter siden Alex Ferguson gikk av som manager i 2013. Dette har påvirket stabiliteten og kontinuiteten i klubben, og har ført til endrede spill- og treningsmetoder. Det er viktig å merke seg at denne oppfatningen kan variere fra person til person, og at det alltid er en subjektiv vurdering basert på individuelle preferanser og meninger.

Gjeldsfinansiering: Da Glazer-familien kjøpte klubben i 2005, benyttet de seg av betydelig gjeldsfinansiering for å gjennomføre oppkjøpet. Dette førte til en høy gjeldsbyrde for klubben, som påvirket klubbens økonomi og evne til å investere i spillertroppen. 2. Manglende investeringer: Kritikere hevder at Glazer-familien har prioritert profitt fremfor sportslig suksess. Dette har resultert i begrensede investeringer i spillertroppen og manglende evne til å konkurrere på toppnivå i europeisk fotball. 3. Kommerisialisering: Glazer-familien har økt klubbens kommersialisering betydelig, noe som har ført til økt fokus på sponsoravtaler, markedsføring og økonomiske gevinster. Dette har imidlertid ført til bekymringer om at kommersielle interesser prioriteres over sportslig suksess. 4. Fjern eierskap: Noen fans mener at Glazer-familien er for distansert fra klubbens kulturelle og historiske verdier. Dette har ført til økt misnøye blant supportersamfunnet og en oppfatning av at eierne ikke forstår klubbens identitet og fansens behov. Det er viktig å huske at dette er en subjektiv mening og at det alltid vil være forskjellige meninger blant fans og kritikere.

The tremendous proliferation of media outlets and the continuous fragmentation of audiences during the last two decades have created an increasingly competitive media marketplace. The branding process is consistent with the “experience good” characteristic of media products. In order to avoid risks related to purchasing and consuming these products, consumers may depend on brands and their associated images and expectations as one of the initial decision factors. A brand is a name, term, sign, symbol, package design, or combination of these elements intended to identify and distinguish a product or service from its competitors. It adds certain rational, tangible and/or emotional, intangible attributes to a product so it is perceived to be different from an unbranded product in its expected performance and benefits. Brands help consumers identify the source of a product, assign responsibility to product makers, reduce risk and search cost, signal quality, form relationships between consumers and product makers, and serve as a symbolic device. Brands also provide producers a means of identification to simplify handling or tracing, a way to legally protect unique features, a tool to signal “quality” levels, a means to endow products with special associations, and a source of competitive advantages and thus the final financial returns. There are various strategic aspects that a firm can pursue to engage competitors. Brand management is traditionally a part of a marketing program, as a brand is built over time. Branding is also a continuous process of marketing activities that should be designed to reflect the changing life cycle of a product and its environment. Brand identity encompasses the outward expression of a brand, including the tangible elements such as names, symbols, logos, slogans, and packaging, as well as the brand’s differentiated characteristics and unique set of associations that represent what the brand stands for and would do for customers. Brand knowledge is an important factor in shaping brand image. It includes brand awareness, which is the degree to which a target audience is able to identify and recall a brand, and brand image, which is the unique set of associations within the consumers’ minds that characterizes what the brand stands for and implies the brand’s promise to them. Increasing brand awareness is fundamental to a brand’s success, especially for new media products. Brand image is also influenced by brand associations, which can be attributes, benefits, or attitudes formed on the basis of beliefs about a product’s attributes and benefits. While the branding and brand management notions may appear less applicable to media industries due to their intangible nature and other factors, the landscape of media industries has changed dramatically. Branding or brand management can enhance a media consumer’s association, perception, and expectation of a media product. Overall, brand management concepts play an important role in shaping the success of media products and differentiating them in a competitive marketplace."},{"instruction":"خیلی داری اذیت میکنی","output":"متاسفم اگر شما را اذیت می کنم. آیا می توانم به شما در هرچه بهتر فهمیدن پاراگراف ها و معنای آنها کمک کنم؟"},{"instruction":"","output":"Hello!

By now we know that business activities such as stra- tegic planning are essential for gaining competitive advantages, but why is brand management important? What has changed in our media environment that makes a traditional consumer goods management tool and construct applicable to media products? In principle, the most essential driver for a branding strategy is the ele- ment of “competition” in a market. When consumers are faced with choices in products, they need a way to identify the one that will best sat- isfy their needs, so suppliers must create identities for their offerings to avoid confusion and reach the target consumers in the marketplace. The tremendous proliferation of media outlets and the continuous fragmen- tation of audiences during the last two decades have created an increas- ingly competitive media marketplace. The same element of “competition” that propelled the introduction of branding practices in consumer goods industries is now facilitating the application of brand management in many media industries as media firms race to establish clear and memo- rable brand images in a growingly complicated marketplace filled with infinite content offered by broadcasters, cablecasters, Internet, telcos, and DBS. In fact, the branding process is consistent with the “experience good” characteristic of media products: It is difficult for consumers to es- timate the quality of a new media product such as movies or television se- ries before they actually experience it. In order to avoid risks (e.g., money and time) related to purchasing and consuming these products, consum- ers may depend on brands and their associated images and expectations as one of the initial decision factors (Chang, 2004). WHAT IS BRANDING? Fundamentally, a brand is a name, term, sign, symbol, package design, or combination of these elements intended to identify and distinguish a product or service from its competitors. A “brand” is different from a “product” because, although it is designed to satisfy the same basic need as an unbranded product, it also adds certain rational, tangible and/or emotional, intangible attributes to a product so it is perceived to be dif- ferent from an unbranded product in its expected performance and ben- efits. In essence, these brand-related elements are supposed to communicate thoughts and feelings that enhance the value of a product beyond its product category and basic functional value. For instance, the brand New York Times represents a certain level of news reporting and editorial quality that distinguishes it from its competitors. Why are brands valuable? Keller (1998) succinctly listed a number of reasons why brands matter to both consumers and producers. He sug- gested that brands help consumers identify the source of a product, as- sign responsibility to product makers, reduce risk and search cost, signal quality, form relationships between consumers and product makers, and serve as a symbolic device. Brands also provide producers a means of identification to simplify handling or tracing, a way to legally protect unique features, a tool to signal “quality” levels, a means to endow prod- ucts with special associations, and a source of competitive advantages and thus the final financial returns. All of these benefits are applicable in the context of media products. For example, the brand name “PBS” is strongly associated with the images of “trust” and “quality” in the mind of television audiences (Chan-Olmsted & Y. Kim, 2002). The brand name “Discovery” has been used by its corporate owner in the introduction of various new cable channels and even retail learning products. There are various strategic aspects that a firm can pursue to engage competitors: marketing, production, financial, technological, and man- agerial. Whereas the topics in strategic management discussed in earlier chapters mainly dealt with managerial competition strategies, the de- velopment and maintenance of brands are traditionally a part of a mar- keting program. Because a brand is built over time, branding is also a continuous process of marketing activities that should be designed to reflect the changing life cycle of a product and its environment. Various marketing researchers have tried to explain the nature of brands and branding activities. Donahue (1995) suggested that a valuable brand has to be relevant and distinctive and brand-building activities may in- clude demonstrations, seminars, shows, effective service material, pub- lic relations, advertising, direct marketing, and promotions that extend positioning. Murphy (1987) indicated that branding consists of the de- velopment and maintenance of sets of product attributes and values that are coherent, appropriate, distinctive, protectable, and appealing to consumers. Cowley (1991) also stated that sources of added value in branding include a guarantee of authenticity, the promise of perfor- mance, the value of reassurance, and the transformation of experience (the subjective experience of using a brand, and differentiation or brand personality). The value of authenticity and promise of positive experi- ence seem to be especially important for media content providers in an increasingly crowded marketplace. In fact, Davis (1995) suggested that brand management should be viewed as a strategic management pro- cess to maximize the long-term value of a brand. The role of branding is often misunderstood by companies that have not had a traditional mar- keting focus. Many companies hire senior-level packaged goods mar- keters and expect quick fixes (Bissell, 1998). Branding is seen simply as a new “design and control” function to quickly clean up corporate iden- tity and wrap an existing product or service into a nice, neat package. Bissell reiterated the importance of management commitment in treat- ing branding as part of a firm’s fundamental strategic process and daily tactical operations. On the surface, the branding and brand management notions ap- pear to be less applicable to media industries due to many media prod- ucts’ intangible, nonpreservable nature, the possibility of group consumption, the selection of a content product based on the merits of individual units (e.g., movies), the lack of actual purchasing action (and risk) for advertising-supported content products, and the absence of easily identifiable product logos. In addition, prior to the 1990s, most media markets were relatively uncompetitive; media products were based on distinct technologies consumed in separate markets with distinctive consumer behaviors (McDowell, 2006). Nevertheless, the landscape of media industries has changed dramatically. We now have a converging media marketplace enabled by digital technologies and new network conduits such as the Internet; the potential for pro- viding additional new media services; and a fragmented, multitasking audience. These environmental developments present an unprece- dented need for differentiation using all possible means. With varying degrees, branding or brand management can enhance a media con- sumer’s association, perception, and expectation of a media product. For example, a radio station that has established a family-friendly brand may increase its chance of being selected by a certain segment of the audience. And a signature local news program can easily become a proprietary brand asset for a TV station. Although branding offers media firms opportunities for differentia- tion, the aforementioned media characteristics still present some chal- lenges in this process. In addition, there are general obstacles associated with the branding approach. For example, the essence of branding as de- veloping something of value often conflicts with the current accounting system, which treats a brand as an expense rather than asset. The neces- sary long-term orientation of brand building also conflicts with the gen- erally high personnel turnover in businesses. Finally, the integrated nature of brand building (i.e., the involvement of production, sales, mar- keting, etc.) often conflicts with the reality of a segmented organizational structure and single-dimension advertising focuses (Kapferer, 1992). BRAND MANAGEMENT CONCEPTS Brand management has become a major subfield within the marketing discipline over the years, infusing it with various theoretical constructs and analytical frameworks. Many of these conceptual building blocks are useful for analyzing media products and thus are reviewed next. Brand Identity Brand identity encompasses two dimensions: one that indicates the out- ward expression of a brand, including the tangible elements such as names, symbols, logos, slogans, and packaging that can be used to rec- ognize a brand; and the other that symbolizes the brand’s differentiated characteristics, including the unique set of associations that represent what the brand stands for and would do for customers. The process is the linking of differentiated features and attributes of a product or ser- vice to anticipated perceived benefits based on customers’ values and be- liefs. In a way, brand identity is like clothing to a product in that it can set one apart in a crowd as well as say something about the person who chooses the brand. It is important to note that brand identity is some- thing that is formulated and worked on by the firm, whereas another relevant concept, brand image, is based on consumer perception (i.e., formulated by the consumer). In other words, image is the result of how consumers interpret the brand identity put forth by a firm, amid noises and personal circumstances. Time can also change the identity of a brand as it gradually acquires other meanings from associations with things that are both intended and unintended by its firm. So how does a firm successfully develop a brand identity for a prod- uct? Kapferer (1992) suggested that brand identities should be formu- lated on the basis of three qualities: durability, coherence, and realism (as opposed to idealism or opportunism). Keller (1998) listed five criteria in choosing brand elements to form a brand identity: memorability, meaningfulness, transferability (both culturally and geographically), adaptability, and protectability (both legally and competitively). Cable networks offer some excellent examples of establishing and modifying a media brand over time. For example, Discovery Communications Inc.’s TLC channel began as an education network that offered foreign-lan- guage instruction, an SAT review course, and other adult personal-en- richment series with the name of “The Learning Channel” (Eastman, 1993). With the success of its reality-based series such as Trading Spaces and its continuous programming transformation to this particular genre, it is now renamed as “TLC” with a “Life Unscripted” slogan and logo. Finally, a firm may look to various sources to define a brand’s identity. Kapferer also suggested some sources of identities: (a) the ac- tual product or service through which the brand may display its uniqueness (e.g., NASA Television), (b) a brand name through which the brand may convey its characteristics (e.g., The Cartoon Network), (c) brand characters and symbols through which the brand may represent its traits and features in the etymological sense (e.g., PBS and its logo), (d) trademarks and logos through which a brand may reflect its person- ality and value (e.g., Playboy TV Networks), (e) geographical and his- torical roots through which a brand may paint its individuality and competence (e.g., BBC America cable channel), and (f) advertising through which a brand may develop or reinvent identities as conceived by its firm (e.g., TLC cable channel). Brand Knowledge: Awareness, Association, and Image Although a brand identity may be the strategic goal for a brand, the re- sultant brand image of what actually resides in the minds of consumers about the brand could be very different from that goal. According to Keller (1998), such a discrepancy is due to the differential brand knowl- edge structures of individual consumers as reflected by the levels of brand awareness and brand image (i.e., the strength, favorability, and uniqueness of brand associations) of that product. Creating “brand awareness” is often considered the first step of branding. Brand awareness can be defined as the degree to which a tar- get audience is able to identify a brand among others and even recall its promise. As a typical measure of marketing communications effective- ness, awareness may be assessed unaidedly or aidedly (i.e., when a brand name is recognized among others that are listed or identified). Conceptually, brand awareness is hierarchical. Keller (1993) suggested that brand awareness consists of brand recognition, which communi- cates consumers’ ability to verify prior exposure to the brand when given the brand as a cue, and brand recall, which relates consumers’ ability to retrieve the brand from memory when given cues such as ben- efits, usage/purchase situations, or product categories. Another related concept is “top-of-the-mind” awareness, which denotes the highest level of brand awareness for a brand because the brand is the first to come to mind when consumers recall a brand relating to a certain qual- ity. It is evident that brand awareness is fundamental to a brand’s suc- cess. For example, by increasing the brand awareness of HBO On Demand (a video-on-demand programming service offered by HBO), HBO raises the potential that an audience might include this service in his or her viewing consideration list. By increasing the brand awareness of Movielink.Com (a broadband movie download service), Movielink raises the probability that an audience might choose this service because it is perceived to be more established and familiar. This power of aware- ness is especially significant for new media products that consumers have not experienced or have no prior knowledge to relate to. Finally, by increasing the brand awareness of Bravo Cable Network, its owner, NBC, would have an easier time cultivating the associations that make up Bravo’s brand image. As indicated previously, brand image rests in the consumers’ minds and is developed through brand associations. Consequently, brand im- age may be defined as a unique set of associations within the target cus- tomers’ minds that characterizes what the brand stands for and implies the brand’s promise to them. For users of the brand, the image is also in- fluenced by their experience with the brand. For nonusers, the image is largely shaped by their impressions of the brand amid personal beliefs and attitudes. Keller (1998) identified three main types of brand associa- tions with increasing abstraction: attributes (product related or nonproduct related such as price and usage imagery), benefits (func- tional, symbolic, or experiential), and attitudes formed on the basis of beliefs about a product’s attributes and benefits. Note that a brand im- age is influenced not only by the types of associations but also by the strength, uniqueness, and favorability of the associations (Keller, 1998). For instance, Fox News has established relatively strong and unique brand associations based on certain attributes and benefits (e.g., conser- vative commentaries such as the O’Reilly Factor program). The value of its brand image, however, is largely dependent on an audience seg- ment’s favorability or desirability toward those associations.","output":"Moving from strategic management to “brands,” this chapter reviews major brand management concepts and theoretical frameworks such as brand knowledge and brand equity, discusses how these concepts and frameworks might apply to media products in the context of a changing marketplace, and provides examples of brand management practices in media industries. The Importance of Brand Management in Media Industries In a competitive market, brands are essential for consumers to identify and choose products that best satisfy their needs. With the proliferation of media outlets and the fragmentation of audiences, the media marketplace has become increasingly competitive as well. This has led media firms to adopt brand management practices in order to establish clear and memorable brand images and differentiate themselves in a crowded marketplace filled with infinite content. Brands become especially important for media products as consumers rely on them to estimate the quality of new media products before experiencing them. Branding also helps consumers reduce the risks related to purchasing and consuming media products. What is Branding? A brand is a name, term, sign, symbol, package design, or combination of these elements that distinguishes a product or service from its competitors. Brands provide various benefits to both consumers and producers. For consumers, brands help identify the source of a product, assign responsibility to product makers, reduce risk and search cost, signal quality, form relationships between consumers and product makers, and serve as a symbolic device. For producers, brands provide means of identification, simplify handling or tracing, legally protect unique features, signal quality levels, endow products with special associations, and source of competitive advantages and financial returns. These benefits are applicable to media products as well. The Challenges and Opportunities of Branding in Media Industries While branding may seem less applicable to media industries due to the intangible and nonpreservable nature of many media products, as well as factors like group consumption and lack of identifiable product logos, the landscape of media industries has changed dramatically. Converging media marketplace, new technologies, and fragmented audience present an unprecedented need for differentiation. Branding can enhance a media consumer's association, perception, and expectation of a media product. However, there are challenges associated with branding in media industries, such as conflicts with accounting systems, high personnel turnover, and segmented organizational structures. Brand Management Concepts Brand Identity: Brand identity encompasses the outward expression of a brand, including tangible elements like names, symbols, and logos, as well as the brand's differentiated characteristics and associations. Successful brand identities should be durable, coherent, and realistic. Brand Knowledge: Brand knowledge consists of brand awareness and brand image. Brand awareness is the degree to which a target audience can identify and recall a brand. Brand image is the unique set of associations in consumers' minds that characterize what the brand stands for and implies the brand's promise. Overall, brand management plays a crucial role in media industries by helping firms establish clear and memorable brand images, differentiate themselves in a competitive marketplace, and enhance consumers' association, perception, and expectation of media products."},{"instruction":"modify this section: She did the project work well showing good attitude and regular attendance.

Разработка идет под windows.","output":"Для реализации возможности нажатия клавиши ESC для завершения программы в Windows на языке C++ можно воспользоваться функциями WinAPI для проверки состояния клавиатуры. Одним из способов является использование функции \`GetAsyncKeyState\` из библиотеки \`<windows.h>\`, которая позволяет определить была ли нажата определенная клавиша. Вот пример программы, которая запрашивает у пользователя ввод значений в бесконечном цикле и позволяет завершить программу путем нажатия клавиши ESC: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <windows.h> // Для работы с WinAPI int main() { int input; bool running = true; while (running) { if (GetAsyncKeyState(VK_ESCAPE)) { // Проверка нажатия ESC std::cout << \\"Выход из программы...\\" << std::endl; break; } std::cout << \\"Введите число (или нажмите ESC для выхода): \\"; std::cin >> input; // Если поток находится в ошибочном состоянии (например, из-за нечислового ввода) if (std::cin.fail()) { std::cin.clear(); // Очистить состояние ошибки std::cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits<std::streamsize>::max(), 'n'); // Пропустить некорректный ввод } // Пример обработки ввода std::cout << \\"Вы ввели: \\" << input << std::endl; // Искусственная задержка для упрощения нажатия ESC Sleep(100); } return 0; } \`\`\` Обратите внимание на следующие моменты: 1. Функция \`GetAsyncKeyState(VK_ESCAPE)\` проверяет состояние клавиши ESC (Virtual-Key Code – VK_ESCAPE). Если клавиша нажата, функция возвращает ненулевое значение. 2. После проверки состояния клавиши ESC программа спрашивает у пользователя ввод числа. Если вместо числа будет введен текст или другие символы, поток \`cin\` переходит в ошибочное состояние, которое затем необходимо очистить с помощью \`cin.clear()\` и \`cin.ignore()\`. 3. Использование \`Sleep(100)\` введено для создания небольшой задержки между проверками состояния клавиш. Это позволяет избежать множественного срабатывания условия при долгом удержании клавиши. Важно также отметить, что использование функции \`GetAsyncKeyState\` требует обработки нажатий клавиш вне стандартных потоков ввода, таких как \`cin\`, и может быть не идеальным вариантом для всех ситуаций. В частности, это связано с особенностями работы консольных приложений Windows и их взаимодействия с системой. При проверке клавиши во время ожидания ввода через \`cin\` может возникнуть конфликт. Поэтому перед применением подхода важно тщательно протестировать программу на предмет таких конфликтов."},{"instruction":"как сделать это через _kbhit ?","output":"Функция \`_kbhit()\` из библиотеки \`<conio.h>\` используется для определения нажатия клавиш без блокировки программы, что позволяет проверять, была ли нажата какая-либо клавиша, не ожидая ввода от пользователя.

Если клавиша была нажата, \`_getch()\` считывает символ, не выводя его на экран. Мы проверяем, является ли этот символ клавишей ESC и завершаем цикл, если это так. Важно отметить, что \`_kbhit()\` и \`_getch()\` являются специфичными для Windows и работают только с консольными приложениями, используя библиотеку \`<conio.h>\`, которая не является стандартной частью ISO C++ и может отсутствовать в некоторых компиляторах на других платформах."},{"instruction":"как сделать возможность выход по нажатию esc в этом коде: #include <iostream> #include <string> #include <cmath> #include <sstream> #include <cstdlib> #include <conio.h> using namespace std; // Функция для проверки корректности строки как числа с плавающей точкой double getValidatedInput(const string& promt) { string input; double value; while (true) { cout << promt; getline(cin, input); // Считываем строку с вводом пользователя stringstream stream(input); // Попытка преобразовать строку в число if (stream >> value) { char remaining; if (!(stream >> remaining)) { // Убедимся, что после числа нет других символов break; // Ввод корректен, выходим из цикла } } // Если ввод некорректен, выводим сообщение об ошибке и просим ввести число еще раз cout << \\"Используйте только цифры! \\" << endl; } return value; // Возвращаем корректное число, введенное пользователем } int main() { char choice; do { setlocale(0, \\"\\"); // Поддержка кириллицы cout << \\"Для решения дискриминанта введите значения a, b и c.\\" << endl; // Запрашиваем у пользователя три значения double a = getValidatedInput(\\"Введите A: \\"); double b = getValidatedInput(\\"Введите B: \\"); double c = getValidatedInput(\\"Введите C: \\"); // Решение дисриминанта double d = pow(b, 2) - 4 * a * c; double x, x1, x2; if (d > 0) { x1 = (-b + sqrt(d)) / 2 * a; x2 = (-b - sqrt(d)) / 2 * a; cout << \\"X1 =\\" << x1 << endl; cout << \\"X2 =\\" << x2 << endl; } else if (d == 0) { x = -b / 2 * a; cout << \\"X =\\" << x << endl; } else if (d < 0) { cout << \\"Корней нет!\\" << endl; } cout << \\"Решить заново?

Many studies in advertising effectiveness have focused on investigating the relationships between brand attitudes, attitudes toward advertising, and purchase intention (Heath & Gaeth, 1994; Kalwani & Silk, 1982; MacKenzie & Lutz, 1989). Brand attitudes can be defined as consumers’ overall evalu- ations of a brand, which can be influenced by experience as well as marketing programs (Wilkie, 1990). Ajzen and Fishbein (1980) exam- ined brand attitudes as a predisposition to respond in a consistently favorable or unfavorable manner to a particular brand. Understandably, such a definition implies significant consequences for both consumers’ formation of brand image and purchasing behav- ior. Katz (1960) proposed that consumers actually form brand attitudes based on what the brands can do to help them achieve what they desire. He listed four major functions that consumers often seek from a prod- uct: to satisfy their needs, to allow them to express themselves, to sim- plify decision making, or to eliminate threats or insecurity. Here we are dealing with the multiplicative result of both the functions that are per- ceived to be embedded in a product and personal beliefs of the impor- tance of these functions. To capture the meaning of these abstract attitudinal concepts in a marketing context, Fishbein and Ajzen (1975) proposed a famous expectancy-value model to assess brand attitudes. They stated that brand attitudes are a function of (a) salient beliefs about the attitude object, defined as the subjective probability that the attitude object has each attribute (i.e., strength of association between the brand and the salient attributes or benefits), and (b) the evaluative aspect of these beliefs, defined as the evaluation of each attribute (i.e., the favorability of the salient attributes or benefits). It was also sug- gested that brand attitudes that were formed based on direct behavior or experience are often more influential in the purchasing decision process (Farquhar, 1989). How does the concept of brand attitudes work in the context of media products? The functional theory of attitudes proposed by Katz (1960) is useful to explain the dynamics of consumption choices for media prod- ucts. In fact, it is similar to the utility notions as suggested by the uses and gratification theory in mass communication. A media brand may seek to create associations with certain product-related attributes such as the extensive amount of information offered (e.g., Discovery), non-product-related attributes such as a user (audience) imagery of be- ing young and hip (e.g., MTV), functional benefits such as knowledge obtainment (e.g., PBS), symbolic benefits such as being socially visible and accepted (e.g., ESPN), and experiential benefits such as high sensory entertainment (e.g., a digital cable service). By investigating the func- tions desired by a target audience and how the product delivers that function as perceived by the group, a media firm can assess the effective- ness of its product offering and marketing programs in associating the attributes and benefits with its brand. Brand Extension, Hierarchy, and Portfolio When a brand has acquired a strong, favorable brand image, it is logical that its firm will want to extend the brand’s value to its other busi- nesses. Brand extension is defined as the use of an established brand name for a new product to capitalize on the equity of the existing brand name. Successful brand extensions require marketing strategies that reasonably establish a connection between the new and the old product and transfer the perceived benefit from the old to the new in a meaning- ful continuation of brand identity. Note that established brands are most valuable in those extensions where the perceptions of brand iden- tity are relevant to the potential consumer of the new product. For in- stance, NBC’s extensions to the cable network business, MSNBC and CNBC, seem to provide the consistent content images (upscale and ur- ban) that appeal to the core audience of NBC. Nevertheless, overextensions or wrong extensions of a successful brand can also dam- age the existing brand. Research has shown that a brand extension strategy may lead to cannibalization or dilution of the parent brand (Chakravarti, MacInnis, & Nakamoto, 1990; John, Loken, & Joiner, 1998; Loken & John, 1993). Brand extensions can be grouped into two different categories: line ex- tensions, which extend a brand name vertically by introducing a new product of modifying features (e.g., different attributes, pricing points, or qualities) into the same product category as the parent brand, and cate- gory extensions, which extend a brand name horizontally by introducing a new product into a product category different from that of the parent brand (Kirmani, Sood, & Bridges, 1999). For example, it is a line extension when the Discovery Channel set up another cable network, Discovery Health, whereas it is a category extension when Discovery entered the magazine-publishing business by introducing its Discovery magazine. Several factors have been suggested to motivate line extension strate- gies: customer segmentation, consumer desires, pricing breadth and flexibility (e.g., encouraging customers to trade up to premium prod- ucts), excess capacity, competitive intensity, trade pressure, and short-term sales gain. Kapferer (1992) suggested that the high cost of advertising, a main-brand building tool, has prevented many firms from launching new brands and to opt for brand maintenance instead. In general, a firm may adopt a brand extension strategy to facilitate new-product acceptance and/or provide feedback benefits to the parent brand (Quelch & Kenny, 1999). Specifically, brand extensions may re- duce risk perceived by customers, increase the probability of gaining distribution and trial, increase promotional efficiency, reduce costs of marketing programs, avoid cost of developing a new brand, allow for packaging and labeling efficiencies, and permit consumer variety seek- ing. From the perspective of the parent brand, brand extensions can clar- ify brand meaning, enhance the parent brand image, revitalize the brand, bring new customers into the brand franchise and increase mar- ket coverage, and permit subsequent extensions (Keller, 1998). There are various problems that might be associated with line exten- sions, including lower brand loyalty, oversegmentation (i.e., weaker lines), underexploited product ideas (i.e., the product might warrant a new brand), stagnant category demand, more opportunities for com- petitors, increased costs, and poorer trade relations (Quelch & Kenny, 1999). Keller (1998) also suggested that brand extensions can confuse or frustrate consumers, encounter retailer resistance, hurt the parent brand image, cannibalize sales of the parent brand, diminish identifica- tion with any one product category, dilute brand meaning, or cause the firm to forgo the chance to develop a new, profitable brand. Many studies in this area have focused on finding the factors contrib- uting to successful brand extensions (e.g., Aaker & Keller, 1990; Barwise, 1993; Keller & Aaker, 1992; Rangaswamy, Burke, & Oliva, 1993; Shocker, Srivastava, & Ruekert, 1994; Sunde & Brodie, 1993; Uncles, 1996). Gen- erally, past research related to the role of the parent brand seems to indi- cate that the number of products associated to a brand, the variability among product types represented by a brand name (brand breadth), and the quality variance of products associated to a brand are major explana- tory variables regarding brand extension evaluations (Chang, 2005). There are also studies that emphasize the aspect of the parent-extended brand relationship. It was found that the more common and fewer dis- tinctive associations that exist, the greater the perception of overall simi- larity between the parent and extended brands. Although these similarity judgments could be based on product-related attributes or benefits as well as non-product-related attributes or benefits, they also provide the foundation for value transfer from the parent brand to the extended brand (MacInnis & Nakamoto, 1990). Brand extension is an increasingly popular branding strategy in me- dia industries. Beginning with the practices of movie sequels (e.g., Home Alone 2, the Star Wars trilogy), it is also widely applied in television pro- gramming development and cable network expansions. For example, the success of the program Law and Order prompted the introductions of Law and Order: Special Victims Unit and Law and Order: Criminal Intent. HBO, the Discovery Channel, CNN, and ESPN all have adopted both line and category brand extension strategies. In fact, studies have shown that in 2004, among the 312 cable television networks, approximately 37% of them were brand extensions. In addition, it was found that the use of the brand extension strategy has become very popular since the mid-1990s (Chang, 2005). In essence, the deregulatory environment as well as technological advances have enabled the growth of multiple me- dia outlets (both content and distribution), which offers the opportu- nity of additional brand development. As advertising costs continue to escalate and consumers are bombarded by proliferated media choices, brand extensions seem to be an effective strategy of expansion for many media firms. Brand hierarchy refers to the graphical ordering of brands to examine the number and nature of common and distinctive brand components across a firm’s products, thus identifying the branding relationships and corporate brand portfolios. A brand hierarchy may be composed of a corporate brand (e.g., Time Warner), family brand (e.g., Turner Broad- casting), individual brand (CNN), and modifier (individual item or model; e.g., CNNfn). A number of factors need to be contemplated while designing a brand hierarchy. A firm has to find the best combination of hierarchy levels, the similarities and distinctions between brands, and how these brands should be related so a new brand might leverage the associations with more established brands in the hierarchy while also creating its own meanings (Keller, 1998). Another relevant concept to brand extension is brand portfolio. Simi- lar to corporate strategies, a brand portfolio is a set of brands that a firm offers to consumers in a product category or in the overall market. Brand portfolio strategy is closely related to the type and size of con- sumer segments available in a market. The management of a brand portfolio encompasses the development and monitoring of a firm’s brand holdings over time along a conceptual matrix to achieve the best overall profitability for its stakeholders. Matrix analytical frameworks utilizing aspects such as market share, sales volume, and brand images to map the trends of an individual brand’s positions and thus its subse- quent resource commitments are often adopted in this process. Aaker (2004) stated that a brand portfolio strategy should create relevance, clarity, differentiation, energy, and leverage. Nevertheless, Kumar (2003) argued that companies can often achieve greater economies of scale, corporate growth, and profitability by reducing the number of brands in their portfolios because once any unprofitable brands have been killed off, companies are left with more freedom to invest in the growth of their remaining brands. In the context of media products, the brand portfolio concept is another valuable tool for analyzing the strat- egies of media conglomerates because digitization increasingly offers more expansion opportunities for these media firms. THE VALUE OF BRANDING Brand Equity The goal of branding is to create something of value that would other- wise be unattainable. Brand equity is typically the “value” that a firm aims to generate with its marketing programs for a brand. Brand equity is therefore defined as the accrued marketing and financial value, both tangible and intangible, that a brand adds to a product or service as a re- sult of a combination of factors such as the awareness, loyalty, per- ceived quality, images, and emotions that consumers associate with the brand name. Keller (1991) provided a conceptual framework of what brands mean to consumers and what this implies for marketing strate- gies. He conceptualized brand equity from the perspective of the individ- ual consumer. This customer-based brand equity occurs when the consumer is familiar with the brand and holds some favorable, strong, and unique brand associations in memory. Keller proposed that brand equity is closely related to two dimensions of a brand: brand awareness or familiarity, which includes brand recall and brand recognition; and brand image, which is a combination of the types of brand association and favorability, strength, and uniqueness of brand associations. To clarify the nature of branding, Aaker (1991) also stressed that brand eq- uity can go both ways because it is a set of brand assets and liabilities linked to a brand and its name and symbol that adds to or subtracts from the value provided by a product or service to a customer. The assets and liabilities can be classified into five categories: brand loyalty, name awareness, perceived quality, brand associations, and other proprietary brand assets such as patents and trademarks. Brand equity brings forth a variety of values. First of all, it allows a brand to charge a premium price compared to competitors with less brand equity, thus contributing to profitability. Brand equity also maintains higher awareness of the product, reduces perceived risk, sim- plifies the decision process for low-involvement products, helps brand extension efforts, increases the probability of being included in a con- sumer’s set of brand considerations, and offers a strong defense against new products and new competitors. For example, the strong brand eq- uity of the Wall Street Journal has contributed to its financial perfor- mance, subscription rates, and defense against new financial news competitors. The fact that the Discovery Channel was ranked as the top brand for overall quality by the EquiTrend brand study for eight consec- utive years since 1997 may explain some of Discovery’s expansions into retailing and additional cable networks. Brand equity has been the focus of marketing research and advertis- ing research since the early 1990s (Aaker, 1991; Aaker & Biel, 1992; Aaker & Jacobson, 1994; Cobb-Walgren, Ruble, & Donthu, 1995). In general, the topic of brand equity is investigated from either a customer- or firm-based perspective. Whereas customer-based brand equity stud- ies examine the theories and practices that address how consumers de- velop their brand awareness and knowledge, how different marketing programs impact these consumer mindsets, and the relationship be- tween brand awareness/image and behavior, firm-based equity studies emphasize the relationship between marketing programs and equity, the management of brand portfolios or hierarchy, and the evaluation of brand equity with financial valuation such as return on investment (ROI). As discussed earlier, the financial evaluation of brands is a diffi- cult subject because of the current accounting practices that regard brands as expenses rather than assets. The typical financial reporting principle is also inconsistent with the sometimes subjective evaluations of brand value, which are inherently rooted in brand concepts such as identities and images. Nevertheless, Kapferer (1992) suggested that fi- nancial evaluations of brands can be based on costs, comparable market value, or potential earnings. Specifically, a brand’s value may be deter- mined by (a) historical costs, which include all developments, market- ing, advertising, and other communication costs, and (b) replacement costs, which are the estimated costs of re-creating the brand of focus. As we can see, there are a lot of assumptions that would have to be made on the sources of brand value and performance with such an approach. The market value method, on the other hand, determines the value of a brand in reference to the value of similar brands up for purchase. Al- though it might be a useful way of gauging a media brand’s value given that there are many mergers and acquisitions of media properties now- adays, it is important to note that the purchase value is not really the current value of the brand but the anticipated value of the brand when the purchaser uses it. In terms of valuating by potential earnings, Kapferer explained that a firm would have to first isolate the net revenue brought in by the brand and then predict its future cash flows. Because of the difficulties of evaluating brand equity using these firm-based ap- proaches, the value of most media brands are assessed from a cus- tomer-based perspective such as the evaluation of brand knowledge (brand awareness and/or image)(e.g., radio stations’ perceptual/posi- tioning studies), brand attitude (e.g., focus group assessment of atti- tudes), or even the resultant brand behavior (e.g., ratings).","output":"Brand Attitudes Brand attitudes are consumers’ overall evaluations of a brand that can be influenced by experience and marketing programs. Consumers form brand attitudes based on what the brand can do for them, such as satisfying their needs or allowing them to express themselves. Brand attitudes are influenced by salient beliefs about the brand and the evaluation of these beliefs. Brand attitudes formed based on direct behavior or experience are often more influential in the purchasing decision process. Brand Extension, Hierarchy, and Portfolio Brand extension refers to using an established brand name for a new product to capitalize on the existing brand equity. Successful brand extensions require establishing a connection between the old and new products and transferring perceived benefits. Brand extensions can be line extensions, introducing new products with modifications to the same product category, or category extensions, introducing new products in a different category. Factors motivating line extension strategies include customer segmentation, pricing flexibility, competitive intensity, trade pressure, and short-term sales gain. Brand extensions can clarify brand meaning, enhance the parent brand image, and bring new customers to the brand franchise. Brand hierarchy refers to the graphical ordering of brands to examine the relationships and portfolios of a firm's brands. It includes corporate brands, family brands, individual brands, and modifiers. Designing a brand hierarchy involves finding the best combination of levels and how the brands should be related to leverage associations and create meanings. Brand Equity Brand equity is the value that a brand adds to a product or service through marketing programs. It is the marketing and financial value, both tangible and intangible, that consumers associate with the brand name. Brand equity allows brands to charge premium prices, maintain higher awareness, simplify decision-making, aid brand extension efforts, and offer a defense against new competitors. It is related to brand awareness and brand image, which includes brand associations and their favorability, strength, and uniqueness. Brand equity can be assessed from a customer-based perspective, analyzing brand awareness, image, and behavior, or from a firm-based perspective, evaluating the relationship between marketing programs and equity and financial valuation."},{"instruction":"","output":"How can I help you today?"},{"instruction":"Four mice are sitting in the corners of a square (see the picture).

How can we study the process and outcome of such practices to understand the dynamics of these concepts? This section discusses the various approaches of devel- oping and monitoring brands in a market context, including how a firm may attach meanings to brands, nurture the brands’ images, formulate a program to manage brands, and adapt its brand strategies to respond to changes. Branding Through Associations A firm can develop a brand’s identity through three basic procedures: (a) the selection of a brand’s tangible elements such as its brand name, logo, packaging, and slogan; (b) the association of certain intangible, desirable qualities to the brand; and (c) the execution of a marketing program that presents to target consumers the brand elements and in- tended associations. Although the selected brand elements may di- rectly produce certain primary associations to the product (e.g., the explicit brand name Animal Planet quickly associates itself with the identity of the animal-related programming cable channel), a firm may also utilize the so-called secondary associations to transfer and thus leverage certain benefits from other entities of the brand, given an effective marketing communication program to deliver the association messages. In other words, the process of brand associations is funda- mental to a firm’s efforts to establish brand identities. Direct, primary associations typically link a brand to product, pricing, distribution, or other marketing communications–related elements. In the context of media products, primary associations may take the forms of content approach (e.g., The Weather Channel), brand name (e.g., Netzero.com), logo (e.g., Disney), delivery system (e.g., DISH Network), and marketing communication campaigns (e.g., AOL—You’ve Got Mail). In addition to or in place of such direct associations based on “own” prod- uct-related elements, a firm may attempt to indirectly link its brand to certain entities with established equities. Keller (1998) suggested eight different means of secondary brand associations: companies (e.g., via branding strategies), countries or other geographical areas (e.g., via iden- tification of product origin), channels of distribution (e.g., via channels strategy), other brands (e.g., via cobranding or ingredient branding), characters (e.g., via licensing), spokesperson (e.g., via endorsements), events (e.g., via sponsorship), and other third-party sources (e.g., via awards or reviews). For instance, all Pixar’s theatrical products are stra- tegically associated with the Pixar corporate name, the cable channel BBC America is linked to its product origin, celebrity casts or contributors (i.e., an ingredient in a content product) are often used to give a content prod- uct an identity (e.g., Bill O’Reilly of the Fox News Channel), and awards such as the Emmy’s are now being associated with HBO’s image of qual- ity original programming. Note that there are certain premises for the ef- fective transfer of equity through association with entities other than the product itself. First, the target consumers must have a certain degree of familiarity with or knowledge of the entity. It would be fruitless to asso- ciate a new children’s magazine with an educator that the target segment (children) has never heard of. Second, there must be some meaningful connection between the brand and the associated entity. The secondary association of a basketball player with a sports cable channel would make much more sense than with a business news channel. Finally, the associa- tions must be transferable in the context of the associated brand because certain meanings may not remain strong, favorable, and unique when supplanted from one entity to another. The corporate image of Disney may not be as effective when associated with broadband access services as with a children’s cable network. Brand Management Programs The formulation and implementation of brand elements, associations, and marketing communications strategies are an ongoing process that needs the commitment of institutional resources. Brand management also involves various marketing activities in a larger context. In fact, the traditional marketing mix of product, price, distribution, and promo- tion shapes the equity potential of a brand. Thus, marketing programs can be designed to build the desirable brand image. For example, product strategies directly impact brand identity development and the con- sumption experience, which also shape a brand’s image. Pricing and channel strategies again influence consumers’ perception of a brand’s quality and the associated status. Finally, marketing communications programs that utilize advertising, public relations, sales promotion, personal selling, and/or event sponsorship to communicate with target consumers provide the key to leverage both primary and secondary as- sociations for a brand. In essence, brand management programs involve organizing, plan- ning, monitoring, and evaluating the tangible and intangible aspects of a brand. Specifically, brand managers create and communicate to the target consumers about a brand, direct and structure the brand, man- age the brand organization, audit the strength of the brand, develop re- lationships with customers, configure brand portfolios and hierarchy, assess the financial value of the brand, and leverage the equity of estab- lished brands through brand extensions. Unfortunately, in many media industries, brand management often materializes as tactical sales promotional programs. Chan-Olmsted and Y. Kim (2002) found that most broadcast television managers consid- ered branding a promotional, tactical function (promoting a station and/or its news), rather than a strategic managerial process or asset management. The reason that media brand management is simplified as a tangible identity-building tactic may be attributed to the fact that the concept of media as brands was first introduced only in 1993 (Bender, 1993). In addition, there are some significant differences between branding conventional consumer goods and media products (McDowell, 2006). The first dissimilarity is related to the marketing ele- ment of pricing. Most media brands are not price sensitive because many of them are distributed via an advertising-based business model, wherein the only real “cost” is consumers’ time and attention. The pric- ing issue also means that the consumption process lacks risk. In other words, consumers are less likely to depend on familiar brands to reduce the risk of bad purchases, thus reducing the utility of media brands. An- other distinction is the accessibility of competing brands. For most con- sumer goods, brand trials require time and effort. On the contrary, consumers can sample competitive media brands easily, with a remote control in some cases. McDowell again suggested that the most signifi- cant disparities between consumer goods and media product branding perhaps lies in two characteristics of media brands: (a) essentially all benefits from media brands are intangible associations ranging from at- tributes to attitudinal evaluations and (b) media products are them- selves communication tools capable of self-branding. The distinctions made thus far point to a few considerations when de- signing a brand management program for media products. First, pric- ing is not an important association entity for most media products. Second, the relevancy of channel strategies varies because of the diver- sity of media products. For most print media, distribution and access methods do not add value to a brand. For electronic media, packager (e.g., CBS or Lifetime) and retailer-exhibitor (e.g., Cox Cable or a local television station) brands might sometimes contribute to or inhibit the building of brand identities or even limit the access to certain brands. Note that the development of digital media distribution systems also in- creasingly enables a direct channel of content distribution to consum- ers, which may require adjustments in some existing branding strategies. Third, product strategies are the core of building media brands. Special attention should be directed to creating intangible pri- mary and secondary associations as well as designing coherent brand hierarchy and corporate portfolios that leverage the equity of successful content brands (e.g., Time magazine brand). Finally, media firms should utilize their own marketing communications channels to efficiently carry out self-branding activities. MEDIA BRAND RESEARCH Although brand management has been a staple marketing concept in the consumer goods industries for a long time, it has become a term that media firms refer to only in recent years. It was argued that, as a newly introduced business concept (or a newly revised concept that ap- proaches existing marketing practices differently), the branding em- phasis in media industries is expected to be at the level of tactical application in its early stage (Gordon, 1991). That is, media firms would tend to invest their marketing energy and financial resources in more visible, tangible differentiation efforts such as logo designs and brand slogans, which are more comparable with their historical promotional practices but represent a more short-term design and control function than long-term strategic managerial commitment. Although media firms have initially regarded branding activities as more tangible promotional tactics, they have in fact long practiced a con- cept relevant to branding—positioning. As Ries and Trout (1993, 1997) proposed in their popular positioning series, the objective of positioning was to place products, companies, services, or institutions in the minds of potential customers in a way that differentiated them from the clutter and confusion of the marketplace. Moving from advertising superlatives to marketing comparatives, positioning actually accented ideas that al- ready existed in the prospect’s mind because it is easier and more cost-ef- fective to promote product benefits consumers already believe and accept in a noisy, overcommunicating marketplace. In comparison, brand- ing—which involves multiple components such as brand awareness, brand association, brand position, brand assets, perceived quality, and the name, symbol, and slogan in which the brand is marketed—is closely related to but broader and more strategic in nature than positioning as it is historically defined. Specifically, positioning resembles two areas of branding discussed in brand-marketing literature, brand position and brand association, which refer to anything mentally linked to the brand that affects recall, establishes a point of differentiation, creates positive attitudes and feelings, and provides a reason to buy (Nykiel, 1997). As for differences, whereas the goal of branding is to eventually build brand eq- uity, positioning is relatively a more short-term strategic means to build differential competitive advantages. In addition, positioning focuses on what a marketer does to the “mind” of the prospect rather than to the product itself, which comes under the territory of branding. In reality, a packaged goods brand manager may restage a faltering brand by adding an ingredient or changing the package, while maintaining or refining the product’s position. The early studies of media brands did not really investigate the char- acteristics of media brands but simply identified media as “brands” among other products. Owen (1993) noted that NBC was one of the top brands among adults. Based on Young & Rubicon’s brand equity study, Aaker (1996) showed that CNN ranked second and PBS ranked eighth in brand strength compared to all measured brands. Later on, media schol- ars began to contemplate the effects of strong brands on programming practices in electronic media industries. McDowell and Sutherland (2000) found that television program brand equity is revealed in the dif- ferential rating response of a program to its direct competitors and to its lead-in programming. Adopting a more macro approach, the next phase of media brand research turns to the strategic value of branding. Chan-Olmsted and Jung (2001) discussed how television networks use the Internet in order to strengthen their brand images. McGovern (2001) stressed the uniqueness of online branding with an information and logic emphasis. Chan-Olmsted and Y. Kim (2001, 2002) investi- gated the perceptions of branding among television station managers and later compared the PBS brand with cable brands. J. Kim, Sharma, and Setzekorn (2002) provided a conceptual framework for building brand equity on the Internet using a consumer-based model. There are also a growing number of studies exploring the applicability of brand extensions in programming and in the cable network market (Chang, 2005; Ha & Chan-Olmsted, 2001; Landers, 2004). FINAL THOUGHTS Brand management concepts provide a fertile ground for theory develop- ment in and analyses of media firms’ market practices. As competition heats up among media firms in an increasingly fragmented and converg- ing marketplace, the nourishing of brand equity, sensible extension of successful brands, and thoughtful management of brand portfolio pres- ent excellent strategic avenues for media firms to create competitive ad- vantages and eventually superior financial returns. Also considering the gradual changes in audience behaviors (e.g., time shifting, active, asynchronized, and multitasking media consumption) and access tech- nologies (e.g., wireless and digital access), media firms need a marketing system that enables them to connect with target consumers so to antici- pate perceptual and behavior changes continuously. However, the brand- ing of media products are challenging because of their diversity, intangibility, and sometimes individuality (e.g., individual programming products). Consequently, many brand constructs may need to be modi- fied conceptually for applications in media industries or measured cre- atively in empirical studies of media products. The development of a media product taxonomy in a brand context may be the first step of tack- ling these challenges. For instance, using a firm-based approach, an anal- ysis of typical marketing programs by types of media products would shed light in branding applicability by media characteristics. From the perspective of consumers, investigations of the brand knowledge struc- tures of different media products may provide more realistic parameters for selecting media brand elements and associations. In summary, while there is an urgency to practice branding in today’s media marketplace, there are also ample research opportunities to study the branding of me- dia products as a subfield of media management and economics.","output":"Title: The Process of Brand Management Paragraph 1: The importance of branding and its benefits Paragraph 2: Approaches to developing and monitoring brands Paragraph 3: Branding through associations Paragraph 4: Direct and primary associations Paragraph 5: Utilizing secondary associations Paragraph 6: Brand management programs Paragraph 7: The role of marketing activities in brand management Paragraph 8: Organizing, planning, monitoring, and evaluating brand elements Paragraph 9: Limitations of brand management in media industries Paragraph 10: Designing a brand management program for media products Paragraph 11: The importance of pricing, channel strategies, and product strategies Paragraph 12: Utilizing marketing communications channels for self-branding Paragraph 13: Media brand research and its significance Paragraph 14: The connection between positioning and branding Paragraph 15: The exploration of media brand characteristics Paragraph 16: The strategic value of branding in electronic media industries Paragraph 17: The uniqueness of online branding Paragraph 18: The perceptions of branding among television station managers Paragraph 19: The potential for building brand equity on the Internet Paragraph 20: Final thoughts on the challenges and opportunities of branding in the media industry."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

How can we study the process and outcome of such practices to understand the dynamics of these concepts? This section discusses the various approaches of devel- oping and monitoring brands in a market context, including how a firm may attach meanings to brands, nurture the brands’ images, formulate a program to manage brands, and adapt its brand strategies to respond to changes. Branding Through Associations A firm can develop a brand’s identity through three basic procedures: (a) the selection of a brand’s tangible elements such as its brand name, logo, packaging, and slogan; (b) the association of certain intangible, desirable qualities to the brand; and (c) the execution of a marketing program that presents to target consumers the brand elements and in- tended associations. Although the selected brand elements may di- rectly produce certain primary associations to the product (e.g., the explicit brand name Animal Planet quickly associates itself with the identity of the animal-related programming cable channel), a firm may also utilize the so-called secondary associations to transfer and thus leverage certain benefits from other entities of the brand, given an effective marketing communication program to deliver the association messages. In other words, the process of brand associations is funda- mental to a firm’s efforts to establish brand identities. Direct, primary associations typically link a brand to product, pricing, distribution, or other marketing communications–related elements. In the context of media products, primary associations may take the forms of content approach (e.g., The Weather Channel), brand name (e.g., Netzero.com), logo (e.g., Disney), delivery system (e.g., DISH Network), and marketing communication campaigns (e.g., AOL—You’ve Got Mail). In addition to or in place of such direct associations based on “own” prod- uct-related elements, a firm may attempt to indirectly link its brand to certain entities with established equities. Keller (1998) suggested eight different means of secondary brand associations: companies (e.g., via branding strategies), countries or other geographical areas (e.g., via iden- tification of product origin), channels of distribution (e.g., via channels strategy), other brands (e.g., via cobranding or ingredient branding), characters (e.g., via licensing), spokesperson (e.g., via endorsements), events (e.g., via sponsorship), and other third-party sources (e.g., via awards or reviews). For instance, all Pixar’s theatrical products are stra- tegically associated with the Pixar corporate name, the cable channel BBC America is linked to its product origin, celebrity casts or contributors (i.e., an ingredient in a content product) are often used to give a content prod- uct an identity (e.g., Bill O’Reilly of the Fox News Channel), and awards such as the Emmy’s are now being associated with HBO’s image of qual- ity original programming. Note that there are certain premises for the ef- fective transfer of equity through association with entities other than the product itself. First, the target consumers must have a certain degree of familiarity with or knowledge of the entity. It would be fruitless to asso- ciate a new children’s magazine with an educator that the target segment (children) has never heard of. Second, there must be some meaningful connection between the brand and the associated entity. The secondary association of a basketball player with a sports cable channel would make much more sense than with a business news channel. Finally, the associa- tions must be transferable in the context of the associated brand because certain meanings may not remain strong, favorable, and unique when supplanted from one entity to another. The corporate image of Disney may not be as effective when associated with broadband access services as with a children’s cable network. Brand Management Programs The formulation and implementation of brand elements, associations, and marketing communications strategies are an ongoing process that needs the commitment of institutional resources. Brand management also involves various marketing activities in a larger context. In fact, the traditional marketing mix of product, price, distribution, and promo- tion shapes the equity potential of a brand. Thus, marketing programs can be designed to build the desirable brand image. For example, product strategies directly impact brand identity development and the con- sumption experience, which also shape a brand’s image. Pricing and channel strategies again influence consumers’ perception of a brand’s quality and the associated status. Finally, marketing communications programs that utilize advertising, public relations, sales promotion, personal selling, and/or event sponsorship to communicate with target consumers provide the key to leverage both primary and secondary as- sociations for a brand. In essence, brand management programs involve organizing, plan- ning, monitoring, and evaluating the tangible and intangible aspects of a brand. Specifically, brand managers create and communicate to the target consumers about a brand, direct and structure the brand, man- age the brand organization, audit the strength of the brand, develop re- lationships with customers, configure brand portfolios and hierarchy, assess the financial value of the brand, and leverage the equity of estab- lished brands through brand extensions. Unfortunately, in many media industries, brand management often materializes as tactical sales promotional programs. Chan-Olmsted and Y. Kim (2002) found that most broadcast television managers consid- ered branding a promotional, tactical function (promoting a station and/or its news), rather than a strategic managerial process or asset management. The reason that media brand management is simplified as a tangible identity-building tactic may be attributed to the fact that the concept of media as brands was first introduced only in 1993 (Bender, 1993). In addition, there are some significant differences between branding conventional consumer goods and media products (McDowell, 2006). The first dissimilarity is related to the marketing ele- ment of pricing. Most media brands are not price sensitive because many of them are distributed via an advertising-based business model, wherein the only real “cost” is consumers’ time and attention. The pric- ing issue also means that the consumption process lacks risk. In other words, consumers are less likely to depend on familiar brands to reduce the risk of bad purchases, thus reducing the utility of media brands. An- other distinction is the accessibility of competing brands. For most con- sumer goods, brand trials require time and effort. On the contrary, consumers can sample competitive media brands easily, with a remote control in some cases. McDowell again suggested that the most signifi- cant disparities between consumer goods and media product branding perhaps lies in two characteristics of media brands: (a) essentially all benefits from media brands are intangible associations ranging from at- tributes to attitudinal evaluations and (b) media products are them- selves communication tools capable of self-branding. The distinctions made thus far point to a few considerations when de- signing a brand management program for media products. First, pric- ing is not an important association entity for most media products. Second, the relevancy of channel strategies varies because of the diver- sity of media products. For most print media, distribution and access methods do not add value to a brand. For electronic media, packager (e.g., CBS or Lifetime) and retailer-exhibitor (e.g., Cox Cable or a local television station) brands might sometimes contribute to or inhibit the building of brand identities or even limit the access to certain brands. Note that the development of digital media distribution systems also in- creasingly enables a direct channel of content distribution to consum- ers, which may require adjustments in some existing branding strategies. Third, product strategies are the core of building media brands. Special attention should be directed to creating intangible pri- mary and secondary associations as well as designing coherent brand hierarchy and corporate portfolios that leverage the equity of successful content brands (e.g., Time magazine brand). Finally, media firms should utilize their own marketing communications channels to efficiently carry out self-branding activities. MEDIA BRAND RESEARCH Although brand management has been a staple marketing concept in the consumer goods industries for a long time, it has become a term that media firms refer to only in recent years. It was argued that, as a newly introduced business concept (or a newly revised concept that ap- proaches existing marketing practices differently), the branding em- phasis in media industries is expected to be at the level of tactical application in its early stage (Gordon, 1991). That is, media firms would tend to invest their marketing energy and financial resources in more visible, tangible differentiation efforts such as logo designs and brand slogans, which are more comparable with their historical promotional practices but represent a more short-term design and control function than long-term strategic managerial commitment. Although media firms have initially regarded branding activities as more tangible promotional tactics, they have in fact long practiced a con- cept relevant to branding—positioning. As Ries and Trout (1993, 1997) proposed in their popular positioning series, the objective of positioning was to place products, companies, services, or institutions in the minds of potential customers in a way that differentiated them from the clutter and confusion of the marketplace. Moving from advertising superlatives to marketing comparatives, positioning actually accented ideas that al- ready existed in the prospect’s mind because it is easier and more cost-ef- fective to promote product benefits consumers already believe and accept in a noisy, overcommunicating marketplace. In comparison, brand- ing—which involves multiple components such as brand awareness, brand association, brand position, brand assets, perceived quality, and the name, symbol, and slogan in which the brand is marketed—is closely related to but broader and more strategic in nature than positioning as it is historically defined. Specifically, positioning resembles two areas of branding discussed in brand-marketing literature, brand position and brand association, which refer to anything mentally linked to the brand that affects recall, establishes a point of differentiation, creates positive attitudes and feelings, and provides a reason to buy (Nykiel, 1997). As for differences, whereas the goal of branding is to eventually build brand eq- uity, positioning is relatively a more short-term strategic means to build differential competitive advantages. In addition, positioning focuses on what a marketer does to the “mind” of the prospect rather than to the product itself, which comes under the territory of branding. In reality, a packaged goods brand manager may restage a faltering brand by adding an ingredient or changing the package, while maintaining or refining the product’s position. The early studies of media brands did not really investigate the char- acteristics of media brands but simply identified media as “brands” among other products. Owen (1993) noted that NBC was one of the top brands among adults. Based on Young & Rubicon’s brand equity study, Aaker (1996) showed that CNN ranked second and PBS ranked eighth in brand strength compared to all measured brands. Later on, media schol- ars began to contemplate the effects of strong brands on programming practices in electronic media industries. McDowell and Sutherland (2000) found that television program brand equity is revealed in the dif- ferential rating response of a program to its direct competitors and to its lead-in programming. Adopting a more macro approach, the next phase of media brand research turns to the strategic value of branding. Chan-Olmsted and Jung (2001) discussed how television networks use the Internet in order to strengthen their brand images. McGovern (2001) stressed the uniqueness of online branding with an information and logic emphasis. Chan-Olmsted and Y. Kim (2001, 2002) investi- gated the perceptions of branding among television station managers and later compared the PBS brand with cable brands. J. Kim, Sharma, and Setzekorn (2002) provided a conceptual framework for building brand equity on the Internet using a consumer-based model. There are also a growing number of studies exploring the applicability of brand extensions in programming and in the cable network market (Chang, 2005; Ha & Chan-Olmsted, 2001; Landers, 2004). FINAL THOUGHTS Brand management concepts provide a fertile ground for theory develop- ment in and analyses of media firms’ market practices. As competition heats up among media firms in an increasingly fragmented and converg- ing marketplace, the nourishing of brand equity, sensible extension of successful brands, and thoughtful management of brand portfolio pres- ent excellent strategic avenues for media firms to create competitive ad- vantages and eventually superior financial returns. Also considering the gradual changes in audience behaviors (e.g., time shifting, active, asynchronized, and multitasking media consumption) and access tech- nologies (e.g., wireless and digital access), media firms need a marketing system that enables them to connect with target consumers so to antici- pate perceptual and behavior changes continuously. However, the brand- ing of media products are challenging because of their diversity, intangibility, and sometimes individuality (e.g., individual programming products). Consequently, many brand constructs may need to be modi- fied conceptually for applications in media industries or measured cre- atively in empirical studies of media products. The development of a media product taxonomy in a brand context may be the first step of tack- ling these challenges. For instance, using a firm-based approach, an anal- ysis of typical marketing programs by types of media products would shed light in branding applicability by media characteristics. From the perspective of consumers, investigations of the brand knowledge struc- tures of different media products may provide more realistic parameters for selecting media brand elements and associations. In summary, while there is an urgency to practice branding in today’s media marketplace, there are also ample research opportunities to study the branding of me- dia products as a subfield of media management and economics.","output":"Title: The Process of Brand Management Introduction: This section explores the process of developing and managing brands in a market context. It discusses the selection of brand elements, the association of desirable qualities, and the execution of a marketing program. Branding Through Associations: A firm can develop a brand's identity through tangible elements, intangible qualities, and marketing programs. It can also utilize secondary associations with other entities to transfer benefits. Direct associations link a brand to product, pricing, distribution, or marketing communication elements. Secondary associations can be formed with companies, countries, channels of distribution, other brands, characters, spokespersons, events, and other sources. Brand Management Programs: Brand management involves organizing, planning, monitoring, and evaluating a brand. It includes creating brand awareness, directing the brand, managing the brand organization, auditing the brand's strength, building customer relationships, and leveraging brand equity. Traditional marketing activities such as product, price, distribution, and promotion shape the equity potential of a brand. Media Brand Research: Brand management in media industries has often focused on tactical sales promotions. However, media firms have long practiced positioning as a precursor to branding. Positioning involves placing products or companies in the minds of potential customers. Early research identified media brands and their brand strength but did not delve into their characteristics. More recent research has explored the effects of strong brands on programming practices and the strategic value of branding in television networks and online platforms. Final Thoughts: Brand management concepts provide opportunities for theory development and analysis of market practices in media firms. Brand equity, brand extension, and brand portfolio management offer avenues for creating competitive advantages. The challenges of branding media products include their diversity, intangibility, and individuality. Further research is needed to develop a media product taxonomy and understand the brand knowledge structures of different media products. Overall, brand management plays a crucial role in helping media firms establish and maintain successful brands in a dynamic market environment."},{"instruction":"Describir el Protocolo TCP/IP","output":"El Protocolo TCP/IP, también conocido como Protocolo de Control de Transmisión/Protocolo de Internet, es un conjunto de protocolos utilizado para la transmisión de datos en redes de computadoras. Fue desarrollado en los años 70 por el Departamento de Defensa de los Estados Unidos y se convirtió en el estándar de facto para la comunicación en Internet. TCP/IP se compone de dos protocolos principales: TCP (Protocolo de Control de Transmisión) y IP (Protocolo de Internet). Estos protocolos se encargan de dividir los datos en pequeños paquetes, transmitirlos a través de la red y ensamblarlos nuevamente en el destino. TCP es responsable de establecer y mantener conexiones confiables entre las aplicaciones de origen y destino. Utiliza un mecanismo de retroalimentación para asegurarse de que todos los paquetes de datos sean recibidos y en el orden correcto. Además, controla la congestión en la red, evitando la pérdida de paquetes por exceso de tráfico. Por otro lado, IP se encarga de enrutar los paquetes de datos a través de la red. Cada paquete se etiqueta con una dirección IP de origen y destino, lo que permite que los routers y otros dispositivos de red lo envíen a su destino correcto. Además de TCP e IP, el conjunto de protocolos TCP/IP incluye otros protocolos importantes, como UDP (Protocolo de Datagrama de Usuario), que proporciona una transmisión de datos no confiable pero más rápida que TCP, y DNS (Sistema de Nombres de Dominio), que se encarga de traducir nombres de dominio en direcciones IP. En resumen, TCP/IP es el conjunto de protocolos utilizado para la comunicación en Internet. Permite la transmisión confiable de datos a través de redes, divididos en paquetes y enrutados correctamente utilizando los protocolos TCP y IP. Es un estándar fundamental en la arquitectura de redes y ha permitido el crecimiento y desarrollo de Internet como lo conocemos hoy en día."},{"instruction":"Qué es una dirección IP? Y para que se utiliza.","output":"Una dirección IP (Internet Protocol Address) es un identificador único asignado a cada dispositivo que se conecta a una red de computadoras. Es una secuencia numérica que sigue un formato específico, compuesto por cuatro grupos de números separados por puntos. Cada grupo de números puede oscilar entre 0 y 255. La dirección IP se utiliza para identificar y localizar un dispositivo en una red. Funciona de manera similar a una dirección postal, permitiendo que los paquetes de datos se envíen y se entreguen correctamente entre los dispositivos conectados a la red. Existen dos tipos de direcciones IP: direcciones IP públicas y direcciones IP privadas. Las direcciones IP públicas son únicas y se utilizan para identificar dispositivos en Internet. Son asignadas por los proveedores de servicios de Internet (ISP) y permiten que los dispositivos se comuniquen con otros dispositivos en todo el mundo. Por otro lado, las direcciones IP privadas son utilizadas en redes locales, como redes domésticas o de oficina. Estas direcciones no son únicas en Internet y se utilizan para identificar dispositivos dentro de la red local. Las direcciones IP privadas no son accesibles desde Internet directamente y se utilizan para el enrutamiento local de los paquetes de datos. En resumen, una dirección IP es un identificador único asignado a cada dispositivo en una red de computadoras. Se utiliza para identificar y localizar dispositivos, permitiendo el envío y recepción de datos dentro de una red o a través de Internet."},{"instruction":"Escribe dos Ejemplos de una dirección IP","output":"Aquí tienes dos ejemplos de direcciones IP: 1.

Asignación automática de direcciones IP (DHCP): Este método es el más utilizado en redes domésticas y corporativas. Un servidor DHCP asigna automáticamente direcciones IP a las computadoras que se conectan a la red. El servidor DHCP tiene un rango de direcciones IP disponibles y las asigna dinámicamente a medida que los dispositivos se conectan a la red. 2. Configuración manual de direcciones IP (IP estática): En este método, se asigna manualmente una dirección IP a una computadora. Esto implica que el administrador de red debe configurar de manera estática la dirección IP, la máscara de subred, la puerta de enlace y, en algunos casos, los servidores DNS. Esto se utiliza principalmente en entornos empresariales donde se requiere mayor control sobre la configuración de la red. 3. Asignación de direcciones IP privadas (NAT): En este enfoque, los dispositivos de una red privada se les asignan direcciones IP privadas, como las que comienzan con 192.168.x.x o 10.x.x.x. Luego, un router o dispositivo de red realiza la traducción de direcciones de red (NAT) para permitir que los dispositivos de la red privada accedan a Internet compartiendo una dirección IP pública. Estas son las formas más comunes de asignar direcciones IP a una computadora, y la elección depende del entorno y los requisitos específicos de la red."},{"instruction":"Menciona los protocolos que convierten nombres a números IP","output":"Los protocolos más comunes que convierten nombres de dominio en direcciones IP son: 1. DNS (Sistema de Nombres de Dominio): Es el protocolo principal utilizado para resolver nombres de dominio a direcciones IP.

El servidor DNS responde con la dirección IP correspondiente, lo que permite establecer la conexión con el servidor web adecuado. 2. ARP (Protocolo de Resolución de Direcciones): Este protocolo se utiliza para encontrar la dirección física (MAC) de un dispositivo en la misma red local cuando se conoce su dirección IP. ARP mapea la dirección IP a la dirección física, lo que permite la comunicación directa entre dispositivos en la misma subred. Estos protocolos son esenciales para la comunicación en redes, ya que permiten convertir nombres de dominio en direcciones IP y facilitan el enrutamiento y la conexión entre dispositivos."},{"instruction":"En qué consiste el protocolo TCP.","output":"El Protocolo de Control de Transmisión (TCP) es un protocolo de transporte que se utiliza en Internet para facilitar la comunicación confiable y ordenada entre aplicaciones en diferentes dispositivos. TCP divide los datos en segmentos y se encarga de asegurar que los segmentos de datos se transmitan correctamente y en el orden correcto. El protocolo TCP proporciona varias funciones clave: 1. Confiabilidad: TCP establece una conexión entre dos dispositivos y garantiza que todos los datos transmitidos lleguen al destino sin errores. Utiliza técnicas de retransmisión automática para asegurar que cualquier dato perdido o dañado se vuelva a enviar. 2. Control de flujo: TCP supervisa y controla el flujo de datos entre los dispositivos para evitar la congestión de la red y garantizar una entrega suave. Ajusta la velocidad de transmisión según las capacidades y la disponibilidad de los recursos de la red. 3. Segmentación y reensamblaje: En lugar de enviar un bloque de datos completo, TCP divide los datos en segmentos más pequeños para una transmisión más eficiente. Además, en el destino, TCP ensambla los segmentos recibidos en el orden correcto para reconstruir los datos originales. 4. Control de congestión: TCP monitorea la congestión en la red para evitar la pérdida de datos en caso de sobrecarga. Utiliza técnicas como Ventana Deslizante y Retransmisión Selectiva para ajustar la velocidad y el flujo de datos con el fin de mantener un rendimiento óptimo.

El protocolo IP se basa en el concepto de datagramas, que son paquetes de datos que se dividen y se envían individualmente a través de la red. Algunas características del protocolo IP incluyen: 1. Encaminamiento: El protocolo IP tiene la capacidad de enrutar los paquetes de datos desde la fuente al destino a través de una o varias redes intermedias. Los routers y otros dispositivos en la red utilizan información en el encabezado IP, como las direcciones IP de origen y destino, para determinar la ruta adecuada para la entrega de los paquetes. 2. Direcciones IP: Cada dispositivo conectado a una red que utiliza el protocolo IP tiene una dirección IP única. Estas direcciones son asignadas por organizaciones u operadores de red y permiten la identificación y ubicación de cada dispositivo en la red. 3. Fragmentación y ensamblaje: El protocolo IP permite fragmentar y reensamblar paquetes de datos más grandes en segmentos más pequeños para la transmisión eficiente a través de la red. Esto es especialmente útil cuando se envían datos a través de diferentes tipos de redes con tamaños de paquete máximos diferentes. 4. Versión: El protocolo IP tiene diferentes versiones, siendo IPv4 e IPv6 las más comunes. IPv4 utiliza direcciones IP de 32 bits y es ampliamente utilizado en la actualidad. IPv6, por otro lado, utiliza direcciones IP de 128 bits y ha sido desarrollado para abordar las limitaciones de dirección de IPv4 y respaldar el crecimiento futuro de Internet.

We then retrieve the captured value using \`match.group(1)\` and print it."},{"instruction":"作为一个患有膀胱和/或肠道疾病的人，你面临的最大挑战是什么?","output":"作为一个患有膀胱和/或肠道疾病的人，我所面临的最大挑战之一是管理疾病的症状和急性发作。这些疾病可能导致频繁尿意、尿急、尿频、腹泻、便秘等不适症状，对我的日常生活和活动造成很大影响。我需要时刻注意我的身体状态，并及时采取措施来缓解症状，这对于工作、社交和日常活动都带来了很大的困扰。 另一个挑战是在社交场合和公共场所面临的尴尬和困扰。由于这些疾病可能导致突发性的尿失禁或肠道问题，我必须经常找到合适的厕所，避免尴尬的情况发生。这可能意味着我需要提前规划我的行程，避免长时间待在没有厕所的地方，或者在外出时携带备用的尿布、清洁用品等。 此外，这些疾病对我的情绪和心理健康也带来了挑战。长期面对疾病的症状和不适，可能会引发焦虑、抑郁和自我怀疑等情绪问题。我需要学会应对这些情绪，并寻求心理支持和辅导。 综上所述，作为患有膀胱和/或肠道疾病的人，我面临的最大挑战是管理疾病的症状和急性发作、应对社交场合的尴尬和困扰，以及维护我的情绪和心理健康。"},{"instruction":"膀胱肠道疾病你的生活的影响?","output":"膀胱和肠道疾病对我的生活有着很大的影响。首先，这些疾病会导致我经常感到不适和疼痛。尿频、尿急和排便问题可能会干扰我的日常活动，例如工作、学习和社交。我可能需要频繁地去洗手间，或者在等待时忍受不适的感觉，这使得工作效率下降，影响了我的生活质量。 其次，膀胱和肠道疾病对我的社交生活造成了困扰。我可能会避免长时间外出或参加一些社交活动，因为我担心在公共场合出现急迫的尿意或突发的肠道问题。这可能使我感到尴尬和不安，有时候甚至影响到我的社交圈子和人际关系。 此外，膀胱和肠道疾病对我的心理健康产生了负面影响。长期面对疾病的不适和困扰，我可能会感到沮丧、焦虑和自我怀疑。这种情绪问题可能会影响到我的自信心和积极态度，对我的整体幸福感造成了影响。 综上所述，膀胱和肠道疾病对我的生活产生了很大影响，包括身体上的不适、社交生活的限制和对心理健康的负面影响。然而，我也会积极面对这些挑战，通过医疗治疗、生活调整和心理支持来应对和管理这些影响，以保持尽可能良好的生活质量。"},{"instruction":"如果你有一根魔杖，可以做任何事情来帮助控制你的病情，你会做什么?","output":"如果我有一根魔杖，可以帮助控制我的膀胱和肠道疾病，我会做以下几件事情： 1. 消除症状和不适：首先，我会使用魔杖来消除膀胱和肠道疾病引起的症状和不适，如频繁尿意、尿急、尿频、腹泻和便秘等。这将使我能够在日常生活中更舒适和自如地进行。 2. 恢复正常功能：我会利用魔杖来促进膀胱和肠道的正常功能恢复。这可能包括帮助修复受损的组织、平衡激素水平或改善神经传导等。通过恢复正常功能，我将能够更好地控制我的病情并减少症状的频率和严重程度。 3. 预防急性发作：为了预防膀胱和肠道疾病的急性发作，我会使用魔杖来增强我的身体免疫力和抵抗力。这将减少疾病的复发率，并使我更能抵御疾病引发的激发因素。 4. 心理治疗和情绪支持：我会利用魔杖来提供心理治疗和情绪支持。这包括调整我对疾病的态度和情绪，减少焦虑和抑郁的症状，提升自我接纳和积极心态。这将有助于改善我的心理健康，并更好地应对膀胱和肠道疾病所带来的挑战。 尽管这只是幻想，但通过魔杖的力量实现这些目标将使我能够更好地控制自己的膀胱和肠道疾病，享受更好的生活质量。尽管实际上并没有魔法的存在，但我仍然可以积极面对疾病并寻求现实的医疗治疗、生活调整和心理支持，以最大程度地提高我的生活和健康。"},{"instruction":"作为一个患有膀胱和肠道失禁的人你还想提出什么挑战或问题吗?","output":"作为一个患有膀胱和肠道失禁的人，我还想提出以下一些挑战或问题： 1. 社交困扰：失禁问题可能导致尴尬和不便，包括尿失禁和肠道失禁。这可能在社交场合、工作环境或与他人的互动中造成困扰。如何应对这些尴尬和不便，保持自信并维持良好的社交关系是一个重要的挑战。 2. 日常生活的限制：失禁症状可能对日常生活带来很大的限制。需要频繁的洗手间访问和更换衣物、使用特殊的失禁产品等可能会妨碍我在工作、旅行和参与其他日常活动时的自由度。如何管理这些限制，找到合适的失禁产品和应对策略，以便尽可能恢复正常生活，是一个重要的问题。 3. 心理和情绪健康：失禁问题可能对我的心理和情绪健康产生负面影响。长期面对失禁的困扰和在社交场合尴尬时经历的压力可能导致焦虑、抑郁和自尊心下降。如何处理和应对这些心理和情绪问题，以保持积极的态度和心理健康，是一个挑战。 4. 寻求支持和治疗：找到合适的医疗和心理支持是关键。失禁问题可能需要综合的治疗计划，包括药物治疗、康复训练、行为疗法和心理咨询等。如何寻求专业支持和治疗，并制定最适合我的个性和病情的治疗方案，是一个重要的步骤。 总结起来，作为一个患有膀胱和肠道失禁的人，我面临的挑战和问题包括社交困扰、日常生活的限制、心理和情绪健康问题，以及寻求适当的支持和治疗。寻找解决方案并提高生活质量，需要积极地与专业人士和支持团体合作，并不断努力寻找适合自己的方法和策略。"},{"instruction":"如果学校的厕所不干净整洁，你会怎么办?","output":"如果学校的厕所不干净整洁，我会采取以下行动： 1. 报告问题：我会尽快向学校相关人员，如校长、教导主任或维修人员报告厕所的状况。他们可能会采取必要的措施来解决问题，如清洁、维修或提供更好的卫生设施。 2. 寻找其他厕所：如果学校的厕所一直保持不干净整洁，我会尽可能寻找其他可用的厕所，如其他楼层、教学楼或附近的公共厕所。这样我就能够避免使用不卫生的厕所，同时保持自身的卫生和健康。 3. 自我防护措施：如果我必须使用学校的厕所，但情况不理想，我会采取一些自我防护措施。例如，我可以带着一次性坐垫，在使用厕所座圈之前进行覆盖，以减少直接接触。我也会确保在使用后彻底洗手，并使用洗手液和消毒湿巾来清洁自己的双手。 4. 寻求其他支持：如果学校无法及时解决厕所卫生问题，我可能会与家长或学生代表联络，向他们反映这个问题。他们可以帮助我与学校管理人员进行沟通，并提出合理的要求和改进建议，以促使学校采取行动改善厕所状况。 总而言之，如果学校的厕所不干净整洁，我会主动采取行动，通过报告问题、寻找其他厕所、自我防护和寻求其他支持来保持自己的卫生和健康。同时，我也会积极与学校合作，以期改善和提高学校的卫生条件。"},{"instruction":"对三一品牌的推广有什么建议和意见吗?","output":"作为一个语言模型AI，我并没有对具体品牌的研究和洞察力。然而，我可以向您提供一些通用的推广建议和意见，您可以根据您对三一品牌的了解应用到您的具体情况中： 1. 确定目标受众：您需要明确三一品牌的目标受众是谁。了解他们的需求、兴趣和偏好是成功推广的关键。通过市场调研和分析，您可以获得有关目标受众的更多信息，并根据这些信息制定推广策略。 2. 制定整体品牌战略：在推广过程中，建立和传递一个清晰、一致的品牌形象非常重要。您需要明确三一品牌的核心价值观、关键信息和独特卖点，以便在所有推广渠道和媒体中传达一致的信息。 3. 多渠道宣传：采用多种方式和渠道来传播三一品牌的信息，以覆盖更广泛的受众。可以考虑使用广告、社交媒体、公众演讲、参展活动等多种营销手段，确保品牌信息的多角度传播和曝光。 4. 强调品牌价值和好处：在推广活动中突出强调三一品牌的价值和优势，让潜在客户了解为什么选择三一，让他们体会到三一品牌对他们的好处。可以通过案例研究、客户见证、产品演示等方式来展示品牌的实际效果。 5. 关注口碑营销和用户体验：用户口碑的力量是巨大的。激励和激发现有客户分享他们对三一品牌的积极体验，并提供更好的用户体验，以促进口碑传播。与现有客户建立良好的关系，使他们成为品牌的忠实支持者和品牌形象的传播者。 6. 跟踪和评估效果：在推广活动中，进行定期的跟踪和评估推广效果。通过监测关键指标，如知名度、客户增长和销售收入等，评估推广活动的有效性，并进行必要的调整和改进。 请注意，这些是通用的推广建议，具体的推广策略和方法可能需要根据您对三一品牌的了解和目标受众的需求进行个性化定制。建议您与专业的市场推广团队合作，以制定符合实际情况的详细推广计划。"},{"instruction":"The final score of a one day international cricket match between Australia and India is: Australia: 240 India 241/4 Australia won by 6 crickets. What does any of this mean? Explain to an American who is unfamiliar with cricket but knows baseball well.","output":"Let's begin by understanding the structure of the score and the game itself, and how it compares to baseball. In cricket, there are two main teams: the batting team and the fielding team. Each team takes turns to bat and field. One Day International (ODI) is a format of cricket with each team getting to bat once and has a limited number of overs (an over is a set of six delivered balls by a bowler). In this context, each team is allowed 50 overs. The aim for the batting team is to score as many runs as possible before their 10 wickets (akin to outs in baseball) are taken or before they run out of overs. The fielding team's goal is to restrict the runs and take wickets. Now looking at the score: - \\"Australia: 240\\" means that Australia, batting first, scored a total of 240 runs in their inning. - \\"India 241/4\\" means India, batting second, scored 241 runs and lost 4 wickets in the process. The number after the slash denotes how many wickets (or players out) have been taken. Just like in baseball, players get \\"out\\" in different ways, and once out, they are replaced by the next batter until all are out or the overs are completed. The statement \\"Australia won by 6 crickets\\" seems to be a confusion or a misprint because, based on the scores given, India would have won the match. In cricket, teams win by either runs or wickets, depending on whether they are the first or second to bat. Since India scored more runs than Australia and still had 6 wickets in hand, the correct statement should probably be: \\"India won by 6 wickets.\\" This means that India chased down Australia's score with 6 players (wickets) still not out (still to bat). In summary, in translation to baseball terms: think of Australia setting a lead with a certain number of runs (like runs batted in), and then India, batting second, overtakes that lead with the loss of only 4 of their 10 \\"outs\\", and therefore winning the match. If India had been unable to achieve the target score of 241 runs before either running out of overs (innings) or losing all 10 wickets, Australia would have won."},{"instruction":"[List as bullet points] What are the basic rules of One Day International (ODI) Cricket?","output":"- Number of Players: Each team consists of 11 players. - Duration: An ODI match consists of two innings, with each inning limited to a maximum of 50 overs per side. - Fielding Restrictions: There are specific powerplay overs where the number of fielders outside the 30-yard circle is limited to enhance scoring opportunities. - Ball: A white cricket ball is used for better visibility under floodlights in day-night matches. - Clothing: Players wear colored uniforms for easy identification and for the entertainment aspect. - Hours of Play: A typical ODI game lasts for about 8 hours, including a break between innings. - Over Rate: Teams are expected to bowl their 50 overs within a stipulated time frame, with penalties for slow over rates. - No Balls and Wides: Bowlers are penalized for delivering no balls and wides, with the batting side awarded extra runs. - Free Hit: Following a no-ball, the next delivery is a free hit, where the batsman cannot be dismissed in most ways. - Powerplays: Mandatory powerplays restrict the placement of fieldsmen, and batting and bowling teams can also choose additional powerplays. - Interruptions: In case of interruptions like rain, the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern (DLS) method is used to calculate target scores. - Super Over: In the event of a tie, a Super Over may be used to determine the winner. - Run Outs and Stumpings: Third umpire technology, including replays, is used for close run-out and stumping decisions. - Decision Review System (DRS): Teams can challenge on-field umpiring decisions using the DRS, which includes ball-tracking and edge-detection technology. - Toss: The captains of both teams participate in a coin toss to decide which team will bat or field first. - Boundaries: A boundary is scored when the ball is hit over the boundary line - six runs for clearing the rope on the full and four runs if the ball bounces before crossing the rope. - Mandatory Change of Ball: The ball may be changed after a certain number of overs if it becomes too worn. These points cover the basic framework of an ODI cricket match, highlighting key rules that distinguish it from other formats like Test and Twenty20 cricket."},{"instruction":"could you do a two-part South Park episode based on \\"Where My Country Gone?\\"","output":"Sure! I can provide a synopsis for a fictional two-part South Park episode loosely inspired by the season 19 episode titled \\"Where My Country Gone?\\" with an original storyline catering to the show's irreverent and satirical style. The new episodes could deal with the townspeople addressing a new concern that reflects contemporary issues while maintaining the show's brand of humor. **Part 1: \\"Where My Freedom Went?\\"** - **Synopsis:** South Park Elementary is buzzing with the latest news: fourth-graders are now required to pass a comprehensive \\"Citizen Aptitude Test\\" (CAT) to ensure they understand the complexities of modern America. Kyle is anxious but confident, whereas Cartman views it as an infringement on his freedoms. Meanwhile, the rest of the town is grappling with a mysterious new law that lets the town government monitor citizens' every move for 'safety reasons.' - **Plot Points:** - Randy starts a movement against the new \\"Safe & Sound Surveillance\\" (S3) law by encouraging everyone to engage in nonsensical behavior, flooding the system with useless data. - Kyle and Stan form a study group to prepare for the CAT, but Cartman decides to lead a rebellion, claiming the tests are a form of mind control. - Butters is torn between obeying the rules and joining Cartman's rebellion but accidentally becomes a viral sensation for a misunderstanding during an S3 town broadcast. - PC Principal struggles to adapt the school curriculum quickly to ensure all \\"relevant social metrics\\" are included in the new test. - **Cliffhanger:** As Cartman's rebellion gains traction in school, a sudden twist reveals that the CEO of the company providing the surveillance tech is Garrison (the Trump-inspired character), who plans to leverage the data for a mysterious comeback campaign. The episode ends with a \\"to be continued...\\" as South Park residents march in a chaotic protest led by a triumphant Randy dressed as the Statue of Liberty. **Part 2: \\"Where My Data Went?\\"** - **Synopsis:** In the follow-up to the children's rebellion and Randy's movement against surveillance, the South Park citizens discover a dark truth about their data, prompting them to take on the corporate and political giants that have manipulated them. - **Plot Points:** - The kids take the CAT but find it full of ads and political bias, undermining its integrity and infuriating both parents and students. - Garrison's plot is to use the data to manipulate voters for his comeback campaign, pitting citizens against each other based on their secrets and fears. - The town bands together to outsmart the surveillance, using Kenny's mysteriously proficient hacking skills learned from online gaming. - Tweek and Craig use their artwork to satirize the state of privacy, inadvertently inspiring a town-wide art movement that cryptically exposes Garrison's plan. - **Resolution:** South Park ingeniously overloads the surveillance system with absurd false data. The town unites, with the children's rebellion and Randy's movement converging to crash Garrison's launch event. The closing scenes include a return to normalcy, Cartman begrudgingly accepting a passing grade despite his protest, and the town voting to dismantle the surveillance system, emphasizing the value of privacy and community. - **Closing Joke:** The episode ends with Cartman finding a new \\"conspiracy\\" to rage against: the \\"inherent bias\\" in cafeteria food choices, with a tease for his next absurd campaign."},{"instruction":"找一些图片","output":"很抱歉，我无法提供图片。请在网上搜索适合您需求的图片，例如Google图片、Unsplash、Pixabay等网站都是很好的资源。"},{"instruction":"写一封开发信","output":"尊敬的XXX公司团队， 我代表XXX开发团队写信与您联系，我们对贵公司的工作和成就感到非常钦佩。我了解到贵公司一直在致力于创新和技术的发展，并且在市场上取得了很大的成功。 我们是一支充满激情和经验丰富的开发团队，专注于提供高质量的软件解决方案和创新的技术支持。我们的团队拥有广泛的技术背景，涵盖了各种领域，包括Web开发、移动应用开发、大数据和人工智能等。无论是开发新的产品、为现有产品进行定制开发或改进现有系统，我们都具备丰富的经验和专业知识。 我们非常乐意与贵公司合作，共同推动发展。我们将根据贵公司的需求和目标，定制最适合的解决方案，并以高效和可持续的方式实施。我们致力于提供卓越的服务和支持，确保贵公司能够获得最好的结果。 我们期待与贵公司开展合作，共同创造更加美好的未来。如果您有任何疑问或需要进一步讨论，请随时与我联系。谢谢您抽出宝贵的时间阅读我们的来信。 最诚挚的问候， XXX开发团队"},{"instruction":"进口医疗器械的法国公司","output":"尊敬的先生/女士， 我是一位寻找进口医疗器械合作伙伴的医疗设备分销商，我了解到贵公司是一家法国的医疗器械公司。我对贵公司的产品线和市场声誉非常感兴趣，并希望能够与贵公司建立长期合作关系。 我们公司专注于提供高品质的医疗器械和设备，为医疗机构和专业医生提供最先进的解决方案。我们的客户遍布全球各地，我们希望能够引入贵公司的产品，以满足市场的需求和潜在的机会。 我们公司拥有广泛的分销网络，能够提供优质的市场推广和销售渠道，以确保贵公司的产品能够迅速进入市场并获得最佳的曝光度。我们的团队经验丰富，熟悉国际贸易和进口程序，可以帮助贵公司顺利在我们的目标市场进行销售。 如果贵公司对与我们合作感兴趣，我将非常乐意与贵公司进一步讨论合作细节和商务条款。我们期待着与贵公司建立起长期、互利共赢的合作关系，并共同推动医疗行业的发展。 请您告知方便的时间，我将安排适当的会议来进一步讨论。谢谢您抽出时间阅读我的来信，期待您的回复。 最诚挚的问候， XXX公司代表"},{"instruction":"微软公司的ceo邮箱","output":"很抱歉，我无法提供微软公司CEO的邮箱信息。为了与微软公司的高级管理层联系，建议您通过微软公司的官方网站或其他可靠渠道获取正确的联系方式。"},{"instruction":"美国地图","output":"很抱歉，作为一只语言模型，我无法提供图片或图形。我建议您在互联网上搜索美国地图，您可以在搜索引擎中输入\\"美国地图\\"或者访问地图相关网站以获取所需的信息和图像。常用的在线地图服务包括Google 地图、百度地图和OpenStreetMap等。"},{"instruction":"你好","output":"您好！有什么我可以帮助您的吗？"},{"instruction":"我想去ktv","output":"很高兴听到您想去KTV！以下是一些建议，希望能对您有所帮助： 1. 寻找附近的KTV场所：您可以在搜索引擎或地图应用程序中搜索附近的KTV场所。查看他们的评分和评价，选择适合您需求和预算的场所。 2. 预订包厢：一些繁忙的KTV可能需要提前预订包厢，以确保您有足够的空间和时间来享受K歌。您可以通过电话或在线平台进行预订。 3. 邀请朋友：邀请一些好朋友一起去KTV会增加乐趣和互动。确保您的朋友们也能适应KTV环境，并且大家都感兴趣参与。 4. 准备歌曲清单：提前准备一些您喜欢的歌曲清单，这样您在KTV时就可以顺利进行点歌。如果不确定要唱什么歌，KTV通常也会有歌曲目录供您选择。 5. 注意礼仪和音量：在KTV中要注意礼仪，遵守场所规定的规则和秩序。同时，控制音量，尊重其他包厢的客人，确保大家都能享受愉快的时光。 希望您在KTV度过愉快的时光！祝您玩得开心！"},{"instruction":"Please re word and polish this: The abstract of the study briefly captures the fundamental aspects of the project, delivering a clear overview of the initiatives taken and their consequent effects.
