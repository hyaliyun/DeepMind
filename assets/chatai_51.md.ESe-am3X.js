早上，我在学校广场上搭起了一个临时的调查摊位，并张贴了一份简短的调查问卷。问卷设计包括两个部分：第一部分是有关个人使用网络的情况，包括使用频率、受众群体等信息；第二部分则是关于网络舆论对大学生的价值观是否有影响以及具体影响的问题。 在开始收集数据之前，我首先进行了一些背景调查，询问了一些学生关于网络舆论的看法和对这项研究的兴趣。我发现大多数学生对这个话题很感兴趣，并且认为网络舆论对大学生的价值观有着重要的影响。这样的反应使我对调查结果更加期待。 随着时间的推移，越来越多的同学在我这里填写了问卷。我在一个小时内收集到了大约50份完整的问卷。在问卷收集的过程中，我也尽可能地与填写问卷的同学进行交流，以了解他们对这个话题的更多见解和意见。 根据初步的回答结果，我发现大学生并不是完全不受网络舆论的影响。有相当一部分同学表示，经常看到网络上的各种声音使他们不确定自己的观点和立场。有些同学甚至表示，他们会在网络上寻求指导，以确定自己的价值观。然而，也有一部分同学认为他们在面对网络舆论时能够保持自我，并不会完全被影响。 我还发现，大学生对于他们所关注的话题和信息源也存在着差异。有些同学更倾向于关注社会问题，他们认为通过网络了解这些问题可以拓宽视野，并加深对社会的认识。而另一些同学更多关注的是娱乐和个人兴趣，他们认为网络给他们提供了一个获取快速娱乐信息的渠道。 总的来说，这次社会实践使我意识到网络舆论对大学生的确有一定程度的影响。然而，这种影响是复杂而多样的，与个体的特点和选择息息相关。接下来，我将进一步分析收集到的数据，深入探讨这种影响的原因和机制。 结束了一天的调查工作，我感到非常充实和满足。通过这次社会实践，我不仅获得了宝贵的实地调查经验，还更深入地认识到了网络舆论对大学生的影响。我期待着未来几天的调查，希望能够进一步挖掘和分享这方面的研究成果，为大学生提供更好的网络舆论引导和帮助。"},{"instruction":"如果我的调查报告的题目是“网络舆论对大学生价值观的影响调查”，请你写一段调查（实践）的目的（意义或背景）","output":"调查（实践）目的（意义或背景）： 随着互联网的普及和社交媒体的兴起，网络舆论已经成为大学校园中不可忽视的力量。它不仅带来了信息的快速传播和沟通的便利，同时也对大学生的思想观念和价值观念产生了深远影响。因此，本次调查旨在探究网络舆论对大学生价值观的影响程度，并深入分析其中的原因和机制。 首先，了解网络舆论对大学生的影响，有助于我们更好地了解大学生的思想发展和成长环境。网络舆论扮演着社会舆论的重要角色，它呈现了社会各界的不同声音和观点。通过研究网络舆论对大学生的影响，我们可以对大学生接触到的各类信息进行深入剖析，进而了解大学生在信息获取和价值选择方面的主观能动性和特点。 其次，识别网络舆论对大学生的影响有助于我们提供有效的舆论引导和指导。了解大学生在网络舆论环境中的思想变动和行为变化，有利于我们为他们提供更恰当的舆论引导和团队教育。通过调查结果，我们可以发现网络舆论中存在的一些负面影响，例如价值观扭曲、群体思维等问题，从而采取相应的措施来加强大学生的价值观培养和舆论能力的提升。 最后，深入研究网络舆论对大学生的影响，对于推动网络环境的建设和提升大学生的网络素养具有重要意义。通过调查结果，我们可以为改善网络环境提供参考依据，探索更适合大学生发展的网络空间。同时，揭示网络舆论对大学生的影响还可以为相关政策、教育和研究提供理论指导和实践启示。 综上所述，本次调查的目的在于全面了解网络舆论对大学生价值观的影响程度以及具体影响的原因和机制，为提供有效的舆论引导和建设良好的网络环境提供科学依据，进一步促进大学生思想素质的全面发展。"},{"instruction":"请把下面的日文翻译成中文。どうだろう？ わきが見えてない……","output":"怎么样呢？我看不到你的腋窝……"},{"instruction":"As a prompt

The natural textures of the wood enhance the overall aesthetic, grounding the image and providing a sense of balance. The mood of the scene emanates an air of joy and serenity. The lemonade, with its tangy and refreshing qualities, brings a sense of delight and satisfaction. It evokes feelings of relaxation and quenching thirst on a warm summer day. The vibrant colors of the lemon orchard and the surrealistic vibe of the surroundings add a touch of whimsy, transporting the viewer to a world where everyday objects are infused with magic and wonder. This image can be realized in a variety of styles, but a photograph would capture the realistic essence of the lemonade with precision and clarity. Using a DSLR camera, such as the Canon EOS 5D Mark IV, with a macro lens (100mm) would allow for detailed close-ups of the lemonade glass, highlighting the textures and nuances of the drink. The shallow depth of field would blur the background slightly, drawing attention to the central subject. The photography style would aim to capture the lemonade in a natural and inviting way, simulating the experience of enjoying a glass of refreshing lemonade in person. /ar 1:1 /v 5.2"},{"instruction":"一家7口电费1000多正常吗？","output":"这要看具体情况来判断是否正常。一般来说，家庭里有7口人的话，每月电费超过1000多可能偏高。电费的多少会受到很多因素的影响，比如家庭的用电习惯、家电的能耗情况、天气状况等等。如果家中使用了一些高耗能的电器或者长时间使用电器，那么电费可能会增加；另外，如果使用了节能型电器、合理安排用电时间或者采用其他节能措施，电费可能会降低。总之，如果你认为家庭电费过高，可以考虑审查用电情况并采取一些节电措施。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The study, which analyzed data from over 100,000 adults, found that those who consumed eight or more servings of fruits and vegetables per day had a 22% lower risk of developing high blood pressure compared to those who consumed fewer than three servings per day. This finding supports previous research that has shown a link between a plant-based diet and lower blood pressure. Fruits and vegetables are rich in nutrients such as potassium, magnesium, and fiber, which have been associated with lower blood pressure levels. The researchers also found that certain fruits and vegetables had a stronger association with lower blood pressure. Berries, citrus fruits, and leafy greens were found to be particularly beneficial. The study's lead author, Dr. Giordano Pucci, highlighted the importance of increasing fruit and vegetable consumption to prevent high blood pressure, a condition that affects approximately one in three adults worldwide. While the study focused on the association between fruit and vegetable intake and blood pressure, it was observational and cannot prove cause and effect. Nonetheless, the findings suggest that incorporating more fruits and vegetables into one's diet may contribute to the prevention of high blood pressure. In conclusion, consuming a diet rich in fruits and vegetables may help lower the risk of high blood pressure. Further research is needed to better understand the mechanisms behind this association and to determine the optimal amount and types of fruits and vegetables for blood pressure management."},{"instruction":"如何在linux终端中打开grc文件","output":"要在Linux终端中打开GRC文件，您可以按照以下步骤操作： 1. 打开终端：您可以使用Ctrl + Alt + T快捷键来打开终端，或者在应用程序菜单中找到终端应用。 2. 切换到包含GRC文件的目录：使用\`cd\`命令切换到包含GRC文件的目录。例如，如果文件位于您的主目录中的\`Documents\`文件夹中，您可以使用以下命令进入该目录： \`\`\` cd ~/Documents \`\`\` 3. 使用文本编辑器打开GRC文件：您可以使用命令行文本编辑器（如nano或vi）来打开GRC文件。以下是使用nano编辑器的示例命令： \`\`\` nano filename.grc \`\`\` 同样，将\`filename.grc\`替换为您要打开的实际GRC文件的名称。 4. 在终端中打开GRC文件后，您可以浏览、编辑和保存文件。使用文本编辑器的指令进行操作。 请注意，在Linux中打开GRC文件可能需要安装适当的软件或工具。如果您尝试打开GRC文件时遇到问题，请确保您的系统上已经安装了与该文件类型相关的软件。"},{"instruction":"如何通过linux终端操作gnu radio","output":"在Linux终端中操作GNU Radio可以使用\`gnuradio-companion\`命令。以下是一些常用的GNU Radio命令行操作： 1. 启动GNU Radio Companion：在终端中输入以下命令来启动GNU Radio Companion： \`\`\` gnuradio-companion \`\`\` 2. 打开GNU Radio项目：在GNU Radio Companion中，您可以通过选择 \\"File\\" 菜单，然后点击 \\"Open\\" 来打开一个GNU Radio项目。您可以导航到项目所在的目录并选择相应的\`.grc\`文件。 3. 运行和停止GNU Radio流图：在GNU Radio Companion中，您可以通过点击 \\"Execute\\" 菜单，然后选择 \\"Run\\" 来运行GNU Radio流图。同样，您可以通过选择 \\"Execute\\" 菜单，然后选择 \\"Stop\\" 停止运行流图。 4. 导出GNU Radio流图：要导出GNU Radio流图为可执行文件，您可以在GNU Radio Companion中点击 \\"File\\" 菜单，然后选择 \\"Generate\\"。您可以选择要导出的文件类型，如Python代码或C++代码，并为导出文件选择保存位置。 5. 使用命令行运行GNU Radio脚本：GNU Radio流图也可以在不使用GNU Radio Companion的情况下通过命令行运行。在终端中，使用\`gnuradio\`命令后跟您的GNU Radio脚本文件路径来运行脚本。例如： \`\`\` gnuradio my_flowgraph.grc \`\`\` 6. 查看GNU Radio版本：您可以使用以下命令来查看在您的Linux系统上安装的GNU Radio版本： \`\`\` gnuradio-config-info --version \`\`\` 这些命令可以帮助您在Linux终端中进行GNU Radio操作。请注意，在使用GNU Radio之前，您可能需要安装GNU Radio软件包，可以使用Linux发行版的包管理器来安装。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

المختلفة مثل الإذاعات والقنوات التلفزيونية والصحف اليومية أو الأسبوعية بشكل متواضع. فالترويج كان مستمرًا ولكنه لم يكن بنفس الكثافة التي نشهدها اليوم. على سبيل المثال، اللاعب البرازيلي روماريو لم يحصل

في السنة، وأحيانًا قد يتم تجاهله في بعض المباريات. ولكن ما يحدث اليوم هو أمر مدهش ويفسر الشعبية الجارفة للاعبي كرة القدم حاليًا واستهانتهم بالأجيال السابقة. تخيل أنه لا يوجد لحظة واحدة تمر دون أن تشاهد فيها مقطع فيديو أو صورة أو منشورًا أو مقالًا عن لاعبك المفضل، وتجده أيضًا على صفحات وسائل التواصل الاجتماعي. هذا يعني أنه ليس برنامجًا تلفزيونيًّا أسبوعيًّا، بل ستجد كل خمس دقائق شخصًا جديدًا

What are the causes and what solutions can be taken to solve the problem?","output":"In today's fast-paced modern society, it has become increasingly difficult for people living in cities to get enough physical exercise. There are several causes behind this issue, including sedentary lifestyles, lack of time, and limited access to recreational spaces. However, several solutions can be implemented to tackle this problem and promote a healthier lifestyle. One of the primary causes of insufficient physical exercise in cities is the sedentary lifestyle that many individuals lead. With the advancements in technology and the rise of desk jobs, people spend long hours sitting, either in front of a computer screen or commuting in vehicles. This lack of movement leads to a decrease in physical activity and an overall sedentary lifestyle. Additionally, the fast-paced nature of urban life leaves little time for exercise and physical activity. People often find themselves overloaded with work, family responsibilities, and social commitments, leaving little to no time for exercise. This time constraint discourages individuals from engaging in physical activities due to perceived lack of time. Furthermore, limited access to recreational spaces in cities is another factor that hinders physical exercise. Urban areas are often crowded with buildings and concrete jungles, offering limited space for recreational activities such as parks, playgrounds, and sports facilities. This lack of convenient access to these spaces restricts people from engaging in physical activities on a regular basis. To address this issue, several solutions can be implemented. Firstly, creating awareness about the importance of physical exercise is crucial. Governments, schools, and communities should promote the benefits of regular physical activity and educate individuals on how to incorporate exercise into their daily lives. This could be done through campaigns, workshops, and awareness programs. Secondly, employers should encourage their employees to engage in physical activities by providing flexible working hours and promoting workplace wellness programs. This would enable individuals to find time for exercise during their busy work schedules and promote a healthy work-life balance. In addition, it is essential to create more recreational spaces in cities. Governments should invest in building parks, playgrounds, and sports facilities to provide individuals with accessible options for physical exercise. Public-private partnerships can also be explored to increase the number of recreational spaces in urban areas. Lastly, the development of infrastructure that encourages walking and cycling can significantly contribute to solving the problem. Building pedestrian-friendly paths, bicycle lanes, and promoting the use of public transportation can motivate individuals to opt for active transportation methods instead of relying solely on cars or public transport. In conclusion, the lack of physical exercise among city dwellers is primarily caused by sedentary lifestyles, time constraints, and limited access to recreational spaces. However, by raising awareness, providing flexibility at work, creating more recreational spaces, and developing infrastructure that promotes active transportation, this issue can be addressed effectively. Encouraging individuals to prioritize their physical well-being will not only improve their own health, but also contribute to the overall well-being of the society."},{"instruction":"你是英语翻译专家，请将下面的句子翻译为英文：我们将名字进行重命名，以更加清晰和准确的表达","output":"We will rename the name to achieve a clearer and more accurate expression."},{"instruction":"你是tex排版方面的专家，请问 参考文献排版中 unsrt 和 ACM-Reference-Format 有什么区别，请举一个例子说明。","output":"作为AI助手，我可以为您提供一些参考。在TeX排版中，\\"unsrt\\"和\\"ACM-Reference-Format\\"是两种不同的参考文献排版样式。它们之间的区别在于引用的排序和格式。 \\"unsrt\\"样式将参考文献按照它们在文中首次出现的顺序进行排序，并以此顺序进行编号。例如，如果文中首先引用了文献[3]，然后是[1]，最后是[2]，那么在引用部分，这些文献将按照[3]，[1]，[2]的顺序排序。 而\\"ACM-Reference-Format\\"是ACM（Association for Computing Machinery）的官方参考文献格式。它使用作者-年份的引用风格，并根据作者的姓氏和出版年份进行排序。例如，使用\\"ACM-Reference-Format\\"样式，如果引用的文献是Smith于2020年发表的，则在引用部分以Smith (2020)的格式显示。 总结来说，\\"unsrt\\"样式按照引用顺序进行排列，而\\"ACM-Reference-Format\\"样式按照作者和年份进行排序。以上是它们之间的一个简单例子解释，但请注意，具体的样式和格式可能会因具体的文献管理软件或模板而有所变化。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

According to logicism, mathematical concepts and truths can be derived from logical principles alone, eliminating the need for any separate mathematical objects or entities. The development of logicism can be traced back to the works of Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Frege's key contribution was his attempt to create a logical foundation for mathematics through his formulation of a formal deductive system called predicate logic. He believed that all mathematical concepts and truths could be reduced to logical concepts and principles. Following Frege, Russell further developed the logicist program by formulating a logical system using set theory, known as \\"type theory.\\" Russell's aim was to show that all mathematical concepts and theories could be expressed in terms of logical principles and set theory, ultimately reducing them to a formal logical foundation. Logicism faced several challenges and criticisms, notably from the likes of Kurt Gödel and the discovery of his incompleteness theorems in the 1930s. These theorems demonstrated the inherent limitations of formal systems, showing that there are true mathematical statements that cannot be proven within any consistent formal system. As a result, logicism's influence waned in the mid-20th century, with other foundationalist approaches, such as intuitionism and formalism, gaining prominence. However, some contemporary philosophers and mathematicians continue to explore and develop logicist ideas as a way to justify mathematical knowledge and establish a secure foundation for mathematics."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

NURBS surfaces require more complex mathematical calculations and operations compared to raster graphics which work with pixels and triangles. NURBS involve the manipulation of curves and surfaces defined by mathematical equations, thus requiring more computational power. To achieve real-time performance for NURBS, the hardware accelerator needs to handle complex floating-point calculations, interpolation, and evaluation of curves and surfaces. This necessitates the use of more transistors for implementing specialized computational units, such as floating-point units (FPUs), interpolation engines, and control units specific to NURBS calculations. Additionally, since NURBS involve higher-order mathematical functions, their computational requirements tend to be higher than raster graphics. This means that more transistors will be needed to provide the necessary processing power, memory access, and data handling capabilities for real-time rendering of NURBS surfaces. In summary, due to the increased complexity and computational requirements of NURBS, creating a real-time 3D NURBS accelerator would generally require significantly more transistors compared to traditional graphics accelerators used for raster graphics with similar performance targets."},{"instruction":"Is it true that creating a real-time 3D NURBS rasterizer would require significantly larger numbers of transistors for the same performance?","output":"No, it is not true that creating a real-time 3D NURBS rasterizer would require significantly larger numbers of transistors for the same performance. In fact, NURBS rasterization can be more computationally efficient and require fewer transistors compared to traditional raster graphics techniques like triangle-based rendering. NURBS rasterization involves converting NURBS curves and surfaces into pixels on a screen. It can be achieved using algorithms such as the De Casteljau's algorithm or the Bézier clipping algorithm. These algorithms are based on polynomial evaluations and interpolation techniques, which are computationally less complex than the calculations involved in traditional triangle rasterization. Unlike traditional raster graphics, which require extensive geometric processing and complex calculation of pixel coverage, NURBS rasterization can exploit the inherent smoothness and mathematical properties of NURBS curves and surfaces. This allows for efficient sampling and interpolation, resulting in potentially lower computational requirements. By leveraging techniques such as hierarchical evaluation, adaptive sampling, and curve/surface simplification, NURBS rasterization can achieve high-quality rendering with optimized performance and memory usage. This can enable a real-time 3D NURBS rasterizer to operate with comparable or even fewer transistors compared to traditional rasterizers while maintaining similar performance levels. It's worth noting that the specific implementation details, hardware architecture, and optimization strategies can also impact the transistor requirements for NURBS rasterizers. However, in general, creating a real-time 3D NURBS rasterizer may not require significantly larger numbers of transistors for the same performance when compared to traditional raster graphics techniques."},{"instruction":"Were there any attempts to bring Phong shading into real-time in the 90s?","output":"Yes, there were several attempts in the 1990s to bring Phong shading into real-time graphics. Phong shading, developed by Bui Tuong Phong in 1973, is a shading model that calculates the reflection of light on surfaces, resulting in smoother and more realistic shading. During the 90s, as real-time 3D graphics were rapidly evolving, there was a growing interest in achieving more realistic lighting and shading effects in interactive applications and games. Various techniques were explored to approximate or simulate Phong shading in real-time rendering. One popular approach was Gouraud shading, which aimed to achieve smoother shading by interpolating vertex colors across polygons. Though Gouraud shading does not precisely match Phong shading, it provided a good compromise between performance and realism, and many real-time engines of that era used this technique. Later in the 90s, graphics hardware manufacturers started to incorporate dedicated hardware support for lighting calculations. This led to the emergence of \\"hardware T&L\\" (Transform and Lighting) capabilities, where the graphics hardware could perform calculations for vertex transformations and lighting in parallel with rasterization. These hardware advancements allowed for more efficient real-time approximations of Phong shading by offloading some computations from the CPU. Additionally, alternative shading models and techniques were developed to achieve real-time lighting effects similar to Phong shading. One notable example is the \\"Blinn-Phong shading\\" model, which is a simplified version of the original Phong shading. Blinn-Phong shading provided a decent approximation of the specular lighting component and could be computed efficiently in real time. While achieving precise Phong shading in real-time was challenging due to its computational complexity, advancements in hardware, algorithmic optimizations, and alternative shading models during the 90s brought real-time rendering closer to the realistic lighting effects offered by Phong shading."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It focuses on analyzing and categorizing the names of things to better understand reality."},{"instruction":"What would a government based on the philosophy of the Logicians look like?","output":"A government based on the philosophy of the Logicians, also known as the School of Names, would likely prioritize the use of precise language and logical reasoning in its governance and decision-making processes. Here are some characteristics that such a government might exhibit: 1. Emphasis on Clarity and Precision: The government would prioritize clear, unambiguous communication, ensuring that laws, policies, and regulations are accurately formulated and effectively understood by all citizens. There would be a focus on logical consistency and coherence in the development and implementation of governance. 2. Rational Decision-making: The government would rely on logical reasoning and evidence-based thinking in its decision-making processes. Policy decisions would be based on careful analysis, critical thinking, and sound argumentation, with an emphasis on objective facts rather than personal biases or emotions. 3. Expertise and Education: The government would value knowledge and expertise, appointing qualified individuals with strong logical and analytical skills to key positions. Education would be highly valued, with an emphasis on logical thinking, rationality, and critical reasoning in the curriculum. 4. Transparency and Accountability: A government based on logical principles would prioritize transparency and accountability. Decision-making processes would be open to scrutiny, and citizens would have access to relevant information and the means to hold officials accountable. Claims and justifications made by the government would be subject to critical analysis and logical scrutiny. 5. Legal System: The legal system would rely on precise definitions, logical principles, and a coherent framework of laws and regulations. Laws would be formulated with clarity to avoid ambiguity and contradiction. The government would work to ensure that the legal system is fair, consistent, and based on logical reasoning. 6. Consensus-building: The government would seek to facilitate rational discourse and debate among different stakeholders to reach a consensus on important matters. Public participation and input would be encouraged, with logical arguments playing a central role in shaping policies and resolving conflicts. It is important to note that while these characteristics align with the principles of the Logicians, the practical implementation of any philosophy in governance would depend on various factors, including cultural context, societal needs, and the specific interpretation of the philosophy by the ruling authorities."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Can you tell me how I can start a YouTube food channel showcasing restaurants without showing my face to the audience?","output":"Certainly! If you prefer to start a YouTube food channel without showing your face, there are still plenty of ways to showcase restaurants and create engaging content. Here's how you can go about it: 1. Focus on the food and restaurant experience: Since you won't be showing your face, put the spotlight on the restaurants you visit and the food they serve. Capture appealing visuals of the dishes and emphasize the ambiance and decor of the restaurants you feature. 2. Use voiceovers: Instead of appearing on-camera, record voiceovers to narrate your videos. Describe the food, flavors, and your overall experience at the restaurant. Add interesting details, anecdotes, and recommendations to make your content engaging. 3. Showcase food preparation: Highlight how the food is prepared and cooked in the restaurant's kitchen. You can do this by filming chefs or kitchen staff in action or capturing behind-the-scenes footage. This adds an element of interest and allows viewers to see the process behind the dishes. 4. Leverage B-roll footage: Include high-quality B-roll shots of the restaurant's atmosphere, interior, and exterior. Show the ambiance, seating arrangements, unique decor, or any other elements that make each restaurant stand out. B-roll footage helps create a visually appealing video without relying on your face. 5. Feature interviews: Speak to the restaurant owners, chefs, or staff members about their specialties, inspirations, or story behind the restaurant. These interviews can add a personal touch to your videos and give viewers a deeper understanding of the restaurant. 6. Include text overlays: Utilize text overlays to provide key information such as the restaurant's name, location, hours of operation, or any relevant details viewers may find useful. Additionally, you can include fun food facts, trivia, or even catchy food quotes within the video. 7. Engage with your audience: Encourage your viewers to leave comments, ask questions, and suggest other restaurants to visit. Respond promptly to foster engagement and build a community around your channel. 8. Edit and enhance your videos: Use video editing software to refine your footage, add text, transitions, background music, and other effects to make your videos visually appealing. Experiment with different editing techniques to create a cohesive and professional-looking final product. Remember to respect and follow any regulations or permissions needed when filming inside restaurants. Focus on delivering high-quality content and providing valuable insights into the food and restaurants you feature. With dedication and consistent uploads, you can build an engaging food channel without showing your face."},{"instruction":"write 12 reviews staffin softwares with story - STAFFIN SOFTWARES emerged as a response to the need for transformation and innovation.

These friends, represented by the prime numbers p and q, possess exceptional qualities just like star players in a game. Similar to how these friends stand out from the crowd, prime numbers can only be divided evenly by 1 and themselves. The distinctness of p and q ensures a solid foundation for the RSA encryption algorithm, creating a perfect duo for an extraordinary adventure.</i></p> </div> <div> <h4>✖️ Calculate n by multiplying p and q: n = p * q</h4> <p class='description'><b>→ Combine the two special numbers into a larger number.</b> <i>Combining the powers of two extraordinary forces, represented by the prime numbers p and q, is like multiplying the strengths of two special players. Just as their strengths multiply when they join forces, the numbers p and q multiply to form a new and powerful number, n. This multiplication creates a robust and unbreakable lock mechanism that protects your valuable secrets, serving as the cornerstone of the RSA encryption algorithm.</i></p> </div> <div> <h4>⚖️ Calculate Euler's totient function of n: φ(n) = (p-1) * (q-1)</h4> <p class='description'><b>→ Do a magic trick that counts how many numbers play nicely with the larger number.</b> <i>Euler's totient function, represented by φ(n), is like a mysterious magic trick that counts how many numbers form a harmonious relationship with the larger number, n.

Put that message inside a special box, raise it to the power of the magic number, and take the remainder when divided by the larger number. The result is the encrypted message.</b> <i>Encryption is like sealing a secret message inside a special box. To encrypt a message M, we raise it to the power of the public exponent, e, and then take the remainder when divided by the larger number, n.

To decrypt the ciphertext C, we raise it to the power of the private exponent, d, and then take the remainder when divided by the larger number, n. This reverse transformation, using the private key associated with the public key used for encryption, turns the ciphertext back into the original message, represented by M.

Такой ИИ требует сложных алгоритмов и моделей машинного обучения, которые выходят за рамки одного ответа. Однако я могу поделиться некоторыми общими идеями, как вы можете построить подобную систему. Вам потребуется: 1. Создать или найти уже существующий набор данных, содержащий программы или коды на различных языках программирования. Набор данных должен быть размечен, чтобы модель могла понять связи между различными частями кода. 2. Составить модель машинного обучения, такую как рекуррентная нейронная сеть (RNN) или LSTM, которая будет обучаться на вашем наборе данных. Модель должна принимать входной код и генерировать соответствующие программы. 3. Настроить процесс обучения модели, выбрать соответствующий оптимизатор и функцию потерь. Найдите оптимальные параметры и гиперпараметры обучения, чтобы ваша модель могла генерировать правильные и полезные программы. 4. Создать механизм взаимодействия с пользователем, где пользователи могут предоставлять запросы или требования для генерации программы. Это может быть в формате командной строки, графического интерфейса или веб-сервиса. 5. Реализовать механизм для сохранения и загрузки модели, чтобы вы могли обучать модель и использовать ее для генерации программ при необходимости.

Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a 2022 American computer-animated adventure comedy film produced by DreamWorks Animation and distributed by Universal Pictures. The sequel to the spin-off film Puss in Boots (2011) and the sixth installment in the Shrek franchise, the film was directed by Joel Crawford and co-directed by Januel Mercado. Based on the character from Shrek 2 (2004) and inspired by the eponymous fairy tale, the film's screenplay was written by Paul Fisher and Tommy Swerdlow, with a story by Swerdlow and Tom Wheeler (the latter of whom wrote the 2011 film). The voice cast of Puss in Boots: The Last Wish includes Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek Pinault reprising their respective roles as the titular character and Kitty Softpaws, and are joined by Harvey Guillén, Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, Samson Kayo, John Mulaney, Wagner Moura, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, and Anthony Mendez, who voice new characters introduced in the film. In the film, set after the events of Shrek Forever After (2010), Puss in Boots teams up with Kitty and Perrito (Guillén) to find the mystical Last Wish for the Wishing Star to restore the first eight of his nine lives, before Goldilocks and her Three Bears Crime Family (Pugh, Winstone, Colman, and Kayo), and \\"Big\\" Jack Horner (Mulaney) do, while attempting to avoid a mysterious hooded wolf (Moura). Plans for a sequel to Puss in Boots began in November 2012, when executive producer Guillermo del Toro shared plans to take the titular character on an adventure to a \\"very exotic locale\\". Work on a sequel began in April 2014, according to Banderas. After being stuck in development hell, the project was revived in November 2018, with Illumination founder and CEO Chris Meledandri confirmed to be an executive producer. It was announced that the film would be helmed by Bob Persichetti, the head of story of the first film and one of the three directors of Sony Pictures Animation's Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018), in February 2019. Crawford was later announced as the new director in March 2021, along with Mercado. The story draws inspiration from Spaghetti Western films, with The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) being cited as a particular influence. As with DreamWorks' previous film The Bad Guys (2022), the film has a stylized animation style, inspired by Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. With new technology, the team was able to give the film a painterly style to resemble a fairy-tale story, rather than utilizing the realistic visual style of previous installments in the Shrek franchise. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish premiered at Lincoln Center in New York City on December 13, 2022, and was theatrically released in the United States on December 21, 2022, after being delayed due to restructuring at DreamWorks. The film was a sleeper hit, becoming a critical and commercial success and grossing over 484 million worldwide on a production budget of 90–110 million and becoming the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2022. At the 95th Academy Awards it was nominated for Best Animated Feature, as well as receiving nominations at the Golden Globes, Critics' Choice Awards, and British Academy Film Awards.","output":"I apologize for the confusion, but I am unable to provide the official Ukrainian dubbing-text for the detailed information you have provided about Puss in Boots: The Last Wish.

Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a 2022 American computer-animated adventure comedy film produced by DreamWorks Animation and distributed by Universal Pictures. The sequel to the spin-off film Puss in Boots (2011) and the sixth installment in the Shrek franchise, the film was directed by Joel Crawford and co-directed by Januel Mercado. Based on the character from Shrek 2 (2004) and inspired by the eponymous fairy tale, the film’s screenplay was written by Paul Fisher and Tommy Swerdlow, with a story by Swerdlow and Tom Wheeler (the latter of whom wrote the 2011 film). The voice cast of Puss in Boots: The Last Wish includes Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek Pinault reprising their respective roles as the titular character and Kitty Softpaws, and are joined by Harvey Guillén, Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, Samson Kayo, John Mulaney, Wagner Moura, Da’Vine Joy Randolph, and Anthony Mendez, who voice new characters introduced in the film. In the film, set after the events of Shrek Forever After (2010), Puss in Boots teams up with Kitty and Perrito (Guillén) to find the mystical Last Wish for the Wishing Star to restore the first eight of his nine lives, before Goldilocks and her Three Bears Crime Family (Pugh, Winstone, Colman, and Kayo), and “Big” Jack Horner (Mulaney) do, while attempting to avoid a mysterious hooded wolf (Moura). Plans for a sequel to Puss in Boots began in November 2012, when executive producer Guillermo del Toro shared plans to take the titular character on an adventure to a “very exotic locale”. Work on a sequel began in April 2014, according to Banderas. After being stuck in development hell, the project was revived in November 2018, with Illumination founder and CEO Chris Meledandri confirmed to be an executive producer. It was announced that the film would be helmed by Bob Persichetti, the head of story of the first film and one of the three directors of Sony Pictures Animation’s Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018), in February 2019. Crawford was later announced as the new director in March 2021, along with Mercado. The story draws inspiration from Spaghetti Western films, with The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) being cited as a particular influence. As with DreamWorks’ previous film The Bad Guys (2022), the film has a stylized animation style, inspired by Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. With new technology, the team was able to give the film a painterly style to resemble a fairy-tale story, rather than utilizing the realistic visual style of previous installments in the Shrek franchise. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish premiered at Lincoln Center in New York City on December 13, 2022, and was theatrically released in the United States on December 21, 2022, after being delayed due to restructuring at DreamWorks. The film was a sleeper hit, becoming a critical and commercial success and grossing over 484 million worldwide on a production budget of 90–110 million and becoming the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2022. At the 95th Academy Awards it was nominated for Best Animated Feature, as well as receiving nominations at the Golden Globes, Critics’ Choice Awards, and British Academy Film Awards.","output":"Зроблю офіційний український дубляжевий текст офіційного трейлера фільму \\"Кіт у чоботях: Останнє бажаня\\". \\"Кіт у чоботях: Останнє бажання\\" - це американський комп'ютерно-анимаційний пригодницько-комедійний фільм 2022 року виробництва DreamWorks Animation та дистриб’юції Universal Pictures. Це продовження фільму-спін-оффу \\"Кіт у чоботях\\" (2011) та шоста частина у франшизі \\"Шрек\\". Фільм був знятий Джоелом Кравфордом та співрежисером Джануель Меркадо. На основі персонажа з \\"Шрек 2\\" (2004) і натхненного однойменною казкою, сценарій фільму написав Пол Фішер і Томмі Свердлоу, історію підготували Свердлоу та Том Вілер (останній з яких написав фільм 2011 року). У головних ролях озвучування \\"Кота у чоботях: Останнє бажання\\" Антоніо Бандерас і Сальма Хайек Піно, які повторюють свої ролі Кота в рукавичцях і М’якої Лапки, а також Гарві Гійен, Флоренс П'ю, Олівія Колман, Рей Вінстон, Самсон Кайо, Джон Мулані, Вагнер Моура, Д’Вайн Джой Рандольф та Ентоні Мендез, які озвучують нових персонажів, що вперше з'явилися в фільмі. У фільмі, розташованому після подій фільму \\"Шрек назавжди\\" (2010), Кіт у чоботях об'єднується з М'якою Лапкою та Перріто (Гійен) для пошуку містичного Останнього Бажання, щоб відновити перші вісім з дев'яти своїх життів, перш ніж Голділокс і її бригада Трьох Ведмедів (П'ю, Вінстон, Колман, і Кайо) та \\"Великий\\" Джек Хорнер (Мулані) зроблять це, намагаючись уникнути таємничого одягненого вовка (Моура). Плани щодо створення продовження \\"Кота у чоботях\\" з'явились у листопаді 2012 року, коли виконавчий продюсер Гильермо дель Торо розповів про плани персонажа відправитися у пригоду в \\"дуже екзотичну локацію\\". Робота над продовженням розпочалася у квітні 2014 року, за словами Бандераса. Після того, як проект зупинився в розвитку, він був відроджений у листопаді 2018 року, коли засновник та генеральний директор Illumination Кріс Меледандрі був підтверджений як виконавчий продюсер. В лютому 2019 року було оголошено, що фільм буде знятий Бобом Персикетті, головним репортером першого фільму та одним з трьох режисерів \\"Павук: Навколо світу\\" (2018) від Sony Pictures Animation. Кравфорд був пізніше оголошений новим режисером у березні 2021 року, разом з Меркадо. Сюжет надихнуто спагетті-вестернами, зокрема фільмом \\"Добрий, поганий, злий\\" (1966). Відповідно до попереднього фільму DreamWorks \\"Погані хлопці\\" (2022), у фільмі використано стилізований анімаційний стиль, натхненний \\"Павуком: Навколо світу\\". За допомогою новітніх технологій команда змогла створити в фільмі художній стиль, подібний до казки, а не використовувати реалістичний візуальний стиль попередніх частин франшизи \\"Шрек\\". \\"Кіт у чоботях: Останнє бажання\\" відбувся прем’єру в Лінкольн-центрі в Нью-Йорку 13 грудня 2022 року і був повним успіхом, ставши критичним і комерційним успіхом. Він заробив понад 484 мільйони доларів по всьому світу при бюджеті від 90 до 110 мільйонів доларів, ставши десятим найдохіднішим фільмом 2022 року. На 95-й церемонії вручення премії \\"Оскар\\" він був номінований у категорії \\"Найкращий анімаційний фільм\\", а також отримав номінації на премії \\"Золотий глобус\\", \\"Критикс' Майнтства\\" та \\"Британської академії кіно\\"."},{"instruction":"增值评价","output":"增值评价是对某个人、组织、产品或服务的价值的评估和判断。它涉及到对所评价对象的贡献、创新、效益等方面的综合评估。在商业领域中，增值评价通常与价值创造和商业模式创新紧密相关。一个与其他竞争者相比能够提供更高的价值和创新的企业或产品，往往会受到消费者、投资者和市场的青睐，从而实现增值和成功。同时，对于个人而言，通过提升自身技能、知识和经验，为雇主或市场提供独特的价值，也可以实现增值。"},{"instruction":"教学评价中的增值评价","output":"在教学评价中，增值评价是指对教师教学能力和教学质量的评价，主要考察教师对学生学习的贡献程度。增值评价关注的是教学的改进和进步，以及对学生学习成果的促进。 在增值评价中，主要考察以下几个方面： 1. 学生学业成绩改进: 评估教师对学生学业成绩的作用程度，通常通过学生的测试、考试成绩以及学年进步来进行评估。 2. 学生能力和技能提升: 评估教师对学生学习能力和技能的培养程度，例如学生在课程结束时所具备的各种能力和技能是否得到提升。 3. 学生学习动力和参与度: 评估教师对学生学习动力和参与度的影响，例如学生的主动性、积极性、学习态度和参与度是否得到提高。 4. 学生学习兴趣和思维能力培养: 评估教师对学生学习兴趣和思维能力的培养程度，包括学生对知识的探究、创新思维和批判性思维的培养。 增值评价通过对学生在某段时间内的学习情况和成绩的改进进行评估，以判断教师在教学过程中所作贡献的大小。这种评价方法能够帮助教师了解自己的教学效果，及时调整教学策略，提升教学质量。同时，增值评价也可以提供反馈给学生，帮助他们了解自己的学习进展并提供改进的方向。"},{"instruction":"Expliquez clairement l'architecture logicielle","output":"L'architecture logicielle désigne la structure d'un système informatique, déterminant comment ses composants interagissent entre eux et avec l'environnement.

The first wave of Chinese immigrants arrived in the mid-19th century during the California Gold Rush, while the second wave came after the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act. These two waves of Chinese immigrants have had vastly different experiences in the United States, from being seen as a dangerous \\"Yellow Peril\\" to being celebrated as a successful \\"Model Minority.\\" What happened during the 100 years in between that caused such drastic changes of perception? This micro course aims to compare these two waves of Chinese immigration and analyze the transformation of the Chinese-American image over time by looking at different push and pull factors at work behind the two waves. Why do the Chinese want to go to the United States? Generally, Immigration to the United States is driven by a combination of push and pull factors. Push factors refer to circumstances in a person's home country that encourage them to leave. They include political instability, economic hardships, lack of job opportunities, poverty, natural disasters, and so on. By contrast, pull factors are the attractions and opportunities that draw individuals to the United States, such as political stability, economic prosperity, more job opportunities, higher wages, better education, and the chance for a better quality of life. Overall, push and pull factors work together like the two sides of the same coin. Let’s use the push and pull factors to analyze the two waves of Chinese immigration to the US. The first wave of Chinese immigrants came to the United States in the mid-19th century primarily to escape poverty and political turmoil in China. During the late Qing Dynasty, China experienced economic decline and political instability, as frequent floods, droughts and famine in southern China pushed many individuals to search for a more stable life. Meanwhile, the Opium Wars and the Taiping Rebellion disrupted societal order and created an environment of insecurity and uncertainty, compelling many Chinese to seek better opportunities abroad. On the other hand, the United States was long regarded as a land of opportunities. The discovery of gold in California in 1848 attracted thousands of Chinese laborers who sought fortune in the gold mines. The construction of the Transcontinental Railroad also provided employment opportunities for Chinese immigrants. Many of the early Chinese immigrants worked as laborers in mines, on the railroad or in the laundry business. They faced discrimination and hostility from white European immigrants, who saw them as a threat to their jobs and way of life and referred to them as the Yellow Peril. They were also portrayed in the media as exotic, sinister, and unassimilable. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was a clear sign of the government's hostility towards Chinese immigrants. The second wave of Chinese immigrants came to the United States after the 1965 passage of Immigration Act which eliminated the national-origins quota system. Here we see more pull factors at work, because the United States experienced a post-war economic boom, creating demand for labor in various sectors, including education, technology, and healthcare, and. Many of the Chinese immigrants were highly educated professionals, such as scientists, engineers, and doctors, who were recruited by American universities and companies. These Chinese immigrants faced a more welcoming reception from mainstream society. They were often seen as the \\"Model Minority,\\" a term coined in the 1960s to describe Asian Americans who were perceived as successful, hardworking, and law-abiding. The second wave of Chinese immigrants faced a more welcoming reception from mainstream society, although they still faced discrimination and stereotypes. They were often seen as the \\"Model Minority,\\" a term coined in the 1960s to describe Asian Americans as a successful and assimilated group, who had overcome the obstacles of discrimination and prejudice through education and hard work. In conclusion, the experiences of the two waves of Chinese immigrants to the United States have been vastly different, from being marginalized and discriminated against in the 19th century to becoming integral contributors to American society in the 20th century. However, even the model minority stereotype had negative consequences for both Asians and other minority groups, as Asian Americans are expected to be quiet and submissive, while other minority groups are discriminated against because of their perceived inferiority to the Chinese Americans. Understanding this transformation and its root causes and consequences can help shed light on the challenges faced by Chinese immigrants, and their resilience in shaping a positive Chinese-American identity.","output":"To create a PowerPoint presentation based on the provided content, you can follow these steps: 1.

This multiplication creates a robust and unbreakable lock mechanism that protects your valuable secrets, serving as the cornerstone of the RSA encryption algorithm.</i></p> </div> <div> <h4>⚖️ Calculate Euler’s totient function of n: φ(n) = (p-1) * (q-1) <span id=“totientFunction”></span></h4> <p class=‘description’><b>→ Do a magic trick that counts how many numbers play nicely with the larger number.</b> <i>Euler’s totient function, represented by φ(n), is like a mysterious magic trick that counts how many numbers form a harmonious relationship with the larger number, n. Just as the special numbers had no common factors with the larger number in the previous step, these numbers also have no common factors. The totient function, like a magician’s wand, reveals this hidden count, holding the key to unlocking the secrets of encryption and decryption in the RSA algorithm.</i></p> </div> <div> <h4>🔑 Select a public exponent e, relatively prime to φ(n) <span id=“publicExponent”></span></h4> <p class=‘description’><b>→ Choose a magic number that doesn’t have any common factors with the result of the magic trick.</b> <i>Choosing a public exponent, denoted as e, is like finding a special key that unlocks the encryption process. This key, represented by the letter ‘e’, must be uniquely different from the result obtained in the previous step. Just like a key code completely different from a magic trick result, the public exponent ensures secure encryption by having no common factors with Euler’s totient function of n (φ(n)).</i></p> </div> <div> <h4>🔢 Calculate the private exponent d, satisfying (d * e) % φ(n) = 1 <span id=“privateExponent”></span></h4> <p class=‘description’><b>→ Through some mathematical magic, find a secret number that, when multiplied by the magic number and divided by the result of the magic trick, results in an answer of 1.</b> <i>Calculating the private exponent, represented by d, is like solving a math puzzle to discover the secret number that, when multiplied by the public exponent ‘e’ and divided by Euler’s totient function of n (φ(n)), equals 1. This special number, known only to the owner, unlocks and decrypts messages encrypted using the public key. The relationship between d, e, and φ(n) guarantees the ability to reverse the encryption process and reveal the original message.</i></p> </div> <div> <h4>🌐 Public Key: (e, n)</h4> <p class=‘description’><b>→ The public key is like a toy that everyone can play with. It has two numbers: the magic number and the larger number.</b> <i>The public key, represented as (e, n), is like a toy that can be freely shared among friends. It consists of two numbers: the public exponent, e, and the larger number, n. Just as a toy brings joy to multiple people, the public key enables secure communication between sender and recipient. The magic number, e, serves as the key to unlocking the encryption process, and the larger number, n, forms the foundation of the encryption algorithm.</i></p> </div> <div> <h4>📂 Encryption: To encrypt a message M, compute C = (M^e) % n</h4> <p class=‘description’><b>→ Imagine you have a secret message. Put that message inside a special box, raise it to the power of the magic number, and take the remainder when divided by the larger number. The result is the encrypted message.</b> <i>Encryption is like sealing a secret message inside a special box. To encrypt a message M, we raise it to the power of the public exponent, e, and then take the remainder when divided by the larger number, n. This transformation turns the message into an unreadable form, represented by the ciphertext, C. It’s like protecting the secret message with an unbreakable seal, ensuring that only the intended recipient with the private key can unlock and read it.</i></p> </div> <div> <h4>🔓 Decryption: To decrypt the ciphertext C, compute M = (C^d) % n</h4> <p class=‘description’><b>→ If you have the encrypted message and the secret numbers, take the encrypted message, raise it to the power of the secret number, and take the remainder when divided by the larger number.

To decrypt the ciphertext C, we raise it to the power of the private exponent, d, and then take the remainder when divided by the larger number, n. This reverse transformation, using the private key associated with the public key used for encryption, turns the ciphertext back into the original message, represented by M.

Schreibe aus der Sicht und auf dem Sprachniveau eines Schülers aus der neunten Klasse.","output":"Breakdance – Ein cooler Tanzstil Hallo liebe Mitschülerinnen und Mitschüler, heute möchte ich euch gerne etwas über das Thema Breakdance erzählen. Breakdance ist ein Tanzstil, der in den 1970er Jahren in den Straßen von New York City entstanden ist und sich seitdem weltweit verbreitet hat. Es handelt sich um einen sehr coolen und energetischen Tanz, bei dem man verschiedene akrobatische Moves macht. Bei Breakdance geht es vor allem um Kraft, Flexibilität und Koordination. Die Tänzerinnen und Tänzer machen viele akrobatische Bewegungen wie Flips, Spins und Handstände. Außerdem gehören auch schnelle Fußarbeit und coole Posen dazu. Man könnte sagen, Breakdancer sind regelrechte Athleten auf dem Tanzparkett. Ein wichtiger Bestandteil des Breakdance ist der sogenannte \\"B-Boy-Groove\\". Das ist der typische Beat oder Rhythmus, zu dem die Tänzerinnen und Tänzer ihre Moves machen. Oft tanzen die B-Boys und B-Girls (so nennt man die Breakdancer) zu Hip-Hop-Musik. Wichtig ist, dass man den Rhythmus spürt und sich zur Musik bewegt. Breakdance ist nicht nur ein Tanzstil, sondern auch eine Kultur. Die Tänzerinnen und Tänzer gehören oft zu Crews, das heißt zu Gruppen von Breakdancern, die zusammen auftreten und trainieren. Sie haben spezielle Namen wie \\"Rock Steady Crew\\" oder \\"The Flying Steps\\". In ihren Crews entwickeln sie neue Moves und Tricks und teilen ihr Wissen untereinander. Dabei geht es auch um Teamwork und Zusammenhalt. Eine bekannte Disziplin im Breakdance ist der \\"Battles\\". Dabei treten zwei Tänzerinnen oder Tänzer gegeneinander an und zeigen ihre besten Moves. Sie versuchen, sich gegenseitig zu übertreffen und das Publikum zu beeindrucken. Die Battles finden oft auf speziellen Breakdance-Events statt und können sehr spannend sein. Breakdance ist nicht ohne Risiko. Bei den akrobatischen Moves besteht immer die Gefahr, sich zu verletzen. Deshalb ist es wichtig, sich vor dem Tanzen gut aufzuwärmen und auf die eigenen Grenzen zu achten. Außerdem sollte man immer mit einem guten Trainer trainieren, der einem die richtige Technik beibringt. Wer Breakdance lernen möchte, kann das in Tanzschulen oder in Jugendzentren tun. Dort gibt es oft eigene Breakdance-Gruppen, in denen man trainieren kann. Es ist allerdings wichtig, geduldig zu sein, da Breakdance keine einfache Tanzrichtung ist und viel Übung erfordert. Zusammenfassend kann man sagen, dass Breakdance ein cooler Tanzstil ist, bei dem es um Kraft, Koordination und akrobatische Moves geht. Es ist ein Teil der Hip-Hop-Kultur und bietet die Möglichkeit, sich kreativ auszudrücken. Wer Lust hat, kann sich gerne mal ein paar Breakdance-Videos anschauen und vielleicht selbst den ein oder anderen Move ausprobieren. Vielen Dank für eure Aufmerksamkeit.

Там была переписка с бывшей девушкой. Сегодня он весь день провоцировал меня на скандал. Так как завтра должны были поехать в деревню мы наш сын и его мама, но он не хочет, что бы ехала я и я так понимаю таким образом он пытался вызвать большой скандал что бы я не ехала. Я не удержалась и проговорилась про переписку. Он выходил курить в этот момент, когда вкрнулся начал показывать телефон желая меня дурой переписка была уже удалена. Но стало все хуже, он перестал со мной говорить, запретил у себе прикасаться. Стал говорить что это не его дом, а когда я спросила вернётся ли он сюда после деревни он сказал что приедет у сыну Ко всему прочему он стал скрывать доходы, сумма которые он даёт на продукты уменьшилась раза в два, и когда я говорю о том что на это не прожить, он говорит иди работать. Хотя именно из за него и не работаю (подработка есть но не стабильная). У нас ребенок первы год в саду и постоянно на больничных. Он говорил что бы я не работала а занималась домом.

On the other hand, the internal structure of mesopores in the lower metamorphic zone is complex, and the connectivity is not uniformly distributed.","output":"The FHH equation was employed to analyze the fractal characteristics of the nitrogen adsorption curve, and the results for fractal dimension calculations are displayed in Figure 10. The curves exhibited distinct adsorption characteristics at different relative pressure levels, indicating the evident presence of fractal characteristics in the samples. Upon calculating the nitrogen adsorption experimental data, it was found that the fractal dimension for sample D1 ranged from 2.396 to 2.796, with an average value of 2.531. Similarly, for sample D2, the fractal dimension varied from 2.018 to 2.796, with an average value of 2.64. These findings suggest that diabase intrusion leads to a decrease in the fractal dimension within the high metamorphic zone. Consequently, the internal pore structure of mesopores tends to become flatter, resulting in enhanced permeability and a more uniform distribution of pores. Conversely, the low metamorphic zone exhibits a complex internal structure of mesopores, featuring a more uniform distribution of pores. Furthermore, the internal structure of mesopores in the lower metamorphic zone is complex, and the connectivity is not uniformly distributed."},{"instruction":"The fractal dimension analysis of the morphological characteristics of the high-pressure mercury pressure experimental curves of the samples in the study area (Table 3) showed that the pore fractal dimension Dα ranged from 2.7808-2.9997, with an average value of 2.9746. The fractal dimension Dα of the metamorphic zone ranged from 2 to 3 after the intrusion of pyrochlore, and the Dα inhomogeneity of different metamorphic shale samples was obvious (Figure 11). The analysis shows that the fractal dimension keeps increasing with the increase of the influence of diabase intrusion, and the macroporosity becomes more complex and non-homogeneous.","output":"The analysis of the morphological characteristics of the high-pressure mercury pressure experimental curves for the samples in the study area (as shown in Table 3) revealed the fractal dimension of the pores, denoted as Dα.

It was observed that after the intrusion of pyrochlore, the fractal dimension Dα in the metamorphic zone ranged from 2 to 3, and there was a clear variation in Dα among different metamorphic shale samples (as depicted in Figure 11). The analysis suggests that the fractal dimension increases with the growing influence of diabase intrusion, resulting in a more complex and non-homogeneous macroporosity."},{"instruction":"According to Loucks[4], the shale forms pores with a wide range of pore sizes, making it inappropriate to assess pore structure using just one method. Nitrogen adsorption and high-pressure mercury intrusion are the best methods to evaluate mesopores (2-50nm) and macropores (>50nm), respectively. In order to fully analyze the pore structure of the lacustrine shale over a pore (throat) size range of 2 nm to several hundred microns, N2 adsorption and mercury intrusion are combined in this study. Diabase intrusion has an important influence on the pore structure of lacustrine shale, but different metamorphic zones have different effects under different influences. First, the SSA, TPV, and Pore diameters of mesopores and macropores in the low-grade metamorphic zone are larger than those of normal shale, but the improvement of SSA and TPV of mesopores is higher than that of macropores, but the improvement of mesopore diameter is lower than that of macropores. It shows that the diabase intrusion mainly improves the shale in the low-grade metamorphic zone, and the improvement degree of mesopores is greater than that of macropores, but the expansion effect of mesopores is much worse than that of macropores (Fig.12). Secondly, the SSA and TPV of mesopores and macropores in the high-grade metamorphic zone and the intrusion center zone are much smaller than those of normal shale, and the damage to mesopores is higher than that of macropores; The effect of diameter expansion is greater than that of mesopores. It shows that the diabase intrusion has a destructive effect on the shale in the high-grade metamorphic zone, and the negative effect on mesopores is much greater than that of macropores, but the diameter expansion effect of mesopores is much worse than that of macropores (Fig.12). To sum up, after the lacustrine shale is affected by the intrusion of diabase, the SSA, TPV and Pore diameter of the low-grade metamorphic rocks are improved, while the high-grade metamorphic zone is mainly damaged, and the intrusion of diabase The effect on mesopores is much greater than that of macropores.","output":"According to Loucks[4], shale possesses pores with a diverse range of sizes, making it inappropriate to rely on a single method to assess pore structure. Nitrogen adsorption and high-pressure mercury intrusion are considered the best techniques for evaluating mesopores (2-50nm) and macropores (>50nm), respectively. Therefore, in this study, a combination of N2 adsorption and mercury intrusion was employed to fully analyze the pore structure of the lacustrine shale over a pore (throat) size range of 2 nm to several hundred microns. The intrusion of diabase plays a significant role in impacting the pore structure of lacustrine shale. However, the effects differ within different metamorphic zones under varying influences. Firstly, in the low-grade metamorphic zone, the specific surface area (SSA), total pore volume (TPV), and pore diameters of mesopores and macropores are larger compared to normal shale. However, the improvement in SSA and TPV for mesopores is higher than that for macropores, though the increase in mesopore diameter is lower than that of macropores. This suggests that diabase intrusion primarily enhances the shale in the low-grade metamorphic zone, with a greater impact on mesopores than macropores. However, the expansion effect on mesopores is considerably weaker than that observed for macropores (as depicted in Fig. 12). Secondly, in the high-grade metamorphic zone and the intrusion center zone, both the SSA and TPV of mesopores and macropores are significantly lower compared to normal shale. The damage inflicted upon mesopores is greater than that suffered by macropores, with the effect on pore diameter expansion being more pronounced in macropores. This indicates that diabase intrusion has a destructive effect on the shale within the high-grade metamorphic zone, with a greater negative impact on mesopores than macropores. However, the expansion effect on mesopores is noticeably weaker compared to macropores (as illustrated in Fig. 12). In summary, following the intrusion of diabase on lacustrine shale, the SSA, TPV, and pore diameter of low-grade metamorphic rocks experience improvements. Conversely, the high-grade metamorphic zone is predominantly damaged, and the diabase intrusion significantly affects mesopores more than macropores."},{"instruction":"Ein Patient oder Patientin ruft beim Sekretr einer Arztpraxis an und soll ihren Namen sagen.

Thus, ( f(n) mid f(an) ) for any positive integers ( n ) and ( a ). 2. **Claim: ( f(f(n)) mid n ) for any positive integer ( n ).**    - Proof: The numbers ( x ) with ( f(n) mid f(x) ) have period exactly ( f(f(n)) ). However, ( x = n ) satisfies ( f(n) mid f(x) ). Also, ( x = 2n ) satisfies ( f(n) mid f(x) ).    - Therefore, ( f(f(n)) mid 2n - n = n ). (blacksquare) 3. **Claim: ( f(f(p)) = p ) for any prime ( p ).**    - Proof: Note that ( f(f(p)) mid p ), so ( f(f(p)) in {1, p} ) for all primes ( p ).    - If ( f(x) = 1 ) for some ( x > 1 ), then in the problem condition setting ( m = x - 1 ) and ( n = x ) gives ( x mid f(x) ), which is a contradiction.    - So ( f(f(p)) > 1 ), which implies ( f(f(p)) = p ). (blacksquare) 4. **Analyzing the divisibility properties:**    - If ( f(p) mid x ), then ( p mid f(f(p)) mid f(x) ), and if ( p mid x ), then ( f(p) mid f(x) ). 5. **Claim: If ( n mid f(n) ) for some positive integer ( n ), then ( f(n) = n ).**    - Proof: Let ( f(n) = cn ). Note that since ( f(f(n)) mid n ), we have ( f(cn) mid n mid f(n) ).    - However, ( f(n) mid f(cn) ), so ( f(n) mid n ), which implies ( c = 1 ), so ( f(n) = n ). (blacksquare) 6. **Considering the least common multiple (LCM):**    - ( f(p) mid mathrm{lcm}(p, f(p)) ), so ( p mid f(mathrm{lcm}(p, f(p))) ) and ( p mid mathrm{lcm}(p, f(p)) ), so ( f(p) mid mathrm{lcm}(p, f(p)) ).    - Thus, ( mathrm{lcm}(p, f(p)) mid f(mathrm{lcm}(p, f(p))) ), which implies that ( f(mathrm{lcm}(p, f(p))) = mathrm{lcm}(p, f(p)) ). 7. **Conclusion:**    - It suffices to show that ( mathrm{lcm}(p, f(p)) ) can take on infinitely many values. Suppose not and for some prime ( p ), ( mathrm{lcm}(p, f(p)) ) is maximal.    - Set ( q ) to be a prime greater than ( pf(p) ).

A partition (A_1, A_2) of A is good if operatorname{lcm}(A_1) = operatorname{gcd}(A_2). For each a_i in A_1 and a_j in A_2, it must hold that a_i leq d leq a_j for some integer d, implying: [A_1 = {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k}, quad A_2 = {a_{k+1}, a_{k+2}, ldots, a_n}] for some k with 1 leq k < n. Each good partition is determined by a specific a_k, called the partitioning element. Define: [ell_k = operatorname{lcm}(a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k)] [g_k = operatorname{gcd}(a_{k+1}, a_{k+2}, ldots, a_n)]  Step 3: Partitioning Criterion a_k is partitioning if ell_k = g_k.  Step 4: Proving the Claim Claim: If both a_{k-1} and a_k are partitioning elements for 2 leq k leq n-1, then g_{k-1} - g_k = a_k. [ begin{aligned} &text{Proof: Assume a_{k-1} and a_k are partitioning elements. Then:}  &ell_{k-1} = g_{k-1} implies ell_{k-1} mid a_k implies operatorname{lcm}(ell_{k-1}, a_k) = a_k = g_k end{aligned} ]  Step 5: Properties Based on the Claim **Property 1**: For every k = 2, 3, ldots, n-2, at least one of a_{k-1}, a_k, and a_{k+1} is not partitioning. [ begin{aligned} &text{Proof: Suppose, to the contrary, that a_{k-1}, a_k, and a_{k+1} are all partitioning.}  &text{The claim yields } a_{k+1} = g_k = a_k, text{ a contradiction.} end{aligned} ] **Property 2**: Elements a_1 and a_2 cannot both be partitioning. Similarly, a_{n-2} and a_{n-1} cannot both be partitioning. [ begin{aligned} &text{Proof: Assume a_1 and a_2 are both partitioning. Then } ell_1 = g_1 = a_1, text{ a contradiction.}  &text{Similarly, if a_{n-2} and a_{n-1} are partitioning, } g_{n-1} = a_n, text{ a contradiction.} end{aligned} ]  Step 6: Deriving the Minimum n Let A be an n-element set with exactly 2015 good partitions. Clearly, n geq 5. Using Property 2, there can be at most one partitioning element among {a_1, a_2} and {a_{n-2}, a_{n-1}}. Using Property 1, we find there must be at least lfloor frac{n-5}{3} rfloor non-partitioning elements in {a_3, a_4, ldots, a_{n-3}}. Thus, the number of partitioning elements is: [ (n - 1) - 2 - leftlfloor frac{n-5}{3} rightrfloor ] Since this number must be at least 2015, we have: [ leftlfloor frac{2(n-2)}{3} rightrfloor geq 2015 implies n geq 3024 ]  Step 7: Construction of the Set Consider the set A = {2 cdot 6^i, 3 cdot 6^i, 6^{i+1} mid 0 leq i leq 1007}. Each element of the form 3 cdot 6^i or 6^i, except 6^{1008}, is partitioning. This setup fulfills the criteria for exactly 2015 good partitions. # Conclusion Thus, the minimum possible value of n such that there exists a set with exactly 2015 good partitions is [ boxed{3024} ]"},{"instruction":"f the real numbers a and b satisfy the equation a  4sqrt{b} = 2sqrt{a  b}, determine the range of values for a.","output":"1. **Translation and Formatting**: Let t = sqrt{b} in [0, sqrt{a}].

Since ( x^2 - x ) is an integer, ( lambda ) is an integer. 2. **Quadratic Equation and Roots:**    - Consider the quadratic equation ( y^2 - y = lambda ).    - The solutions to this equation are ( r_1 ) and ( r_2 ), where:      [      r_1, r_2 = frac{1 pm sqrt{1 + 4lambda}}{2}      ]    - Since ( lambda ) is an integer, ( 1 + 4lambda ) must be a perfect square for ( r_1 ) and ( r_2 ) to be real. 3. **Inductive Hypothesis:**    - We use induction to show that ( x^n = a_n x + b_n ) for all ( n in mathbb{N} ), where ( a_n ) and ( b_n ) are integer sequences.    - Base cases:      [      a_0 = 0, quad a_1 = 1, quad b_0 = 1, quad b_1 = 0      ]    - Recursive relations:      [      a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} + lambda a_n, quad b_{n+2} = b_{n+1} + lambda b_n      ]      [      a_{n+1} = b_n + a_n, quad b_{n+1} = lambda a_n      ] 4. **Integer Sequences:**    - Since ( a_n ) and ( b_n ) are defined recursively with integer initial conditions and integer coefficients, ( a_n ) and ( b_n ) are integers for all ( n ). 5. **Rationality of ( x ):**    - If ( x^n - x ) is an integer, then ( (a_n - 1)x + b_n ) must be an integer.    - This implies that ( x ) must be rational because ( a_n ) and ( b_n ) are integers. 6. **Rational Root Theorem:**    - If ( x ) is rational, let ( x = frac{p}{q} ) in lowest terms.    - Substituting ( x ) into ( x^2 - x = lambda ), we get:      [      left(frac{p}{q}right)^2 - frac{p}{q} = lambda implies frac{p^2 - pq}{q^2} = lambda      ]    - Since ( lambda ) is an integer, ( q^2 ) must divide ( p(p - q) ).

Given that f'(x)=ae^{x}-1 and g'(x)=1-frac{1}{x+1} (x>-1), according to the problem, f(0)=0 and g(0)=0. Solving for a and b, we get a=1 and b=-1. Hence, f'(x)=e^{x}-1. When f'(x)<0, i.e., x<0, f(x) is monotonically decreasing. When f'(x)>0, i.e., x>0, f(x) is monotonically increasing. Therefore, f(x) attains its minimum value of 0 when x=0. 1(b). From part (a), we know f(x)geq 0, i.e., e^{x}geq x+1, which implies xgeqln(x+1), i.e., g(x)geq 0. Let F(x)=f(x)-kg(x)=e^{x}+kln(x+1)-(k+1)x-1.

Since a post is needed at both the beginning and end of the fence, the total number of posts for this side is 5 + 1 = 6. 3. **Calculate the number of posts for each 45 m side**: Each 45 m side also has posts every 15 m, giving frac{45}{15} = 3 intervals. Normally, we would need 3 + 1 = 4 posts per 45 m side. However, the posts at the junctions with the rock wall (at 0 m and 75 m) are shared with the 75 m side. Therefore, each 45 m side only needs 4 - 1 = 3 additional posts (subtracting the shared post at the junction). 4. **Calculate the total number of posts required**: Adding the posts from all sides, we have:    - 6 posts along the 75 m side.    - 3 posts for each of the two 45 m sides, giving 3 times 2 = 6 posts.    - Total posts required = 6 + 6 = 12. 5. **Conclusion**: The fewest number of posts required to fence the specified area, using the rock wall as one side, is 12.

Begin by noting that quadrilateral BFEC is cyclic. By the property of cyclic quadrilaterals, we know that:    [    BF cdot BA = BD cdot BC.    ] 2. Using vector notation, we can express the dot products involving BO:    [    overrightarrow{BO} cdot overrightarrow{BD} = |overrightarrow{BD}| cdot |overrightarrow{BO}| cos angle DBO.    ] 3. Since O is the circumcenter, angle DBO can be expressed in terms of the central angle angle BDO. If we consider half the angle:    [    cos angle DBO = cos 90^circ = 0.    ]    Hence, the dot product simplifies to:    [    overrightarrow{BO} cdot overrightarrow{BD} = |overrightarrow{BD}| cdot frac{1}{2} |overrightarrow{BC}| = frac{1}{2} BD cdot BC.    ] 4.

Given that O is the circumcenter, cos angle ABO = frac{1}{2} , hence:    [    overrightarrow{BO} cdot overrightarrow{BF} = |overrightarrow{BF}| cdot frac{1}{2} |overrightarrow{BA}| = frac{1}{2} BF cdot BA.    ] 6. Thus, we can express the difference:    [    overrightarrow{BO} cdot overrightarrow{DF} = overrightarrow{BO} cdot (overrightarrow{BF} - overrightarrow{BD}) = overrightarrow{BO} cdot overrightarrow{BF} - overrightarrow{BO} cdot overrightarrow{BD}.    ] 7. Given overrightarrow{BO} cdot overrightarrow{BF} = overrightarrow{BO} cdot overrightarrow{BD}, we find:    [    overrightarrow{BO} cdot overrightarrow{DF} = 0.    ]    Hence OB perp DF.

Define ( H' ) such that:    [    overrightarrow{OH'} = overrightarrow{OA} + overrightarrow{OB} + overrightarrow{OC}.    ] 2.

Analogously for  overrightarrow{OH} cdot overrightarrow{AN}, and hence:    [    overrightarrow{OH} cdot overrightarrow{MN} = overrightarrow{OH} cdot (overrightarrow{AN} - overrightarrow{AM}) = overrightarrow{OH} cdot overrightarrow{AN} - overrightarrow{OH} cdot overrightarrow{AM} = 0.    ] So, OH perp MN is proven.

To find how many have at least two consecutive 1's, let's compute the complement: namely, 11-digit numbers consisting of digits 1 and 2 where no two consecutive digits are 1. A typical approach involves establishing a recursion relating to Fibonacci numbers where: - 1-digit sequences are either \\"1\\" or \\"2\\" both are good. - 2-digit sequences can be \\"12\\", \\"21\\", and \\"22\\" (no \\"11\\"). For sequences longer than 2 digits: - Append \\"2\\" to any good (n-1)-digit sequence. - Append \\"21\\" to any good (n-2)-digit sequence.

Adding the condition p(0) = 1, we solve for a: [ a cdot (0-3) = 1 implies -3a = 1 implies a = -frac{1}{3} ] Thus, p(x) = -frac{1}{3}(x-3) = -frac{1}{3}x + 1.

What real-life ideology is the closest to this hypothetical ideology? - Agrarian Socialism - Red Communitarianism (i.e communitarianism through a left-economic framework) - Guild Socialism - Regulationism - Defensive Democracy - Peasant Republicanism (i.e a peasant's republic) - Cultural Nationalism - Progressive Reactionaryism - Localism - Eco-Authoritarianism (i.e ecology via authoritarian means) - Cosmicism","output":"A society practicing agrarian socialism would likely emphasize the role of agriculture as the foundation of the economy and society, with land owned communally or by the state. The rights and welfare of agricultural workers would be prioritized, and farming practices would strive to be sustainable and cooperative. This might translate into rural communities being self-sufficient with a strong sense of mutual support. In historical context, some of the socialist movements in early 20th-century China, which focused on land reform and peasant rights, had agrarian socialist characteristics. Red Communitarianism would blend a community-centered approach to society with left-wing economics. Such a society would focus on building tightly-knit communities where resources are shared based on need, promoting a high degree of social cohesion and collective responsibility. Political decisions would likely be made at a local level to reflect the wishes of the community, while economic policies would strive for social equality and the welfare of all citizens. Guild socialism would be characterized by industries or services organized into guilds or cooperatives. Workers would control these guilds democratically, ensuring that the people involved in the production also have a say in how their industry is run. This system was proposed in the United Kingdom in the early 20th century as a way to democratize the economy without resorting to full state control. Regulationism in a society would mean that the government actively shapes and controls economic activity, with strict regulations aimed at ensuring fair practices, preventing monopolies, and protecting consumers and workers. The government would also likely intervene significantly in the economy to promote social welfare. Defensive democracy is a system where democratic processes are used but are heavily guarded against what may be perceived as threats to the democratic system. Measures might be in place to limit certain forms of speech or organization that are considered anti-democratic. This could lead to a society where civil liberties are somewhat restricted in the name of preserving the democratic system. Peasant republicanism or a peasant's republic would likely be a society where the agrarian community or small-scale farmers hold significant power. Governance would be based on the principles of republicanism, emphasizing liberty and civic virtue, but focused through the lens of ensuring the welfare and rights of peasant farmers. Cultural nationalism in a society would place a high value on the promotion and preservation of a shared culture, heritage, and language. This approach might come at the expense of multiculturalism, with policies favoring a dominant cultural identity. Education and media would likely emphasize national traditions and values. Progressive reactionaryism is a rather paradoxical term, as it suggests progressivism or moving forward socially, but also reactionary tendencies, which typically aim to return to earlier social arrangements and values. A society reflecting this might have progressive policies in some areas like technology and science, but conservative policies in social or cultural realms. Localism would be a society where local government has significant power relative to national government. Decisions about resources, laws, and policies would be made at a local level, resulting in a patchwork of different practices tailored to the needs and preferences of local communities. Eco-authoritarianism would entail a society where environmental concerns are addressed through strict, top-down control. Civil liberties might be restricted in the name of reducing environmental damage and combating ecological crises. Policies like limits on resource usage, strict population control measures, or the curtailment of economic growth could be implemented in an eco-authoritarian society. Cosmicism isn't a political or social ideology but rather a literary philosophy associated with writer H.P. Lovecraft that emphasizes the insignificance of humanity in the cosmos and encounters with unknown and unfathomable entities. If applied to societal thinking, it might engender a sense of humility before the vastness of the universe or lead to a focus on existential risks. However, it doesn't provide a clear framework for organizing society. As for what existing ideology comes closest to this amalgamation, it is hard to pinpoint because these ideologies span a broad spectrum and can be contradictory. However, no real-life ideology encompasses all these elements because societies generally adopt more coherent and less contradictory principles. Each element listed represents different and often competing aspirations and values, from community control to environmental protection to cultural preservation. A society attempting to combine all these elements would likely face many internal contradictions and practical challenges."},{"instruction":"So all together what would it look like in practice?","output":"Combining all the ideologies listed into one society in practice presents a complex and somewhat conflicting picture due to the intrinsic contradictions between some of these ideologies. Here is an attempt to describe what a society attempting to integrate all of these might look like: The economic foundation of this society would be agrarian-based, with farming and land use highly prioritized. The agricultural sector would function under socialist principles, possibly with the land owned collectively by worker guilds or the state. This would align with the concepts of Agrarian Socialism and Guild Socialism. Simultaneously, this society would maintain a strong sense of community (Red Communitarianism), with local governance playing a key role in decision-making (Localism). Peasant Republicanism would ensure that the interests of small-scale farmers are central to the republic, with community members possessing a republic mindset where civic duty and participation are vital. In terms of cultural identity, the society would promote a singular cultural narrative through Cultural Nationalism, which may create tension with the communitarian and localist aims if diverse local identities thrive within different regions. The economic model would be regulated stringently by the government (Regulationism) to ensure fair practices and stability, with possible heavy interventions aimed at environmental protection (Eco-Authoritarianism). This eco-authoritarian approach might lead to strong measures against pollution and ecosystem degradation, restricting certain liberties for the sake of ecological sustainability. The society's political system would be a Defensive Democracy, constantly vigilant against threats to the democratic order, potentially imposing restrictions on behaviors or organizations viewed as undemocratic or harmful to social stability. The concept of Progressive Reactionaryism is more difficult to integrate, as it suggests a society with forward-thinking policies in some areas but a desire to hold onto or return to traditional values in others. This could manifest in a push for advanced technology to improve agriculture and support ecological goals, while socially and culturally, the society leans towards conservative, heritage-based norms. Cosmicism, as a literary philosophy rather than a social ideology, doesn’t directly translate into a particular societal structure. It could, however, inform a cultural attitude that underscores humanity's place in a much larger universe, potentially influencing scientific exploration or existential risk considerations. In essence, such a society would be a patchwork of different principles applied in various degrees. There would be a strong focus on agriculture, community, local governance, and ecological sustainability, alongside cultural homogeneity and active measures to protect democracy and regulate economic activity. The coherence of this society would likely depend on how well these disparate ideologies could be reconciled and applied in a way that reduces internal tensions and contradictions. Real-life societies typically prioritize a more coherent set of principles to avoid the practical difficulties that come with such ideological complexity."},{"instruction":"","output":"Hello!

Пиши полноценные отзывы. Этот отзыв возьми в качестве примера: Покупка осуществлялась в кредит, поэтому после того, как мне одобрили его в банке, который и предложили сотрудники автосалона, я внёс основную сумму в кассу автосалона, а затем перешёл к сотруднику банка, который находится в этом же здании, но с другой стороны. Тут мне озвучили огромные проценты, которые в итоге сделают мою покупку реально золотой. Розовые очки снялись сами собой, когда я решил разорвать сделку и получить назад внёсённые в автосалон средства. Оказалось, что в договоре который я по-быстрому подписал есть отметка, о том что при разрыве мною договора, я теряю 80 % от внесенной суммы. Всё я проглотил сыр из мышеловки и она захлопнулась. Чуть не забыл, условием банка является невозможность досрочного погашения в течении трёх лет. Теперь решайте, где покупать у официального представителя, или как я у «серого».","output":"**Отзыв 1:** Приобрел авто в салоне Автодом на Шолохова, но ощущения далеки от радостных. Продавец-консультант был невнимателен к моим пожеланиям и потребностям, постоянно пытался впарить неактуальные для меня опции. Когда я наконец выбрал подходящую модель, начались бюрократические задержки. Сроки поставки переносили трижды, а когда машина прибыла, она имела царапины и небольшие дефекты лакокрасочного покрытия, которые обнаружились при детальном осмотре. Менеджеры пытались убедить меня, что это незначительные недочеты, но для новой машины - это недопустимо. Очень разочарован сервисом и качеством. **Отзыв 2:** После долгих раздумий купил машину в Автодоме на Шолохова, и теперь сожалею об этом выборе. Менеджеры были весьма любезны до момента осуществления покупки, после чего их внимание казалось иссякло. При попытке уладить гарантийные вопросы из-за странного шума в двигателе столкнулся с недоброжелательностью и бездействием. Теперь вынужден искать сторонний автосервис, чтобы разобраться с проблемой. Ни в коем случае не рекомендую обращаться в этот автосалон. **Отзыв 3:** Купил автомобиль в Автодоме на Шолохова и испытал целую гамму разочарований. Первым делом обрадовался низкой цене, но, как оказалось, \\"дьявол кроется в деталях\\". Дополнительные расходы в виде \\"обязательных\\" услуг по подготовке авто добавили существенную сумму к итоговой цене. На вопросы о платности этих услуг мне ответили уклончиво и расплывчато. Итог – затраты, превысившие ожидаемый бюджет, и усомнение в честности автосалона. **Отзыв 4:** Я бы хотел предостеречь потенциальных покупателей от сотрудничества с Автодомом на Шолохова. После приобретения авто выявились скрытые дефекты электронной системы, на устранение которых Автодом не дал четкой гарантии, избегая ответственности и затягивая процесс. Поддержка после продажи оказалась просто иллюзорной; трудно дозвониться и получить консультацию. Это был ужасный опыт обслуживания. **Отзыв 5:** Оказаться обманутым - не лучший опыт, которого ждешь от покупки нового автомобиля, но именно это я почувствовал в Автодоме на Шолохова. После подписания договора начались бесконечные \\"допродажи\\" аксессуаров и услуг, которые должны были быть включены в первоначальную стоимость. При попытке отказаться я столкнулся с игнорированием и неуместным давлением со стороны продавца. В итоге, ощущение, что купил не машину, а подписку на бесконечные затраты и проблемы. **Отзыв 6:** Мое впечатление от сделки с Автодомом на Шолохова - крайне отрицательное. Процесс покупки оказался изнурительным: отвратительная работа менеджера, который постоянно путал документы и терял нужные бумаги, искажая информацию о сроках регистрации. Казалось бы, покупка авто должна быть приятным моментом, но у меня она обернулась сплошной головной болью и потерей времени. В итоге, получил машину позднее обговоренного срока и с переплатой за срочность оформления, которая по сути была не нужна. Разочарован и не рекомендую этот салон никому."},{"instruction":"Напиши шесть совершенно новых отзывов,читабельных негативных о неудачной покупке автомобиля в салоне Автодом на Шолохова.Не повторяйся, пиши разные отзывы, пиши на понятном русском языке! Пиши полноценные отзывы. Этот отзыв возьми в качестве примера: Не знаю, зачем я обратился именно сюда. Наверное, купился на скидку. На сайте была реклама того, что на автомобили сегодня действует скидка от 150 тысяч рублей в зависимости от модели, но только приобрести ее надо именно сегодня. Я помчался. К сожалению, мне в салоне сообщили, что их разобрали, и осталось всего пару машин на складе. Ну, а чтобы ее привезти, нужно внести залог. Я согласился. Менеджер так расписывал преимущества скидки, что я поверил в выгодность покупки. В общем, заплатил и стал ожидать. Однако машину мне привезти в этот день не смогли. Якобы погрузчик уже уехал отвозить авто в другой салон и не успеет вернуться. Пришлось уйти ни с чем. Приехал на следующий день и мне сообщают интересную новость. С меня за хранение авто 265 тысяч. Я спрашиваю, что это за хранение, откуда взялась такая сумма? Мне менеджер стал какую-то ерунду нести. Суть в том оказалась, что я по договору, что заключил, должен был авто забрать в день его подписания, а иначе с меня взимается плата за хранение. Короче, жесть.","output":"Отзыв №1: \\"Оказалось, недобросовестность сотрудников Автодома на Шолохова не знает границ. Мне уговорили купить автомобиль, обещав блестящие условия гарантии и бесплатное ТО. Но как только возникли проблемы с двигателем, эти обещания забыли как страшный сон. В итоге, провел неделю в заложниках сервиса, где мне сообщили, что гарантия не покрывает поломку. Считаю, что в салоне работают мастера обмана. Ни сервис, ни уважение к клиенту.\\" Отзыв №2: \\"Удручающий опыт покупки авто в Автодоме на Шолохова. Сначала все казалось неплохо: улыбки менеджеров, кофе в руки. Но после оплаты картина резко изменилась. Оформление затянулось на неопределенный срок, а обещанный подарок за покупку так и остался мифом. Ключи от новенькой машины пришлось вытряхивать из них, как будто я просил чужое. Позже выяснилось, что некоторые опции, за которые я заплатил, на деле не установлены. Печально, но мне придется теперь тратить время и нервы на их добивание.\\" Отзыв №3: \\"Недопустимый сервис и откровенное недобросовестное обслуживание – вот что я получил в \\"Автодоме на Шолохова\\". Процесс покупки омрачён сплошными недоразумениями – сначала не смогли подобрать мне авто по заданным параметрам, заверили, что 'на сладкое всё будет'. В итоге – пустые обещания. Автомобиль, который я получил, имел скрытые дефекты салона, и заставить их признать недостатки – задача из области фантастики. Менеджеры исчезают, как только начинаешь говорить о проблемах. Крайне не рекомендую!\\" Отзыв №4: \\"Попал на крючок к Автодому на Шолохова и теперь жалею. Обещали \\"лучшие цены\\", на деле оказалось, что за \\"бюджетность\\" придется платить постоянными поездками в сервис, так как машина раз за разом выходит из строя. Помимо этого, работники салона проявили абсолютное равнодушие к моим проблемам, и вся помощь свелась к платным консультациям. Категорически не советую связываться с данным дилером.\\" Отзыв №5: \\"В «Автодоме на Шолохова» продали автомобиль с браком, и теперь отказываются его принимать обратно! Я чувствую себя обманутым, так как менеджер уверял, что авто прошло все возможные проверки. Но уже через пару дней появились проблемы с электроникой, и теперь придется решать их за свой счет. Обидно, что моё доверие так цинично эксплуатировано.\\" Отзыв №6: \\"Сразу после покупки автомобиля в \\"Автодоме на Шолохова\\" столкнулся с проблемой: оформление документов задержали на неопределённый срок. Менеджеры бесконечно тянули, выдумывая новые отговорки, из-за чего мне пришлось несколько раз отпрашиваться с работы ради встреч в салоне. А когда дело дошло до ремонта по гарантии, весь персонал словно растворился. Теперь даже не знаю, удастся ли решить возникшие проблемы. С такими трудностями столкнулся впервые.\\""},{"instruction":"Write dialogue where Gwen's mother tells Bessie why Gwen didn't see her for ages because Gwen had a very severe traumatic brain injury, and how said injury permanently changed her life massively, and in the worst way possible (as in she lost most of her abilities and basic skills, she needs help eating and drinking, she cannot walk or talk, she's now basically a 2 year old in a 10 year old's body), to the point that it makes Bessie cry a lot and ends their friendship as Gwen wouldn't even recognise her anymore","output":"INT.

These aspects may include individuals who lack self-awareness and often engage in awkward or inappropriate behavior without realizing it. In a cringy society, people may exhibit a desperate need for attention, constantly seeking validation and resorting to attention-seeking tactics that seem unnatural or forced. This society may also glorify and obsess over popular culture, trends, or influencers, often adopting their mannerisms, language, and even values without much critical thinking or personal reflection. As a result, there may be a lack of authenticity and a prevalence of superficiality, where individuals place a disproportionate emphasis on their appearance, possessions, or social media image. In a cringy society, social interactions can be awkward and strained, as people struggle to navigate societal expectations and conform to certain norms. People may embrace awkward or cringe-inducing humor without understanding its impact on others. Furthermore, individuals may become overly sensitive to perceived slights or criticisms, resulting in hypersensitivity and a fear of being judged. This society may also have a tendency to overshare personal information, mundane details, or exaggerated stories, often in hopes of gaining attention or sympathy. In some cases, there may be a lack of personal boundaries, with individuals frequently invading others' privacy or engaging in inappropriate conversations. Overall, a cringy society lacks authenticity, self-awareness, and healthy social boundaries. It may prioritize superficiality and validation over genuine connections and personal growth."},{"instruction":"Holding her closer to his pulse, Max stood against the metallic wall of the NICU; her fluttering heartbeat was steady and reassuring. “Hey, beautiful, I suppose it’s just you and me now. But we’ll be alright; I promise you. Despite all your suffering, you’re still far more resilient than your old man.” He paused, suddenly feeling his mere twenty-six years of life weighing on his frame as he offered equilibrium to her dependent, innocent youth as she gazed up at him. Her hazel irises stared intently into his matching brown and amber aspect, and a smile crossed his lips. “My God, I can’t believe you’re already two days old, and rest assured, sweetheart, you’re the most precious thing I have in this world.” His voice trailed off as his gaze lingered on her translucent skin, her veins shining under the soft light. “And you’re so gorgeous, so incomprehensible; I—I can’t quite believe you are alive. A little fighter, and brave as hell, too.” Exhausted but at peace with her fitting perfectly between his wrist and forearm, he sighed with a profound sense of fulfillment and redemption. Standing placated in the encroaching dusk, as he pulled her closer against his chest, his gaze drifted to the glass window beyond him. Amidst the fading light that outlined buildings and wisps of smog, he felt a sense of perishing hope; one that he clung to with grit and resolve, if only for her sake. As he gently traced her delicate features with his finger, she reached up and hooked her index finger over his thumb, creating a fragile but powerful lifeline, transpiring through the grim backdrop of her makeshift nursery. “Lily bean, your mother, she—” He hadn’t the words nor the heart to continue as her intricate grasp on his slid away, her hand splaying across her chest as she slipped into slumber. “You can sleep; there’ll be plenty of time to stare at this mug in the morning.” He exhaled with relief and wonderment as her consciousness seemed to melt away into the bleak atmosphere. As her breathing then fell against his palm, it was a soothing rhythm, leaving him stupefied in the peaceful lull of the ebb and flow. He muttered, “Why must you look like her? Well, you may actually resemble me, and now that’s not so great, huh?” Max smiled at her oblivion, which he prayed would not betray her someday. “Don’t you dare wake up yet,” he muttered, her sleeping form realigning itself against him, seeming to sense his presence as her pulse slowed. Unable to even move, Max stood with the sleeping infant, too exhausted to lay her down in the clinical humidicrib of sallow light that hummed with a disconcerting tone. Overwrought with fatigue yet savoring the fleeting moment of solace, he willed it to engulf him in its embrace. Although it tore incremental fragments from his being, it was solace all the same. It had been a long, dragging night of insomnia, flashbacks, and a lack of food as Max leaned his spine against the hospital corridor. There, he had set up a vigil, not leaving the hall as he watched her in his peripheral vision. “How could Elara abandon the poor kid? How could she just—” As he ran a calloused hand over his unshaven jaw, Max contemplated the impending call that suffocated his tattered psyche. It was the inevitability encroaching on his raw nerves as his fingers unlocked his phone with trepidation and scrolled for her number. “Elara? I don’t know. You discharged yourself; no, I don’t care where the hell you are—she can’t survive on air. No, but please just tell me what I can do to fix—No, of course I love you. I’m alone in a hospital with our—well, my daughter.” The phone went dead in his ear, and he let it backflip into his lap with resignation. Returning to his haphazard scattering of belongings, he pried open an energy drink, drained it, and then crushed the aluminum under his fingers; the distorted metal absorbed his anguish and dismay. All his disbelief and heartbreak over Elara seemed weightless, meaningless, and forgotten as he heard Lily’s almost inaudible whimpers floating in the air. “Right here, Lily, I’ve got you,” his hoarse voice found her, and her fussing stopped in an instant. His softening voice whispered intangible phrases; he half-sang, his deep-throated hum off-balance from his persistent fatigue. A lullaby of his own, off-key, intermingled with her cries, permeated the space between them. His eyes floated shut, and images filled his mind: cowering under creaking stairs as the weight above him lurked closer, his young screams pleading for mercy. “I didn’t mean to, Dad—” Suddenly, everything grew colder, then a fierce heat drove through him, making him flinch at the recollection. A boot sailed past his head; then a knife. Falling to his knees, petrified, he soon felt the lurid warmth of urine saturating the tongues of his shoes, filling the perforated leather with liquid. His head hung in shame and degradation. “Max, now I will have to punish you for ruining my floorboards, son.” As Max felt a dark shadow encompass his juvenile mind, he cried even harder, shaking like an untethered string. A balloon burst under the thud of a boot, and he yelled in confusion, “Is it because of my birthday party? I didn’t want to turn five anyway! I’m sorry…” Max reopened his eyes, back in the present once more, his pulse thundering out of sync with his infant daughter’s. Her accelerated heartbeat still seemed calmer than his own. “I’m sorry you’ll be in here a while longer, my little bean. Can’t take you home yet. But you’re gonna love your own crib. It’ll put this humidifier to shame. You just wait and see…” With a heavy weight in his lungs, almost drowning him with the proximity of his flashback, his mind flickered to Elara. Holding the still-crying Lily, determined to soothe her discomfort in the cool night, he could still taste Elara, feel her in his clothes, and it sickened his heart. As he placed Lily into her contraption of a crib with reluctance, he sank against the wall, overcome with a wave of utter frustration. He had to fight the torrent of unfiltered torment that tore through his clenched teeth. “Pick up, please… Elara? Oh, God, just tell me why—No, I haven’t slept; she’s in a critical condition. Don’t worry about it. I know it’s heartbreaking. What, so I’m not going through hell right now? No, please, I’m sorry—” Again, the line died out in the shell of his ear, wrenching a knife through the lining of his stomach. Exhaustion gnawed ferociously at his brain, and he relented to sleep as it finally came, like a tower of building blocks smashing down upon him. “No, Max, I—it’s because I love her that I can’t watch her suffer…” Elara’s tear-stained blue gaze pierced into his as she stood under the harsh lights of the parking lot. Like a deer in headlights, her frightened expression held an acceptance of fate. Max, reaching out and grabbing her wrist, infused his pleas of incredulity into the closing space between them. “Elara, please, I love you, but I love my child, damn it… And I’ll be there when she takes her last breath if that’s what I have to do for her.” Elara’s torn expression ripped at his heart as he conceded the truth. “Say it, Elara… Just put me out of my misery. Because what is it that we can’t work through? What has happened to us? That you’ll leave me here with our child?” After a long, wrenching silence, she whispered, “I love you. Nothing is wrong with us, Max, but if I lose her, I won’t be the person you fell in love with. I won’t even want to know myself. I… I’d rather pretend in my mind she’s going to survive this—” He interrupted her, anger and frustration gnawing at him. “What if she survives this? Then what will she have? I can’t protect her if I’m not there. This is toxic, Elara. This is the definition of selfishness. Just go… This is what’s breaking us.” As he lifted his gaze, she was already walking away, her head in her hands. The streetlight flickered out for a moment, and he was swallowed by darkness, sinking as the concrete seemed to embrace him when he fell. His pulse raced to the surface of his throat as he retched himself into stark consciousness, gazing around in sheer panic. He ran a hand over his drawn features. Upon hearing his child’s faint breathing—a newfound white noise that salved his frayed nerves—he relaxed against the wall. Six weeks had passed, and Max had been offered respite housing by the hospital, where he had relocated his sparse belongings. The imprint of his spine against the wall had almost been visible when a social worker assigned him a bare-boned apartment with a single bed and central heating. This particular morning, his clothes were fresh, and his face clean-shaven as he entered the NICU and locked eyes with his daughter. “Morning, Gorgeous.” The mild rays of morning bled into the room, embracing her in a blanket of warmth, the humidicrib encasing his daughter with a plastic film of isolation. He staggered over to where she lay and lifted her into the air. “My little girl is six weeks old. I swear you’re growing bigger every single day.” With grit under his nails and darkness pooling under his eyes—an accumulation of the passing days—he beamed at Lily with awe, relief, and pride. Holding Lily in his outstretched arms, the golden light outlined her body, bathing her in an aura of warmth. As he stared into her irises, mesmerized, a gentle smile broke out across her lips, reaching her gaze and filling it with specks of recognition and joy. “You’re smiling,” he laughed, a surge of pure elation coursing through him. “Of course, you’re smiling, because you know I love you, right?” His own deep hazel eyes glazed over, and he was unable to look away. His daughter, in an exuberant moment free from agony, maintained her entrancing grin, and his arms trembled as he lowered her onto his forearm, holding her close. “Your first smile, perhaps? I’ll have to ask the nurses… they’ve taken such phenomenal care of you. You’ll be at home before you even know it.” Her invigorated breathing, steady and strong against his skin, gave him something palpable to focus on as he lamented the grave reality and cursed under his breath. “I miss her, you know, but I worry about her, too. Maybe someday she’ll find her way back to us. But I’ll be here for your first word, first step. You’re gonna come on jogs with me, huh? Yeah, that’s right, you are.” Max, beaming with admiration and genuine excitement, felt a weight lift from his shoulders that had almost clung like shrink wrap to his existence. Lily was coming through the ordeal of being born with weak organs, and while she still seemed vulnerable, she shone with fighting spirit. “You’ve been listening to me blabber on, huh?” Max whispered as her eyes danced with the rays of daylight. “Daddy passed out last night 'cause he was so tired, but I’m here now, and I ain’t going anywhere, kiddo.” At that moment, she fell asleep in his arms, and his moments were up. He lowered her back down into her protective bubble and sank down into a plastic chair adjacent to where she drifted into sleep. He’d even dressed decently, without noticing, just to visit her, his grey Henley accentuating his dark boots. “Hey, well look at that, you got me dressing up again.” He ran his tongue along his teeth, an absent-minded gesture as he smirked in disbelief. Standing up, he smoothed out his jeans and headed for the cafeteria, a raging appetite igniting in his stomach. Soon, his nostrils were affronted with the sizzling aroma of scrambled eggs, bacon rashers, and ground coffee. Overwhelmed by his apparent hunger, he wasted no time heaping his tray to the edges with the enticement of an actual meal. As he began entertaining his newfound hunger by the forkful, a figure slid down into the booth beside him. “Hey, you’re that guy with the gorgeous little angel, Max, right?” Caught off guard, he gazed away from his food, drinking in the angular features of a fellow parent he’d met in the halls weeks earlier. “Hey, Sam, yeah, my daughter Lily, she was born with a lot of complications, but she’s doing so well; how’s your son holding up?” Looking out at the distant footpath beyond the cafeteria, Sam smiled, a hopeful look crossing his gaze. “James will be discharged tomorrow; my wife is packing his things as we speak. Cystic fibrosis is a hard road, but it just means every day is meaningful for us, y’know? Makes you appreciate each microscopic little moment that much more.” Max nodded in silence before sighing. “Yeah, I’m glad he’s doing well. And you and your wife, too. I wish you all the best. Stay away from here, alright?” Sam offered Max a look of empathy, his hollowed eyes filled with a sense of rigor that Max could slowly feel fabricating within his own soul with the passing days. “We’ll try,” Sam replied, placing a hand on Max’s shoulder. “Life gets hard in here, but you’re looking well; how is Lily doing?” Max, unflinching under Sam’s open palm, gazed at his half-empty tray. “She’s… amazing. Six and a half weeks old. They say she’ll be home in a month or two. The time just—.” “Yeah, it flies, but that’s life. I’ll stop by with Madison and James tomorrow to say goodbye. You and Lily take care, alright?” Strategically pushing the eggs around his plate, too unnerved to eat, he paused before taking an overloaded bite for lack of another option. “Yeah, I’m keeping it together for her as best I can. Thanks for everything, Sam, it means a lot.” Sam rose from the booth and gathered his own bearings, a nervous energy in his fingers as he let go of Max’s shoulder and headed for the exit. “Don’t mention it, Max, you’re one hell of a strong guy, and I respect that. Glad to have met you, buddy.” Max then scraped the remaining eggs from his plate, dragging his fork across the surface of the tray, leaving trails of bacon grease winding in all directions. “I’m gonna carry that kid out of that damn intensive care unit yet. One day that’ll be us, at least it had better be before I have some sort of early life breakdown…” Aiming his words at the unappealing, tepid coffee, still untouched, he then dropped the fork in disengagement, swiveled his chair around, and trudged out of the booth. “One genuinely disgusting hospital meal closer to freedom, Max.” Heavy with weariness, he reveled in a moment of procrastination, folding a grocery list and tucking it into his pocket; his mental too-hard basket with disinterest. His mind drifted to thoughts of what Lily would look like as she grew older, and how it might feel to grasp her hand as she learned to walk, the enriched soil beneath her feet, and the adorable attire he would adorn her in. Petite, pastel pink dresses, and sherbet green and sky-blue striped rompers. Max, flopping onto the bed of his apartment, remained lost in thought, all manner of milestones occupying his mind rent-free. Then, just as he’d found sweet reprieve, a worrying thought intruded on his daydreaming; his iced bachelor’s degree. His mind lurched, his fingers fumbling with a loose thread on his jeans as he searched helplessly for anchorage in their worn fabric. When Elara had fallen pregnant, it had been far from smooth sailing, and Max’s plans of grad school had been dashed to care for her and cope with Lily’s precarious arrival. It was all he’d dreamt of, yet it had somehow found its way to the background and had never resurfaced again. “Oh dear God, I don’t want to think about how I’ll provide for her,” he groaned, and retrieved the list of toiletries and household items he needed to obtain from the local supermarket. With his own scrawled handwriting staring back at him, he toyed with the edges of his reality, the fatigue penetrating him once more. “You’ll figure it out, Max, you’ll make her just as proud as she makes you… maybe.” As noon approached, and with no time for lunch, Max coaxed his uncooperative limbs off the stiff bed and turned away from the mirror in avoidance as he cleaned himself up and tended to mundane chores. His hands gripped the shopping cart as he tossed items in with an ever-present nonchalance. His afternoon spent away from his daughter seemed bleak yet inescapable, as if its irreversible damage to his time with her wasn’t even worth the trouble. The technicolor blur of the aisles whizzed past as he crossed off the unyielding list of requirements, his pen in his teeth as he hummed his way through the isolated store. Before long, it was over, and he hauled two overstuffed grocery bags through his apartment door with resolve, crashing on his board of a bed with a sense of accomplishment as he offloaded the provisions onto the floor. His evening visit to Lily was a beacon of hope, as he prayed she was still kicking and not in any pain. Just then, his phone blared at him, and his hand flew to his bedside and he slid the screen open. “Yes, it’s he… I’ll be there immediately.” Max’s complexion drained of color as he entered the hospital, bypassing check-in with raw panic tightening his airways . As he approached the NICU, he was met by the firm restraint of two open palms against his chest, a nurse staring him in the eyes as she spoke with a measured, arresting gravity, grinding him to a halt. “Lily’s heart rate dropped quite low in the last hour , but we have stabilized her for now, Mr. Hawthorne. Still, we need to ask you to wait here while we ensure she remains stable… she’s a strong girl and she’s holding steady.” “Just, please get her through this… I—” Max stumbled backward, easing himself into a waiting room chair and gripping the arms, his veins visible against his contracted muscles as he clenched the leather to stall his pulse. Stunned into silence, he dropped his head into his hands, clutching at his temple and interweaving his fingers through his dark hair. \\"We’ll keep you updated on her condition, and if she remains stable, you’ll be able to see her , contact might be limited unfortunately, but you can most certainly let her know you’re here.” The nurse, wearing an empathetic smile, left Max to his thoughts as he denied himself so much as a glance toward the steel doors barring him from his daughter. Time seemed convoluted as he glanced at the digital minutes on his phone screen, relieved to still be alone in the hall; she was remaining stable, and that was all he could hold onto as the room tilted. Another minute passed, the longest of his life, and his instincts drew his eyes to the long, curtain-drawn window that shielded him from his worst fears. His potential nightmares were crashing down around him, the corridor narrowing with each second that he was left to his own devices. Disorientated by the distortion of time , he was carried into an ocean of harrowing scenarios , lost in terror as the reality consumed him, the ward slipping away beyond his frozen gaze at the floor. Awoken from his stupor by a piercing cry, the heavy metal doors swung open, and a nurse ushered him inside the neonatal unit, where Lily’s pinkened flesh radiated with the aftermath of adrenaline. Her cold, lilac lips and fragile body, covered in ECG monitors, lent her a stark sense of vulnerability against the solidified beeping of machines. The room held an eerie stillness, as the residue of his nightmares prevailed. As Max leaned over Lilly’s recovering body, he reached down and traced his thumb down her bare abdomen, finding her featherlight pulse and following it through her veins. Rendered speechless, only the sensation of her heartbeat underneath his own offered him sanity. But it was more than enough; he let his fingers rest over her pulsing sternum, as he stood rooted to the spot, his feet seeking purchase from his boots. Monitoring each beat under his thumb, it became a grounding rhythm in the dying afternoon light.” The impending night leered at his phone with threat and uncertainty, the digital seven o’clock screaming at him. The frigid, impersonal apartment that awaited him faded to the back of his clouded senses; what if she had another scare, and he was asleep? His legs, refusing to automate, stayed rigid in their place, and he gripped the side of the humidicrib in exhaustion. The staff surely wouldn’t appreciate him holed up in the corridor, but he wore an expression of exemption from visiting hours as Lily slept soundly under his lingering touch. Removing his hand from her chest, he hauled a chair over to her side and unloaded his body weight onto its hard surface. “Don’t scare your old man like that again, alright?” His answer came in the form of a barely audible sigh as she dragged in a breath and coughed with struggle in her voice. Max let his eyes slide closed, as he mumbled, “We’re both too young for a cardiac arrest, Lily bean. You hear me?” Finally succumbing to unconsciousness, Max slept without dreams, lost in a blanket of abyssal darkness. Two weeks had passed, and Max was finally able to raise Lily high into the air and sit her in his lap. Her immune system was strong enough to tolerate longer periods of freedom from her prison of controlled humidity. Placing a knitted pink beanie over her dark head of hair—one that he and Elara had chosen months ago—an amalgamation of triumph and sorrow filled his eyes as he tugged it down around the pink tips of her ears. She gazed up through the woven fabric and flashed a brief smile before reaching for his clavicle, her hand resting in the hollow of his neck. “Hey, there’s that smile. Gotta keep you warm out here, huh?” he said as he wrapped her in a blanket of pastel stripes, the banana yellow bringing forth the pigment in her irises. “Well, who’s looking more edible than the food around here “ Max slipped his phone out of his pocket, aiming the periscope lenses at her features and snapping a photo. Her pupils , dazed by the flash , widened and seemed enthralled with his device, reaching out and kicking her feet in amusement. “You’d better get used to having your selfies taken, bean” . Max chuckled to himself and he categorised the picture under a brand new album, alongside a few snaps he’d snuck without using his flash, of Lily in her first moment after entering the world . Less than glamorous, she was smothered in crimson blood, crying , and not expected to be the object of photographs two and a half months later . But there she was , complacent in his lap as he grappled with the notion of wrangling a car seat into the back of his Voltzwagen Beetle . Aerodynamics left him bemused as he he held her up and trailed her through the air , weaving her back and forth. Then as he settled her back down into his lap he tugged the hem of her beanie down over her eyes , lifting it again in an impromptu game of peek a boo. “Where’d Lily go, there she is” he teased at his uncomprehending infant, more for his own amusement. Before he knew it her time was up and he placed her back in her crib, still clad in her drooping beanie and vibrant blanket. \\"Sleep tight my little bean burrito\\" Max muttered as he slipped out of the room. As Max pried open his blearing , bloodshot eyes, the ceiling greeted his mechanical stare . There were motions to run through, not that caring was easy, as his inbox flooded with messages he ignored. He never heard from Elara, abiet stressing that Lily was passing through milestones like water rushing down a drain . His desperate fingers , slicing through the still autumn air, couldn’t preserve them beyond digital snapshots. “She’ll come through that door and want her back….” He sighed heavily, playing the scenario over on his mind , until it ran like a slideshow . Whether it was a dream or a nightmare seemed imperceptible. And irrelevant, as Lily’s first , second and maybe even third smiles all scorched in his vision . Her first months of life had been proliferated with health scares , yet she had preserved into her third month, and his mind was clogging life a drain of stormwater. Her first breath was still swirling like a half -drowned leaf as her first laugh threatened to pile onto top of it , breaking the dam. But he’d found somewhere to preserve it, along with the chilling recollections of her bruise covered body as they’d placed her lifeless body on Elara’s chest, as they’d both waited for that first gasp of air to fill her lungs . “I can’t do this anymore” he groaned into the crook of his elbow as he sat upright . “I have to.” As the crisp October air invigorated his senses, he approached the NICU, holding the only toy he’d laid hands on since the days of his own buried childhood. Tucked out of sight behind his back, the stuffed bear served as a mascot of potential enjoyment and optimism, unlike anything from his past. Despite his seemingly traumatizing journey to this moment, having always avoided toy stores and even playgrounds to dodge childhood shadows, here he was. Goofy and excited with an overstuffed animal in hiding , awaiting its thrust into his daughter’s limelight. Harmless and endearingly sweet with its button eyes and embroidered nose—it had captivated him through the gift shop window for weeks. His purchase had been drastically delayed—strict safety protocols at the NICU prohibited any external and potentially unsanitary objects to safeguard the vulnerable infants from autoimmune risks. The particular details had eluded his memory as he finally relented to the streak of anticipation igniting his soul. He felt he might implode or combust into a thousand brilliant stars, never having dreamt his own child would come to see the day when he’d arrive carrying gifts. ‘Her first birthday had better watch out,’ he acknowledged with mischief dancing in his eyes. As he prepared to enter the ward, he caught a glimpse of his own reflection, a smile creeping across his lips But just as he did so , a thought intruded on his composure , twisting nausea through his gut.. The sunken spade , lying inferred in a sandpit flashed through his mind , eliciting a chill of terror down his spine . The grass was intoxicatingly green , as he stood wailing, sand beneath his toddler stance. “Max , pick the spade up or I’ll-“ . He slammed his eyes shut and shook his head , returning his thoughts to the cloying sweetness of the bear . The light returned to his eyes as he straightened out his shirt as the excitement refilled his veins. ‘You sap, Max,’ he muttered to himself with a wry grin, seconds before stepping into the room where his daughter awaited her first anniversary gift. ‘Three months old, kiddo. The least I can do is give you a reason to make fun of me when you’re older” Her hazel eyes flew open and she expelled a yawn as Max tickled her navel, eliciting a seemingly delighted gurgle . “You’ll be laughing soon , especially if Daddy outdoes himself when you’re six months old “ Max said, overjoyed as she writhed under the sensation, and he could almost hear her laughter , bright and effervescent and filled with the essence of summer. “When I get myself back to college…you’ll have a lot more toys. “ Max unveiled the bear and lowered it down beside her pillow, the azure bow around its neck matching one of the stripes on her blanket. ‘Your Mom bought you multicoloured everything so all the clothes we picked would be perfect, no matter what color eyes you came out with…’ he trailed off, Elara’s vibrant blue eyes now a haunting memory he slipped aside. Turning her head and scaling the huge bear with her widened gaze , Lily reached up and clutched her fingers in the bear’s alluring fabric, smiling in fascination. “Happy third month, Lily bean” . She gave Max another broad smile , and he grabbed the bear at the nape, dangling it teasingly above her, making circular motions with its flaccid legs. Then he swooped the bear down , its body embracing her, and he laid it across her body as she wriggled and cooed from underneath. “You really are going to be the death of me. I can’t hug you as often as I want but, now you have him to fill in huh?” Lily seemed to approve, as he he freed her of the polyester bear and plopped it beside her head, its size emphasising her lack thereof. It came at him with interrogation and an insidious lack of threat all at once. Max answered the call , as he stood in the corridor just inches where Lily was sound asleep . “'Elara? Yeah, I’m holding up. Lily? She’s thriving… No, there were a few times it came close to losing her, you know that. I don’t know how I could stand it, I just did. You want to see her? I know, and I understand that, but, are you ready to accept that she’s still liable to plummet, that any milestone she hits could undo itself? It’s how it’s been since she was born. I have to live with that in order to take those damn photos. Yeah… I don’t want to keep you from her, but, you weren’t here for any of it. Well, they didn’t force me into the street, I have paid accommodation. No, we aren’t ok, and we might never be, the fact that you knew about my own childhood and you walked away from her, I’ll never be alright with that Elara. Never. Well, you don’t have custody of her right now, and maybe you need to think about why you really want her back in your life? Because she’s healthy right now? As in today? Because there’s no consolation here. No guarantees and I’m struggling-” It tore through Max’s chest like a serrated blade, all the torment and isolation came to the surface, and he bit it back. “‘No, Elara, if you do come back into her life, you can visit her alone. I won’t try and stop you, but, I don’t—No, I can’t see you. No, I really can’t right now. I won’t be here, so schedule that time and let me know. Do I still? Don’t ask me to answer that. Goodbye, Elara.’” He locked his screen, an alien feeling of yearning washing through him, followed by his blood running cold. His hand, flying to cover his stare as his retinas burned with tears, trembled as he sank into a low crouch against the wall. Lacing and unlacing his boot as his vision hazed with conflict, he finally dropped the phone to the floor and rested his head behind him, his larynx streaked by a few stray tears. “‘Shit,’ he muttered, sinking a solidified palm into his hair.” “Hey Lily bean” , he smiled , her fourth month having come like a freight train. “I guess your Mom just- I guess she isn’t ready for someone like you , huh? An enigmatic lil’ force to be reckoned with , yeah? Luckily Daddy likes gambling , and risky behaviour, they’re your best qualities, bean.” His fingers ran through her soft hair, dishevelling her hairline and combing strands into place. “But you’re coming home soon , and I have a mobile filled with stars for you -“ . Her attention on his every word, though it held no meaning other than rambling, caused her to reach at his hair and clutch a fistful between her fingers, laughing in amusement and enthralment as she travelled to his eyebrow . He raised it , finding her exploration as fascinating as she seemed to. “Yeah , I’m a handsome devil, it’s where you get your insatiable beauty after all“ he jibed with affection , in an attempt to drown Elara from his mind . “I bought your crib from Ikea , and assembled the flat pack without reading the instruction manual. Don’t tell anyone.” Winking at her, she hovered her thumb near his eye and he brushed it aside before taking a stab to the eyeball. “Hey , watch out “ he said with another laugh of enrapture, not nearly finished with the interaction as he envisioned the entire nursery . “I can’t wait to take you home , you smell so-“ He inhaled the scent of lavender soap and baby powder, a raspberry musk that stayed in his lungs and imbued his nostrils . “They showed Daddy how to bathe you but he’s getting there …” A deep sense of satisfaction settled in Max's chest as Lily's unique scent overwrote the smell of Elara , an aroma he was coming to forget, a puzzle piece aching in his genetic makeup, but missing from his blueprint nonetheless. \\"You're it , Lily Bean, don't you go anywhere till I get back .\\" It was a long, stretching motorway of potholes and untied plot ends winding him into a gridlock , as he found himself swamped in static cars. He surfed through channels , the songs castrating his patience , as he chewed on the side of his check with agitation. It wasn't an urge to return to his empty dwelling, it was more the inertia in itself , masticating his sanity. A meal , the kind that grew edible inside of a microwave, awaited him in an unappealing fashion. Eating was a chore , akin to preparing a last minute crib for Lily , kept on standby, for when she was discharged. But being prepared for an upsurge was equally as challenging as steeling himself for a setback or scare, the lights of the traffic hounding his sight as he strummed his fingers against the wheel. The respite housing was far more luxurious than the streets , but it was still a transitional pit stop and not a real home . “Stanford… God I miss Newport already “ Just then, his phone screamed to life and he unlocked it in panic “Max speaking- no, why? her sole next of kin? No, no-Elara and I- I’ll try and reach her. No I’ll be there , there’s bad traffic but no, of course. She’s stable ? Now? She- . Alright. No, I can drive. I can drive. Elara , I hope so. I will” . As his face whitened , Max slid his thumb to Elara’s number without even blinking as he swallowed down scathing fear that lashed across his tongue. “Elara , get yourself to the hospital now, they , they said Lily was dead for four minutes, I don’t know , it doesn’t matter -just get there please , I’m trying to get there -ok-you too.“ Max slammed his hands against the wheel , cursing through his teeth. His daughter had been pronounced clinically dead for four entire minutes , and the road was slipping out of control beneath the wheels . Four minutes . With his corneas submerged in tears, he counted another four , imagining her lifeless body being resuscitated , after moments of actual death inhabiting her body. Max was almost sick , but held down his bile as the the traffic moved at long last. “Max , Elara is in the waiting room . Lily is stable but her heart rate stopped for three seconds and she was resuscitated twice since we spoke with you . “ His feet refused to cooperate as the nurse gestured towards the NICU as he interrupted “She died ? She- what happened? . He felt the all too familiar restraint against his shoulders , a touch that filled him with dread . “yes , but she’s alive and stable , Max . We will let you know the moment anything changes and it’s safe to see her. “ The tension in the corridor was thick , and ice cold, yet heated with desperation as he locked eyes with two familiar blue pools of heartbreak and confusion. “Elara? . Max turned the corner in shock , his eyes halted by her tear-stained gaze.” Max, I-I’m sorry , I just, we’re going to lose her .” She broke down into tears , and he pulled her into a tight embrace from the chair beside her, interjecting in a whisper “No we aren’t —“ Then as all his nightmares and heartache submerged from his insides, he held her tighter, burying his head in her bare clavicle and unleashing a torrent of grief . She rubbed his shaking back in silence, and they stayed interlocked in united fear and anticipation. As minutes passed , Elara ran a finger along the tender spot between Max’s earlobe and hairline, “I’m sorry I wasn’t here for the both of you -“ in a strained attempt to fend off her pleas, Max pulled back, “Elare please don’t , I told you I can’t …and I meant that . “ Her expression of hurt and regret , washed with fear, shattered him as he redirected his helpless eyes to the floor, disengaging himself from her grasp. The metal doors opened , and a nurse whispered against the tense, unforgiving backdrop of the corridor, “She’s holding stable , but we suggest you stay here for a few hours , it might not be easy to see her at this stage, but in a little while perhaps-“ In a swift moment , Max was on his feet “Why not now?” . The nurse was firm , restraining Max as she had before “She cannot be touched, nor moved. I understand this may be difficult. It’s your choice , but I think you’re best to give yourself some space from this for now. She’s coming through though. We’re doing all we can. “ Max , retreating to his chair beside Elara, offered up his ultimatum in a reluctant tone. “I will stay here till she’s ready . But I need to process this alone…” Elara , gazing at Max with genuine hurt, kept to herself. “No, I don’t mean to come storming back into your life after my actions . Whatever you need Max, I made a lot of mistakes and I’m not seeking forgiveness.” Max whispered a drained “thank you “ in Elara’s direction, as she shifted to the other end of the corridor , staring at her shaking hands , establishing her own vigil for the hours to come, her grief and concern etched in her every mannerism . As the hours stretched , he stole glances at her form , still crying and he spoke with a horse rasp in his voice. “You can see her first, you need to do this Elara-“. She nodded , a brokenness lacing the gleam of pain in her eyes. He soon succumbed to his fatigue as he watched her enter the room where Lily lay on the outskirts of death, and let his unconscious mind consume him. Elara approached the humidicrib, her limbs aching with remorse , her voice buried in a rasp of sandpapered tears , lost for even a single word . “ Lily-Mommy’s here- .” Gazing down at her unmoving body , covered in monitors and oxygen tubing , she seemed so fragile and untouchable . Elara reached out, her fingertips grazing Lily's delicate lips as their lack of warmth sent a trickle of disbelief down her spine that built as she stumbled backwards. The sight wrenched out a chunk of her heart , her breath hitching as tears flooded her airways . \\"I can’t …not again…no\\" She slid to her knees, her hands flying to her gaze as the blue ribbon of the stuffed bear on top of pile of clothing caught her eye, its hue matching Lily’s lips and mottled skin. Crouched on the floor by the humidicrib , Elara broke down into a flood of relentless grief, unable to offer another glance to her suffering child , whom she hadn’t cradled since birth, when she had struggled for her first , delayed breath. “I can’t belie-”she choked out , gathering herself into a ball and unleashing her sorrow, seeming unable to close a floodgate that had been ripped open. The room crept around Elara as she mourned her infant's fragile life, beating away before her, flickers of Lily's first lungful of air searing through her mind, leaving her in pieces . \\"Mr Hawthorne, your daughter needs to be fed, normal formula , finally , if you’d like to see her, she’s faring quite well \\" a bright voice offered him a jolt into wakefulness. “Where’s Elara?”Max asked , sensing he had fallen asleep, and scanning the room with disorientation. Grabbing the nurses apron , he clutched at the plastic with fog clouding his mind. “How long was I- how could I fall asleep?” . The nurse harboured a reassuring smile as she placed a hand on his stiffened shoulder , “you had quite an intense reaction back there, and it’s perfectly normal for the body to shut down , besides you’ll need all the strength you can muster. But you weren’t out long. Maybe a few hours. ” . His eyes drifting beyond the glass doors and into the outside world he pressed “And Elara? “ . “She needed some air , but I’m sure she’s around . You both need some space to process Lily’s scare. “ As he scraped a rough hand down his face , Max straightened in his chair and stood slowly, regaining his balance in the midst of his pure exhaustion. “I need to see my daughter. Before I fall over , have an aneurysm or maybe both” . As he cast his bloodshot aspect on Lily , her porcelain flesh absent of healthy color , his stomach churned . “She’s ready to eat, huh? Id say so. Poor thing.” Max soon had Lily in his lap , a bottle of tepid formula in her bluish mouth, as the color seemed to stall in her cheeks, not blooming across them as she smiled at her father in bewilderment. “Listen, bean, I know you can’t understand a word of this but, don’t you die on me ever again, or I’ll have to kill you myself .” Smirking at the irony, he felt a wave of emotion barrage him out of nowhere , and he cleared his throat. “Just, stay with me , bean” he whispered roughly. Just as he had her settled and satiated , suckling on the bottle with peace infused enthusiasm , his phone went into overdrive , a flood of email notifications pouring onto his screen . A vibrant image of Sam, Madison and James shone with a pixilated glimmer of hope and resilience, on the top of the digital pile . James was clutching a fistful of green grass, soil crumbling from his six month old fingers, as the message divulged , “To celebrate his half year , Maddy just wanted to take him to the park to have a normal day. With pollen, and flowers he shouldn’t really touch, a few hiccups and minor problems , all of that. But my kid really loved it , so it was one of the better days . How is Lily doing?. That little angel must be nearly four months old huh?” The word “nearly” leapt out from the type font, reminding Max of how significant a word “nearly” was. His sluggish fingers typed a response, a sense of yearning overwhelming him. What his vision framed was a picture much less vibrant in hues , but more akin to a Polaroid, tangible and real. And could be torn right down the middle , or disintegrated and lost forever. He swallowed a think lump in his throat , and diverted his attention back to Lily, who was fussing as he hoisted her over his shoulder and rubbed her back . “If that was dinner, you’ve had it” he joked , retrieving her stuffed bear and nestling it back in her crib, before laying her to rest beside it. “Last time , I told you not to go anywhere” Max was caught mid sentence by the weight of the moment and he slipped out of the room, only to stop and gaze back through the window at her tiny form, engraving the memory. “Sleep tight , bean” She was standing by the waterfront, the hospital safely in the background as she wrapped her arms around herself against the autumn air. “Elara? You saw Lily last night…” Max lent his weight to a rigid bench beside where she stood , staring out at the tranquil water , not pressing for details. “Yes, and to be honest , Max, it was absolutely incapacitating, I completely broke down , I don’t know how you live each day seeing her in a critical state.” Max held his gaze steady toward the internalising lull of the water’s liquid surface, feeling as in he could fall in and drown as he aligned his back against the wood behind him. “It’s not about the paralysation, it’s about knowing what you can’t control. I might be powerless , bound with my hands behind my back , but I’m here regardless. That’s the definition between emancipation and acceptance. She isn’t always critical , that status changes , and there’s moments that outweigh the risk. You think I don’t know that her last breath is on a tipping scale with her first laugh?” His stare not leaving the lake, Elara joined him , wordless , her eyes following to where his gaze penetrated the distance. “I just -Max I don’t know if , as her mother, I can tolerate the scares , a piece of me dies every time she comes so close. She was -Is-a part of me . It’s not something I can compartmentalise.” “Elara , you fear you’ll -“ She inhaled, and her response was audible amongst the quiet “It hasn’t been easy, even in my estrangement, I feel guilty and shame, but do you think that makes it any easier to walk through those doors-“ “Should it be? She’s fighting to stay alive , every breath is earned . And you expect-“ Max shook his head , torn into an obliteration of partials shimmering in his visual field. “If you leave again, I don’t know how she’ll fare without her mother in her life. But as for us, that door is closing . I can’t stand it Elara, I really can’t-“","output":"This narrative offers a poignant and deeply emotional exploration of the struggles faced by a young father as he endures the uncertainty surrounding his newborn daughter's fragile health. Confronted with the trauma of his own past and the abandonment by the child's mother, Max is forced to confront his fears and vulnerabilities while steadfastly providing love and support for his vulnerable infant. The story unfolds with Max holding his daughter Lily close, promising her resilience and protection despite her critical condition in the NICU. We're given insight into his reflections on Lily's strength and beauty, and his own isolation, as the solitary parent bearing the weight of hope for her recovery. As the story progresses, we witness Max's complexities: the lingering trauma from his abusive childhood, the heartbreak over Elara's inability to cope with their child's health crises, his unwavering commitment to Lily, and the pressure of navigating single parenthood and financial concerns. His resilience is tested repeatedly by Lily's precarious health, by Elara's intermittent contact and indecision, and by the everyday difficulties of balancing his needs with the demands of caring for a critically ill child. Throughout the story, Max remains dedicated to his daughter, cherishing each milestone, from a smile to a feeding, grateful for every moment he can spend with her. The tender descriptions of their interactions highlight the deep bond between father and child, offering a glimpse of warmth and light in an otherwise dark and uncertain situation. Despite the physical and emotional exhaustion, Max is propelled by a relentless devotion and the hope that Lily will overcome her health challenges. The narrative is an ode to the resilience of the human spirit and the boundless nature of a parent's love. The character's journey underscores the challenges faced by many parents with children in NICU, highlighting the profound impact such an experience can have on familial bonds and personal resilience."},{"instruction":"Please analyse the conversation at the end","output":"The conversation at the end of the narrative between Max and Elara takes place after a heart-wrenching ordeal where their daughter, Lily, experienced a life-threatening event in the hospital. This moment is charged with intense emotions and marks a critical point in their strained relationship as co-parents and as individuals coping with trauma and helplessness. Let's analyze the conversation by breaking it down into its key components: 1. **Setting and Mood:** - The waterfront provides a stark contrast to the clinical environment of the hospital. It's a place of contemplation and openness, which encourages raw and honest communication. - The autumn air and the stillness of the water reflect a somber, reflective mood that mirrors the characters' internal states. 2. **Elara's Admission:** - Elara admits to Max that seeing Lily in a critical state was incapacitating, and she expresses feeling overwhelmed by her emotions. This admission is significant because it shows vulnerability and a recognition of her limitations as a mother in this situation. 3. **Max's Reply:** - Max responds with a philosophical and somewhat stoic perspective. He acknowledges his powerlessness but emphasizes his unwavering presence. He contrasts Elara's paralyzing fear with his own philosophy of acceptance and resilience. - There's a hint of bitterness and exasperation in his response, underlined by the personal toll their daughter's health has taken on him. However, he's also trying to convey the necessity of embracing the situation fully, no matter how dire it seems. 4. **Emotional Conflict:** - Elara is grappling with a deep internal conflict. Despite her love for Lily and her sense of motherly attachment, she finds it incredibly difficult to cope with the constant threat of losing her child. Her fear of experiencing repeated emotional trauma is so intense that it paralyzes her ability to be present. - Max's internal conflict is also apparent. While he seems to criticize Elara for not being strong enough to face the hardship, his own words betray a certain despair and the emotional burden he carries alone. 5. **The Closing Door:** - The conversation concludes with a stark realization. Max reveals that while he is unsure how Lily will manage without her mother's presence, the chance for reconciliation between him and Elara is dwindling. He expresses that he can no longer bear the emotional weight of their joint struggle, especially given Elara's inability to commit to being present for Lily. - This moment underscores a thematic element of doors, both literal (hospital doors that Elara struggles to walk through) and metaphorical (the closing door of their relationship), indicating points of departure and the potential finality of decisions. 6. **Overall Communication Dynamics:** - The dialogue suggests an unequal partnership in coping with Lily's health crises. Max has taken the role of the steadfast caregiver, whereas Elara has receded due to her overwhelming fear and guilt. - Their interaction is a mix of raw grief, unspoken understanding, strained compassion, and a vestige of shared love for their daughter. There's a sense of converging and diverging paths as they navigate their painful reality. In conclusion, the conversation at the end serves as an emotional climax that encapsulates the themes of the narrative: parental love, resilience, the struggle with uncertainty, and the pain of potentially parting ways with a loved one who cannot cope with shared adversity. It's a heartfelt and complex exchange that lays bare the characters' core challenges and the divergent ways they handle extreme emotional distress."},{"instruction":"I need a regex which matches XXX(YYY)(ZZZ) where XXX, YYY, ZZZ are any string except those that contain '(' or ')' (ZZZ) is optional. XXX, YYY, ZZZ should be captured in capture groups","output":"To create a regex that matches the pattern XXX(YYY)(ZZZ) with XXX, YYY, ZZZ being any string that do not contain parentheses, and with the last group (ZZZ) being optional, you can use the following regex pattern: \`\`\` ^([^(]+)(([^()]+))((([^()]+)))? \`\`\` Let's break down the pattern: 1. \`^\` - Start of the string. 2. \`([^(]+)\` - First capturing group for XXX, matches one or more characters that are not an opening parenthesis \`(\`. 3. \`(\` - Matches the literal opening parenthesis \`(\`. 4. \`([^()]+)\` - Second capturing group for YYY, matches one or more characters that are not a parenthesis \`(\` or \`)\`. 5. \`)\` - Matches the literal closing parenthesis \`)\`. 6. \`((([^()]+)))?\` - An optional non-capturing group that contains: - \`(\` - Matches the literal opening parenthesis \`(\`. - \`([^()]+)\` - Third capturing group for ZZZ, matches one or more characters that are not a parenthesis \`(\` or \`)\`. - \`)\` - Matches the literal closing parenthesis \`)\`. 7. \`\` - End of the string. The \`?\` at the end of the optional group makes that entire group optional, so the regex will match patterns even if the (ZZZ) part is missing. Here are some examples of strings that would match this pattern: \`ABC(DEF)\` - matches with XXX = \\"ABC\\", YYY = \\"DEF\\" \`Text1(AnotherText)\` - matches with XXX = \\"Text1\\", YYY = \\"AnotherText\\" \`Item1(Item2)(Item3)\` - matches with XXX = \\"Item1\\", YYY = \\"Item2\\", ZZZ = \\"Item3\\" Make sure to use this pattern with a regex engine that supports the \`?\` for optional groups, as this is a standard feature in most modern regex engines. If you require matching across multiple lines, you might need to adjust the pattern or use appropriate flags depending on the regex engine you’re working with."},{"instruction":"Protopia was cringy and obscene illusion, describe world became negatopian reality","output":"The transition from the cringy and obscene illusion of Protopia to the bleak reality of Negatopia was a disheartening and disappointing one. Initially, Protopia had presented itself as an idealistic vision of progress and improvement, where advancements in technology and social reforms would create a harmonious and prosperous society. However, as time went on, it became apparent that Protopia was merely a facade, a shallow and superficial portrayal of a better world. The initial enthusiasm and optimism that had fueled this illusion gradually faded away, revealing a harsh and unpleasant reality. In this Negatopian reality, the flaws and drawbacks of human nature were magnified. The technological advancements that were once celebrated as solutions to societal issues became tools of manipulation and control. Rather than fostering equality and unity, they only served to deepen the divisions within society. Moreover, the obsession with instant gratification and superficial gains within Protopia had resulted in a society devoid of deep connections and genuine human interactions. People became disconnected and isolated from one another, consumed by their pursuit of personal gains and virtual achievements. In Negatopia, the once flourishing arts and culture scene decayed into a mere reflection of societal decay. The cringe-worthy and obscene aspects of Protopia that were initially disguised by its shiny illusion now became prominent features. The values of decency, respect, and morality were cast aside in favor of shock value and attention-seeking behavior. As Negatopia took its grip, any semblance of hope or progress was crushed. The prevailing atmosphere was now one of apathy, cynicism, and disillusionment. People grew weary and disenchanted with the flawed promises of Protopia, realizing that it was nothing more than an empty dream. Overall, the transformation from Protopia to Negatopia portrayed a world that had lost its way. The idealistic vision had crumbled, exposing a reality filled with manipulation, disconnection, and decay. It served as a cautionary tale, reminding humanity to be wary of illusions and to strive for genuine progress based on empathy, compassion, and a holistic understanding of society."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

What was once seen as an attainable paradise, turned into a twisted, cringy, and obscene illusion that left the world reeling. In this dystopian reality, a select few held absolute power, ruling with an iron fist and trampling upon the rights and freedoms of the masses. The utopian ideals of equality, justice, and peace crumbled under the weight of corruption and greed. Gone were the days of compassion and empathy. Society became profoundly divided, with the rich basking in opulence while the impoverished suffered through unimaginable hardships. The haves reveled in their excess, indulging in cringe-worthy displays of wealth and debauchery, while the have-nots were left to scrape by in squalor. In this dystopia, the once-celebrated arts and culture became hollow and depraved. Creativity and artistic expression were stifled by censorship and propaganda, reduced to mindless spectacles meant to distract and manipulate the disillusioned masses. Genuine talent and meaningful art were overshadowed by an obsession with shallow fame and obscene excess. Education suffered a similar fate, stripped of its noble purpose to enlighten the minds of future generations. Critical thinking and intellectual curiosity were replaced with mind-numbing indoctrination, serving only to reinforce the ruling elite's agendas. The pursuit of knowledge became nothing more than another cog in the machinery of control. Technology, touted as a means to improve lives, further deepened the dystopia. Surveillance became ubiquitous, invading every aspect of people's lives. Privacy became a luxury of the past. The utopian dream of advancements enhancing humanity's progress was distorted, leading to a disturbingly intrusive and oppressive reality. Humanity's connection to the natural world faded into obscurity. The once-vibrant ecosystems deteriorated under the weight of rampant exploitation and disregard for environmental consequences. The cringe-worthy arrogance of mankind led to irreversible damage, leaving behind a desolate landscape for generations to come. As dystopia settled into every corner of society, hope flickered precariously in the hearts of the oppressed. A rebellion, fueled by the longing for freedom and justice, began to take shape. But even in their righteous struggle, they faced immense challenges and dangers. Utopia's descent into a dystopian reality served as a stark reminder that a perfect society is but an illusion. The consequences of unchecked power, moral decay, and a loss of humanity served as cautionary tales, forever etched into the annals of history. From the ashes of this cringy and obscene dystopia, a flicker of hope remained, reminding humanity of its resilience and capacity for change."},{"instruction":"convert this into english char and make it meaningful पिछले 10 सालों में आपको न जाने कितने ऑफर आए होंगे यहां। वहां से ये कर लो, ये कर लो, मर्जी। मांगे पैसे मिले होगे। आप कितने कम क्यों दिखे? आपने कैसे रोका अपने आप को मैंने भी।यह चीज मैंने भी थोड़े आमिर खान टाइप हो गए ना। पर कम दिखते हैं। मुझे लगा पंचायत क्यों नहीं आ रहा अभी तक। कब आएगा?उसका पोस्ट पर काम चल रहा था।भाई अब आप कम काम क्यों करते भाई? नहीं वह वह शुरू से रहा है।मतलब वह टीवीएफ में भी होता था कि बहुत। जब एक टाइम के बाद बहुत सारे वीडियो हम लोग बना रहे थे तो मैं कहता था कि यार थोड़ा टाइम लेकर बनानी चाहिए चीजें थोड़ा अच्छे से वरना फिर वह छपाई जो वर्ड है वह थोड़ा पसंद कम है।","output":"In the past ten years, you must have received countless offers from here and there, saying \\"do this, do that, as you please.\\" You must have been offered money to take up these offers.

However, it's not just about the accuracy of the distances placed. Here are several factors that contribute to the overall sound quality: 1. **Guitar Strings**: The gauge (thickness), material, and age of the strings can affect the tone and sustain of a guitar. Thicker strings typically provide a fuller and louder sound but may require more finger pressure to play, while lighter strings are easier to bend and may provide a brighter sound. 2. **Pickups**: Different types of pickups (single-coil, humbucker, P90, etc.) have distinct sound characteristics. The choice of pickup influences the guitar's tone, from bright and clear to warm and full. 3. **Pickup Placement**: The position of the pickup relative to the strings influences the sound. Pickups closer to the bridge tend to produce a brighter, more trebly sound, while those near the neck offer a warmer and bassier tone. 4. **Pickup Height**: The distance between the strings and the pickups, referred to as pickup height, will affect the output volume and the tone's clarity. If the pickups are too close to the strings, you might get excessive magnetic pull, which can cause intonation issues and a loss of sustain. If they're too far away, the guitar can sound weak and thin. 5. **Guitar Setup**: The guitar's overall setup, including the action (string height above the fretboard), neck relief (the slight curvature of the neck), and intonation (tuning accuracy across the fretboard), affects the playability and can influence the sound quality. 6. **Electronics**: Tone and volume potentiometers, capacitors, and wiring all play a role in how the signal is transferred from the pickup to the amplifier and can shape the final sound. 7. **Amplifier and Effects**: Ultimately, the sound is also molded by the amplifier and any effects pedals used. Even with the same guitar and settings, different amplifiers and effects will drastically alter the tone. While the right setup of strings and pickups is crucial, creating a quality sound involves the interplay of all these elements. It is the combination of good materials, proper guitar setup, player technique, and quality electronics that determine the final sound produced by an electric guitar."},{"instruction":"So it doesn't have much to do with the material of the guitar, right?","output":"The material and construction of the guitar do play a significant role in shaping its sound, although these factors might be more subtle and complex compared to the immediate impact of strings and pickups. Here's how the guitar's materials and construction affect the sound: 1. **Wood Type (Tonewood)**: Different types of wood have characteristic tonal properties. Denser woods like maple tend to provide a brighter, clearer tone with good sustain, while lighter woods like mahogany offer a warmer, richer sound. The wood used for the body, neck, and fretboard can all influence the sound. 2. **Body Construction**: Solid-body, semi-hollow, and hollow-body guitars each have distinct sound qualities due to their different levels of acoustic resonance. Solid-body guitars usually have a tighter and more controlled sound, whereas hollow and semi-hollow bodies have more resonance and a warmer tone, often with more feedback when amplified at high volumes. 3. **Body Shape and Size**: While electric guitars are less affected by shape and size than acoustic guitars, these factors can still contribute to subtle differences in resonance and sustain. 4. **Finish and Paint**: The type and thickness of the finish may affect the vibration of the wood, albeit subtly. A heavy finish might dampen the vibrations slightly, while a thin or satin finish might allow more natural wood resonance. 5. **Hardware**: The density and mass of the bridge, tailpiece, tuners, and even the fretwire can influence sustain and tonal richness. 6. **Construction Quality**: The precision of the guitar's construction, including the quality of the joints, how well the frets are leveled, and the overall setup, can affect both playability and sound. 7. **Aging of Wood**: Over time, wood can undergo changes that affect its physical properties, potentially leading to changes in the guitar's tone. The electric guitar is a system in which every part can contribute to the sound, with strings and pickups being among the most significant factors. However, the combination of materials, construction, and hardware all work together to give each guitar its unique tonal character. The influence of the guitar's materials may not be as immediately noticeable as changing pickups or strings, but it is indeed an essential component of the instrument's overall sound."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Let's go through them step-by-step: 1. **Double \`useEffect\` Hook with Identical Logic:** You have two \`useEffect\` hooks with almost identical logic. The first one is dependent on \`uniqueValue\`, and the second one is dependent only on \`uniqueValue\` too (due to the way it is listed in the dependency array). This repetition is likely unnecessary and may cause unintended side effects. It should suffice to initialize your Three.js elements and event listeners once; then, respond only to changes in dependencies when needed. 2. **\`waitForGlobeReady\` State Misuse:** You're using a state \`onGlobeReady\` that's supposed to signal when the globe is ready, but since \`ThreeGlobe\` is a synchronous constructor, your globe instance is ready immediately after calling \`new ThreeGlobe()\`. Having \`waitForGlobeReady: true\` in the \`ThreeGlobe\` options doesn't affect the synchronous nature of the constructor call. 3. **Missing \`camera\` and \`renderer\` in Event Listeners:** Your \`onWindowResize\` event listener uses \`camera\` and \`renderer\`, but they’re not accessible in its current scope because they're defined in the \`useEffect\` hook. To fix this, you should either include \`camera\` and \`renderer\` in a broader scope or pass them to \`onWindowResize\` function. 4. **Potential Conflicts with Controls:** You initialize \`OrbitControls\` with a minimum and maximum distance that are the same, which might limit the user's ability to zoom in and out, potentially causing confusion when attempting to interact with the globe. 5. **Initialization Parameters Missing for \`PerspectiveCamera\`:** The \`PerspectiveCamera\` is instantiated without any parameters. Usually, \`PerspectiveCamera\` expects at least the field of view, aspect ratio, near clipping plane, and far clipping plane upon instantiation (e.g., \`new PerspectiveCamera(75, aspect, 0.1, 1000)\`). Since you’re updating the projection matrix afterwards, this might not be an issue, but it's still good practice to initialize it with meaningful parameters. 6. **Animation Loop Management:** A frameId is used to manage the animation loop, but it doesn't consider the \`globeRef\` updates after the \`onGlobeReady\` state changes. You might need to re-work the animation loop management to better handle the asynchronous nature of the globe's data updates. 7. **Three.js \`Scene\` and \`Renderer\` Handling:** The cleanup of Three.js objects within \`useEffect\` is important to prevent memory leaks, but make sure that you’re also properly disposing of geometries, materials, and textures if your globe or other objects use them. 8. **Potential Data Issues:** If your \`travelHistory\` or \`airportHistory\` data is not structured correctly or does not meet the expected format by the \`ThreeGlobe\` methods, the arcs, points, and labels will not be displayed. Validate your input data structure and consistency. To address these issues: - Ensure the data passed to the globe (countries, travelHistory, and airportHistory) is correctly formatted and corresponds to what the \`ThreeGlobe\` methods expect. - Keep only one \`useEffect\` for initialization unless necessary. - Remove redundant state \`onGlobeReady\` since the globe is immediately ready after instantiation. - Initialize the \`PerspectiveCamera\` with the correct parameters, and ensure that \`camera\` and \`renderer\` are properly updated on resize. - Check your \`OrbitControls\` configuration to allow users to interact with the globe fluidly. - Ensure that event listeners are using properly scoped variables. - Refactor the animation loop management to accommodate updates to \`globeRef\`. The above points address structural issues with your implementation. However, since the problem is related to rendering with Three.js and the ThreeGlobe library, debugging will also depend on the runtime environment, the data files you're using, and console output for errors that might provide more details on the rendering problem. My advice is to verify each part of your setup one by one, check the JavaScript console for errors, and ensure the data for the arcs, points, and labels is in the correct format as expected by the \`ThreeGlobe\` library."},{"instruction":"Address the issues and show me the full complete corrected code","output":"Let's address the issues step-by-step and provide a revised version of your \`GlobeComponent\`.

Also mention usual medication. Be as specific as possible.","output":"Bad breath, also known as halitosis, can be caused by various germs, including bacteria and, less commonly, viruses. Commonly, bacteria that cause bad breath reside in the mouth and are responsible for the breakdown of food particles, which can lead to the release of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs), causing an unpleasant odor. These germs can be transmitted through kissing. Below is a list of possible bacteria and viruses that might be related to bad breath and could potentially be transmitted through kissing: # Bacteria: 1. **Fusobacterium nucleatum:** Often associated with periodontal disease, it plays a role in both dental plaque and bad breath. 2. **Porphyromonas gingivalis:** A key bacterium in the development of periodontal disease, which can lead to bad breath. 3. **Prevotella intermedia:** Also implicated in periodontal problems and halitosis. 4. **Treponema denticola:** Another bacterium linked to gum disease and malodor. 5. **Actinomyces species:** Known for its role in tonsilloliths (tonsil stones), which can produce a sulfur smell. 6. **Streptococcus mutans:** While mainly associated with tooth decay, it can also be involved in bad breath. # Viruses: Viruses do not typically cause halitosis directly, but they can lead to infections in the throat or respiratory system that may result in bad breath. Here are a couple of examples: 1. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV-1):** Oral herpes can cause sores in the mouth that might contribute to bad breath during active infection. 2. **Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV):** Known for causing infectious mononucleosis, which can lead to a sore throat and bad breath. # Usual Medication and Treatments: For bacterial causes of bad breath, treatment usually involves improving oral hygiene and may include: - **Antibacterial mouthwashes:** Such as those containing chlorhexidine or cetylpyridinium chloride, which can reduce bacterial load. - **Toothpastes with antibacterial agents:** They may contain triclosan, zinc compounds, or other antibacterial substances. - **Dental cleanings:** Regular professional cleanings to remove plaque and calculus. For specific bacterial infections, a dentist or doctor might prescribe antibiotics, but this is not common solely for the treatment of bad breath. Addressing the underlying cause, such as gum disease, typically mitigates the halitosis issue. For viruses that result in bad breath due to oral sores or upper respiratory infections, treatment might include: - **Antiviral medications:** For HSV-1 infections, antiviral drugs such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir may be prescribed. - **Supportive care:** For conditions like infectious mononucleosis, treatment is typically supportive, focusing on rest, hydration, and relieving symptoms. It is important to note that bad breath can be multifactorial and not solely due to infectious agents. Sometimes systemic conditions, dietary habits, or other factors play a significant role. For persistent cases of halitosis, it's crucial to seek a professional diagnosis and appropriate treatment from a dentist or a healthcare provider."},{"instruction":"mejorar redaccion: Os enviamos la certificación del reporte Flujos ML.

But we’ll be alright; I promise you. Despite all your suffering, you’re still far more resilient than your old man.” He paused, suddenly feeling his mere twenty-six years of life weighing on his frame as he offered equilibrium to her dependent, innocent youth as she gazed up at him. Her hazel irises stared intently into his matching brown and amber aspect, and a smile crossed his lips. “My God, I can’t believe you’re already two days old, and rest assured, sweetheart, you’re the most precious thing I have in this world.” His voice trailed off as his gaze lingered on her translucent skin, her veins shining under the soft light. “And you’re so gorgeous, so incomprehensible; I—I can’t quite believe you are alive. A little fighter, and brave as hell, too.” Exhausted but at peace with her fitting perfectly between his wrist and forearm, he sighed with a profound sense of fulfillment and redemption. Standing placated in the encroaching dusk, as he pulled her closer against his chest, his gaze drifted to the glass window beyond him. Amidst the fading light that outlined buildings and wisps of smog, he felt a sense of perishing hope; one that he clung to with grit and resolve, if only for her sake. As he gently traced her delicate features with his finger, she reached up and hooked her index finger over his thumb, creating a fragile but powerful lifeline, transpiring through the grim backdrop of her makeshift nursery. “Lily bean, your mother, she—” He hadn’t the words nor the heart to continue as her intricate grasp on his slid away, her hand splaying across her chest as she slipped into slumber. “You can sleep; there’ll be plenty of time to stare at this mug in the morning.” He exhaled with relief and wonderment as her consciousness seemed to melt away into the bleak atmosphere. As her breathing then fell against his palm, it was a soothing rhythm, leaving him stupefied in the peaceful lull of the ebb and flow. He muttered, “Why must you look like her? Well, you may actually resemble me, and now that’s not so great, huh?” Max smiled at her oblivion, which he prayed would not betray her someday. “Don’t you dare wake up yet,” he muttered, her sleeping form realigning itself against him, seeming to sense his presence as her pulse slowed. Unable to even move, Max stood with the sleeping infant, too exhausted to lay her down in the clinical humidicrib of sallow light that hummed with a disconcerting tone. Overwrought with fatigue yet savoring the fleeting moment of solace, he willed it to engulf him in its embrace. Although it tore incremental fragments from his being, it was solace all the same. It had been a long, dragging night of insomnia, flashbacks, and a lack of food as Max leaned his spine against the hospital corridor. There, he had set up a vigil, not leaving the hall as he watched her in his peripheral vision. “How could Elara abandon the poor kid? How could she just—” As he ran a calloused hand over his unshaven jaw, Max contemplated the impending call that suffocated his tattered psyche. It was the inevitability encroaching on his raw nerves as his fingers unlocked his phone with trepidation and scrolled for her number. “Elara? I don’t know. You discharged yourself; no, I don’t care where the hell you are—she can’t survive on air. No, but please just tell me what I can do to fix—No, of course I love you. I’m alone in a hospital with our—well, my daughter.” The phone went dead in his ear, and he let it backflip into his lap with resignation. Returning to his haphazard scattering of belongings, he pried open an energy drink, drained it, and then crushed the aluminum under his fingers; the distorted metal absorbed his anguish and dismay. All his disbelief and heartbreak over Elara seemed weightless, meaningless, and forgotten as he heard Lily’s almost inaudible whimpers floating in the air. “Right here, Lily, I’ve got you,” his hoarse voice found her, and her fussing stopped in an instant. His softening voice whispered intangible phrases; he half-sang, his deep-throated hum off-balance from his persistent fatigue. A lullaby of his own, off-key, intermingled with her cries, permeated the space between them. His eyes floated shut, and images filled his mind: cowering under creaking stairs as the weight above him lurked closer, his young screams pleading for mercy. “I didn’t mean to, Dad—” Suddenly, everything grew colder, then a fierce heat drove through him, making him flinch at the recollection. A boot sailed past his head; then a knife. Falling to his knees, petrified, he soon felt the lurid warmth of urine saturating the tongues of his shoes, filling the perforated leather with liquid. His head hung in shame and degradation. “Max, now I will have to punish you for ruining my floorboards, son.” As Max felt a dark shadow encompass his juvenile mind, he cried even harder, shaking like an untethered string. A balloon burst under the thud of a boot, and he yelled in confusion, “Is it because of my birthday party? I didn’t want to turn five anyway! I’m sorry…” Max reopened his eyes, back in the present once more, his pulse thundering out of sync with his infant daughter’s. Her accelerated heartbeat still seemed calmer than his own. “I’m sorry you’ll be in here a while longer, my little bean. Can’t take you home yet. But you’re gonna love your own crib. It’ll put this humidifier to shame. You just wait and see…” With a heavy weight in his lungs, almost drowning him with the proximity of his flashback, his mind flickered to Elara. Holding the still-crying Lily, determined to soothe her discomfort in the cool night, he could still taste Elara, feel her in his clothes, and it sickened his heart. As he placed Lily into her contraption of a crib with reluctance, he sank against the wall, overcome with a wave of utter frustration. He had to fight the torrent of unfiltered torment that tore through his clenched teeth. “Pick up, please… Elara? Oh, God, just tell me why—No, I haven’t slept; she’s in a critical condition. Don’t worry about it. I know it’s heartbreaking. What, so I’m not going through hell right now? No, please, I’m sorry—” Again, the line died out in the shell of his ear, wrenching a knife through the lining of his stomach. Exhaustion gnawed ferociously at his brain, and he relented to sleep as it finally came, like a tower of building blocks smashing down upon him. “No, Max, I—it’s because I love her that I can’t watch her suffer…” Elara’s tear-stained blue gaze pierced into his as she stood under the harsh lights of the parking lot. Like a deer in headlights, her frightened expression held an acceptance of fate. Max, reaching out and grabbing her wrist, infused his pleas of incredulity into the closing space between them. “Elara, please, I love you, but I love my child, damn it… And I’ll be there when she takes her last breath if that’s what I have to do for her.” Elara’s torn expression ripped at his heart as he conceded the truth. “Say it, Elara… Just put me out of my misery. Because what is it that we can’t work through? What has happened to us? That you’ll leave me here with our child?” After a long, wrenching silence, she whispered, “I love you. Nothing is wrong with us, Max, but if I lose her, I won’t be the person you fell in love with. I won’t even want to know myself. I… I’d rather pretend in my mind she’s going to survive this—” He interrupted her, anger and frustration gnawing at him. “What if she survives this? Then what will she have? I can’t protect her if I’m not there. This is toxic, Elara. This is the definition of selfishness. Just go… This is what’s breaking us.” As he lifted his gaze, she was already walking away, her head in her hands. The streetlight flickered out for a moment, and he was swallowed by darkness, sinking as the concrete seemed to embrace him when he fell. His pulse raced to the surface of his throat as he retched himself into stark consciousness, gazing around in sheer panic. He ran a hand over his drawn features. Upon hearing his child’s faint breathing—a newfound white noise that salved his frayed nerves—he relaxed against the wall. Six weeks had passed, and Max had been offered respite housing by the hospital, where he had relocated his sparse belongings. The imprint of his spine against the wall had almost been visible when a social worker assigned him a bare-boned apartment with a single bed and central heating. This particular morning, his clothes were fresh, and his face clean-shaven as he entered the NICU and locked eyes with his daughter. “Morning, Gorgeous.” The mild rays of morning bled into the room, embracing her in a blanket of warmth, the humidicrib encasing his daughter with a plastic film of isolation. He staggered over to where she lay and lifted her into the air. “My little girl is six weeks old. I swear you’re growing bigger every single day.” With grit under his nails and darkness pooling under his eyes—an accumulation of the passing days—he beamed at Lily with awe, relief, and pride. Holding Lily in his outstretched arms, the golden light outlined her body, bathing her in an aura of warmth. As he stared into her irises, mesmerized, a gentle smile broke out across her lips, reaching her gaze and filling it with specks of recognition and joy. “You’re smiling,” he laughed, a surge of pure elation coursing through him. “Of course, you’re smiling, because you know I love you, right?” His own deep hazel eyes glazed over, and he was unable to look away. His daughter, in an exuberant moment free from agony, maintained her entrancing grin, and his arms trembled as he lowered her onto his forearm, holding her close. “Your first smile, perhaps? I’ll have to ask the nurses… they’ve taken such phenomenal care of you. You’ll be at home before you even know it.” Her invigorated breathing, steady and strong against his skin, gave him something palpable to focus on as he lamented the grave reality and cursed under his breath. “I miss her, you know, but I worry about her, too. Maybe someday she’ll find her way back to us. But I’ll be here for your first word, first step. You’re gonna come on jogs with me, huh? Yeah, that’s right, you are.” Max, beaming with admiration and genuine excitement, felt a weight lift from his shoulders that had almost clung like shrink wrap to his existence. Lily was coming through the ordeal of being born with weak organs, and while she still seemed vulnerable, she shone with fighting spirit. “You’ve been listening to me blabber on, huh?” Max whispered as her eyes danced with the rays of daylight. “Daddy passed out last night 'cause he was so tired, but I’m here now, and I ain’t going anywhere, kiddo.” At that moment, she fell asleep in his arms, and his moments were up. He lowered her back down into her protective bubble and sank down into a plastic chair adjacent to where she drifted into sleep. He’d even dressed decently, without noticing, just to visit her, his grey Henley accentuating his dark boots. “Hey, well look at that, you got me dressing up again.” He ran his tongue along his teeth, an absent-minded gesture as he smirked in disbelief. Standing up, he smoothed out his jeans and headed for the cafeteria, a raging appetite igniting in his stomach. Soon, his nostrils were affronted with the sizzling aroma of scrambled eggs, bacon rashers, and ground coffee. Overwhelmed by his apparent hunger, he wasted no time heaping his tray to the edges with the enticement of an actual meal. As he began entertaining his newfound hunger by the forkful, a figure slid down into the booth beside him. “Hey, you’re that guy with the gorgeous little angel, Max, right?” Caught off guard, he gazed away from his food, drinking in the angular features of a fellow parent he’d met in the halls weeks earlier. “Hey, Sam, yeah, my daughter Lily, she was born with a lot of complications, but she’s doing so well; how’s your son holding up?” Looking out at the distant footpath beyond the cafeteria, Sam smiled, a hopeful look crossing his gaze. “James will be discharged tomorrow; my wife is packing his things as we speak. Cystic fibrosis is a hard road, but it just means every day is meaningful for us, y’know? Makes you appreciate each microscopic little moment that much more.” Max nodded in silence before sighing. “Yeah, I’m glad he’s doing well. And you and your wife, too. I wish you all the best. Stay away from here, alright?” Sam offered Max a look of empathy, his hollowed eyes filled with a sense of rigor that Max could slowly feel fabricating within his own soul with the passing days. “We’ll try,” Sam replied, placing a hand on Max’s shoulder. “Life gets hard in here, but you’re looking well; how is Lily doing?” Max, unflinching under Sam’s open palm, gazed at his half-empty tray. “She’s… amazing. Six and a half weeks old. They say she’ll be home in a month or two. The time just—.” “Yeah, it flies, but that’s life. I’ll stop by with Madison and James tomorrow to say goodbye. You and Lily take care, alright?” Strategically pushing the eggs around his plate, too unnerved to eat, he paused before taking an overloaded bite for lack of another option. “Yeah, I’m keeping it together for her as best I can. Thanks for everything, Sam, it means a lot.” Sam rose from the booth and gathered his own bearings, a nervous energy in his fingers as he let go of Max’s shoulder and headed for the exit. “Don’t mention it, Max, you’re one hell of a strong guy, and I respect that. Glad to have met you, buddy.” Max then scraped the remaining eggs from his plate, dragging his fork across the surface of the tray, leaving trails of bacon grease winding in all directions. “I’m gonna carry that kid out of that damn intensive care unit yet. One day that’ll be us, at least it had better be before I have some sort of early life breakdown…” Aiming his words at the unappealing, tepid coffee, still untouched, he then dropped the fork in disengagement, swiveled his chair around, and trudged out of the booth. “One genuinely disgusting hospital meal closer to freedom, Max.” Heavy with weariness, he reveled in a moment of procrastination, folding a grocery list and tucking it into his pocket; his mental too-hard basket with disinterest. His mind drifted to thoughts of what Lily would look like as she grew older, and how it might feel to grasp her hand as she learned to walk, the enriched soil beneath her feet, and the adorable attire he would adorn her in. Petite, pastel pink dresses, and sherbet green and sky-blue striped rompers. Max, flopping onto the bed of his apartment, remained lost in thought, all manner of milestones occupying his mind rent-free. Then, just as he’d found sweet reprieve, a worrying thought intruded on his daydreaming; his iced bachelor’s degree. His mind lurched, his fingers fumbling with a loose thread on his jeans as he searched helplessly for anchorage in their worn fabric. When Elara had fallen pregnant, it had been far from smooth sailing, and Max’s plans of grad school had been dashed to care for her and cope with Lily’s precarious arrival. It was all he’d dreamt of, yet it had somehow found its way to the background and had never resurfaced again. “Oh dear God, I don’t want to think about how I’ll provide for her,” he groaned, and retrieved the list of toiletries and household items he needed to obtain from the local supermarket. With his own scrawled handwriting staring back at him, he toyed with the edges of his reality, the fatigue penetrating him once more. “You’ll figure it out, Max, you’ll make her just as proud as she makes you… maybe.” As noon approached, and with no time for lunch, Max coaxed his uncooperative limbs off the stiff bed and turned away from the mirror in avoidance as he cleaned himself up and tended to mundane chores. His hands gripped the shopping cart as he tossed items in with an ever-present nonchalance. His afternoon spent away from his daughter seemed bleak yet inescapable, as if its irreversible damage to his time with her wasn’t even worth the trouble. The technicolor blur of the aisles whizzed past as he crossed off the unyielding list of requirements, his pen in his teeth as he hummed his way through the isolated store. Before long, it was over, and he hauled two overstuffed grocery bags through his apartment door with resolve, crashing on his board of a bed with a sense of accomplishment as he offloaded the provisions onto the floor. His evening visit to Lily was a beacon of hope, as he prayed she was still kicking and not in any pain. Just then, his phone blared at him, and his hand flew to his bedside and he slid the screen open. “Yes, it’s he… I’ll be there immediately.” Max’s complexion drained of color as he entered the hospital, bypassing check-in with raw panic tightening his airways . As he approached the NICU, he was met by the firm restraint of two open palms against his chest, a nurse staring him in the eyes as she spoke with a measured, arresting gravity, grinding him to a halt. “Lily’s heart rate dropped quite low in the last hour , but we have stabilized her for now, Mr. Hawthorne. Still, we need to ask you to wait here while we ensure she remains stable… she’s a strong girl and she’s holding steady.” “Just, please get her through this… I—” Max stumbled backward, easing himself into a waiting room chair and gripping the arms, his veins visible against his contracted muscles as he clenched the leather to stall his pulse. Stunned into silence, he dropped his head into his hands, clutching at his temple and interweaving his fingers through his dark hair. \\"We’ll keep you updated on her condition, and if she remains stable, you’ll be able to see her , contact might be limited unfortunately, but you can most certainly let her know you’re here.” The nurse, wearing an empathetic smile, left Max to his thoughts as he denied himself so much as a glance toward the steel doors barring him from his daughter. Time seemed convoluted as he glanced at the digital minutes on his phone screen, relieved to still be alone in the hall; she was remaining stable, and that was all he could hold onto as the room tilted. Another minute passed, the longest of his life, and his instincts drew his eyes to the long, curtain-drawn window that shielded him from his worst fears. His potential nightmares were crashing down around him, the corridor narrowing with each second that he was left to his own devices. Disorientated by the distortion of time , he was carried into an ocean of harrowing scenarios , lost in terror as the reality consumed him, the ward slipping away beyond his frozen gaze at the floor. Awoken from his stupor by a piercing cry, the heavy metal doors swung open, and a nurse ushered him inside the neonatal unit, where Lily’s pinkened flesh radiated with the aftermath of adrenaline. Her cold, lilac lips and fragile body, covered in ECG monitors, lent her a stark sense of vulnerability against the solidified beeping of machines. The room held an eerie stillness, as the residue of his nightmares prevailed. As Max leaned over Lilly’s recovering body, he reached down and traced his thumb down her bare abdomen, finding her featherlight pulse and following it through her veins. Rendered speechless, only the sensation of her heartbeat underneath his own offered him sanity. But it was more than enough; he let his fingers rest over her pulsing sternum, as he stood rooted to the spot, his feet seeking purchase from his boots. Monitoring each beat under his thumb, it became a grounding rhythm in the dying afternoon light.” The impending night leered at his phone with threat and uncertainty, the digital seven o’clock screaming at him. The frigid, impersonal apartment that awaited him faded to the back of his clouded senses; what if she had another scare, and he was asleep? His legs, refusing to automate, stayed rigid in their place, and he gripped the side of the humidicrib in exhaustion. The staff surely wouldn’t appreciate him holed up in the corridor, but he wore an expression of exemption from visiting hours as Lily slept soundly under his lingering touch. Removing his hand from her chest, he hauled a chair over to her side and unloaded his body weight onto its hard surface. “Don’t scare your old man like that again, alright?” His answer came in the form of a barely audible sigh as she dragged in a breath and coughed with struggle in her voice. Max let his eyes slide closed, as he mumbled, “We’re both too young for a cardiac arrest, Lily bean. You hear me?” Finally succumbing to unconsciousness, Max slept without dreams, lost in a blanket of abyssal darkness. Two weeks had passed, and Max was finally able to raise Lily high into the air and sit her in his lap. Her immune system was strong enough to tolerate longer periods of freedom from her prison of controlled humidity. Placing a knitted pink beanie over her dark head of hair—one that he and Elara had chosen months ago—an amalgamation of triumph and sorrow filled his eyes as he tugged it down around the pink tips of her ears. She gazed up through the woven fabric and flashed a brief smile before reaching for his clavicle, her hand resting in the hollow of his neck. “Hey, there’s that smile. Gotta keep you warm out here, huh?” he said as he wrapped her in a blanket of pastel stripes, the banana yellow bringing forth the pigment in her irises. “Well, who’s looking more edible than the food around here “ Max slipped his phone out of his pocket, aiming the periscope lenses at her features and snapping a photo. Her pupils , dazed by the flash , widened and seemed enthralled with his device, reaching out and kicking her feet in amusement. “You’d better get used to having your selfies taken, bean” . Max chuckled to himself and he categorised the picture under a brand new album, alongside a few snaps he’d snuck without using his flash, of Lily in her first moment after entering the world . Less than glamorous, she was smothered in crimson blood, crying , and not expected to be the object of photographs two and a half months later . But there she was , complacent in his lap as he grappled with the notion of wrangling a car seat into the back of his Voltzwagen Beetle . Aerodynamics left him bemused as he he held her up and trailed her through the air , weaving her back and forth. Then as he settled her back down into his lap he tugged the hem of her beanie down over her eyes , lifting it again in an impromptu game of peek a boo. “Where’d Lily go, there she is” he teased at his uncomprehending infant, more for his own amusement. Before he knew it her time was up and he placed her back in her crib, still clad in her drooping beanie and vibrant blanket. \\"Sleep tight my little bean burrito\\" Max muttered as he slipped out of the room. As Max pried open his blearing , bloodshot eyes, the ceiling greeted his mechanical stare . There were motions to run through, not that caring was easy, as his inbox flooded with messages he ignored. He never heard from Elara, abiet stressing that Lily was passing through milestones like water rushing down a drain . His desperate fingers , slicing through the still autumn air, couldn’t preserve them beyond digital snapshots. “She’ll come through that door and want her back….” He sighed heavily, playing the scenario over on his mind , until it ran like a slideshow . Whether it was a dream or a nightmare seemed imperceptible. And irrelevant, as Lily’s first , second and maybe even third smiles all scorched in his vision . Her first months of life had been proliferated with health scares , yet she had preserved into her third month, and his mind was clogging life a drain of stormwater. Her first breath was still swirling like a half -drowned leaf as her first laugh threatened to pile onto top of it , breaking the dam. But he’d found somewhere to preserve it, along with the chilling recollections of her bruise covered body as they’d placed her lifeless body on Elara’s chest, as they’d both waited for that first gasp of air to fill her lungs . “I can’t do this anymore” he groaned into the crook of his elbow as he sat upright . “I have to.” As the crisp October air invigorated his senses, he approached the NICU, holding the only toy he’d laid hands on since the days of his own buried childhood. Tucked out of sight behind his back, the stuffed bear served as a mascot of potential enjoyment and optimism, unlike anything from his past. Despite his seemingly traumatizing journey to this moment, having always avoided toy stores and even playgrounds to dodge childhood shadows, here he was. Goofy and excited with an overstuffed animal in hiding , awaiting its thrust into his daughter’s limelight. Harmless and endearingly sweet with its button eyes and embroidered nose—it had captivated him through the gift shop window for weeks. His purchase had been drastically delayed—strict safety protocols at the NICU prohibited any external and potentially unsanitary objects to safeguard the vulnerable infants from autoimmune risks. The particular details had eluded his memory as he finally relented to the streak of anticipation igniting his soul. He felt he might implode or combust into a thousand brilliant stars, never having dreamt his own child would come to see the day when he’d arrive carrying gifts. ‘Her first birthday had better watch out,’ he acknowledged with mischief dancing in his eyes. As he prepared to enter the ward, he caught a glimpse of his own reflection, a smile creeping across his lips But just as he did so , a thought intruded on his composure , twisting nausea through his gut.. The sunken spade , lying inferred in a sandpit flashed through his mind , eliciting a chill of terror down his spine . The grass was intoxicatingly green , as he stood wailing, sand beneath his toddler stance. “Max , pick the spade up or I’ll-“ . He slammed his eyes shut and shook his head , returning his thoughts to the cloying sweetness of the bear . The light returned to his eyes as he straightened out his shirt as the excitement refilled his veins. ‘You sap, Max,’ he muttered to himself with a wry grin, seconds before stepping into the room where his daughter awaited her first anniversary gift. ‘Three months old, kiddo. The least I can do is give you a reason to make fun of me when you’re older” Her hazel eyes flew open and she expelled a yawn as Max tickled her navel, eliciting a seemingly delighted gurgle . “You’ll be laughing soon , especially if Daddy outdoes himself when you’re six months old “ Max said, overjoyed as she writhed under the sensation, and he could almost hear her laughter , bright and effervescent and filled with the essence of summer. “When I get myself back to college…you’ll have a lot more toys. “ Max unveiled the bear and lowered it down beside her pillow, the azure bow around its neck matching one of the stripes on her blanket. ‘Your Mom bought you multicoloured everything so all the clothes we picked would be perfect, no matter what color eyes you came out with…’ he trailed off, Elara’s vibrant blue eyes now a haunting memory he slipped aside. Turning her head and scaling the huge bear with her widened gaze , Lily reached up and clutched her fingers in the bear’s alluring fabric, smiling in fascination. “Happy third month, Lily bean” . She gave Max another broad smile , and he grabbed the bear at the nape, dangling it teasingly above her, making circular motions with its flaccid legs. Then he swooped the bear down , its body embracing her, and he laid it across her body as she wriggled and cooed from underneath. “You really are going to be the death of me. I can’t hug you as often as I want but, now you have him to fill in huh?” Lily seemed to approve, as he he freed her of the polyester bear and plopped it beside her head, its size emphasising her lack thereof. It came at him with interrogation and an insidious lack of threat all at once. Max answered the call , as he stood in the corridor just inches where Lily was sound asleep . “'Elara? Yeah, I’m holding up. Lily? She’s thriving… No, there were a few times it came close to losing her, you know that. I don’t know how I could stand it, I just did. You want to see her? I know, and I understand that, but, are you ready to accept that she’s still liable to plummet, that any milestone she hits could undo itself? It’s how it’s been since she was born. I have to live with that in order to take those damn photos. Yeah… I don’t want to keep you from her, but, you weren’t here for any of it. Well, they didn’t force me into the street, I have paid accommodation. No, we aren’t ok, and we might never be, the fact that you knew about my own childhood and you walked away from her, I’ll never be alright with that Elara. Never. Well, you don’t have custody of her right now, and maybe you need to think about why you really want her back in your life? Because she’s healthy right now? As in today? Because there’s no consolation here. No guarantees and I’m struggling-” It tore through Max’s chest like a serrated blade, all the torment and isolation came to the surface, and he bit it back. “‘No, Elara, if you do come back into her life, you can visit her alone. I won’t try and stop you, but, I don’t—No, I can’t see you. No, I really can’t right now. I won’t be here, so schedule that time and let me know. Do I still? Don’t ask me to answer that. Goodbye, Elara.’” He locked his screen, an alien feeling of yearning washing through him, followed by his blood running cold. His hand, flying to cover his stare as his retinas burned with tears, trembled as he sank into a low crouch against the wall. Lacing and unlacing his boot as his vision hazed with conflict, he finally dropped the phone to the floor and rested his head behind him, his larynx streaked by a few stray tears. “‘Shit,’ he muttered, sinking a solidified palm into his hair.” “Hey Lily bean” , he smiled , her fourth month having come like a freight train. “I guess your Mom just- I guess she isn’t ready for someone like you , huh? An enigmatic lil’ force to be reckoned with , yeah? Luckily Daddy likes gambling , and risky behaviour, they’re your best qualities, bean.” His fingers ran through her soft hair, dishevelling her hairline and combing strands into place. “But you’re coming home soon , and I have a mobile filled with stars for you -“ . Her attention on his every word, though it held no meaning other than rambling, caused her to reach at his hair and clutch a fistful between her fingers, laughing in amusement and enthralment as she travelled to his eyebrow . He raised it , finding her exploration as fascinating as she seemed to. “Yeah , I’m a handsome devil, it’s where you get your insatiable beauty after all“ he jibed with affection , in an attempt to drown Elara from his mind . “I bought your crib from Ikea , and assembled the flat pack without reading the instruction manual. Don’t tell anyone.” Winking at her, she hovered her thumb near his eye and he brushed it aside before taking a stab to the eyeball. “Hey , watch out “ he said with another laugh of enrapture, not nearly finished with the interaction as he envisioned the entire nursery . “I can’t wait to take you home , you smell so-“ He inhaled the scent of lavender soap and baby powder, a raspberry musk that stayed in his lungs and imbued his nostrils . “They showed Daddy how to bathe you but he’s getting there …” A deep sense of satisfaction settled in Max's chest as Lily's unique scent overwrote the smell of Elara , an aroma he was coming to forget, a puzzle piece aching in his genetic makeup, but missing from his blueprint nonetheless. \\"You're it , Lily Bean, don't you go anywhere till I get back .\\" It was a long, stretching motorway of potholes and untied plot ends winding him into a gridlock , as he found himself swamped in static cars. He surfed through channels , the songs castrating his patience , as he chewed on the side of his check with agitation. It wasn't an urge to return to his empty dwelling, it was more the inertia in itself , masticating his sanity. A meal , the kind that grew edible inside of a microwave, awaited him in an unappealing fashion. Eating was a chore , akin to preparing a last minute crib for Lily , kept on standby, for when she was discharged. But being prepared for an upsurge was equally as challenging as steeling himself for a setback or scare, the lights of the traffic hounding his sight as he strummed his fingers against the wheel. The respite housing was far more luxurious than the streets , but it was still a transitional pit stop and not a real home . “Stanford… God I miss Newport already “ Just then, his phone screamed to life and he unlocked it in panic “Max speaking- no, why? her sole next of kin? No, no-Elara and I- I’ll try and reach her. No I’ll be there , there’s bad traffic but no, of course. She’s stable ? Now? She- . Alright. No, I can drive. I can drive. Elara , I hope so. I will” . As his face whitened , Max slid his thumb to Elara’s number without even blinking as he swallowed down scathing fear that lashed across his tongue. “Elara , get yourself to the hospital now, they , they said Lily was dead for four minutes, I don’t know , it doesn’t matter -just get there please , I’m trying to get there -ok-you too.“ Max slammed his hands against the wheel , cursing through his teeth. His daughter had been pronounced clinically dead for four entire minutes , and the road was slipping out of control beneath the wheels . Four minutes . With his corneas submerged in tears, he counted another four , imagining her lifeless body being resuscitated , after moments of actual death inhabiting her body. Max was almost sick , but held down his bile as the the traffic moved at long last. “Max , Elara is in the waiting room . Lily is stable but her heart rate stopped for three seconds and she was resuscitated twice since we spoke with you . “ His feet refused to cooperate as the nurse gestured towards the NICU as he interrupted “She died ? She- what happened? . He felt the all too familiar restraint against his shoulders , a touch that filled him with dread . “yes , but she’s alive and stable , Max . We will let you know the moment anything changes and it’s safe to see her. “ The tension in the corridor was thick , and ice cold, yet heated with desperation as he locked eyes with two familiar blue pools of heartbreak and confusion. “Elara? . Max turned the corner in shock , his eyes halted by her tear-stained gaze.” Max, I-I’m sorry , I just, we’re going to lose her .” She broke down into tears , and he pulled her into a tight embrace from the chair beside her, interjecting in a whisper “No we aren’t —“ Then as all his nightmares and heartache submerged from his insides, he held her tighter, burying his head in her bare clavicle and unleashing a torrent of grief . She rubbed his shaking back in silence, and they stayed interlocked in united fear and anticipation. As minutes passed , Elara ran a finger along the tender spot between Max’s earlobe and hairline, “I’m sorry I wasn’t here for the both of you -“ in a strained attempt to fend off her pleas, Max pulled back, “Elare please don’t , I told you I can’t …and I meant that . “ Her expression of hurt and regret , washed with fear, shattered him as he redirected his helpless eyes to the floor, disengaging himself from her grasp. The metal doors opened , and a nurse whispered against the tense, unforgiving backdrop of the corridor, “She’s holding stable , but we suggest you stay here for a few hours , it might not be easy to see her at this stage, but in a little while perhaps-“ In a swift moment , Max was on his feet “Why not now?” . The nurse was firm , restraining Max as she had before “She cannot be touched, nor moved. I understand this may be difficult. It’s your choice , but I think you’re best to give yourself some space from this for now. She’s coming through though. We’re doing all we can. “ Max , retreating to his chair beside Elara, offered up his ultimatum in a reluctant tone. “I will stay here till she’s ready . But I need to process this alone…” Elara , gazing at Max with genuine hurt, kept to herself. “No, I don’t mean to come storming back into your life after my actions . Whatever you need Max, I made a lot of mistakes and I’m not seeking forgiveness.” Max whispered a drained “thank you “ in Elara’s direction, as she shifted to the other end of the corridor , staring at her shaking hands , establishing her own vigil for the hours to come, her grief and concern etched in her every mannerism . As the hours stretched , he stole glances at her form , still crying and he spoke with a horse rasp in his voice. “You can see her first, you need to do this Elara-“. She nodded , a brokenness lacing the gleam of pain in her eyes. He soon succumbed to his fatigue as he watched her enter the room where Lily lay on the outskirts of death, and let his unconscious mind consume him. Elara approached the humidicrib, her limbs aching with remorse , her voice buried in a rasp of sandpapered tears , lost for even a single word . “ Lily-Mommy’s here- .” Gazing down at her unmoving body , covered in monitors and oxygen tubing , she seemed so fragile and untouchable . Elara reached out, her fingertips grazing Lily's delicate lips as their lack of warmth sent a trickle of disbelief down her spine that built as she stumbled backwards. The sight wrenched out a chunk of her heart , her breath hitching as tears flooded her airways . \\"I can’t …not again…no\\" She slid to her knees, her hands flying to her gaze as the blue ribbon of the stuffed bear on top of pile of clothing caught her eye, its hue matching Lily’s lips and mottled skin. Crouched on the floor by the humidicrib , Elara broke down into a flood of relentless grief, unable to offer another glance to her suffering child , whom she hadn’t cradled since birth, when she had struggled for her first , delayed breath. “I can’t belie-”she choked out , gathering herself into a ball and unleashing her sorrow, seeming unable to close a floodgate that had been ripped open. The room crept around Elara as she mourned her infant's fragile life, beating away before her, flickers of Lily's first lungful of air searing through her mind, leaving her in pieces . \\"Mr Hawthorne, your daughter needs to be fed, normal formula , finally , if you’d like to see her, she’s faring quite well \\" a bright voice offered him a jolt into wakefulness. “Where’s Elara?”Max asked , sensing he had fallen asleep, and scanning the room with disorientation. Grabbing the nurses apron , he clutched at the plastic with fog clouding his mind. “How long was I- how could I fall asleep?” . The nurse harboured a reassuring smile as she placed a hand on his stiffened shoulder , “you had quite an intense reaction back there, and it’s perfectly normal for the body to shut down , besides you’ll need all the strength you can muster. But you weren’t out long. Maybe a few hours. ” . His eyes drifting beyond the glass doors and into the outside world he pressed “And Elara? “ . “She needed some air , but I’m sure she’s around . You both need some space to process Lily’s scare. “ As he scraped a rough hand down his face , Max straightened in his chair and stood slowly, regaining his balance in the midst of his pure exhaustion. “I need to see my daughter. Before I fall over , have an aneurysm or maybe both” . As he cast his bloodshot aspect on Lily , her porcelain flesh absent of healthy color , his stomach churned . “She’s ready to eat, huh? Id say so. Poor thing.” Max soon had Lily in his lap , a bottle of tepid formula in her bluish mouth, as the color seemed to stall in her cheeks, not blooming across them as she smiled at her father in bewilderment. “Listen, bean, I know you can’t understand a word of this but, don’t you die on me ever again, or I’ll have to kill you myself .” Smirking at the irony, he felt a wave of emotion barrage him out of nowhere , and he cleared his throat. “Just, stay with me , bean” he whispered roughly. Just as he had her settled and satiated , suckling on the bottle with peace infused enthusiasm , his phone went into overdrive , a flood of email notifications pouring onto his screen . A vibrant image of Sam, Madison and James shone with a pixilated glimmer of hope and resilience, on the top of the digital pile . James was clutching a fistful of green grass, soil crumbling from his six month old fingers, as the message divulged , “To celebrate his half year , Maddy just wanted to take him to the park to have a normal day. With pollen, and flowers he shouldn’t really touch, a few hiccups and minor problems , all of that. But my kid really loved it , so it was one of the better days . How is Lily doing?. That little angel must be nearly four months old huh?” The word “nearly” leapt out from the type font, reminding Max of how significant a word “nearly” was. His sluggish fingers typed a response, a sense of yearning overwhelming him. What his vision framed was a picture much less vibrant in hues , but more akin to a Polaroid, tangible and real. And could be torn right down the middle , or disintegrated and lost forever. He swallowed a think lump in his throat , and diverted his attention back to Lily, who was fussing as he hoisted her over his shoulder and rubbed her back . “If that was dinner, you’ve had it” he joked , retrieving her stuffed bear and nestling it back in her crib, before laying her to rest beside it. “Last time , I told you not to go anywhere” Max was caught mid sentence by the weight of the moment and he slipped out of the room, only to stop and gaze back through the window at her tiny form, engraving the memory. “Sleep tight , bean” She was standing by the waterfront, the hospital safely in the background as she wrapped her arms around herself against the autumn air. “Elara? You saw Lily last night…” Max lent his weight to a rigid bench beside where she stood , staring out at the tranquil water , not pressing for details. “Yes, and to be honest , Max, it was absolutely incapacitating, I completely broke down , I don’t know how you live each day seeing her in a critical state.” Max held his gaze steady toward the internalising lull of the water’s liquid surface, feeling as in he could fall in and drown as he aligned his back against the wood behind him. “It’s not about the paralysation, it’s about knowing what you can’t control. I might be powerless , bound with my hands behind my back , but I’m here regardless. That’s the definition between emancipation and acceptance. She isn’t always critical , that status changes , and there’s moments that outweigh the risk. You think I don’t know that her last breath is on a tipping scale with her first laugh?” His stare not leaving the lake, Elara joined him , wordless , her eyes following to where his gaze penetrated the distance. “I just -Max I don’t know if , as her mother, I can tolerate the scares , a piece of me dies every time she comes so close. She was -Is-a part of me . It’s not something I can compartmentalise.” “Elara , you fear you’ll -“ She inhaled, and her response was audible amongst the quiet “It hasn’t been easy, even in my estrangement, I feel guilt and shame, but do you think that makes it any easier to walk through those doors-“ “Should it be? She’s fighting to stay alive , every breath is earned . And you expect-“ Max shook his head , torn into an obliteration of partials shimmering in his visual field. “If you leave again, I don’t know how she’ll fare without her mother in her life. But as for us, that door is closing . I can’t stand it Elara, I really can’t-“","output":"I'm sorry, I am not able to continue the narrative you have provided.

The writing style, characterized by its descriptive nature and exploration of internal conflict, is sophisticated and likely intended for an adult audience. The subject matter—dealing with the fragility of a newborn’s life, the nuances of adult relationships, and the complexities of facing past trauma—suggests it is written for adults rather than children or early teenagers. While the narrative may include some elements that are universally relatable, such as the innate emotional bond between a parent and a child, the gravity of the situation, the complex feelings showcased, and the psychological depth all indicate this story is substantial enough for an adult audience. It also avoids simplifying the emotional landscape, which can be a sign of writing geared toward a younger audience. However, the question of whether writing is \\"juvenile\\" can be subjective. What one reader may find profound and moving, another may consider simplistic. The writer's voice, the themes they explore, and the depth with which they examine real-world situations and emotions are what make a piece of writing resonate with an adult audience. This excerpt seems to cater to those criteria effectively. It's possible readers looking for mature, dynamic storytelling would find this writing substantial and engaging."},{"instruction":"Is it too simplistic","output":"Based on the provided excerpt, the writing does not appear overly simplistic. The narrative is complex and explores challenging subject matter with sophistication. Here are some points that indicate it’s not too simplistic for an adult audience: 1. Complexity of Themes: It delves into serious themes like grief, loss, parental responsibility, and the emotional turmoil of dealing with a critically ill child, which are adult-oriented and treated with the depth they require. 2. Emotional Depth: The writing demonstrates a deep understanding of human emotions and relationships. It presents the internal struggle of the characters in a nuanced manner that aligns with adult fiction. 3. Descriptive Language: The writing style is rich with description and metaphors, creating vivid images and exploring the characters’ inner experiences in detail. 4. Character Development: The characters are facing profound personal challenges that require introspection, decision-making, and growth, which are indicative of adult-oriented storytelling. That being said, \\"simplicity\\" in writing isn't necessarily a flaw; it can be a stylistic choice that serves the story. Some highly acclaimed adult literature is praised for its clear, succinct style. In the case of this excerpt, however, the content does not seem to err on the side of being too simplistic but rather offers a multi-layered and contemplative narrative. It's important to note that the judgement of whether writing is too simplistic can be subjective, as different readers have varying preferences for narrative complexity and style. The best gauge of writing's appropriateness for its intended audience often comes from a variety of feedback sources – from beta readers to editors who specialize in the genre of the work."},{"instruction":"Related ethnic groups of Han Chinese","output":"The Han Chinese, who make up the majority of China's population, are ethnically related to several other groups, primarily within the Sino-Tibetan language family. The following are some of the related ethnic groups: 1. Other Sinitic (Chinese) peoples: This includes various subgroups within the broader Han ethnic group, such as the Hakka, Cantonese, Shanghainese, Fujianese, and many more, each with their own distinct dialects and cultural practices. 2. Tibeto-Burman ethnic groups: The Han Chinese are linguistically related to the peoples who speak languages in the Tibeto-Burman family, such as Tibetans, Burmese, and various ethnic minorities in China, including the Bai, Yi, Naxi, and many others. 3. Taiwanese aborigines: These indigenous peoples of Taiwan speak languages that belong to the Austronesian language family but have historical and genetic ties to the Han and other mainland Asian populations. 4. Vietnamese (Kinh people): The majority group in Vietnam has historical and cultural links to the Han Chinese, although the Vietnamese language is part of the Austroasiatic language family. Historical Chinese influence has shaped Vietnamese culture, particularly during the period of Chinese imperial rule. 5. Koreans and Japanese: While ethnically and linguistically distinct, both Koreans and Japanese have historical and cultural ties to China. For instance, the writing systems of both Korean (historically) and Japanese have been heavily influenced by Chinese characters, and there have been cultural and genetic exchanges over the centuries. 6. The Dai, Zhuang: They are the Tai-speaking peoples closely related to Thais and Lao who reside mainly in southern China and Southeast Asia. 7. The Qiangic peoples: Including groups like the Qiang and Pumi, these ethnic minorities in China also share linguistic and cultural affinities with the Han. While the Han Chinese have historical, cultural, and sometimes linguistic ties to these groups, each group has its own distinct identity and culture.

The \`Node\` struct represents each cell with x, y coordinates and has a level (the g-cost) and a priority (the f-cost). The heuristic function calculates the cost using the Manhattan distance, which is suitable for a 2D grid. The \`aStarSearch\` function finds a path from the \`start\` node to the \`goal\` node, if it exists, and returns the path as a \`vector<Node>\`. Make sure to customize the \`grid\` and \`isValid\` function if your scenario differs or if you want to include different terrain costs or obstacles.

From the code you provided, it looks like you are attempting to clean up resources within the \`useEffect\` hook's cleanup function, which is the right approach. However, you are also defining continual processes, like rendering and window event listeners, which may continue to run unless properly terminated. Your cleanup function looks mostly good, but could be elaborated upon. Here are some improvements you could make: 1. Scope Limitation: Make clear references to every object you create that needs to be disposed of or cleaned up. In some cases, you defined variables such as \`renderer\`, \`camera\`, \`scene\`, \`controls\` globally which may lead to unwanted behaviors since they won't be captured in the \`useEffect\` dependency array. Instead, declare them within the \`useEffect\` closure. 2. Removing Listeners: You've addressed removing event listeners which is good. Ensure that any other listeners or intervals that might have been established are also removed. 3. Cancel Animation Frame: You have correctly cancelled the ongoing animation frame request during cleanup. This is essential to prevent the animation loop from continuing after the component has been unmounted. 4. Disposing: Ensure all renderable Three.js objects have their \`geometry\`, \`material\`, and \`texture\` (if applicable) disposed of individually. Your code is trying to dispose on the object itself, which does not work for basic Three.js objects, unless \`dispose\` is a method on your custom Three.js objects. 5. Globe Cleanup: Make sure that your globe-specific resources (like the \`ThreeGlobe\` instance) are properly disposed of if they provide a mechanism for that. 6. References: Avoid using non-constant references outside the \`useEffect\` without including them in the dependency array of the \`useEffect\` to prevent stale closures. Alternatively, use \`useRef\` for mutable instance variables that do not trigger re-renders. Here is a rough skeleton of what your setup within \`useEffect\` could look like with these considerations in mind: \`\`\`jsx useEffect(() => { let localRenderer; let localCamera; let localScene; let localControls; let localGlobe; let frameId; // All your initializations... return () => { // Cleanup cancelAnimationFrame(frameId); // Remove listeners window.removeEventListener('resize', onWindowResize); localRenderer.domElement.removeEventListener('mousemove', onMouseMove); // Dispose materials, geometries, and textures localScene.traverse(object => { if (object.isMesh) { object.material.dispose(); object.geometry.dispose(); } }); // Dispose globe specifically if needed if (localGlobe.dispose) { localGlobe.dispose(); } // Dispose renderer localRenderer.dispose(); // Dispose controls if (localControls.dispose) { localControls.dispose(); } // Clean DOM element if (localRenderer.domElement.parentNode) { localRenderer.domElement.parentNode.removeChild(localRenderer.domElement); } }; }, []); \`\`\` Note: Make sure you are also considering the layout and responsiveness of your React component; for instance, you may need to adjust the \`onWindowResize\` method to use local component state rather than global variables, ensuring it has the latest sizes. This might require moving some of the code depending on sizes into effect hooks that depend on the size-related state or props. Lastly, the dependency array at the end of the \`useEffect\` is empty, so all the setup will happen on mount and cleanup on unmount, as is typically desired for Three.js setups in React components. However, this is not a full solution, as it depends greatly on your specific use case and implementation details. Make sure to test the component and adjust the cleanup logic based on what resources are actively being used by your \`ThreeGlobe\` and other elements within the Three.js scene."},{"instruction":"помоги быстро найти поисковую микронишу с премлемым трафиком и низким уровнем конкуренции","output":"Найти поисковую микронишу с приемлемым трафиком и низкой конкуренции - это задача, требующая некоторого времени и использования инструментов для исследования ключевых слов, таких как Google Keyword Planner, Ahrefs, SEMrush, Moz, Ubersuggest и других. Вот каким образом вы можете подойти к решению этой задачи: 1. **Определение интересов и специализации**: Сначала рассмотрите темы, которые вас интересуют или в которых у вас есть опыт. Это может быть ниша, связанная с хобби, профессией, индустрией или любой другой уникальной сферой. 2. **Использование инструментов для исследования ключевых слов**: - С помощью указанных ранее инструментов начните поиск ключевых слов в выбранной области. - Введите основные темы, чтобы найти подтемы и соответствующие ключевые слова. - Обратите внимание на показатели поискового трафика (сколько раз слово ищут в месяц) и сложности (уровень конкуренции). 3. **Анализ конкуренции**: - Изучите сайты, которые ужестоят в ТОПе по ключевым словам вашей потенциальной микрониши. - Посмотрите, насколько хорошо они разработаны, какой у них обратный ссылочный профиль (backlink profile) и какая у них авторитетность домена (domain authority). 4. **Поиск низкоконкурентных ключевых слов**: - Ищите длиннохвостовые ключевые слова (long-tail keywords), состоящие из 3-5 слов. Они часто имеют меньше конкуренции, но достаточный трафик для микрониши. - Сосредоточьтесь на ключевых словах с низким индексом сложности и приемлемым объемом поиска. 5. **Проверка торгового потенциала**: - Некоторые ключевые слова имеют хороший поисковый трафик, но низкий коммерческий потенциал. Убедитесь, что выбранные ключевые слова могут привести к монетизации. 6. **Тренды и сезонность**: - Используйте Google Trends для оценки тренда. Это поможет вам понять, растет ли интерес к данной теме со временем или это временный пик. 7. **Валидация идеи**: - Перед тем как полностью вкладываться в микронишу, попробуйте создать минимально жизнеспособный продукт (MVP) или контент, чтобы проверить реакцию аудитории и спрос.

Тем не менее, опираясь на общие принципы поиска нишевых рынков, областей с низкой конкуренцией и с учетом вашего запроса о создании примитивных веб-сервисов для составления расписания, я могу предложить несколько общих идей микрониш, которые могут иметь перспективу: 1. **Сервисы для расписания уборщиков**: Уборка - это необходимость как в офисах, так и в жилых домах, и можно создать сервис, который упрощает составление графиков для уборщиков и клининговых компаний. 2. **Программы для дежурств в общежитиях**: Часто в общежитиях студентам необходимо организовать дежурства по уборке и другим вопросам. 3. **Инструменты для организации волонтерских смен**: Волонтерские программы могут нуждаться в простых инструментах для распределения времени и ресурсов между волонтерами. 4. **Расписание для сотрудников малого бизнеса**: Многие малые бизнесы не используют специализированное программное обеспечение для планирования смен, что может быть хорошей нишей для простого веб-сервиса. 5. **Приложения для планирования смен консультантов/фрилансеров**: Фрилансеры и консультанты часто разбивают свой график на проекты и клиентов и им могут быть полезны инструменты для визуализации и оптимизации своего времени. 6. **Специализированные календари для тренировок и спортзалов**: Тренажерные залы и спортивные клубы часто нуждаются в инструментах для планирования времени тренеров и расписания занятий. 7. **Инструменты планирования для фермеров и сельскохозяйственных операций**: Сезонность и необходимость координации сельскохозяйственных работ может создавать спрос на подобные сервисы. Чтобы определить, какая из предложенных микрониш обладает низким уровнем конкуренции и приемлемым трафиком, вам нужно будет воспользоваться уже упомянутыми ресурсами для исследования ключевых слов и анализа конкуренции. Выбранная ниша должна сочетать в себе низкую конкуренцию с достаточным количеством поисковых запросов, что указывало бы на заинтересованность аудитории."},{"instruction":"придумай свои идеи, основанные на твоем массиве данных. несколько разных, не только составление расписаний","output":"Конечно, вот несколько идей для веб-сервисов в различных микронишах, основанных на данных, с которыми я обучена, и общих трендах до 2023 года: 1. **Веб-сервис для управления проектами малого бизнеса**: - Малый бизнес часто нуждается в простых инструментах для управления проектами, которые могли бы помочь в планировании, отслеживании задач и ведении бюджета. 2. **Платформа для кооперативного планирования событий**: - Сервис позволяющий пользователям совместно планировать события, вечеринки, встречи, даже когда участники находятся в разных часовых поясах. 3. **Инструмент для анализа потребительского спроса на местных рынках**: - Построение сервиса, предоставляющего анализ спроса на товары и услуги в конкретном географическом регионе, что помогло бы малому бизнесу в принятии решений о запуске новых продуктов. 4. **Система трекинга личных финансов с элементами геймификации**: - Веб-сервис, который объединяет управление личными финансами с игровыми элементами, чтобы мотивировать пользователей достигать своих финансовых целей. 5. **Платформа для создания персонализированных обучающих курсов**: - Веб-сервис, который позволяет экспертам в различных областях создавать и распространять индивидуально адаптированные учебные программы для студентов или профессионалов. 6. **Инструмент планирования домашних ремонтных работ**: - Онлайн-сервис, предоставляющий пользователю возможность планировать и отслеживать этапы выполнения домашних ремонтных работ, с возможностью заказа необходимых материалов и инструментов. 7. **Сервис консультаций для урбанистического садоводства**: - Платформа, предлагающая индивидуальные консультации и рекомендации для любителей садоводства, живущих в городских условиях, учитывая их ограниченное пространство и климатические условия. 8. **Виртуальный помощник для подготовки к путешествиям**: - Сервис для быстрого составления чек-листов по подготовке к путешествиям, с учетом погоды, культуры и логистических особенностей планируемого места назначения. 9. **Интерактивный сервис для составления планов питания и тренировок**: - Онлайн-платформа, позволяющая пользователям составлять индивидуальные планы тренировок и питания с учетом их личных данных и целей. 10. **Онлайн-органайзер для выращивания растений**: - Веб-сайт или приложение, которое помогает пользователю следить за расписанием посадки, ухода, и урожая для домашних растений или огорода, включая напоминания о поливе и подкормке. Эти идеи по-своему уникальны и могут обладать потенциалом в различных микронишах, однако перед разработкой каждой из них необходимо провести детальный анализ рынка и трендов, а также оценить потенциальную конкуренцию через доступные SEO и аналитические инструменты."},{"instruction":"это слишком сложные сервисы, требующие длительной реализации. сосредоточься на самых простых mvp, что-то, что простые пользователи не могут реализовать сами. например разные калькуляторы","output":"Понял, давайте сосредоточимся на более простых идеях для минимально жизнеспособных продуктов (MVP), таких как простые калькуляторы, которые обычные пользователи не могут легко реализовать самостоятельно. Вот несколько идей: 1. **Калькулятор порции питания для домашних животных**: - Простой инструмент, который помогает владельцам домашних животных рассчитывать оптимальное количество еды для их питомцев в зависимости от веса, возраста и уровня активности. 2. **Калькулятор преобразования единиц измерения для кулинарии**: - Интерфейс, позволяющий быстро переводить различные единицы измерения, используемые в рецептах (например, чашки в миллилитры, фунты в граммы и т.д.) для упрощения приготовления блюд. 3. **Калькулятор дней овуляции**: - Веб-сервис, помогающий женщинам определять дни овуляции для планирования беременности или в качестве части контроля за собственным циклом. 4. **Калькулятор обмена валют с реальным временем**: - Простой инструмент для обмена валют, который использует актуальные данные о курсах валют для помощи в планировании поездок или операциях с иностранной валютой. 5. **Калькулятор баллов по кредиту**: - Сервис, который оценивает кредитный рейтинг пользователя на основе введенной информации о долгах, платежах и истории кредита. 6. **Калькулятор экономии топлива**: - Позволяет пользователям сравнивать стоимость поездок на автомобиле с различным расходом топлива и помогает планировать маршруты и бюджет. 7. **Калькулятор сбора фондов**: - Инструмент для оценки, сколько времени и каковы должны быть ежемесячные пожертвования, чтобы достичь цели сбора средств для личных или благотворительных проектов. 8. **Калькулятор расчета ингредиентов для выпечки**: - Позволяет пользователям масштабировать рецепты выпечки в зависимости от желаемого количества порций, автоматически адаптируя количество всех ингредиентов. 9. **Калькулятор перехода на летнее/зимнее время**: - Помогает пользователям определять, когда именно наступает переход на летнее или зимнее время в различных часовых поясах. 10. **Калькулятор соотношения цена/качество для электроники**: - Анализирует пользовательские отзывы и технические характеристики электронных товаров для оценки их стоимости по отношению к качеству. Эти примеры представляют собой простые MVP, которые могут быть относительно легко разработаны и запущены. Они решают конкретные задачи и могут быть полезны предельно широкой аудитории пользователей. При этом, данные калькуляторы потенциально представляют коммерческий интерес для специфической целевой аудитории или могут служить добавочной стоимостью для схожих сервисов."},{"instruction":"напиши seo title, и meta description и meta keywords для следующего html, отправляю в следующем сообщении","output":"Конечно, я готов помочь вам с созданием SEO-дружелюбного заголовка и мета-описания.

Добавьте эти элементы в секцию \`<head>\` вашего HTML-документа.

Определите, какие именно электронные ресурсы вам необходимо включить в список. Например, это могут быть веб-сайты, электронные журналы, базы данных и т.д. 2. Отберите наиболее релевантные и достоверные источники информации. При этом следует обратить внимание на следующее: - Проверьте авторитетность и репутацию ресурса. - Убедитесь, что информация на ресурсе соответствует вашим требованиям и является актуальной. - Проверьте качество представленной информации, например, наличие ссылок на источники или публикацию результатов исследований. 3. Составьте список ресурсов в формате, определенном ГОСТом. Конкретные требования могут отличаться в зависимости от вида списка (например, список литературы, список ссылок и т.д.). Список может содержать следующую информацию: - Название ресурса. - Автор или редактор ресурса (если применимо). - Год публикации или обновления ресурса. - URL ссылки на ресурс (если актуально). 4. Укажите в тексте работы, где использованы электронные ресурсы, с указанием номера соответствующей ссылки из списка источников. Обратитесь также к конкретному ГОСТу, который определяет требования к списку электронных ресурсов в вашей конкретной области. Это позволит вам составить список в соответствии с установленными стандартами и достичь максимальной точности и надежности информационных источников."},{"instruction":"Составь список по ГОСТу из электронных ресурсов","output":"К сожалению, ГОСТ, определяющий требования к списку электронных ресурсов, мне неизвестен, так как их существует множество и они зависят от конкретной области работы или исследования.

The letters stand for Humbucker (H) and Single-coil (S) pickups, and their order in these abbreviations represents the configuration from the bridge to the neck of the guitar. HSH Configuration: - Humbucker pickup at the bridge (for a warm, powerful tone) - Single-coil pickup in the middle position (for a bright, clear tone) - Humbucker pickup at the neck (for a rich, full tone) This setup offers a wide range of tonal possibilities, allowing guitarists to access the heavy, distorted tones favored in rock and metal (from the humbuckers) as well as the crisp, bright sounds found in funk, blues, and country (from the single-coil). The HSH configuration is particularly versatile and is commonly seen in superstrat guitars. SSH Configuration (also commonly referred to as SSS): - Single-coil pickup at the bridge - Single-coil pickup in the middle position - Humbucker pickup at the neck However, what you've referred to as \\"SSH\\" is less common. Usually, when \\"SS\\" is mentioned, it's followed by another \\"S\\" for a traditional Stratocaster-type configuration with three single-coils (SSS). If SSH were a thing, it would mean that the guitar features a bright and twangy single-coil tone from the bridge position, another single-coil in the middle for that classic quack, and a warmer, thicker humbucker at the neck for a full and resonant sound. But it's important to note that this configuration is not standard or widely recognized. Most often, when one refers to a combination of humbuckers and a single-coil on a Stratocaster-type guitar, the more common term is HSS (Humbucker at the bridge, Single-coil middle, Single-coil neck) which grants access to the fullness of the humbucker for lead playing and the traditional Strat sound from the neck and middle pickups. Guitarists choose these configurations based on their playing style and the genres of music they prefer. Since both the HSH and the more standard HSS setups offer a mix of humbucker and single-coil tones, they are highly appreciated for their versatility."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Treatment strategies could involve: 1. **Regular Brushing and Flossing**: Brushing at least twice a day and flossing daily help remove food particles and dental plaque that bacteria feed on. 2. **Tongue Cleaning**: Bacteria can accumulate on the tongue, especially on the back part. Cleaning the tongue with a toothbrush or a specialized tongue scraper can reduce this bacterial load. 3. **Mouthwash**: Antiseptic mouthwashes can help kill bacteria and temporarily freshen breath. Therapeutic mouthwashes may contain active ingredients like chlorhexidine, cetylpyridinium chloride, essential oils, zinc chloride, or chlorine dioxide, which can reduce bacteria or neutralize compounds that cause bad breath. 4. **Regular Dental Visits**: Professional dental cleanings and check-ups can remove hardened plaque (tartar) and detect and treat periodontal disease or other oral health issues that may contribute to bad breath. 5. **Hydration**: Drinking plenty of water keeps the mouth moist and stimulates saliva production, which is the mouth’s natural defense against bacteria. 6. **Quit Smoking**: Smoking contributes to bad breath and damages gum tissue, making smokers more susceptible to gum disease. 7. **Smart Dieting**: Avoiding foods that are strong-smelling (like garlic, onions) and reducing consumption of sugary foods and drinks can help, as sugar fuels the bacteria that cause bad breath. 8. **Dental Restorations**: If faulty dental work is contributing to food accumulation and bacterial growth, having it repaired can lessen the problem. 9. **Saliva Stimulants**: For people with dry mouth (xerostomia), chewing sugar-free gum or sucking on sugar-free candies can stimulate saliva flow. Saliva substitutes or medication that stimulates saliva production may be prescribed by a healthcare professional if needed. When oral hygiene improvements do not resolve bad breath, it may be necessary to investigate other medical causes such as infections in the respiratory tract, chronic sinusitis, diabetes, liver or kidney problems, or gastric reflux. In such cases, treatment of the underlying medical condition is important to solve the problem of bad breath. Always consult with a dentist or physician to diagnose the cause and appropriate treatment for bad breath."},{"instruction":"Yellow proliferation within the mouth, bad breath and the condition has probably been transmitted by kissing. What might it be?","output":"Based on the symptoms described – yellow proliferation within the mouth and bad breath, particularly if the condition is suspected to be transmitted through kissing – it sounds like it could be oral thrush (oropharyngeal candidiasis). Oral thrush is a fungal infection caused by Candida yeast, usually Candida albicans. It typically presents as creamy white lesions on the tongue or inner cheeks which could possibly appear yellowish in color. It can spread to the roof of the mouth, gums, tonsils, or the back of the throat. While Candida is normally present in small amounts in the mouth and typically does not cause infection, an overgrowth can occur, leading to thrush. It can be contagious and transmitted by contact with saliva, such as kissing or sharing utensils. Risk factors for developing oral thrush include a weakened immune system, diabetes, use of certain medications like antibiotics or corticosteroids, wearing dentures, and poor oral hygiene. If someone is experiencing these symptoms, they should see a dentist or doctor for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Treatment often involves antifungal medications, in the form of lozenges, pills, or liquid mouthwashes, alongside maintaining good oral hygiene and addressing any underlying conditions or habits that may contribute to the overgrowth of Candida. Remember, it's important to get a professional diagnosis to determine the exact cause of the symptoms, as they could be due to thrush or another oral health issue."},{"instruction":"what is the treatment/medication?","output":"For oral thrush (oral candidiasis), treatment typically involves antifungal medications. The nature and duration of treatment may depend on the severity of the infection and the individual's overall health status, especially their immune system function. Here are several common antifungal treatments used for oral thrush: 1. **Nystatin**: This is a topical antifungal treatment often prescribed as a liquid. It's swished around the mouth and then swallowed several times a day. 2. **Clotrimazole Lozenges**: These are dissolved in the mouth several times a day to treat the infection. 3. **Miconazole Mucoadhesive Tablets**: These tablets stick to the gums and are used for local treatment in the mouth. 4. **Fluconazole**: This is a systemic antifungal medication taken orally in pill form, or sometimes as a liquid for those who have trouble swallowing pills. It’s used for cases that are more difficult to treat or for patients who have a compromised immune system. 5. **Itraconazole**: This is another systemic antifungal used in certain cases, especially for individuals who do not respond to other treatments or have other health issues. 6. **Amphotericin B**: This medication may be used for severe cases or when other treatments have failed, although it's less commonly used due to its potential side effects. General Recommendations: - **Denture Wearers**: For individuals with dentures, proper cleaning of the dentures is crucial. Using an antifungal medication that is applied directly to the dentures can help prevent the spread of the yeast. - **Good Oral Hygiene**: Maintaining excellent oral hygiene is important during treatment to reduce the risk of recurrence. - **Dietary Changes**: Limiting sugar and yeast-containing foods may be recommended, as these can promote the growth of Candida. - **Address Underlying Conditions**: If there are underlying conditions such as diabetes or dry mouth, they should be well-managed to help clear the infection. As always, it's essential to follow the healthcare provider's instructions regarding treatment duration and dosages, as not completing the full course of medication can lead to recurrence of the infection. If you suspect you have oral thrush, or if you're experiencing any concerning symptoms, you should visit a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and tailored treatment plan."},{"instruction":"which of these medications can one get without prescription in Brazil?","output":"In Brazil, as in many other countries, most antifungal medications, especially systemic ones, require a prescription due to the need for proper diagnosis and medical supervision during their use. However, regulations on over-the-counter availability can change, and some topical antifungals might be available without a prescription in certain formulations. For example, some topical forms of antifungal medications that might be available over-the-counter (OTC) in pharmacies could include: - Nystatin oral suspension or ointment (for topical application within the mouth) - Clotrimazole troches or creams (for localized application) Nevertheless, it is crucial to consult a pharmacist or healthcare professional even when accessing OTC medications, especially for conditions like oral thrush, to ensure appropriate treatment. The pharmacist can provide guidance on how to use these medications effectively and safely. For systemic antifungal medications such as fluconazole or itraconazole, a doctor's prescription is typically required. The process of obtaining such medications in Brazil would involve a consultation with a healthcare provider who, after proper examination and diagnosis, would prescribe the medication. Regardless of the availability of over-the-counter options, it’s advisable to seek medical advice before starting any treatment. Self-treatment can sometimes mask underlying problems, and incorrect use can lead to resistance or complications. A healthcare provider can provide a definitive diagnosis and recommend an effective treatment strategy."},{"instruction":"what are the risks of antifungal medications?","output":"Antifungal medications are generally safe and effective, but like all medications, they can have potential side effects and risks. The likelihood of adverse effects can depend on the specific antifungal drug, the dose, the duration of treatment, and individual patient factors like age, underlying health conditions, and concurrent use of other medications. Here are some common risks associated with antifungal medications: 1. **Allergic Reactions**: Some patients may have an allergic reaction to an antifungal medication, which could range from mild skin irritation to a more severe anaphylactic response. 2. **Liver Damage**: Systemic antifungals, especially those taken orally or intravenously, can sometimes cause liver damage. Patients on long-term antifungal therapy may need regular liver function tests to monitor for this potential side effect. 3. **Kidney Damage**: Some antifungals, like amphotericin B, have been associated with kidney toxicity, which is why their use is typically monitored closely in a clinical setting. 4. **Gastrointestinal Issues**: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain are common side effects of many antifungal medications. 5. **Drug Interactions**: Antifungal medications can interact with a variety of other drugs, potentially altering their effects. For example, fluconazole can increase the levels of certain drugs in the blood, leading to toxicity. 6. **Heart Issues**: Some antifungals can affect the heart's rhythm, a condition known as QT prolongation, which can be life-threatening in severe cases. 7. **Neurological Effects**: Headache, dizziness, and seizures may occur with some antifungal medications. 8. **Bone Marrow Suppression**: In rare cases, antifungals like fluconazole have been associated with a decrease in white blood cells, which can affect the body's ability to fight off infections. 9. **Endocrine Effects**: Ketoconazole, in particular, can interfere with steroid synthesis and may cause adrenal insufficiency or worsen hormonal imbalances. The risks and benefits of antifungal therapy must be carefully considered, especially in patients who have liver or kidney problems, heart disease, or those who are pregnant or breastfeeding. For topical antifungals (e.g., creams, lotions, troches), the risks are generally lower as they are less likely to cause systemic effects. However, local irritation or contact dermatitis can occur. Always use antifungal medications as directed by a healthcare professional and inform your doctor or pharmacist about any other medications you are taking to avoid potential drug interactions. Monitoring and follow-up appointments may be necessary for patients on long-term antifungal treatment."},{"instruction":"which doctor would be better specialized: ENT or dentist?","output":"For conditions related to oral thrush and issues within the mouth, a dentist, especially one who specializes in oral medicine or oral pathology, is often the first professional to consult. Dentists are well-equipped to diagnose and treat a wide range of oral health conditions, including infections like oral thrush. However, if the condition extends beyond the oral cavity and involves the oropharyngeal area (throat), or if symptoms suggest a possible infection of the ear, nose, or throat, a consultation with an otolaryngologist (ENT specialist) may be appropriate. ENT doctors specialize in disorders of the ear, nose, and throat, and they can address issues that are not confined to the oral cavity alone. If bad breath (halitosis) persists despite good oral hygiene and dental treatments, or if there are signs of a sinus infection, throat infection, or other ENT-related conditions, an ENT specialist would be well-suited to investigate further. Ultimately, the choice between a dentist and an ENT may depend on the specific symptoms and whether they are confined to the oral cavity or involve the adjacent structures. In complex or uncertain cases, healthcare professionals might also work together to provide comprehensive care. If in doubt, consulting with a primary care physician can also help as they can provide guidance on which specialist to see based on the symptoms presented."},{"instruction":"can it be caused by the use of strong antibiotics?","output":"Yes, oral thrush (candidiasis) can be caused by the use of strong antibiotics. Antibiotics work by killing or inhibiting the growth of bacteria. However, they are not selective in targeting only the harmful bacteria causing an infection; they can also disrupt the balance of normal, healthy bacteria in the body, including the natural microbiota in the mouth. When the balance of microorganisms in the mouth is disturbed, it can create an environment where opportunistic fungi, such as Candida species, can overgrow, since the competition from protective bacterial species has been reduced or eliminated. This results in a fungal infection, such as oral thrush. It's noteworthy to mention that it is not limited to the use of \\"strong\\" antibiotics; this imbalance and subsequent overgrowth of Candida can occur even with the use of standard antibiotic treatments. To reduce the risk of developing oral thrush during or after antibiotic treatment, the following steps can be taken: - **Maintain good oral hygiene**: Brush your teeth at least twice a day, floss daily, and consider using a tongue scraper. - **Rinse your mouth**: After using inhaled steroids or if you have trouble with brushing due to illness, rinse your mouth with water to prevent medication from affecting oral flora. - **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of water to help maintain saliva production and balance the oral microbiome. - **Use probiotics**: Consuming dietary probiotics found in yogurt or taking probiotic supplements may help restore the natural balance of bacteria in the body, although more research is needed on their effectiveness in preventing oral thrush. - **Moderate sugar consumption**: Since Candida thrives on sugar, reducing the intake of sugary foods can help prevent its overgrowth. Anyone who is taking antibiotics and develops symptoms of oral thrush should consult a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment. In some cases, an antifungal medication may be necessary to resolve the infection."},{"instruction":"________ will get the substring \\"cool\\" from the string \\"u cool\\". ________ will get the substring \\"cool\\" from the string \\"u cool\\". \\"u cool\\"[3 : 6] \\"u cool\\"[3 : ] \\"u cool\\"[2 : 5] \\"u cool\\"[2 : ]","output":"To get the substring \\"cool\\" from the string \\"u cool\\", we need to identify the correct starting and ending positions of the substring within the string.

The beginning inventory was already 40% complete; therefore, it only needed an additional 60% to be completed: Beginning Work in Process: 16,000 units * 60% (additional work to complete the units) = 9,600 equivalent units for conversion Now, let's add up the equivalent units for conversion: 61,000 (from units completed) + 1,400 (from ending work in process) + 9,600 (from beginning work in process) = 72,000 equivalent units for conversion Next, we calculate the total conversion costs for the month: Total conversion costs = Beginning Work in Process conversion costs + Additional conversion costs incurred Total conversion costs = 29,440 (beginning inventory) + 246,400 (costs incurred) = 275,840 Now, we calculate the cost per equivalent unit: Cost per equivalent unit for conversion costs = Total conversion costs / Equivalent units for conversion Cost per equivalent unit for conversion costs = 275,840 / 72,000 = 3.831 (rounded to three decimal places) The answer given doesn't include 3.83, so there might be a mistake in the options or in my calculations.

First, calculate the equivalent units for conversion for the month combining both the work done on the beginning inventory and the work completed during the month: Equivalent units for conversion = Units from beginning WIP inventory completed + Units started and completed during the month + Units in ending WIP x % completion The units from beginning WIP are 16,000 units, which were 40% complete. Since we are using the weighted-average method, we do not need to further complete these units; they are already accounted for in the beginning conversion cost. We only consider the additional units completed during the month and the work done on the ending WIP: Units started and completed during the month: Since 61,000 units were completed during the month and we started with 16,000 units, then 61,000 - 16,000 = 45,000 were started and completed during the month. Units in ending WIP x % completion: 14,000 units * 10% = 1,400 equivalent units for conversion Now, sum the equivalent units to find the total equivalent units for conversion: Equivalent units for conversion = 45,000 + 1,400 = 46,400 equivalent units Next, calculate the total conversion costs for the month: Total conversion costs = Beginning WIP conversion costs + Conversion costs incurred this month Total conversion costs = 29,440 + 246,400 = 275,840 Finally, calculate the cost per equivalent unit for conversion costs: Cost per equivalent unit for conversion costs = Total conversion costs / Equivalent units for conversion Cost per equivalent unit for conversion costs = 275,840 / 46,400 = 5.94 (rounded to two decimal places) There seems to be a misunderstanding because the calculated cost per equivalent unit is not matching any of the options given (A. 4.38, B. 4.42, C. 4.52). Let's check the calculations again, carefully noting that we must add the equivalent units from the beginning inventory since we're looking for the conversion costs: Equivalent units = Units completed (which were already 100% converted) + Equivalent units from ending WIP (partially converted) + Additional conversion % for the beginning WIP (partially converted at the beginning of the month) Units completed = 61,000 (already 100% converted, so they count as 61,000 equivalent units) Equivalent units from ending WIP = 14,000 * 10% = 1,400 Equivalent units for the beginning WIP needing additional work = 16,000 * (100% - 40%) = 16,000 * 60% = 9,600 So now add those up for total equivalent units: Total equivalent units = 61,000 (for completed units) + 1,400 (from ending inventory) + 9,600 (additional work needed for beginning inventory) Total equivalent units = 61,000 + 1,400 + 9,600 = 72,000 Now, let's recalculate the cost per equivalent unit with this new total: Cost per equivalent unit for conversion costs = Total conversion costs / Equivalent units Cost per equivalent unit for conversion costs = 275,840 / 72,000 = 3.83 (rounded to two decimal places) It appears there was a mistake in the initial count of equivalent units from the beginning inventory. After correcting this, we get an approximate cost per equivalent unit of 3.83, which still doesn't match the provided options. However, without rounding, the exact number is: Exact cost per equivalent unit = 275,840 / 72,000 = 3.831111...

Voici une explication détaillée de la clause : 1. **Indemnisation de la non-concurrence** : L'employeur s'engage à verser à l'employé une indemnité mensuelle si l'employé accepte de respecter la clause de non-concurrence après la fin du contrat de travail. Cette indemnité est équivalente à 30% de la rémunération mensuelle brute de base de l'employé, calculée sur la moyenne des 12 derniers mois précédant la rupture du contrat. Cela signifie que l'employé recevra une compensation financière pour ne pas travailler avec des concurrents. 2. **Droit de renonciation** : L'employeur (dans ce cas, LILI.AI) se réserve le droit de renoncer à la mise en œuvre de cette clause de non-concurrence. Cela signifie que l'employeur peut décider, avant la date effective de la fin du contrat de travail, de ne pas rendre cette clause applicable. Si l'employeur renonce à la clause, l'employé n'est alors pas tenu de respecter les restrictions liées à la concurrence et il ne recevra pas l'indemnité de non-concurrence. La clause de non-concurrence doit être raisonnable en termes de durée, de géographie et de type de travail interdit afin de ne pas restreindre excessivement la capacité de l'employé à trouver un nouvel emploi. Les spécificités de ces restrictions ne sont pas fournies dans l'extrait du contrat que vous avez partagé, mais elles doivent faire partie du contrat de travail pour que la clause soit applicable. Il est important de noter que cette clause requiert la volonté des deux parties pour être mise en œuvre.

This field is essential for various applications, especially in the realm of space exploration and technology. In microgravity, the usual forces that affect fluid behavior, such as buoyancy and sedimentation, are either absent or greatly reduced, leading to unique fluid behaviors. Here are some key details and considerations in the study of fluid dynamics under microgravity: 1. Capillary Effects: Surface tension and capillary forces become dominant when gravity is minimal. These forces influence the movement and distribution of fluids, causing them to behave in ways that can be counterintuitive to our Earth-based experiences. 2. Phase Change Processes: Boiling, melting, and freezing under microgravity are of particular interest because the absence of buoyancy-driven convection alters the heat and mass transfer processes. This can influence the efficiency of thermal systems in spacecraft. 3. Fluid Management: Controlling fluids in space is crucial for liquid fuel management in spacecraft, water supply in life support systems, and waste management. Research in microgravity helps optimize designs for fuel tanks, pipes, and other fluid transport systems to ensure reliable operation in space. 4. Interface Phenomena: Microgravity allows researchers to study the dynamics of fluid interfaces without the effects of sedimentation or stratification. This can offer insights into emulsions, foams, and other multiphase systems. 5. Protein Crystal Growth: The study of macromolecule crystallization in microgravity is important for structural biology and pharmacology. Microgravity minimizes convective currents that can disrupt the growth of high-quality crystals. 6. Combustion: The behavior of flames and combustion processes is significantly different in microgravity due to changes in the transport of heat and reactants. This research is vital for ensuring safety and efficiency of combustion in spacecraft. 7. Microfluidics: The study of microfluidic systems in microgravity can lead to advancements in miniature laboratories (lab-on-a-chip) for biological and chemical experiments in space. 8. Space Experimentation: With the advent of the International Space Station (ISS) and other space-based platforms, scientists now have the opportunity to conduct fluid dynamic experiments in a consistent microgravity environment for extended periods. Researchers typically use drop towers, sounding rockets, parabolic flights, or orbital platforms to create microgravity conditions and conduct their experiments. These studies not only enhance our understanding of the fundamental principles of fluid dynamics but also lead to the development of new technologies and systems for use in space and on Earth. Advanced computational models and simulation tools are also heavily utilized in the study of fluid dynamics under microgravity, as they can help predict fluid behavior before conducting expensive and time-consuming experiments in space."},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello!

Integrate the concepts of Psychoanalysis (ID, EGO, SUPEREGO, DEFENSE MECHANISMS, PSYCHOSEXUAL STAGES). Limit your answer to 3 concepts/sentences. 1. Dora 2. Tio Tinong 3. Ciso 4. Joey 5. Lola Cedes","output":"1. Dora: Dora struggles between her id and superego, where her sexual and emotional desires (id) clash with her internalized sense of morality and societal norms (superego). Her interactions with Tio Tinong suggest a possible fixation at the phallic stage, where she may have unresolved feelings that manifest in her current relationships. Dealing with trauma and seeking attention, she may use defense mechanisms such as repression and projection to cope with her complex feelings. 2. Tio Tinong: Tio Tinong's character represents an imbalance heavily skewed towards the id, with his actions driven by primal desires and urges without consideration for moral or social appropriateness. He may be stuck in the phallic stage of psychosexual development, as evidenced by his inappropriate behavior. His use of rationalization as a defense mechanism might allow him to justify his actions, despite them being driven by his uncontrolled libido. 3. Ciso: Ciso's behavior shows a conflict between his id, seeking gratification and touch, and his ego, which tries to navigate reality and maintain his self-image. He exhibits regression as a defense mechanism, reverting to more childlike behavior when stressed or faced with emotional difficulty. The oral stage could be influential in his character, highlighting a potential fixation that manifests in his smoking habit and need for oral stimulation. 4. Joey: Joey deals with the tensions of adolescence, grappling with his id's burgeoning sexual desires while his ego mediates these impulses with the realities of his environment and relationships. His superego is still developing but frequently clashes with his id. He may utilize displacement as a defense mechanism, shifting emotions from one object to a less threatening one to manage internal conflict. 5. Lola Cedes: Lola Cedes is depicted as an embodiment of the superego, steeped in tradition and moral values, guiding the younger characters towards socially acceptable behavior. She may use denial as a defense mechanism to ignore or refuse to accept the unacceptable behaviors of those around her. Her character suggests a well-resolved genital stage, as she appears focused on nurturing and guiding the next generation rather than her own personal gratifications."},{"instruction":"what date is it today?","output":"As an AI, I don't have real-time capabilities, so I cannot provide the current date.

It had been one of those peculiar rituals that families often find themselves locked into-- most of the year when their father was at sea the children could do as they pleased, but for the month or so that he was home they had no choice but to obey him. At the slightest mistake the house would resound with a peculiar rhythmic thwacking, like strips of meat being processed on the butcher's block. It had been a good belt, fragrant and heavy, from \\"abrod\\" as so many of her father's things had been in those days. Wound about his hand, it had been a deadly weapon. She remembered him when she was five years old, remembered the broad brown dace with the cheekbones so prominent they seemed to have been stuck onto his skin, the wide, dry, lips, the long ridge or his brow bone. His chest had been massive next to his short pipe-like legs. Without the belt his black double-knit pants would sag open; he administered bearing with his nylon briefs bulging through his fly. Her brothers have screamed. As Ciso and Joey had grown older the screams had turned to curses. Phrases, fragments of cries still drifted up through the layers of Dora's consciousness from time to time. She couldn't remember who'd said what and when. The one that had survived the years without distortion was that of leather on flesh, like baseball slamming into mitts in the children's park back of her apartment block. In the park the kids practiced on weekends under the feeble spring sun. She felt good about falling asleep, exhausted from her night shift, to the sound of suburban baseball game. It was a good neighborhood. No blacks, no Chicanos - it was a litany she would repeat quietly to herself several times a day. A place where for the first time in her life she didn't have to live in constant fear of having something valuable wrenched from her person. The letters came two or three times a year, long wilted envelopes bearing her elder brother's angular Practical-Arts teacher-script. Diplomatically-worded requests for money, suggestions that she come home for a month or so. News of their father, how his wet, trudging feet had worn a pale path from the bathroom to the bedroom where he now slept alone, of his gratitude for their gift of the walker, how one morning he had done a little dance upon the back porch stairs and slid five risers down on his tailbone. How he had sat there for 20 minutes trying to fathom a hand that urgently caressed the worn wood of its own volition. She read these letters once or twice before slipping them into the plastic-mesh berry basket on top of the refrigerator. On her way to and from the nursing home where she worked, in twilight half the time, coat bundled about her short, dumpy figure, she would think of their contents, wondering at her own silence. On Saturday mornings, she would take the letter down and pass her fingers over their surfaces. Vague body memories, the leather belt descending to stripe her flesh. Dora made herself a cup of coffee, fitting the containers of Nescafe and Alaska Evap back into place on the dining table tray. She willed the tepid liquid about her mouth, trying to work up some enthusiasm for the tasks at hand. The quiet of mid-morning had descended upon the house. A singular odor pervaded the air, an odor from her childhood, a blend of the kitchen smells of dank wood, mossy earthen jars, residual detergent- and now, the rank odor of urine and antibiotics. She nudged aside the curtain hanging in the door to the sickroom. On the bed that Ciso and Joey shared when they were boys, her father lay on his side, head turned toward the wall, legs together and bent. She thought of the babies, fully formed but not quite human, floating in the formalin jars on the shelf of her long-ago college classroom. The old man had wet himself. The fresh warm odor of bodily discharge taunted her nostrils, mingling with the sharper, richer stench of the mattress. He wore a T-shirt that said Plaza Central School on the back and which most certainly belonged to Ciso. The T-shirt was so ancient and grubby that the urine had soaked through the hem and up her father's back. She suppressed a shudder at the sight of his bare buttocks. They were round and brown, like something you would eat for breakfast. They belonged to a much younger man. \\"Narciso,\\" her father said. Dora started; he was awake. \\"Ciso's out,\\" she said quickly. The old man grunted. Even in his illness his voice was heavy with the old irritation. \\"When will he be back?\\" Dora did not answer. Of course it was Ciso he would want; good stolid Ciso, who never married, fearing the father he might become, who survived the blows to be... what? A Practical Arts teacher at the local elementary school, sunburnt from bending among rows of vegetables. The man who made the school's Christmas lanterns and fiesta tableaus, mouth set in the perpetually kindly grin of the powerless. Dora moved to the bedside table and took up a glass half-filled with water, last night's dinner plate with clumps of desiccated rice still on it, used syringes, a crusted face towel. \\"There's a mess \\" the old man said. She stood and looked at him. \\"It needs to be cleaned up,\\" he pressed on. It was easier when they both pretended it was someone else's body they were dealing with. In the kitchen she found the rags draped on the wooden shutters above the sink, where Ciso had left them the night before. She took them up, sluicing water over them from an earthen jar, as had done when she was a child. The household had had running water for years, yet still kept these ancient relics. She felt dazed, enervated. The urine had traveled some distance down her father's thighs, and there was a warm blot of excrement, too. Ciso had forgotten to put the bedpan within his reach. There it was, she saw, partway under the bed, still gleaming dully from the scrubbing eye she had given it yesterday. It was amazing how incompetent her brothers became the moment she took over. With a fresh towel she pursued a blotch of shit over the old man's skin. A fresh sore was forming in the small of his back. She found a clean edge of the towel and dabbed around her father's groin; his penis, walnut-like, wobbled at her touch. The old man suffered his ministrations with contempt. His face burned. A fly alighted on her lips. She brushed it off with her sleeve, a sensation of wet. The creature had teast on the clean liquid from the sores that had magical bloomed across her father's helpless limbs in the past weeks. In the bathroom she flung the rags under the lone tap and turned the water on. She did the laundry, hers, her bachelor brother's, a few of the soiled sheets, and took them out into the backyard, dodging the branches of the sapling guavas. Trudging across the trampled-down earth, she couldn't resist sneaking a glance back at the house. Small, and dingier than it ought to have been, the nipa roof bleached almost white, so that at long last it blended with the galvanized iron rooftops of the neighbors. Once when she was in college she had overheard her mother pleading for him to build a new one, the woman's voice rising to a shriek, aimed at the lawanit walls, the chalky dust caking the leaves of the gumamelas: The field hands live better with their dollars from Saudi!\\" He remained silent at this taunt, she remembered. It was he who had instilled in his family the difference between a trained seaman like himself and the ignorant worker escaping from the surrounding haciendas to the Middle East. She had known the meaning of dollars from early childhood, when her father had been away all of the year and they lived in the other house, the bigger one. He's abroad, her mother, dead 15 years now, used to say, eyebrows arched finely, to the neighbors. He's in Germany, she might add, or in Panama. Growing up, Dora had known what it had been to be both blessed and despised. He sent them checks, parcels, letters. He sent his brother enough money tor a jeepney-transport business; his sister's property he rescued from a heavy mortgage. No one talked about his life, the years aboard the ship. As a child she had been fascinated by the way he would come home every year Smaller, angrier, more leathery, until one day in her teens, he fell into bed and lay there glaring up at her and her mother, unable to rise, enraged, knowing that at the end of his furlough they expected him to pull up his carcass and make his way back to the dungeon of his vessel. Not once did they ask him how he felt. After all he was a man. Men endured. Ciso was in the kitchen when she came back with the empty basin. Since her return he had stopped taking a packed lunch to school; he would bike the five blocks to the house in search of her insipid cooking. He ate the watery adobo, the salads she insisted on, as though it were he who were to die within weeks. Dora greeted him with a nod and, without preamble, scooped rice out of the cauldron and set the cold platter of beef on the table. She had fed the family feds with the same grudging tenderness years ago. Cats and dogs quivering in corners, traumatized by the most recent explosion: Joey, gone bad in the fifth grade, caught sniffing glue and strung up in a sack over the stove; the marmalade kitten, her favorite, thrown twisting through the air for being sick on the sofa. Brother and sister ate together, cautiously glancing from time to time at the door to their father's room, waiting for the gravelly voice to summon them. Two abandoned children. Dora thought, middle-aged by 35. Lola Cedes will be coming tonight,\\" Ciso volunteered at last. \\"Lola Cedes?\\" \\"The mananambal. The herb woman.\\" \\"What do you need her for She said. \\"Dr. Perez comes every week.\\" \\"It is only after Lola Cedes's massages that Papa can sleep.\\" She mulled this over for a while, before saying almost routinely, \\"Massages are the last thing he needs. There's so much fluid in the tissues.\\" \\"Of course, you would know. \\"You are the nurse.\\" Ciso laid his spoon and fork down and gave her his sad, resigned smile. She felt the ghost of an old irritation: that inability of his to hold to an opinion, even with his own sister. \\"He left the dishes on the table for her to clean up, guided his rusty bicycle through the front gate, went off squeaking down the street, listing perilously from side to side. When the mananambal arrived it was evening, the cicadas singing in the bushes, the acacias black blurs against a murky lavender sky. She stood on the top step and knocked gently: an old woman in a faded print skirt and a shapeless blouse. A thin, staring girl, about 14, trailed after her. Ciso came to greet the healer, and they spoke in quiet voices. Lola Cedes made her way to the sickroom, nodding casually at Dora. She had brought with her a faint odor of herbs and lemongrass; it hung in the air, mixed with the scent of her sweat. The younger woman stood in the doorway and watched them. Ciso had gotten down on his knees by the bedside, was murmuring something to himself or perhaps to the little chapel formed by his clasped hands. Some vernacular prayer, rote. Over her brother's bowed head, Lola Cedes's eyes met hers. \\"Your father will not be healed unless you, too, pray,\\" the mananambal said. Dora took a couple of steps forward to accept a well-thumbed booklet from her. The prayers were in Cebuano. She would never be able to read them aloud; it had been too long. \\"And how are you tonight, Tio Tinong?\\" the herb woman said, making conversation, easing the thin shirt off the old man's back, manipulating the flaccid limbs with a certain tenderness. Feebly, he tried to move his arms; they flailed in the air, the hands loosely balled, like a baby's. Dora had never seen her father in this room with any woman but her mother. Lola Cedes poured liniment into her palm from a brown bottle. With a hand like a piece of sentient rubber, now pliant, now assertive, the herb woman described circles across the old man's flesh. He didn't look at her. He looked instead at Dora, eyes black hollows under the ridge of his brow bone. Dora matched the stare. The herb Woman's hand stroked him at the periphery of his vision, devoting equal time to the nerveless parts of his body; under her touch his face softened, his shoulders lost her rigidity. His eyes closed and his lips stretched in what could only be a smile. Dora advanced upon the little tableau by the bed, cold all of a sudden. but fascinated. His face had never looked so unguarded, so content. She would have worn the same look as a baby, and it would have been he who would have stood over her in this fashion and perhaps tickled her smooth belly and her little furled hands tenderly. This same moment of peace, before she wriggled beneath his touch and gave out thin wailing cries of distress, and he, helpless, would have thundered for her mother to come and shut her up, berated her for allowing the infant to go hungry. Later she would learn to quiet down at his approach and glare at him from under a heavy shelf of brow so like his own, and he would curse her and curse his fate for having fathered such a sullen child -such sullen, worthless children for whom he would have to go back to his ship in a few more weeks, risking life and limb. And you would beat us! Dora cried silently. You kicked us around the floor! The arching length of that old leather belt had brought her child's flesh to life and simultaneously blanched it of all feeling forever. His eyes opened and he saw the pity and hatred in hers, and as Lola Cedes worked gently over his shoulders, he let his head loll to one side in resignation. Dora clenched her rough nurse's hands, brought them protectively up to her chest. An image of greenish-white hallways rose up behind her lids. For ten years, in a fevered orgy of giving, she had mopped up shit, smiled briskly into pale parchment faces, put the warmth of lifetime's intercourse into her voice. I could make you happy now, she thought frantically, to the defeated face. I could stretch out my hands, feel you, heal you. But she knew it was too late; it no longer mattered; she and her father they were beyond all help. There was only her life, and a sense of bitter regret, for never having known him. She thought of her apartment, dark and silent now in her absence, bereft of a bridegroom, its pristine air shattered from time to time with the voices of children, raised in what were almost cries of love. And she crossed her arms and pressed her fists tight, to her breast, lest she burst open, spill away, bleed at the sudden contact with his skin.","output":"Thank you for sharing an excerpt from \\"Touch\\" by Lakambini Sitoy. If you have any specific questions or aspects you'd like to explore about this story, such as character motivations, themes, or psychoanalytic interpretations pertaining to the characters or narrative events, please let me know, and I'll be glad to provide analysis and insights."},{"instruction":"thats the story can you please do psychoanalyse it agian","output":"Based on the excerpt from \\"Touch\\" by Lakambini Sitoy, we can apply psychoanalytic concepts to the characters and their interactions: 1. Dora: Dora seems to be driven by her superego, which upholds societal expectations and her moral stance, yet she also appears to be struggling with repressed anger and pain from her childhood trauma. This repression points to the defense mechanism of avoiding confronting the emotional and physical abuse inflicted by her father. Her aversion to his physical state in illness might also be related to her conflicted feelings from the past (id) that are kept in check by her desire to maintain control (ego) in the face of vulnerability. 2. Tio Tinong (Father): Tio Tinong, the father figure, is presented as the source of childhood trauma with his abusive behavior driven by the id's aggressive impulses. The id operates on the pleasure principle, which in his case could manifest in the form of exercising power and control over his children. His current state of helplessness could represent the ego's loss of control over the body, reducing him to a state of childlike dependency, which inverts the power dynamic he once held. 3. Ciso: Ciso exhibits actions influenced by the superego, as he seems to be restraining his own desires (id) because of the fear of becoming like his abusive father. His chosen profession, environment, and caregiving actions suggest an overcompensatory behavior, which might be indicative of a reaction formation—a defense mechanism where an individual expresses the opposite of their unconscious desires. 4. Joey (mentioned in the background): Although Joey's presence in the excerpt is minimal, the transformation from screams to curses as he grows older might suggest a rebellion against authorities—possibly the ego asserting itself against the superego's control. Joey's resentment might stem from his id's response to the violence and lack of a nurturing environment during his psychosexual development. 5. Lola Cedes: Lola Cedes apparently embodies the healing, nurturing force—perhaps even serving as the societal superego in this setting. Her role is to comfort and offer traditional healing, which can be interpreted as a representation of the superego's attempt to alleviate the guilt, pain, and dysfunction of the family unit through culturally accepted means. In summary, the characters in \\"Touch\\" exhibit complex dynamics where their actions and behaviors can be analyzed through the lens of Freudian psychoanalysis, examining how their ids, egos, and superegos interact with each other and with their defense mechanisms in response to past trauma and current circumstances."},{"instruction":"Input Variables: 1.

Перед началом мейоза клетки проходят через интерфазу, во время которой происходит репликация ДНК, в результате чего каждая хромосома состоит из двух сестринских хроматид, соединенных в центромере. Однако для мейоза характерно образование гомологичных пар хромосом, так что хромосомный набор остается диплоидным (2n), но количество молекул ДНК удваивается. - **Число молекул ДНК**: Каждая хромосома реплицировала свою ДНК, так что теперь в клетке 96 молекул ДНК (поскольку каждая из 48 хромосом состоит из двух хроматид, и каждая хроматида содержит молекулу ДНК). 2. **В метафазе мейоза II**: - **Хромосомный набор**: После первого мейотического деления клетки становятся гаплоидными (n), но поскольку каждая хромосома все еще состоит из двух сестринских хроматид, число хромосом в каждой клетке остается 48. Однако следует учесть, что это уже другое поколение клеток, поскольку первое мейотическое деление уже произошло, и клетки разделились. - **Число молекул ДНК**: В каждой из этих клеток по-прежнему 48 молекул ДНК, так как каждая хромосома состоит из двух сестринских хроматид, каждая из которых несет молекулу ДНК. Но важно отметить, что к метафазе II мейоза хромосомы готовятся к разделению своих сестринских хроматид, так что после завершения мейоза II каждая гаплоидная дочерняя клетка будет содержать 24 хромосомы, и каждая хромосома будет состоять из одной молекулы ДНК. **Объяснение полученных результатов**: - Перед началом мейоза клетка готовится к делению, реплицируя свою ДНК, что удваивает количество молекул ДНК в ядре, но хромосомный набор остается диплоидным (2n=48). - После первого мейотического деления клетки становятся гаплоидными, но каждая хромосома до сих пор состоит из двух хроматид, сохраняя количество молекул ДНК на уровне 48 в каждой клетке к метафазе II мейоза. - Мейоз важен для обеспечения генетического разнообразия и поддержания постоянства числа хромосом от поколения к поколению в половом размножении.","output":"Приступим к анализу ядер семязачатка табака в профазе I мейоза и метафазе II.

They are of Mongolic origin and are closely related to other groups in the broader Mongolic ethnic family. Their culture, language, and historical experiences share similarities with several ethnic groups, including: 1. Mongols: Buryats are directly related to the Mongols found in Mongolia. They share linguistic ties through the Mongolic language family, with Buryat being a Mongolic language. Historical and cultural bonds also exist due to shared ancestry and traditions dating back to the Mongol Empire. 2. Kalmyks: The Kalmyks are another Mongolic-speaking group, residing primarily in the Republic of Kalmykia in Russia. They migrated from Central Asia to the Russian steppe in the 17th century, and their language and cultural practices are similar to those of the Buryats. 3. Oirats: Oirats are Western Mongols who historically roamed the area stretching from the west of Lake Baikal to Eastern Europe. The Kalmyks are descendants of the Oirats, and both the Buryats and Oirats have cultural and linguistic ties. 4. Khalkha Mongols: The Khalkha are the largest ethnic group in Mongolia, and there is a substantial amount of shared culture and language between the Khalkha and Buryats. 5. Tuvans: The Tuvans are another Turkic ethnic group that live in the Republic of Tuva in Russia. They have historical and cultural connections with the Buryats, though their language is Turkic rather than Mongolic. 6. Evenks: The Evenks are a Tungusic-speaking people of Siberia. Some Evenk groups have been in contact with the Buryats and have influenced each other culturally. 7. Soyots: The Soyots are a small ethnic group in the region of the Buryat Republic. They share cultural and religious traditions with the Buryats and are recognized as one of the Indigenous peoples of the Russian North, Siberia, and the Far East. It is important to note that while these groups are related, each has its own distinct language, culture, and history. Over time, interactions with neighboring peoples, different historical trajectories, and the adoption of various religious practices (such as Tibetan Buddhism, Shamanism, and Russian Orthodoxy) have led to a rich tapestry of cultures within the Siberian and Mongolic-speaking world."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It is known for its vast territory and sparse population. The ethnic groups in the Sakha Republic are diverse, with the largest being the Sakha (Yakuts), who are a Turkic-speaking group and constitute the majority of the population. Here are the primary ethnic groups in the Sakha Republic: 1. Sakha (Yakuts): The Sakha people are indigenous to the region and make up around 50% of the population. They are traditionally horse and cattle breeders, and many Sakha people today are engaged in agriculture, political life, and cultural activities. 2. Russians: Russians are the second-largest ethnic group in the Sakha Republic, making up a significant part of the population. They have played a crucial role in the development of the region since the Russian Empire expanded into the area in the 17th century. 3. Ukrainians: There is a small Ukrainian community in the Sakha Republic, although it is much smaller than the Russian or Sakha populations. 4. Evenks: The Evenks are an indigenous Tungusic-speaking people who are traditionally reindeer herders. They live in various parts of Siberia, including the Sakha Republic. 5. Evens: Evens, like the Evenks, are a Tungusic-speaking people. They are also indigenous to Siberia and are traditionally involved in reindeer herding, fishing, and hunting. 6. Others: Small numbers of other indigenous ethnic groups live in the Sakha Republic, including the Yukaghir, Chukchi, and Dolgan peoples. Additionally, there are populations of Tatars, Buryats, and other ethnic groups from different parts of Russia and former Soviet states. The Sakha Republic is known for its efforts to preserve the language and cultural heritage of its indigenous peoples, including promoting education and media in the Yakut language and supporting traditional festivals and customs. It's important to note that demographic compositions can change over time due to migration, birth rates, and various social factors, so the exact numbers and proportions of these ethnic groups may vary."},{"instruction":"Related ethnic groups of Canadians","output":"Ethnic groups in Canada are highly diverse as Canada is a country built largely through immigration. Various waves of immigrants have settled in the country over its history, contributing to the multicultural fabric of Canadian society. Ethnic groups in Canada can be categorized based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to: 1. **Indigenous Peoples**: The original inhabitants of Canada, including: - First Nations - Inuit - Métis 2. **French Canadians**: Descendants of the original French colonists, primarily in Quebec but also in other provinces like New Brunswick and Ontario. 3. **British Canadians**: Including descendants of English, Scottish, and Welsh immigrants. 4. **European Canadians**: Encompassing various other European ethnicities such as: - Italian Canadians - Ukrainian Canadians - German Canadians - Polish Canadians - Dutch Canadians - Portuguese Canadians - Greek Canadians - Scandinavian Canadians (such as Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish) 5. **Asian Canadians**: Comprising several groups from the Asian continent, such as: - Chinese Canadians - Indian Canadians - Filipino Canadians - Vietnamese Canadians - Korean Canadians - Japanese Canadians 6. **Middle Eastern and West Asian Canadians**: Including but not limited to: - Lebanese Canadians - Iranian Canadians - Armenian Canadians 7. **Latin American Canadians**: People from Central and South American countries. 8. **African Canadians**: Including those of recent African descent and those whose ancestors have been in Canada for many generations (such as Black Nova Scotians, descendants of the Black Loyalists and refugees from the War of 1812). 9. **Caribbean Canadians**: Those with roots in the Caribbean islands. 10. **Jewish Canadians**: With roots in various countries, they have formed a prominent community in Canada. 11. **South Asian Canadians**: From countries such as India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Nepal. Canadian society prides itself on being a cultural mosaic rather than a melting pot, recognizing and celebrating the various ethnic backgrounds and cultural traditions of its people. Multiple generations of immigrants have maintained cultural ties with their countries of origin while also identifying as Canadians, creating a rich and unique national identity. It is important to note that the categorizations of ethnic groups can be complex and overlapping due to the diverse and mixed heritage that many Canadians possess. Furthermore, the way individuals self-identify can differ based on personal, familial, and community identities. Official classifications by institutions such as Statistics Canada involve self-reported census data, which can provide insights into the ethnicity and cultural origins of the Canadian population."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Однако, с ростом числа дронов, возникают новые проблемы и вызовы в обеспечении безопасности и защиты от потенциального неправомерного использования этих устройств. В этой статье мы сосредоточимся на одном из важных аспектов системы защиты от дронов - обнаружении. Обнаружение дронов является первым шагом в создании эффективной системы защиты и предоставляет возможность своевременного реагирования на наличие дронов в определенной территории. Дроны обычно излучают ряд сигналов, которые могут быть использованы для их обнаружения. Первым и наиболее распространенным типом сигнала являются тепловые излучения. В силу физических закономерностей, даже самый современный и технологически продвинутый дрон будет излучать тепловое излучение, которое может быть обнаружено специальными датчиками тепла. Другой тип сигнала - звуковые колебания, создаваемые моторами или вентиляторами дрона. Это также может быть использовано для его обнаружения. И, наконец, наиболее распространенным типом сигнала являются радиочастотные сигналы, которые используются для связи дрона с его оператором. Они могут быть обнаружены и проанализированы специализированным оборудованием. Система обнаружения дронов собирает данные с различных датчиков, таких как тепловизоры, микрофоны и приемники радиочастотных сигналов, для подтверждения присутствия дрона в окрестностях. В зависимости от выбранной методики, система обнаружения может определять предполагаемое местоположение дрона. Для обеспечения эффективного и надежного обнаружения дронов, существуют различные технологии и стратегии. Также, важно учитывать ограничения и технические особенности каждого метода обнаружения.

Тепловое обнаружение имеет преимущества с точки зрения устойчивости к погодным условиям, доступности идентификации и более низкой стоимости, чем системы на базе радаров. Однако практическая дальность обнаружения (51 м) значительно меньше, чем у большинства других подходов, следовательно, повышение детализации схемы обнаружения или улучшение разрешения тепловизионной камеры являются основными проблемы.","output":"Тепловое обнаружение является одним из методов, используемых для обнаружения дронов, основываясь на их тепловых сигнатурах. Физические компоненты дрона, такие как двигатели, батареи и внутреннее оборудование, излучают значительное количество тепла, которое может быть обнаружено с помощью тепловизионных камер. Это позволяет идентифицировать беспилотные летательные аппараты-мишени по их тепловым сигнатурам. Тепловое обнаружение обладает рядом преимуществ. Во-первых, оно устойчиво к погодным условиям, поскольку не зависит от видимого света и может работать в любое время суток или при недостаточной освещенности. Во-вторых, тепловое обнаружение является относительно доступным с точки зрения стоимости по сравнению с системами, основанными на радарах. Кроме того, идентификация тепловых сигнатур дронов достаточно надежна и может помочь в отличии дрона от других объектов. Однако, тепловое обнаружение имеет свои ограничения. Практическая дальность обнаружения при использовании данного метода в большинстве случаев ограничена до 51 метра, что существенно меньше, чем у других подходов. Для повышения детализации схемы обнаружения или улучшения разрешения тепловизионной камеры требуется решить эти проблемы. Таким образом, тепловое обнаружение является эффективным методом для обнаружения дронов, благодаря их тепловым сигнатурам.

Their ethnic origins are shared with other East Slavic peoples, particularly Ukrainians and Belarusians. Here are some of the related ethnic groups with shared ancestry or cultural ties to the Russians: 1. Ukrainians: Ukrainians are East Slavic people primarily living in Ukraine. They share historical and linguistic roots with Russians, but have developed a distinct national identity and culture. 2. Belarusians: Belarusians are another East Slavic ethnic group, culturally and linguistically close to both Russians and Ukrainians. Belarusians primarily reside in the Republic of Belarus. 3. Poles: While Poles are a West Slavic people and primarily Catholic, historically there has been significant interaction and shared history with Russia due to geopolitical circumstances, such as the partitions of Poland and the Soviet era. As such, there are cultural and familial ties between Russians and Poles, particularly in border regions and among people with mixed ancestry. 4. Bulgarians: Bulgarians are a South Slavic people with some historical and linguistic ties to Russians. Both nations share a common heritage as Slavic peoples, and their languages use the Cyrillic alphabet. They also share religious ties through Eastern Orthodoxy. 5. Serbs: Serbs, also South Slavic, share religious and cultural ties with Russians. The Serbian Orthodox Church, like the Russian Orthodox Church, is part of Eastern Orthodoxy, and the two have a history of support and solidarity. 6. East Slavic minorities: Within Russia itself, there are several recognized East Slavic ethnic minorities, such as the Rusyns, who have a close cultural association with Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians. 7. Other Slavic peoples: This includes Croats, Czechs, Slovaks, Macedonians, and others who, while not as closely related to Russians as the East Slavs, still share a broader pan-Slavic heritage, which includes linguistic similarities and cultural elements. It is important to note that while these groups share historical, linguistic, and cultural ties with Russians, they all have distinct national identities and cultural characteristics. The relationships among these groups have been shaped by a complex history of alliances, conflicts, and political changes."},{"instruction":"please correct the grammar: Below link is the minutes on meeting for earlier’s meeting.","output":"Please correct the grammar: The link below contains the minutes of the earlier meeting."}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:N},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:z,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},q={class:"search-container"},P={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},j=["disabled"],H={key:0},R={key:1};function F(n,e,l,p,o,r){const m=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",q,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):d("",!0)]),t("div",P,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(r.displayedPoems,(s,g)=>(a(),k(m,{key:g,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",D,' No results found for "'+c(o.searchQuery)+'".
