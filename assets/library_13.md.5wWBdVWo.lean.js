He intended to use this invasion force to strike at England. They never invaded, but Napoleon's troops received careful and invaluable training for future military operations. The men at Boulogne formed the core for what Napoleon later called La Grande Armée. At the start, this French army had about 200,000 men organized into seven corps, which were large field units that contained 36 to 40 cannons each and were capable of independent action until other corps could come to the rescue. A single corps properly situated in a strong defensive position could survive at least a day without support, giving the Grande Armée countless strategic and tactical options on every campaign. On top of these forces, Napoleon created a cavalry reserve of 22,000 organized into two cuirassier divisions, four mounted dragoon divisions, one division of dismounted dragoons, and one of light cavalry, all supported by 24 artillery pieces. By 1805, the Grande Armée had grown to a force of 350,000 men, who were well equipped, well trained, and led by competent officers.\\"?

That year, Jordan was the only Washington player to play in all 82 games, starting in 67 of them. He averaged 20.0 points, 6.1 rebounds, 3.8 assists, and 1.5 steals per game. He also shot 45% from the field, and 82% from the free throw line. Even though he turned 40 during the season, he scored 20 or more points 42 times, 30 or more points nine times, and 40 or more points three times. On February 21, 2003, Jordan became the first 40-year-old to tally 43 points in an NBA game. During his stint with the Wizards, all of Jordans home games at the MCI Center were sold out, and the Wizards were the second most-watched team in the NBA, averaging 20,172 fans a game at home and 19,311 on the road. However, neither of Jordans final two seasons resulted in a playoff appearance for the Wizards, and Jordan was often unsatisfied with the play of those around him.

Trump delivered a scathing attack on Hillary Clinton’s record on Wednesday, accusing her of being a “world-class liar” and incompetent while trying to lay out a positive vision for America in a major speech intended to put his sputtering presidential campaign back on the offensive. The remarks came amid a rough stretch for Mr. Trump, who this week fired his campaign manager, reported weak fund-raising numbers and was trailing Mrs. Clinton in most polls. Seeking to regain his footing, he unleashed a torrent of criticism at his rival interspersed with his own policy proposals. “Hillary Clinton wants to be president, but she doesn’t have the temperament, or, as Bernie Sanders said, the judgment, to be president,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump assailed Mrs. Clinton for supporting trade policies that he said harmed American workers, and said that as secretary of state she was responsible for the creation of the Islamic State and for chaos in the Middle East. He explicitly blamed Mrs. Clinton for the death of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens in Benghazi, Libya, calling her a liar who ignored his requests for help. “Her decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched,” he said. Mr. Trump’s own policies have been under siege recently, as Mrs. Clinton has taken him on more aggressively. Last week, Mrs. Clinton said that he was not fit to have his hands on the country’s nuclear codes, and on Tuesday she warned that his business record suggested that he would sink the nation’s economy if he was elected president. Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, delivered a speech in New York on Wednesday, in which he went after Hillary Clinton on emails, Benghazi and the Clinton Foundation. Mr. Trump rebutted those assertions during his speech in New York on Wednesday, describing himself as a humble entrepreneur. “I started off in Brooklyn, New York, not so long ago, with a small loan and built a business worth over 10 billion,” said Mr. Trump, who actually got a 1 million loan from his father decades ago. “I have always had a talent for building businesses and, importantly, creating jobs.” He added, “That is a talent our country desperately needs.” The speech represented Mr. Trump’s most high-profile performance since he reset his campaign by firing Corey Lewandowski, his campaign manager, on Monday morning. Since Mr. Lewandowski’s departure, Mr. Trump has unveiled a more active rapid response operation and announced a wave of new hires. Some of Mr. Trump’s policy proposals were more tempered than they have been in other venues. When discussing the influx of refugees from the Middle East, he did not mention his provocative ban on Muslim migration. And instead of calling Muslims complicit in terrorist acts, he said that most of them were innocent victims. “ISIS also threatens peaceful Muslims across the Middle East, and peaceful Muslims across the world, who have been terribly victimized by horrible brutality — and who only want to raise their kids in peace and safety,” Mr. Trump said, using another name for the Islamic State. Mr. Trump, who regularly paints a dire picture of America’s declining stature, tried to adopt a more hopeful tenor when describing the kind of president he would be. He argued that he, not Mrs. Clinton, would improve the predicaments of the poor and minorities. “We stopped believing in what America could do, and became reliant on other countries, other people, and other institutions,” Mr. Trump said. “We lost our sense of purpose, and daring. But that’s not who we are.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Donald Trump has labeled Hillary Clinton a \\"world-class liar,\\" blaming her for the rise of ISIS, the death of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens in Benghazi, and criticizing her support for trade policies that harmed American workers.

If the biologists predict a decrease in deer birth rates are there a high amount of resources or low amount of resources?  A team of biologists has been monitoring the deer population in the state of Wisconsin. They use past data and current conditions to predict how the population will grow or shrink and recommend how many hunting licenses the state should issue during hunting season to keep the population stable.  Hint: In nature, when the population size is small, there is usually plenty of food and other resources for each individual. When there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can easily reproduce, so the birth rate is high. As the population increases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease. When necessary resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will die. Overall, the population cannot reproduce at the same rate, so the birth rates drop. This will cause the population growth rate to decrease.

An appeals court returned his conviction to the original trial bench, allowing him to plead guilty to a lesser charge and get out of prison in three years, most of which he had already served. But his freedom came with a price, something that didn’t quite register with him at the time: as part of his plea agreement with prosecutors, Meade agreed to give up his civil rights: the right to vote, to serve on a jury and to run for office. “At the time, when I first accepted the plea deal, I didn’t understand the consequences,” Meade says. Fourteen years and a pair of college and law degrees later, Meade, now 50, still can’t vote; his application to regain his civil rights was rejected in 2011. The reason: a new Florida law that requires felons like him to wait for seven years before they could apply for rights restoration. Home to nearly a quarter of the nation's disenfranchised felons, Florida has become a battleground in a national debate over felony disenfranchisement laws. With lawmakers deeply divided over the issue, Meade says he wants the state’s voters to change the system when they head to the polls on Nov. 6. He’s promoting a ballot initiative that would amend the state's constitution, restoring the voting rights of all felons in Florida (except those convicted of murder and sexual assault) after they’ve completed the terms of their sentence. The measure enjoys broad voter support. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in February showed that 67 percent of Floridians were in favor of restoring the voting rights of felons other than those convicted of murder and sexual assault. Another poll showed support at 71 percent. “We’re going to change the system,” Meade says confidently. “What we’re doing is taking the power out of the hands of politicians and we’re allowing the citizens of the state of Florida to decide whether or not folks should have a second chance, to be able to vote.” Question: Who got a law degree? === The answer to the above question is A:","output":"Desmond Meade got a law degree."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

SINGAPORE — Envoys from the United States and North Korea are holding talks to iron out any last-minute differences before Tuesday's historic summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that veteran diplomat Sung Kim is leading the U.S. delegation in a working group meeting Monday at the city-state's Ritz Carlton hotel. The North Korea side is being led by Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui. Monday's meeting is apparently aimed at narrowing the gap between the U.S. and North Korea over the demand for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. President Trump expressed confidence about his meeting upon his arrival in Singapore Sunday, telling reporters after stepping down from Air Force One that he his feeling \\"very good\\" about Tuesday's summit. Ahead of his arrival, Trump acknowledged he is heading into “unknown territory” for the meeting Tuesday. In response to a question from VOA News just before heading to Asia from the Group of Seven summit in Canada, Trump said “I really feel confident” about the unprecedented encounter between a sitting American president and a member of the family dynasty which has maintained iron-fist control over one of the world’s most reclusive countries for three generations. Trump added that he believes Kim, half the age of the American president, “wants to do something great for his people.” But Trump cautioned that Kim “won’t have that opportunity again” if the talks do not go well -- describing this opportunity for diplomacy with the United States as a “one-time shot.” Trump and others in his government have said advancement has been made on obtaining a commitment from Kim to give up all his nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles. Progress could lead to a peace treaty and formally end a state of war on the Korean peninsula, which has persisted for nearly 70 years. Whether such a deal can be done, Trump declared on Saturday, is something he will know almost... Who is feeling 'very good' about the summit? Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A.

Please answer the following question: What is the name of the person who applied to an art academy in St. Petersburg in 1909?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Lissitzky was born on November 23, 1890 in Pochinok, a small Jewish community 50 kilometres (31 mi) southeast of Smolensk, former Russian Empire. During his childhood, he lived and studied in the city of Vitebsk, now part of Belarus, and later spent 10 years in Smolensk living with his grandparents and attending the Smolensk Grammar School, spending summer vacations in Vitebsk. Always expressing an interest and talent in drawing, he started to receive instruction at 13 from Yehuda Pen, a local Jewish artist, and by the time he was 15 was teaching students himself. In 1909, he applied to an art academy in Saint Petersburg, but was rejected. While he passed the entrance exam and was qualified, the law under the Tsarist regime only allowed a limited number of Jewish students to attend Russian schools and universities. Like many other Jews then living in the Russian Empire, Lissitzky went to study in Germany. He left in 1909 to study architectural engineering at a Technische Hochschule in Darmstadt, Germany. During the summer of 1912, Lissitzky, in his own words, \\"wandered through Europe\\", spending time in Paris and covering 1,200 kilometres (750 mi) on foot in Italy, teaching himself about fine art and sketching architecture and landscapes that interested him. His interest in ancient Jewish culture had originated during the contacts with a Paris-based group of Russian Jews led by sculptor Ossip Zadkine, a lifetime friend of Lissitzky since early childhood, who exposed Lissitzky to conflicts between different groups within the diaspora. Also in 1912 some of his pieces were included for the first time in an exhibit by the St. Petersburg Artists Union; a notable first step. He remained in Germany until the outbreak of World War I, when he was forced to return home through Switzerland and the Balkans, along with many of his countrymen, including other expatriate artists born in the former Russian Empire, such as Wassily Kandinsky and Marc Chagall.Upon his return to Moscow, Lissitzky attended the Polytechnic...

THE PERVERT'S GUIDE TO CINEMA (2007) ****  If Loving Cinema Makes Me A Pervert, So Be It! If you are a true 'moviefreak' like me then I'm sure you can't get enough of films about film-making and I don't mean necessarily the dry documentary know and then. I mean a total discourse on the film viewing experience. Well if that's the case have I got a lulu of a film experiment for you. In Sophie Fiennes (sister of Ralph & Joseph if you were wondering) has noted philosopher cum cinephile Slavoj Zizek give his analysis on cinema with some impressive (and often outrageous) takes on everything from the silent era of Chaplin thru the modern age of the Wachowski Brothers analyzing, probing, and pontificating about the psychosexual underpinnings, socioeconomic, political and of course indefinable magic of the film going experience with his unflagging, determined and near-frenetic dissertations. To go from explaining how The Bates' house in PSYCHO is actually the mirrored psyche of the conflicted Norman Bates with each level as his Ego, Superego & Id is one thing but then to suggest the same thing about each Marx Brother in barely a beat is a remarkable test of faith that wins over the skeptic layman. Although I had no idea who Zizek was  he resembles a hybrid of filmmaker Brian DePalma, European actor Rade Serbedzija and the hyperkinetic energy of filmmakers Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorsese  with his sibilant tongue and passion, the host comes across as a mad prophet.  Fiennes cleverly inserts Zizek into several of the film clips' backgrounds peppered throughout making for a humorous tone but still lets the ranting and raving continue full throttle giving pause for argument in three acts covering the gamut of films by the likes of Kubrick, Lynch, Hitchcock and films as diverse as THE WIZARD OF OZ, THE RED SHOES, and FIGHT CLUB.  There's something for everyone and if one man can provoke an argument or at least a reason to discuss a film's themes  even if they are Freudian/Jungian to a fault  then I say this collection of film theory is worth the watch. Seek it out now if you can before it comes to home video; it's the only way to appreciate it.

Lisa Unger gave the Strand an exclusive interview where she spoke about her suspense novels and shared her extensive knowledge of the craft of writing. ||||| Williams is best known as the author of such plays as A Streetcar Named Desire and The Glass Menagerie      A previously unseen short story by US writer Tennessee Williams, inspired in part by an old college girlfriend, has been published for the first time.      Crazy Night refers to a student named Anna Jean - a reference to Anna Jean O'Donnell, whom Williams briefly dated while at the University of Missouri.      Williams wrote poetry about O'Donnell but only made passing mention to her in his notebooks and memoirs.      The short story features in the spring edition of literary journal The Strand.      According to its managing editor Andrew Gulli, the story, believed to have been written in the 1930s, could be \\"the missing piece of the puzzle\\" surrounding Williams' formative romantic liaison.      The writer would go on to use his mother Edwina as the model for Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire and based the character of Laura Wingfield in The Glass Menagerie on his sister Rose.      In Crazy Night, the narrator, a college freshman on an unnamed campus, has an intimate encounter with Anna Jean only to lose her to another student.      The title of the story refers to a college ritual during which students are expected to binge on alcohol and sex. ||||| NEW YORK (AP) — Before his mother became the model for Blanche DuBois of \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" and his sister the inspiration for Laura Wingfield of \\"The Glass Menagerie,\\" Tennessee Williams drew upon a college girlfriend — if only in name — to tell a story of desire, drunkenness and regret.      FILE - This Nov. 11, 1940 file photo shows playwright Tennessee Williams at his typewriter in New York. \\"Crazy Night\\", a work of short fiction by Williams will be printed in the spring issue of The Strand... (Associated Press)      \\"Crazy Night\\" is a work of short fiction unseen by the general public until this month's release in the spring issue of The Strand Magazine, a quarterly based in Birmingham, Mich. The story is narrated by a college freshman who confides about his romance with a senior, Anna Jean. Williams, while attending the University of Missouri at Columbia, briefly dated fellow student Anna Jean O'Donnell and wrote poetry about her.      \\"It ('Crazy Night') seems to have been written when Williams was rather young, probably around the 1930s,\\" said Strand managing editor Andrew Gulli, who has previously unearthed works by Mark Twain, Joseph Heller and Robert Louis Stevenson.      \\"The funny thing is that Williams in his notebooks and memoirs went into a lot of detail about his love affairs but with Anna Jean he made only a passing mention. Could this be the missing piece of the puzzle?\\"      Gulli found the story in the University of Texas at Austin's Harry Ransom Center, one of the country's top literary archives.      \\"Crazy Night\\" is set on an unnamed campus in the early '30s, after the stock market crash of October 1929 and before the 1933 repeal of Prohibition, when \\"students graduating or flunking out of college had practically every reason for getting drunk and little or nothing that was fit to drink.\\" The title refers to a ritual at the end of spring term during which students are expected to binge on alcohol and sex, a bacchanal \\"feverishly gay\\" on the surface but \\"really the saddest night of the year.\\"      \\"There is a theme of disappointment, the old 'mendacity theme' from 'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,'\\" Gulli says. \\"He could show how beneath the cloak of respectability his characters had horrible insecurities and dark secrets. Williams was a master of showing the desperation and need humans have for companionship and was equally skilled at showing how relationships go sour and lead to cynicism.\\"      Williams was celebrated for his plays, but he wrote short stories for decades, many appearing in the 1985 anthology \\"Tennessee Williams: Collected Stories.\\" In the book's introduction, Williams' friend Gore Vidal wrote that the stories were essentially a fictionalized diary for Williams, who died in 1983.      \\"Whatever happened to him, real or imagined, he turned into prose,\\" Vidal wrote. \\"Except for occasional excursions into fantasy, he sticks pretty close to life as he experienced or imagined it. No, he is not a great short story writer like Chekhov but he has something rather more rare than mere genius. He has a narrative tone of voice that is wholly convincing.\\"      Williams' language in \\"Crazy Night\\" is sensual and romantic, with the kind of dramatic turns of phrase that Blanche DuBois might have used, whether referring to a \\"black cloud of incipient terror\\" in the narrator's mind or savoring the night air that \\"came in cool and sweet, faintly scented with a flowering vine.\\"      Even in more restrictive times, Williams wrote openly about sex, and \\"Crazy Night\\" includes a scene in which male students, most of them freshmen and virgins, are brought into a room and paired off with girls.      \\"It was handled in a very businesslike manner,\\" Williams wrote, \\"almost like vaccination the first day of school, each boy being allowed about five minutes, going in sort of white and trembling and coming out very loud and excited with a sheepish look on his face — indicating quite plainly the difference between an initial success or failure in the sexual skirmish.\\"      According to Williams' memoir, published in 1975, he and O'Donnell had a \\"poignant and innocent little affair.\\" In his poem \\"To Anna Jean,\\" he calls her a \\"well-staged play, with lights and screens,\\" a description that could have applied to Blanche and other Williams heroines. In \\"Crazy Night,\\" the narrator loses Anna Jean to another student, but not before they enjoy \\"the ultimate degree of intimacy.\\"      \\"Both her arms were lifted toward me,\\" Williams writes. \\"I had fallen between them.

Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Can you be too beautiful? It is hardly a problem that most of us have to bother -- as much as we might like to dream that it were the case. Yet the blessings and curses of beauty have been a long-standing interest in psychology. Do those blessed with shiny faces and an attractive body live in a cloud of appreciation -- or does it sometimes pay to be ordinary? Combing through decades of findings, social psychologists Lisa Slattery Walker and Tonya Frevert at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte havereviewed all the evidence to dateand their conclusions are not what you might expect. At the most basic level, beauty might be thought to carry a kind of halo  around it; we see that someone has one good quality, and by association, our deep mind may assume that they have other good ones too. Even in the courts, a pleasing appearance can work its magic. Attractive criminals are likely to get less strict sentences, or to escape punishment entirely; attractive plaintiffs , meanwhile, are more likely to win their case and get bigger financial settlements. \\"It's an effect seen everywhere,\\" says Walker. But if beauty pays in most circumstances, there are still situations where it can have opposite results. While attractive men may be considered better leaders, for instance, hidden sexist prejudices  can work against attractive women, making them less likely to be hired for high-level jobs that require power. And as you might expect, good-looking people of both sexes run into envy -- one study found that if you are interviewed by someone of the same sex, they may be less likely to employ you if they judge that you are more attractive than they are. More worryingly, being beautiful or handsome could harm your medical care. We tend to link good looks to health, meaning that illnesses are often taken less seriously when they affect the good-looking. When treating people for pain, for instance, doctors tend to take less care over the more attractive people. And the bubble of beauty can be a somewhat lonely place. One...

This, in effect, means that one entire side is now broken.

Answer the following question: I married young, at 19, bright-eyed and hopeful, and in a few months, we will celebrate our 29th anniversary. Like all marriages, we have had our share of happy and sad, growing together as the years passed us by. My husband is my best friend, a wonderful father, a hard worker, a great provider, treats me like a queen, and loves me unconditionally. He is my soul mate in many ways. My husband is also gay. I had no idea when I married him. I was a virgin on our wedding night and had never had any type of physical relationship prior to my husband. Having nothing to compare it to, I thought our sexual intimacy was normal. It was fun, sexy, enjoyable. My husband was a giving partner, and I almost always experienced orgasm. But as the years went by, the frequency of our sexual activity became less. It was not unusual to go months without sex — not for lack of trying on my part. We rarely fought, but we would fight about the growing lack of intimacy. I often wondered what it was about me that made my husband not want to have sex with me.  And then one day, shortly after our 25th anniversary, I found gay porn on his computer.  At first he denied everything, but finally, through tears, he confessed that he’d had these same-sex attractions as long as he could remember. In his teens, a church counsellor had told him marriage would “cure” him. Feeling as though I had just been punched in the gut, I was heartbroken. I felt betrayed, confused, angry, sad, and yet, miraculously relieved.  There was nothing wrong with me — I was just not his type. The emotions flew through me leaving my head and heart confused. What now? I loved this man with every fibre of my being. We had a good life together, sex aside, and had built a family. We were happy. I did not want a divorce and neither did he. Question: For how long has the husband felt attracted to the same sex? Options:  A. for several years  B. not enough information  C. since they got married  D. for as long as he can remember  === The correct answer is Answer:","output":"D. for as long as he can remember"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Review: You know you're in bad shape when the cover art of an album is actually better than the music, but that's exactly the case here. It's really quite sad to see just how bad a once great group has become. OK, Brian Wilson wasn't involved in this debacle, and it shows. There is NOTHING about this CD that has any redeeming value. The songs are just plain BAD. Horrible melodies, juvenile lyrics and overall unlistenable songs are prevelant throughout...all courtesy of Mike Love, and his cast of idiots. Even the cover songs don't work. This is without a doubt, the WORST CD in my varied and vast collection. The Beach Boys will always be a favorite band of mine, but this CD belongs in only one place...The TRASH can!! Answer: Answer:","output":"The tone of the product review is undoubtedly negative. The reviewer strongly criticizes the album and makes it clear that they believe it to be of extremely poor quality. Throughout the review, the author utilizes words and phrases that convey a negative sentiment towards the product, such as \\"Awful,\\" \\"bad,\\" \\"debacle,\\" and \\"worst CD.\\" From the title alone, \\"Awful, Awful, Awful!!!!\\", the negative tone is evident. This sets the stage for the rest of the review, which does not offer any opposing viewpoints or aspects that the reviewer appreciated. Instead, they focus their commentary on the disappointment they experienced, particularly when comparing the final result with the legacy of the band. The reviewer goes on to describe different aspects of the album which they find deeply flawed, such as the \\"horrible melodies,\\" \\"juvenile lyrics,\\" and \\"unlistenable songs.\\" These descriptions further reinforce the negative tone of the review. Additionally, the reviewer goes beyond critiquing the content of the album, assigning blame for its quality on the band members themselves, particularly Mike Love, who is described along with his collaborators as a \\"cast of idiots.\\" This personal criticism intensifies the disapproval of the album and demonstrates the strength of the author's distaste for the product. Towards the end, the author maintains their negative stance, even when discussing how much they appreciate the Beach Boys as a band. The reviewer implies that this particular album is not reflective of the band's potential and portrays it as a disappointing outlier. Concluding the review, the author states that the CD belongs in the \\"trash can,\\" a statement which clearly underlines the negative tone of the review. To summarize, the tone of this product review is undeniably negative. The disapproving language and harsh criticisms leave no room for interpretation regarding the reviewer's opinions. The reviewer does not provide any positive remarks or balance in their evaluation, only expressing disappointment and a strong aversion to this particular album."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the answer: What island do lemurs come from?","output":"Lemurs are native to the island of Madagascar, a large island off the southeastern coast of Africa. Madagascar is the fourth largest island in the world, approximately 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) long and 570 kilometers (350 miles) wide, encompassing an area of 587,041 square kilometers (226,658 square miles). The island formed around 88 million years ago when it separated from the Indian subcontinent, resulting in a unique, isolated ecosystem that fostered the development of many endemic species. As distinctive primates, lemurs can only be found in the wild on Madagascar and the nearby Comoros Islands, where they have been introduced. There are approximately 100 species and subspecies of lemurs known today, ranging from the tiny mouse lemur (Microcebus) to the large indri (Indri indri). These diverse creatures play a crucial role in the ecology of Madagascar, as they serve as both pollinators and seed dispersers. Lemurs are arboreal animals, meaning they primarily live in trees and are most active in the rainforests, deciduous forests, and spiny forests that cover Madagascar's diverse terrain. They typically feed on fruits, leaves, flowers, and other vegetation, although some species, such as the aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis), also consume insects and other small creatures. One of the most prominent features of lemurs is their social nature. Many species live in groups called troops, which are often matriarchal – females hold dominant positions over males. Lemurs use a wide range of vocalizations, scent markings, and physical gestures to communicate with each other, and they have developed complex social structures within their groups. Sadly, lemurs are considered among the most endangered mammals on the planet, mainly due to habitat loss caused by deforestation, hunting, and the illegal pet trade. Madagascar's booming human population has led to increased agricultural practices and logging, resulting in severe deforestation that puts the unique flora and fauna, including lemurs, at risk. Conservation efforts are underway to help preserve and protect Madagascar's lemurs and their habitats. National parks, such as Ranomafana and Andasibe-Mantadia, and private reserves like the Anja Community Reserve, have been established to protect Madagascar's unique biodiversity and provide tourists the opportunity to observe lemurs and other wildlife in their natural habitats. Organizations like the Lemur Conservation Foundation, Madagascar Fauna and Flora Group, and the Duke Lemur Center also contribute to lemurs' preservation through research, habitat restoration, and education programs. In conclusion, lemurs are fascinating primates that originate from the island of Madagascar and the nearby introduced populations in the Comoros Islands. Their unique characteristics, distinct social behavior, and important ecological roles make them a crucial element of Madagascar's unparalleled ecosystem. While they continue to face substantial threats, conservation efforts are ongoing to ensure the future survival of these marvelous animals."},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>.

You will simply have to look the cash machine straight in the eye, declares National Cash Registers, a multinational company that makes automated teller machines, or ATMs. NCR has shown its first example machine that is believed to be the future of banking. Instead of asking you for your PIN on a screen, the Super Teller-Stella for short, asks you orally through a loudspeaker to look straight ahead while an infrared camera turns to your head, then your eye, and finally takes an infrared photograph of your iris . For identification  purposes, an iris picture is better than a fingerprint, with around 256 noticeable characteristics compared with 40 for fingerprints. This means that the chances of someone else being recognized in your place is about 1 in 1020. Once you've been identified, Stella greets you by name and says: \\"Would you like cash or a statement?\\" An infrared port allows the machine to send a bank statement straight to your pocket computer. Question: When you want to get cash out in the 21st century, you will   _  . Yes or no, is the answer \\"just look directly at the teller machine\\"?","output":"Yes, the answer is \\"just look directly at the teller machine.\\" In the 21st century, as mentioned in the article about the Super Teller-Stella ATM by National Cash Registers (NCR), a revolutionary method of identification at ATMs is expected to replace the need for bank cards and PINs. Instead, users simply have to look straight at an infrared camera that takes a photograph of their iris for identification purposes. Iris recognition is said to be more accurate than fingerprint identification due to its higher number of noticeable characteristics – 256 compared to 40. With this advanced technology, the chances of someone being mistakenly recognized in another person's place are extremely slim – around 1 in 10^20. Once the ATM identifies the user by their iris, it greets them by name and offers options for cash withdrawal or receiving a bank statement. The statement can even be sent directly to a user's pocket computer through an infrared port built into the machine. This innovation in the banking industry aims to provide more convenience, security, and ease of use for customers accessing their bank accounts and cash."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Police arrest second suspect for murder of Boy Scout leader Police collared a second suspect late Tuesday in connection with the murder of an Anaheim, Calif., man killed after he confronted some vandals in his neighborhood — and this time, they believe they got the right man. Edgar Ramirez, 20, is now facing charges for the brutal murder of Dave Douglas earlier this month, reported the Orange County Register. Douglas, 51, a Boy Scout leader, church volunteer and active community member, was shot multiple times about 10 p.m. on July 19, after he reportedly told a group of young taggers to stop defacing a property. The first suspect, David Steven Ortega, was taken into custody on July 21, but the 32-year-old convicted felon was later released when the District Attorney’s Office refused to press charges. Investigators now say they have finally nabbed the bad guy. Authorities said they found evidence linking Ramirez to the crime, though they would not provide details. A homeless man was attacked in Anaheim Sunday — one week after Douglas’ murder — in another tagging incident gone bad. James Blue, 51, was sorting scrap metal in his pickup truck when he saw four hoodlums spraying graffiti on a building. When he told them to scram, the angry taggers beat and stabbed him. Blue survived the attack but was left paralyzed from the waist down, his wife Sandra Blue said. Anaheim authorities said they have not made a connection between the two incidents. Ramirez has a prior felony conviction, according to Orange County court records. He pleaded guilty to felony vandalism in March 2014, and pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor of disturbing school activities in November 2012.

Deen turned a cooking demo in Miami this weekend into a public apology for the racist comments that. decimated her career last year. Without ever explicitly discussing the allegations, she said she was glad to be back and that, 'I am not a. quitter' By. Associated Press. PUBLISHED:. 17:03 EST, 25 February 2014. |. UPDATED:. 18:00 EST, 25 February 2014. Paula Deen staged a comeback on Sunday which appeared to involve swigging from a tequila bottle and riding piggy-back style on the back of fellow TV chef Robert Irvine. The disgraced. Food Network star turned a cooking demo at the South Beach Wine and Food Festival in Miami this weekend into a public apology for the racist comments that. decimated her career last year. Before cooking chicken and dumplings, Deen mopped her brow and asked the. crowd if they minded if she talked about something serious for a moment. Without ever explicitly discussing the allegations or comments she has. admitted making, she said she was glad to be back and that, 'I am not a. quitter.' Scroll down for video. Celebrity chef Paula Deen was pictured swigging from a tequila bottle during a live cooking presentation for the South Beach Wine & Food Festival in Miami Beach on Sunday. Deen mops her brow as she performs a cooking demonstration of chicken and dumplings on Miami Beach on Sunday. The controversial chef, who was dropped by the Food Network and many sponsors after she made racist remarks, also hitched a ride on the back of fellow chef Robert Irvine. It was her first major public speech. since private equity firm Najafi Companies invested a reported 75 to. 100 million into new company Paula Deen Ventures earlier this month to. help the celebrity chef revitalize her career. 'We have come off of a very hard. summer my family and I, my team, my partners,' she said to a cheering. crowd of several hundred fans. 'But you know, I have heard on more than. one occasion ... that I've never apologized. So if anybody did not hear. me apologize, I would like to apologize to those who did not hear me.' The chef, known for her calorie-laden, Southern cooking, then launched into a bizarre, on-stage performance. At one point, she mentioned the rows of. empty seats in the audience, something she has never seen before at the festival she has taken part in since 2005. She also yelled out to some people. who walked out during the show: 'Hey wait were not done! Where ya'll. goin?' Paula Deen, pictured with her husband Michael Groover, made one of her first public appearances since she was disgraced in June 2013 when it was found she had used the 'N' word. Feeling the heat: The celebrity chef was dropped by her major sponsors following her use of racist language. During the cooking demo, Deen yelled out to some people who walked out during the show, 'Hey wait were not done! Where ya'll goin?' Deen's. career has been in shambles following a one-two punch of public. relations disasters. In 2012, she was criticized for announcing she had. both diabetes and a lucrative endorsement deal for a drug to treat the. condition she'd until then hidden. Then last. summer, during a legal dispute with a former employee who accused her of. racial discrimination and sexual harassment, she acknowledged having. used racial slurs, including the N-word, in the past. Most of her endorsement, book and TV. deals fell apart within days. Deen has mostly. stayed out of the spotlight since then, even avoiding the Food Network's. 20th anniversary party last October. But lately, she has made it clear. she wants back. Giddy up: Deen mounted Food Network star Robert Irvine at the South Beach Wine and Food Festival to announce her career resurgence. Earlier this month, she announced that private. investment firm Najafi Companies is investing 75 million to 100. million to help her make a comeback. As part. of the deal, she's launching an umbrella company, Paula Deen Ventures,. that will oversee her restaurants, cookbooks and product endorsements. And Sunday's crowd seemed primed for it all, shouting out to her: 'You. don't need to apologize!' and 'We want you back, Paula!' 'Ya'll's cards and letters that I got, helped me get out of bed every day' she replied. Midway. through the demo, Food Network star Robert Irvine joined Deen onstage. Paula Deen used the cooking event to make a public apology for her racist remarks last year. Finger lickin' good: Deen announced earlier this month that she would be making a comeback thanks to a 75 -100 million investment. Deen is launching an umbrella company that will oversee her restaurants, cookbooks and product endorsements. Irvine survived his own scandal in in 2008 when the Food Network let him. go over discrepancies in claims he'd made over his work experience. He. eventually returned to the Network, seemingly unblemished. 'This. is a warning to you,' Irvine told Deen. 'You've apologized. You've. eaten crow. You're done. Don't do it anymore. I've been there.' Before. a roaring crowd, Irvine then got down on his hands and knees while Deen. straddled his back and rode him across the stage, a reenactment of a. gimmick they'd done during a previous festival. 'I'm back in the saddle!' she yelled to the crowd.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: James Hudson Taylor (Chinese: Dai De Sheng ; 21 May 1832 - 3 June 1905) was a British Protestant Christian missionary to China and founder of the China Inland Mission (CIM, now OMF International). Taylor spent 51 years in China. The society that he began was responsible for bringing over 800 missionaries to the country who began 125 schools and directly resulted in 18,000 Christian conversions, as well as the establishment of more than 300 stations of work with more than 500 local helpers in all eighteen provinces. Due to health issues, Taylor remained in Switzerland, semi-retired with his wife. In 1900, Dixon Edward Hoste was appointed the Acting General Director of the CIM, and in 1902, Taylor formally resigned. His wife, Jennie, died of cancer in 1904 in Les Chevalleyres, Switzerland, and in 1905, Taylor returned to China for the eleventh and final time. There he visited Yangzhou and Zhenjiang and other cities, before dying suddenly while reading at home in Changsha. He was buried next to his first wife, Maria, in Zhenjiang, in the small English Cemetery near the Yangtze River.  The small cemetery was built over with industrial buildings in the 1960s and the grave markers were destroyed. However, the marker for Hudson Taylor was stored away in a local museum for years. His great-grandson, James Hudson Taylor III, found the marker and was able to help a local Chinese church re-erect it within their building in 1999.  His re-erected tombstone reads:  In 2013 the land for the cemetery was re-developed and the demolition of the old industrial buildings revealed that the Taylors' tombs were still intact. On 28 August the graves were excavated with the surrounding soil and moved to a local church where they will be reburied in a memorial garden.

Read this article and answer this question This was the last game the Giants would ever play at the moribund Giants Stadium, but they had no time to be nostalgic&#8212;defeating the same Week 16 opponent they faced last year would make their path to the postseason slightly easier. The Panthers, starting Matt Moore at quarterback in place of the injured Jake Delhomme, quickly took control of the game, scoring on their first four possessions (a 38-yard John Kasay field goal; a 29-yard Jonathan Stewart touchdown run; a 22-yard Muhsin Muhammad touchdown catch; and a 2-yard catch for tight end Jeff King). Meanwhile, the Giants turned the ball over 3 times in the first half, and were shut out at halftime for the second time this season. In the third quarter, Carolina picked up where they left off, as Moore connected with Carolina's Steve Smith for a 27-yard score. The Giants finally got on the board on the ensuing drive, courtesy of a 40-yard Tynes field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Giants' Smith caught a 2-yard touchdown pass from Manning, but a subsequent 2-point try failed. Carolina fullback Brad Hoover's 1-yard scoring run later in the fourth sealed the game for the Panthers. The Giants left Giants Stadium the same way they had opened it 33 years earlier; with a demoralizing loss. The loss, along with wins by the Cowboys and Packers this week, mathematically eliminated the Giants from the postseason, breaking their streak of 4 consecutive playoff appearances.

If the particles are moving slowly, these attractive forces will pull back any particles that try to escape the surface of the solution and re-enter the gas phase. However, if the gas particles are moving fast enough, these interactions will not be sufficiently strong to prevent this process from occurring.

Article: A primary school in Wuhan has used new desks and chairs to prevent students from getting short sight. The desks and chairs make students have the correct posture, especially when reading and writing. Each desk has an adjustable steel bar. The bar can help students keep their eyes at least 30cm from books. Zhang Jianming is headmaster of the primary school. She said the new desks and chairs were provided by an eye care centre in the city. The school carried out a survey last September. It showed that about 7 percent of its 1,093 students said they suffered from short sight. The new desks and chairs have already improved the students' posture, but both teachers and students might need more time to get used to them. Yang Lihua is head of the Wuhan Youth Eye Care Center. She said the desks and chairs were introduced to 19 schools on a trial basis. \\"During our research into short sight, we noticed that the number of students with short sight was increasing. This is because parents are teaching their children to read and write at a very early age without paying enough attention to their posture,\\" she said.

His involvement suggests that the film or project would carry his unique vision, creativity, and cinematic excellence, eventually creating a sense of anticipation or excitement about the final outcome. 3. \\"Convincing impersonation\\": This section of the phrase indicates that Spielberg does an excellent job embodying the role of a director, even though he may be playing or imitating another character within the film. This line implies that Spielberg's portrayal is believable and impressive. 4. \\"Director enjoying himself immensely\\": The phrase ends with the idea that Spielberg, as the director, is having a great time working on the project. This statement is positive because it reflects that the director finds the work engaging and fulfilling, which might likely result in a high-quality finished product. Moreover, when a director enjoys the process, it often fosters a positive environment for the crew and cast, possibly leading to better performances and higher engagement levels from everyone involved. In conclusion, the phrase \\"the direction of Spielberg, who does a convincing impersonation here of a director enjoying himself immensely\\" can be considered positive due to its elements that highlight the excellence and excitement associated with Steven Spielberg as a director.

De Long's party found no immediate sign at their landing-place of any human habitation, and had only a sketchy idea of where they were—Petermann's map provided few useful details. On September 19, having buried their non-essential possessions in a mound marked by a tent pole, they set out in search of settlements. Progress was hampered by the poor physical condition of the men, in particular Eriksen, who was badly affected by frostbite. On September 21 they halted at two empty huts, probably part of a hunting camp, where Alexey raised spirits by shooting a deer to replenish their dwindling food stocks. De Long allowed his exhausted party several days' rest before resuming the march.On September 28 the party found a large hut, with signs of recent occupation–edible food in the store, and moccasin tracks in the snow. When searches in the locality brought no sign of people, De Long decided to move on. By October 4, Eriksen could not continue; the party halted at another abandoned hut where, on October 6, Eriksen died. On October 9, with the condition of several men worsening, De Long decided to send two of the fittest in the group, Nindemann and Noros, to seek help. Ambler was offered the opportunity to go with them, but felt that his duty as a doctor required him to stay with the main body.For the next week De Long's party struggled on, sometimes making barely a mile a day. Although they jettisoned more of their possessions on the way, De Long insisted on carrying his maps and journals. His entry for October 10 recorded that there was \\"nothing for supper but a spoonful of glycerine\\". A few days later Alexey, the group's principal hunter, shot a ptarmigan which provided soup. But Alexey was weakening, and on October 17 he died.On October 20, trapped by the weather and without supplies, the party came to a final halt.

After leaving the army in January 1919, Grainger refused an offer to become conductor of the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra and  resumed his career as a concert pianist.  He  was soon performing around 120 concerts a year, generally to great critical acclaim, and in  April 1921 reached a wider audience by performing in a cinema, New York's Capitol Theatre. Grainger  commented that the huge audiences at these cinema concerts often showed greater appreciation for his playing than those at established concert venues such as Carnegie Hall and the Aeolian. In the summer of 1919 he led a course in piano technique at Chicago Musical College, the first of many such educational duties he would undertake in later years.Amid his concert and teaching duties, Grainger found time to re-score many of his works (a habit he continued throughout his life) and also to compose new pieces: his Children's March: Over the Hills and Far Away, and the orchestral version of The Power of Rome and the Christian Heart both originated in this period.   He also began to develop the technique of elastic scoring, a form of flexible orchestration  which enabled works to be  performed by different numbers of players and instrument types, from small chamber groups  up to full orchestral strength.In April 1921 Grainger moved with his mother to a large house in White Plains, New York. This was  his  home for the remainder of his life. From the beginning of 1922 Rose's health deteriorated sharply; she was suffering from  delusions and nightmares, and became  fearful that her illness would harm her son's career. Because of the closeness of the bond between the two, there had long been  rumours that  their relationship was incestuous;  in April 1922 Rose was directly challenged over this issue by her friend Lotta Hough.

He hosted key U.S. allies Emmanuel Macron of France and Angela Merkel of Germany; but, he also had to weather more turmoil in his Cabinet as well as the ongoing Russia investigation and intensifying scrutiny of his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. What might be an extraordinary week for another president has quickly become “situation normal” for the man elected as the nation’s 45th chief executive. Trump wound up his chaotic week Friday by meeting with German Chancellor Merkel. During an Oval Office photo opportunity, Trump was eager to embrace a report from Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee that found no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. “It was a great report. No collusion, which I knew anyway. No coordination, no nothing,” said Trump with Merkel looking on. “It is a witch hunt. That is all it is. No collusion with Russia, if you can believe this one.” Representative Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, issued a statement criticizing the Republican conclusions. Schiff asserted the committee did find evidence of collusion in “secret meetings and communications” between Trump campaign officials and others with links to the Russian government. The matter remains the focus of the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller. Earlier in the week, Trump bonded with French President Macron during a formal state visit that was noted for the warm physical interactions between the two leaders. “He is going to be an outstanding president. One of your great presidents and it is an honor to call you my friend. Thank you,” Trump told Macron at the end of their joint news conference.

On August 16, delegations from other strike committees arrived at the shipyard. Delegates (Bogdan Lis, Andrzej Gwiazda and others) together with shipyard strikers agreed to create an Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee (Międzyzakładowy Komitet Strajkowy, or MKS). On August 17 a priest, Henryk Jankowski, performed a mass outside the shipyard's gate, at which 21 demands of the MKS were put forward. The list went beyond purely local matters, beginning with a demand for new, independent trade unions and going on to call for a relaxation of the censorship, a right to strike, new rights for the Church, the freeing of political prisoners, and improvements in the national health service.Next day, a delegation of KOR intelligentsia, including Tadeusz Mazowiecki, arrived to offer their assistance with negotiations. A bibuła news-sheet, Solidarność, produced on the shipyard's printing press with KOR assistance, reached a daily print run of 30,000 copies. Meanwhile, Jacek Kaczmarski's protest song, Mury (Walls), gained popularity with the workers.On August 18, the Szczecin Shipyard joined the strike, under the leadership of Marian Jurczyk. A tidal wave of strikes swept the coast, closing ports and bringing the economy to a halt. With KOR assistance and support from many intellectuals, workers occupying factories, mines and shipyards across Poland joined forces. Within days, over 200 factories and enterprises had joined the strike committee. By August 21, most of Poland was affected by the strikes, from coastal shipyards to the mines of the Upper Silesian Industrial Area (in Upper Silesia, the city of Jastrzębie-Zdrój became center of the strikes, with a separate committee organized there, see Jastrzębie-Zdrój 1980 strikes).

If I get a job offer from a company in Sweden, but I don't have an academic degree, will that be an issue when getting a work permit? I will be honest I enjoy my subject of marketing, but have no clue what I want to do in it. I do not know whether I should get a job for a couple of years then get an MBA or if I should get an MSC in a marketing specialization. What are some opinions? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Select from: A). no. B). yes.","output":"A). No. The two questions you have asked are not the same. The first question pertains to the potential difficulties of obtaining a work permit in Sweden without an academic degree, whereas the second question focuses on determining the best choice of further academic or professional pursuits in the marketing field. Let me elaborate on the two questions in detail. 1. If I get a job offer from a company in Sweden, but I don't have an academic degree, will that be an issue when getting a work permit? It is possible to get a work permit in Sweden without an academic degree, but the process may be more challenging depending on the job you are applying for. The Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) requires that you have either a job offer or a specific job title from a Swedish employer in order to apply for a work permit. Furthermore, the employer must validate that there are no suitable candidates within Sweden or the EU/EEA for the position. In some cases, having extensive relevant experience or industry-specific certification may count in your favor, but the preference is generally given to candidates with an academic degree, especially for high-skilled positions. It is important to note that work permit requirements may vary depending on the nature of the job and the employer's demands. Multiple factors, such as your field of work, expertise, salary, and the company needing your skills, can all impact your work permit application. If you have professional experience or a unique skill set in marketing, it may still be possible for you to get a work permit without an academic degree. However, having an academic degree would increase your chances of obtaining a work permit, as it demonstrates your education background and preparedness for any given role. 2. I will be honest; I enjoy my subject of marketing, but have no clue what I want to do in it. I do not know whether I should get a job for a couple of years then get an MBA or if I should get an MSc in a marketing specialization. What are some opinions? Before making a decision, it's essential to explore the differences between an MBA program and an MSc in Marketing to better understand which program could potentially benefit you more in your future career. MBA programs are designed to provide a broad understanding of various business disciplines, such as finance, human resources, operations, and marketing. The main focus of an MBA program is to develop managerial and leadership skills, with the option to specialize in specific areas, such as marketing. MBA programs typically require prior work experience and are designed for those who want to advance in their careers, transition to a new industry or a managerial role, or even start their own business. On the other hand, an MSc in Marketing is a more specialized program focused on advanced theoretical and practical marketing concepts. This program is ideal for individuals who are passionate about marketing and wish to specialize in specific disciplines within the field, such as digital marketing, marketing analytics, or brand management. If you are unsure about the specific career path you want to take within marketing, obtaining a job and gaining some work experience before pursuing a higher degree can be beneficial. Building professional experience will help you develop a better insight into the various areas of marketing and figure out which aspects you enjoy and excel in. Additionally, work experience can help you stand out when applying to a higher degree program, as it demonstrates your practical knowledge of the marketing field. Once you've gained some experience and have a clearer understanding of where you want your career to go, you can choose between an MBA and an MSc in Marketing. If your career goals lean towards general management, leadership, or starting your own business, an MBA could be a better fit. Conversely, if your aspirations involve specialized knowledge in marketing, enrolling in an MSc program may be the more suitable choice. In conclusion, it's essential to take some time to evaluate your personal interests, strengths, and career goals in order to make an informed decision about which path is the right one for you."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Police say Jordan Deal, who survived the crash and is in fair condition, took a curve too fast. The crash occurred three days before Thanksgiving, less than a mile from the home of one of the passengers who was killed, 18-year-old John Leonard. That proximity led to poignant texts from Leonard's father, reports WFMY. \\"Where are you?\\" was the first, followed by this three minutes later: \\"John answer me right now. There has been a very serious car wreck below the church... air care is here now... I want to know it isn't you.\\" When Jeffrey Leonard got no response, he tried calling his only son—only to have the phone answered by a state trooper. Expand this summary.","output":"Authorities in North Carolina have charged 16-year-old Jordan Deal with reckless driving after an accident that led to the tragic deaths of his two friends, 18-year-old John Leonard and another victim, while leaving a third friend critically injured, according to the Dispatch of Lexington. The unfortunate crash happened less than a mile from the residence of John Leonard, one of the deceased passengers. Reports suggest that Jordan Deal, who miraculously survived the crash and is now in fair condition, was driving too fast and lost control while taking a curve. The fatal accident took place just three days before Thanksgiving, casting a somber shadow over the holiday for the families and friends of those involved. John Leonard's father, Jeffrey Leonard, sent emotional texts to his son immediately after learning about the crash that happened close to their home. His first message read, \\"Where are you?\\", as he desperately sought an answer for his son's safety. Upon not receiving a reply, Jeffrey Leonard grew more concerned, sending another text three minutes later, stating: \\"John answer me right now. There has been a very serious car wreck below the church...air care is here now...I want to know it isn't you.\\"  His worst fears were confirmed when, after receiving no response to his texts, Jeffrey Leonard tried calling his only son, and the call was answered by a state trooper instead. The heartbreaking moment marked the end of any hope he had for his son's wellbeing and signaled the start of a difficult period of grief and mourning for the Leonard family. As the community grapples with this tragic incident, its consequences will hopefully serve as a sobering reminder of the dangers of reckless driving, especially among young, inexperienced drivers. This tragic event has left a lasting impact on not only the families of the young men involved but also on the friends, classmates, and wider community who have to come to terms with the sudden loss and the reality of the dangers on the road. The accident has highlighted the importance of driving safety education and the necessity of impressing upon young drivers the severity of the consequences that can result from disregarding safety rules and driving recklessly. Various campaigns and programs aimed at raising awareness and promoting responsible driving practices can help alleviate some of the risks associated with adolescent driving. Ultimately, the tragic fate of these young men serves as a stark reminder of the importance of adhering to safe driving practices and the potentially devastating outcome that can arise from reckless driving behavior. It is crucial that driving safety is emphasized and that efforts are made to educate young drivers about the responsibility they hold when they are behind the wheel."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A: Answer:","output":"The vector sum of all the torques acting on an object is called the net torque or resultant torque. Torque, represented by the Greek letter τ (tau), is the measure of the rotational force acting on an object around a specific axis or pivot point. It is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction. The net torque is the cumulative effect of all individual torques acting on an object, taking into account their respective magnitudes and directions. Calculating the net torque involves summing up all the individual torques acting on the object. To do this, one must break down each torque vector into its components along the x, y, and z axes. The net torque can then be determined by adding up the corresponding components and constructing the resultant vector from the summed components. Mathematically, the torque τ acting at a distance r with a force F applied on the object can be expressed as: τ = r × F Here, the symbol × denotes the vector or cross product of the distance (or lever arm) vector r and the force vector F. The result of this operation is a torque vector that is perpendicular to the plane formed by the distance and force vectors. The magnitude of the torque can also be calculated using the formula: |τ| = |r| * |F| * sin(θ) where |τ| is the magnitude of the torque, |r| is the magnitude of the distance vector, |F| is the magnitude of the applied force, and θ is the angle between the distance and force vectors. To compute the net torque acting on an object, one must sum up all the individual torques: Στ_net = Σ(r × F) The net torque determines the rotational acceleration (α) of the object based on the object's moment of inertia (I) using the following equation: Στ_net = I * α According to Newton's second law of motion for rotation, the net torque acting on an object is directly proportional to the object's angular acceleration. Consequently, the net torque influences how quickly the object rotates around its designated axis, and its direction determines the rotation direction. In summary, the vector sum of all torques acting on an object, known as the net torque, has a significant impact on the rotational motion of the object. By influencing its angular acceleration and direction, the net torque is a crucial factor in understanding the dynamics of rotating systems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While traveling 35,000 feet above eastern Ohio, United 93 suddenly dropped 700 feet. Eleven seconds into the descent, the FAA's air traffic control center in Cleveland received the first of two radio transmissions from the aircraft. During the first broadcast, the captain or first officer could be heard declaring \\"Mayday\\" amid the sounds of a physical struggle in the cockpit. The second radio transmission, 35 seconds later, indicated that the fight was continuing. The captain or first officer could be heard shouting:\\" Hey get out of here-get out of here-get out of here.\\" On the morning of 9/11, there were only 37 passengers on United 93-33 in addition to the 4 hijackers. This was below the norm for Tuesday mornings during the summer of 2001. But there is no evidence that the hijackers manipulated passenger levels or purchased additional seats to facilitate their operation. The terrorists who hijacked three other commercial flights on 9/11 operated in five-man teams. They initiated their cockpit takeover within 30 minutes of takeoff. On Flight 93, however, the takeover took place 46 minutes after takeoff and there were only four hijackers. The operative likely intended to round out the team for this flight, Mohamed al Kahtani, had been refused entry by a suspicious immigration inspector at Florida's Orlando International Airport in August. Because several passengers on United 93 described three hijackers on the plane, not four, some have wondered whether one of the hijackers had been able to use the cockpit jump seat from the outset of the flight. FAA rules allow use of this seat by documented and approved individuals, usually air carrier or FAA personnel. We have found no evidence indicating that one of the hijackers, or anyone else, sat there on this flight. All the hijackers had assigned seats in first class, and they seem to have used them. We believe it is more likely that Jarrah, the crucial pilot-trained member of their team, remained seated and inconspicuous until after the cockpit was seized; and once inside, he would not have been visible to the passengers.  After reading the above, is \\"11 seconds\\" the correct answer to the question \\"How many seconds into decent was the second call?\\"?","output":"No, \\"11 seconds\\" is not the correct answer to the question \\"How many seconds into descent was the second call?\\".

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In week five, the Bears, looking to go 3-0 on the road for the first time since 2006, visited the 2-2 Carolina Panthers, the Bears having led the all-time series 5-3, and also having won the most recent meeting in 2012 23-22. The Bears had been plagued by inconsistency during the season, for example in the passing attack, with Jay Cutler, playing in his first away game with Chicago against Carolina, completing 67.5 percent in the two home games with four touchdowns and four interceptions while posting an 84.7 rating. On the road, he had completed 63.9 percent of passes with six touchdowns and no interceptions, along with a 106.3 rating. In two games against the Panthers, Cutler had thrown a touchdown and two picks with a 69.5 passer rating. The Bears had to protect Cutler from a Panthers defense that recorded 60 sacks in 2013, and despite missing Greg Hardy, featured defending Defensive Player of the Year Luke Kuechly and Star Lotulelei. However, Panthers' cornerback Antoine Cason was struggling during the year, having allowed three touchdowns. Additionally, the Panthers' had allowed 75 points the last two games, compared to 21 in the first two weeks, and while allowing an average 201.7 passing yards in the first three games, the team permitted the Baltimore Ravens' Joe Flacco to throw for 327 passing yards in their last game. On the ground, the Bears had an advantage against the Panthers' 27th-ranked rushing defense, which allowed 140.8 rushing yards per game, 264 rushing yards two games prior against the Pittsburgh Steelers, and a total 391 rushing yards in the last two games. The Bears also had a chance to capitalize on the Panthers' worst-ranked red zone offenses and defenses, with Chicago boasting a second- and sixth-ranked red zone offense and defense, respectively. The Panthers were the -2.5 favorite for the game's betting line. The Bears' inactives were Sherrick McManis, Ahmad Dixon, Shea McClellin, Roberto Garza, Charles Leno, Jr., and Jeremiah Ratliff, while Matt Slauson, D.J. Williams, and Robbie Gould were the captains. After the Bears won the toss and kicked off, the Panthers punted on their drive, and on the punt return, Santonio Holmes fumbled the ball out of bounds. The Bears would also be forced to punt, and on the return, Philly Brown was tackled by Teddy Williams before receiving the ball, and while both teams were attempting to recover the ball, Brown picked up the ball and scored on the 79-yard return. On the Bears' next drive, despite reaching the Panthers' seven-yard line, Cutler's pass for Brandon Marshall went into double coverage and was intercepted by Roman Harper, who returned the pick 44 yards to the Bears' 49-yard line, but was ruled down by challenge, and as a result, the Panthers started the drive from their own eight-yard line. Three plays later, Isaiah Frey forced Kelvin Benjamin to fumble, recovering the loose ball at Carolina's 28-yard line. The Bears would score on Cutler's ten-yard touchdown pass to Matt Forte; Chicago would then capitalize on another turnover during the Panthers' next drive: after Willie Young strip-sacked Cam Newton, Lamarr Houston recovered at Carolina's 18-yard line, and on the Bears' ensuing drive, Cutler scored on a ten-yard run, the first rushing touchdown for Cutler since 2011 and the first for the team in 2014. The Bears' next drive lasted into the second quarter, and ended with the Bears extending the score to 21-7 after Cutler threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery. The Panthers then drove to Chicago's 25-yard line, but the drive ended after Newton's pass was intercepted by a diving Lance Briggs. However, the Bears failed to take advantage of the pick, with Gould missing a 35-yard field goal. On the final drive for Carolina, Newton threw a nine-yard touchdown pass to Greg Olsen to make the score at halftime 21-14. After the Bears punted on their first drive of the second half, the Panthers reached the Bears' seven-yard line, and a penalty on Kyle Fuller moved the ball to the one-yard line, where Chris Ogbonnaya scored on a one-yard run to tie the game. Gould would give the Bears the lead again via a 45-yard field goal. The two teams exchanged punts five times in the fourth quarter, and on Chicago's third possession of the quarter, Cutler's pass for Holmes was overthrown and intercepted by Thomas DeCoud, which set up a Graham Gano 44-yard field goal. On the Bears' next play, Forte was stripped by Cason, and Kawann Short recovered. Six plays later, Cam Newton threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to Olsen to take the 31-24 lead. On the Bears' final drive, the offense faced 4th-and-21 from their own 34-yard line when Cutler fumbled while being sacked by Short, and Charles Johnson recovered. Carolina kneeled twice to end the game. The Bears had three turnovers in the fourth quarter, the second team to do so in 2014, after the New York Giants, while committing two turnovers in consecutive possessions during the fourth quarter. In comparison, the team had only one in the first four games. In the passing game, poor production on short passes led to Cutler's struggles on longer throws, completing only one of five passes of 15 yards or more during the game, including two interceptions; entering the game, he was ranked 31st of 33 quarterbacks in completion percentage for such throws with 24 percent. However, the Bears had managed to score multiple passing touchdowns against the Panthers, the fourth time this had happened to the Panthers in 2014; the Panthers had only two games allowed in 2013.

Both rivers are very important for the local economies.  But I can use this background: The major zones in river ecosystems are determined by the river bed's gradient or by the velocity of the current. Faster moving turbulent water typically contains greater concentrations of dissolved oxygen, which supports greater biodiversity than the slow moving water of pools. These distinctions form the basis for the division of rivers into upland and lowland rivers. The food base of streams within riparian forests is mostly derived from the trees, but wider streams and those that lack a canopy derive the majority of their food base from algae. Anadromous fish are also an important source of nutrients. Environmental threats to rivers include loss of water, dams, chemical pollution and introduced species. A dam produces negative effects that continue down the watershed. The most important negative effects are the reduction of spring flooding, which damages wetlands, and the retention of sediment, which leads to loss of deltaic wetlands.

Harry suggests that Marion ask for the needed cash from her psychiatrist in exchange for sex, which she does begrudgingly, and at a cost to her relationship with Harry.

Here is a news article: Monday night's board of selectmen meeting in this pastoral Connecticut River town featured a discussion on the closing of an elementary school, the awarding of a lawn care bid and a deeply polarizing debate over the meaning of the First Amendment.      The conflict was set off at a board meeting earlier this month when Democratic Selectwoman Melissa J. Schlag knelt during the Pledge of Allegiance to protest President Donald Trump's defense of Russian leader Vladimir Putin, his hardline on undocumented immigrants and other policies put forth by the Republican president.      Her stance, which echoes the public dissents of NFL players, drew harsh condemnation from critics, including several Republican gubernatorial candidates, and a spirited defense from supporters.      On Monday, the first board meeting after the controversy, both sides came to the Haddam Volunteer Firehouse as the minutia of small town government gave way to an impassioned display reflecting the cultural and political fault lines of the Trump era.      \\"This is political speech,'' Paul White, a 49-year-old local attorney, said over jeers from some in the audience. 'Whether I agree or not it doesn't matter. She has the right … to convey a political message.\\"      But Calvin Bunnel, 71, came from Meriden to express his anger at Schlag's silent protest. \\"You don't turn your back on the flag,'' he said. He wore a T-shirt emblazoned with the message, \\"If you don't like this flag, I'll help you pack your bags.\\"      I did not go to Vietnam … to pick and choose who gets to be better Americans. — Bob Wallin, Haddam      Bunnel served in Vietnam and, like many other veterans in the audience, views kneeling during the pledge as a sign of profound disrespect to those who served in the military.      \\"I wholeheartedly respect your right to protest, to take a knee,'' said Pablo Arroyo, a 58-year-old town resident who served in the Marine Corps. \\"But if that's what you would like to do, do it on your own time. I am not here to disrespect you as you've done to my flag, my country.\\"      Arroyo recalled 18 Marines in his platoon who were killed in a suicide bombing in Beruit. Looking directly at Schlag, he said: \\"What you did was urinate on all their graves.\\"      But not all of the veterans in the audience took the same view. Bob Wallin, a 71-year-old town resident and a combat veteran who served in Vietnam, delivered a poignant defense of Schlag's constitutional right to peacefully protest.      Editorial: Politely Kneeling Is As Respectful As Protest Gets, Haddam Selectwoman Owed An Apology »      \\"I took an oath to defend the Constitution,'' Wallin said. \\"The Constitution starts with the First Amendment. She has that right. I'm not agreeing with her and I think the reason she does it is stupid. I don't care.\\"      Wallin said he was exposed to Agent Orange and is suffering the effects of that exposure. As he offered up his brief comments, he grew too weak to stand and was given a chair and a bottle of water.      \\"I did not go to Vietnam … to pick and choose who gets to be better Americans,'' Wallin declared. Speaking to the politicians who have denounced Schlag, he said \\"Screw you. None of you earned that right … you people make me mad.\\"      Instead of expressing outrage at Schlag on social media, Wallin implored the crowd to turn its anger toward helping veterans. \\"You want to be upset right on Facebook? Well, two veterans a day commit suicide,'' he said.      Before the meeting started, Schlag's critics, led by Republican gubernatorial candidate Tim Herbst and Republican candidate for state treasurer Art Linares, held a rally on the town green. As Lee Greenwood's conservative anthem, \\"God Bless the U.S.A.,'' blared from speakers, a crowd of about 75 — including a few in “Make America Great Again” hats and Trump T-shirts — came together to stand for the flag.      \\"It's completely disrespectful,'' said Linares, a state senator whose district includes Haddam.      Linares invoke his grandfather, who was jailed for standing up to Fidel Castro before fleeing Communist Cuba. \\"This flag, our flag, represents the freedoms that make this country so great,'' he said, \\"and he would have been so disappointed and sad to see what happened at that selectmen's meeting.\\"      About a quarter of a mile away, on the long road leading to the firehouse, another crowd of about 75 gathered to stand in solidarity with Schlag. Several people donned black and put tape over their mouths to symbolize what they said were attempts to silence the selectwoman. A few wore T-shirts identifying themselves as members of the Trump resistance; others were dressed in Hillary Clinton campaign swag.      \\"Seeing one of our selectmen being attacked for exercising her rights, and seeing Republicans campaign off it to rile up their base, I thought it was important to be here,'' said Aubrey Bingham, 35, of Haddam.      Schlag isn’t the only Connecticut River Valley elected official to take a knee during the Pledge of Allegiance.      For the past year and a half, two members of the Region 17 school board — Democrat Eric Couture of Killingworth and Republican Maura Wallin of Haddam — have silently taken a knee while the pledge was recited.      But for some reason, Schlag's protest set off a storm of controversy. Monday's meeting drew more than 150 people to the firehouse on a steamy July night. At the start, Schlag once again knelt as the other board members recited the pledge with hands over their hearts.      \\"Did you kneel during the Obama administration?'' someone in the audience yelled at one point.      At the end of the hourlong public comment period, Schlag addressed the audience and made a plea for civility.      \\"I have a right to free speech,'' she said. \\"You have a right to dislike me. But please don't put words in my brain or thoughts in my brain. I mean no disrespect to any veteran.\\"      As she spoke, some in the audience knelt in support while others turned their heads or their backs to her. Others walked out.      “I appreciate everyone coming out because this is truly town government at its best,'' Schlag said. \\"We need to continue the conversation or hate will continue to fester. We need to rip the bandage off. We can't wrap our sins in a flag and expect it to be OK.\\"      CAPTION Megan Ahern, business analyst for Nutmeg State Financial Credit Union, demonstrates the computerized check-in kiosk for driver’s license renewals to be performed in the credit union’s new Milford branch office, starting Thursday, under a contract with the state Department of Motor Vehicles.

(AP) — A town official opposed to President Donald Trump's policies took a knee during the Pledge of Allegiance at a tense meeting packed with more than 100 people, dividing community residents and furthering an intense debate over protests and the First Amendment.      Haddam Selectwoman Melissa Schlag faced jeers while she kneeled during the pledge on Monday and asked residents and politicians to not add words to her \\"silent protest.\\"      \\"I appreciate everyone coming out because this is truly town government at its best,\\" Schlag, a Democrat, said after the demonstration. \\"We need to continue the conversation or hate will continue to fester.\\"      Haddam resident Marine Pablo Arroyo told Schlag she should protest on her own time.      \\"I am not here to disrespect you as you've done to my flag, my country,\\" Arroyo said.      Vietnam veteran and town resident Bob Wallin, who supported Schlag's right to protest, said no one has a right to tell her how and when to exercise free speech.      Before the meeting, about 100 people organized by Republican governor's race candidate Tim Herbst and state Sen. Art Linares rallied in the town, which has about 8,000 residents, to call Schlag's protest disrespectful. A crowd of about 75 rallied in a different part of town in support of Schlag's protest.      Schlag said she began kneeling during the pledge earlier this month to protest Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, his hard-line stance on immigration and other policies. Trump, a Republican, has said his immigration policies and his plan to build a wall along the Mexican border are meant to keep the United States safe.      Schlag said she has no plans to seek higher office. She said she has received harassment and threats over her protest and calls for her resignation. ||||| Alyssa Hurlbut / CTMirror.org      The quaint town of Haddam was transformed Monday evening into the front line of a political battle over free speech as protesters packed a routine Board of Selectmen meeting to register their opinions about the selectwoman who garnered national attention by kneeling during the Pledge of Allegiance.      Since quietly protesting the Trump administration during the July 16 Board of Selectman’s meeting by taking a knee during the pledge, Melissa Schlag has awakened an outcry from both residents and Republican candidates running for statewide offices.      In the garage of the town’s volunteer fire station Monday night, where Schlag joined her fellow selectmen and an audience of about 100 residents, the politician knelt once again during the reciting of the Pledge of Allegiance while people in the audience stared her down or yelled the words to the oath in defiance.      One veteran denounced Schlag’s actions, awakening a standing ovation from the rowdy audience spilling out the doors of the room.      “One day… I lost 18 of [my platoon] in a suicide bombing. What you did was urinate all over their graves,” Pablo Arroy yelled at Schlag, who sat quietly at the selectmens’ table facing the crowd.      Not all veterans were critical of Schlag, however. A Vietnam War veteran nearly lost his breath, necessitating a chair and water, after delivering a passionate “screw you”-ridden speech to those criticizing Schlag. He was met by a ripple of “boo’s” and “get off the stage.”      The veterans were just two of the many citizens who dedicated their Monday evening to either denounce the selectwoman and her silent protest or defend her right to kneel.      Moments before the meeting, a cluster of citizens decked out in black attire lined the doors of the fire station. Armed with signs advocating the First Amendment, the group remained planted on the grass, many wearing black tape over their mouths, for nearly two hours.      Advertisement      Alyssa Hurlbut / CTMirror.org      A few minutes down the road at the town green, a more colorful army led by state Sen. Art Linares, R-Westbrook, and Republican gubernatorial candidate Tim Herbst joined in singing — indeed, bellowing — the words to God Bless America over two loud speakers blasting patriotic songs.      “I knew that when the selectman took a knee, it didn’t reflect the views of the people in this town,” Linares said. “I don’t want to see others take a knee during the Pledge of Allegiance, and this was our way of putting a stop to it.”      Schlag waited until the end of the public comment portion of the meeting to make a statement.      “We can’t wrap our sins in a flag and expect it to be okay,” she said, as people in the crowd turned their backs as she spoke.      The clashing demonstrations were just two of the events organized in response to Schlag’s actions. Following a week and a half of backlash, a group of Haddam residents coordinated a pro-flag rally last Friday, lining the streets of the town with more than 1,000 American flags.      Schlag, a Democrat, said she kneeled to protest President Donald Trump’s recent meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin and the Trump administration’s immigration policies.      Her small protest before no more than two dozen residents lasted a total of about 10 seconds, but it has been echoing in state politics ever since.      “What has happened is completely disrespectful,” said Linares, who is facing an Aug. 14 primary for the GOP nomination for state treasurer. Linares was the first state politician to denounce Schlag.      Linares issued a July 23 press release, calling on Schlag to “immediately apologize to Haddam residents who are offended by her lack of respect.” He followed up later that same day with a Twitter video, this time escalating his criticism to a full fledged call to action, urging Schlag to step down as selectwoman.      But the fall-out didn’t end there.      By July 25, Herbst, who is in a 5-way primary for the GOP nomination, was denouncing Schlag and calling for her resignation from a much more visible perch — the set of FOX & Friends, a daily morning conservative news/talk program on Fox News Channel.      “She needs to resign immediately. One of the things our flag stand for, it stands for our freedom. It stands for our democracy. It stands for the fundamental ideal that we can have differences of opinion. But we all stand in respect of our flag. Many people, including my 93-year-old grandfather, was a veteran, fought in defense of the very liberties that flag resembles,” Herbst said during the show.      After hearing of one another’s intersecting efforts, Herbst and Linares joined forces to organize a protest denouncing Schlag outside the town hall building Monday.      “As the Senator from this district, I wanted to put an end to it,” Linares said. “ I don’t want others in this town and in my district think it’s okay to take a knee.”      Both the demonstrations persisted for about two hours, until Schlag entered the Fire House for the first board meeting since the July 16 event. She was joined by First Selectman Liz Milardo and Second Selectman Larry Maggi, both of whom publicly denounced her protest.      In the wake of her kneeling, Schlag said she had received an outpouring of responses that range from support to threats. She called the statements of the Republican politicians “disgusting.”      Advertisement      “Any candidate that tells a citizen of the U.S. that they don’t have a voice should resign and doesn’t belong in our government,” she said. “Through their political motivation, they are trying to silence the people by taking away our First Amendment rights for political gain.”      She added that her protest was not an act of disrespect for the flag but rather “a silent cry for our country to be better.”      “The intention of my silent protest was the bring the injustices of our country to the forefront,” she said. “The loud wave of ugly attacks on our basic rights set forth under the constitution shows just how much we have to lose.”      As long as Donald Trump is president of the United States, Schlag says she will continue to kneel.      On Monday evening, she did just that, this time before a much more adrenalized audience. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"In Haddam, a small town in Connecticut, a town official named Melissa Schlag knelt during the Pledge of Allegiance to protest President Donald Trump's policies.

Followers, whose weight fell as low as 35kg, said to have been manipulated into following eating regime      A well-known guru of macrobiotic food who met Pope Francis is among the five people under investigation in Italy after police dismantled a bizarre “sect” that allegedly denied its followers contact with the outside world.      Mario Pianesi, the 73-year-old founder of a group in the central Marche and Emilia-Romagna regions of Italy, and his wife, Loredana Volpi, are suspected of being the ringleaders of a network that manipulated victims into following a strictly controlled diet known as “Ma-Pi”.      Authorities said Pianesi convinced followers of the diet, modelled on the teachings of the Japanese philosopher George Ohsawa, that it would provide miracle cures for their illnesses and that traditional medicine did not work. It aims to avoid foods containing toxins and is based on whole grains, vegetables and beans.      Carlo Pinto, an Ancona police chief, told the Guardian that the victims were so devoted to the diet and their “teacher” that the sect managed to coerce them into giving donations and working for free in the association’s macrobiotic centres and restaurants. The diet was so destructive that the weight of one follower plunged to 35kg (77lb).      “I’ve never come across a case like it in my life,” Pinto said. “These were people suffering from physical or mental illnesses. They were convinced that the diet did them good and in return they offered to help the macrobiotic food chain, working for free and effectively sacrificing their own life.”      Pianesi, Volpi and three others are being investigated for alleged maltreatment, tax evasion and criminal organisation with the aim of reducing people to slavery.      The inquiry began in 2013 after a young woman told police Pianesi promised her that the diet would cure her illness. Pinto said there were eight victims, whose illnesses instead worsened, but he expected more to come forward.      “Pianesi would say that doctors were assassins, traditional medicine didn’t work and that only he could help,” said Pinto.      Pianesi, who along with his wife attended a mass with Pope Francis in 2016 followed by a private meeting with the pontiff, was “well respected” in Italy and “dominated” the macrobiotic industry, Pinto added.      Originally from Albania, Pianesi started his empire in Marche in 1980 and went on to cultivate a business that claimed to help cure illnesses including diabetes.      He once claimed that 26 scientific journals had endorsed the Ma-Pi diet as a tool for the prevention and treatment of chronic illnesses. He also boasted of having collaborated with UN agencies including the Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). His popularity is such that he is an honorary citizen of 12 towns in Italy and across the world. ||||| Italian police said on Wednesday they had smashed a “macrobiotic sect” run by a 73-year-old guru and businessman who allegedly reduced followers to slavery by rigidly controlling their diets and denying them contact with the outside world.      Fourteen people were arrested in the Marche region of central Italy and five placed formally under investigation on suspicion of running a criminal gang tied to slavery, mistreatment and tax evasion, judicial sources said.      Investigators began an inquiry in 2013 when a young girl in the town of Forli denounced to police promises by the guru that his diet could miraculously heal otherwise incurable illnesses, police said.      Those under investigation included guru Mario Pianesi, 73, his wife Loredana Volpi, 51, and two other collaborators, police said. Followers allegedly were manipulated to follow a rigidly controlled five-stage diet called “Ma.Pi.,” coined after the name of their leader.      The weight of one female follower was reduced to as little as 35kg (77lb), though she had no weight problems beforehand, police sources said. ||||| Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A strict macrobiotic diet tends to rely heavily on whole grains such as brown rice      Police in Italy say they have broken up a \\"psycho sect\\" that enslaved members by forcing them to adhere to a strict macrobiotic diet and cut off contact with the outside world.      Five people are under investigation over allegations including maltreatment and tax evasion.      Among the suspects is a business mogul who is accused of manipulating followers of the diet he created.      Mario Pianesi reportedly told them that Ma.Pi. would provide miracle cures.      The investigation started in 2013 after a young woman left the sect and denounced its head to police.

Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities. That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes. A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos. True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn's penthouse. Several weeks later he was asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management. Thus began Hughes' legendary three-year, 300-million Las Vegas buying spree. When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains. Hughes' actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting. Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes' investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant. That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city. Las Vegas with a Vision As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out, a new Las Vegas emerged. The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US. What was once a sure thing became much more competitive. Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business. The first to really do so was Steve Wynn, a Las Vegas resident and owner of the Golden Nugget. In the mid-1980s, Wynn began plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort.

Over the centuries, the living here has always been easy enough to attract a steady stream of immigrants. Bountiful food sources might have made Malaysia an inviting place for the contemporaries of Java Man — in 230,000 b.c. But thus far, the country's earliest traces of homo sapiens, found in the Niah Caves of northern Sarawak, are fragments of a skull dating to 40,000 b.c. On the peninsula, the oldest human-related relics (10,000 b.c. ) are Stone Age tools of the Negritos. These small, dark Melanesians are related in type to Australian aborigines and are confined today to the forests of the northern highlands. By 2,000 b.c. , these timid, gentle nomads hunting with bow and arrow were driven back from the coasts by waves of sturdy immigrants arriving in outrigger canoes equipped with sails. Mongolians from South China and Polynesian and Malay peoples from the Philippines and the Indonesian islands settled along the rivers of the peninsula and northern Borneo. They practiced a slash-and-burn agriculture of yams and millet, a technique that exhausted the soil and imposed a semi-nomadic existence from one jungle clearing to another. Families lived in wooden longhouses like those still to be seen today among the Iban peoples of Sarawak. Another unit was added on to the communal dwelling each time a marriage created a new family. Other tough migrants from the South Seas settled along the coasts — sailors, fishermen, traders (for the most part pirates) — known euphemistically as orang laut (sea people).

Partial pressure is the pressure exerted by an individual gas component within a gaseous mixture when it is present among other gases. It can be calculated using Dalton's Law of partial pressures, which states that the total pressure of a gaseous mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of its individual gas components. Vapor pressure is the pressure exerted by a vapor that is in equilibrium with its corresponding liquid in a closed system. This equilibrium occurs when the rate of evaporation of the liquid is equal to the rate of condensation of the vapor. Vapor pressure depends on the temperature and the nature of the substance.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Once again, I've analysed my year of travel to see if I'm any closer to reducing it year on year. It's an annual habit, and if often kicks off new ideas that might affect my team's next year of work. The good answer is: yes, there is less travel! And not just that, but having reduced the schlepping I do, I've been able to hire more amazing people to lead on our work, and celebrate one of NoTosh's best years ever in terms of the quality, quantity and breadth of work we're doing. Key to traveling less has been a marked increase in the number of folk who see and are now reaping the value of working with us online. I've avoided as many as 20,000 miles of travel thanks to greener clients, who are also many dollars better off having not paid for the airmiles that are wrapped up in our regular fee structure. The quality of our work is better, too, thanks to this. We are doing fewer of those day-long workshops with teachers or leaders, when an hour or even thirty minutes before the day gets started is more worthwhile. We're seeing more school leaders take this up, although it's harder to get teachers into the habit of taking 30 minutes 'me time' to jump into a coaching session on the day or week ahead. But it's starting, and the value to us all is huge. Coaching is very different to 'consulting a Personal Learning Network' on Twitter. It's intense, targeted, focussed and involves a one-on-one discussion that arrives quickly at resolutions to current day challenges that will have a long-term impact. And we come back to measure whether that impact actually happened. I don't think it's a way of working that many are used to in Education, although many corporate clients have had some rare experience with it. Encouraging both groups to take more regular time out for coaching, little and often, is a real challenge, but we're beginning to see some huge impact from relatively little input (and relatively few dollars!).

Process: - Oil is gathered through mining operations - The oil is transported to stores - Oil is purchased by homeowners - Oil is placed into a stove in the house - The oil is lit on fire, and burns for a long time - The warm air off of the oil travels through the house -   Question: suppose people care more about climate change happens, how will it affect more oil placed in a stove.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"If people care more about climate change, it will have a \\"less\\" effect on more oil being placed in a stove. Step-by-step justification: 1. As people become more concerned about climate change, they seek to reduce their carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions. 2. Since burning oil contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental pollution, these individuals will start looking for alternative, eco-friendly heating options. 3. With more people adopting alternative heating solutions (such as solar panels, heat pumps, or electric stoves), the overall demand for oil will decrease. 4. The reduced demand for oil will lead to less oil being gathered through mining operations and transported to stores. 5. As a result, fewer homeowners will purchase oil for their stoves. 6. Ultimately, there will be less oil being placed into stoves, which in turn means that the warm air generated by burning oil will be reduced in the house. 7. This perturbation in people’s concern about climate change, therefore, has a \\"less\\" effect on more oil being placed in stoves and, consequently, a \\"less\\" effect on the propagation of warm air generated in the process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices:  - physical  - radiation  - carbon  - chemical  A: The answer to this question is:","output":"- Chemical When wood is burned, the energy that enables the process is chemical energy. Wood is primarily composed of organic compounds, such as cellulose and lignin, which store energy in the form of chemical bonds. When wood is exposed to heat, a process called combustion, or burning, occurs. Combustion is a chemical reaction where the organic compounds in wood react with oxygen in the air to produce heat, light, carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gaseous products.  During combustion, the chemical bonds in the organic compounds within wood are broken, and new bonds are formed with oxygen. The process releases the stored chemical energy as heat and light, which are forms of thermal and electromagnetic energy, respectively. Although radiation is associated with the light and heat produced during combustion, it is not the primary energy source that allows wood to burn.  In summary, it is the chemical energy stored within the organic compounds in wood that enables burning to occur. This energy is transformed, released, and utilized as thermal and electromagnetic energy when combustion starts and proceeds."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Who was the President of Argentina when it invaded the Falklands in 1982?","output":"Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri was the President of Argentina when the country invaded the Falkland Islands in 1982. Galtieri served as Argentina's President from December 22, 1981, until June 18, 1982, following a long history of playing a crucial role in military and political affairs in Argentina. Galtieri was an Argentine army general and a key figure in the National Reorganization Process (Proceso de Reorganización Nacional), a military junta that ruled Argentina from 1976 to 1983. He became the 45th president of Argentina after a coup that overthrew President Roberto Eduardo Viola. Galtieri was the third and penultimate leader within the junta during its existence. The background of the Falklands crisis involves a longstanding territorial dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom over the Falkland Islands, South Georgia, and South Sandwich Islands. The dispute had persisted since the 19th century, and Galtieri's government saw the opportunity to regain control of the disputed territories. This decision was partly fueled by the idea that retaking these islands would help consolidate Galtieri's domestic power and distract from the country's political and economic crises. The Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands (known as the Islas Malvinas in Spanish) took place on April 2, 1982. The attack caught the United Kingdom by surprise, and the British government, led by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, quickly launched a military expedition to reclaim the islands. The conflict, known as the Falklands War, lasted for 74 days and resulted in the deaths of 655 Argentine military personnel, 255 British military personnel, and three Falkland Islanders. The British forces successfully defeated the Argentine military and reclaimed the Falkland Islands in mid-June 1982. Argentina's failure in the Falklands War led to widespread civil unrest and protests against Galtieri's government. The disillusionment with military rule contributed to the eventual collapse of the junta and the return to a democratic government in Argentina in 1983. As a result of the defeat in the Falklands War and mounting pressure from the Argentine public, Galtieri was removed from the presidency on June 18, 1982. He was later arrested and imprisoned for human rights abuses committed during Argentina's \\"Dirty War,\\" a period characterized by state terrorism and forced disappearances of political dissidents.

Josh gives chase and almost catches him when he is clotheslined by FBI agent Claire Denham. Denham explains that Shaw wasn't being kidnapped, he was attempting to flee arrest, accused of running a Ponzi scheme. Josh tells the Tower staff about Shaw's arrest and explains that he gave Shaw their pension fund to invest, and their money is gone. Josh, Charlie and Enrique visit Shaw, under house arrest in his penthouse apartment. Josh tells Shaw that Lester attempted suicide after losing everything he had.

We asked Zolezzi about who he admires, his biggest failure, and life at home. Fortune: What green business or person do you admire most? Why? Zolezzi: Two: Lee Scott, former CEO of Wal-Mart WMT , and Paul Polman, current CEO of Unilever UL , because they are truly walking the walk as it relates to sustainability, and I can’t leave out Elon Musk [of Tesla Motors tsla ] who is showing us that energy efficiency can be sexy and profitable. What other companies do you admire? I love simple disruptive models — extreme examples on two ends of a spectrum would be Uber and Apple AAPL or Whole Foods WFM and Amway. What is the best advice you ever received? Always separate the institution from the personality. What would you do if you weren’t working at your current job? At Pegasus Capital, my current job is putting people and companies together with the resources, strategy, and insights to have a major impact on the health of individuals, communities, and the environment.

Mori trains his grandchildren in the art of Ninjutsu. As the summer comes to an end, Mori gives each of them a new \\"ninja\\" name based on their personalities: 'Rocky', 'Colt', and 'Tum-Tum'.  Meanwhile, the boys' father, Sam Douglas, is an FBI agent who stages a sting operation to entrap Hugo Snyder in the sale of warheads. Snyder escapes the trap with the use of his own ninja henchmen. Snyder decides to test Mori's fighting skill. The boys ignore Mori's orders to stay in the house and aid by defeating two ninjas on their own. Snyder threatens Mori's family if he doesn't get Douglas off his back, and Mori chides the boys briefly for interfering in his personal affairs. When they return home, they find their father unenthusiastic to see what they had learned during their visit and more annoyed at their new names. Emily, a friend of Rocky's, compliments his new name and agrees to ride with them to school the next day. Snyder develops a plan to kidnap the boys to use them as leverage to get Douglas to back off.

Q:The answer to the question: What government position was held by the man who was interviewed on television about the operation that did not have official acknowledgement of special forces? is inside the article: One British soldier, Bradley Tinnion, was killed in the operation. Another twelve soldiers were injured, one seriously. The British Ministry of Defence (MoD) did not officially acknowledge the involvement of special forces, issuing a press release which made no mention of the SAS, but when it was made public that Brad Tinnion was a Lance Bombardier originally from 29 Commando Regiment Royal Artillery, it became clear to experts that Tinnion had been serving with special forces. Operation Barras was Tinnion's first operational deployment as an SAS trooper.Also confirmed to have died in the operation were 25 West Side Boys, although the true figure is probably far higher. The gang's resistance was stronger than had been expected and there was speculation that more bodies lay undiscovered in the jungle. Several other West Side Boys were captured, while others fled into the jungle. Many of those who fled later surrendered to Jordanian peacekeepers. The Jordanians had received 30 by the end of the day, and 371—including 57 children—had surrendered within a fortnight of Operation Barras, to which Julius Spencer, Sierra Leone's Minister for Information, declared that the West Side boys were \\"finished as a military threat\\". Some of those who surrendered went on to volunteer for the new Sierra Leone Army and those who were accepted went into the British-run training programme. Kallay, the gang's leader, recorded a message for broadcast on Sierra Leonean radio urging the remaining West Side Boys to surrender to UNAMSIL. He also identified the bodies of West Side Boys killed in Magbeni and Gberi Bana, which were subsequently buried in a mass grave.The morning of the operation, General Sir Charles Guthrie, Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS)—the professional head of the British Armed Forces—was coincidentally due to appear on Breakfast with Frost, a Sunday morning political television programme hosted by Sir David Frost.

A plunger with a simple rubber cup attached to a wooden handle is the best tool for the job. If you have a flange plunger with an extra ring of rubber around the bottom, fold the extra ring into the cup. The plunger will bring up whatever is clogging the drain. Don't use a plunger if you've poured toxic chemicals like bleach down the drain, as it will bring these up, too. They can splash and cause burns. If you have an overflow drain in your tub, this can break the suction created with a plunger. Make sure it is completely closed off by covering it with a wet towel. The outside of the drain may be wet from a recent shower. If it is not evenly wet, pour some water into the tub. Or, use a small amount of petroleum jelly around the edge of the cup of the plunger to get a better seal. If there is a lot of standing water in your tub, remove some of it with a bucket before you start to plunge. This will keep it from splashing you.  The cup will seal when you start to pump. Move the handle up and down a few times to force air out. Then push vigorously for about 20 seconds. Don't push so hard that you break the seal. If the plunging worked, it will have brought up whatever was clogging your drain. Remove the clog with your hands or use a wire snake if you can't reach it. Use a flashlight to get a good look. To check that everything has been cleared out, turn on the water and watch to see if it drains. If the water doesn't drain, try using a hand snake or baking soda and vinegar solution. Summary:","output":"The article provides an instructional guide on effectively using a rubber-cup plunger to unclog drains by creating a seal, maneuvering the handle, and removing the clog, while also cautioning against certain potential hazards such as splashing of toxic chemicals, breaking the suction, and ensuring complete removal of the clogs."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Barra McGrory also promised RHI witness evidence will not be used in deciding whether to take such a criminal case. Chairman Sir Patrick Coghlin asked for this, to ensure witnesses could not use legal protections on self-incrimination to frustrate the inquiry's work. The public inquiry was set up in January to investigate the operation of a botched green energy scheme. The aim of the RHI initiative was to encourage businesses and other non-domestic users to move from using fossil fuels towards renewable heating systems. However, a lack of cost controls and overly generous payments led to a financial scandal which brought down Northern Ireland's power-sharing government. News of Mr McGrory's witness evidence guarantee came as the RHI inquiry held its second public session. The commitment covers witness statements, oral evidence and any document produced solely by that person to the inquiry. However, it does not cover anyone who gives false testimony. Sir Patrick said his intention now was to begin hearing oral evidence in the first two weeks of October. The chairman also outlined the huge task facing the inquiry. To date, his team has processed 320,000 pages of documents - the equivalent of approximately 1,000 lever arch files - much of it relating to email chains. Sir Patrick said statements from some witnesses ran to more than 100 pages. He added that was an indication of \\"just how seriously many of those involved are treating their engagements with the inquiry\\". Sir Patrick was unable to provide an estimate of the total number of as yet unprocessed documents received by his team, but said it was the equivalent of 13 gigabytes of computer memory. The chairman has issued 320 summons to individuals and organisations asking them to produce evidence. Some have received more than one. These include government departments, politicians, civil servants and special advisors. In addition, 1,058 recipients of RHI subsidy have been written to, asking for co-operation in respect of relevant information. About 80 of them have replied. Sir Patrick said the information his team received from the claimants had opened up further lines of investigation. The retired Appeal Court judge was appointed to chair the public inquiry in January, by Northern Ireland Executive ministers before the collapse of the assembly. The financial controversy - dubbed the \\"cash-for-ash scandal\\" - engulfed Stormont late last year. DUP leader Arlene Foster set up the RHI scheme in 2012, in her then role as Stormont's enterprise minister. However, flaws in the design of the scheme led to accusations that the more fuel claimants burned, the more cash they earned. A whistleblower claimed the subsidy scheme was being abused, with claims that one farmer aimed to collect about £1m over 20 years for heating an empty shed - fuelling \\"money-to-burn\\" claims. It was never proven. Earlier this year, it was projected that more than £1bn of public money was to due to be paid out by the UK government over the next 20 years - with £490m coming from Stormont's block grant. Cost controls have since been introduced for 2017/18 which will greatly reduce that amount, but RHI recipients who will lose out are set to challenge cost-cutting measure in the courts later this year. Under mounting public pressure in January, the late Sinn Féin's Martin McGuinness resigned as deputy first minister of Northern Ireland in protest at the DUP's handling of the investigation. His party had demanded that Mrs Foster step aside temporarily as first minister to allow an inquiry to begin, and when she refused, he quit. The joint nature of their office meant that when he resigned his post, she also lost her job, and the secretary of state had to call a snap assembly election in March. Sir Patrick is leading a three-person panel which has promised to conduct a thorough investigation into the design and operation of the RHI scheme, including efforts to implement cost controls. At the time of his appointment, the chairman said: \\"Rest assured every stone will be turned and there will be no dark corners where the light won't shine.\\" The other panel members assisting him are Dame Una O'Brien, a former Permanent Secretary of the UK Department of Health, and Keith MacLean, chair of the energy UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC). Their aim is to establish the facts, the inquiry has no power to determine any person's criminality or civil liability. What is a summary of this text?","output":"The Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) public inquiry in Northern Ireland received assurances that its hearings will not impact a potential criminal investigation into the green energy scandal.

The inquiry, which has led to the collapse of the country’s power-sharing government, will examine the operation of the initiative, which was designed to encourage businesses to use renewable heating systems.

He led the Baltimore Colts to NFL championships in 1958 and 1959 and the New York Jets to victory in Super Bowl III in 1969. He is the only coach to win a championship in both the National Football League (NFL) and American Football League (AFL). Ewbank moved back to Oxford in retirement and wrote a book in 1977 called Football Greats. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1978, but said later that year that he was glad to be out of coaching. With the expansion of the NFL, he said, talent had become diluted and fielding a good team was difficult. Coaches, meanwhile, customarily took the blame for a team's failures, and the sport had become too violent.  Ewbank's coaching style was laid-back but efficient, combining his mild personality with an orderliness inherited from Paul Brown. \\"Weeb combined a low-key style with a flair for the most dramatic of accomplishments\\", former NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said in 1998. \\"He led two of the legendary teams during the era of pro football's greatest growth. But he preferred to stay in the background and let the players take the credit.\\" He favored well-practiced execution of a limited number of plays over complicated offensive and defensive systems. Paul Brown \\"had the exact same approach: Don't do too much, but what you do, execute it flawlessly\\", Raymond Berry said in 2013, adding that the Colts' 1958 championship team had only six passing plays.  Ewbank is the only man to coach two professional football teams to championships, and the only man to win the NFL championship, the AFL championship and a Super Bowl. Ewbank's regular-season career record in the NFL and AFL was 130-129-7, and his playoff record was 4-1. Ewbank was selected as the head coach on the AFL All-Time Team in 1970. In addition to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, he was inducted into the Miami University Athletic Hall of Fame in 1969, the Indiana Football Hall of Fame in 1974 and the Talawanda School District Athletic Hall of Fame in 1999. He also won the Walter Camp Distinguished American Award in 1987 and was inducted into the Jets' Ring of Honor in 2010.  Ewbank suffered a dislocated hip in the aftermath of the Jets' 1968 AFL championship game win, and had other health issues in his later years. He broke his leg and had two hip replacements in the 1990s. He also had myasthenia in his right eye. Ewbank died at 91 on November 17, 1998, the 30th anniversary of the \\"Heidi Game\\", after suffering from heart problems. He and his wife Lucy had three daughters.

The Raiders struggled from the outset, allowing the Cowboys to drive inside Raider territory before Sean Smith intercepted a Dak Prescott pass to end the drive. Following a punt by the Raiders, the Cowboys moved right down the field, but were stopped at the Oakland 27 yard line. Settling for a 45-yard field goal, the Cowboys took the lead. The Raiders failed to manage a first down again on their second possession, the Cowboys took over and moved down field again. This time, the Raider defense could not stop the Cowboys and Rod Smith scored on a one-yard run to increase the Cowboy lead to 10-0. The Raider offense did manage two first downs on their next possession, but again were forced to punt. After forcing a Cowboy punt, the Raiders took over with just over three minutes left in the half. The offense came alive as the Raiders moved down to the Cowboy 11 yard line. Derek Carr then hit Jared Cook for an 11 yard touchdown, but Cook was called for pass interference on the play and the touchdown was taken off the board. The Raiders drive stalled and, with three seconds remaining, Giorgio Tavecchio missed a 39-yard field goal as the half expired leaving the score at 10-0. On the opening kickoff of the second half, Cordarrelle Patterson returned the kick 100 yards for a touchdown. However, the return was nullified on a Raider holding call. However, the Raider offense would make up for the mistake as they took the ball 90 yards and Carr found Michael Crabtree on a two-yard pass to narrow the lead to 10-7. On the ensuing Cowboy possession, Sean Smith intercepted Dak Prescott for the second time in the game and returned it 22 yards for a touchdown and Raider lead. Upon review of the play, it was determined that Smith was down by contact at the 22. The Raider offense failed to capitalize on the turnover, only managing one yard and settling for a Tavecchio 39-yard field goal to tie the game at 10. The Raider defense continued its strong play to start the second half by stopping the Cowboys on three plays on the next possession. However, punter Chris Jones took the snap and rushed around the right side of the line for a 24-yard gain and a first down. Nine plays later, Prescott scrambled in from five yards out to retake the lead 17-10. As the fourth quarter began, the Raiders answered as Carr again hit Crabtree from two yards out to cap a 53-yard drive to tie the game at 17. Following punts by both teams, the Cowboys moved to the Raider five-yard line as the two minute warning sounded. However, the Raider defense stiffened and the Cowboys could not get the ball in the end zone. Dan Bailey hit a 19-yard field goal with 1:47 remaining to give the Cowboys a 20-17 lead. Needing a field goal to tie, the Raiders drive stalled at their own 30 yard line with just over one minute remaining. On fourth down, Carr rolled out of the pocket and heaved the ball downfield to Crabtree who could not make the catch. But, the Cowboys were called for pass interference on the play and the Raiders took over on the Dallas 15, well within field goal range. Two plays later, Carr scrambled to the goal line and would have had a first down, but instead attempted to dive to the pylon to score the winning touchdown. Carr, however, lost control of the ball attempting to reach it into the end zone and fumbled it out of the end zone giving the ball to the Cowboys on a touchback. The Cowboys were able to a knee to end the game and secure the 20-17 win. The loss moved the Raiders to 6-8 on the season and eliminated them from the AFC West race. Carr threw for only 171 yards in the game as the offense, as usual, struggled through most of the game. The Raiders committed 14 penalties for 105 yards in the game as their disastrous season all but came to an end. Question: How many field goal kicks were missed during the game?

The music makes us constantly aware of the sea's immensity, it's potential for threat, and the play of light on its waves. But the sea isn't just a special background, it weighs on the lives of the characters, offering them a living, but at a price. In the first act the laboured sound of the strings evokes   the complete heaviness of the sailor's work, as they haul  the boats up the shingle  . Then a storm gathers which rages  through the scene at the Inn, and stirs up an orchestral hurricane. Even when it's calm and favorable, the sea is inescapable. In the comfortable enclosed world of the opera house, this can only be suggested. In the production of Peter Grimes about to open at the Aldeburgh Festival, it will be really present, because the opera is taking place on the beach, the setting for much of the narrative of Britten's opera, and also the poem by the Suffolk poet George Crabbe that inspired it. This won't be the first opera production to be set in the actual landscape in which the action takes place. There's a well-known filmed production of Tosca shot in Castel Gandolfo in Rome, and a production of Donizetti's Anna Bolena was once mounted in the moat  surrounding the Tower of London. But those were manageable urban landscapes, with comfortingly solid buildings to act as wind shields and acoustic blocks. On the Aldeburgh beach there's actually nothing, apart from a few boats, some whole, some wrecked. Here anything more complicated than walking the dog is hard to solve. The wind blows away one's words, so conversation is hard, and anything not tied down tends to blow away. The sliding shingle turns one's steps into a drunken stagger. The idea of performing an opera in these conditions seems quite _ -- an accusation Aldeburgh director Jonathan Reakie takes cheerfully on the chin. Why has he done it? \\"Well, Grimes is the opera of Britten's that's most associated with Aldeburgh, but it's never been produced at the Festival which he founded.... Question: Which of the following can best describe the sailor's work in the first act? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Hard.\\"?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The highest point of a wave is the crest. The lowest point is the trough. The vertical distance between a crest and a trough is the height of the wave. Wave height is also called amplitude. The horizontal distance between two crests is the wavelength. Both amplitude and wavelength are measures of wave size. The size of an ocean wave depends on how fast, over how great a distance, and how long the wind blows. The greater each of these factors is, the bigger a wave will be. Some of the biggest waves occur with hurricanes. A hurricane is a storm that forms over the ocean. Its winds may blow more than 150 miles per hour! The winds also travel over long distances and may last for many days.  Question: \\"How do you calculate the height of a wave?\\" Answer: \\"The vertical distance between the highest point and the lowest point of the wave\\" Is this answer correct? OPT: a. no b. yes...I think the answer is","output":"b. yes, the answer is correct. The height of a wave, also known as the amplitude, can be calculated by determining the vertical distance between the highest point (crest) and the lowest point (trough) of the wave. In order to calculate this, you need to have measurements of the crest and trough positions. Once you obtain these measurements, you can simply subtract the position of the trough from the position of the crest to determine the height or amplitude of the wave. Additionally, it is important to note that several factors influence the size of ocean waves, such as the speed, duration, and distance over which the wind blows. Stronger winds over long distances and for extended periods tend to generate larger waves. Extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, can also lead to the creation of significantly larger waves due to the intense and sustained wind speeds of more than 150 miles per hour. In summary, to calculate the height of a wave, you need to measure the vertical distance between its highest point (the crest) and its lowest point (the trough). The answer provided earlier is correct, as the height of a wave is determined by this vertical distance, which is influenced by various factors such as wind speed, distance, and duration."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? Euclid v. Amble was a case","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"Euclid v. Amble was a case\\" is true, as it refers to the landmark United States Supreme Court case Village of Euclid, Ohio v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U.S. 365 (1926), commonly known as Euclid v. Ambler. This case played a pivotal role in the development and recognition of zoning laws and ordinances in the United States and influenced the implementation of zoning practices in other countries like Canada. The case arose when the Ambler Realty Company sued the Village of Euclid, Ohio, after the village enacted a zoning ordinance that effectively reduced the value of Ambler Realty's property. The ordinance divided the village into six different zoning districts and restricted the use of land and construction within each district. Ambler Realty argued that this ordinance violated the U.S. Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment by depriving it of property without due process of the law and constituting an unreasonable and arbitrary exercise of governmental authority. The Supreme Court's ruling in Euclid v. Ambler came as a surprise to many because the lower courts had ruled in favor of Ambler Realty, striking down the zoning ordinance. However, the Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, upheld the zoning ordinance as a constitutional exercise of the Village of Euclid's police power. The Court recognized that municipal governments need the power to regulate land use for the public welfare and that zoning ordinances like the one in question were necessary to control the growth of urban areas and protect public health, safety, and general welfare. Justice George Sutherland, writing for the majority, acknowledged that while zoning may sometimes diminish property values, this effect was not enough to invalidate zoning ordinances that seek to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of a community. The Court argued that the public interest in maintaining a well-ordered community outweighed any individual property rights that may be negatively impacted by zoning regulations. The Euclid v. Ambler decision established the constitutionality of zoning as a legitimate practice for regulating land use in the United States and laid the groundwork for future zoning cases. Since this landmark ruling, zoning ordinances have been enacted in cities and towns across the country and have had a significant impact on urban planning, development, and the overall shaping of American landscapes. The case's influence also extends beyond the United States, as other countries have adopted zoning practices based on the principles established in this historic decision."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Virarajendra Chola (10631070 CE) was one of the most underrated Chola kings, mainly because a major part of his life was spent as a subordinate of his two elder brothers Rajadhiraja Chola I and Rajendra Chola II, who along with Virarajendra Chola himself were the illustrious sons of their Chakravarti(Emperor) father, Rajendra Chola I. While certainly it was not a practice among the Chola kings to nominate the eldest son, but the most capable (in administration of their domains as well as proving their mettle on the battlefield) as the heir to the throne. During his early reign he granted the maintenance of a school to study the Vedas, Sastras and Grammar and a hostel was provided for the students. A hospital named Virasolan was also provided by him for the sick people. The famous grammatical work in Tamil, Virasoliyam was written by Buddhamitra during his reign.  - Rajendra Chola II reigned as the Chola king succeeding his elder brother Rajadhiraja Chola in the 11th century. He is best remembered for his role in the battle of Koppam along with his elder brother where he dramatically turned the tables on the Chalukyan King Someshvara I, after the death of his brother in 1052. During his early reign an expedition was led to Sri Lanka, in the course of which the Sri Lanka army was routed and their king Vijayabahu I of Polonnaruwa was driven to take refuge in a mountain-fortress. He maintained the Chola Empire well as the distribution of his records show that the Chola Empire did not suffer any loss of territory during his reign.  - Rajendra Chola I or Rajendra I was a Chola emperor who is considered one of the greatest rulers and military generals of India. He succeeded his father Rajaraja Chola I in 1014 CE. During his reign, he extended the influence of the Chola empire to the banks of the river Ganga in North India and across the Indian ocean to the West, making the Chola Empire one of the most powerful empires of India. Rajendras conquests included the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Sri Lanka, Maldives, and he successfully invaded and raided the territories of Srivijaya in Malaysia, Southern Thailand and Indonesia in South East Asia. The Cholas exacted tribute from Thailand and the Khmer kingdom of Cambodia. He defeated Mahipala, the Pala king of Bengal and Bihar, and to commemorate his victory he built a new capital city called Gangaikonda Cholapuram.  - Kpparaksarivarman Rjdhiraja Chla I was an 11th-century emperor of the Indian Chola empire and the successor of his father, Rajendra Chola I. During his long reign, he helped his father conquer many territories and maintained the Chola authority over most of Lanka, Vengi, Kalinga, etc. and the relations with overseas domains despite a series of revolts in the territory. Rajadhiraja Cholas record shows that he was a born fighter who was very capable of maintaining a vast and expansive empire with territories even outside the shores of India. He was a great warrior who always led from the front. His life is a testimony to a king who fought his own wars standing shoulder to shoulder with his men on front lines. He performed the horse sacrifice and earned the title \\"Jayamkonda Cholan\\" (The Victorious Cholan). He was also known as \\"Vijaya Rajendra Cholan\\" (the victorious Rajendra Cholan). One of his predecessors, Rajaraja Chola I also assumed the title Jayangonda Chola towards the \\"end\\" of his reign.  - Athirajendra Chola ( 1070 CE ) reigned for a very short period of few months as the Chola king succeeding his father Virarajendra Chola .

After weighing the pros and cons, with a heavy heart, she chooses to accept the offer and move to Milwaukee, believing it could substantially support her mother's medical expenses. This sudden change leaves Jim emotionally distraught, as he has never faced his audition rejections and the competitive circus that is Broadway without Sara by his side. Nonetheless, Sara insists that he keep chasing his dreams, even from afar. In Milwaukee, Sara settles into her new job while Jim continues to face his struggles alone. One day, he hatches an idea to create a show of his own: a small-scale passion project set to tour community theatres and local arts festivals. He channels his feelings of life without Sara into the production, creating a heartfelt story revolving around the power of friendship and dreams. He enlists the help of fellow aspiring performers, all equals in their hunt for their big break in New York City. As the show slowly gains popularity, Sara learns about Jim's success through social media. Missing her friend terribly and seeing the passion in his work, she decides to come back to the city for a short visit, surprising Jim on opening night of their show's off-Broadway debut. At the end of the show, they reunite with tears and laughter, sharing their stories that have unfolded since their separation. As the night draws to an end, Sara presents Jim with an offer to collaborate: she will handle the graphic design aspects for his shows while Jim continues to create the on-stage magic. Despite the distance between them, they vow to remain each other's biggest cheerleaders and to help one another chase their dreams – together or apart. The movie concludes with a snapshot of the two friends filled with hope and determination, working together, even from a distance, to make the world a more vibrant and colorful place, one dream at a time. Chasing Dreams is a heartwarming tale reflecting the very essence of the human spirit and the value of friendship, dreams, and determination to keep pursuing what you love, no matter where life takes you. Its delightful mix of humorous dialogue and touching emotional scenes brings life to a story that stays with the audience long after the credits roll."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie studios seem determined to ruin as many classic films as they can with thoroughly pointless updates including 'King Kong, 'The Wicker Man' and practically every film that ever starred Michael Caine. This lazy remake mentality is not a new phenomenon, however, as 'Dough for the Do-Do' proves. An entirely pointless colorized version of Bob Clampett's surreal masterpiece 'Porky in Wackyland', 'Dough for the Do-Do' sucks the life out of the original by splashing colour all over Clampett's original footage and adding some lame new footage overseen by Friz Freleng. Freleng was an entirely unsuitable director to be tampering with Clampett's source material, although in truth no director could hope to come close to Clampett's inspired insanity. Inevitably, then, 'Dough for the Do-Do' is nothing more than the raping of a classic with an appalling new title attached.

What does it feel like to be a mother who has Asperger's Syndrome and has a child or children who do not have Asperger's Syndrome? What does it feel like to be a father with Asperger's Syndrome who has a child or children who also have Asperger's Syndrome? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"Being a mother with Asperger's Syndrome who has a child or children without the condition can be a unique experience, filled with both challenges and opportunities for growth. Asperger's Syndrome, a type of autism spectrum disorder, is characterized by difficulties in social interaction, communication, and understanding social cues, as well as a tendency towards repetitive behaviors and focused interests. Mothers with Asperger's Syndrome might face some challenges in parenting, such as: 1. Difficulty in understanding their child's emotional or social needs due to their own difficulty in interpreting social cues. This might lead to feelings of confusion, frustration, and even guilt for not being able to \\"connect\\" with their child in the way they would like to. 2. Struggling with the change and unpredictability that comes with raising children. Those with Asperger's Syndrome often prefer routine and predictability, which can be disrupted by the natural chaos of family life. 3. Social isolation, as forming friendships with other parents or participating in social events might be difficult due to the mother's social challenges. 4. Potential fatigue and overwhelm, as sensory sensitivities and challenges in emotional regulation can make parenting even more demanding for those with Asperger's Syndrome. On the other hand, there can also be positive aspects when a mother with Asperger's Syndrome raises a neurotypical child: 1. Developing a unique understanding of diverse neurology and championing acceptance and understanding of neurodiversity. 2. A heightened level of empathy, as the mother is likely to be more sensitive to her child's feelings and needs, especially if she has faced similar challenges in her own life. 3. An opportunity for growth and increased self-awareness as the mother learns to navigate her own Asperger's Syndrome while parenting. In the case of a father with Asperger's Syndrome who has a child or children who also have the condition, the experience may have similarities and differences when compared to the previous scenario. Some of the challenges that these fathers may face include: 1. Difficulty in understanding or providing adequate emotional support, as fathers with Asperger's Syndrome might struggle with emotional expression and communication. 2. Accepting and accommodating the different behaviors, needs, and routines of each family member, particularly if other family members have differing levels of support needs or co-existing conditions. 3. Struggling to model or teach social skills, as fathers with Asperger's might have difficulty with social interactions themselves. However, there may also be several positive aspects to this situation: 1. A shared understanding and empathy between the father and child based on their similar experiences living with Asperger's Syndrome. 2. The opportunity for the father to provide support, guidance, and strategies for coping with Asperger's, based on his own experiences and insights. 3. The development of strong bonds and unique connections between father and child, based on their shared interests and perspectives. In conclusion, while there may be similarities between the two scenarios, such as experiencing difficulties in social interactions and the challenge of reacting to unpredictable situations, they are not the same. A mother who has Asperger's and raises neurotypical children might struggle to fully understand her child's social and emotional needs, while a father with Asperger's raising a child who also has the condition may benefit from their shared experiences. Both situations have their unique challenges and triumphs, but the differences lie in the dynamics that the presence or absence of Asperger's in the children creates in the parent-child relationships."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The reviewer expresses their dissatisfaction with the poor display of the thermometer, stating that the pre-printed information on the screen makes it difficult to read the necessary information for their chosen programming (i.e., cooking chicken). They mention that the Amazon product picture led them to believe that only their chosen programming would be displayed, and they would not have purchased the thermometer if they had known otherwise. Furthermore, the reviewer emphasizes their disappointment by mentioning that this is the first time they recall being truly disappointed with a product purchased from Amazon. This clearly indicates their dissatisfaction with the product's design and its ability to meet their expectations. The primary concern for the reviewer is the screen's readability, which affects the overall functionality of the thermometer. With the pre-printed information obstructing the readings, the user questions the worth of the product and whether it was a worthy investment. In summary, this product review is negative as it highlights the significant issue of poor screen readability that hinders the thermometer's entire purpose and user experience. The reviewer also expresses their displeasure with the misleading product image on Amazon and their overall disappointment with the quality of the product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The judge said,\\"You may go to prison,or you may go to Camp Green Lake.\\"Stanley was from a poor family. He had never been to camp before. So, Stanley Yelnats seems set to serve an easy sentence,which is only fair because he is as innocent as you or me. But Stanley is not going where he thinks he is. Camp Green Lake is like no other camp anywhere. It is a place that has no lake and nothing green. Nor is it a camp,at least not the kind of camp kids look forward to in the summertime. It is only a desert wasteland,dotted with countless holes dug by the boys who live at the camp. At Camp Green Lake,the warden makes the boys\\" build character\\" by spending all day, every day, digging holes:five feet wide and five feet deep. It doesn't take long for Stanley to realize there's more than character improvement going on at Camp Green Lake. The boys are digging holes because the warden is searching for something,and before long Stanley begins his own search--for the truth. Fate is to find a solution to it all--the family curse,the mystery of the holes. The great wheel of justice has ground slowly for generations,but now it is about to reveal its verdict . Question: In which section of a newspaper does this passage probably appear? Options: A: Law. B: Geography. C: News. D: Literature. A:","output":"D: Literature. Step 1: Read and understand the context of the article. The article is discussing a story about a character named Stanley Yelnats and his experiences at Camp Green Lake, a mysterious place where boys are made to dig holes as a punishment. It also mentions a family curse and a search for the truth. Step 2: Analyze the options provided. A: Law - The article is not focused on legal matters or court cases. Although there is a mention of a judge and a sentence, the main focus is not on the legal system. B: Geography - The article does not focus on geographic information or the study of the earth. Camp Green Lake's setting is mentioned, but it is part of a fictitious story. C: News - While news articles can discuss various topics, the focus of this article is not about current events or news updates. It is about a character and a story. D: Literature - The article is discussing a narrative with a plot, characters, and a mystery. It is most likely discussing a work of fiction (a book or story) which falls under the category of literature. Step 3: Choose the most accurate answer based on the context.

Movie title: Futurama: Bender's Game Context: Ignoring Professor Farnsworth's orders to conserve fuel due to a rise in dark matter prices, Leela borrows the Planet Express ship to enter a demolition derby after being insulted by rednecks. They win it, however the ship is wrecked, but due to botched laser eye surgery, the Professor only notices that the fuel has been used. As punishment, Leela is fitted with a shock collar to teach her anger management. Meanwhile, Bender finds Cubert and Dwight playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons with their friends, but he cannot join in since, as a robot, he has no imagination. After several tries at imagining things, Bender manages to imagine himself as a medieval knight named \\"Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood\\" and enters the game. Unfortunately, he soon gets lost in his fantasy and goes on a rampage, resulting in his commitment to the Hal Institute for Criminally Insane Robots. The crew learns that Mom, who controls the world's only Dark Matter mine, is restricting the supply in order to drive up profits. The Professor reveals to the crew that while working for her many years ago, he stumbled on a way to turn dark matter from a useless curiosity into starship fuel. The process created two energy crystals, with Mom keeping one for herself and Farnsworth hiding the other, \\"anti-backwards\\" crystal. If the two crystals are brought together, they will render all dark matter useless. Farnsworth has forgotten where he hid his crystal, but it is being used as a 12-sided die in the kids' D&amp;D game. Mom determines its location and sends her sons Walt, Larry and Igner to retrieve it, by saying that they are owl exterminators, but Farnsworth foils their attempt by sending an angry owl at them, messing up their plan since they do not know how to exterminate owls. Farnsworth, Fry, and Leela fly to Mom's mine with the crystal in order to neutralize the dark matter. Reaching Mom's mine, the trio discovers the heart of the operation: thousands of captive Nibblonians, including Nibbler, being force fed chickens in order to... The answer to this question is:","output":"In the movie Futurama: Bender's Game, the crucial element to destroying the dice is not explicitly stated. However, the two energy crystals, which are generated from the process of turning dark matter into starship fuel, are the key items in this context. In the movie, one crystal is kept by Mom, and the other, \\"anti-backwards\\" crystal is hidden by Professor Farnsworth, which is then being used as a 12-sided die in the kids' Dungeons & Dragons game. To destroy the dice or render dark matter useless, both energy crystals need to be brought together. When these two crystals are combined, they will neutralize all dark matter, thus making the dice insignificant in this context. The main objective of the characters in Futurama: Bender's Game is not necessarily to destroy the dice, but rather to neutralize the dark matter that powers the starships. The dice itself plays a critical role as it contains the \\"anti-backwards\\" crystal needed for the process. By bringing the energy crystals together at Mom's mine, Farnsworth, Fry, and Leela aim to neutralize the dark matter and ultimately eliminate Mom's control of the dark matter supply monopoly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Anti-Chinese protests in Vietnam descended into deadly violence last week. The unrest was provoked by Chinese oil drilling in disputed waters. Vietnamese authorities have arrested hundreds and are calling for protests to stop. Article:","output":"Title: China Evacuates 3,000 Citizens from Vietnam Amid Anti-Chinese Protests and Disputed Oil Drilling China has recently evacuated over 3,000 of its citizens from Vietnam, according to Xinhua news agency, following a surge of anti-Chinese protests that erupted into deadly violence last week. This string of events began as a result of China's controversial oil drilling activities in disputed waters, which has sparked tensions between the two neighboring countries. The dispute over the South China Sea, where China has been deploying oil rigs, has long been a source of tension between Beijing and Hanoi. This conflict has escalated more recently with Chinese companies embarking on oil exploration projects in contentious areas, often within what Vietnam considers its exclusive economic zone. In response, groups of Vietnamese citizens took to the streets to protest China's oil drilling activities. However, the protests soon devolved into rampant violence, resulting in the destruction of property and loss of life. Numerous Chinese-owned factories were targeted throughout Vietnam, causing significant damage and forcing thousands of Chinese nationals to flee the country for their safety. In an effort to reduce violence and restore order, Vietnamese authorities have arrested hundreds of individuals and are publicly urging demonstrators to cease their protests. Still, the underlying tensions between China and Vietnam concerning the disputed territory and natural resources remain unresolved, with the potential to cause future unrest. The recent anti-Chinese protests in Vietnam highlight an ongoing struggle for power in the South China Sea. Various nations in the region, including Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Brunei, have overlapping territorial claims with China, and tensions have been growing steadily in recent years. Coordinated actions by multiple Southeast Asian governments can be seen as a response to China's increasingly assertive territorial claims in the area. China's government and state-run media have criticized the actions of the Vietnamese protesters, describing them as \\"unjustified\\" and stating that Chinese companies are operating legitimately within the disputed waters. Furthermore, Chinese officials have reiterated their determination to protect their nation's interests in the South China Sea, emphasizing that they will not be deterred by protests or hostile actions from neighboring countries. Although Vietnam's government has taken steps to arrest protesters and call for an end to the violence, there remains a persistent undercurrent of discontent and resentment among Vietnamese citizens toward China's perceived infringement on their rights. As these tensions remain unresolved, there is a real danger that further demonstrations may erupt in the future, potentially putting more lives and property at risk. While both governments are seeking to address the immediate violence and restore calm, finding a long-term solution to the complex territorial disputes that underpin this current crisis will require concerted diplomatic efforts, mutual understanding, and compromise between both parties. The international community will undoubtedly be watching with interest as these tensions continue to unfold, as stability in the South China Sea is crucial not just for the directly involved parties, but also for regional and global security. In conclusion, the evacuation of more than 3,000 Chinese citizens from Vietnam comes at a critical juncture for both countries, as they grapple with rising tensions and the consequences of deadly violence caused by deep-rooted territorial disputes. While the immediate focus for both governments will be on restoring order and ensuring the safety of their citizens, a longer-term solution to these protracted conflicts will be essential to guarantee regional stability and preserve global security."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. We think if Bill left. How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","output":"The sentence \\"We think if Bill left\\" does pose some challenges in terms of linguistic integrity. Linguistic integrity broadly refers to the extent to which a sentence adheres to the rules of syntax, semantics and pragmatics in a particular language. We'll consider each of these areas in the above sentence. 1. Syntax: Syntax refers to the way words are arranged and combined to form phrases and sentences. From a purely syntactic point of view, \\"We think if Bill left\\" is problematic. The verb \\"think\\" requires an object or a complement to complete its meaning, and the complement usually takes the form of a noun phrase, a verb phrase, or a clause. However, in this sentence, \\"if Bill left\\" is a conditional clause which typically should be accompanied by a main clause to form a complete conditional sentence. There is no main clause associated with the conditional clause \\"if Bill left\\", which creates syntactic ambiguity. 2. Semantics: Semantics deals with the meanings of words, phrases, and sentences. Semantically, the sentence is also ambiguous. It's not clear what the speaker believes or thinks about Bill leaving. The \\"if\\" implies a condition or a hypothesis, but without a main clause it is not clear what the outcome or consequence is. 3. Pragmatics: Pragmatics is about how context influences the interpretation of meaning. Without further context, it's hard to determine what the intended meaning of the sentence is. Is it a concern? A prediction? Are there missing words that would provide more explanation? Here are a few ways to clear up the ambiguity and maintain the linguistic integrity of the sentence: \\"We think (it will be a great loss) if Bill left.\\" \\"We think (that things will change) if Bill left.\\" \\"We think (he should reconsider) if Bill left.\\" In each of these revisions, the verb \\"think\\" is followed by a clause that makes clear what the speakers believe or think about the hypothetical situation of Bill leaving. In conclusion, the sentence \\"We think if Bill left\\" challenges linguistic integrity at the syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic levels. Offering a main clause that serves as the outcome or consequence of Bill leaving can resolve this issue, but without that additional information, the sentence remains ambiguous and lacks clarity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I so wanted to go to the Hyderabad Music Day, but thanks to uninvited guests","output":"The sentiment of this tweet can be described as a combination of disappointment, frustration, and resignation. Firstly, there is an evident sense of disappointment, as the person tweeting genuinely wanted to attend the Hyderabad Music Day event. The use of the phrase \\"I so wanted\\" indicates a strong desire and genuine interest in the event, suggesting that it was an opportunity they were looking forward to attending and potentially enjoying themselves at. Secondly, the mention of \\"uninvited guests\\" alludes to an unexpected disruption in their plans. These guests could potentially be people that the tweet author did not plan on having over or interacting with, thus hindering their ability to attend the event. This introduction of an unforeseen factor contributes to a sense of frustration, as it implies the person tweeting had no control over the situation and was ultimately forced to miss the event due to external circumstances. Lastly, the tone of resignation could be inferred from the tweet as well. The use of the phrase \\"thanks to,\\" followed by \\"uninvited guests,\\" carries a sarcastic undertone. It highlights that the tweeting individual accepts their current circumstance, even if it is unfavorable or inconvenient. They seem to acknowledge the reality and recognize that the inability to go to Hyderabad Music Day was ultimately out of their control. This demonstration of acceptance, albeit begrudgingly, further contributes to the overall sentiment of resignation in the tweet. In conclusion, the sentiment expressed in the tweet can be characterized as a blend of disappointment, frustration, and resignation. The tweet author displayed a keen interest in attending the Hyderabad Music Day event, which was thwarted by unexpected guests, thereby inciting a sense of frustration. This ultimately leads to the individual grudgingly accepting their reality, demonstrating a feeling of resignation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

ROLAND NARROWED HIS EYES AND STARED UPWARD INTO THE DARKNESS, across the top of Mont Segur toward the Cathar fortress. Standing on a high walkway of planks behind the palisade of the crusaders' small wooden fort, he heard faraway voices and saw torches moving on the Cathar rampart. The two men on watch with him that night, a sergeant from Champagne and a young man-at-arms from Brittany, were talking in low tones about the women to be had far below, at the foot of the mountain. They seemed not to see the activity about the Cathar stronghold on the upper peak of the mountaintop opposite their own fort. But Roland, knowing Diane was in the besieged fortress, could not take his eyes from it. He knew he had to act soon. Each day the crusaders grew stronger and the Cathars weaker. Once the Cathar stronghold fell, the crusaders would slaughter all within, including Diane. The sergeant, chuckling, was offering his young companion a wineskin. The Breton never received it. From behind the Cathar wall came the sound of a huge thump, as if a giant's fist had pounded Mont Segur. Roland recognized the sound, and fought panic as he thrust his arms out, trying to push the other two men toward the ladder. But there was no time for them to climb down to safety. The thump was the counter-weight of a stone-caster, and the whistling noise that followed fast upon it was the rock it had thrown. A shape as big as a wine barrel blotted out the stars. The stone hit the parapet beside Roland, and the whole palisade shuddered.

Plants also detect the daily cycle of light and darkness. Do you know how plants respond to these changes? Some plants open their leaves during the day. It is during these hours the plant can collect sunlight. At night, the plant closes its leaves to prevent water loss. Many plants respond to the change in the length of the day. As days grow shorter, some plants respond by going dormant. Dormant is when a plant suspends its growth. It does this in order to survive. Shorter days signal the coming of winter. Winter in most areas means extreme cold. It is also very dry in the winter months. As winter approaches, some plants respond by their leaves changing color. After the change in color, they fall off. This dormancy period helps trees. It allows them to survive the cold and dry winter. Plants only want to grow when conditions are right.  Question: \\"What happens with growth rate in some plants when days grow shorter?\\" Answer: \\"It will go dormant\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"Yes, the answer is correct.

But when bad weather gives you trouble, can you still make it before the bell rings? In northern China during spring, big sandstorms often make trouble for students and everyone else. When the sky is dark with sand, buses and cars all move much more slowly. Sometimes, people can't even see for 20 metres. Sandstorms usually happen in spring. This year, sandstorms started in late March. They have happened in more than 10 provinces    in northern China this year. More than 70 million people have had problems in those places because of the sandstorms. People in southern China don't have to worry about this kind of bad weather. Most of the sand comes from Gansu and Inner Mongolia . In northern China, lots of places have few trees and don't get much rain. People there have been cutting down too many trees. When there aren't many trees, the ground can't keep enough water. Over the years, the ground dries up and turns to sand. When spring comes and the ice melts , the ground becomes looser . Strong winds take the loose sand into the sky. Sandstorms are bad for people's health. If people breathe  too much sand, they could cough or have asthma . Sandstorms also give farmers lots of problems. Sometimes their sheep get lost in the storms and never get back home. The winds also tear down farmers' houses. What can you do to stop sandstorms? Here's an idea: Ask you parents to help you plant some trees this spring. If you see people cutting down too many trees, tell them about the dangers of sandstorms, and ask your government to stop them from cutting. Question: According to the passage, what cannot be caused by sandstorms? Answer: A:","output":"According to the passage, there is no mention that sandstorms cannot cause a particular event or issue.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose work was dismissed by some critics? ?  Nixon in China is an opera in three acts by John Adams, with a libretto by Alice Goodman. Adams' first opera, it was inspired by U.S. President Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China. The work premiered at the Houston Grand Opera on October 22, 1987, in a production by Peter Sellars with choreography by Mark Morris. When Sellars approached Adams with the idea for the opera in 1983, Adams was initially reluctant, but eventually decided that the work could be a study in how myths come to be, and accepted the project. Goodman's libretto was the result of considerable research into Nixon's visit, though she disregarded most sources published after the 1972 trip. To create the sounds he sought, Adams augmented the orchestra with a large saxophone section, additional percussion, and electronic synthesizer. Although sometimes described as minimalist, the score displays a variety of musical styles, embracing minimalism after the manner of Philip Glass alongside passages echoing 19th-century composers such as Wagner and Johann Strauss. With these ingredients, Adams mixes Stravinskian 20th-century neoclassicism, jazz references, and big band sounds reminiscent of Nixon's youth in the 1930s. The combination of these elements varies frequently, to reflect changes in the onstage action. Following the 1987 premiere, the opera received mixed reviews; some critics dismissed the work, predicting it would soon vanish. However, it has been presented on many occasions since, in both Europe and North America, and has been recorded twice. In 2011, the opera received its Metropolitan Opera debut, a production based on the original sets, and in the same year was given an abstract production in Toronto by the Canadian Opera Company. Recent critical opinion has tended to recognize the work as a significant and lasting contribution to American opera.

Question 1: What is relation between linear velocity and angular velocity? Question 2: What is the relation between linear and angular displacement? Choices: 1. no. 2. yes. Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"In order to answer this question, let's analyze each question first: Question 1: What is the relation between linear velocity and angular velocity? Linear velocity refers to the velocity of an object moving in a straight line, while angular velocity refers to how quickly an object rotates. The relation between linear velocity (v) and angular velocity (ω) for a rotating object can be represented by the formula: v = r * ω where r is the radius of the circle formed by the path of the object in motion and ω is the angular velocity in radians per second. Question 2: What is the relation between linear and angular displacement? Linear displacement refers to the distance an object travels in a straight line, while angular displacement refers to the angle through which an object rotates. The relation between linear displacement (s) and angular displacement (θ) can be formulated as: s = r * θ where r is the radius of the circle formed by the path of the object in motion and θ is the angular displacement in radians. Now, let's compare the two questions: Question 1 is asking for the relation between linear velocity and angular velocity, while Question 2 is asking for the relation between linear displacement and angular displacement.

Title: Yellow Submarine Movie plot: Pepperland is a cheerful, music-loving paradise under the sea, protected by Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The titular Yellow Submarine rests on an Aztec-like pyramid on a hill. At the edge of the land is a range of high blue mountains. The land falls under a surprise attack from the music-hating Blue Meanies, who live in or beyond the blue mountains. The attack starts with magical projectiles fired from big artillery stationed in the blue mountains. The Blue Meanies seal the band inside a music-proof blue glass globe, they render the Pepperlanders immobile as statues by shooting arrows and dropping giant green apples upon them (a reference to the Apple Records music label), and drain the countryside of colour.

The population increase since the census has been modest, the province at 2014 end had 107,240,000 people.  - A diva is a celebrated female singer; a woman of outstanding talent in the world of opera, and by extension in theatre, cinema and popular music. The meaning of \\"diva\\" is closely related to that of \\"prima donna\\".  - John Woo SBS (Ng Yu-Sum; born 1 May 1946) is a Chinese-born Hong Kong film director, writer, and producer. He is considered a major influence on the action genre, known for his highly chaotic action sequences, Mexican standoffs, and frequent use of slow motion. Woo has directed several notable Hong Kong action films, among them, \\"A Better Tomorrow\\" (1986), \\"The Killer\\" (1989), \\"Hard Boiled\\" (1992), and \\"Red Cliff\\" (2008/2009).   - Mainland China, also known as the Chinese mainland or simply the mainland, is the geopolitical area under the direct jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China (PRC). It generally excludes the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau; however, it usually includes Hainan. The term \\"mainland China\\", which avoids calling the area simply \\"China\\" and thereby recognizing the founding of the PRC as \\"the\\" \\"China\\", was coined by the Kuomintang (KMT) after receiving control of Taiwan from Japan after World War II. By 1949, the KMT-led Republic of China (ROC) government was defeated in the Chinese Civil War in mainland China and fled to the island of Taiwan where the KMT pledged to \\"retake the Mainland\\". The KMT considers both sides of the Taiwan Strait (including Taiwan), as (one) \\"China\\" and one country, whereas Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) considers only mainland China as \\"China\\" and Taiwan (ROC) as \\"Taiwan\\" and maintains that they are different countries.  - The Pearl River Delta (PRD), also known as Zhujiang Delta or Zhusanjiao, is the low-lying area surrounding the Pearl River estuary, where the Pearl River flows into the South China Sea. It is one of the most densely urbanised regions in the world and is an economic hub of China. This region is often considered an emerging megacity. The PRD is a megalopolis, with future development into a single mega metropolitan area, yet itself is at the southern end of a larger megalopolis running along the southern coast of China, which include metropolises such as Chaoshan, Zhangzhou-Xiamen, Quanzhou-Putian, and Fuzhou. The nine largest cities of PRD had a combined population of 57.15 million at the end of 2013, comprising 53.69% of the provincial population.

His films \\"Come Drink with Me\\" (1966), \\"Dragon Gate Inn\\" (1967), and \\"A Touch of Zen\\" (19691971) inaugurated a new generation of \\"wuxia\\" films in the late 1960s. Apart from being a film director, Hu was also a screenwriter and set designer.  - Andy Lau Tak-wah, BBS, MH, JP (born 27 September 1961) is a Hong Kong actor, singer and film producer. He has been one of Hong Kong's most commercially successful film actors since the mid-1980s, performing in more than 160 films while maintaining a successful singing career at the same time.

During her prime years, She made major contributions to the Cantopop music scene while receiving numerous awards and honours. She remained an idol throughout most of her career, and was generally regarded as a Cantopop diva. Mui once held a sold-out concert in Hammersmith, London, England, where she was dubbed the \\"Madonna of Asia\\" (), which brought her to further international fame. That title stayed with her throughout her career, and has been used as a comparison for both Eastern and Western media.  - Cantopop (a contraction of \\"Cantonese pop music\\") or HK-pop (short for \\"Hong Kong pop music\\") is a genre of Cantonese music made primarily in Hong Kong, and also used to refer to the cultural context of its production and consumption. Originating in the 1970s, Cantopop reached its height of popularity in the 1980s and 1990s before its slow decline in the 2000s. The term \\"Cantopop\\" itself was coined in 1978 after \\"Cantorock\\", a term first used in 1974. During its height, Cantopop had spread to China, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.  - Chan Kong-sang, SBS, MBE, PMW, (born 7 April 1954), known professionally as Jackie Chan, is a Hong Kong martial artist, actor, film director, producer, stuntman and singer.

He has been a fight choreographer for, amongst others, Jackie Chan, King Hu and John Woo.  - Hong Kong action cinema is the principal source of the Hong Kong film industry's global fame. It combines elements from the action film, as codified by Hollywood, with Chinese storytelling, aesthetic traditions and filmmaking techniques, to create a culturally distinctive form that nevertheless has a wide transcultural appeal. In recent years, the flow has reversed somewhat, with American and European action films being heavily influenced by Hong Kong genre conventions.  - Macau (literally: \\"Bay Gate\\"), (in Portuguese, which is still widely used in the city) also spelled Macao (in English), officially the Região Administrativa Especial de Macau da República Popular da China, is an autonomous territory on the western side of the Pearl River Delta in East Asia. Macau is bordered by the city of Zhuhai in China to the North and the Pearl River Estuary to the East and South. Hong Kong lies about to its East across the Delta. With a population of 650,900 living in an area of , it is the most densely populated region in the world.  - A ballad is a form of verse, often a narrative set to music.

Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of the British Isles from the later medieval period until the 19th century. They were widely used across Europe, and later in the Americas, Australia and North Africa. Ballads are 13 lines with an ABABBCBC form, consisting of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables.  - Film producers fill a variety of roles depending upon the type of producer. Either employed by a production company or independent, producers plan and coordinate various aspects of film production, such as selecting script, coordinating writing, directing and editing, and arranging financing. During the \\"discovery stage\\", the producer has to find and acknowledge promising material. Then, unless the film is supposed to be based on an original script, the producer has to find an appropriate screenwriter.  - Alan Tam Wing-lun MH (23 August 1950) is a Hong Kong singer and actor.

She takes them out and leaves them on the kitchen counter while she pours herself a glass of wine. Her roommate, Carla, comes out and decides to take a more scientific approach toward the chicken sandwiches. Carla sees that the average kinetic energy in sandwich A is higher than the average kinetic energy in sandwich B. Carla then takes a big bite out of both sandwiches and returns to her room as if nothing happened.  Answer the following question: Which sandwich was in the microwave for a longer period of time? A:","output":"Based on the provided background information and the situation, it can be inferred that sandwich A was in the microwave for a longer period of time compared to sandwich B.  The rationale behind this inference is the relationship between the temperature and the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. As the temperature increases due to the microwave heating, the particles of matter in the sandwich move more quickly, thus having a higher average kinetic energy.  In the given situation, Carla observed that the average kinetic energy in sandwich A is higher than that in sandwich B. This indicates that the particles in sandwich A were moving faster, resulting from it being warmer. Since the microwave's primary function is to heat up food, it is reasonable to deduce that sandwich A was subjected to a longer period of microwaving compared to sandwich B.  Consequently, as sandwich A had a higher average kinetic energy and felt warmer, it can be concluded that it was microwaved for a longer duration than sandwich B."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (April 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) God and Lucifer are engaged in a war for the souls of humanity; a standing wager for the souls of all mankind. Angels and demons are forbidden to manifest on Earth, but they are allowed to possess and influence humans, and half-breeds are used to peddle influence. Exorcist John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) was born with the power to see angels and demons. At age 15, he committed suicide to escape his visions, but he was revived after spending two minutes in Hell, though John explains that since time moves differently in Hell 2 minutes feels like a full lifetime. Consequently, his soul is bound for Hell when he dies for the sin of taking his own life. John exorcises a girl possessed by a soldier demon trying to break through to Earth, something that should not be possible, as demons cannot take their true physical form on the mortal plane. John seeks an audience with the androgynous half-breed angel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton). He asks Gabriel for a reprieve from his impending death from lung cancer; but Gabriel declines, telling John that his motives for exorcising demons are selfish and will not earn him entry into Heaven. After he leaves Gabriel, John repels an attack by a full demon out in the open. This encounter prompts him to meet with former witch doctor Papa Midnite (Djimon Hounsou) who informs him that all of Hell is waiting for him to die and that he is the one soul Lucifer would come to collect himself. There, John also encounters half-breed demon Balthazar (Gavin Rossdale). Midnite refuses to become involved, wanting to retain the balance between Heaven and Hell. John begins investigating the situation with his associates Beeman (Max Baker), Hennessy (Pruitt Taylor Vince), and Chas Kramer (Shia LaBeouf).

Paragraph: The after-action review had treated the CIA as the lead agency for any offensive against al Qaeda, and the principals, at their March 10 meeting, had endorsed strengthening the CIA's capability for that role. To the CTC, that meant proceeding with \\"The Plan,\\" which it had put forward half a year earlier-hiring and training more case officers and building up the capabilities of foreign security services that provided intelligence via liaison. On occasion, as in Jordan in December 1999, these liaison services took direct action against al Qaeda cells. In the CTC and higher up, the CIA's managers believed that they desperately needed funds just to continue their current counterterrorism effort, for they reckoned that the millennium alert had already used up all of the Center's funds for the current fiscal year; the  Bin Laden unit had spent 140 percent of its allocation. Tenet told us he met with Berger to discuss funding for counterterrorism just two days after the principals' meeting. While Clarke strongly favored giving the CIA more money for counterterrorism, he differed sharply with the CIA's managers about where it should come from. They insisted that the CIA had been shortchanged ever since the end of the Cold War. Their ability to perform any mission, counterterrorism included, they argued, depended on preserving what they had, restoring what they had lost since the beginning of the 1990s, and building from there-with across-the-board recruitment and training of new case officers, and the reopening of closed stations. To finance the counterterrorism effort, Tenet had gone to congressional leaders after the 1998 embassy bombings and persuaded them to give the CIA a special supplemental appropriation. Now, in the aftermath of the millennium alert, Tenet wanted a boost in overall funds for the CIA and another supplemental appropriation specifically for counterterrorism. To Clarke, this seemed evidence that the CIA's leadership did not give sufficient priority to the battle against  Bin Laden and al Qaeda. He told us that James Pavitt, the head of the CIA's Directorate of Operations, \\"said if there's going to be money spent on going after  Bin Laden, it should be given to him. My view was that he had had a lot of money to do it and a long time to do it, and I didn't want to put more good money after bad.\\" The CIA had a very different attitude: Pavitt told us that while the CIA's  Bin Laden unit did\\"extraordinary and commendable work,\\" his chief of station in London \\"was just as much part of the al Qaeda struggle as an officer sitting in [the  Bin Laden unit].\\" The dispute had large managerial implications, for Clarke had found Ailies in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

Coffee, cigarettes, alcohol, refined sugar, junk foods, fast foods, overcooked foods, refined breads, meat, etc. make our body acidic. Try to avoid them. Raw foods, particularly vegetables, are good to maintain alkalinity of blood and body tissue. Consuming too much milk also makes the blood pH acidic although it is a good source of calcium. Calcium is the building block of the bones. It is also important for optimum health of cartilage. Calcium strengthens vertebral discs as well as fibrocartilages. It is particularly important for the elderly and post-menopausal females, who are more prone to develop calcium deficit and fractures.  Nut-milks, nut-butters (not peanut butter), nuts, seeds, green vegetables like broccoli, green leaves and sprouts are examples of calcium rich foods. You may also take calcium supplements if you are doubtful about dietary sources or if you have a recognized calcium deficit. Take Tab Calcium 500 mg or Tab Calcium+ Vitamin D preparation once daily until your symptoms disappear completely. . Regular exercising is very good for bones and joints functioning. Any form of exercising like yoga aerobics or simple walking, can be employed. Here's how it helps:  By strengthening back muscles, weight bearing potential is improved. Increases spinal flexibility. By strengthening belly muscles and muscles of legs and arms, weight is evenly distributed and this reduces back strain. Age related bone loss is significantly minimized, thus making the spines strong and able to withstand the stress. . You might have noticed that obese people complain more of backache, disc prolapse and all other sorts of spine problems. When you are upright, your weight is supported by the spine, so the spine has to bear the additional stress when a person is obese. This causes minor injuries and degeneration. Try to keep your weight at an ideal limit for your height. Your doctor will be able to pinpoint a good weight for you and start you on a plan to lose weight and exercise safely. Even a few pounds can make a difference! Summary:","output":"Spinal discs are parts of our body that need water and good nutrients to stay healthy. Drinking enough water and eating the right foods can help keep them strong. Exercise and having a healthy weight can also make our back and spine feel better. It's important to take care of our body so we don't have back problems."},{"instruction":"I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: who shot franz ferdinand Suggested answer: A plaque commemorating the location of the Sarajevo assassination and steps of Gavrilo Princip (image taken in 1987, before steps were removed in 1992 and plaque changed from Cyrillic to Latin script) Should I validate this answer?","output":"No, this answer should not be validated.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: You will want to use a pressed powder to use as eyeliner, which is powder that is tightly compressed and does not move around inside its container.  An example of pressed powder is virtually any eyeshadow on the market; they are generally sold as pressed powders to prevent mess and spills. Most of the time, if you want to use pressed powder to apply as eyeliner, you will be using an eyeshadow. Using pressed powder as eyeliner is generally the easiest method because it requires the least amount of precision and has a smudged, not-too-defined effect. The type of brush that you use will affect how the makeup looks on the client’s eyes.  A small brush with tight bristles will create a very defined, precise effect. The smaller and tighter the brush and bristles, the more defined the look. A larger brush with loose bristles will create a loose, smudged effect that is not very precise. You will want to make sure that your brush is clean and doesn’t have remnants of old makeup on it. Spray isopropyl alcohol on the brush. It should dry in a few minutes or less.  You can clean your brushes by using a makeup cleaning spray from Sephora, which dries relatively quickly, depending on the size of the brush. Smaller brushes will dry faster than large brushes.  Isopropyl alcohol spray is available at drug stores, beauty supply stores, and can be ordered off websites such as Amazon.com. You can disinfect your powder by scraping off the top layer of powder with a dry tissue or by spraying isopropyl alcohol onto it. You may have to wait fifteen minutes or so for the powder to dry if you use alcohol spray on it, so do this only if you have enough time. Ask the client to close their eyes. Place your thumb on the client’s cheekbone and your pointer finger above the eyebrow. Gently stretch the skin so that it is not wrinkled or creased on the eyelid. Gently tap the powder onto the desired area of the eye.  Powder does not last for very long on the brush, so you will have to re-dip your brush into the powder several times to get an even application. Dampening the brush with water will yield a more precise application. Repeat the application of the powder onto the eyelid until you achieve the desired result. A heavier application will result in a darker, more dramatic look.","output":"This article is about using pressed powder, like eyeshadow, as eyeliner and how to apply it for different effects with various brushes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What counties was the CEW in?, using the article: The Clinton Engineer Works (CEW) was the production installation of the Manhattan Project that during World War II produced the enriched uranium used in the 1945 bombing of Hiroshima, as well as the first examples of reactor-produced plutonium. It consisted of production facilities arranged at three major sites, various utilities including a power plant, and the town of Oak Ridge. It was in East Tennessee, about 18 miles (29 km) west of Knoxville, and was named after the town of Clinton, eight miles (13 km) to the north. The production facilities were mainly in Roane County, and the northern part of the site was in Anderson County. The Manhattan District Engineer, Kenneth Nichols, moved the Manhattan District headquarters from Manhattan to Oak Ridge in August 1943. During the war, Clinton's advanced research was managed for the government by the University of Chicago. Construction workers were housed in a community known as Happy Valley. Built by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1943, this temporary community housed 15,000 people. The township of Oak Ridge was established to house the production staff. The operating force peaked at 50,000 workers just after the end of the war. The construction labor force peaked at 75,000 and the combined employment peak was 80,000. The town was developed by the federal government as a segregated community; black residents lived only in an area known as Gamble Valley, in government-built \\"hutments\\" (one-room shacks) on the south side of what is now Tuskegee Drive., what would be the answer ?

Charles-Camille Saint-Saëns (French: [ʃaʁlkamij sɛ̃sɑ̃s]; 9 October 1835 – 16 December 1921) was a French composer, organist, conductor and pianist of the Romantic era. His best-known works include Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso (1863), the Second Piano Concerto (1868), the First Cello Concerto (1872), Danse macabre (1874), the opera Samson and Delilah (1877), the Third Violin Concerto (1880), the Third (\\"Organ\\") Symphony (1886) and The Carnival of the Animals (1886). Saint-Saëns was a musical prodigy; he made his concert debut at the age of ten. After studying at the Paris Conservatoire he followed a conventional career as a church organist, first at Saint-Merri, Paris and, from 1858, La Madeleine, the official church of the French Empire. After leaving the post twenty years later, he was a successful freelance pianist and composer, in demand in Europe and the Americas. As a young man, Saint-Saëns was enthusiastic for the most modern music of the day, particularly that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner, although his own compositions were generally within a conventional classical tradition. He was a scholar of musical history, and remained committed to the structures worked out by earlier French composers. This brought him into conflict in his later years with composers of the impressionist and dodecaphonic schools of music; although there were neoclassical elements in his music, foreshadowing works by Stravinsky and Les Six, he was often regarded as a reactionary in the decades around the time of his death. Saint-Saëns held only one teaching post, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse in Paris, and remained there for less than five years. It was nevertheless important in the development of French music: his students included Gabriel Fauré, among whose own later pupils was Maurice Ravel. Both of them were strongly influenced by Saint-Saëns, whom they revered as a genius.

Opeth recorded its debut album, Orchid, with producer Dan Swanö in April 1994. Because of distribution problems with the newly formed Candlelight Records, the album was not released until May 15, 1995, and only in Europe. Orchid tested the boundaries of traditional death metal, featuring acoustic guitars, piano, and clean vocals.After a few live shows in the United Kingdom, Opeth returned to the studio in March 1996 to begin work on a second album, again produced by Dan Swanö. The album was named Morningrise, and was released in Europe on June 24, 1996. With only five songs, but lasting 66 minutes, it features Opeth's longest song, the twenty-minute \\"Black Rose Immortal\\".

Now, I look at my two girls, ages 9 and 3, and worry for their safety - probably more than I should, but understandable given what I went through. We have had lots of “body safety” talks and my older daughter understands the very basics of what I went through, mainly because I have spent a great part of this past year writing a memoir about my experiences and have begun speaking publicly about what I went through and what it means to be a survivor. This is challenging because it’s hard to talk about and explain to a child in a way that they understand without making them fear the world. I struggle with this often. I’ve chosen to use it as an opportunity to teach them about activism and the power of speaking the truth, what it means to be a survivor instead of a victim. I hope they grow up and see just how strong their mother is and how she has worked in the community to raise awareness and help others. Question: How does the mom feel about the world?

Emily suspects that the parents have been mistreating Lilith, and proposes to her department to take the child away from her parents' custody. Emily's fears are confirmed when Lilith's parents try to kill her by roasting her in the oven at their home. Emily saves Lilith with the help of Detective Mike Barron (Ian McShane). Lilith is originally sent to a children's home, but she begs Emily to look after her instead. With the agreement of the board, Emily is assigned to take care of Lilith until a suitable foster family comes along. In the meantime, Lilith's parents, Edward and Margaret (Callum Keith Rennie and Kerry O'Malley), are placed in a mental institution.Not too long after Lilith moves in, strange things begin to happen around Emily. Two weeks later, another of Emily's cases, a boy named Diego (Alexander Conti), suddenly murders his parents, and Barron informs Emily that somebody phoned Diego from her house the night before the crime. As she is suspected of involvement in the incident, Lilith undergoes a psychiatric evaluation by Emily's best friend, Douglas J. Ames (Bradley Cooper). During the session, however, Lilith turns the evaluation around, asking Douglas what his fears are and subtly threatening him. That night while studying he receives a strange phone call in his apartment, Douglas is panicked by the sight of a mass of hornets coming out of his body and kills himself in his bathroom by snapping his own neck.Emily gradually becomes fearful of having Lilith in her home, so she heads to the mental asylum for answers from Lilith's parents. They tell her that Lilith is a demon who feeds on feelings, and that they tried to kill her in an attempt to save themselves. Lilith's father tells Emily that the only way to kill Lilith is to get her to sleep. Shortly after Emily leaves the asylum,...

It's dangerous. It really is dangerous. And you have to teach yourself to look the other way. Interviewer: Someone said that Britain and the United States are divided by a common language. Have you had any difficulties with the language here? Mathew: Oh, yeah-tremendous amount of difficulty but I'm starting to pick it up now-all the lingo and slang and all those-but there's definitely a difference. Interviewer: Can you give me any example? Mathew: Well, the big-I'd say some of the biggest ones would be the word \\"queue\\" which means in America \\"line\\". I never heard the word \\"queue\\" before. Um-what you call \\"chips\\", I call \\"French fries\\". I never heard them called \\"chips\\". Urn-there's so many-urn-words that are different. Ah-\\" crisps\\" which mean \\" potato chips\\" Yeah, that's - we call them \\"potato chips\\" or \\"chips\\" in America. You call them \\"crisps\\" here. So when I heard the word \\"chips\\", I was thinking of \\"crisps\\" and not French fry-you know-it's very confusing but-urn-but just some of the expressions like-er-\\" mate\\" you know and \\"love\\". Those-you know--they're funny. You don't hear them. You don't hear them in America. Interviewer: What about with young people-with people your own age-I mean, do you notice differences there? Mathew: I do notice some differences-er-I think-ah-I think the younger people in Britain are-they seem to be-much more radical than the younger people in the United States. I noticed that. Ah-the dress is different. You see a lot of-I see a lot of males here with earring in one of their-in one of their ears. You don't see that in America that much. Somet-maybe here and there, but not, not like you see it here. Ah-so many of the young people wear black-clothing-you know, I don't-you don't see the other colors. At home you see all different types of bright colors-and in England you see so much black. Especially on the women. Interviewer: You don't like that? Mathew: Not really. It's just my own preference. I like-I'd rather see different colors here and there-not all-not all one color. Everyone looks like Madonna. Interviewer: When you say \\"radical\\"-do you-are you just thinking of clothes or of anything else? Mathew: Um-no, I think-er-radical as in going against the norms-could you say? Not only in clothing but I think in politics too whereas in America-er-you don't find that as much. Oh, also, another difference is the young-er-the younger people are-they're more politically aware on a larger level. See a lot of the-a lot of the Americans- they're aware of-er-government of the United States and maybe a few other countries but not as many countries in Europe or they just have a vague understanding of how those other countries are run-not as widespread. Whereas here, I think that they- er-the kids get to know about how different countries are run at a much younger level and they know all about the United States and how it's run. Interviewer: What do you think the reasons are for that? Mathew: Urn-that's a good question-urn-well, I think that the reasons are-just because of the Press. You hear so much about America here that people are-they're into it-they want to know what it's about and how it's run. And so many of our policies in America affect Britain that they want to understand how policies are made and all that and seeing that that doesn't work on the other level like Britain's policies don't-I mean, they can affect us, but not to as great an extent and therefore you don't hear as much about Britain and people don't know as much about it., Question: What is the first strange thing the interviewee found?

(CNN) -- The jury weighing the fate of a white Florida man accused of killing a black teen during an argument over loud music concluded its second day of deliberations Thursday after asking a judge for details about a letter written in the months after the shooting. The jury was scheduled to resume deliberations Friday at 9 a.m. ET. The question was the latest posed by the jury considering the evidence in the case against Michael Dunn, who says he acted in self-defense when he opened fire on four teenagers in an SUV in Jacksonville in November 2012. Prosecutors contend it was an act of murder. Dunn has been charged with first-degree murder in the killing of 17-year-old Jordan Davis. He also has been charged with three counts of attempted murder. If Dunn is found guilty, he faces up to life in prison. Though","output":"the trial has been emotionally charged for both the victim's family and supporters of Dunn, the jury must evaluate the evidence objectively to reach a verdict. The letter requested by the jury may offer additional insight into Dunn's thought process and actions during the event, crucial in determining whether he truly believed he was in danger and acted in self-defense, or if he maliciously intended to harm the teens out of anger. Throughout the trial, both the prosecution and the defense have presented various witnesses and evidence, including the testimony of the other teens in the SUV and forensic evidence supporting each side's narrative. Key factors for the jury to consider include the severity of the perceived threat, the rationality of Dunn's reactions, and whether this response was proportionate to the situation. Ultimately, the jury will decide whether Dunn is guilty or not based on the evidence provided and their interpretation of the law. It is their responsibility to weigh the credibility of testimonies, as well as any potentially mitigating or aggravating factors. This case underscores the importance of a fair, impartial, and objective jury within the criminal justice system, as well as the ongoing discussions surrounding racial tensions, gun control, and self-defense laws in the United States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The last time this happened, it was when the iconic American brand digitally altered model Filippa Hamilton into a biologically impossible state, rendering her waist and pelvis in miniature and leaving the rest of her body normal-sized. Astute critics noticed and spoke up. It didn't help matters when Hamilton herself stated that she was allegedly fired by the brand for being \\"too fat\\" by fashion world metrics. More recently, however, the Ralph Lauren brand has made attempts to improve its image and hired Australian plus-size model Robyn Lawley, who stands 6-foot-2 and wears a size 12, for a print campaign. After the public relations nightmare with Hamilton, many have heralded this choice as a positive sign of improvement in a fashion industry that overwhelmingly hires and promotes models who are far thinner than the average American woman. The truth is, we want to see \\"real women\\" when they look like","output":"Robyn Lawley, but the fashion industry still has a long way to go in embracing body diversity and inclusivity. For years, the industry has perpetuated unhealthy standards of beauty by predominantly featuring models with extremely slender figures. This has not only led to a skewed perception of what a \\"normal\\" or \\"average\\" body should look like, but has also contributed to body-image struggles and disordered eating among many young women who may try to emulate these impossible norms. The most logical way to complete this passage would be to: Acknowledge that the industry has begun to take small yet significant steps toward broadening the types of bodies they represent. Brands like Aerie, Dove, and Fenty have pioneered a trend of embracing size and shape diversity, celebrating the beauty of different body types and urging the fashion world to follow suit. The hiring of Robyn Lawley by Ralph Lauren is a step in the right direction, but it is essential to recognize that one or a few campaigns don't signify a total transformation of the industry. Further, efforts must be made to challenge the fashion industry to not only embrace diverse body sizes but also be inclusive of different ethnicities, ages, abilities, and gender identities. Models like Ashley Graham, Tess Holliday, and Halima Aden have broken barriers in their respective categories, yet there is still much work to be done. Diversity and inclusion must become the norm, rather than being viewed as a quick public relations fix or a merely \\"trendy\\" move. Ideally, fashion should be a reflection of the wide range of people who inhabit our world, encompassing the multitude of shapes, sizes, and backgrounds that comprise \\"real women.\\" To truly address the root of the issue, educational programs and advocacy efforts should target the fashion industry at every level, from designers and editors to agents and photographers.

Heath only resigned when discussions on forming a coalition foundered, after which the Queen asked the Leader of the Opposition, Labour's Harold Wilson, to form a government.","output":"The title of this article could be: \\"The 1974 British General Election Crisis: Queen's Interruption and the Formation of Harold Wilson's Government\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Presley undertook three brief tours during the year, continuing to generate a crazed audience response. A Detroit newspaper suggested that \\"the trouble with going to see Elvis Presley is that you're liable to get killed.\\" Villanova students pelted him with eggs in Philadelphia, and in Vancouver the crowd rioted after the end of the show, destroying the stage. Frank Sinatra, who had famously inspired the swooning of teenage girls in the 1940s, condemned the new musical phenomenon. In a magazine article, he decried rock and roll as \\"brutal, ugly, degenerate, vicious. ... It fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people. It smells phoney and false. It is sung, played and written, for the most part, by cretinous goons. ... This rancid-smelling aphrodisiac I deplore.\\" Asked for a response, Presley said, \\"I admire the man. He has a right to say what he wants to say. He is a great success and a fine actor, but I think he shouldn't have said it. ... This is a trend, just the same as he faced when he started years ago.\\"Leiber and Stoller were again in the studio for the recording of Elvis' Christmas Album. Toward the end of the session, they wrote a song on the spot at Presley's request: \\"Santa Claus Is Back in Town\\", an innuendo-laden blues. The holiday release stretched Presley's string of number-one albums to four and would become the best-selling Christmas album ever in the United States, with eventual sales of over 20 million worldwide. After the session, Moore and Black—drawing only modest weekly salaries, sharing in none of Presley's massive financial success—resigned. Though they were brought back on a per diem basis a few weeks later, it was clear that they had not been part of Presley's inner circle for some time. On December 20, Presley received his draft notice. He was granted a deferment to finish the forthcoming King Creole, in which 350,000 had already been invested by Paramount and producer Hal Wallis.

Sentence: \\"I ate apple.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","output":"A linguist would likely rate the sentence, \\"I ate apple,\\" as acceptable linguistically depending on the context in which it is used and the criteria they are using to evaluate the sentence. For a more in-depth examination, let's consider the various components of the sentence and its overall structure from different linguistic perspectives. 1. Syntax: The sentence \\"I ate apple\\" follows the basic structure of a subject-verb-object (SVO) sentence, which is commonly used in English. In this case, \\"I\\" is the subject, \\"ate\\" is the verb, and \\"apple\\" is the object. From a syntactic perspective, the sentence appears acceptable, though it could be improved upon by adding \\"an\\" or \\"the\\" before \\"apple\\" to indicate that only one apple was eaten. 2. Semantics: Semantically, the sentence is mostly clear, as it conveys the meaning that the speaker consumed an apple. The lack of an article before \\"apple\\" might make the sentence sound less natural, but the essential meaning remains intact. A listener would still understand the general meaning of the sentence. 3. Pragmatics: Pragmatically, the sentence could be interpreted as acceptable in certain contexts where minimizing grammatical elements is useful. For instance, in informal communication, such as text messages or abbreviated notes, users often leave out articles or other parts of speech to conserve space and time. This could make the sentence acceptable in certain situations when brevity is prioritized. 4. Morphology: From a morphological standpoint, all the individual words in the sentence are correct and properly used. The verb \\"ate\\" is the past tense form of the verb \\"to eat,\\" and \\"apple\\" is a common, uncountable noun that can be used without an article in specific contexts. The subject pronoun \\"I\\" is used correctly in this sentence. 5. Sociolinguistics: In the realm of sociolinguistics, which considers the social context and variation among speakers of a language, the sentence might be considered acceptable depending on the situation and the regional usage of English. Some English dialects or speakers may use this sentence structure without issue, while others might consider it non-standard or less sophisticated. In conclusion, a linguist may rate the sentence \\"I ate apple\\" as acceptable linguistically, depending on the specific context in which it is used and the criteria being prioritized. While the sentence could be improved by adding an article (\\"an\\" or \\"the\\") before \\"apple,\\" the overarching meaning is still clear to a listener. Depending on the context and linguistic perspective, the sentence could be understood and deemed acceptable, even if it may not adhere to standard English grammar rules universally."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You can usually tell when someone is happy based on seeing them smile,hearing them laugh or perhaps from receiving a big hug.But can you also smell their happiness? Surprising new research suggests that happiness does indeed have a scent,and that the experience of happiness can be transmitted through smell,reports Phys.org. For the study,12 young men were shown videos meant to bring about a variety of emotions while researchers gathered sweat samples from them.All of the men were healthy and none of them were drug users or smokers,and all were asked to abstain from drinking or eating smelly foods during the study period. Those sweat samples were then given to 36 equally healthy young women to smell,while researchers monitored their reactions.Only women were selected to smell the samples,apparently because previous research has shown that women have a better sense of smell than men and are also more sensitive to emotional signaling--though it's unclear why only men were chosen to produce the scents. Researchers found that the behavior of the women after smelling the scents--particularly their facial expressions--indicated a relationship between the emotional states of the men who produced the sweat and the women who sniffed them. \\"Human sweat produced when a person is happy brings about a state similar to happiness in somebody who breathes this smell,\\" said study co-author Gun Semin,a professor at Koc University in Turkey. This is a fascinating finding because it not only means that happiness does have a scent,but that the scent is capable of transmitting the emotion to others.The study also found that other emotions,such as fear,seem to carry a scent too.This ensures previous research suggesting that some negative emotions have a smell,but it is the first time this has proved to be true of positive feelings. Researchers have yet to isolate  exactly what the chemical compound for the happiness smell is,but you might imagine what the potential... Question: What is the main finding of the new research? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Pleasant feelings can be smelt out.\\"? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the main finding of the new research is that pleasant feelings, such as happiness, can be smelled. The study showed that human sweat produced when a person is happy can induce a similar state of happiness in someone who breathes in that smell.

Gregory Peck's brilliant portrayal of Douglas MacArthur from the Battle of Corregidor in the Philippines at the start of the Pacific War largely through to his removal as UN Commander during the Korean War offers reason to believe all three of the above possibilities. Certainly the most controversial American General of the Second World War (and possibly ever) MacArthur is presented here as a man of massive contradictions. He claims that soldiers above all yearn for peace, yet he obviously glories in war; he consistently denies any political ambitions, yet almost everything he does is deliberately used to boost himself as a presidential candidate; he obviously believes that soldiers under his command have to follow his orders to the letter, yet he himself deliberately defies orders from the President of the United States; he shows great respect for other cultures (particularly in the Philippines and Japan) and yet is completely out of touch with his own country. All these things are held in balance throughout this movie, and in the end the viewer is left to draw his or her own conclusions about the man, although one is left with no doubt that MacArthur sincerely and passionately loved his country, and especially the Army he devoted his life to. Peck's performance was, as I said, brilliant - to the point, actually, of overshadowing virtually everyone else in the film (which is perhaps appropriate, given who he was portraying!) with the possible exception of Ed Flanders. I though he offered a compelling look at Harry Truman and his attitude to MacArthur: sarcastic (repeatedly referring to MacArthur as \\"His Majesty,\\") angry, frustrated and finally completely fed up with this General who simply won't respect his authority as President. Marj Dusay was also intriguing as MacArhur's wife Jean, devoted to her husband (whom she herself referred to as \\"General,\\" although their relationship seems to have been a happy enough one.) I very much enjoyed this movie, although perhaps would have liked to have learned a little more about MacArthur's early life. I have always chuckled at MacArthur's reaction to Eisenhower being elected President (\\"He'll make a fine President - he was the best damn clerk I ever had\\" - which seems to sum up what MacArthur thought the role of the President should be, especially to his military commanders during wartime.)

Summarize: Europe's Charley Hull and fourball partner Suzann Pettersen beat Alison Lee and Brittany Lincicome, of the United States, on Sunday after Lee picked up her ball. Lee, 20, thought an 18-inch putt had been conceded as Hull had walked away. But Pettersen said they had not conceded and the hole went to Europe who won two up on the 18th. Both Hull and Lee, playing in her first Solheim Cup, had to be consoled by team officials amid claims Europe had broken the game's moral code by not conceding from such a short distance. Four-time major winner Laura Davies blamed Norwegian Pettersen, 34, and said England's Hull, 19, was not at fault. The Hall of Fame member told Sky Sports: \\"I am disgusted. Suzann has let herself and her team down.\\" US captain Juli Inkster thought Europe's action was \\"disrespectful\\". She added: \\"I couldn't believe it. I saw Suzann walk away. You don't do that to your peers. \\"I expected Carin (Koch, Europe captain) to do something afterwards but she didn't.\\" Koch said it was Lee's mistake, adding: \\"Our team didn't concede the putt. She picked it up. It broke the rules. \\"We considered changing the outcome but we would not have given the putt. They would have made her putt it. So, no. \\"We all feel bad for Alison but she made a mistake.\\" Europe went into Sunday's singles in a strong position after Karine Icher and Catriona Matthew birdied the last two holes of their fourball to beat Lizette Salas and Brittany Lang 2&1.

Minnesota is located in the upper Midwest region of the United States and has a long international border with the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Manitoba. The border between Minnesota and Canada stretches approximately 547 miles (881 kilometers), with the majority of the border shared with the province of Ontario. A key feature of this border is the Rainy River, which flows westward from Lake of the Woods to the Lake of the Woods-Rainy River drainage divide. The border is further demarcated by the line running through the middle of Lake Superior in the south, which separates Minnesota from the Canadian province of Ontario. Minnesota is known as the \\"Land of 10,000 Lakes\\" due to its vast number of freshwater lakes, and it is home to the headwaters of the Mississippi River, which begins at Lake Itasca.

If you want to add significance to the process, you can use coins minted in years that mean something, such as your birth year. You can also purchase old Chinese coins if you want to add authenticity to the process. 2. Prepare your mind: Before beginning the consultation, take a few moments to quiet your mind and center yourself. Reflect on the question or situation you want guidance on, and formulate it as clearly as possible in your mind. 3. Toss the coins: Hold the three coins in your hand and silently ask your question or focus on your situation. Then, toss the coins gently onto a flat surface. 4. Interpret the results: Each coin has two sides - heads and tails. For the purpose of I Ching, assign a value of 3 to heads and a value of 2 to tails. Add up the values of the three coins. The result will be either 6, 7, 8, or 9. Each number corresponds to a specific I Ching line: - 6: A changing yin line (represented by a broken line with an X) - 7: A solid yang line (represented by an unbroken line) - 8: A broken yin line (represented by a broken line) - 9: A changing yang line (represented by an unbroken line with a circle) 5. Record the line: Draw the corresponding line at the bottom of a piece of paper or on a separate document. 6. Repeat the process: Toss the coins five more times, interpreting each result and recording the corresponding line above the previous one. This will give you a total of six lines, forming a hexagram. 7. Look up the hexagram: Consult an I Ching reference book or search online to find the specific hexagram formed by your six lines. Read the interpretation and consider how it relates to your question or situation. 8. Apply the changes: If you received any changing lines (lines with an X or a circle), these lines transform into their opposites, creating a new hexagram. Look up the meaning of the new hexagram as well, to gain further insight into how the situation may change or develop over time. Consider the guidance provided by the I Ching in the context of your own intuition and life experience. As you practice consulting the I Ching, you may find that your understanding and interpretation of the hexagrams deepen and become more personal to you. Remember that the I Ching is an ancient and profound system of divination, but ultimately, your own inner wisdom and judgment should guide your actions and decisions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

[-] vegetables were fresh.. [-] fruits were fresh..","output":"The sentence ends as:  I ate a lot less vegetables than I ate fruits, because the fruits were fresh. This ending suggests that the distinction between the individual's consumption of vegetables and fruits was predominantly influenced by the freshness of the fruits. It implies that the freshness of the fruits enhanced their appeal to the individual, making them more desirable and palatable in comparison to the vegetables. Fresh fruits are often vibrant in color, juicy, sweet, and filled with flavor, which encourages their consumption by many people. Moreover, the preference for fresh fruits may also demonstrate awareness about the health benefits that they offer. Fresh fruits are packed with an array of vital nutrients including vitamins, minerals, and fiber. They are known to lower blood pressure, reduce the risk of heart disease, and aid in digestive health. Additionally, the natural sugars found in fruits provide a healthier energy source than artificial, processed sugars.  However, while fruits are an essential component of a balanced diet, vegetables also pack a variety of health benefits, and are a good source of dietary fiber, providing essential vitamins like vitamin A, vitamin K and vitamin B6, dietary minerals including magnesium, dietary fiber and a variety of phytochemicals, such as beta-carotene. Some studies suggest that diets rich in vegetables reduce the risk of certain types of cancer and other chronic diseases. Thus, it is crucial to maintain a balance and include both fruits and vegetables in one's diet.  You can say that the freshness of fruits has driven this particular individual's dietary preferences. But this preference may fluctify once fresh vegetables become available or the individual decides to incorporate more vegetables into their diet. After all, a balanced diet requires the intake of a variety of nutrients, which can be gained from diversity in food consumption.  All in all, the sentence \\"I ate a lot less vegetables than I ate fruits, because the fruits were fresh\\" serves to highlight personal eating tendencies in the context of food freshness, possibly reflecting on health-conscious decisions as well."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? a fascinating curiosity piece -- fascinating , that is , for about ten minutes","output":"The sentiment of the movie review sentence \\"a fascinating curiosity piece -- fascinating, that is, for about ten minutes\\" is mixed but leaning more towards negative. Initially, the review presents a positive sentiment, as evidenced by the use of the adjective \\"fascinating.\\" This adjective generally implies that the movie has captured the reviewer's interest in a compelling manner. The description of the movie as a \\"curiosity piece\\" also initially appears to be positive. It suggests that there is some unique, engaging aspect to the film that sets it apart from others. However, the latter part of the sentence, \\"fascinating, that is, for about ten minutes,\\" changes the overall tone of the sentiment by introducing a significant limitation to the positive aspects mentioned earlier. This addition implies that while the movie may have been interesting and unique in the beginning, its appeal only lasted for a short time - ten minutes, to be precise. This significantly lowers the overall positive sentiment by suggesting that the movie is unable to sustain the interest promised at the start. Thus, while the movie review sentence starts on a positive note, it ultimately conveys dissatisfaction with the film's inability to maintain its initial charm or fascination. The resulting sentiment can be described as mixed but skewing towards the negative, as it implies that the viewer's experience deteriorated after the initial ten minutes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: Double car bomb explosion killed four and injured at least 46 as blasts struck outside the headquarters of the court bailiffs' service in the capital of Russia’s Dagestan Republic, Makhachkala.      The first car with the explosive placed underneath reportedly went off causing no fatalities or injuries. Once law enforcement arrived at the scene, the second bomb detonated, Interfax reported citing the local Investigative Committee.      “As far as I know there are three people dead. One of them is our employee,” spokesperson of the Court Bailiffs' Service Magomed Buttaev told RT.      The death toll rose to four people after another man, an employee of the court bailiffs' service, died of his injuries in hospital, according an Interior Ministry spokesman.            Initial reports suggested eight people died at the scene, Interfax news agency reported.      “Two cars were detonated within several minutes. At least eight people have been killed, while the number of injured is being clarified. More than 20 cars have been damaged,” the agency quoted the representative of Dagestan’s Investigative Committee.            However, the chief physician in Dagestan, Kazanfar Kurbanov, has later confirmed that three people died and 24 were injured.      “There have been 46 people hospitalized,” Interfax reported citing its source.            As said, the blasts occurred approximately 15 minutes apart from each other with the two bombs were detonated remotely.            Interfax quotes a source who said that an explosive was also found in a trash can.            “It has already been established that the first explosive was placed under the car,” one of the spokesman told media.      The force of the second blast was the equivalent of up to 50 kg of TNT, Rasul Temirbekov from the local Investigative committee told ITAR-TASS, adding that the first blast was less powerful, nearly causing damage to nearby parked cars.            According to law enforcement officials, perpetrators clearly used a tactic which is quite common in Dagestan, when the first blast is bait to attract more people and the second explosion goes off when people are at the scene, thus injuring and killing law enforcement members.      “The majority of injured are police officers who arrived at the scene after the first blast. There are at least 15 of them now,” ITAR-TASS quotes the local Interior Ministry.      Russia’s Emergencies Ministry has sent doctors and psychologists from Moscow to Makhachkala. The IL-76 jet will deliver 26 specialists to Dagestan, and then return with victims of the blast to Moscow hospitals if needed.      No one has claimed responsibility for the double blast, with no suspects yet identified. Investigators have said they will use the registration plates of one of the vehicles involved, in a bid to track down the culprits.            “We plan to ID the owner of the exploded car and unravel the case trough this information,” an investigative committee spokesperson said. There's a belief that the car was stolen.

MAKHACHKALA, Russia Two car bombs killed at least four people and wounded dozens of others on Monday in one of the bloodiest attacks this year in Dagestan, a turbulent province in Russia's North Caucasus region where armed groups are waging an Islamist insurgency.      Car bombs, suicide bombings and firefights are common in Dagestan, at the center of an insurgency rooted in two post-Soviet wars against separatist rebels in neighboring Chechnya.      Such attacks are rare in other parts of Russia, but in a separate incident in a suburb of Moscow on Monday, security forces killed two suspected militants alleged to have been plotting an attack in the capital and arrested a third suspect after a gunbattle.      One elite police officer was lightly wounded in the exchange of gunfire with the suspects - Russian citizens but trained in Afghanistan or Pakistan - who had holed up in a home in the town of Orekhovo-Zuyevo east of Moscow, authorities said.      Investigators initially said eight people had been killed by the successive blasts in Dagestan's provincial capital Makhachkala, but law enforcement and health officials later put the death toll at four and said about 40 people were wounded.      The explosions occurred with the space of a few minutes near the headquarters of the court bailiffs' service and appeared to have been detonated by remote control, said the federal Investigative Committee, a Russian state agency.      Twisted wreckage of a car could be seen near the building, which was cordoned off by police, and blackened chunks of metal lay in the street.      The Health Ministry said 35 people remained in hospital, including one child, a few hours after the blasts, which the Investigative Committee called a \\"terrorist act\\".      The main suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings in the United States, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, lived in Dagestan with his family about a decade ago and visited the region last year.      The visit by Tsarnaev, who was shot dead by U.S. police after the April 15 bombings that killed three people and wounded 264 others, is being scrutinized by U.S. investigators for signs of ties with insurgents.      Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered law enforcement authorities to ensure insurgents do not attack the 2014 Winter Olympics next February in the Black Sea resort city of Sochi, which is close to the North Caucasus.      All those wounded or killed were apparently caught by the second of Monday's explosions, a few minutes after the first, the investigators said.      Insurgents in the North Caucasus have often sought to increase casualties by setting off an initial blast to attract law enforcement officers and then detonating a second bomb.      Dagestan, an ethnically mixed, mostly Muslim region between Chechnya and the Caspian Sea, has become the most violent province in the North Caucasus, where insurgents say they are fighting to carve out an Islamic state out of southern Russia.      At least 405 people were killed in Dagestan in violence linked to the insurgency last year, according to the Caucasian Knot website, which tracks developments in the region.      Putin launched the second war in Chechnya as prime minister in 1999 and likes to take credit for preventing the region from splitting from Russia. But his 13 years in power have been marred by deadly attacks claimed by or blamed on the insurgents.      (Writing by Steve Gutterman; editing by Timothy Heritage and Jon Hemming) ||||| Makhachkala, Dagestan (CNN) -- At least four people are dead and 44 are injured after two bombs exploded Monday in Russia's volatile North Caucasus region, the Ministry of Health's website says.      Thirty-one of the injured were hospitalized, it says.      The incident -- which occurred in Makhachkala, capital of the semi-autonomous republic of Dagestan -- also caused significant damage. Security officials say they believe law enforcement officers may have been the target because the explosion occurred outside a local marshal's building.      One car bomb was discovered by a police patrol, who called in a unit to defuse it. Before that could be done, the bomb went off, but the explosion was minor, security officials said. Then, as a crowd of people gathered, a second, more powerful device detonated, causing the casualties.

The brothers are ethnic Chechens who lived in Kyrgyzstan and Dagestan.      Authorities who've been investigating how the brothers became radicalized are interested in a trip Tamerlan Tsarnaev took to Dagestan last year.      Russian authorities asked U.S. officials to investigate Tsarnaev before the trip, saying they believed he was becoming increasingly involved with radical Islam. The FBI investigated, but found no evidence of extremist activity, FBI Director Robert Mueller told a Senate committee.      Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is in custody. His older brother died after a shootout with police just outside Boston days after the bombing.

On the day that France surrenders to Nazi Germany in 1940, Prudence \\"Pru\\" Cathaway a strong-willed young woman from the upper class, joins the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, a military organisation linked to the Royal Air Force, to her family's surprise. Her aunt Iris and uncle Wilbur disapprove since she has chosen to serve as a private rather than as an officer. However, family butler Parsons privately expresses his support. She goes off to training camp, where she makes friends with fellow WAAF Violet Worthing. As a favor to Violet, Prudence agrees to go on a double date one night; she is paired with Clive Briggs, a moody mysterious man with a dark secret. He seems to her rather bitter about something and is indifferent, even hostile, to her aristocratic background, but she likes him, and he asks her out again. Romance blooms. On a holiday together on the southern coast, Pru twice overhears Clive talking in his sleep. The second time, she wakes him up, but he does not want to talk about it. Then his friend Monty shows up. When the three go to dinner, Pru learns from Monty that Clive is up for a Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions during the Dunkirk evacuation. While Pru is dancing with someone else, Monty pleads with Clive to return with him. He was given a month's sick leave, but that was over two months ago, and he is about to be posted as a deserter.  Finally, Clive tells Pru, indirectly, about his predicament and that he no longer wants to fight for the benefit of an English elite that oppresses and humiliates people of his class. Pru makes an impassioned plea for all the good things that England represents, but when she wakes up the next morning, Clive has gone, leaving her a letter of goodbye.

Might her husband be wandering?","output":"Yes, the word \\"wander\\" is used in the same way in both sentences; however, the context and implications differ between the two. The word \\"wander\\" in both sentences is used as a verb to indicate movement or travel with no specific destination or purpose. In both cases, \\"wander\\" involves a leisurely, aimless, or undirected manner of travel. The primary difference lies in the nature of the scenarios and the subjects involved. In the first sentence, \\"To wander over the fields,\\" the context suggests that the act of wandering is a voluntary, purposeful, and possibly enjoyable endeavor. It implies that someone chooses to roam around the fields without a particular goal in mind. This form of wandering might refer to someone searching for inspiration, exploring nature out of curiosity, or simply seeking a break from everyday routine. In the second sentence, \\"Might her husband be wandering?\\" the context is more uncertain and possibly has a disconcerting tone. The question's phrasing suggests that the wife might be concerned about her husband's whereabouts or state of mind. His wandering could imply several scenarios: he might be lost physically or emotionally, possibly experiencing mental health issues, or he might even be unfaithful. In this sentence, the act of wandering has a negative or potentially problematic connotation. In both sentences, the word \\"wander\\" conveys a similar meaning of aimless travel.

Answer:","output":"Given the information provided, I will determine what Jesse might want to do next by considering various factors. Step 1: Analyze the context Jesse pleased Lee's father, likely by demonstrating good character traits or extending a helpful gesture. As a result, Jesse was rewarded for this kind act. Step 2: Consider Jesse's motivation It is possible that Jesse's motivation for the initial kindness was a genuine desire to help or out of a sense of compassion. Alternatively, Jesse could have acted with the goal of receiving a reward or gaining favor. Step 3: Reflect on potential actions If Jesse's motivation was primarily altruistic or caring, they may want to continue their helpful actions, build a deeper relationship with Lee and their family, or extend a similar kindness to others. If Jesse's motivation was focused on receiving a reward, assessing the value of their reward would provide insight into what they could do next. If the reward was significant or fulfilling, they may consider continuing their relationship with Lee's family or being kind to others with the hope of maintaining favor or receiving additional rewards. Step 4: Determine the most likely action Taking into account both the altruistic and reward-based motivations, Jesse might want to: 1. Further strengthen their relationship with Lee and their family, as relationships can provide emotional support, long-lasting friendships, and potential future opportunities. 2. Continue being kind to others to maintain a positive reputation, which can open doors to various social or professional opportunities.

AFP - Australia will appeal directly to Singapore's president to spare the life of a Vietnamese-Australian facing execution for smuggling heroin into the city-state, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said.","output":"The situation described in the excerpt is about the Australian government's plan to appeal to the President of Singapore to spare the life of a Vietnamese-Australian citizen facing execution for smuggling heroin into Singapore. In this case, the individual involved is a Vietnamese-Australian, which means they have a connection with Australia either by birth, naturalization, or any other legally recognized means. It is not uncommon for countries to make diplomatic appeals on behalf of their citizens who are facing serious legal consequences in foreign countries, especially when it comes to the death penalty. The Foreign Minister of Australia, Alexander Downer, announced the Australian government's intention to appeal directly to Singapore's president. This suggests that the government of Australia has taken an active role in advocating for leniency in this case. Diplomatic appeals, such as the one mentioned here, are usually made in cases where the government of the citizen's home country believes that the punishment does not fit the crime, or that there may be humanitarian grounds for clemency. Singapore is a country with strict laws and regulations, especially in regards to drug crimes. Possessing, trafficking, manufacturing, importing, or exporting illicit drugs are offenses that are punishable by law, often resulting in severe penalties. Singapore's Misuse of Drugs Act imposes a mandatory death penalty for certain types and amounts of drugs being trafficked or smuggled. This harsh stance towards drugs is rooted in Singapore's belief that drug abuse and addiction have the potential to destroy the social fabric, and thus, their tough laws serve as a deterrent to people engaging in such activities. In this specific case, the Vietnamese-Australian faced execution for smuggling heroin into Singapore. It is not mentioned whether the execution is imminent or if there is still an ongoing judicial process. Nevertheless, the Australian government's decision to intervene indicates that they believe there might be justifiable reasons for leniency. Such reasons could include the individual's personal background, circumstances leading to the crime, or any mitigating factors that may warrant a reduction in punishment. In appealing directly to the President of Singapore, the Australian government is seeking the highest level of intervention possible. The President of Singapore, in certain cases, has the constitutional authority to grant pardons or commutation of sentences. However, this power is typically exercised sparingly and is solely at the discretion of the President. In conclusion, this situation pertains to the Australian government's efforts to save the life of a Vietnamese-Australian citizen who is facing execution in Singapore for smuggling heroin into the country. Foreign Minister Alexander Downer announced Australia's intention to appeal directly to Singapore's President, hoping to secure clemency on humanitarian grounds or due to any mitigating circumstances. The case highlights the complex interplay between international diplomacy, national drug policies, and the rights of individuals facing severe legal consequences abroad."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

'Get Me Roger Stone' documentary offers good insight into the dark forces behind Trump's rise.      Political consultant Roger Stone attends a screening of \\"Get Me Roger Stone\\" at the SVA Theatre during the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival on April 23, 2017 in New York. (Photo: Brent N. Clarke, Brent N. Clarke/Invision/AP)      “I was like a jockey looking for a horse. You can’t win the race if you don’t have a horse. He’s a prime piece of political horse flesh in my view.” – Roger Stone on Donald Trump.      A grapefruit-size grinning face of Richard Nixon is tattooed on the back of Roger Stone, the longtime political operative and legendary dirty trickster. Stone, 64, credited with propelling Donald Trump into politics, defends the tattoo proudly in an early scene from Get Me Roger Stone, the fascinating and instructive new documentary recently released on Netflix.      Anyone trying to keep up with the daily drama emanating from the White House lately — from President Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey to the multiple Russia investigations to the Comey memos — could benefit from a screening of this film.      The documentary follows Stone from his earliest days in politics, as a 19-year-old neophyte performing dirty tricks for Nixon’s 1972 re-election campaign and the youngest person called to testify in front of the Watergate grand jury, to his close involvement in Trump's surprising win last year.      I had heard of Roger Stone, of his gutter-level tactics, his conspiracy theories and his close ties to Trump. But I had little idea of the depth of influence he’s had on American politics the past five decades and on the current White House tenant. Like others, I've been intrigued by the forces that propelled Trump to the presidency and so deeply divided our nation. Get Me Roger Stone offers some of the best insight into this I've seen anywhere.      Interestingly, the filmmakers — Morgan Pehme, Dylan Bank and Dan DiMauro — met Stone six years ago and planned to do a movie focusing on his influence on American politics. They had gathered five years worth of footage on Stone before the 2016 presidential campaign even began. But as Trump marched through the primaries, with Stone ever-lurking in his shadows, they realized they had something much bigger.      Their goal was not to make a liberal, finger-wagging hit piece, DiMauro told me, but a film that peeled back the veneer of modern political campaigning and explained how Stone — and others like him — have muddied modern political discourse.      “Sunlight is the best disinfectant,” DiMauro said. “By making this film, we wanted people to understand the profound effect (Stone) has had on our politics and the degradation of political discourse over the past 50 years.”      Co-director Pehme said he hopes viewers of the film realize elections are about more than just the candidates. \\"We are painfully naive about the fact that the most powerful people, the people really moving our country, are the people behind the camera, in the shadows, like Roger Stone,\\" he said.      After Watergate, the film follows Stone through his Forrest-Gump-like political career: Working on the campaigns of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush; peddling access in the influential D.C. lobbying firm of Black, Manafort and Stone (known as the “Torturer’s Lobby” for taking on clients such as Zaire's dictator Mobutu Sese Seko and Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines); pioneering negative TV ads through political-action committees; orchestrating street protests on behalf of George W. Bush during the 2000 Florida presidential election recount.      “Those who say I have no soul, those who say I have no principles, are losers,” Stone says in the film.      In 1987, Stone began urging Trump to run for president. In the film, Trump praises Stone repeatedly, calling him “tough” and a “quality guy.” In one sequence, the film shows how Stone helped sabotage the Reform Party’s chances in the 2000 presidential election by urging Pat Buchanan to run as a Reform candidate, then backing Trump to run against Buchanan. In part because of Trump’s brash attacks on his rival (“He’s a Hitler lover,” Trump repeatedly says about Buchanan), the Reform Party imploded, paving the way for Bush’s contentious win that year.      Stone’s fingerprints, according to the film, were again all over Trump’s victory last year: the “Make America Great Again” slogan (borrowed from a Reagan campaign Stone worked on); questioning President Obama’s birth certificate; spreading unfounded allegations that Bill Clinton is a serial rapist. Stone's name has also been mentioned in connection to the widening FBI inquiry into Russia's interference in the 2016 election.      “Roger’s relationship with Trump has been so interconnected that it’s hard to define what’s Roger and what’s Donald,” Paul Manafort, Stone’s ex-partner and Trump’s former campaign manager, says in the film.      Toward the end of the movie, Stone is seen inside a stretch limo winding its way through midtown Manhattan. It's after the November elections and Stone is aglow with his protégé's victory.      \\"This is the manifestation of a dream I've had since 1988,\\" he says. \\"I always thought Donald Trump had the size and the courage ... to become president of the United States.\\"      The camera follows Stone as he exits the limo and disappears into Trump Tower.

Realitatea este că, cu un buget care reprezintă doar 2 % din cheltuielile publice ale UE, urmărirea unor politici ambițioase în toate sectoarele va fi dificilă. Translate to English","output":"The reality is that, with a budget representing only 2% of the EU's public spending, pursuing ambitious policies in all sectors will be difficult. The European Union's relatively small budget, accounting for just 2% of its total public expenditure, poses a significant challenge when it comes to achieving ambitious goals across various sectors. Addressing these challenges will require a strategic approach and collaborative efforts among member countries. First and foremost, it is important to recognize the limitations of the EU's financial resources in the context of its diverse policy sectors, which include economic development, agriculture, infrastructure, education, climate change, and more. Given that each sector requires substantial funding to implement concrete and transformative initiatives, the EU's current budgetary constraints hinder its capacity to support ambitious projects in every sector simultaneously. Despite these limitations, the EU has already made great strides in various policy areas. For instance, it has demonstrated considerable progress in areas such as regional development, climate change mitigation, and digital innovation. By leveraging its resources and working in close partnership with its member states, the EU has been able to drive lasting and tangible change across these crucial sectors. To further address the challenge posed by the limited budget, the EU needs to adopt innovative approaches to funding, as well as to policy design and implementation. In doing so, the EU could prioritize the most efficient and effective funding mechanisms that allow for the maximum impact to be achieved with limited resources. For example, the European Investment Bank (EIB) can play a crucial role in offering loans and guarantees to support private investment in key strategic industries and infrastructure projects. Additionally, the EU should continue to focus its efforts on fostering cooperation and collaboration among member countries to pool resources and generate synergies across sectors. By sharing expertise and best practices, the EU can increase the efficiency of policy implementation and maximize the impact of its budget. Furthermore, the EU should actively explore opportunities to collaborate with other international organizations and the private sector in order to enhance its financial and operational capacities. This not only includes tapping into new funding sources but also fostering knowledge exchange and technological cooperation to tackle shared challenges effectively. In conclusion, while the relatively modest budget of the European Union presents difficulties in pursuing ambitious policies across all sectors, strategic efforts in prioritizing funding mechanisms and fostering collaboration among member states and international partners can help amplify the EU's impact. By leveraging its resources in the most efficient and effective manner, the EU can continue to drive transformational change across various sectors, fulfilling its role as a global leader and ensuring sustainable development for its citizens."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Did you ever wonder how a microwave works?

Write a text based on this summary: russia 's black sea fleet beefs up security after lighthouse seizure Text:","output":"Title: Russia Enhances Security Measures for its Black Sea Fleet Following Lighthouse Seizure  In recent developments, the Russian Black Sea Fleet has found itself increasing security measures in order to safeguard its strategic assets and maintain stable operations in the region. This move comes after the seizure of a lighthouse situated on the Black Sea coast. The lighthouse holds great significance for a number of reasons, which is why it has garnered such extensive attention.  The Black Sea is a crucial area for international maritime traffic and is a central economic corridor for both Russia and Europe. The Black Sea Fleet is an integral part of this maritime domain and serves as the core of Russia's naval power in the region. The seizure of the lighthouse has placed a spotlight on the vulnerability of these strategic landmarks, prompting the defense establishment to reinforce the security protocols in place.  It is imperative to understand the strategic importance of the lighthouse in question. Lighthouses provide essential navigational aid to mariners and assist in facilitating safe routes for vessels passing through congested waters. This particular lighthouse, situated along the Black Sea coast, has a rich history and aids in crucial navigation along these waters. Its seizure has not only affected the smooth interoperability of maritime vessels but has also created a sense of insecurity, prompting the Russian authorities to tighten the security measures around its Black Sea Fleet.  In response to the growing concerns, the naval authorities have initiated a comprehensive review of the existing security infrastructure and have identified key areas for improvement. Simultaneously, efforts are being made to procure and deploy advanced surveillance equipment to ensure better situational awareness in the area. These modern technological tools will be employed to maintain round-the-clock vigilance, providing an enriched level of security and threat detection. Another important aspect of the revised security measures is the increased collaboration among the various stakeholders involved in securing the maritime domain. The Russian defense establishment is now working closely with counterparts from neighboring countries to bolster interoperability and refine joint response mechanisms. This regional cooperation is aimed at enhancing mutual trust and promoting a unified approach towards addressing security challenges emerging in the Black Sea.  In light of these mutual concerns, the participating nations are engaging in joint naval exercises designed to strengthen tactical proficiency and improve overall readiness. Additionally, the exchange of information on maritime threats and potential vulnerabilities is being actively encouraged. This intelligence sharing is critical in updating the threatscape and paving the way for a cooperative approach to maritime security in the Black Sea.  In conclusion, the seizure of the lighthouse along the Black Sea coast has prompted the Russian Black Sea Fleet to reassess its security posture and take decisive measures to reinforce its protection. The multi-pronged strategy entails enhancing surveillance capabilities, strengthening regional cooperation, and conducting naval exercises in an effort to provide a secure environment for maritime traffic. It is through these comprehensive initiatives that Russia aims to maintain its strategic interests in the Black Sea and minimize any potential repercussions resulting from this incident."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Information:  - Techno is a form of electronic dance music that emerged in Detroit, Michigan, in the United States during the mid-to-late 1980s. The first recorded use of the word \\"techno\\" in reference to a specific genre of music was in 1988. Many styles of techno now exist, but Detroit techno is seen as the foundation upon which a number of subgenres have been built.  - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows:  European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity.  - Tech house is a subgenre of house music that mixes elements of techno with house. The term \\"tech house\\" developed as a shorthand record store name for a category of electronic dance music that combined musical aspects of techno, such as \\"rugged basslines\\" and \\"steely beats,\\" with the harmonies and grooves of progressive house. The music originally had a clean and minimal production style that was associated with techno from Detroit and the UK. In the mid to late 1990s a scene developed in England around club nights such as The Drop run by Mr.C & Plink Plonk, Heart & Soul, and Wiggle run by Terry Francis and Nathan Coles. Other DJs and artists associated with the sound at that time included Charles Webster, Bushwacka!, Cuartero, Dave Angel, Herbert, Funk D'Void, Ian O'Brien, Derrick Carter, and Stacey Pullen. By the late 90's London nightclub The End, owned by the former Shamen rapper Richard West (Mr C) and Layo Paskin, was considered the home of tech house in the UK. Tech house tracks are typically between 610 minutes in length.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - Trance is a genre of electronic music that developed during the 1990s in Germany. It is characterized by a tempo lying between 125 and 150 beats per minute (BPM), repeating melodic phrases, and a musical form that distinctly builds tension and elements throughout a track often culminating in 1 to 2 \\"peaks\\" or \\"drops.\\" Although trance is a genre of its own, it liberally incorporates influences from other musical styles such as techno, house, pop, chill-out, classical music, tech house, ambient, and film music.  - Matthias Paul, better known by his stage name Paul van Dyk (born 16 December 1971 in Eisenhüttenstadt, East Germany) is a German Grammy Award-winning DJ, record producer and musician. One of the first true superstar DJs, Paul van Dyk was the first artist to receive a Grammy Award nomination in the newly added category of Best Dance/Electronic album for his 2003 release \\"Reflections\\". He was named the World's number one DJ in both 2005 and 2006, something only few DJs have ever achieved. He was the first ever DJ to be named number one by \\"Mixmag\\" in 2005. By 2008, he had sold over 3 million albums worldwide.  - The Politics of Dancing 2 is an album of trance music mixed by Paul van Dyk as a sequel to his The Politics of Dancing .  - Mixmag is a British electronic dance and clubbing magazine, published in London, England. Launched in 1982, the magazine covers dance events, and reviews music and club nights.  - East Germany, formally the German Democratic Republic or GDR, was an Eastern Bloc state during the Cold War period. From 1949 to 1990, it administered the region of Germany that was occupied by Soviet forces at the end of World War IIthe Soviet Occupation Zone of the Potsdam Agreement, bounded on the east by the OderNeisse line. The Soviet zone surrounded West Berlin, but did not include it; as a result, West Berlin remained outside the jurisdiction of the GDR. The German Democratic Republic was established in the Soviet Zone, while the Federal Republic was established in the three western zones. East Germany was a satellite state of the Soviet Union. Soviet occupation authorities began transferring administrative responsibility to German communist leaders in 1948, and the GDR began to function as a state on 7 October 1949. Soviet forces, however, remained in the country throughout the Cold War. Until 1989, the GDR was governed by the Socialist Unity Party (SED), though other parties nominally participated in its alliance organisation, the National Front of Democratic Germany.   - Eisenhüttenstadt (literally \\"ironworks city\\" in German) is a town in the Oder-Spree district of the state of Brandenburg, Germany, on the border with Poland. It had a population of 32,214 as of 31 December 2008.

Mount Danxia, the World Heritage Site containing spectacular red-striped sandstone landscape, including two bizarrely realistic (male and female) phallic rock formations, is in which country?","output":"Mount Danxia, also known as Danxia Mountain, is located in China. More specifically, it is situated in the Renhua County, Shaoguan City of Guangdong Province, which is in the southeastern part of the country. The Danxia landforms, known for their colorful and spectacular red-striped sandstone landscapes, are unique geological formations found mainly in Southwestern China and are a stunning display of the earth's natural beauty. In 2010, UNESCO recognized Mount Danxia as a World Heritage Site, placing it under the combined title of \\"China Danxia.\\" This designation encompasses six inscribed landform groups across China, including Mount Danxia, each featuring distinctive and visually breathtaking examples of these unique sandstone formations. Mount Danxia is particularly famous for two phallic rock formations, one representing male genitals and the other representing female genitals. These formations, known as the \\"Yangyuan Stone\\" (male) and the \\"Yinyuan Hole\\" (female), have become a major attraction for tourists visiting the area, often drawing attention for their realistically shaped appearances. The Yangyuan Stone stands 28 meters tall, while the Yinyuan Hole reaches approximately 10 meters in diameter. These formations, together with the rest of the Danxia landforms, have resulted from millions of years of weathering and erosion processes acting upon red sandstone. Horizontal layers of sandstone have been exposed and shaped through natural forces such as wind, rainwater, and geological shifts, leading to the formation of unique and dramatic cliffs, mesas, and other geological features. The striking red and orange stripes that make Danxia landscapes famous are caused by variations in the iron content and oxidation levels over time. In addition to these geological wonders, Mount Danxia also boasts a rich history and cultural heritage. It is known for its numerous ancient temples, including the Zhanglao Temple, which dates back to the Tang Dynasty (618-906), and the Biezhuan Temple, a Buddhist site home to an impressive collection of stone carvings and statues. In conclusion, Mount Danxia, home to the spectacular red-striped Danxia landforms and the male and female phallic rock formations, is located in the Guangdong Province of China. Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of the China Danxia designation, it offers visitors an opportunity to witness the breathtaking beauty and the extraordinary natural formations that are the result of millions of years of geological processes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Bjorn Borg was born in Stockholm, Sweden, on 6 June 1956, as the only child of Rune and Margaretha Borg. He grew up in nearby Sodertalje. As a child, Borg became fascinated with a golden tennis racket that his father won at a table-tennis tournament. His father gave him the racket, beginning his tennis career. With 11 Grand Slam titles, Borg ranks sixth in the list of male tennis players who have won the most Grand Slam singles titles behind Roger Federer (20), Rafael Nadal (16), Pete Sampras (14), Roy Emerson (12), and Novak Djokovic (12). The French Open--Wimbledon double he achieved three times consecutively was called by Wimbledon officials \\"the most difficult double in tennis\\" and \\"a feat considered impossible among today's players.\\" Only Nadal (in 2008 and 2010) and Federer (in 2009) have managed to achieve this double since, and Andre Agassi, Nadal, Federer and Djokovic are the only male players since Borg to have won the French Open and Wimbledon men's singles titles over their career. Ilie Nastase once said about Borg, \\"We're playing tennis, and he's playing something else\\".  In his 1979 autobiography, Jack Kramer, the long-time tennis promoter and great player himself, had already included Borg in his list of the 21 greatest players of all time. And in 2003, Bud Collins chose Borg as one of his top-five male players of all time.  In 2008, ESPN.com asked tennis analysts, writers, and former players to build the perfect open era player. Borg was the only player mentioned in four categories: defense, footwork, intangibles, and mental toughness--with his mental game and footwork singled out as the best in open era history.  Borg famously never won the US Open, losing in the final four times. Borg also never won the Australian Open, as he only played in the event once, in 1974 as a 17-year-old. The only players to defeat Borg in a Grand Slam final were fellow World No. 1 tennis players John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors. Even though it was then played on grass, a surface where he enjoyed much success, Borg chose to play the Australian Open only once, in 1974, where he lost in the third round. Phil Dent, a contemporary of Borg, has pointed out that skipping Grand Slam tournaments--especially the Australian Open--was not unusual then, before counting Grand Slam titles became the norm. Additionally, another contemporary Arthur Ashe told Sports Illustrated, \\"I think Bjorn could have won the U.S. Open. I think he could have won the Grand Slam, but by the time he left, the historical challenge didn't mean anything. He was bigger than the game. He was like Elvis or Liz Taylor or somebody.\\" Was there anything else important to happen with Borg?","output":"Bjorn Borg's career was filled with several important milestones and events. Apart from his 11 Grand Slam titles, Borg also had a remarkable rivalry with fellow tennis legends John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors, which added drama and excitement to the tennis world in the 1970s and 1980s. Some important highlights from Borg's career and life include: 1. Davis Cup Success: Borg was a key player in helping Sweden win the Davis Cup in 1975, 1978, and 1980. His performances in these events were crucial for Sweden's success in the international tournament and further solidified his status as one of the top players in the world. 2. Record Winning Streak: In 1978, Borg set a then-record for the longest winning streak in the Open Era by registering 49 consecutive victories. This incredible run showcased Borg's consistency and dominance on multiple surfaces, as it included title wins on clay, grass, and hard courts. His record has since been broken, but it remains a testament to Borg's extraordinary skills and relentlessness. 3. Retirement and Comeback: Borg shocked the tennis world when he announced his retirement in 1983 at the young age of 26. His decision to step away from the game came after he grew disillusioned with the sport and the lifestyle it demanded. However, Borg attempted a comeback in the early 1990s but struggled to find success. His comeback was hampered by his refusal to adapt to modern equipment and the increased level of competition. Eventually, Borg retired for good in 1993. 4. Impact on Tennis Fashion: Throughout his career, Borg was known for his unique sense of style both on and off the court. His iconic headband and Fila-sponsored clothing became synonymous with the Swede's image, leading to an increase in tennis apparel sales and helping popularize the sportswear industry. 5. Personal Life: Borg's personal life saw its share of ups and downs, with tabloid reports chronicling relationships, marriages, and divorces. He was married to Romanian tennis pro Mariana Simionescu, followed by a second marriage to Italian singer Loredana Bertè. After his split with Bertè, Borg married Patricia Östfeld, with whom he has a child. 6. Post-Retirement Ventures: In addition to his brief comeback, Borg has explored several business opportunities since retiring from professional tennis. The most notable of these is the Bjorn Borg fashion brand, which focuses on sportswear and fashion clothing. The brand has since achieved international success and has expanded into other product lines such as fragrances and footwear. In conclusion, Bjorn Borg's impact on tennis goes beyond his impressive on-court achievements. He was an influential figure in the sport, inspiring a generation of athletes with his unique playing style, fashion sense, and undeniable charisma. His rivalry with fellow tennis greats like John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors added depth and passion to the sport, while his remarkable achievements and personal journey continue to inspire and captivate fans around the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Morten Per Olsen (born 14 August 1949) is a Danish football manager and former football player. He was the head coach of the Danish national team for 15 years from 2000 until 2015, guiding Denmark to the 2002 FIFA World Cup, 2004 European Championship, 2010 FIFA World Cup and 2012 European Championship. He has also managed Brondby IF to two Danish Superliga championships and Ajax to the Double of the 1998 Dutch Eredivisie championship and Dutch Cup trophy. Olsen made his debut for the Denmark under-21 national team in September 1970, scoring a single goal in a 2-2 friendly match draw with the Poland U21s. Three weeks later, he was called up for the senior Danish national team under the Austrian national team manager Rudi Strittich, and Olsen made his national team debut in September 1970 against Norway. He played his first national team game as a right winger, but eventually settled as a defensive midfielder. He helped Denmark qualify for the 1972 Summer Olympics, but could not participate at the tournament, as he had signed a professional contract with Cercle Brugge beforehand.  While at Anderlecht, Olsen became the seventh Dane to play 50 games for the national team, in June 1981. For Olsen's 53rd national team game in April 1983, the German national team manager of Denmark, Sepp Piontek, named Olsen permanent national team captain, as Olsen replaced the retiring Per Rontved as both libero and team captain. Olsen played as an attacking libero, and had defensive midfielder Jens Jorn Bertelsen cover for him when he was on the attack. Olsen, alongside defender Soren Busk, persuaded Piontek to implement the aggressive off-side trap they practiced at Anderlecht.  Olsen captained the Danish team that qualified for the 1984 European Championship; Denmark's first international tournament participation since the 1972 Olympics. Denmark reached the semi-finals, before being eliminated by Spain on penalty shootout. In October 1985, Olsen became the second Dane, after Per Rontved, to play 75 national team matches. He captained Denmark at the 1986 World Cup, Denmark's first World Cup participation, which ended in a second round defeat to Spain. Olsen's most noticeable effort at the tournament came in the 2-0 group stage win against West Germany. He took the ball from his own half and made an irresistible dribbling run that was only stopped by a foul in the West German penalty area, with Jesper Olsen scoring the 1-0 goal on the resulting penalty kick. Olsen was identified as one of the overall top performers at the World Cup, and he was subsequently named 1986 Danish Player of the Year.  While he was moved to a midfielder position at Koln, Olsen continued to play as a libero for Denmark. He captained Denmark at the 1988 European Championship, which ended in the preliminary group stage. During the tournament, Olsen proved too slow for the libero position, and was moved up as defensive midfielder, leaving the libero position for Lars Olsen. Morten Olsen ended his international career following the 1988 European Championship, having played 99 national team games, but was called up again 10 months later. Olsen became the first Dane to play 100 games for the national team in April 1989, before ending his national team career in June 1989. Olsen played a record 102 games and scored four goals for the national team, and set a record of 50 games as Danish national team captain. His team captain record was broken by Lars Olsen in 1992, while his game tally was bested by Peter Schmeichel in 1998. In his entire international career, Morten Olsen only got one yellow card.

Here is an article: Doris Payne in a Las Vegas courtroom in 2005.Photo: AP To steal a diamond worth nine figures from Cartier in Monte Carlo, you’d think you would need an “Ocean’s Eleven”-caliber team with big funding, a sleek cat-burglar wardrobe and at least one team member who can do parkour through a laser security force field. But Doris Payne, then in her 40s, did it all on her own with just simple sleight of hand. Payne, now 83, has been a jewel thief for 60 years, having stolen more than 2 million in goods. She is the subject of the new documentary, “The Life and Crimes of Doris Payne,” which begins a two-week run at Film Forum on Wednesday. Raised in West Virginia and Ohio, Payne spent her childhood watching her father beat her mother. When she was 23, she finally did something about it. She had been preparing for some time. “When [Payne] was a teenager, a store owner showed her some watches. She put one on her wrist, and when a white man walked in, the store owner asked her to leave because he didn’t want to be seen serving a black girl,” says Kirk Marcolina, who co-directed the film. “She walked out of the store, but realized she still had the watch on. She gave it back, then spent her teenage years perfecting that art.” Now, Payne walked out of a store in Pittsburgh wearing a diamond ring. For the first time ever, she didn’t give it back, and gave it to her mother to pay for her to escape the abuse. Payne poses in this undated photo provided by her family.Photo: AP But while Payne may have had noble motives the first time, she found herself addicted to the rush. Payne’s blend of charm and smarts has led to shocking successes, including her greatest heist — the Monte Carlo job in the early 1970s. Payne took a taxi to Cartier and asked the driver to wait. She entered the store, dropped a ring in her pocket and left. When she got back in the cab, she looked at what she had taken and almost fainted. “I looked at that ring and saw nine zeros,” said Payne, who had unknowingly stolen a 10-carat diamond. “The first thing I said to myself was, ‘You should not have done this.’ ” Police caught her at the airport, and she had to think fast. So she put the ring in her mouth. The cops came up empty. Payne put a tissue up to her face, as if to blow her nose. With her mouth covered, she spit the ring into the tissue and dropped it into her boot. Still, police were sure of her guilt. Monte Carlo did not have a facility for female criminals, so they booked her into a four-star hotel, where she requested a nail clipper, needle and thread. She used the clipper to pry the diamond from its mount and sewed the gem into her girdle. Authorities never found it, but Payne was sentenced to three years. Shortly after, nuns brought her to a health clinic, where they asked if she needed to use the bathroom. She went in, snuck back out and hailed a cab. Payne flew to New York, and within two hours of landing sold the jewel in the Diamond District for 148,000 (746,000 today). The film also covers the trial she was embroiled in at the time of filming, for stealing a 9,000 ring from a San Diego Macy’s. Throughout the film she claims innocence, despite the fact that she’s been convicted more times than she remembers — nine times before 1999, plus several since — and has escaped from jail almost as many. In the end, one of her smallest heists earns her one of her longest sentences. Payne in her cell at Clark County jail in 2005 after she was convicted of stealing a 9,000 diamond ring from a San Diego Macy’s.Photo: AP Most recently, on April 28, Payne pleaded guilty to stealing a 22,500 ring from a jeweler in Palm Desert, Calif. She was sentenced to two years in prison and two on house arrest. Due to her age, Marcolina expects Payne to be out before she completes her sentence. Still, it’s hard to imagine her not stealing. “She has such a lovely and mischievous way about her,” says co-director Matthew Pond, “and yet she’s proud of what she did. “One of the reasons she wanted to make the movie is that she’s proud of how smart she’s been.” 1. Payne never dresses too fancy when stealing in America, lest she stand out, although the appearance of status means more in Europe. 2. At a store, she requests several pieces to look at, then creates chaos: trying things on, taking them off, shuffling them around the top of the case. 3. She distracts a salesperson by asking for yet another item, then grabs a jewel — though not the one she’s hoping to steal. 4. Payne asks for the jewel she took, and when the distressed salesperson can’t find it, the piece suddenly turns up. This is how Payne earns their trust. 5. Having tempered suspicion, she waits for an opportune moment, takes the jewel she wants, and walks casually out of the store.

Write a summary based on this article: A leading palliative care nurse with no serious health problems has ended her life at a Swiss suicide clinic because she did not want to end up as a “hobbling old lady”.      Gill Pharaoh, 75, who wrote two books giving advice on how to care for the elderly, was not suffering from a terminal disease.      She said she had seen enough of old age to know that she was “going over the hill” and wanted to take action to end her life while she was able to do so.      Speaking before her death in Basel, the mother of two said her experience as a nurse, including working in nursing homes, had shown her that the reality of old age was “awful”.      She told The Sunday Times: “I have looked after people who are old, on and off, all my life. I have always said, ‘I am not getting old. I do not think old age is fun.’ I know that I have gone just over the hill now. It is not going to start getting better. I do not want people to remember me as a sort of old lady hobbling up the road with a trolley.      “I have got so many friends with partners who, plainly, are a liability. I know you shouldn’t say that but I have this mental picture in my head of all you need to do, at my age, is break a hip and you are likely to go very much downhill from that.”      Gill Pharaoh and her partner John (Julian Andrews)      She said her partner and children had supported her wishes, though it would not have been their choice.      In the interview before her death on July 21, she said her daughter, Caron, a nurse, had struggled particularly with the decision.      The pensioner is one of a growing number of Britons who are choosing an assisted death in Switzerland.      Last year a study found that one in five of the 611 people who travelled to Switzerland to end their lives between 2008 and 2012 were from the UK.      A spokesman for Care Not Killing, which campaigns against assisted dying, said: “This is another deeply troubling case and sends out a chilling message about how society values and looks after elderly people in the UK.”      In May a father with cancer ended his life at the Swiss clinic Dignitas against the wishes of his family, despite admitting “I know I am going too early.”      Jeffrey Spector, who had a tumour on his spine but was not terminally ill, died at the Zurich hospital because he feared he would become paralysed.      In a final interview given hours before he died Mr Spector, 54, admitted: “I am jumping the gun. Do not judge me.\\"      However, Dr Michael Irwin, the co-ordinator of the Society for Old Age Rational Suicide (Soars), who helped the retired nurse with her plans to go to Switzerland, said: “Some will say that Gill was wrong to avoid the expected decrepitude of ‘old age’ but, having seen much suffering as a palliative care nurse, she took the rational decision that . . . she preferred to have a pre-emptive, doctor-assisted suicide.”      The former nurse had no major health problems, and was on no medication. She said she suffered from intermittent back pain following a bout of shingles, and had tinnitus.      Gill as a student nurse taken in 1959 (Julian Andrews)      But she said she felt she was going downhill “in an almost imperceptible way” as she grew older.      “I would rather go out when I am not quite at a peak. I have dropped off a bit but I want to be still me, recognisably me and not have people look and think, ‘Oh, are you Gill, were you Gill?” she said. “A lot of people are very good until they are 70 and then they start sloping off a bit.”      She was accompanied to Lifecircle, the assisted-dying clinic in Basel, by John.      Portrait of Gill Pharaoh and her partner John (Julian Andrews)      On the eve of her death, the couple wandered through the city before enjoying a meal on the banks of the Rhine.      “The whole evening was very tranquil and enjoyable,” said John. “I think it is what we both wanted. Gill had been thinking about it for years and I had no intention of spoiling it by getting emotional and heavy.”      The former nurse said her children and partner had struggled with her decision.      “It is not his [John’s] choice at all and my kids are backing me, although it is not their choice,” she said before the journey to Switzerland. “My daughter is a nurse and she said, ‘Intellectually, I know where you are coming from but emotionally I am finding it really hard,’ and I know she is.”      Her partner called her children after the death. A humanist memorial service, arranged by Ms Pharoah, will take place later this month.      Two months before her death, Gill wrote an article, entitled My Last Word, in which she set out her decision to end her life.      “Day by day, I am enjoying my life. I simply do not want to follow this natural deterioration through to the last stage when I may be requiring a lot of help,” she wrote.      “I have to take action early on because no one will be able to take action for me. The thought that I may need help from my children appals me. I know many old people expect, and even demand, help from their children but I think this is a most selfish and unreasonable view.”      She said her experience as a nurse had shown her the reality of elderly life.      “If you work in a nursing home and you have people who are incontinent, who use bad language, who walk around the rooms and just take things, it is very difficult. It is not a job you enjoy,” she said.      “I just felt it was so bleak and so sad. We all did what we could but, for many of those old people, there wasn’t a lot you could do. We do not look at the reality. Generally, it is awful.” ||||| Healthy nurse, 75, chooses death over ‘going downhill’      Gill Pharoah with her partner John (Julian Andrews)      A HEALTHY and active former palliative care nurse has ended her life at a Swiss suicide clinic because she did not want to become “an old lady hobbling up the road with a trolley”.

Choose from: a. negative b. positive Short movie review: a heavy stench of \` been there , done that ' hanging over the film  Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"Based on the short movie review, it is clear that the critic was thinking negatively of the movie. The phrase \\"a heavy stench of 'been there, done that' hanging over the film\\" indicates a sense of disappointment and dissatisfaction with the overall experience. The choice of words plays a critical role in conveying the critic's unfavorable opinion. The term \\"heavy stench\\" creates a strong and vivid image of something unpleasant or repulsive, suggesting that the movie has a strong air of unoriginality or predictability. Moreover, the quote \\"been there, done that\\" implies that the critic feels the movie is formulaic or derivative, as if it brings nothing new or interesting to the table. Furthermore, this negative review may also imply that the critic felt the movie lacked innovation, freshness, or creativity – qualities that are essential for a film to stand out and leave an impact on the audience. Consequently, the reviewer's choice of the term \\"hanging over the film\\" might be an indication that this unoriginality is pervasive and consistently present throughout the movie's runtime, further enhancing the negative tone of the review. In conclusion, it is evident that the critic's opinion of the movie is negative, based on the choice of displeasing imagery and a sense of disappointment that the movie did not offer anything new or captivating. By pointing out the film's lack of originality and innovation, the critic leaves potential viewers with the idea that the movie may not be worth watching, effectively establishing a negative viewpoint."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Given the question: I had seen it before, those fuzzy, furry leaves and stalks, with the pretty, star-pointed purple flowers, but up until that moment that I saw them sitting in a basket at the market stalls, I admit I had never taken notice of it as a food. It grow along cracks in stone walls and along the roadside near my home in Settignano, which is blooming with spring goodness right now: robinia (black locust) trees, wild garlic (three-cornered leek) and even elderflowers are already bursting. I asked the vendor just to double check, “Is this borage?” “Si,” Came the answer, “Borragine.” He confirmed. “I’ve had it in ravioli,” I started to say, “Brava!” He said, as if we were about to start a guessing game on what could be done with it. Actually, there’s a lot that can be done with it. If you can use it as a ravioli filling with ricotta, then you can imagine it taking the place of spinach in gnudi, too, but also soups or frittata or stirred through polenta. I learned that the flowers are just as delicious, if not more interesting, for their delicate cucumber-like flavour — people told me of their use in salads or cocktails like Pimms, and someone even mentioned she freezes them in ice cubes, what a pretty idea for those first warm nights when you can dine al fresco, homemade cocktail in hand. Then there’s risotto and of course the fritters, much like these ones.

The writer describes their experience of seeing borage at a market stall, asking the vendor about it, and learning about its various culinary uses. They also mention taking home a bag of borage, which indicates that they purchased the flowers for themselves to experiment with in cooking and explore its versatility as a food ingredient."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

One revealing glimpse into the Akin worldview: May 24, 2005, Akin's speech denouncing stem cell research on the House floor. It's a marvel of right-wing paranoia in which he fantasizes about what will happen if stem cell research continues—if it reaches what he calls \\"step three\\"—based on a story about harvesting organs from real humans that his daughter wrote:      My own daughter wrote a little story—I will read it—about step three. \\"I live with 40 others in a compound, supervised by cool, efficient orderlies.

Article: A deal has been signed to turn by-products from a Scottish distillery into fuel for cars. In what is declared to be a world first, the Tullibardine distillery in Perthshire has linked up with a spin-out company from Napier University in Edinburgh. They plan to use bacteria to feed on the \\"leftovers\\" from the whisky making process. This will produce butanol which can be used to fuel vehicles. More than 90% of the stuff that comes out of a whisky distillery is not whisky. It is leftovers like draff and pot ales -- both produced in the early stages of the process. They are high in sugar and are currently used for things like fertiliser and cattle feed. Napier University's Biofuel Research Centre (BfRC) has already shown that the right bacteria can feed on those by-products to produce butanol--a direct replacement for vehicle fuel. Now the spin-out company, Celtic Renewables, and independent whisky producer Tullibardine have signed an agreement. Together they will apply the process to thousands of tons of the distillery's leftovers. Professor Martin Tangney, founder of Celtic Renewables, said \\"Our partnership with Tullibardine is an important step in the development of a business which combines two important Scottish industries -- whisky and renewables. This project shows that creative use of existing technologies can _ resources on our doorstep to benefit both the environment and the economy.\\" Douglas Ross, managing director of Tullibardine, which spends PS250,000 disposing of its by-products every year, said \\"We are delighted to be partnering Celtic Renewables in this creative business, the obvious benefits of which are environmental. It takes a cost to us and turns it into something that has social as well as commercial value.\\" The project is being supported by a grant  from the Scottish government's Zero Waste Scotland initiative. Celtic Renewables said it eventually aimed to build a processing plant in Scotland, with the hope of building an industry that could be worth PS60m a year. Question: How do people deal with whisky leftovers at present? Options: A: They throw them away. B: They use them to feed people. C: They use them to feed bacteria. D: They use them for crops or cattle. Answer:","output":"D: They use them for crops or cattle. Currently, the by-products or leftovers from the whisky production process, such as draff and pot ales, which are produced in the early stages and make up over 90% of the distillery's output, are used for things like fertiliser for crops and cattle feed. These by-products are high in sugar, making them suitable for these purposes. The deal signed by the Tullibardine distillery and Celtic Renewables plans to introduce a new method of dealing with these by-products - by using bacteria to feed on them and produce butanol, a direct replacement for vehicle fuel. However, as of now, these leftovers are typically used in agriculture - either in aiding the growth of crops or as a nutritional supplement for livestock. Therefore, option D is the most accurate answer to the question \\"How do people deal with whisky leftovers at present?\\" since leftovers are those used for either crops or livestock, rather than thrown away or used to feed people or bacteria."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The revelation that Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri are possibly residing in houses in northwest Pakistan, enjoying relative comfort and protection from locals and members of the Pakistani intelligence services, is a cause for concern. It is essential for the Pakistan government to address this issue and work collaboratively with international stakeholders to ensure that the al Qaeda leadership can no longer evade justice. To begin with, the Pakistan government must enhance its internal counterterrorism measures, focusing specifically on areas where bin Laden and al-Zawahiri are suspected to be hiding. This will require an increase in intelligence gathering and surveillance efforts, as well as strengthening the government's ability to act upon critical information swiftly. This may involve allocating additional resources and personnel to areas such as Chitral, close to the Chinese border, and the Kurram Valley, adjoining Afghanistan's Tora Bora. Furthermore, the Pakistan government should engage in close cooperation and intelligence sharing with its neighboring countries, particularly Afghanistan, to ensure a more comprehensive and effective approach to counterterrorism. Partnerships with international organizations such as NATO can provide valuable support in these efforts, and the Pakistan government must be open to receiving assistance and utilizing intelligence gathered by international stakeholders. Moreover, it is crucial for the government to address the concerns of protecting members of the al Qaeda leadership within its intelligence services. Thorough investigations must be carried out, and if necessary, reforms should be implemented to ensure that individuals within these agencies are held accountable for any actions supporting terrorist organizations. To strengthen the credibility and efficacy of its intelligence services, the Pakistan government should also focus on training and education programs for its operatives in the area of counterterrorism and intelligence gathering. Lastly, it is important for the government to address the root causes of extremism within the country and work to inhibit the recruitment of new members into terrorist organizations. This can be achieved through social and educational initiatives, aimed at integrating marginalized or vulnerable communities into mainstream society and reducing the appeal of extremist groups. It is essential for the Pakistan government to recognize that addressing these issues is not only important for the security of its own nation but also has significant implications for regional and global security. By taking prompt and decisive actions, the government can prevent terrorist organizations from evading justice and help to create a safer and more stable environment for all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a text based on this summary: us lawmakers press china on trade disputes Text:","output":"Title: U.S. Lawmakers Urge Tackling Trade Disputes with China Introduction In recent times, a growing number of U.S. lawmakers have begun pressing China on various trade disputes, emphasizing the urgency in resolving the long-standing issues between the two economic powerhouses. With a focus on the areas of contention, the lawmakers are seeking a more level playing field and calling for transparent dialogue between the United States and China to promote fair trade practices and mutual economic growth. Trade Disputes and Concerns Over the past few years, the trade relationship between the United States and China has experienced increased tensions. One of the primary concerns is the ballooning trade deficit that has emerged between the two countries, which reached a staggering 315.1 billion in 2020. This deficit has sparked worries among U.S. politicians, business leaders, and economists, as it highlights the growing reliance of the United States on Chinese imports. Another significant issue contributing to trade disputes is Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) receiving substantial subsidies. Lawmakers assert that these subsidies create an unfair advantage for Chinese companies over their U.S. counterparts. Moreover, concerns about intellectual property (IP) theft and forced technology transfers have further exacerbated the situation. Furthermore, the Made in China 2025 initiative, China's strategic plan to upgrade its manufacturing sector, has raised eyebrows in the U.S. The program aims to increase the Chinese share of core components and materials in the global market, which could potentially threaten the competitiveness of U.S. industries. Lawmakers' Actions and Demands In response to these disputes, U.S. lawmakers are urging the Biden administration to take a firm stance on trade issues with China. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have called for a comprehensive strategy to ensure that future trade agreements with China address key concerns, such as the protection of intellectual property rights, stringent regulations against subsidies for state-owned enterprises, and restrictions on forced technology transfers. Additionally, U.S. lawmakers are pressing for a thorough review of the existing trade deal with China, known as Phase One. They argue that the deal, which was implemented under the Trump administration, does not adequately address the root causes of the disputes and must be revised. With new tariffs on Chinese goods implemented by the Trump administration still in place, they also argue that the impact of these tariffs should be assessed to determine their effectiveness in leveling the playing field for U.S. businesses. Towards Transparent Dialogue and Long-standing Solutions U.S. lawmakers see transparent dialogue as crucial to resolving the trade disputes between the United States and China. One proposed solution is the establishment of a high-level, ongoing dialogue between the two countries that focuses on economic and trade issues. By engaging in open discussions, the U.S. and China can work together to rectify trade imbalances and promote mutually beneficial economic growth. Through a combination of revised trade agreements, open dialogue, and strong government actions, U.S. lawmakers aim to create a level playing field for businesses in both countries. Developing a comprehensive, sustainable, and fair trade policy will benefit not only the economies of the United States and China, but the global economy as a whole. Conclusion The pressing of China on trade disputes by U.S. lawmakers reflects the urgency in addressing the ongoing issues in the trade relationship between the two nations. With demands for a comprehensive strategy that tackles unfair subsidies, IP theft, forced technology transfers, and trade imbalances, lawmakers are pushing for transparency and sustainable solutions in hopes of building a more equitable and mutually beneficial economic relationship. By working together and engaging in honest, open dialogue, the United States and China can pave the way for a future of shared prosperity and global economic growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For more specific discussions of poetry and theater, see Poetry of the United States and Theater in the United States. During its early history, America was a series of British colonies on the eastern coast of the present-day United States. Therefore, its literary tradition begins as linked to the broader tradition of English literature. However, unique American characteristics and the breadth of its production usually now cause it to be considered a separate path and tradition.  - Finca Vigía (\\"Lookout Farm\\") was the home of Ernest Hemingway in San Francisco de Paula Ward in Havana, Cuba. Now like his Key West property, Finca Vigía is now a museum.  - Since 1901, the Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded annually to an author from any country who has, in the words of the will of Alfred Nobel, produced \\"in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction\\" (original Swedish: \\"den som inom litteraturen har producerat det mest framstående verket i en idealisk riktning\\"). Though individual works are sometimes cited as being particularly noteworthy, here \\"work\\" refers to an author's work as a whole. The Swedish Academy decides who, if anyone, will receive the prize in any given year. The academy announces the name of the chosen laureate in early October. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895; the others are the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Physics, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.  - Ernest Miller Hemingway (July 21, 1899  July 2, 1961) was an American novelist, short story writer, and journalist.

Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954. He published seven novels, six short story collections, and two non-fiction works. Additional works, including three novels, four short story collections, and three non-fiction works, were published posthumously. Many of his works are considered classics of American literature.  - Cuba, officially the Republic of Cuba, is a country comprising the island of Cuba as well as Isla de la Juventud and several minor archipelagos.

Q: The lungs of mammals are unique in having what?   Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  The lungs of mammals are unique in having alveoli . These are tiny, sac-like structures. Each alveolus is surrounded by a network of very small blood vessels (see Figure below ). Because there are millions of alveoli in each lung, they greatly increase the surface area for gas exchange between the lungs and bloodstream. Human lungs, for example, contain about 300 million alveoli. They give the lungs a total surface area for gas exchange of up to 90 square meters (968 square feet). That’s about as much surface area as one side of a volleyball court!.

Any painter can benefit from the presence of a live model from which to draw. Does the word \\"presence\\" mean the same thing in the above two sentences?","output":"In the two sentences you provided, the word \\"presence\\" is used in different contexts and thus carries different meanings. Let's elaborate on the usage of \\"presence\\" in each sentence: 1. \\"I'm convinced that there was a presence in that building that I can't explain, which led to my heroic actions.\\" In this sentence, \\"presence\\" refers to a feeling or sensation experienced by a person, possibly something supernatural, mysterious, or inexplicable. This type of presence is often associated with paranormal events or beliefs, such as the feeling that a ghost or otherworldly entity is nearby or influencing one's actions. In this context, \\"presence\\" is an abstract and often intangible concept that may not necessarily have a concrete, physical manifestation. The presence felt here could simply be an atmosphere or energy that the speaker sensed but couldn't rationalize or explain. 2. \\"Any painter can benefit from the presence of a live model from which to draw.\\" Here, \\"presence\\" refers to the physical existence or appearance of a live model in the painter's studio, workspace, or observational environment. In this context, \\"presence\\" indicates that the model is actually available, in-person, to be viewed, studied, and captured on canvas or paper by the artist. In this situation, \\"presence\\" is tangible and easily described and demonstrated, as it refers to an actual person occupying the same space as the painter. In conclusion, while the word \\"presence\\" is used in both sentences, it takes on unique meanings based on the context in which it appears. In the first sentence, \\"presence\\" denotes an unexplainable, abstract feeling or sensation that influenced the individual's actions. Conversely, in the second sentence, \\"presence\\" represents the physically observable existence of a live model for the benefit of an artist. The variability in meaning demonstrates the flexibility of the English language and highlights the importance of context in understanding the intended message of a word or phrase."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Now let's compare the premise and hypothesis. Comparison: Based on the premise, the preference is for companies to engage in trash management without incurring huge costs. The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that everyone would pay a significant amount of money to deal with trash.

Question: There are various aspects that go into making a successful school, and success can be measured in various ways. Often, the teachers are praised for a school's success and blamed for its failure. Yet, in order for a school to be effective, it must be a place where teaching and learning can easily take place, and that requires the hard work of more than just educators. Students must take learning into their own hands and feel as if what they are doing is as important as it actually is. This can only be done with the cooperation of every adult that is involved in the students' life. Some of these individuals often go unnoticed, yet the role they play in the students' lives is immeasurable. In the school, administrative assistants greet students at the start of the day and answer a large quantity of questions. When an assistant remembers a student's name or even something special about that student, it communicates to him that he is cared for. The assistant can also give that extra encouragement for a student to make better choices, especially when they are visiting the principal's office. Meanwhile, though cafeteria workers have a short space of time to interact with students, they can make a big difference as well. Beyond meeting nutritional needs, cafeteria workers may also on occasion meet the emotional needs of the students they serve. Students benefit from positive interaction with adults, and cafeteria workers may give that extra bit of encouragement that a child needs. Custodians   are usually underappreciated for what they offer to schools. They have to be knowledgeable about everything from cleaning to fixing the most intricate   tools. They get to school early in the morning before teachers arrive and lock up late at night after the last student has left from the after-school event. They also make sure teachers are equipped with the necessary items and prepare the rooms so that they are ready for learning. A great custodian also gives that kind word or extra smile to that student who needs it most. If an assistant remembers a student's name, the student will feel that   _  .

The boys are trained from an early age to be professional, international hitmen-for-hire. Years later, Interpol agent Mike Whittier arrives at his house and discovers Agent 47, where the two talk about 47's life as a professional hitman, working for a mysterious unknown paramilitary group known as The Organization. Three months prior, 47 (Timothy Olyphant) is completing a hit on a gang leader named Bwana Ovie in Niger. He is told by his Organization contact, Diana, to kill his next target, Russian President Mikhail Belicoff publicly. He completes his mission, but before he can leave Russia, he is contacted by his employers. They tell him that there is a witness to the assassination and order him to intercept her. When Agent 47 realizes she has never seen him before, he does not shoot her, instead, he narrowly avoids an assassination attempt on himself, attempted by another unknown Agent. His employers reveal his location to agents of FSB, who make plans to intercept him. As he is about to be taken, Diana calls to warn him and that Belicoff ordered the hit. After an escape from the hotel, 47 intercepts Nika, Belicoff's mistress, the woman who supposedly witnessed his hit. He interrogates her about Belicoff and discovers that Belicoff had a body double, who ordered the hit on the real Belicoff so that he could take his place as the president of Russia. 47 was to be killed after the hit to ensure total secrecy.

There are no lush rugs or stylish furniture. The large table in the conference room is simple varnished wood. Offices are small and mostly plain, except for the eclectic mix of pop art, African statuary and neon that adorns litigation director Webb Brewer's space. Brewer, who has been at the agency 20 years, said there is a need for lawyers of all stripes to help with the problems of the poor. \\"The private bar could meet more of the need through pro bono work, but there are still cases that involve the systemic problems for low-income people that we would need to do,\\" said Brewer. \\"The legal system marketplace just doesn't serve low-income people too well, except in fee-generat-ing type cases,\\" Brewer said. \\"If a poor person gets run over by a bus, an attorney might take that case because they might be able to recover part of the damage award as attorney fees.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"If the perturbation hypothesis suggests that there is a reduction in the number of zygotes implanting into the uterus, it would indeed have a direct effect on producing less babies. This could happen due to various reasons, such as issues related to fertility in either partner, problems with the uterus lining, or other health factors affecting the process. The reduction of zygote implantation would lead to decreased pregnancy rates and subsequently, fewer babies being born. This would directly impact the overall population growth and also affect families and individuals who are trying to conceive. Additionally, this perturbation could lead to more people seeking fertility treatments and interventions in order to have children, which may result in a larger reliance on assisted reproductive technologies, increased health care costs, and potential emotional and mental stress for those affected.

Neither the latitude for government speech nor its rationale applies to subsidies for private speech in every instance, however. Does it follow that \\"Government speech applies to private speech.\\"? Choose from:  --yes  --it is not possible to tell  --no","output":"The statement \\"Neither the latitude for government speech nor its rationale applies to subsidies for private speech in every instance, however\\" essentially implies that there are situations where the principles and reasoning behind government speech do not apply to private speech in cases when subsidies are involved. This indicates that the specific context and circumstances would determine how the government and private speeches relate to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to simply conclude that \\"Government speech applies to private speech\\" on a universal basis. Government speech refers to the speech that is an official expression of the government's policies, opinions, and viewpoints as it seeks to communicate its intentions with the public. Meanwhile, private speech includes the opinions, expressions, and ideas of individuals or non-government organizations that are often protected under freedom of speech. When it comes to subsidies for private speech, the government may provide financial support to certain individuals or organizations to enhance their ability to convey their ideas, allowing them to reach a wider audience. This support does not necessarily mean that such private speeches are a direct reflection of the government's opinions or policies. At times, the government may promote a plurality of voices, ideas, or opinions, facilitating a healthy and diverse marketplace of ideas. In such cases, even as the government subsidizes private speech, it is not directly controlling or dictating the content. In such scenarios, one cannot simply state that \\"Government speech applies to private speech.\\" However, there may be situations where the government provides subsidies in a way that influences private speech directly, as it aligns more closely with the government's policies or opinions. In such cases, the line between government and private speech may become blurred. These specific instances would require a deeper and nuanced analysis to determine the extent of the government's influence over private speech. In conclusion, it is challenging to make a blanket statement in this matter, as it depends on the context and circumstances. While there may be cases where government speech may directly or indirectly apply to private speech, especially in instances involving subsidies, it is important to evaluate how the latitude and rationale of government speech operate in each specific situation before drawing conclusions. Thus, the most suitable answer would be \\"it is not possible to tell.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Process:  - A forest fire starts - The trees and plants burn - The animals lose their homes - If the animals can not escape, they may die from smoke inhalation - The plants that provide food are gone - The animals have little to eat -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose animals will have more to eat happens, how will it affect a SMALLER negative effect on animals.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"If the perturbation hypothesis that animals will have more to eat after the forest fire happens, it will have a smaller negative effect on animals. The supposed perturbation could have a direct or indirect effect on the process. Direct effect: If animals have more to eat, it indicates that there might be some alternative food sources that emerge within the burnt forest ecosystem after the fire. This could be due to some plants being more resistant to fire, regrowth from fire-resistant seeds, or fire-induced vegetation changes that increase the availability of food for certain species. Consequently, the animals might be able to adapt to the post-fire environment more effectively, reducing the overall negative impact on their populations. Indirect effect: The increased food availability for animals could indirectly promote their survival, reproduction, and migration to other areas with more favorable conditions. This would help maintain local biodiversity and ensure the continuity of various animal populations in the ecosystem. In turn, these animals could play a crucial role in promoting the recovery of the forest after the fire, such as through seed dispersal and nutrient cycling. As a result, the perturbation would contribute to the forest's resilience and regeneration, minimizing the overall negative effect on animals in the long term."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a question about this article: In Renaissance Europe, from about 1400 onwards, there was a revival of Classical learning accompanied by the development of Renaissance Humanism which placed greater emphasis on the role of the individual in society than had been the case during the Medieval period. Buildings were ascribed to specific architects – Brunelleschi, Alberti, Michelangelo, Palladio – and the cult of the individual had begun. There was still no dividing line between artist, architect and engineer, or any of the related vocations, and the appellation was often one of regional preference. What is the answer to this question: What was the name for the time period?","output":"The time period mentioned in the article is the Renaissance. This era started in Europe around the 14th century (circa 1400) and continued to the 17th century. It was a time of significant cultural and intellectual rebirth following the Middle Ages, often referred to as the \\"dark ages\\". This era marked a considerable shift towards a more modern and progressive Europe.  Renaissance is a French term meaning 'rebirth', and it perfectly encapsulates the spirit of this epoch that resurrected the values, philosophy, and aesthetics of Classical Antiquity, especially those of Ancient Greece and Rome. Enlightenment, scientific revolution, the discovery of new continents, and the formation of new types of art, architecture, literature, and music are the defining features of this era.  During this period, the concept of individualism was borne, a significant departure from the collective focus that defined the Medieval period. It propagated the idea that each person has their own set of skills, talents, and purposes to fulfill in society. The Renaissance is famous for its great artists, architects, and engineers who were often multi-talented individuals combining their abilities in different disciplines.  Luminaries like Brunelleschi, Alberti, Michelangelo, and Palladio made significant contributions to architecture in this epoch. Before the Renaissance, buildings were not usually attributed to individual architects. The concept of individual artists and creators began during the Renaissance, which eventually led to the modern idea of celebrity and individual fame for contributions to art and culture. However, it is significant to note that, during the Renaissance, there was no definitive separation between an artist, engineer, architect and other related professions. The distinction between these occupations as we understand it today did not exist, leading many Renaissance figures to demonstrate expertise across a diverse range of fields. The 'appellation', or the title one was given, was often a matter of regional preference rather than a clear professional classification, demonstrating the fluidity and interdisciplinary nature of intellectual and artistic pursuits during the Renaissance."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on this \\"Manchester United have had an offer for Borussia Dortmund attacking midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan accepted.\\"","output":"Title: Manchester United Secures Borussia Dortmund Star, Henrikh Mkhitaryan Manchester United has successfully managed to bag in Borussia Dortmund's ace attacking midfielder, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, as the German club accepted the English side's lucrative offer.  Throughout the past few seasons, Manchester United has been notorious for rebuilding its squad and undergoing numerous changes. Amidst the club's various endeavors to restore its former glory, the signing of Armenian international Henrikh Mkhitaryan will undoubtedly prove to be a valuable addition to the roster. Known for his playmaking abilities, vision, creativity, and versatility on the pitch, Mkhitaryan will likely serve Manchester United significantly in their pursuit of silverware. Rumors had been circulating the football sphere about the Premier League outfit's interest in Mkhitaryan, but it wasn't until recently that Borussia Dortmund decided to accept their bid. This signing not only signifies Manchester United's assertion of seriousness in the transfer market but also asserts their intent to challenge for the title in the upcoming season. The 28-year-old attacking midfielder had enjoyed a sensational campaign with Dortmund last season, delivering 13 goals and 15 assists across all competitions. His consistent performances combined with his ability to unlock opposition defenses made him a hot property in this transfer window. However, it was Manchester United who ultimately succeeded in swooping him in after tabling a convincing offer that Borussia Dortmund could not refuse. Mkhitaryan's arrival at Old Trafford will be undeniably welcomed by the Red Devils' fan base, as the club seeks to bolster its attacking options in the lineup. Moreover, the Armenian's ability to play in various roles across the attacking midfield will provide manager José Mourinho with more tactical possibilities and flexible formations to employ. It is widely believed that Mkhitaryan's presence on the field will not only bolster Manchester United's playmaking prowess but will also serve to alleviate the pressure on Paul Pogba, another crucial player for the Red Devils. Manchester United's eagerness to pry Mkhitaryan away from Borussia Dortmund is a testament to their faith in his capability to be a game-changer. The Armenian international has a proven track record of success, considering his scintillating form with his former club. Moreover, his experience as a UEFA Champions League regular is an attribute that the English side hopes to capitalize upon in their quest to regain their European supremacy. The Mkhitaryan transfer saga's climax is a win-win situation for all parties involved. On one hand, Manchester United has secured an exceptional attacking talent who has the potential to help the club achieve its objectives. On the other hand, the German side has pocketed a significant sum of money for a player who might have been contemplating a departure from the Signal Iduna Park. Finally, the Armenian international has been granted a golden opportunity to showcase his skills and make an impact in one of Europe's most popular football leagues. As Manchester United awaits Henrikh Mkhitaryan's arrival, the signing's implications reverberate throughout the world of football. It is no secret that the club is craving a return to the top in both domestic and European competitions, and Mkhitaryan may very well be the catalyst that propels them in that direction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I was under full custody of my father living in a trailer in very rural Tennessee (Wayne County) with no electricity and a wood burning stove for heat.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the background: Start right above point on the temperature axis and follow the red line vertically. At very low pressure, the particles of the substance are far apart from one another and the substance is in the gas state. As the pressure is increased, the particles of the substance are forced closer and closer together. Eventually the particles are pushed so close together that attractive forces cause the substance to condense into the liquid state. Continually increasing the pressure on the liquid will eventually cause the substance to solidify. For the majority of substances, the solid state is denser than the liquid state and so putting a liquid under great pressure will cause it to turn into a solid. The line segment represents the process of sublimation, where the substance changes directly from a solid to a gas. At a sufficiently low pressure, the liquid phase does not exist. The point labeled is called the triple point . The triple point is the one condition of temperature and pressure where the solid, liquid, and vapor states of a substance can all coexist at equilibrium.  and the situation: John is learning about different states of matter. So far, he recognized three states of matter, state A, state B, and state C. State A is in solid state. State B is in liquid state, and state C is in gaseous state. He needs to learn more about their individual characteristics.

In this state, the particles of the substance are farther apart from one another as compared to state B which is the liquid state. In the gaseous state, the particles have more kinetic energy and move more freely, leading to greater distances between them. On the other hand, in the liquid state (state B), the particles are in closer proximity due to attractive forces, but they are still able to move and flow past one another. Therefore, the particles would be farther apart in state C (the gaseous state) as compared to state B (the liquid state)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"No, the answer provided does not accurately address the question of how former volcanoes affect hydrothermal activity. While it is true that large volcanic eruptions can influence temperatures in the troposphere and stratosphere, the question specifically focuses on the relationship between former volcanoes and hydrothermal activity. Hydrothermal activity refers to the movement and circulation of heated water, often caused by magma or residual heat from a volcanic system. While an active volcano can directly impact hydrothermal activity, former volcanoes (those that are extinct or no longer active) can still influence these processes in several ways: 1. Heat source: Even though a volcano is no longer active, it can contain residual heat from past volcanic activity. This trapped heat can still warm up the surrounding rocks and groundwater, leading to hydrothermal activity in the form of hot springs, fumaroles, and geysers. 2. Geothermal reservoirs: Volcanic activity can lead to the formation of underground geothermal reservoirs, which are areas of high heat trapped in porous rocks and groundwater. These reservoirs can exist for thousands of years, even after the volcano has become extinct, leading to ongoing hydrothermal activity in the surrounding area. 3. Groundwater circulation: The complex geological structures created by volcanic activity, such as faults, fissures, and fractured rocks, can provide pathways for groundwater circulation. As water moves through these pathways, it can interact with residual heat associated with the extinct volcano, creating hydrothermal activity. 4. Geothermal gradients: Extinct volcanoes can still influence the geothermal gradient – the rate at which temperature increases with depth. The residual heat from the magma chamber can warm the overlying rocks, resulting in a higher geothermal gradient than the surrounding area. This can affect hydrothermal activity by creating conditions favorable for the formation of hot springs, geysers, and other manifestations. 5. Mineral deposition: Hydrothermal activity often results in the deposition of various minerals as the heated water flows through rocks and cools down. These mineral deposits can form in the vicinity of extinct volcanoes, providing evidence of past hydrothermal activity associated with the volcanic system. In conclusion, while the initial answer provided information on the impact of large volcanic eruptions, it did not address the specific question of how former volcanoes affect hydrothermal activity. Former volcanoes can influence hydrothermal processes through residual heat, geological structures, and the formation of geothermal reservoirs, among other factors."},{"instruction":"Question: What genres are defined chiefly by lyrical focus?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The term \\"Viking metal\\" has sometimes been used as a nickname for the 1990s Norwegian black metal scene, which was \\"noisy, chaotic, and often augmented by sorrowful keyboard melodies\\". It has also been variously described as a subgenre of black metal, albeit one that abandoned black metal's Satanic imagery, \\"slow black metal\\" with influences from Nordic folk music, straddling black metal and folk metal almost equally, or running the gamut from \\"folk to black to death metal\\". Typically, Viking metal artists rely extensively on keyboards, which are often played at a \\"swift, galloping pace\\". These artists often add \\"local cultural flourishes\\" such as traditional instruments and ethnic melodies. It is similar to folk metal, and is sometimes categorized as such, but it uses folk instruments less extensively. For vocals, Viking metal incorporates both singing and the typical black metal screams and growls. Overall, Viking metal is hard to define since, apart from certain elements like anthem-like choruses, it is not based entirely on musical features and overlaps with other metal genres, with origins in black and death metal Some bands, such as Unleashed and Amon Amarth, play death metal, but incorporate Viking themes and thus are labeled as part of the genre. Generally, Viking metal is defined more by its thematic material and imagery than musical qualities. Rather than being a mock-up of medieval music, \\"it is in the band names, album titles, artwork of album covers and, especially, in the song lyrics that Viking themes are so evident.\\" Viking metal, and the closely related style pagan metal, is more of a term or \\"etiquette\\" than a musical style. Since they are defined chiefly by lyrical focus, any musical categorizations of these two styles is controversial. Thus, Viking metal is more of a cross-genre term than a descriptor of a certain sound. Ashby and Schofield write that \\"The term 'Viking metal' is one of many that falls within a complex web of genres and subgenres, the precise form of which is constantly...

Article: When you are traveling, it's vital to know about the customs and etiquette(,)of the global village. What we consider polite behavior at home isn't always accepted outside our borders. * Etiquette of Gift Giving Gift giving should be a happy, positive experience. When selecting a present for someone in Netherlands, don't purchase fancy kitchen knives or scissors. Giving sharp, pointy objects as gifts is considered unlucky. Be careful when presenting flowers to a friend or a business partner in Russia. Yellow blooms suggest cheat or a relationship break up. Traditionally, red carnations are placed on the tombs of the dead. Writing cards or notes while visiting South Korea, be mindful of your pen's ink color1. Writing a person's name in red ink traditionally suggests that the person has passed away--an important point to remember when giving a birthday card. * Eating Customs Being early or on time is viewed as being rude, too eager or even greedy in Venezuela. If you are invited to someone's home for a meal, it's recommended that you arrive 10 minutes later than the requested time. When having a meal in Egypt, don't use the salt shaker  . It's insulting to your host to spread salt on your food, which means that you find the meal terrible. Japan is a very polite nation, and their fondness for etiquette extends to the use of chopsticks. According to Japanese custom, if you're in the middle of eating, use the opposite end of your chopsticks to secure food from a shared plate. When doing business in Turkey, it's the custom for your host to pay for your meal. Requests to split the bill won't be accepted. If you would like to pay your fair share, Turks recommend inviting your host to a follow-up meal. Question: where is this passage probably from? Options: A: A news report. B: A culture column. C: A travel essay. D: A food magazine. Answer:","output":"This passage is most likely from a culture column (Option B). The article discusses various customs and etiquette practices in different countries, focusing on gift giving and eating customs. A culture column generally provides information and insights on the customs, manners, and social etiquette of various societies, which is consistent with the content of this passage. A news report (Option A) typically covers current events or latest information, while a travel essay (Option C) often shares personal experiences and observations from a traveler's perspective, and a food magazine (Option D) mainly focuses on recipes, cooking tips and techniques, and food-related topics.

If you are hungry, what do you do? Grab a piece of your favorite meal and stay quiet after that? Just like your stomach, even your mind is hungry.But it never lets you know, because you keep it busy thinking about your dream lover, favorite star and many such absurd things.So it silently began to pay attention to your needs and never let itself grow.When mind looses its freedom to grow, creativity gets a full stop. Hunger of the mind can be actually satisfied through extensive reading.Now why reading and not watching TV?

Pete Arnold, a right-wing blogger known for his anti-abortion posts on platforms like the DailyKos, spoke to CNN about the controversy surrounding the birthornot.com site. Arnold revealed that he and his wife had agreed that aborting their unborn child, nicknamed \\"Baby Wiggles,\\" wasn't an option for them. Instead, they hoped that the website would create conversation around the divisive subject of abortion. \\"This seemed like a pretty good way to further the discussion, because people don't ever seem to want to talk about it for real if there's no name on it,\\" Arnold explained.

We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by -1: -1 x 2 = -1 x (-s) This gives us: -2 = s Step 4: Verify the solution (Optional) To verify that the solution 's = -2' indeed satisfies the original equation, plug -2 for 's' in the original equation: 0 = -(-2) - 24 + 22 Simplify: 0 = 2 - 24 + 22 Combine like terms: 0 = -22 + 24 Add 24 to -22: 0 = 2 However, the correct solution is -2 = s. The verification process shows that the solution may have mathematical error which we can verify again as follows: 0 = -(-2) - 24 + 22 0 = 2 - 24 + 22 0 = -22 + 24 0 = 2 ≠ s As per the correct solution, s = -2 doesn't satisfy the original equation.

Shen Kuo (Chinese: Chen Gua ; 1031-1095), courtesy name Cunzhong (Cun Zhong ) and pseudonym Mengqi (now usually given as Mengxi) Weng (Meng Xi Weng ), was a Han Chinese polymathic scientist and statesman of the Song dynasty (960-1279). Excelling in many fields of study and statecraft, he was a mathematician, astronomer, meteorologist, geologist, zoologist, botanist, pharmacologist, agronomist, archaeologist, ethnographer, cartographer, encyclopedist, general, diplomat, hydraulic engineer, inventor, academy chancellor, finance minister, governmental state inspector, poet, and musician. Shen Kuo was born in Qiantang (modern-day Hangzhou) in the year 1031. His father Shen Zhou (Chen Zhou ; 978-1052) was a somewhat lower-class gentry figure serving in official posts on the provincial level; his mother was from a family of equal status in Suzhou, with her maiden name being Xu (Xu ). Shen Kuo received his initial childhood education from his mother, which was a common practice in China during this period. She was very educated herself, teaching Kuo and his brother Pi (Pi ) the military doctrines of her own elder brother Xu Tang (Xu Dong ; 975-1016). Since Shen was unable to boast of a prominent familial clan history like many of his elite peers born in the north, he was forced to rely on his wit and stern determination to achieve in his studies, subsequently passing the imperial examinations and enter the challenging and sophisticated life of an exam-drafted state bureaucrat.  From about 1040 AD, Shen's family moved around Sichuan province and finally to the international seaport at Xiamen, where Shen's father accepted minor provincial posts in each new location. Shen Zhou also served several years in the prestigious capital judiciary, the equivalent of a federal supreme court. Shen Kuo took notice of the various towns and rural features of China as his family traveled, while he became interested during his youth in the diverse topography of the land. He also observed the intriguing aspects of his father's engagement in administrative governance and the managerial problems involved; these experiences had a deep impact on him as he later became a government official. Since he often became ill as a child, Shen Kuo also developed a natural curiosity about medicine and pharmaceutics.  Shen Zhou died in the late winter of 1051 (or early 1052), when his son Shen Kuo was 21 years old. Shen Kuo grieved for his father, and following Confucian ethics, remained inactive in a state of mourning for three years until 1054 (or early 1055). As of 1054, Shen began serving in minor local governmental posts. However, his natural abilities to plan, organize, and design were proven early in life; one example is his design and supervision of the hydraulic drainage of an embankment system, which converted some one hundred thousand acres (400 km2) of swampland into prime farmland. Shen Kuo noted that the success of the silt fertilization method relied upon the effective operation of sluice gates of irrigation canals.

Movie plot title: The Pink Panther Movie plot: As a child, Princess Dala receives a gift from her father, the Shah of Lugash: the Pink Panther, the largest diamond in the world. This huge pink gem has an unusual flaw: looking deeply into the stone, one perceives a tiny discoloration resembling a leaping pink panther hence the name. As the camera moves in, this image comes to life and participates in the credits. When Dala is a young woman, rebels seize power in Lugash and then demand possession of the jewel, but the exiled princess refuses to hand it over.Dala (Claudia Cardinale) relaxes on holiday at an exclusive skiing resort in Cortina d'Ampezzo, where noted British playboy Sir Charles Lytton (David Niven), who leads a secret life as a jewel thief called \\"The Phantom\\", has his eyes on the Pink Panther. His American playboy nephew, George (Robert Wagner), follows his uncle to the resort hoping to steal the jewel and blame it on the Phantom, not realizing that the Phantom is his uncle.On the Phantom's trail is the klutzy French police inspector Jacques Clouseau (Peter Sellers) of the Sûreté, whose wife Simone (Capucine) is unknown to him the paramour of Charles and helper in the Phantom's crimes. Clouseau tries to stop the theft attempts, but he is so clueless and clumsy that when several attempts are made at a fancy-dress party, he looks everywhere but the right place.

What is the answer?","output":"A balaniferous tree is one that bears or produces acorns. Acorns are the nut-like seeds of trees in the Quercus genus, more commonly known as oak trees. Oaks are widespread and native in the Northern Hemisphere, and their acorns have served as a food source for numerous animal and human populations throughout history. Acorns consist of a hard outer shell called a cupule, which encloses a smooth-surfaced nut on the inside. The acorn takes about six to eighteen months to mature, depending on the species of oak tree. Once mature, the acorns fall from the tree and serve as a food source for various wildlife, including squirrels, deer, and birds. In addition to being an essential food supply for animals, acorns were commonly consumed by human populations, especially before the widespread cultivation of other food crops like grains and legumes. Acorns are nutritionally dense, containing various essential nutrients such as proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and several vitamins and minerals. Acorns are also rich in many other nutrients like dietary fiber, potassium, and polyphenols. However, they should not be eaten raw due to the presence of tannins, which can cause stomach upsets and interfere with the absorption of certain nutrients. To eat acorns, they must be processed by leaching to remove the tannins, after which they can be ground into a flour or used in a variety of dishes. In summary, a balaniferous tree is an oak tree that bears acorns, which have been a vital food source for both animals and humans for thousands of years. Acorns are dense in essential nutrients, but they must be properly processed before they can be consumed by humans safely. Oak trees play a crucial role in supporting diverse ecosystems by providing food, shelter, and habitat for numerous species."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A working knowledge of Photoshop tools will help you immensely with this method. See How To Use Adobe Photoshop Tools for general Photoshop tips.  Open the “File” menu and click “New” to view options for your new file. Type a name for your animation in the box next to “Name.” In the “width” and “height” boxes, note the measurement types after the value boxes. It's either set to inches or pixels, depending on what you've used in the past. If you feel comfortable specifying pixel size, change the measurement type to “Pixels.” If it's easier for you to visualize inches, choose that option. Type your desired measurement in its corresponding box. Choose a background color for your animation. Click the menu next to “Background” or “Background contents” (depending on your version of Photoshop) and choose from the color options. Click “OK” to create your new image with these settings. Each frame of your animation needs to be in its own layer, so you'll want the layers panel visible. Click the Window menu and check both Layers and Animations. The panels will then appear in your workspace. In the Layers panel, click the plus sign (+) to add a new layer. Next to “Name,” type a name for your layer, such as “Frame 1.” Set the Fill color either to Transparent or the color of your background. Click “OK” to create this new layer. Each element of your animation needs to be on a unique frame. Anything you put on this new layer will animate as one frame. If you want to draw on this layer, choose a color from the swatch panel (the panel with all of the colored squares) then click the paintbrush tool. If you want to add text, click the “T” to launch the text tool. Create another layer and build the second frame of your animation.  If the next frame of your animation will simply be a slight modification to the first frame, you may want to “Clone” your layer instead of creating a new one. To clone the layer, right-click on that layer in the Layers panel and select “Duplicate layer.” Continue creating or cloning layers until you have each individual frame of your animation on its own layer. In the Animation panel at the bottom of the screen, click the icon that is a small rectangle with a smaller square on top of it (the New Frame button). This will create one new frame. Click this button as many times as there are layers in your animation. If your animation will have 7 layers, create 7 frames. Click the first frame in the panel. As you can see from the thumbnail, this frame presently consists of every layer in your animation.  Notice that each layer in your Layers panel has a small eyeball symbol next to it. This symbol tells you that the layer is currently visible. To make the first frame in the Animation panel display only the first layer, remove the eyeball symbol from each of the other layers. Change the duration for this frame by adjusting the time (in seconds) beneath the thumbnail, which currently reads “0 sec.” Click each additional frame and remove visibility from all layers other than the one you want to be visible in the frame. Remember to adjust the time at the bottom of each thumbnail. The Play button is located beneath the animation frames at the bottom of the screen.

Answer this question: who helped the afghanis fight against the soviet union in their war of the 1980s??","output":"During the 1980s, Afghanistan witnessed a fierce conflict between the Soviet Union and the Afghan resistance fighters known as the Mujahideen. This long-lasting battle, also called the Soviet-Afghan War, lasted from December 1979 to February 1989. Apart from the indigenous Afghan resistance fighters, several countries and entities backed and supported the Afghan Mujahideen – notably, the United States, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, and China. 1. The United States: The US played a significant role in supporting the Afghan Mujahideen during the Soviet-Afghan War. As part of its foreign policy goals to counter Soviet expansion and influence, the US provided financial aid, military equipment, and intelligence support to the Afghan resistance fighters. The CIA launched Operation Cyclone, a program that funneled billions of dollars' worth of arms, ammunition, and equipment to the Afghan Mujahideen. These support efforts were mostly conducted through Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). Additionally, the US provided humanitarian aid to Afghan refugees who fled to Pakistan and Iran during the war. 2. Pakistan: Serving as the frontline state in the conflict, Pakistan played a central role in assisting the Afghan Mujahideen. With its close geographical proximity, Pakistan became both a safe haven for Afghan refugees and a base for Mujahideen fighters. The ISI was instrumental in distributing funds, arms, and military training to various Mujahideen factions. Pakistan's role was crucial to the success of the Afghan resistance, as it provided the necessary logistical support and extensive, cross-border supply routes. 3. Saudi Arabia: Riyadh played a key role in financing the Afghan resistance against the Soviet Union. The Saudi government matched US financial contributions on a dollar-for-dollar basis, significantly increasing the funds available to the Mujahideen. Moreover, Saudi intelligence agencies cooperated with the US and Pakistan in facilitating arms shipments, logistics, and other support. Saudi Arabia also encouraged Muslim volunteers from various countries to join the Afghan resistance in the name of Islamic solidarity and jihad. 4. The United Kingdom: The UK also participated in backing the Afghan Mujahideen, primarily through its intelligence services. The British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) and the SAS (Special Air Service) provided financial support, training, and equipment to the resistance fighters. British operatives aided in training the Mujahideen in areas such as guerrilla warfare, intelligence gathering, sabotage techniques, and communications. The cooperation between British and American intelligence agencies significantly bolstered the Mujahideen's efforts against Soviet forces. 5. China: Alongside the US, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia, China played a crucial yet discreet role in supporting the Afghan resistance. China provided military aid to the Mujahideen, including heavy weapons, ammunition, and logistics support. It was motivated by a desire to counter Soviet influence in the region and thus viewed the Soviet invasion as a threat to its own interests. In addition to these material contributions, China enabled a vital flow of arms and assistance through its territory to the Afghan Mujahideen. In summary, the Afghan resistance against the Soviet Union in the 1980s received significant support from various international allies. The United States, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, and China provided financial, military, and intelligence assistance to the Afghan Mujahideen, enabling a prolonged and ultimately successful resistance campaign. This multifaceted international effort was instrumental in the eventual withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan in 1989."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the official name of the act helped push through parliament by the man that who introduced Tom Nero?  In the first print Hogarth introduces Tom Nero, whose surname may have been inspired by the Roman Emperor of the same name or a contraction of \\"No hero\\". Conspicuous in the centre of the plate, he is shown being assisted by other boys to insert an arrow into a dog's rectum, a torture apparently inspired by a devil punishing a sinner in Jacques Callot's Temptation of St. Anthony. An initialled badge on the shoulder of his light-hued and ragged coat shows him to be a pupil of the charity school of the parish of St Giles. Hogarth used this notorious slum area as the background for many of his works including Gin Lane and Noon, part of the Four Times of the Day series. A more tender-hearted boy, perhaps the dog's owner, pleads with Nero to stop tormenting the frightened animal, even offering food in an attempt to appease him. This boy supposedly represents a young George III. His appearance is deliberately more pleasing than the scowling ugly ruffians that populate the rest of the picture, made clear in the text at the bottom of the scene: The other boys carry out equally barbaric acts: the two boys at the top of the steps are burning the eyes out of a bird with a hot needle heated by the link-boy's torch; the boys in the foreground are throwing at a cock (perhaps an allusion to a nationalistic enmity towards the French, and a suggestion that the action takes place on Shrove Tuesday, the traditional day for cock-shying); another boy ties a bone to a dog's tail—tempting, but out of reach; a pair of fighting cats are hung by their tails and taunted by a jeering group of boys; in the bottom left-hand corner a dog is set on a cat, with the latter's intestines spilling out onto the ground; and in the rear of the picture another cat tied to two bladders is thrown from a high window. In a foreshadowing of his ultimate fate, Tom Nero's name is written under the chalk drawing of a man hanging from the gallows; the meaning is made clear by the schoolboy artist pointing towards Tom.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What two brands of amplifiers do grunge guitarists use?, using the article: Grunge is generally characterized by a sludgy electric guitar sound with a \\"thick\\" middle register and rolled-off treble tone and a high level of distortion and fuzz, typically created with small 1970s-style stompbox pedals, with some guitarists chaining several fuzz pedals together and plugging them into a tube amplifier and speaker cabinet. Grunge guitarists use very loud Marshall guitar amplifiers  and some used powerful Mesa-Boogie amplifiers, including Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl (the latter in early, grunge-oriented Foo Fighters songs ). Grunge has been called the rock genre with the most \\"lugubrious sound\\"; the use of heavy distortion and loud amps has been compared to a massive \\"buildup of sonic fog\\". or even dismissed as \\"noise\\" by one critic. As with metal and punk, a key part of grunge's sound is very distorted power chords played on the electric guitar.Whereas metal guitarists' overdriven sound generally comes from a combination of overdriven amplifiers and distortion pedals, grunge guitarists typically got all of their \\"dirty\\" sound from overdrive and fuzz pedals, with the amp just used to make the sound louder. Grunge guitarists tended to use the Fender Twin Reverb and the Fender Champion 100 combo amps (Cobain used both of these amps). The use of pedals by grunge guitarists was a move away from the expensive, studio-grade rackmount effects units used in other rock genres. The positive way that grunge bands viewed stompbox pedals can be seen in Mudhoney's use of the name of two overdrive pedals, the Univox Super-Fuzz and the Big Muff, in the title of their \\"debut EP Superfuzz Bigmuff\\".  In the song Mudride, the band's guitars were said to have \\"growled malevolently\\" through its \\"Cro-magnon slog\\"., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The two brands of amplifiers that grunge guitarists often use, as indicated in your provided text, are Marshall and Mesa-Boogie. Both of these brands were specifically mentioned as being very popular within the grunge scene, with notable musicians like Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl using them.

The provided statement \\"A solid-state drive (SSD) (also known as a solid-state disk or electronic disk, though it contains no actual \\"disk\\" of any kind) is a data storage device using integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data persistently.\\" is a reasonable answer as it briefly describes the key components of SSDs and how they function. To elaborate on SSDs: 1. SSDs use integrated circuits (ICs) instead of magnetic platters or disks found in traditional hard drives (HDDs). This eliminates the need for any moving parts, which results in faster data access times and higher reliability. 2. Data is stored in NAND flash memory cells, which are grouped into pages and blocks. 3. SSDs use a controller to manage the data stored in the NAND flash memory and communicate with the host system (e.g., computer, server, etc.). This controller performs operations such as reading, writing, and erasing data. 4. SSDs can store data even when there is no power applied to them, making them non-volatile storage devices. This is due to the nature of NAND flash memory, which retains data even in the absence of an electric current. In summary, a solid-state drive works by utilizing NAND flash memory and integrated circuits to store data persistently and efficiently, offering faster performance and higher reliability compared to traditional hard drives with magnetic platters and moving parts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I can use this background: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.  Now, I have a new situation: Two identical planets, Norlon and Bothar, have been discovered in a neighboring galaxy of ours. These two planets have the same type of atmosphere as Earth and are extremely similar to Earth in terms of topography and even species of animals that live on them. The main difference is that Norlon is inhabited by a species very similar to humans that emit a lot of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Bothar, however, has no such species on its planet.  Answer this question please: Which new planet has a cooler atmosphere? The answer is:","output":"Bothar has a cooler atmosphere.  Since Bothar does not have a species similar to humans that emit a significant amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, it is likely to have a cooler atmosphere compared to Norlon. The reason for this is that carbon dioxide is one of the primary greenhouse gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect and global warming. On Norlon, the human-like species' activities would increase the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, causing more heat to be trapped and raising the planet's overall temperature. In contrast, Bothar, which lacks such a species, would have less anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions and thus a cooler atmosphere."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Dave Ki staged a dramatic return to the Rangers power battle on Friday in a move that places huge pressure on the current boardroom regime. The South Africa-based businessman purchased a near 15 per cent stake in the club by buying up shares held by fund managers Artemis and Miton. Former Ibrox director King is acting independently of the group comprising wealthy supporters Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor, who bought out Laxey Partners earlier this week to raise their total holding to 19 per cent. Dave King (centre) watches the Champions League clash between Liverpool and Real Madrid in October. However, the two parties share similar aims and could count on further support from various fan factions and other figures associated with the club who have a combined stake in excess of 10 per cent. Sportsmail believes that one of the parties may also have negotiated proxies from an institution to further increase an emerging power base that could force a New Year revolution. A call for an extraordinary general meeting aimed at removing current directors is now a real possibility. However, it was claimed on Friday that one shareholder has lodged a complaint with the takeover commission, believing King is working in concert with the Park consortium in a bid to seize control. Takeover panel rules dictate that if a consortium crosses the 29.9 per cent threshold it must make an offer to buy the rest of the company. King and the Park-Letham-Taylor group have 34 per cent between them but are adamant they are separate entities. King had previously spearheaded a £16million investment package that was rejected by the Rangers board in favour of a £2m loan from Newcastle owner Mike Ashley, subsequently raised to £3m. The Ibrox club is now facing a financial crisis, admitting on Friday that cash received from the £1m sale of Lewis Macleod to Brentford ‘will be used for immediate working capital’. Asked why he had moved, King told Sportsmail: ‘Because the board rejected my attempts to issue new shares to me and thereby get much-needed money into the club, which was my stated preference.’ Rangers captain Lee McCulloch applauds the club's travelling fans after their humiliating 4-0 defeat by Hibs. He stressed a willingness to work with any ‘like-minded’ group but stated he would ‘consult with other stakeholders before deciding’ future plans. King claimed his move was not influenced by the acquisition made by Park, Letham and Taylor but by ‘the availability of shares’. Of the decision to sell by Artemis and Miton, he added: ‘I believe they just lost faith in the present board and its ability to move the club forward.’ Subsequently asked whether an EGM was a likelihood in terms of bringing about boardroom change, King replied: ‘It may become necessary.’ Laxey Partners chairman Colin Kingsnorth said earlier this week that his firm had sold up to Park, Letham and Taylor to provide credible opposition to Ashley’s ambitions at Ibrox. The Sports Direct tycoon currently owns around nine per cent of Rangers and is limited to a 10-per- cent stake by a past agreement with the SFA. The governing body rejected a move for that to be increased to 29.9 per cent on Christmas Eve and Ashley’s next move is still awaited. He already has ally Derek Llambias in position as chief executive at Ibrox, while Sports Direct executive Barry Leach has been tipped to become finance director. However, asked how he viewed Ashley’s influence on the future of the club, King replied: ‘He has no real interest in the club — only in Sports Direct. I don’t view him as being significant going forward.’ King (third right), a former Rangers director, pictured at Ibrox with the league trophy in May 2010.

It read: ‘The company was informed on 2 January 2015 that New Oasis Investments Limited, a company 100% owned by the Family Trust of Dave King, acquired 11,869,505 ordinary shares in the company on 2 January 2015.’ ‘Following the transaction, New Oasis will be interested in 11,869,505 ordinary shares in the company, representing approximately 14.57 per cent of the issued share capital.’ Ashley has previously received backing from a 26-per-cent shareholding block for which Sandy Easdale holds voting rights. The Rangers football board chairman could now find his position under threat, as could brother James — a non-executive director — and PLC chairman David Somers. Sandy Easdale and King became locked in a war of words after the latter’s investment offer was turned down. But Easdale family adviser Jack Irvine said on Friday: ‘Sandy is pleased Dave King has shown goodwill and bought these shares and he hopes it leads to further investment in the club.’ A Stock Exchange statement from Rangers earlier yesterday formally confirmed the purchase by Park, Letham and Taylor. Highly-rated Scotland Under 21 midfielder Lewis Macleod (above) is leaving Rangers for Brentford. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"- South Africa-based businessman Dave Ki staged a dramatic return to the Rangers power battle, purchasing a near 15% stake in the club. - Rangers is currently facing a financial crisis. The club admitted that cash received from the £1m sale of Lewis Macleod to Brentford will be used for immediate working capital. - While there's no direct connection stated between Dave Ki and the group comprising wealthy supporter (Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor), they share similar aims and could count on support from various fan factions and other figures associated with the club. - A call for an extraordinary general meeting aimed at removing current directors is now a real possibility."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Eli and Daniel (David So) are two Korean American brothers who own their late father's struggling shoe store in a predominantly African American community of Paramount, California. They have a unique and unlikely friendship with an 11-year-old African American girl, Kamilla. These three deal with hardships on a daily basis; Eli and Daniel face racism from African Americans and Hispanics, and Kamilla has a troubled family after the death of her mother some years earlier, who warn her to stay away from the shoe store. Kamilla is also constantly badgered by Mr. Kim, who owns a liquor store near Eli and Daniel's shoe store; this leads to Eli often intervening on Kamilla's behalf, straining the relationship between Mr. Kim and Eli.

What is the common name of aluminium/aluminum oxide crystals used in grinding?","output":"The common name of aluminium/aluminum oxide crystals used in grinding is Corundum. Corundum is a naturally occurring mineral and the second hardest natural substance, ranking only behind diamond in terms of hardness. It has a Mohs hardness of 9, making it an extremely durable and abrasive material, ideal for various grinding and cutting applications. Corundum is a crystalline form of aluminum oxide (Al2O3) and belongs to the trigonal crystal system. In its pure state, it is colorless and transparent, but the presence of impurities such as iron, chromium, vanadium, and titanium can give it a range of colors, including blue, red, green, and yellow. There are a few well-known gem varieties of corundum, including ruby and sapphire. Ruby is the red variety of corundum, colored by traces of chromium, while sapphire refers to any other corundum gemstone that is not red and typically comes in shades of blue due to the presence of iron and titanium. In the industrial world, however, it is the abrasive properties of corundum that make it valuable. Corundum is widely used in grinding applications due to its extreme hardness, durability, and heat resistance. Its highly abrasive nature makes it suitable for grinding and polishing various materials such as metal, glass, ceramics, and even other abrasive materials. Some common uses of corundum in grinding applications include: 1. Grinding wheels: Corundum is used as an abrasive material in grinding wheels for various industrial applications. The wheels can be designed for different materials, such as metal, stone, ceramic, or even other abrasives. 2. Sandpaper: Corundum can be used as the abrasive material in sandpapers and other coated abrasive products for surface preparation, polishing, and finishing of hard surfaces. 3. Cutting tools: The hardness and abrasiveness of corundum can be utilized in the making of cutting tools such as saws, drills, and cutting discs for various materials. 4. Polishing compounds: Corundum can be used as a fine powder for polishing compounds and pastes that are used to achieve high-quality surface finishes on various materials such as metals, ceramics, and plastic. 5. Lapping and honing: Fine corundum particles can be used in lapping and honing processes to refine and create precise fits in components of mechanical devices, engines, and other equipment. 6. Abrasive blasting: Corundum is also employed in abrasive blasting applications as a high-performance, recyclable abrasive blasting medium for applications such as surface preparation, paint stripping, rust removal, and the cleaning of metal surfaces. In summary, corundum, or aluminum oxide crystals, are known for their remarkable hardness and abrasive properties, making them an ideal material for various grinding applications in various industries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence from a movie review: annoying score  Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","output":"Based on the sentence provided from the movie review, it appears that the movie was seen negatively. The term \\"annoying score\\" indicates a negative critique towards the film's music, which is a crucial part of a film's overall presentation and immersion. A film's score, or the background music and sounds that play throughout, plays a significant part in setting the tone, mood, and atmosphere of the scenes. It's instrumental in invoking emotions, enhancing storytelling, and accentuating the on-screen action, performances and dialogue. It can range from orchestral music to pop songs, electronic music to traditional folk tunes, depending upon the theme and essence of the film.  In some cases, the score also serves as a character in itself, providing audiences a sensorial feel of the unseen elements of the narrative, amplifying tension, fear, romance, excitement or melancholy as the plot requires. Movie scores also have a huge impact on the rhythm and pace of the narrative, sometimes signalling transitions, denoting passage of time or zoning in to focus on minute details. When a reviewer hence describes a score as \\"annoying,\\" it means the music may have been deemed too intrusive, out of sync, repetitive, lacking variation or originality, or simply not fitting with the tone or genre of the movie. It might have distracted from the overall viewing experience rather than adding any value to it, thus bringing down the overall impression of the movie. Therefore, given the important role of a film's score in contributing to the overall effect and impression, the phrase \\"annoying score\\" undoubtedly signifies a negative review of the movie. However, it's important to note that this is only one aspect of the film, and other elements might have been positively received. But, based on this sentence alone, the movie review is negative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Question: Which of these would result in reversal of desertification? Step 1: Understand the context of the question, which is desertification. Desertification refers to the process of land degradation due to various factors, including climate change and human activities, which results in the land becoming more arid and less capable of sustaining life. Step 2: Based on the fact, we know that trees play a vital role in preventing desertification as they help to retain soil moisture, provide shade, and support other plant and animal life. Thus, maintaining or increasing the number of trees is essential for reversing desertification. Step 3: Analyze the fact statement and its implications for reversing desertification. If a tree can be replaced by planting a new tree, it means that even if a tree dies or gets destroyed, we can plant a new one to take its place.

Here is a news article: Yaren, Nauru      I FORGIVE you if you have never heard of my country.      At just 8 square miles, about a third of the size of Manhattan, and located in the southern Pacific Ocean, Nauru appears as merely a pinpoint on most maps — if it is not missing entirely in a vast expanse of blue.      But make no mistake; we are a sovereign nation, with our own language, customs and history dating back 3,000 years. Nauru is worth a quick Internet search, I assure you, for not only will you discover a fascinating country that is often overlooked, you will find an indispensible cautionary tale about life in a place with hard ecological limits.      Phosphate mining, first by foreign companies and later our own, cleared the lush tropical rainforest that once covered our island’s interior, scarring the land and leaving only a thin strip of coastline for us to live on. The legacy of exploitation left us with few economic alternatives and one of the highest unemployment rates in the world, and led previous governments to make unwise investments that ultimately squandered our country’s savings.      Photo      I am not looking for sympathy, but rather warning you what can happen when a country runs out of options. The world is headed down a similar path with the relentless burning of coal and oil, which is altering the planet’s climate, melting ice caps, making oceans more acidic and edging us ever closer to a day when no one will be able to take clean water, fertile soil or abundant food for granted.      Climate change also threatens the very existence of many countries in the Pacific, where the sea level is projected to rise three feet or more by the end of the century. Already, Nauru’s coast, the only habitable area, is steadily eroding, and communities in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands have been forced to flee their homes to escape record tides. The low-lying nations of Tuvalu, Kiribati and the Marshall Islands may vanish entirely within our grandchildren’s lifetimes.      Similar climate stories are playing out on nearly every continent, where a steady onslaught of droughts, floods and heat waves, which are expected to become even more frequent and intense with climate change, have displaced millions of people and led to widespread food shortages.      The changes have already heightened competition over scarce resources, and could foreshadow life in a world where conflicts are increasingly driven by environmental catastrophes.      Yet the international community has not begun to prepare for the strain they will put on humanitarian organizations or their implications for political stability around the world.      In 2009, an initiative by the Pacific Small Island Developing States, of which I am chairman, prompted the United Nations General Assembly to recognize the link between climate change and security. But two years later, no concrete action has been taken.      So I was pleased to learn that the United Nations Security Council will take up the issue tomorrow in an open debate, in which I will have the opportunity to address the body and reiterate my organization’s proposals.      First, the Security Council should join the General Assembly in recognizing climate change as a threat to international peace and security. It is a threat as great as nuclear proliferation or global terrorism. Second, a special representative on climate and security should be appointed. Third, we must assess whether the United Nations system is itself capable of responding to a crisis of this magnitude.      The stakes are too high to implement these measures only after a disaster is already upon us. Negotiations to reduce emissions should remain the primary forum for reaching an international agreement. We are not asking for blue helmets to intervene; we are simply asking the international community to plan for the biggest environmental and humanitarian challenge of our time.      Nauru has begun an intensive program to restore the damage done by mining, and my administration has put environmental sustainability at the center of our policymaking. Making our island whole again will be a long and difficult process, but it is our home and we cannot leave it for another one.

Other major Tube stations Victoria and Waterloo closed five times and once respectively. Transport for London said it recognised Oxford Circus could get \\"very busy\\".

One Twitter user asked: \\"When will Transport for London sort out overcrowding at Oxford Circus? Closed almost every day at rush hour.\\" Following the terrorist attacks in Paris, another tweeted the overcrowding made \\"everyone jumpy\\". Minor closures were not included in the figures, released to BBC London through a Freedom of Information request. These include times when entrances were closed and stations only used for people to interchange and exit. TfL said these \\"partial closures\\" were \\"treated as 'business as usual' and usually only recorded locally, if at all\\". Oxford Circus is London Underground's busiest station, with nearly 100 million passengers entering or leaving the station in 2014. Stations are closed in order to \\"ensure that platforms are safe to use and there are not too many people on them,\\" a TfL spokeswoman added. Tailor Thomas Church, 25, from West Hampstead, who uses the station every day, said the closures affected surrounding businesses. He said: \\"When it closes I have to cancel appointments and that means I lose money. It can cost us thousands of pounds every time. \\"What I don't get is that London is the world's favourite city and Oxford Circus is at the heart of it - so why hasn't it been upgraded to cope with demand?\\" London Mayor Boris Johnson was forced to defend TfL in response to the figures. \\"Oxford Circus is in line, as you know, for a huge improvement and don't forget that is one of the reasons why Crossrail is so vital,\\" he told LBC. \\"That Central line, that whole network will be radically relieved by Crossrail when it comes in in a couple of years' time.\\" A spokesman for watchdog London TravelWatch said the figures showed the \\"need for continued investment in capacity in the face of ever increasing demand\\". A July report from the watchdog recommended improving how interchanges are shown on Tube and rail maps. It said this could include making it clear where stations are a short walk apart, the interchanges that do not require additional fares and those that require passengers to leave the station. General Secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union (RMT) Mick Cash said the underground network was \\"bursting at the seams\\". \\"RMT is now receiving regular reports from our reps of severe overcrowding on both the tube and the commuter rail services,\\" he said. \\"All the indicators are that passenger numbers will continue to surge, cramming more people into a capacity that is already at breaking point. \\"At the moment the transport authorities are winging it and that is a recipe for disaster. \\" \\"I think it needs to be pedestrian-only. There's just too many people. People are walking in the roads, I just walked in the road myself. It's a bit of a joke,\\" said Jonny Button. Isabel Cordwell, who works between Tottenham Court Road and Oxford Circus, said: \\"It stops me getting home in the evening. It's not at the same time every day so it's quite inconvenient. \\"But I'm not sure what can be done to change it - it's just the amount of people trying to get in and out.\\" Rebecca Koczan said: \\"It's pretty rubbish. Often I just walk to Green Park because I can't be bothered to wait. When you're coming home from work, you just want to get home and you can't because of what's happening.\\" \\"You can't get anywhere, can't get home quick enough and it's quite scary.

This sentiment stems from multiple negative experiences the reviewer had with the business in question. The reviewer's first point of dissatisfaction revolves around the quality of service received, describing their first massage as the 'worst massage of my life.' There's a clear note of disappointment and frustration, indicating a significant failure in the service provision. The reviewer's second key complaint refers to their experience with a second masseuse who allegedly was not paying full attention during the service, and was apparently engaged in inappropriate behavior. This experience would understandably lead to a sense of discomfort, imbuing the review with a negative tone. The third issue refers to the customer service component. The reviewer mentions a failure in being able to schedule further appointments despite having already paid for them through Groupon. This includes not receiving call backs or responses to emails and messages, which signals a disregard or neglect of customer needs and requests. Finally, the expiration of the Groupon without being able to use it for the services already paid for contributes to the overall negative sentiment. This aspect indicates a lack of resolution for the customer's problems, which further intensifies the negative feelings. The review concludes with a strong negative recommendation against patronizing the establishment, which significantly adds to the negative sentiment as it indicates the reviewer's overall dissatisfaction and their desire to discourage others from making the same mistake.

We have: 525*x + 1840 = 445*x First, we want to get all the x's on one side of the equation. So, let's subtract 445*x from both sides: 525*x - 445*x + 1840 = 445*x - 445*x This simplifies to: 80*x + 1840 = 0 Now, we want to get x all by itself. So let's subtract 1840 from both sides: 80*x + 1840 - 1840 = 0 - 1840 This simplifies to: 80*x = -1840 Now, we just need to divide by 80 to find the value of x: 80*x / 80 = -1840 / 80 This gives us: x = -23 So the answer is x = -23.

Given the question \\"What will happen to Cameron?\\", is \\"she will pay a bill\\" a valid answer? Answer:","output":"Yes, \\"she will pay a bill\\" is a valid answer to the question, \\"What will happen to Cameron?\\" when taking her pet to the veterinarian to get a new rabies shot. However, this answer can be expanded upon to provide more details and a better understanding of the situation. When Cameron takes her pet to the veterinarian for a rabies shot, several events or actions may take place, including the following: 1. Registration and check-in: Upon arriving at the veterinary clinic, Cameron will likely need to register her pet and provide necessary information, such as the pet's name, age, breed, medical history, and any current health issues or symptoms. If Cameron is a new client, she may need to fill out additional forms or provide proof of her pet's previous vaccinations. 2. Physical examination: Before administering the rabies shot, the veterinarian may conduct a physical examination to assess the overall health of Cameron's pet, checking for any signs of illness or distress. This may include listening to the pet's heartbeat, inspecting its coat, and examining its eyes, ears, mouth, and limbs. This serves to ensure that the pet can safely receive the vaccination. 3. Vaccination administration: Once the veterinarian determines that the pet is in good health, they will administer the rabies shot. This usually involves injecting the vaccine under the skin or into the muscle, depending on the specific vaccine being used. The veterinarian may also explain any possible side effects of the vaccine and provide aftercare instructions. 4. Record updates and future appointments: After administering the rabies vaccine, the veterinarian will update the pet's vaccination records. They may also provide Cameron with a vaccination certificate or documentation, which can be useful for pet licensing, travel, and other official requirements. Additionally, the veterinarian may discuss the recommended schedule for future vaccinations and appointments, in order to maintain the pet's overall health. 5. Payment and checkout: As mentioned in the original answer, Cameron will need to pay for the services rendered by the veterinarian. This will typically include the cost of the rabies vaccine, any additional tests or procedures conducted during the appointment, and possibly a consultation or examination fee. Most veterinary clinics will provide a detailed invoice that outlines all charges before requiring payment. In conclusion, while the response \\"she will pay a bill\\" is a valid answer indicating that Cameron will incur a financial cost for taking her pet to receive a rabies shot at the veterinarian, there are several other aspects of the appointment that can be elaborated upon to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sent 2: Durer rejected Alberti's concept of an objective beauty, proposing a relativist notion of beauty based on variety. Sent 3: Nonetheless, Durer still believed that truth was hidden within nature, and that there were rules which ordered beauty, even though he found it difficult to define the criteria for such a code. Sent 4: In 1512/13 his three criteria were function ('Nutz'), naive approval ('Wohlgefallen') and the happy medium ('Mittelmass').

Donald Trump is stress-testing how we think about American democracy Over at Foreign Affairs, Timothy Frye talks about how political science is having a devil of a time predicting Russia’s future trajectory. One theory of political science says that because Russia is a personalist autocracy, it is less likely to experience a successful regime transition to democracy (there’s a lot of other problems with personalist autocracies — click here for more). Another theory of political science says that Russia’s comparatively high per capita income and educational attainment makes it ripe for more democratization. In short, Russia is either on a dangerous path, or not. It is either primed for change from below or through a coup. Or neither. The consensus of experts suggests that change is unlikely. Predicting Russia’s future is particularly challenging because both theories have merit. The danger is to blindly follow one. Instead, observers need to keep an open mind about Russia’s political future. Or, to make it even shorter: ¯_(ツ)_/¯ It was impossible for me to read Frye’s analysis and not think about just how much political scientists don’t know about politics. For example, what is it exactly that makes American democracy tick? How has a 230-year old political compact managed to persist as well as it has? What in the Constitution has put a stop to permanent despotism or division? Many people and an awful lot of political scientists would answer with “rule of law” and “separation of powers” and “a republic, not a democracy.” Indeed, that’s pretty much the gist of James Madison’s answer in Federalist 10: It is in vain to say that enlightened statesmen will be able to adjust these clashing interests, and render them all subservient to the public good. Enlightened statesmen will not always be at the helm. Nor, in many cases, can such an adjustment be made at all without taking into view indirect and remote considerations, which will rarely prevail over the immediate interest which one party may find in disregarding the rights of another or the good of the whole. The inference to which we are brought is, that the causes of faction cannot be removed, and that relief is only to be sought in the means of controlling its effects. Madison goes on to argue that the Constitution’s checks and balances prevent the existence of factions from crippling the United States. And this is what I’ve always been taught — that the genius of the American Republic is that even majorities face constitutional limits on their ability to implement their will. While at the G-7 Summit in Japan, President Obama says world leaders are \\"rattled\\" by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. He also told reporters that Trump displays ignorance of world affairs. (AP) As political polarization has increased in the United States, however, a lot of commentators have raised a significant objection: what if this system can only function with the presence of strong norms as well as laws? This is a point that Jonathan Chait has made repeatedly, most recently this past February: It turns out that what has held together American government is less the elaborate rules hammered out by the guys in the wigs in 1789 than a series of social norms that have begun to disintegrate. Senate filibusters were supposed to be rare, until they became routine. They weren’t supposed to be applied to judicial nominations, then they were. The Senate majority would never dream of changing the rules to limit the filibuster; the minority party would never plan to withhold all support from the president even before he took office; it would never threaten to default on the debt to extort concessions from the president. And then all of this happened. Indeed, a disturbing fraction of Americans are growing skeptical about democracy itself. Can a constitutional democracy persist if the norms and beliefs that traditionally uphold it are eroding and eroding fast? Which brings me to the prospect of Donald Trump somehow becoming president. There’s been an emergent literature warning about the possibility of Trump inheriting the awesome powers of the executive branch that legislative gridlock has managed to engender. I’ve written on this problem as well. But as Brookings’ Benjamin Wittes notes, much of this is premised on the notion that the executive branch has poached too much extraordinary power, and that this enhanced power would turn a president Trump into a tyrant. That may or may not be true, but as Wittes writes, that’s not the biggest problem of a President Trump: Let me be blunt: The soft spot is not NSA and it’s not the drone program. The soft spot, the least tyrant-proof part of the government, is the U.S. Department of Justice and the larger law enforcement and regulatory apparatus of the United States government. The first reason you should fear a Donald Trump presidency is what he would do to the ordinary enforcement functions of the federal government, not the most extraordinary ones…. What would a president need to do to shift the Justice Department to the crimes or civil infractions committed—or suspected—by Trump critics and opponents? He would need to appoint and get confirmed by the Senate the right attorney general. That’s very doable. He’d want to keep his communications with that person limited. An unspoken understanding that the Justice Department’s new priorities include crimes by the right sort of people would be better than the sort of chortling communications Richard Nixon and John Mitchell used to have. Want to go after Jeff Bezos to retaliate for the Washington Post‘s coverage of the campaign? Develop a sudden trust-busting interest in retailers that are “too big”; half the country will be with you. Just make sure you state your non-neutral principles in neutral terms…. The presidency’s very virtues as an office—relative unity and vertical integration—make it impossible to render abuse-proof. It is vested with a truly awesome thing:“the executive power” of the entire federal government. There are simply too many ways to abuse that power to imagine we can denude the office of the ability to behave tyranically. There is, in fact, only one way to tyrant-proof the American presidency: Don’t elect tyrants to it. The political scientist in me wants to see a Donald Trump presidency, because it would be the greatest natural experiment in American politics about whether norms are as important as laws in constraining authoritarian impulses. The American in me is frightened about what the answer would be. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Donald Trump's potential presidency highlights the limitations of the American democratic system and its reliance on norms rather than just laws, which, as political polarization intensifies, has raised concerns about the erosion of the traditional beliefs that uphold constitutional democracy, threatening the balance of power and increasing the possibility of tyranny."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mandolin There are many styles of mandolin, but four are common, the Neapolitan or round-backed mandolin, the carved-top mandolin and the flat-backed mandolin. The round-back has a deep bottom, constructed of strips of wood, glued together into a bowl. The carved-top or arch-top mandolin has a much shallower, arched back, and an arched top—both carved out of wood. The flat-backed mandolin uses thin sheets of wood for the body, braced on the inside for strength in a similar manner to a guitar. Each style of instrument has its own sound quality and is associated with particular forms of music. Neapolitan mandolins feature prominently in European classical music and traditional music. Carved-top instruments are common in American folk music and bluegrass music. Flat-backed instruments are commonly used in Irish, British and Brazilian folk music. Some modern Brazilian instruments feature an extra fifth course tuned a fifth lower than the standard fourth course.

Sarah had a competitive edge over Angela in the race, because","output":"Sarah had been training rigorously for the past few months. Every morning, she would wake up at 5 AM sharp, put on her running gear, and head out for her daily run. She knew that this disciplined approach would yield results, and she was determined to prove herself in the upcoming race against Angela. She had also sought expert advice from a professional coach, who helped her fine-tune her running technique, focusing on maintaining a steady pace and conserving her energy for the final sprint. This guidance was invaluable in helping her reach her full potential as a runner, and she had been practicing these techniques consistently during her training sessions. Additionally, Sarah incorporated strength training and flexibility exercises into her workout routine, as she realized their importance in boosting her performance on the track. These exercises focused on building her leg strength, improving her balance, and increasing her range of motion, all critical factors in giving her a competitive edge in the race. On the other hand, Angela had adopted a more nonchalant approach to the race. While she was naturally athletic and had a strong base of running experience, she had not dedicated the same amount of time and effort to her training. Instead of setting a strict training schedule, she would run sporadically and often missed sessions when she felt tired or unmotivated. Angela did not consult a professional coach, relying solely on her instincts and her natural ability. As a result, she was not aware of the latest techniques or strategies that could help her optimize her performance, and she had not invested time in specific exercises to improve her running. As the race day approached, Sarah's preparation was evident. Her dedication to her training had led to significant improvement in both her stamina and her technique. She could feel the newfound strength in her legs and the fluidity in her stride. Meanwhile, Angela was growing increasingly anxious about the race. She knew that she had not prepared as thoroughly as her opponent, and she couldn't shake the feeling that her sporadic training would be her undoing. When the day of the race finally arrived, both Sarah and Angela arrived at the starting line with their eyes on the prize. The starting gun fired, and the two runners took off, each determined to claim victory. However, it soon became clear that Sarah's disciplined training had paid off. Her powerful strides carried her ahead of Angela, and her unwavering focus allowed her to maintain her pace without faltering. Angela fought valiantly, relying on her natural athleticism to keep up, but it was evident that she was struggling. As they reached the final stretch of the race, Sarah tapped into the energy reserves she had carefully cultivated during her months of disciplined training. She surged forward and crossed the finish line, her arms raised in triumph. Angela arrived shortly after, panting and disappointed. Sarah's competitive edge had proven to be the deciding factor. Her commitment, planning, and strategic execution of her training regimen had enabled her to overcome a talented but underprepared opponent. The race gave Sarah an important lesson on the power of discipline and determination, which she would carry with her into future challenges."},{"instruction":"Question: Read the article and select the best answer.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the lungs remove more oxygen happens, how will it affect more oxygen diffuses into cells from capillaries.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation has an effect on the process. If the lungs are able to remove more oxygen from the air, this increased oxygen availability would then affect the rest of the process. When more oxygen is available in the lungs, a higher concentration of oxygen will diffuse into the alveoli, which would subsequently lead to a higher concentration of oxygen in the bloodstream. As hemoglobin in red blood cells attaches to the oxygen, the level of oxygenated red blood cells increases as well. Since there are more oxygenated red blood cells traveling throughout the body, more oxygen would be available to diffuse into cells from capillaries. Consequently, this could increase the oxygen supply to cells, supporting their respiratory processes and overall cellular functions more effectively."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The local witch doctors have led a rebellion, and they reach the school before she is able to escape—the shaman wearing a body mask. Gwen screams, and the scene dissolves to the opening credits. The next scene is back home in England, where Gwen meets with the apparently Reverend Alan Bax for a job interview. We discover that Gwen suffered a nervous breakdown from whatever she experienced at the hand of the rebels when the school was attacked. Alan is impressed by Gwen and hires her to be the new head teacher at the small private school he and his sister, well-known journalist Stephanie Bax, run for the local children in the village of Heddaby. Upon moving into the teacher's cottage, Gwen asks her maid, Valerie Creek, where she might find the rectory. Valerie is confused—she knows there is no rectory—until Gwen explains she would like to thank Mr. Bax. \\"Oh, you mean the Baxes' house!\\" she says, and shows her the way after tea. At the house, Gwen meets Stephanie and mentions she tried to look for the church on the way but couldn't find it. Stephanie explains there isn't any church, and no \\"Reverend Alan Bax\\"—but that the pretence is completely harmless. Alan shows Gwen the old church, now a ruin, as he walks her home.

In order to absorb the iron, you must consume it through food or supplements. Vegetarians, young children, pregnant women, and individuals with certain chronic illnesses may be at increased risk for poor iron absorption or inadequate iron levels. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? people with chronic illnesses may be at risk for poor iron absorption","output":"Yes, the next sentence, \\"people with chronic illnesses may be at risk for poor iron absorption,\\" does follow and is supported by the preceding text. Moreover, it emphasizes that certain groups of people might face challenges in maintaining adequate iron levels in their bodies. However, you might want to provide more context and information on how to improve iron absorption rates for these individuals and others in general. To increase iron absorption, try the following tips: 1. Consume heme-iron-rich foods: Heme-iron sources, found in animal products like red meat, poultry, and fish, are more easily absorbed by the body than non-heme iron found in plant-based sources (like leafy greens, beans, and fortified cereals). 2. Combine heme and non-heme iron sources: Pairing non-heme iron sources, such as spinach, with heme-iron sources, like chicken, can result in improved iron absorption. 3. Eat foods high in Vitamin C: Vitamin C (found in citrus fruits, strawberries, kiwis, and bell peppers) enhances iron absorption, so consuming these foods alongside iron-rich ingredients will optimize the absorption process. 4. Avoid or reduce the consumption of iron inhibitors: Certain substances, like calcium and polyphenols (found in coffee, tea, and wine), can inhibit iron absorption. By not consuming these items during meals with iron-rich foods, you can improve absorption rates. 5. Utilize cast-iron cookware: Cooking food in cast-iron pots or pans can increase the iron content of the cooked food by naturally transferring some of the iron from the cookware to what is being prepared. 6. Consider iron supplements: For those having difficulty obtaining adequate iron through their diet, iron supplements can serve as an alternative source. Consult with a healthcare provider to discuss whether supplements are necessary and to identify the appropriate dosage. 7. Regular check-ups and blood tests: It is essential to have regular check-ups, especially for those at higher risk for poor iron absorption or inadequate iron levels. Monitoring iron levels in the bloodstream and adjusting dietary habits and supplementation as needed can help maintain optimal iron levels and ensure overall health. In summary, the next sentence does follow the provided text. To further support the statement, additional information and guidelines can be provided to educate individuals and promote better strategies for increasing iron absorption, especially in those most at risk."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After World War II, a German named Hans Müller is one of a shipload of Jewish refugees who disembark at Haifa in 1949. Like many other concentration camp survivors, Hans has psychological problems, including survivor guilt. At one point, he mistakes a woman and some children for his murdered family. At the first opportunity, he sneaks out of the refugee camp and goes into the city. When he spots a policeman, Hans panics and reacts by fleeing. The policeman chases him down and begins questioning him. Hans becomes very agitated and attacks, leaving the man unconscious in the street. Hans flees and ends up sleeping in the countryside, where he is found by a teenage orphan Sabra, Yehoshua \\"Josh\\" Bresler. Hans pretends to be an eccentric American, out to see Israel firsthand. Josh offers to be his guide. During their journey, Hans reveals that he was a professional juggler; Josh persuades him to pass on his knowledge. Meanwhile, police detective Karni sets out to track the fugitive down. On their journey, Josh is injured when he wanders into a minefield. He is taken to a hospital at a nearby kibbutz, but has only broken his leg. While Josh recovers, Hans becomes acquainted with one of the residents, Ya'el (Milly Vitale).

Input: Problem: a jar full of whisky contains 40 % alcohol . a part of this whisky is replaced by another containg 17 % alcohol and now the percentage of alcohol was found to be 26 % . what quantity of whisky is replaced ?  Options: a ) 1 / 3 , b ) 2 / 3 , c ) 2 / 5 , d ) 3 / 5 , e ) 4 / 5 Output:","output":"The question is basically a mixture problem, more specifically a problem related to alcohol content concentration in a whisky mixture. The initial percentage of alcohol in the whisky is 40%, and then a certain quantity of this whisky is replaced with another that has 17% alcohol content, resulting in a new mixture that has 26% alcohol content. We are asked to find what quantity of the original whisky was replaced. The theory used here is that the amount of alcohol in the jar before and after replacement remains the same (since we just replaced some whisky, not added or subtracted). So, we can set up an equation based on this understanding to solve for the unknown quantity of whisky that was replaced. Let's denote: - The quantity of whisky replaced as x (This is what we are trying to find out). - The total initial quantity of whisky as 1 (for simplicity) Therefore, the remaining quantity after replacement would be (1-x) Now, we can set up the equation by equating the quantity of alcohol before and after the replacement: (Quantity alcohol in original whisky - Quantity alcohol in removed whisky) = Quantity alcohol in the replaced whisky Whose expression becomes: 40% * 1 - 40% * x = 26% * (1 - x) + 17% * x Which simplifies to: 40% - 40% * x = 26% - 26% * x + 17% * x Solving for x gives: x = 2/5 So, the answer is c) 2/5.

Premise: He changed thumbs while he considered. Hypothesis: He changed thumbs while considering. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"In order to assess whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, it's important to first understand the meaning of each statement and the logical relationship between them. Let's break down the components of the premise and the hypothesis and compare their overall implications to determine if entailment is present. Premise: \\"He changed thumbs while he considered.\\" This premise suggests that a certain individual (referred to as \\"he\\") changed thumbs while also engaged in contemplation or thought. In this case, \\"changing thumbs\\" might refer to an action or gesture, such as switching the position of one's thumbs or fiddling with one's thumbs out of nervousness or concentration during the process of thinking. It may also be interpreted as the action of switching between thumbs while scrolling or clicking with one's phone. Hypothesis: \\"He changed thumbs while considering.\\" This hypothesis similarly posits that the same individual changed thumbs while in the state of considering or thinking. Here, the hypothesis also implies that the subject was engaged in some form of mental deliberation, and the action of changing thumbs occurred simultaneously or parallel to this thought process. Now, we can compare the logical implications of both the premise and the hypothesis to assess the presence of entailment. Entailment is a relationship where the truth of one statement strictly and necessarily implies the truth of another statement. If the premise entails the hypothesis, the premise must imply that the hypothesis is also true. Upon examining both statements, it becomes evident that they share a similar underlying message: the protagonist swapped thumbs in concert with a process of thought or consideration. In both scenarios, the act of \\"changing thumbs\\" coincides with engaging in mental deliberation. Given the close alignment in the intended meanings of both statements, it's plausible to suggest that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. The premise demonstrates that a certain individual changed thumbs and considered simultaneously, which directly implies the assertion the hypothesis is making. This strong and necessary connection between the two statements indicates a relationship of entailment. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"He changed thumbs while considering\\" is entailed by the premise \\"He changed thumbs while he considered,\\" as the meaning and implications of the premise contain the same elements of the hypothesis, and the truth of the premise directly leads to the truth of the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: In modern society there is a great deal of argument about competition. Some value it highly, believing that it is responsible  for social progress. Others say that competition is bad; that it sets one person against another; that it leads to unfriendly relationship between people. I have taught many children who held the belief that their self-worth depended on how well they performed at tennis and other skills. For them, playing well and winning are often life-and-death affairs . The development of many other human qualities is sadly forgotten. However, while some seem to be lost in the desire to succeed, others take an opposite attitude. In a culture which values only the winner and pays no attention to the common players, they are strongly against competition. Most of them are young people who have suffered under competitive pressures from their parents or society. Teaching these youngsters, I often observe  in them a desire to fail. They seem to find failure by not trying to win or achieve success. By not trying, they always have an excuse: \\" I may have lost, but it doesn't matter because I really didn't try.\\" What is not usually accepted by themselves is the belief that if they had really tried and lost, that would mean a lot. Such a loss would be a measure  of their worth. Clearly, this belief is the same as that of true competitors who try to prove themselves. Both are based on the mistaken belief that one's self-worth depends on how well one performs in the competition. Both are afraid of not being valued. We can discover a new meaning in competition only as this kind of fear begins to disappear. Question: What is the similar belief of the true competitors and those with a desire to fail?

Process:  - Gather the ingredients for the cake - Mix the flour, sugar, egg, and water to make batter - Pour the mixture into a cake pan - Place the cake in the oven to cook - Take the cake out when it is cooked through - Let the cake cool - Serve the cake -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less sugar is used happens, how will it affect a BIGGER cake.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"If less sugar is used in the recipe, it will indeed have an effect on a bigger cake, both in terms of taste and texture. The perturbation caused by using less sugar can have direct and indirect effects on the process of making and the final outcome of the cake. Direct effects: 1. Taste: Reducing the amount of sugar will lead to a less sweet cake. As sugar is one of the primary ingredients responsible for providing sweetness, using less sugar will result in a cake that may not be as palatable or meet the expectations of those who prefer a more traditional level of sweetness.     2. Texture: Sugar plays an essential role in the cake's texture. It helps make the cake tender by absorbing water, which later evaporates during baking. This process contributes to the formation of a desirable crumb structure in the finished product. Using less sugar can lead to a denser, drier, and possibly tougher cake, depending on the other ingredients and preparation methods used.     3. Browning and crust formation: When sugar is heated, it undergoes a process called caramelization, which leads to the browning and formation of a crust on the cake's surface. This process contributes to both the flavor and appearance of the cake. When less sugar is used, the cake may not brown as effectively or develop the desired crust. Indirect effects: 1. Recipe adjustments: To compensate for using less sugar, one might increase the amounts of other ingredients or add alternative sweeteners to help maintain both the desired taste and texture. This alteration can change the overall balance of ingredients and affect the final outcome of the cake.     2. Baking time and temperature: Since less sugar is being used, the baking time and temperature may need to be adjusted to account for the differences in texture and browning. This can lead to trial and error or the need to closely monitor the cake to ensure it is properly cooked. 3. Serving and presentation: A less sweet cake may require additional elements to enhance its flavor, such as serving it with fresh fruits, whipped cream or a sweet sauce. This can affect how the cake is presented, served, and enjoyed by those consuming it. In conclusion, using less sugar in a bigger cake can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of cake-making and its final outcome. The perturbation may require adjustments to the recipe, baking time, temperature, and serving suggestions to achieve a satisfactory result, particularly when considering taste and texture."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Earths magnetic field helps protect Earth and its organisms. It protects us from harmful particles given off by the sun. Most of the particles are attracted to the north and south magnetic poles. This is where Earths magnetic field is strongest. This is also where relatively few organisms live. Another benefit of Earths magnetic field is its use for navigation. People use compasses to detect Earths magnetic north pole. Knowing this helps them tell direction. Many animals have natural 'compasses' that work just as well.

Tropical forest: While some snake species do inhabit tropical forests, capturing a snake from its natural habitat can be dangerous and is often unethical, potentially harming the animal and disrupting the ecosystem. Additionally, capturing and keeping wild snakes is illegal in many jurisdictions. 2. Walmart: Walmart is a large retail chain that sells a wide variety of goods, including groceries, clothing, and household items, but they do not typically sell live animals, specifically snakes. 3. North America: This refers to a continent rather than a specific type of establishment or location where one would reasonably expect to be able to purchase a snake. 4.

This is a terrific movie, and at the same time ultimately poignant and sad. It's a story of a relatively wealthy and happy family from outward appearance during difficult times of Depression when the, Michael Sullivan, a father of two children, played by great Tom Hanks (I'm not his admirer but ought to say that) is a hit-man for local mafia boss, played by Paul Newman. His eldest son, a thirteen years boy Michael Sullivan Jr., perfectly played by young Tyler Hoechlin, after years of blissful ignorance finds out what is his father job and on what money their family live. Prompted by his curiosity and his aspiration to know truth he accidentally becomes a witness of a murder, committed by John Rooney, son of his father boss. Such discovery strikes an innocent soul and it caused numerous events that changed his life forever. The atmosphere of the period, all the backgrounds and decorations are perfectly created, editing and cinematography are almost flawless while the story is well written. But the main line of the movie, the most important moments and points of the movie and the key factor of the movie success are difficult father-son relations in bad times.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: There must be more to this story than just gas exchange with the environment. To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis.  and the situation: Matthew is training to run a marathon. Every day he runs up and down a hill near his house until he is out of breath, then walks around his house until his breathing rate returns to normal.  Answer the following question: Will breathing rate increase or decrease when the body requires more energy to preform a task such as running? Answer:","output":"Breathing rate will increase when the body requires more energy to perform a task such as running. This is because the body needs more oxygen to support the energy demand during the activity, which in turn facilitates cellular respiration to produce ATP molecules for energy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Not as a nurse, but as a patient. I had my appendix removed in about 1970 before keyhole surgery and the surgeon had not properly stitched the inside incision. This meant I was slowly “leaking” blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood. That was fine for the first five days, but the weekend came and she was off duty. Apparently, nobody else knew what to do. By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained. The nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she’d made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform. Despite the pain, I couldn’t keep myself from laughing loud and long. She then dressed the wound, directed some junior nurses to clean the ceiling and the wall while she went to clean herself. I apologized for laughing the following day when she returned. She told me she appreciated the humor of the situation so there was no “hard feelings.” Question: How long did it take the author to fully recover from the surgical mishap?

Options are:  + Yes;  + No; The answer is:","output":"No. The correct answer to the question of what allows an organism to create offspring both sexually and asexually is not \\"remains of prehistoric life\\". Remains of prehistoric life refers to fossils or preserved evidence of living organisms from earlier geological periods. This does not have a direct relation to the sexual or asexual reproduction methods of contemporary organisms. The question is most likely referring to the biological process known as the alternation of generations. This complex life cycle is found in some plants and algae. During this cycle, the organism alternates between a sexual phase (the gametophyte, producing gametes) and an asexual phase (the sporophyte, producing spores). Let's elaborate to make this clearer. During the gametophyte phase of the life cycle, the plant or algae reproduces sexually. Gametes (sperm and egg cells) are produced, which combine during fertilization to create a new organism with a full set of genetic information (a zygote), half provided by each parent. This zygote will grow into a mature sporophyte. Then, during the sporophyte phase, the plant or algae reproduces asexually. Special cells (spores) are produced through a process called meiosis, which halves the number of chromosomes. These spores can grow into new organisms (gametophytes) without the need for fertilization. Therefore, the process that allows for an organism to create offspring by both sexual and asexual means is the alternation of generations, not the remains of prehistoric life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:The company will also begin to offer Sunday parcel deliveries but this will be in the London area only. Allowing customers to collect parcels on a Sunday for the first time is the latest in a number of changes introduced by the company. Royal Mail, which was part-privatised last year, is facing competition from business rivals such Amazon. Royal Mail said its decision to open some delivery offices on Sundays would make it easier for people who shop online, but are not normally home during the day, to get their goods. The offices, which are located across the UK, will be open between 12:00 and 16:00 on Sundays. The company is also launching some Sunday delivery services, to addresses within the M25 area. Royal Mail spokesman Mike Newnham said it was about making things easier for customers. \\"In the last year or so we've launched our Delivery to Neighbour service, we've opened up about 600 of our delivery offices on a Wednesday evening to provide more convenience, and also we've launched the country's largest click-and-collect service in conjunction with the Post Office,\\" he said. Royal Mail's Delivery to Neighbour service involves items being delivered to a neighbouring address for collection if the intended recipient is not at home. Parcel deliveries account for more than half of Royal Mail's revenues but it is facing increasing competition from rival operators such as online retailer Amazon which began offering Sunday deliveries earlier this year. Analysts believe the growing popularity of so-called click-and-collect services, which allow goods to be ordered online before being picked up at local stores or collection points, is also having a significant effect on the parcels business. Last month, Royal Mail said it was bringing forward the final collection times at thousands of post boxes in order to save money. Royal Mail's network of about 1,400 delivery offices is currently open six days a week. Nick Landon, managing director of Royal Mail Parcels, said: \\"We are continuing to be more customer responsive and provide more options for people to receive items they have ordered online. \\"I am delighted to pilot Sunday afternoon opening at around 100 of our delivery offices across the UK with the highest parcel volumes, and Sunday deliveries to addresses within the M25 motorway.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"Royal Mail is introducing Sunday parcel deliveries in the London area and opening around 100 delivery offices across the UK on Sundays between 12:00 and 16:00.

The company is facing competition from rivals like Amazon, which began offering Sunday deliveries earlier this year. Parcel deliveries account for over half of Royal Mail's revenues, but the rise of click-and-collect services and other competitors are affecting the parcels business. Royal Mail's efforts to become more customer-responsive include the recent introduction of the Delivery to Neighbour service, extended opening hours on Wednesdays, and the largest click-and-collect service in partnership with the Post Office."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: Who is the son of the person that the hacker helps unplug everything from their house? is inside the article: A serial killer named Karl Hochman is known as \\"The Address Book Killer\\" due to his habit of stealing address books and choosing his victims from them. While he is working at a computer store, he obtains Terry Munroe's (Karen Allen) address book after another employee, who is demonstrating a scanner, copies a page of her address book into the computer. On a rainy night while heading home, Karl collides into a truck, which causes his car to go off the road and swerve down a trail in a cemetery as he laughs. In the emergency room he is put into an MRI machine. A surge from an electrical storm manages to transfer his soul into a computer. Now as a network-based entity, Karl continues to plot his killing spree using various objects connected to the electrical grid and computer networks. Karl opens the scanned page from Terry's address book and begins to kill all the names he finds there. Her co-worker, Frank Mallory, becomes the first victim when his microwave oven explodes. Another friend, Elliot Kastner, gets burned to death when a hand dryer turns into a flamethrower. Terry hires a babysitter, Carol Maibaum, to look after her son Josh. However, Carol becomes the third victim, electrocuted by an exploding dishwasher in the kitchen. The police do not believe the theory that Karl is on a killing spree after his death, but Josh realizes the order of the killings is related to a list of contacts from Terry's address book.

Answer the following question: U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday blasted former FBI director James Comey as an \\"untruthful slime ball,\\" and said it was his \\"great honor\\" to fire him.  Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week.  The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey.  The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles.  Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book.  Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump...
