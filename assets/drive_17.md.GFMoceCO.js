They find a small town with no people. That night, they see bombing on the horizon and realize that the ship that would pick them up has been destroyed. Then mysteriously, people reappear in the village: the villagers say they hid because the Germans had taken all the men, but having seen that the Italians are absolutely harmless they have decided to return to their lives. It isn't long before everyone's sunny nature appears.

Sergeant Lo Russo, the only member of the crew with a fierly spirit for war, takes up folk dancing, and the shyest of the soldiers, Farina, falls profoundly in love with the island's single, very overworked prostitute, named Vassilissa.

Article: Have you ever been in a situation, where you felt uneasy because of something you think you may have forgotten to do or perhaps a feeling that you annoyed someone whom you wanted to get along with really well. If you have experienced such feelings and worse on a regular basis, then you most probably are a victim of anxiety attacks. All of us, to some extent, have experienced anxiety at different levels. There are somethings you may know about anxiety, and some things that you may not be familiar with. So in order to be prepared for your unexpected feeling of anxiety, you need to get to know what anxiety is before it _ into a panic attack. Anxiety is simply the feeling of discomfort, uneasiness or fear of what may eventually happen resulting from an imagined, or a real threatening condition. On the extreme end panic attacks can occur due to heightened  feelings of anxiety. There are two main symptoms  during an anxiety / panic attack and these are physical and emotional symptoms. Physical symptoms include difficulty in breathing, shaking, direct feeling of heat, rapid heartbeat and tiredness while emotional symptoms deal with worrying, depression, fear, and lack of focus. In spite of the negative impression we have for anxiety, it is not dangerous in any way whatever. The feeling of anxiety is not bad, in fact it's more of a defensive feeling which protects us from possible danger by engaging a response within us in fight or fight situations. So it's not the \\"bad guy\\", you just have to learn how to control it. Panic attacks, however, are far more dangerous and should be a concern to your health. Panic can sometimes result in blurred   vision, difficulty in breathing due to a tight chest. The best way to different anxiety from any serious illness is to ask a medical expert for advice on a regular basis. Question: A victim of anxiety attacks may have the symptoms that   _  .

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Context: A major concern of using phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors in heart failure is their potential to increase mortality by inducing arrhythmias. By diminishing cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) hydrolysis, they promote protein kinase A (PKA) activity under β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) stimulation, hence enhancing Ca(2+) cycling and contraction. Yet, cAMP also activates CaMKII via PKA or the exchange protein Epac, but it remains unknown whether these pathways are involved in the pro-arrhythmic effect of PDE inhibitors.', 'Excitation-contraction coupling was investigated in isolated adult rat ventricular myocytes loaded with Fura-2 and paced at 1 Hz allowing coincident measurement of intracellular Ca(2+) and sarcomere shortening. The PDE4 inhibitor Ro 20-1724 (Ro) promoted the inotropic effects of the non-selective β-AR agonist isoprenaline (Iso) and also spontaneous diastolic Ca(2+) waves (SCWs). PDE4 inhibition potentiated RyR2 and PLB phosphorylation at specific PKA and CaMKII sites increasing sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) load and SR Ca(2+) leak measured in a 0Na(+)/0Ca(2+) solution ± tetracaine. PKA inhibition suppressed all the effects of Iso ± Ro, whereas CaMKII inhibition prevented SR Ca(2+) leak and diminished SCW incidence without affecting the inotropic effects of Ro. Inhibition of Epac2 but not Epac1 diminished the occurrence of SCWs. PDE3 inhibition with cilostamide induced an SR Ca(2+) leak, which was also blocked by CaMKII inhibition. Answer: Our results show that PDE inhibitors exert inotropic effects via PKA but lead to SCWs via both PKA and CaMKII activation partly via Epac2, suggesting the potential use of CaMKII inhibitors as adjuncts to PDE inhibition to limit their pro-arrhythmic effects. Student:","output":"Part #1: Construct a question on the basis of the information present in the passage. Usage: What pathways are involved in the pro-arrhythmic effect of PDE inhibitors? This question is based on the information provided in the passage, which aims to find out whether the cAMP pathways are involved in the pro-arrhythmic effect of PDE inhibitors. Part #2: The question must be unambiguous. Usage: How do PDE inhibitors exert inotropic effects and cause SCWs? This question is clear and specific, as it asks about the mechanisms through which PDE inhibitors affect both inotropic effects and SCWs. Part #3: The question should be answerable from the passage. Usage: What findings suggest the potential use of CaMKII inhibitors as adjuncts to PDE inhibition to limit pro-arrhythmic effects? This question can be answered from the passage, which states that PDE inhibitors lead to SCWs via both PKA and CaMKII activation partly via Epac2, suggesting the potential use of CaMKII inhibitors to limit the pro-arrhythmic effects. Part #4: The answer to the question should be unique. Usage: Which type of PDE inhibitor potentiated RyR2 and PLB phosphorylation in the study? The unique answer to this question is PDE4 inhibitor Ro 20-1724 as mentioned in the passage. Part #5: The answer should use text phrases from the passage.

The reason why option II is correct is that it provides a solution to hiding screw heads by drilling a hole in the wood and then covering it with either screw caps or dowels. This will effectively hide the screw heads and create a more aesthetically pleasing appearance. Option I is incorrect because it mentions covering the hole in the dirt, which doesn't make sense in this context.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What two things expanded the Kink's line-up?, using the article: In 1973, Ray Davies dived headlong into the theatrical style, beginning with the rock opera Preservation, a sprawling chronicle of social revolution, and a more ambitious outgrowth of the earlier Village Green Preservation Society ethos. In conjunction with the Preservation project, the Kinks' line-up was expanded to include a horn section and female backup singers, essentially reconfiguring the group as a theatrical troupe.Ray Davies' marital problems during this period began to affect the band adversely, particularly after his wife, Rasa, took their children and left him in June 1973. Davies became depressed; during a July gig at White City Stadium he told the audience he was \\"fucking sick of the whole thing\\", and was retiring. He subsequently collapsed after a drug overdose and was taken to hospital. With Ray Davies in a seemingly critical condition, plans were discussed for Dave to continue as frontman in a worst-case scenario. Ray recovered from his illness as well as his depression, but throughout the remainder of the Kinks' theatrical incarnation the band's output remained uneven, and their already fading popularity declined even more. John Dalton later commented that when Davies \\"decided to work again ... I don't think he was totally better, and he's been a different person ever since.\\"Preservation Act 1 (1973) and Preservation Act 2 (1974) received generally poor reviews. The story on the albums involved an anti-hero called Mr Flash, and his rival and enemy Mr Black (played by Dave Davies during live shows), an ultra-purist and corporatist. Preservation Act 2 was the first album recorded at Konk Studio; from this point forward, virtually every Kinks studio recording was produced by Ray Davies at Konk.  The band embarked on an ambitious US tour throughout late 1974, adapting the Preservation story for stage. Musicologist Eric Weisbard: \\"[Ray] Davies expanded the Kinks into a road troupe of perhaps a dozen costumed actors, singers and horn players. ... Smoother and tighter than on record, Preservation..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The expansion of the Kinks' line-up in conjunction with the Preservation project involved the addition of two key components: a horn section and female backup singers. These additions allowed the group to essentially reconfigure itself as a theatrical troupe, a significant transformation that was vital to the execution and performance of their more ambitious and theatrical rock opera Preservation. The horn section added a rich and dynamic layer to the Kinks' sound, providing powerful brass instrumentation that complemented their rock foundation while enhancing the overall theatricality of their performances. Having a horn section broadened the range of musical styles and arrangements the Kinks could explore, contributing to a more diverse and engaging sonic experience for their listeners. Similarly, the inclusion of female backup singers played a critical role in shaping the Kinks' new theatrical identity. The involvement of these vocalists added depth and harmony to the band's sound, while also allowing for greater narrative and storytelling possibilities in their performances. The additional voices contributed to the dramatization of the Preservation rock opera, bringing characters and emotions to life in a way that would not have been possible with only the core band members. In summary, the two elements that expanded the Kinks' line-up during the Preservation project were the incorporation of a horn section and female backup singers. These additions marked a significant shift in the group's identity and sound, providing them with the resources needed to create and perform their ambitious rock opera while enhancing the overall theatricality and diversity of their musical repertoire."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

His high-tempered partner and close friend Brian Gamble (Jeremy Renner) disobeys an order to hold their position and engages the bank robbers, accidentally wounding a hostage in the process.

Prices on vodka, wine, and beer were raised in order to make these drinks more expensive and a disincentive to consumers, and the introduction of rationing. Unlike most forms of rationing intended to conserve scarce goods, this was done to restrict sales with the overt goal of curtailing drunkenness. Gorbachev's plan also included billboards promoting sobriety, increased penalties for public drunkenness, and to censor drinking scenes from old movies. Although this program was not a direct copycat of Tsar Nicholas II's outright prohibition during World War I, Gorbachev faced the same adverse economic reaction as did the last Tsar. The disincentivization of alcohol consumption was a serious blow to the state budget according to Alexander Yakovlev, who noted annual collections of alcohol taxes decreased by 100 billion rubles. Alcohol production migrated to the black market, or through moonshining as some made \\"bathtub vodka\\" with homegrown potatoes. Poorer, less educated Russians resorted to drinking unhealthy substitutes such as nail polish, rubbing alcohol or men's cologne, which only served to be an additional burden on Russia's healthcare sector due to the subsequent poisoning cases. The purpose of these reforms, however, was to prop up the existing centrally planned economy, unlike later reforms, which tended toward market socialism.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The third alcoholic beverage listed in the context is beer.

Perugia, Italy (CNN) -- A defense lawyer for Amanda Knox made an impassioned plea to the jury Wednesday as the high-profile case neared its conclusion. Knox is the American student accused of killing her British roommate, Meredith Kercher, at the villa they shared in Italy.  \\"We suffer at the memory of Meredith. But we look at the future of Amanda,\\" Luciano Ghirga said in his defense summation.  \\"Meredith was my friend,\\" he quoted Knox as saying, rejecting the notion that she hated her roommate, who was fatally stabbed in November 2007.  Prosecutors say Kercher died during a twisted sex game in which Knox taunted Kercher, and two men -- Knox's then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 26, and acquaintance Rudy Guede -- sexually assaulted her.  The prosecution says a knife found in Sollecito's house had Knox's DNA on the handle and Kercher's on the blade, among other pieces of evidence.  But Ghirga rejected the accusations against Knox on Wednesday.  He attacked the way police and prosecutors had treated the defendant, giving them a symbolic \\"red card\\" -- a referee's sign in soccer that a player is being expelled from the game for breaking the rules.  Ghirga concluded an emotional oration -- sobbing as he came to the end -- by asking the judge and jury to acquit Knox, because her mother asked him to request it, because her family asked it.  Knox's father, Curt, said Wednesday she had been a victim of \\"character assassination,\\" and expressed hope she would be found not guilty.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"No, these two questions are not inquiring about the same information. They are addressing two entirely different topics. Let's break down each question to understand them better. 1. App to prepare for NEET Medical PG? This question is asking for suggestions on mobile applications that can help in preparing for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test Postgraduate (NEET PG). NEET PG is an entrance examination in India for students who want to pursue postgraduate medical education (MD/MS) after completing their MBBS degree from a recognized medical college. There are several apps available that can aid students in their preparation for the NEET PG examination. Some popular ones include: a) Marrow: This app offers subject-wise tests, QBank, high-yield videos, and daily tests designed to achieve better scores in the NEET PG. It also has features like performance analysis and personalization based on the student's preparation needs. b) PrepLadder: This app provides video lectures by expert medical faculty, high-quality study material, and a question bank with explanations and video discussions. It also offers an extensive test series to practice time management and gauge performance. c) DAMS: One of the leading medical coaching institutes in India, DAMS provides eMedicoz, an app designed primarily for medical students preparing for NEET PG. It offers test series, video lectures, Q&A discussions, high-yield notes, and other useful content. 2. Should I exchange my new Nikkor 18-55 mm f/3.5-5.6G VR lens with its VR II version? This question is related to photography equipment, specifically Nikon lenses. The user is asking whether they should exchange their current Nikon 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR lens for the newer Nikon 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR II lens. The Nikon 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR and VR II lenses are both entry-level zoom lenses designed for Nikon DX-format DSLR cameras. The main differences between the two lenses are as follows: a) Size and Weight: The VR II version is slightly more compact and lighter than the original VR version. This may be a factor if you value portability in your camera gear. b) Optics and Image Quality: While both lenses have similar optical formulas, the VR II lens has been reported to have marginally better image quality and a slightly improved VR (Vibration Reduction) system. However, the difference is not significant, and many users may not notice any substantial improvement in image quality. Considering these differences, exchanging the Nikkor 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR lens for its VR II version depends on personal preferences and requirements. If you find that the portability and marginal improvements in the VR II version are worthwhile, then an exchange may be a good idea. However, if you're happy with the performance of your current lens and do not see any pressing need for the upgrade, it might be better to stick with the original lens. In conclusion, these two questions inquire about entirely different topics - one is related to medical exam preparation applications, while the other is about photography equipment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","output":"Magma forms deep beneath the Earth's crust. Step-wise justification: 1. We need to consider the direction of the process given, which starts with magma cooling. This leads us naturally to the step right before that: the creation or formation of the magma.     2. Magma is an extremely hot liquid or semi-fluid material that is found beneath the earth's surface. Its formation primarily occurs in the mantle, the layer between the Earth's crust and its core, due to tectonic activity or certain geological processes. Therefore, it's legitimate to consider \\"Magma forms deep beneath the Earth's crust\\" as the missing first step. 3. After the formation of magma, the next step in the process is its cooling, which fits perfectly as the step after the proposed missing first step. 4. After cooling, the particles in the magma move closer together, forming crystals that contain various minerals. This shows how the process from the formation of magma to the creation of mineral-containing crystals is continuous and consistent with geological knowledge.

Answer the question about text: fallen fences and wild trees . we watch sunset and ate a few tree ripened mangoes . in 2 weeks there will be tonnes of bowen , nam dok mai , kp and elephant tusk mangoes just splotting on the ground below . Where may we be staying ?","output":"Based on the text provided, it appears that we may be staying in a rural or semi-rural area that has an abundance of mango trees, specifically the Bowen, Nam Dok Mai, KP, and Elephant Tusk varieties. These regions are typically found in tropical and subtropical climates where mango trees thrive. Considering the information, it is likely that we are in a country or area like India, Thailand, the Philippines, Australia or South America, given the popularity of these mango varieties in these regions. Here is a more detailed analysis: 1. Bowen (also known as Kensington Pride or KP) is a popular mango variety originally from Australia that has gained popularity in various parts of the world, including India and Southeast Asia. This suggests that we might be in Australia or a nearby tropical location. 2. Nam Dok Mai is a popular mango variety native to Thailand, recognized for its sweet and juicy flesh. This variety is popular across Southeast Asia, particularly in Thailand and the Philippines. Based on the presence of Nam Dok Mai mangoes, we might be in Thailand or its neighboring countries. 3. Elephant Tusk, also known as Mattu Gulla or Kilichundan in local languages, is a variety of Indian mango that has elongated shape and obtains its name due to its resemblance to an elephant's tusk. Based on the presence of this variety, we might be in India or its surrounding countries, where this unique mango variety is found. Taking all these factors into consideration, it's likely that we may be staying in a rural or semi-rural region in a tropical or subtropical climate. The area could be in or around India, Thailand, the Philippines, Australia, or a neighboring country where these specific mango varieties are commonly grown. It is worth mentioning that we are possibly in a less urban and more natural setting, as indicated by the description of 'fallen fences', 'wild trees', and enjoying the sunset, which suggests a more idyllic and less developed location."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. In the rest of the world, China's supreme sage, Kongfuzi (K'ung Fu-tzu), is better known by the romanized name \\"Confucius.\\" He was born in 551 b.c. in what is now Shandong Province in eastern China. So profound was his influence that eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to the birthplace of the Great Teacher. You, too, can pay your respects at the vast temple raised on the site of his home in the small town of Qufu (Chufu), and at his tomb in the woods just to the north. The classics of Confucius, while seldom addressing spiritual and metaphysical matters, set standards for social and political conduct that still underlie many of the Chinese ways of doing and perceiving. Confucius laid great stress on the proper and harmonious relationships between ruler and subject, parent and child, teacher and student, the individual and the state. These relationships were deemed to be hierarchical and dictatorial. If the order was disturbed, dire consequences inevitably resulted. The son who disobeyed the father would bring disaster upon himself and his family, just as the emperor who defied the \\"mandate of heaven\\" or ignored the good of the empire brought ruin upon the nation. Over the centuries Confucius has suffered more changes of fortune than probably any other philosopher. Honored soon after his death as the greatest of scholars, he was later revered as semi-divine; you can still visit temples to Confucius in many Chinese cities. During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), however, he was denounced as a counter-revolutionary force. It was only after the death of Chairman Mao (1976) and the opening of China to the outside world under more progressive reformers that Confucius, too, was \\"rehabilitated.\\" Unlike Confucius, about whose life many specific and even colorful details are known, the philosopher Laozi (Lao Tse or Lao-Tzu) is an enigma. Estimates of his date of birth vary by well over a century. One legend even says he taught the young Confucius. Laozi is immortalized by his book of thoughts on man, nature, and the universe, Daodejing (\\"The Way and Its Power\\"), which became the major text of China's greatest indigenous religion, Daoism (Taoism). With its emphasis on nature, intuition, the individual, paradox (\\"The knowledge which is not knowledge\\"), and the cosmic flow known as \\"The Way,\\" Daoism became the religion of artists and philosophers. After the death of Confucius, the Zhou Dynasty entered a period of strife known as the \\"Warring States\\" period (475–221 b.c.).  After reading the above, is \\"The Great Teacher\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Who's influence was so profound that eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to his birthplace?\\"?","output":"Yes, \\"The Great Teacher\\" refers to Confucius, whose influence was so profound that eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to his birthplace. Confucius, also known as Kongfuzi or K'ung Fu-tzu, was a highly influential philosopher and teacher in ancient China. He established the philosophical and moral framework that has significantly shaped Chinese culture and society throughout history. His teachings emphasized the importance of harmonious relationships, proper conduct, and hierarchical order in creating a stable and prosperous society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hazard's first-half finish gave Jose Mourinho's side three points and means that victory in forthcoming games at Arsenal and Leicester City will return the title to Stamford Bridge for the first time since 2010. Chelsea were pushed all the way by a resurgent United, hunting a seventh successive Premier League victory. Wayne Rooney and the recalled Radamel Falcao came closest for United but once again they fell victim to the resilience and defensive strength that is Chelsea's trademark under Mourinho, assisted by the brilliance of Hazard, and ended frustrated. The reaction of Chelsea's players as referee Mike Dean sounded the final whistle, celebrating wildly in front of their supporters, suggested they believed this was the victory that has pushed them to the brink of glory, as they moved 10 points ahead of second-placed Arsenal. And now, even if they do not wrap it up in these next two games, surely nothing can stop Mourinho winning the title in his second season after coming back to Stamford Bridge. As for United, this defeat may have ended their recent winning streak but they once again produced compelling evidence that they are now a very different proposition from the side that struggled, even though they were grinding out results, earlier this season. Manager Louis van Gaal, as expected, had to reshuffle his side after ruling out Michael Carrick, Phil Jones, Marcos Rojo and Daley Blind through injury. Ander Herrera was utilised in the anchor role vacated by Carrick and Rooney was pushed into midfield - but United were still able to make the more impressive start and should have taken an early lead. Media playback is not supported on this device Rooney looked a certain scorer when he raced on to Luke Shaw's cross but placed his finish inches wide, so close that goalkeeper David de Gea joined United's fans in celebrating a goal until they realised after several seconds that the effort was off target. Herrera was prominent as United looked the better side but, as ever, Chelsea were rock solid and resilient and took the first chance that came their way seven minutes before the break. Falcao, given a rare start, was easily bundled off the ball by John Terry and when Oscar played in Hazard with a clever backheel he applied a cool finish between De Gea's legs. Van Gaal protested furiously to fourth official Craig Pawson that Falcao had been fouled but to no avail. Chelsea almost doubled their lead early in the second half when Didier Drogba's shot was deflected over De Gea but Hazard could only turn the loose ball against the upright from an angle as he tried to complete the job at the far post. United's recent improvement was underlined as they continued to take the game to Chelsea, keeper Thibaut Courtois blocking Paddy McNair's 20-yard shot and Oscar deflecting Rooney's precise effort inches wide. Van Gaal introduced Angel Di Maria and Adnan Januzaj for Juan Mata and Ashley Young as they continued to carry the fight to Chelsea, who seemed content to protect their lead and hit on the break. Falcao had worked hard but it had been another fruitless game and his frustration continued with 12 minutes left when he escaped from Kurt Zouma to collect Shaw's pass only to strike the outside of the post from a tight angle. There was one last alarm for Chelsea when Herrera was cautioned for tumbling under Gary Cahill's challenge in the penalty area - and the scenes at the conclusion of an enthralling contest reflected the importance of this win.

Should I validate this answer? Choices: a). No; b). Yes; Answer:","output":"a). No; The suggested answer does not comprehensively explain how a fire extinguisher works. It only talks about the gases used in certain types of extinguishers. A complete explanation of how a fire extinguisher works should mention that fire extinguishers work on the principle of removing one or more of the three elements necessary to sustain a fire: heat, fuel, and oxygen. When you trigger the extinguisher, it releases a substance—generally either water, foam, dry chemical, or a gas like carbon dioxide—that's designed to put out the fire. In particular, the extinguishing substance either cools the burning material, starves the fire of fuel, or removes oxygen. The main parts of a fire extinguisher include the container, a handle/lever, a safety pin and seal, an extinguishing agent, and a pressure gauge. The extinguisher works when you pull the safety pin and squeeze the handle. The handle presses a rod which opens a valve allowing the extinguishing agent to escape through a nozzle or short hose at high speed. By pointing this at the fire, one can put the fire out."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

With the endorsements of black power brokers, black clergy and the Richmond Crusade for Voters, South Richmond residents made history, electing Reverend A. Carl Prince to the Richmond City Council. As the first African American Baptist Minister elected to the Richmond City Council, Prince's election paved the way for a political paradigm shift in politics that persist today. Following Prince's election, Reverend Gwendolyn Hedgepeth and the Reverend Leonidas Young, former Richmond Mayor were elected to public office. Prior to Prince's election black clergy made political endorsements and served as appointees to the Richmond School Board and other boards throughout the city. Today religion and politics continues to thrive in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The Honorable Dwight C.

A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you've provided - \\"less leaves fall on the ground\\" - doesn't have a direct or obvious indirect effect on the process of breathing or on the size of a person's windpipe. The process of breathing consists of the following steps: 1. Inhaling oxygen through the nose or mouth. 2. Oxygen travels down the windpipe (trachea) and enters the lungs. 3. Oxygen moves from the small air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs into the bloodstream. 4. Carbon dioxide in the blood moves into the alveoli to be expelled from the body. 5. Exhaling carbon dioxide through the nose or mouth into the environment. Leaves falling on the ground is an unrelated natural occurrence, primarily involving plants and trees shedding their leaves, typically during autumn or due to changing environmental conditions. It doesn't have a direct impact on the function or size of a person's windpipe, nor does it adversely affect the process of breathing.  Indirectly, there may be instances where an excessive accumulation of leaves could affect air quality, such as a large pile of rotting leaves producing mold and emitting unpleasant odors. In this case, the air quality might influence a person's breathing experience or potentially exacerbate pre-existing respiratory conditions, but it still wouldn't directly impact the area of the windpipe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information:  - The IBM Personal Computer, commonly known as the IBM PC, is the original version and progenitor of the IBM PC compatible hardware platform. It is IBM model number 5150, and was introduced on August 12, 1981. It was created by a team of engineers and designers under the direction of Don Estridge of the IBM Entry Systems Division in Boca Raton, Florida.  - IBM PC compatible computers are those similar to the original IBM PC, XT, and AT, able to run the same software and support the same expansion cards as those. Such computers used to be referred to as PC clones, or IBM clones. They duplicate almost exactly all the significant features of the PC architecture, facilitated by IBM's choice of commodity hardware components and various manufacturers' ability to reverse engineer the BIOS firmware using a \\"clean room design\\" technique. Columbia Data Products built the first clone of the IBM personal computer by a clean room implementation of its BIOS.  - The expansion card (also expansion board, adapter card or accessory card) in computing is a printed circuit board that can be inserted into an electrical connector, or expansion slot on a computer motherboard, backplane or riser card to add functionality to a computer system via the expansion bus.  - Columbia Data Products (CDP) is a company that produced some of the first IBM PC clones. It faltered in that market after only a few years, and later reinvented itself as a software development company.  - Clean room design (also known as the Chinese wall technique) is the method of copying a design by reverse engineering and then recreating it without infringing any of the copyrights associated with the original design. Clean room design is useful as a defense against copyright infringement because it relies on independent invention. However, because independent invention is not a defense against patents, clean room designs typically cannot be used to circumvent patent restrictions.  - The dot-com bubble (also known as the dot-com boom, the tech bubble, the Internet bubble, the dot-com collapse, and the information technology bubble) was a historic speculative bubble covering roughly 19952001 during which stock markets in industrialized nations saw their equity value rise rapidly from growth in the Internet sector and related fields. While the latter part was a boom and bust cycle, the Internet boom is sometimes meant to refer to the steady commercial growth of the Internet with the advent of the World Wide Web, as exemplified by the first release of the Mosaic web browser in 1993, and continuing through the 1990s.  - The BIOS (an acronym for Basic Input/Output System and also known as the System BIOS, ROM BIOS or PC BIOS) is a type of firmware used to perform hardware initialization during the booting process (power-on startup) on IBM PC compatible computers, and to provide runtime services for operating systems and programs. The BIOS firmware is built into personal computers (PCs), and it is the first software they run when powered on. The name itself originates from the Basic Input/Output System used in the CP/M operating system in 1975. Originally proprietary to the IBM PC, the BIOS has been reverse engineered by companies looking to create compatible systems and the interface of that original system serves as a \\"de facto\\" standard.  - A personal computer (PC) is a multi-purpose electronic computer whose size, capabilities, and price make it feasible for individual use. PCs are intended to be operated directly by a person using a graphical user interface such as Windows. The versatility of a personal computer is greatly enhanced by the use of peripheral devices such as a keyboard, monitor, printer, mouse, speakers, and an external hard drive.  - The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet. English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser computer program in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland.  - The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing.  - Compaq Computer Corporation was a company founded in 1982 that developed , sold , and supported computers and related products and services . Compaq produced some of the first IBM PC compatible computers , being the first company to legally reverse engineer the IBM Personal Computer . It rose to become the largest supplier of PC systems during the 1990s before being overtaken by HP in 2001 . Struggling in the aftermath of the dot - com bubble bust , Compaq was acquired for US  25 billion by HP in 2002 . The Compaq brand remained in use by HP for lower - end systems until 2013 when , without warning , the Compaq name was quietly discontinued . The company was formed by Rod Canion , Jim Harris and Bill Murto -- former Texas Instruments senior managers . Murto ( SVP of Sales ) departed Compaq in 1987 , while Canion ( President and CEO ) and Harris ( SVP of Engineering ) left under a shakeup in 1991 , which saw Eckhard Pfeiffer appointed President and CEO .

ADVERTISEMENT      Multiple protesters interrupted House floor debate on the tax bill Tuesday, including people who shouted \\"kill the bill, don't kill us!\\" as well as a woman in a wheelchair who said she relies on Medicaid and warned that the bill would \\"starve\\" the public.      One protester even interrupted Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanOvernight Finance: Supreme Court strikes down law banning sports betting | Lawmakers stunned by Trump push to help Chinese company | Ryan, GOP scramble to win support for controversial farm bill The Hill's 12:30 Report CBO: Rescissions would only save B in spending MORE (R-Wis.) as he delivered a floor speech that he's wanted to give for decades in support of the tax overhaul.      \\"Today, we are giving the people of this country their money back. This is their money, after all,\\" Ryan said.      A woman in the public visitors gallery then shouted, \\"You're lying!\\"      Tax reform has long been a top priority for Ryan and other congressional Republicans, who view it as necessary to improve business competitiveness and boost economic growth. Trump also promised large tax cuts on the campaign trail and in his first months in office.      Republicans view the tax overhaul as critical to maintaining their congressional majorities in 2018, after they failed this year to fulfill their seven-year pledge to repeal ObamaCare.      The first overhaul of the tax code since 1986 sped through Congress at a rapid pace, from House Republicans first unveiling a bill in early November to passing a final bicameral compromise a month later.      By contrast, the 1986 tax-reform effort had bipartisan support and didn’t reach then-President Reagan’s desk until nearly a year after it was first introduced in the House.      Public polling on the GOP’s tax overhaul indicates support hovering at less than 30 percent, which is even lower than the favorability toward ObamaCare when Democrats passed it in 2010. Republicans have battled the perception their plan primarily benefits corporations and the wealthy, even though many middle-class taxpayers will get at least a modest tax cut.      But GOP lawmakers insist people will come to appreciate the changes made by the tax overhaul over time.      “When they get another 100 to 150 a month, by February when the new brackets come out, they’re going to say, ‘Honey! [Senate Minority Leader Charles] Schumer [D-N.Y.] was lying to me! [House Minority Leader Nancy] Pelosi [D-Calif.] was lying!

I got more money!’ ” said Rep. Chris Collins Christopher (Chris) Carl CollinsGOP lawmakers back discharge petition to force immigration votes GOP in retreat on ObamaCare Obstacles for Trump in push to expand the death penalty MORE (R-N.Y.).      The final tax bill involved lawmakers making some concessions from their original wish lists, but achieves the goals of cutting taxes across the board and making the U.S. corporate tax system more in line with the systems in other countries.      The bill lowers the top individual rate from 39.6 percent to 37 percent, slashes the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and creates a 20-percent deduction for income of pass-through businesses that pay taxes through the individual code.      It increases the exemption amounts for the individual alternative minimum tax and estate tax, and it moves the U.S. to a territorial tax system that generally exempts U.S. companies’ foreign earnings from U.S. taxes.      Additionally, the bill effectively repeals ObamaCare’s individual mandate that requires people to buy health insurance or face a tax penalty, and it allows for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge — two top priorities for many Republicans.      In order to comply with budget rules that allow the Senate to pass the bill with a simple-majority vote, most of the tax cuts for individuals expire after eight years while the corporate tax cuts are permanent.      The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that income groups across the board would on average get a tax cut in 2019. But in 2027, after the individual cuts are set to expire, income groups under 75,000 would on average see their taxes go up. Republicans say they expect the temporary tax cuts will be extended.      The committee also estimated the bill would add 1.46 trillion to the debt over 10 years.      The House Republicans who voted against the bill were mostly lawmakers from New York, New Jersey and California who were troubled by the bill’s 10,000 cap on the state and local tax deduction.

(Associated Press)      WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on the push in Congress to pass a sweeping tax cut bill (all times local):      4:50 p.m.      Democrats say three provisions in the Republican 1.5 trillion tax bill violate Senate rules and will likely be removed before that chamber votes on the measure.      The House approved the legislation Tuesday. But this means the House will have to vote again on the legislation once it's been amended and approved by the Senate.      Senate passage was expected Tuesday night or early Wednesday. GOP House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy's office says the House would reconsider the bill Wednesday morning and send it to President Donald Trump for his signature.      Democrats said the Senate parliamentarian had found three items that violated Senate rules.      These included one provision that would let families use tax-advantaged 529 accounts for home-schooling expenses.      The problem was revealed by Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders and Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden.      ___      3:50 p.m.      House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (skuh-LEES') says the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee should retain his position even though he voted against the GOP tax overhaul, the most important vote of the year to Republican leaders.      Scalise says New Jersey Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen (FREE'-ling-hy-zehn) long ago informed GOP leaders that he opposed the bill because of its impact on high-tax states such as New Jersey. Frelinghuysen voted against the bill Tuesday, leading some House conservatives to say he should be replaced as Appropriations chair.      Scalise called that an overreaction, saying Frelinghuysen is \\"doing a really good job in a tough position\\" on Appropriations.

Movie title: 4.3.2.1 Movie plot: The story focuses on four 19-year-old friends: Joanne, Cassandra, Shannon and Kerrys. They all meet one other at a diner, where they see Dillon and Smoothy. Unbeknownst to Dillon, Shannon has a crush on him. As the police turn up, Dillon and Smoothy run off and Dillon accidentally drops a stolen diamond into Cassandra's bag. The four girls then walk out and go their separate ways home. First, the story focuses on Shannon: she walks into her home just as her mother is leaving her father. She loses her temper and runs away, going to Jo's home, who has to rush to work, telling her she does not have time to talk. Jo calls Shannon over to the supermarket where she works, but tells her to leave as soon as she arrives. When she refuses, Dillon kisses Jo, upsetting Shannon, whom he asked out earlier in the day, so she grabs a Pringles tube from the shop and runs away. After getting drunk at a bar, she goes to a tunnel where she sprays graffiti on the wall, is attacked by a gang and then taken in by Kelly, who saved her. Shannon realizes that Kelly seems to be looking for the Pringles. This is later confirmed when she finds out that she is searching for \\"15 diamonds\\".

She finds the diamonds by going back to where she was attacked, and leaves a message informing Jo about them. Later, Shannon tracks down her mother and accuses her of not caring about her, especially when she forced her to get an abortion. Her story ends with her holding the diamonds above a bridge, suggesting she is about to commit suicide. Jo, Cassandra and Kerrys appear to threaten Shannon into handing the diamonds over.

Summarize this article: The Scottish Conservative leader, who is gay, plans to marry her partner in the near future. The DUP opposes same-sex marriage, with Northern Ireland the only part of the UK where it is not legal. Ms Davidson said she had been given an assurance that gay rights would not be eroded in return for DUP support. In a tweet sent on Friday afternoon, Ms Davidson highlighted a speech she made in Belfast about the importance of equal marriage. She told the BBC's Reporting Scotland programme that she had spoken about the issue with Theresa May on Friday evening. Ms Davidson said: \\"I was fairly straightforward with her and I told her that there were a number of things that count to me more than party. \\"One of them is country, one of the others is LGBTI rights.\\" The Scottish Tory leader said she had asked for, and received, a \\"categoric assurance\\" from Mrs May that any arrangement between the Conservatives and the DUP would see \\"absolutely no rescission of LGBTI rights in the rest of the UK\\". And she said the prime minister agreed to try to use her influence to advance LGBTI rights in Northern Ireland. Ms May, whose party lost its majority at Westminster in Thursday's general election, says she will put together a minority government with the support of the DUP to guide the UK through crucial Brexit talks. The DUP, which returned 10 MPs to Westminster, has garnered a reputation for its strong and controversial views on a number of social issues. It opposes same-sex marriage and is anti-abortion - with abortion remaining illegal in Northern Ireland, except in specific medical cases. In a short statement outside Downing Street after an audience with the Queen, Mrs May said she would join with her DUP \\"friends\\" to \\"get to work\\" on Brexit. She referred to the \\"strong relationship\\" she had with the DUP, but gave little detail of how their arrangement might work. It is thought Mrs May will seek some kind of informal arrangement with the DUP that could see it \\"lend\\" its support to the Tories on a vote-by-vote basis, known as \\"confidence and supply\\". When asked whether she was comfortable about the arrangement given the DUP's views, Ms Davidson said there was \\"no suggestion\\" that the Conservative government would be dependent on the support of the DUP. She added: \\"The prime minister has already made it clear that it is not going to be a formal coalition, so let's see how the future days go ahead.\\" Ms Davidson, who backed Remain in the EU referendum, has called for the Tories to listen to other parties to deliver an \\"open Brexit\\", which she defines as ensuring that free trade is at the heart of the Brexit negotiations. She said: \\"I want to make sure that Scottish businesses can trade as freely as possible with the other 27 countries in the EU as well as the other countries around the world.\\" Ms Davidson's party won 13 seats in Scotland as its vote surged across the country. Scottish Labour and the Liberal Democrats returned seven and four MPs respectively, with the SNP winning 35 - a drop of 21 from the 56 the party won two years ago. The DUP are pro-union (not Europe but UK), pro-Brexit and socially conservative. The party, which returned 10 MPs to Westminster, has garnered a reputation for its strong, sometimes controversial views. It opposes same-sex marriage and is anti-abortion - abortion remains illegal in Northern Ireland, except in specific medical cases. One MP is a devout climate change denier, while a former MP once called for creationism - the belief that human life did not evolve over millions of years but was created by God - to be taught alongside evolution in science classes. During the election campaign, the DUP's Emma Little-Pengelly was endorsed by the three biggest loyalist paramilitary organisations.

Context: In time, the network spread beyond academic and military institutions and became known as the Internet. The emergence of networking involved a redefinition of the nature and boundaries of the computer. Computer operating systems and applications were modified to include the ability to define and access the resources of other computers on the network, such as peripheral devices, stored information, and the like, as extensions of the resources of an individual computer. Initially these facilities were available primarily to people working in high-tech environments, but in the 1990s the spread of applications like e-mail and the World Wide Web, combined with the development of cheap, fast networking technologies like Ethernet and ADSL saw computer networking become almost ubiquitous. In fact, the number of computers that are networked is growing phenomenally. A very large proportion of personal computers regularly connect to the Internet to communicate and receive information. \\"Wireless\\" networking, often utilizing mobile phone networks, has meant networking is becoming increasingly ubiquitous even in mobile computing environments.

Please answer the following question: Riding a bike does not cause pollution, and bikes are good for exercise and produce no pollution. Given these facts, what can you ride to get good exercise and avoid producing harmful gases among the following options: - cows  - bike  - stairmaster  - cycles  - bus  - trolley  - Lift  - goats Answer:","output":"Out of the options provided, riding a bike and using cycles are the most suitable means of getting good exercise while avoiding the production of harmful gases. Both bikes and cycles are human-powered modes of transportation, which makes them eco-friendly and sustainable. There are several reasons why these two options stand out when compared to the others: 1. Bikes and cycles:    - Provide an excellent cardiovascular workout: Cycling helps strengthen your heart muscles, lower your resting pulse, and reduce blood fat levels, contributing to overall cardiovascular fitness.    - Improve muscle strength and flexibility: This activity works on your leg muscles, particularly the quadriceps, hamstrings, and calves, leading to increased strength and flexibility in these muscle groups.    - Aid weight loss and maintenance: Cycling burns calories effectively, resulting in weight loss if combined with a balanced diet and a healthy lifestyle. Since it is easy on the joints, it can be a preferred choice for those looking to lose weight healthily.    - Reduce stress and anxiety: Cycling can improve mental well-being by releasing endorphins, the body's natural feel-good chemicals. It also helps to ease stress and anxiety by offering a relaxing way to enjoy the outdoors and escape the pressures of everyday life.    - Promote better lung health: Cycling encourages deep breathing, which helps in increasing the capacity of your lungs and keeps them healthy.    - Contribute to a greener environment: As cycling does not emit any harmful gases, it significantly reduces air pollution and contributes to a healthier environment. 2. Comparing other options:    - Cows and goats: Although riding cows and goats might seem like an interesting idea, it is quite impractical. These animals are not designed to carry human weight for long durations, and the stress on the animal could lead to adverse health effects. Additionally, these animals are not widely available for riding purposes in urban and suburban settings.    - Stairmaster: While a stairmaster can provide a good workout, it is an indoor gym equipment and does not offer the same environmental benefits as biking does. It might consume electricity, contributing to the energy used by the gym.    - Bus and trolley: These are forms of public transportation that produce pollution. Although they are better alternatives to driving individual cars, they are not suitable for achieving personal fitness, as users are passively transported and do not engage in physical activity.    - Lift: A lift, or elevator, is not suitable for exercise and also consumes electricity. In contrast, taking the stairs instead of using a lift can provide some form of physical activity. In conclusion, among the given options, riding a bike or using cycles is the most effective and environmentally friendly way to get good exercise and avoid producing harmful gases. These modes of transportation not only help in maintaining personal health and fitness but also contribute to the well-being of our environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the name of the character who is threatened after he causes a disturbance? is inside the article: During Prohibition, Laurel and Hardy are sent to prison for concocting and selling their own home brew. They are put in a cell with \\"Tiger\\" Long, the roughest, toughest and meanest of all inmates. Stan has a loose tooth that causes him to emit a razzberry at the end of every sentence; the inmate interprets this as a coolly defiant attitude and is impressed—nobody else ever stood up to him like that. He and Stan become fast friends. Laurel & Hardy are assigned to attend prison school with James Finlayson being the teacher. The vaudeville routine that follows ends with a spitball meant for somebody else hitting the teacher in the face and the boys wind up in solitary. There is a sustained scene of the bleak cells with the unseen boys conversing through the walls. After a prison break, the boys escape to a cotton plantation, where they hide out undetected, in blackface. The boys sing \\"Lazy Moon\\". When they attempt to repair the warden's car, they are discovered and are sent back to prison. The prison authorities decide to send Laurel to the prison dentist to have the offending tooth pulled, but the dentist is incompetent and the procedure goes awry. Tricked by a prison guard into calling off a hunger strike by being promised a thanksgiving-style feast, they go to the mess hall, only to be served the usual drab fare. Laurel causes a disturbance by protesting the absence of the feast, but is threatened by the guards. Soon after, as guns are being passed around under the tables, Laurel sets off his gun and causes an uproar. They inadvertently break up the prison riot and the grateful warden issues them a pardon. Laurel unintentionally \\"razzes\\" the warden and their exit from the prison has to be a very fast one., can you guess it ? Answer:","output":"The name of the character who is threatened after causing a disturbance in the article is Stan Laurel, who is a part of the comedy duo Laurel and Hardy. The disturbance occurs when Stan protests the absence of the promised feast in the mess hall, which leads to him being threatened by the guards."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"In which century did organized crime not fall in New York?\\"  Context: \\"Organized crime has long been associated with New York City, beginning with the Forty Thieves and the Roach Guards in the Five Points in the 1820s. The 20th century saw a rise in the Mafia, dominated by the Five Families, as well as in gangs, including the Black Spades. The Mafia presence has declined in the city in the 21st century.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"Given the context provided, organized crime did not fall in New York City within the 20th century. It is apparent from the passage that organized crime has been a significant issue in New York City, going back as far as the 1820s with the groups known as the Forty Thieves and the Roach Guards in the Five Points area. It indicates that the 20th century saw an upsurge in organized crime, particularly involving the Mafia. The context highlights that during the 20th century, the Mafia, dominated by the five leading or notable families, saw a rising influence, as well as other gangs such as the Black Spades. The Five Families, known to be at the core of the American Mafia, were powerful Italian-American crime families that leveraged their power through organized crime to control economic and political activities. The five families were the Bonanno, Colombo, Gambino, Genovese, and Lucchese families. What's clear from this passage is that organized crime did not decrease or fall in the 20th century in New York City, but rather significantly increased. Gangs became more structured and exerted stronghold over different sections of the city. The Mafia's influence stretched across numerous sectors, from local businesses, drug trafficking, and racketeering, to high-profile economic areas, impacting the city's socio-economic structure. However, the situation began to change over the course of the 21st century. The text mentions that the Mafia's presence in the city saw a decline during the early part of this century. Although it doesn't elaborate on the reasons behind this, possible explanations could be enforcement of tougher laws, increased penalties for organized crime, better law enforcement strategies, and greater emphasis on tackling organized crime at multiple levels by the city’s law enforcement agencies. Despite this, one can infer that the effects of organized crime are still felt to an extent in the present age. Therefore, with respect to the original question, the 20th century was a period when organized crime did not fall, but rather augmented in New York City."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After Moon's assistant Zao discovers that Bond is a British agent, Moon attempts to kill Bond and a hovercraft chase ensues, which ends with Moon's apparent death. Bond survives, but is captured by North Korean soldiers and imprisoned by the Colonel's father, General Moon. After 14 months of captivity and torture, Bond is traded for Zao in a prisoner exchange. He is sedated and taken to meet M, who informs him that his status as a 00 Agent is suspended under suspicion of having leaked information under duress.

The police refused and Oan pushed Ezzati, who he had been holding at gunpoint at the window, across the room, before demanding to speak to somebody from the BBC who knew Sim Harris. The police, relieved to have a demand to which they could easily agree, produced Tony Crabb, managing director of BBC Television News and Harris's boss. Oan shouted his demands; for safe passage out of the UK, to be negotiated by three ambassadors from Arab countries, to Crabb from the first-floor window, and instructed that they should be broadcast along with a statement of the hostage-takers' aims by the BBC. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office informally approached the embassies of Algeria, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Syria and Qatar to ask if their ambassadors would be willing to talk to the hostage-takers.

He worried also lest Pakistani authorities not get adequate warning, think the missiles came from India, RESPONSES TO AL QAEDA'S INITIAL ASSAULTS 135 and do something that everyone would later regret. Discussing potential repercussions in the region of his military responsibility, Zinni said, \\"It was easy to take the shot from Washington and walk away from it. We had to live there.\\" Zinni's distinct preference would have been to build up counterterrorism capabilities in neighboring countries such as Uzbekistan. But he told us that he could not drum up much interest in or money for such a purpose from Washington, partly, he thought, because these countries had dictatorial governments. After the decision-in which fear of collateral damage was an important factor- not to use cruise missiles against Kandahar in December 1998, Shelton and officers in the Pentagon developed plans for using an AC-130 gunship instead of cruise missile strikes. Designed specifically for the special forces, the version of the AC-130 known as \\"Spooky\\"can fly in fast or from high altitude, undetected by radar; guided to its zone by extraordinarily complex electronics, it is capable of rapidly firing precision-guided 25, 40, and 105 mm projectiles. Because this system could target more precisely than a salvo of cruise missiles, it had a much lower risk of causing collateral damage. After giving Clarke a briefing and being encouraged to proceed, Shelton formally directed Zinni and General Peter Schoomaker, who headed the Special Operations Command, to develop plans for an AC-130 mission against  Bin Laden's headquarters and infrastructure in Afghanistan. The Joint Staff prepared a decision paper for deployment of the Special Operations aircraft. Though Berger and Clarke continued to indicate interest in this option, the AC-130s were never deployed. Clarke wrote at the time that Zinni opposed their use, and John Maher, the Joint Staff 's deputy director of operations, agreed that this was Zinni's position. Zinni himself does not recall blocking the option. He told us that he understood the Special Operations Command had never thought the intelligence good enough to justify actually moving AC-130s into position. Schoomaker says, on the contrary, that he thought the AC-130 option feasible. The most likely explanation for the two generals' differing recollections is that both of them thought serious preparation for any such operations would require a long-term redeployment of Special Operations forces to the Middle East or South Asia. The AC-130s would need bases because the aircraft's unrefueled range was only a little over 2,000 miles.

However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22]  Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23]  and the situation: Two brothers had bike repair shops in neighboring towns.

Without this word, we wouldn't know who or what is looking for nectar. 2. \\"looking\\" - This is the action verb and describes what the butterflies are doing in the context of the sentence. It is crucial because it conveys the primary activity and purpose of the butterflies in this context. 3. \\"for\\" - While it is a preposition that connects the action to its objective, it doesn't carry significant meaning on its own and, therefore, isn't essential in terms of importance. 4. \\"nectar\\" - This word is the object and an essential part of the sentence because it represents what the butterflies are searching for. Without this word, we wouldn't know the intention behind the butterflies' actions. 5. \\"in\\" - Similar to \\"for\\", this is a preposition that connects the action to its location, but it doesn't convey importance by itself. 6. \\"the\\" - An article that simply specifies the referred target (garden), it doesn't hold much importance in the sentence. 7. \\"garden\\" - This word provides the context for the butterflies' behavior, describing where they are looking for nectar.

He said the album contained some \\"incredible moments\\", praising \\"Head Up in the Clouds\\", and calling \\"Nobody Sees\\" \\"Powderfinger at their devastating best\\", while giving the album four stars.Cameron Adams of Herald Sun HiT stated that the album contained no new directions for the band, and was highly consistent. He noted that the album contained less \\"rough edges and attitude\\" than predecessor Vulture Street, and likening the album more to Odyssey Number Five. Sputnikmusic's James Bishop agreed, claiming the band should be concerned by the \\"lack of experimentation or ambition\\" on the album. He again stated that the album was consistent, noting that \\"there actually isn't a bad song present\\". The review, which gave the album three and a half stars, commented that it seemed the band were trying to move towards the bluegrass genre, and \\"edging their way into the adult-contemporary section\\" of a music store, something they had not shown on their previous works.AllMusic's Clayton Bolger drew comparisons to Internationalist in his review, which gave the album 3 and a half stars.

Solve this instance: I've been kinda seeing this girl lately, I'm 27M and she's 21F, and for the most part things have been going fine, although there is still a little bit of immaturity on her side.  Anyways, I was driving her back to her house and cutting through some back roads and we see some people walking up the street.  I live in the Northeast and it's very cold outside right now.  She sees them and gets this huge smile on her face and tells me to \\"watch this.\\"  She starts rolling her window down and starts opening up her water bottle.  At this point I'm pretty sure she's going to douse them with water in frigid temperatures.  I tell her not to do it, but as we drive by them she flings the water out of her water bottle all over them and laughs and gives me the biggest shit eating grin. I was fucking pissed, because I'm pretty sure what she just did could be considered assault and if they got my liscense plate I could be liable.  So I pulled over about 100 yards past her victims (they could still see us) and told her to get the fuck out of my car.  She looked at me shocked like she did nothing wrong and refused.  I reached across and opened the car door, and then unbuckled her seatbelt and told her to get the fuck out of my car again.  Again she wouldn't and told me to just drive her home.  So I pushed her out of the car, drove forward a little bit so she couldn't scramble back in, and tossed her purse out a little further up.  And then I drove off and left her on the side of the road. Obviously she blew up my phone calling me an asshole, and its needless to say that whatever this relationship was it's over at this point.  I dont think I was out of line, but she did only have a sweatshirt which is not the best in freezing weather.  She claimed she had to run away because the people she flung water at started coming at her.  And I know she's broke ass, so it's not like she could call an Uber or Lyft, she would have had to get a friend or family give her a ride if she could find someone (she had her phone), otherwise it was probably a 6-7 mile walk home. I dont feel bad for kicking her out of my car, what has me doubting myself is the conditions I left her in (potentially violent situation, no heavy winter clothing, and broke).  AITA?

Answer the following question: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"photosynthesis is when what converts from carbon dioxide, water and solar energy into carbohydrates?\\" is \\"reproduction\\", given that  photosynthesis means plants convert from carbon dioxide, water, and solar energy into carbohydrates for themselves? Pick your answer from: [1]. Yes [2]. No Answer:","output":"Answer: [2]. No Photosynthesis is a process that allows plants, algae, and certain bacteria to convert light energy from the sun into chemical energy in the form of carbohydrates, such as glucose. To answer the given question, let's consider the details of this process and why the answer \\"reproduction\\" is incorrect. During photosynthesis, plants take in carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and water (H2O) from their roots. They use light energy from the sun to power a series of chemical reactions that convert these reactants into glucose (C6H12O6) and oxygen (O2). This process can be summarized by the following equation: 6CO2 + 6H2O + Light energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2 Photosynthesis isn't simply beneficial for the individual plant; it is also crucial for life on Earth as it provides the oxygen we breathe and the energy we consume via the food chain. Additionally, it helps regulate global levels of carbon dioxide, which is an essential factor in addressing climate change. Reproduction, on the other hand, is a biological process through which new offspring are produced by an organism. In plants, reproduction can occur via sexual reproduction, involving the formation of seeds and pollination, or asexual reproduction, such as producing new plants through vegetative propagation. It plays a vital role in maintaining genetic diversity and ensuring the continuation of species, but it is not directly related to the photosynthetic process of converting CO2, water, and light energy into carbohydrates. Given the definition and function of photosynthesis, it is clear that the right answer to the question \\"photosynthesis is when what converts from carbon dioxide, water, and solar energy into carbohydrates?\\" is not \\"reproduction.\\" Instead, the answer should reflect the process through which plants use light energy to produce carbohydrates, such as \\"the process in which plants convert CO2, water, and solar energy into glucose and release oxygen as a byproduct.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

His demise, resulting from smoke inhalation and thermal burns, has earned him a place amongst the latest entrants for the Darwin Awards. The bizarre incident occurred on a Saturday, when Caldwell seemingly got stuck in the chimney of the house he was allegedly trying to break into. The Fresno County Sheriff's Office reported that the homeowner had been away and returned to the home that same day. It is believed that Caldwell tried to enter the house overnight on Friday and became lodged in the chimney. Unaware of Caldwell’s presence, the homeowner lit a fire in the fireplace around 3 pm.

The mortgage on the shoe is owned by the villainous Silas Barnaby (Henry Brandon), who is looking to marry Bo Peep. Knowing the Widow Peep is having a difficult time paying the mortgage, Barnaby offers the old woman an ultimatum â unless Bo Peep agrees to marry him he will foreclose on the shoe. Widow Peep refuses, but is worried about where she'll get the money to pay the mortgage. Ollie offers her all the money he has stored away in his savings can, only to learn that Stannie has taken it to buy peewees (a favored toy consisting of a wooden peg with tapered ends that rises in the air when struck with a stick near one end and is then caused to fly through the air by being struck again with the stick). He and Stannie set out to get the money for the mortgage from their boss, the Toymaker (William Burress). But Stannie has mixed up an order from Santa Claus (building 100 wooden soldiers at six feet tall, instead of 600 soldiers at one foot tall) and one of the soldiers, when activated, wrecks the toy shop. Stannie and Ollie are fired without getting the money. The two then hatch a plan to sneak into Barnaby's house and steal the mortgage, but are again foiled by their incompetence. Barnaby has them arrested on a burglary charge, and the two are sentenced to be dunked in the ducking stool and then banished to Bogeyland. But Barnaby agrees to drop the charges if Bo Peep will marry him. She reluctantly agrees, but not before Ollie suffers the dunking. Stannie and Ollie come up with a new scheme.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Tokugawa Takes All: When Hideyoshi died in 1598, he hoped to have his five-year-old son continue his \\"dynasty,\\" initially under the tutelage of five regents. But one of the regents was Ieyasu Tokugawa, who had been biding his time at Edo for 12 years, nurturing dynastic ambitions of his own. Of the cunning, ruthless triumvirate that came out on top at the end of the country's century of civil war, Tokugawa was without doubt the most patient, the most prudent — and most treacherous. He moved quickly to eliminate his strongest rivals, crushing them in 1600 at the great Battle of Sekigahara (near modern Nagoya). During its subsequent two and a half centuries of rule from the new capital established at Edo, the Tokugawa organized a tightly controlled coalition of some 260 daimyo in strategic strongholds throughout the country. The allegiance of this highly privileged and prestigious group was ensured by cementing their ethical principles in the code of bushido, \\"The way of the warrior\\": loyalty to one's master, defense of one's status and honor, and fulfillment of all obligations. Loyalty was further enforced by holding the vassals' wives and children hostage in Edo. All roads into Edo, the most famous being the Tokaido Highway, had checkpoints for guns coming in and for wives going out. One of the most effective ways of keeping a tight rein on the country was to cut it off from the outside world, to keep Japan Japanese. At first, Ieyasu Tokugawa was eager to promote foreign trade. He wanted silk and encouraged the Dutch and British as good, nonproselytizing Protestants just interested in trade. But he didn't like the Portuguese and Spanish Catholic missionaries, who he felt were undermining traditional Japanese values. He banned their activities in 1612 and two years later ordered the expulsion of all missionaries and unrepentant Japanese converts. Executions and torture followed. Converts were forced to renounce their faith by trampling crucifixes and effigies of Jesus and Mary. The Catholic Church has counted 3,125 martyrs in Japan from 1597 (beginning under Hideyoshi) to 1660. In 1635 the Japanese were forbidden, on pain of death, to attempt to travel abroad, and Japanese citizens already overseas were prevented from returning, in case they brought back subversive Christian doctrines. Western books were banned, as were Chinese books that mentioned Christianity.  Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"He banned all of them\\" correctly answer the question \\"Contrast Tokugawa's attitude toward the British and Dutch traders and the Portuguese and Spanish missionaries.\\"?","output":"No, the response \\"He banned all of them\\" does not correctly answer the question \\"Contrast Tokugawa's attitude toward the British and Dutch traders and the Portuguese and Spanish missionaries.\\" Rather, a detailed and long answer should look like this: Ieyasu Tokugawa had different attitudes towards the British and Dutch traders compared to the Portuguese and Spanish missionaries. Initially, Tokugawa was eager to promote foreign trade and wanted silk. He found the Dutch and British traders favorable since they were non-proselytizing Protestants focused mainly on trading activities. Tokugawa saw them as good trade partners without interference in Japan's religious and cultural matters. On the other hand, Tokugawa had a negative perception of the Portuguese and Spanish Catholic missionaries. He believed that they were undermining traditional Japanese values by introducing and spreading Christianity in Japan. Due to his concerns about the influence of Christianity in Japan, he banned missionary activities in 1612 and later, in 1614, ordered the expulsion of all missionaries and unrepentant Japanese converts who refused to renounce Christianity. This prompted a series of persecutions, leading to executions, torture, and forced renunciations. In the succeeding years, Tokugawa's government continued to impose isolationist policies to protect Japan from foreign influences. Japanese citizens were forbidden to travel abroad or return if they were already overseas, with the fear of them bringing back potentially subversive ideologies, particularly Christian doctrines. Western and certain Chinese books that mentioned Christianity were also banned. Thus, while Tokugawa appreciated the trade benefits from his alliances with the British and Dutch, his primary concern was to preserve the country's cultural integrity and maintain political control by suppressing the growth of foreign religions, such as Christianity introduced by Portuguese and Spanish missionaries."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: My Girl Context: The movie is set in Madison, Pennsylvania, in the summer of 1972. Vada Sultenfuss (Anna Chlumsky) is a 11-year-old girl and a hypochondriac. Vada's father, Harry Sultenfuss (Dan Aykroyd), is an awkward widower who does not seem to understand his daughter, and as a result, constantly ignores her. His profession as a funeral director, in which the Sultenfuss' residence is also a funeral parlor, has led Vada to develop an obsession with death as well as disease. Vada also thinks that she killed her own mother, since her mother died giving birth to her. She regularly tends to her invalid grandmother (Ann Nelson), who suffers from Alzheimer's disease. Harry's brother Phil (Richard Masur), who lives nearby, also stops by frequently to help out the family.Vada is teased by other girls because her best friend, Thomas J. Sennett (Macaulay Culkin), is unpopular and a boy. Their summer adventures from first kiss to last farewell introduce Vada to the world of adolescence.Vada's summer begins well. She befriends Shelley Devoto (Jamie Lee Curtis), the new make-up artist at her father's funeral parlor, who provides her with some much needed guidance. She is also infatuated with her teacher, Mr. Bixler (Griffin Dunne), and steals some money from Shelley's trailer to attend a summer writing class that he is teaching.But before long, things start to fall apart. Her father and Shelley start dating and get engaged, she cannot bring herself to tell her father that she has experienced her first menstrual cycle, Thomas J. dies from an allergic reaction to bee stings while looking for Vada's mood ring in the woods, and she finds out that Mr. Bixler is engaged to someone else.Vada's grief, however, manages to mend the rift between her and her father, she learns that she didn't kill her mom during childbirth (since her father tells her that things like mothers dying in childbirth just happen), and by the end of the movie, Vada has not only managed to deal with her pain and grief, but has also overcome some of her previous issues as well.","output":"Thomas J.

He inherited the Gwalior gharana and the Gandharva Mahavidyalaya , but he was always open to adopting aesthetic features of other gharanas and styles .","output":"While these two sentences convey very similar ideas, there are slight differences in their structure and the choice of words. Let's break down the sentences in detail to analyze their meanings: 1. \\"He inherited the Gwalior - Gharana and the Gandharva - Mahavidyalaya, but he was always open to taking aesthetic features of other gharanas and styles.\\"        This sentence highlights that the person inherited two distinct aspects: the Gwalior Gharana and the Gandharva Mahavidyalaya. The term \\"Gharana\\" refers to a particular tradition or style of Indian classical music, while \\"Gandharva Mahavidyalaya\\" is an institution that imparts training in Indian classical dance and music forms. The use of hyphen (-) in the terms can be interpreted as an emphasis on the distinction between these two aspects. Additionally, the word 'taking' implies that he actively borrowed or collected aesthetic features from other gharanas and styles. 2. \\"He inherited the Gwalior gharana and the Gandharva Mahavidyalaya, but he was always open to adopting aesthetic features of other gharanas and styles.\\"    This sentence uses the same terms as the previous one, but without the hyphens, indicating that the two aspects (Gwalior Gharana and Gandharva Mahavidyalaya) may still function as separate entities, but perhaps with a closely related connection. The term 'adopting,' as opposed to 'taking,' suggests that the person not only borrows or collects aesthetic features from other gharanas and styles but also possibly integrates and assimilates those features into their own musical approach or teachings, allowing their style to evolve. In summary, these two sentences convey a slightly different emphasis in their word choices and punctuation, which may lead to a subtle variation in their meanings. However, in the broader context, both sentences put forth the idea that the person inherited the Gwalior Gharana and the Gandharva Mahavidyalaya while remaining open to the aesthetic elements of other gharanas and styles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Effusive opinions flowed from all directions: some saw the acquisition as a sensible fit for Microsoft to better support developers, and some saw it as a tyrant getting their grubby fingers on open source’s ecosystem. I am thrilled for Microsoft and GitHub for many reasons, and there will be a bright future ahead because of it, but I have been thinking more about the reaction some of the critics have had to this, and why. I find it fascinating that there still seems to be a deep-seated discomfort in some about Microsoft and their involvement in open source. I understand that this is for historical reasons, and many moons ago Microsoft were definitely on the offensive against open source. I too was critical of Microsoft and their approach back in those days. I may have even said ‘M’ instead of ‘MS’ (ugh.) Things have changed though. Satya Nadella, their CEO, has had a profound impact on the company: they are a significant investor and participant in open source across a multitude of open source projects, they hire many open source developers, run their own open source projects (e.g. VSCode), and actively sponsor and support many open source conferences, events, and initiatives.

In this situation, Roxxi Laveaux is in a position of authority as the new manager, and Christy Hemme is the one targeted for embarrassment. Sentence 2: At Victory Road, they introduced their new manager, the Voodoo Queen, Christy Hemme, to embarrass Roxxi Laveaux. In the second sentence, the setting remains the same: an event called Victory Road. However, this time, the new manager identified as 'the Voodoo Queen' is Christy Hemme, not Roxxi Laveaux. The purpose of this introduction in this sentence is to embarrass Roxxi Laveaux. The roles are essentially reversed; Christy Hemme assumes the authoritative managerial position and Roxxi Laveaux is the one being embarrassed. In conclusion, the two sentences present different situations in the same setting of Victory Road. The primary discrepancy lies in the roles and identities of Christy Hemme and Roxxi Laveaux. In Sentence 1, Roxxi Laveaux is the new manager aiming to embarrass Christy Hemme, while in Sentence 2, Christy Hemme is introduced as the new manager with the intention to embarrass Roxxi Laveaux. Due to these differences, the two sentences do not convey the same information."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the person who is assigned to train the new missionary? ?  The Best Two Years portrays the experience of four missionaries of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints living in the same apartment in Haarlem in the Netherlands.  The movie begins with Elder Rogers finding out that his new companion will be a \\"greenie\\", a newly trained missionary fresh from the Missionary Training Center.  He and the other two missionaries that reside in the same apartment, Elder Johnson and Elder Van Pelt, go to the train station to meet the new elder.  Elder Rogers finds out that the new missionary, Elder Calhoun, is exactly what he had jokingly predicted his new companion would be like. Elder Rogers used to be an excellent missionary, until his girlfriend married one of his former mission companions.  That is why he and the other two missionaries residing in the same apartment are surprised that the mission president has assigned him to be the trainer (first companion and mentor) to a missionary new to the mission. The new missionary, Elder Calhoun, tackles mission work with unbounded enthusiasm.  He attempts to talk to anyone although he has little knowledge of the Dutch language.  Despite his poor Dutch, he continues to have an eager attitude. Fortunately for him, he soon encounters a man from the United States that speaks English.  They speak briefly in the park before the man goes off with his girlfriend.  Later, when he encounters the same man in a market, Calhoun gives him a Dutch Book of Mormon with his telephone number.  Despite what the other three missionaries expect, the man does call and asks for Calhoun.

Question: Information:  - Post-hardcore is a punk rock music genre that derives from hardcore punk, maintaining hardcore's aggression and intensity, but emphasizes a greater degree of creative expression initially inspired by post-punk and noise rock. Like post-punk, the term has been applied to a broad constellation of groups. The genre took shape in the mid to late 1980s with releases by bands from cities that had established hardcore scenes, such as Fugazi from Washington, D.C. as well as groups such as Big Black and Jawbox that stuck closer to post-hardcore's noise rock roots.  - Q and Not U was a post-hardcore band from Washington, D.C., signed to Dischord Records. Members John Davis, Harris Klahr, Christopher Richards, and Matt Borlik formed the band in 1998. After Borlik's departure following the release of their first album, the band went on to record two more critically acclaimed LPs as a three-piece, exploring aspects of dance-punk, and other disparate musical styles. Q and Not U disbanded in September 2005 after completing their touring commitments and a short farewell stand at Washington, D.C. venue The Black Cat.  - Dance-punk (also known as disco-punk or punk funk) is a music genre that emerged in the late 1970s, and is closely associated with the post-punk and new wave movements.  - Power was the 3rd and final album by Q and Not U. It was released on October 5 , 2004 . After touring in support of the album , the group disbanded in September 2005 . The album was co-produced by Pete Cafarella and Rafael Cohen ( of Supersystem ) . All tracking was done at The Love Story in Brooklyn , NY . The album was mixed with Don Zientara at Inner Ear Studio and mastered by Chad Clark at Silver Sonya .  - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at  rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl.  - Dischord Records is a Washington, D.C.-based independent record label specializing in the independent punk rock music of the D.C.-area music scene. The label is co-owned by Ian MacKaye and Jeff Nelson, who founded Dischord in 1980 to release \\"Minor Disturbance\\" by The Teen Idles. Along with other independent American labels such as Twin/Tone, Touch and Go Records, and SST Records, Dischord helped to spearhead the nationwide network of underground bands that formed the pre-Nirvana indie-rock scene. These labels presided over the shift from the hardcore punk that then dominated the American underground scene to the more diverse styles of alternative rock that were emerging.  - The LP (from \\"long playing\\" or \\"long play\\") is an analog sound storage medium, a vinyl record format characterized by a speed of rpm, a 12 or 10 inch (30 or 25 cm) diameter, and use of the \\"microgroove\\" groove specification. Introduced by Columbia in 1948, it was soon adopted as a new standard by the entire record industry. Apart from a few relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of stereophonic sound, it has remained the standard format for vinyl albums.  - MPEG-1 and/or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III, more commonly referred to as MP3, is an audio coding format for digital audio which uses a form of lossy data compression. It is a common audio format for consumer audio streaming or storage, as well as a de facto standard of digital audio compression for the transfer and playback of music on most digital audio players and computing devices.  - A book is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of paper, parchment, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side, with text and/or images printed in ink. A single sheet within a book is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page. A set of text-filled or illustrated pages produced in electronic format is known as an electronic book, or e-book.   - Compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format released in 1982 and co-developed by Philips and Sony. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. Audio CD players have been commercially available since October 1982, when the first commercially available CD player was released in Japan.

On the other hand, the hypothesis states that \\"Bray is the first stop on the DART.\\" This statement contradicts the given premise, as it suggests that Bray serves as the starting point on the DART line, rather than the endpoint that the initial premise mentions. When evaluating whether a premise entails a hypothesis, it is crucial to consider whether the proposed hypothesis is a logical extension or a necessary consequence of the premise. In this case, the premise and hypothesis are not consistent. Instead, they present differing perspectives on Bray's location on the DART line. One portrays Bray as the last stop, while the other suggests it is the first stop, creating a clear contradiction between the two statements.

They have sold over 12 million records worldwide. Over the course of their career, the band has received three Grammy Award nominations, contributed to numerous motion picture soundtracks and toured internationally. In a statement made by the band's manager on their MySpace page, it was officially announced, on December 30, 2006, that Jason Truby had left the band. They had said \\"God worked it out because Truby decided to leave the band the same day Curiel asked to rejoin.\\" Curiel performed with the band for the first time since his departure on the 2006 New Year's Eve episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live!.  On February 2, 2007 the band made a new record deal with INO Records.

Given the question: Given the below context:  Every night on the tour to support their 2000 album Return of Saturn, No Doubt threw after-show parties where people danced to Jamaican dancehall music. During a discussion over dinner in late 2000, the band members decided they wanted to explore dancehall-style rhythms for their next album. Drawing inspiration from artists such as Bounty Killer, Cutty Ranks, and Mr. Vegas, the band began work on the album in January 2001 by creating beats on Pro Tools at guitarist Tom Dumont's apartment. The group often tried recreating beats from other song files on the computer, which resulted in modified versions of the original rhythms. They worked with producer Philip Steir at Toast Studios in San Francisco during this time, where the beginnings of \\"Hey Baby\\" emerged. When writing lyrics for previous albums, Stefani typically read works by Sylvia Plath that would make her depressed \\"or find different words that inspire me.\\" In contrast, for Rock Steady she wrote the lyrics quicker and on the spot to meet the goal of writing a song a day. Many of the demos recorded during these early sessions were used in the final tracks, rather than completely reworking the songs. The band saw this as a way to preserve the \\"initial spark\\" from when the songs were conceived.The next month, Stefani left Los Angeles for London to visit boyfriend Rossdale, and the band traveled with her to finish recording \\"Detective\\". There, they worked with Eurythmics member David A. Stewart and wrote the song \\"Underneath It All\\" in only 10 minutes. In March, No Doubt traveled to Jamaica, staying at the Blue Lagoon in Port Antonio. The band \\"spent most of the time swimming and getting sunburned and drinking and smoking and recording a little music\\", according to Dumont. The group would often have Red Stripe beers or rum and cokes with jerk food for breakfast; on one occasion, Dumont passed out from heavy drinking while recording a track.

She was taken in by elderly Fuzzy (Henry Travers), and gave birth to Mickey (Jackie Kelk) in the back room of Fuzzy's bookstore at the age of fifteen. Embittered, she taught Mickey to be street smart so he will never be taken advantage of like her. Fuzzy strongly disapproves of how she is raising her son. Now seven years old, Mickey skips school and does as he pleases. Meanwhile, Letty earns a living by entertaining buyers so they will give business to her friend Steve Karns. A milk truck driven by Malcolm \\"Mal\\" Trevor (Cary Grant) hits Mickey as he is rollerskating in the street. When Letty's lawyer, Adolphe, learns that Mal is the wealthy president of Amalgamated Dairies (out checking every aspect of his large business), he talks Letty into seizing the opportunity to make some money. They get Mickey to lie about the extent of his injuries. However, during the trial, Mal's attorney (Paul Harvey) produces films showing Mickey fully recovered. The irate judge has Mickey taken from Letty and put in an institution for boys. Mal and his wife Alyce (Marion Burns) have no children. Mal offers to adopt Mickey, with Letty's approval, so she can see her son more frequently. Mickey thrives on Mal's country estate and the loving parenting he receives. Letty is not satisfied with this arrangement; she wants her son back. Adolph suggests she seduce Mal and blackmail him into giving her Mickey (as well as money) with a recording of their conversation. The plan works; Mal admits he has fallen in love with her, and they spend the night together. The next morning, however, Mal informs a surprised Letty that he has told his wife. Alyce is willing to sacrifice herself for Mal's happiness. Letty comes to realize her genuine feelings for Mal, and breaks up with him, pretending to have only been toying with him.

Option 1 - \\"Very different in all its chemical and physical properties\\"  Enantiomers of a molecule are not very different in all their chemical and physical properties. The two forms are identical in most ways except one: they are mirror-images of each other and hence, this statement is false. So, we're going to classify this as '4' because it is incorrect. 2.

So we can classify this as '1', which stands for correct information. 3. Option 3 - \\"Distinguishable by their optical activity\\" This is also a true statement. Enantiomers can be distinguished by their optical activity because they rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions. So, this answer will be classified as '1' as well. 4. Option 4 - \\"The result of the cyclization of a molecule in different positions\\" Enantiomers are not the result of cyclization of a molecule. They are a result of a chiral center in the molecule. This statement is false, so we can classify this as '4'. 5. Option 5- \\"Interconvertible without rupture of covalent bonds\\" This is typically false for enantiomers. Usually, to interconvert between enantiomers, you would need to break and reform bonds, specifically at the chiral center. Therefore, it is false and will be classified as '4'.  The output of this task should be your classifications for each statement: 1-4, 2-1, 3-1, 4-4, 5-4."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This means that Ochagavia is a group of plants belonging to a specific family and subfamily. 2. The genus is named for Sylvestris Ochagavia, the Chilean minister of education, indicating that the name comes from a historical figure, rather than any direct relation to food or meals. 3. The context highlights that Ochagavia is endemic to southern and central Chile, so it does grow in the region; however, there is no specific mention of it being used or consumed as a meal. 4. The context also mentions four accepted species within the Ochagavia genus, but no information is provided regarding their culinary use or popularity in Chile.

The scientists say that the human body has changed very little since human first appeared on earth, but the way we live has changed greatly. Our body has not been able to deal with these changes in life style and this has led to new kinds of sicknesses. These new sicknesses were not known in ancient times. So they are called \\"diseases of civilization\\". Many cancers and diseases of the blood system, including heart attacks and strokes  are examples of such diseases. Scientists noted that early stone-age people used very little alcohol or tobacco, probably none. Ancient people also got a great deal of physical exercise, but a change in food is one of the main differences between life in ancient times and life today. Stone-age people hunted wild animals for their meat, which had much less fat than farm animals. They also ate a lot of fresh wild vegetables, and fruits. They did not use milk and other dairy products, and they made very little use of grains. But today, we eat a large amount of dairy products and grain foods. We eat six times more salt than stone-age people. We eat more sugar. We eat twice as much fat but only one third as much protein and much less vitamin C. People today probably do not want to live as people thousands of years ago did, but scientists say that we would be much healthier if we ate as those ancient people did, cutting the amount of fatty, salty and sweet foods. Question: What is the main cause mentioned in the article why people suffer from a lot of new sicknesses? Answer: A:","output":"The main cause mentioned in the article for people suffering from a lot of new sicknesses, also referred to as \\"diseases of civilization,\\" is the drastic shift in diet and lifestyle compared to what our ancestors experienced more than 10,000 years ago. The human body has changed very little since its first appearance, but the way we live, including our diets, has undergone significant changes. The consumption of fatty, salty, and sweet foods has increased, along with the intake of dairy products and grain-based foods. Additionally, people nowadays use more alcohol and tobacco and engage in less physical activity. These changes have led to health issues such as cancers, heart attacks, and strokes, which were not prevalent in ancient times. Scientists suggest that adopting a dietary and lifestyle approach similar to that of our ancient ancestors could lead to improved health and reduced risks of these modern diseases."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After sight-seeing in Sydney, they head for the Outback to attend the Vampire Rock Music Festival. Legend says that Vampire Rock is the home of the Yoweeyahoo, an ancient Australian vampire.The events of last year's festival are making Malcolm, Daniel, and co-promoter Russell very nervous. Following the festival, one of the bands called Wild Wind went camping on Vampire Rock and were never heard from again. Rumor has it that all three were kidnapped by the Yoweeyahoo and turned into vampires. Now, strange things are happening at this year's festival--sounds, lights, and smoke are issuing from Vampire Rock.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. It was hard for me to believe all of the negative comments regarding this all-star flick. I laughed through the entire picture, as did my entire family. The movie clearly defined itself as an old time gangster comedy--the players were hysterical--I'll bet they had a good old time while making it. Of course Goldblum and Dreyfuss were great--and how about those Everly sisters, each of the two Falco's, and the divine music throughout. Rob Reiner made a great laughing limo driver, and Gabriel Byrne a laughable neurotic. Not to mention Gregory Hines, Burt Reynolds, the Sleepy Joe character and the whole mortuary and grave digger references. Paul Anka was his usual entertaining self, with the added attraction of running scared after Byrne decided to make a duet of his \\"My Way\\" welcome home to Vick performance. I am of the opinion that this movie was a comical tribute to Frank Sinatra and friends; Dreyfuss imitated him well. I am also of the opinion that no one, of any age, would even think of imitating the actions which occurred in this movie--it's a joke--not a terrifying \\"gangsta\\" film. The cars and clothing were impressive, as was the decorative, \\"Vic's Place.\\" Truly, I think of \\"Mad Dog Time\\" as a musical comedy, less harmful than many cartoons, TV crime dramas, and talk shows.

The premise is \\"Men in traditional Scottish attire marching and playing bagpipes.\\" Based on this statement, there are several details described: 1. Men are involved in the scene. 2. They are wearing traditional Scottish attire. 3. They are marching. 4. They are playing bagpipes. The hypothesis, \\"Bagpipe players are marching in the band,\\" is a reasonable assertion given the premise as it aligns with the provided information. Since bagpipes are being played in the given context, it signifies that there are bagpipe players involved. Additionally, the premise mentions that these men are marching, which is a characteristic of a typical band configuration, particularly in parades, ceremonial events, or other similar settings. To provide further context to support this conclusion, traditional Scottish attire generally refers to, among other things, wearing kilts and tartans, representing specific families or clans. The bagpipes are a conventional Scottish musical instrument, and their use in marches or parades is a longstanding tradition that showcases cultural pride. Moreover, marching bands featuring bagpipe players are not unusual and serve to entertain audiences while maintaining a musical and coordinated presentation.

(Associated Press)      In this undated photo released by the Center for Disease Control, a Aeromedical Biological Containment System which looks like a sealed isolation tent for Ebola air transportation is shown. On Thursday... (Associated Press)      The answer, experts say, is because Emory University Hospital is one of the safest places in the world to treat someone with Ebola. There's virtually no chance the virus can spread from the hospital's super-secure isolation unit.      And another thing, they say: medical workers risking their lives overseas deserve the best treatment they can get.      Dr. Kent Brantly became the first person infected with Ebola to be brought to the United States from Africa. He arrived Saturday at one of the nation's best hospitals. Fellow aid worker Nancy Writebol was expected to arrive in several days.      \\"I hope that our understandable fear of the unfamiliar does not trump our compassion when ill Americans return to the U.S. for care,\\" said Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. His agency received \\"nasty emails\\" and at least 100 calls from people questioning why the sick aid workers should be let into the United States.      Despite the calls and messages directed to the CDC, few of those nearest the hospital Saturday seemed concerned.      \\"I just think it's a blessing that we can help possibly make the infected person's life a little more tolerable,\\" said Ashley Wheeler, who was shopping just down the street on Saturday. \\"If I were that person I would want my country to help me the best way they could.\\"      Emory's infectious diseases' unit was created 12 years ago to handle doctors who get sick at the CDC. It is one of about four in the country equipped with everything necessary to test, treat and contain people exposed to very dangerous viruses.      In 2005, it handled patients with SARS, which unlike Ebola can spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes.      In fact, the nature of Ebola — which is spread by close contact with bodily fluids and blood — means that any modern hospital using standard, rigorous, infection-control measures should be able to handle it.      Still, Emory won't be taking any chances.      \\"Nothing comes out of this unit until it is non-infectious,\\" said Dr. Bruce Ribner, who will be treating the patients. \\"The bottom line is: We have an inordinate amount of safety associated with the care of this patient. And we do not believe that any health care worker, any other patient or any visitor to our facility is in any way at risk of acquiring this infection.\\"      Ribner also said the patients deserve help.      \\"They have gone over on a humanitarian mission, they have become infected through medical care and we feel that we have the environment and expertise to safely care for these patients and offer them the maximum opportunity for recovery from these infections,\\" he said Friday.      Amber Brantly was heartened to see her husband climb out of the ambulance that met his plane at Dobbins Air Reserve Base outside Atlanta.      \\"It was a relief to welcome Kent home today. I spoke with him, and he is glad to be back in the U.S.,\\" she said in a statement. \\"I am thankful to God for his safe transport and for giving him the strength to walk into the hospital.\\"      Inside the unit, patients are sealed off from anyone who doesn't wear protective gear.      \\"Negative air pressure\\" means air flows in, but can't escape until filters scrub any germs from patients. All laboratory testing is conducted within the unit, and workers are highly trained in infection control. Glass walls enable staff outside to safely observe patients, and there's a vestibule where workers suit up before entering. Any gear is safely disposed of or decontaminated.      Family members will be kept at a distance for now, the doctors said. The unit \\"has a plate glass window and communication system, so they'll be as close as 1-2 inches from each other,\\" Ribner said.      Dr. Jay Varkey, an infectious disease specialist who will be treating Brantly and Writebol, gave no word Saturday about their condition. Both have been described as critically ill after treating Ebola patients at a missionary hospital in Liberia, one of four West African countries hit by the largest outbreak of the virus in history.      There is no cure for the virus, which causes hemorrhagic fever that kills as many as 60-80 percent of the people it infects in Africa. There are experimental treatments, but the missionary hospital had only enough for one person, and Brantly insisted that Writebol receive it. His best hope in Africa was a transfusion of blood including antibodies from one of his patients, a 14-year-old boy who survived thanks to the doctor.      There was also only room on the plane for one patient at a time. Writebol will be next, following the same route to Emory in several days.      ___      Medical Writers Mike Stobbe and Marilynn Marchione reported from New York and Milwaukee.

(Photo: Samaritan's Purse)      A second American stricken with the Ebola virus is expected to return to the USA Tuesday, three days after a doctor being treated for the disease arrived at an Atlanta hospital for intensive care.      Nancy Writebol, a medical missionary aiding in the treatment of Ebola victims in Liberia, is scheduled to leave that African nation around 1 a.m. Tuesday on a specially equipped medical evacuation plane, Liberian Information Minister Lewis Brown said, according to the Associated Press.

Brantly is being treated in a special isolation unit at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta after arriving Saturday at Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Georgia. It's the first time anyone infected with the deadly virus has been brought into the country.      \\"We're hoping he'll continue to improve,\\" Dr. Tom Frieden told CBS' Face the Nation. \\"But Ebola is such a scary disease because it's so deadly. I can't predict the future for individual patients.\\"      Brantly and Writebol were serving in Liberia as medical missionaries when they became infected with the virus, which has killed 729 people and sickened more than 1,300 the West African nations of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.      Frieden has said his agency received \\"nasty\\" e-mails and at least 100 calls from people questioning why the sick aid workers should be let into the USA. Physicians are confident, however, that the two Americans can be treated without putting the public in danger.      (Photo: AP)      The virus is spread through direct contact with blood, urine, saliva and other bodily fluids from an infected person. It is not spread through the air.      \\"I don't think it's in the cards that we would have widespread Ebola,\\" Frieden said. He said the virus spreads in African hospitals where there isn't infection control and in burial rituals where people touch the bodies of Ebola victims. That won't happen here, he said.      \\"So it's not going to spread widely in the U.S. Could we have another person here, could we have a case or two? Not impossible,\\" Frieden said. \\"We say in medicine never say never. But we know how to stop it here. But to really protect ourselves, the single most important thing we can do is stop it at the source in Africa. That's going to protect them and protect us.\\"      Emory's infectious diseases unit was created 12 years ago to handle doctors who get sick at the CDC.

There's no specific treatment for Ebola so doctors try to ease symptoms, including fever, headache, vomiting and diarrhea. Some victims suffer severe bleeding.      Michael Stulman, a regional information officer in West and Central Africa for Catholic Relief Services, said Sunday that doctors and nurses there \\"are working in a particularly high-risk environment. They are typically are under-resourced. They're working 15- and even 20-hour days. Despite all their incredible efforts, sometimes mistakes happen and this is why we're seeing a fairly high number of Ebola-positive cases with nurses.\\"      Treatment centers \\"are reaching full capacity soon after they are set up,\\" he said in an e-mail. \\"Some of the observation units are not fully staffed. The cross-border nature of the outbreak and the accessibility of transport to major towns have made this outbreak particularly difficult to contain.\\"      Among the main challenges in containing the outbreak, he said, were several circulating myths, including one that said doctors at hospitals \\"will give you injections that kill you\\" instead of treating the illness. \\"As a result of these myths, some families who have sought care are discharging confirmed patients from the hospital and bringing them home before they are recovered. Other people who have Ebola never go to the hospital and instead choose to stay at home with their family, which puts their family at risk of contracting the disease when caring for them.\\"      Contributing: WXIA-TV in Atlanta; Doug Stanglin; the Associated Press      Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1ngxCSh ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The Ebola virus has killed many people in Africa and can be very dangerous.

Answer:","output":"\\"You Can't Take That Away From Me\\" is a popular song written by the iconic American songwriting duo of George Gershwin and Ira Gershwin. The brothers collaborated closely on numerous compositions throughout their careers, creating some of the most memorable songs in the American songbook. \\"You Can't Take That Away From Me\\" was one of their notable works, which has been recorded and covered by various artists over the years. The song was written in 1937 for the musical film \\"Shall We Dance,\\" where it was introduced by legendary performers Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. The music of the song was composed by George Gershwin, a prolific composer famous for his contributions to both American popular music and the classical repertoire. George's unique talent for combining jazz and classical elements made him a leading figure in the music world during the early 20th century. Meanwhile, the lyrics of \\"You Can't Take That Away From Me\\" were crafted by Ira Gershwin, George's elder brother, and a renowned lyricist in his own right. Ira's impressive command of language and his ability to create witty, sophisticated, and heartfelt lyrics made him the perfect collaborator for his brother's music. Together, they produced numerous successful compositions that have stood the test of time. \\"You Can't Take That Away From Me\\" is a romantic ballad that captures the essence of two lovers reminiscing about their shared experiences and the enduring memories that have shaped their relationship. Even if the relationship were to end, as suggested by some interpretations, the lovers would still cherish the memories they've made together.

I’ve been trying out two new ones to see which I prefer. In the red corner we have MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil and in the blue corner we have NARS Velvet Matte Lip Pencil. So let’s get ready to rumble while I put them through their paces…. Although the packaging of these two is quite similar the formulation and finish of the lip colours are very different – MAC Patent Polish is a light gloss and NARS Velvet Matte has a stark matte finish. So whether you prefer your lips sheer and glossy or pigmented and matte there should be something for everyone here. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil – this is the first lip pencil that I’ve tried from MAC (apart from lip liner) and I’m really impressed with it. As the name suggests the finish is a very shiny gloss that gives an almost patent shine, it has the feel of a lip gloss but it’s not sticky. The colour is called Spontaneous, MAC describe it as a ‘soft plum with pearl’. It’s definitely a plummy shade, although I can’t really detect any pearl in there. It looks quite dark as a crayon but as it’s very sheer it appears much more natural once it’s on the lips. It’s a great way to introduce darker lip colours to your make-up bag if you’re not used to them. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil is a bit like a fabulous giant tinted lip balm! The crayon itself is chunky and easy to hold, the nib is quite chunky and not great for precision application, but you could use a lip brush to apply it. I love to apply MAC Patent Polish straight from the crayon, it’s quick and easy, and as it’s very light and sheer it’s easy to wipe away any mistakes and re-apply. According to the above context, answer the following question. What is probably true about the author? A:","output":"The author is likely someone who is interested in makeup and beauty products, as they are testing and comparing two different types of lip pencils from MAC and NARS. They understand the differences between the products and provide detailed descriptions of their experience with each product. Additionally, they are open to trying new lip colors and exploring makeup options."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Choices:  - growing older - reproducing - shuddering - perspiration - palpitations  The rationale to choose \\"palpitations\\" as the answer is that: A:","output":"Palpitations can be indicative of potential health issues that may lead to a decreased lifespan if left untreated or unmanaged. While growing older is an inevitable part of life, and reproducing, shuddering, and perspiration are natural bodily functions that do not inherently signal a shortened life expectancy, palpitations are abnormal or irregular heartbeats that may be experienced as a fluttering, pounding, or racing sensation in the chest. They can be caused by several factors, including: 1. Heart conditions: Problems such as arrhythmias, heart valve disorders, or heart failure can lead to palpitations and potentially serious health consequences if not addressed. 2. Medical conditions: Palpitations may result from issues unrelated to the heart, such as thyroid disorders, low blood sugar, or dehydration. Some of these conditions left untreated can be life-threatening over time. 3. Stimulants and medications: Caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, and certain drugs can trigger palpitations. The misuse or overconsumption of such substances may contribute to a decreased lifespan. 4. Anxiety and stress: Prolonged stress can cause a strain on the heart and overall health, resulting in palpitations and an increased risk of developing more severe health issues. Although palpitations can be benign and may not necessarily indicate a life-threatening problem, they can also be a symptom of a serious underlying condition that requires medical attention. It is important to consult a healthcare professional if you experience frequent or severe palpitations, as addressing any potential health concerns early on can help prevent more serious complications and potentially extend your lifespan. In summary, while growing older is a natural aspect of life and not a sign of impending death in itself, palpitations could signify an underlying health condition or lifestyle factor that, if not addressed, may shorten your life expectancy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Roman architecture often incorporated the use of columns to support and embellish buildings, displaying stability, grandeur, and a sense of aesthetics. The other options listed do not represent types of buildings or might have columns but are not inherently known for their use of columns as a signature architectural component. - Whitehouse: The Whitehouse does have columns, but it's primarily known as the residence and workplace of the President of the United States, not for its use of columns as a defining architectural feature. - Pantheon: The Pantheon is a specific building in Rome, known for its grand columns, but it falls under the wider category of Roman architecture since it's a Roman temple. - Spreadsheet: A spreadsheet is not a type of building, but rather a digital document used for organizing, analyzing and storing data in a grid of horizontal rows and vertical columns. - Greece: Ancient Greek architecture did extensively use columns; however, the question specifically asked about buildings and not architectural styles or regions. Roman architecture is generally recognized for its extensive use of columns, particularly in large public structures like temples, basilicas, and amphitheaters. These columns followed several design orders such as Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian, which they borrowed and adapted from the Greeks, adding their unique touch to create their Roman architectural identity.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the story that is loosely based on Torquato Tasso's epic poem Gerusalemme liberata? ?  Rinaldo (HWV 7) is an opera by George Frideric Handel, composed in 1711, and was the first Italian language opera written specifically for the London stage. The libretto was prepared by Giacomo Rossi from a scenario provided by Aaron Hill, and the work was first performed at the Queen's Theatre in London's Haymarket on 24 February 1711. The story of love, war and redemption, set at the time of the First Crusade, is loosely based on Torquato Tasso's epic poem Gerusalemme liberata (\\"Jerusalem Delivered\\"), and its staging involved many original and vivid effects. It was a great success with the public, despite negative reactions from literary critics hostile to the contemporary trend towards Italian entertainment in English theatres. Handel composed Rinaldo quickly, borrowing and adapting music from operas and other works that he had composed during a long stay in Italy in the years 1706–10, during which he established a considerable reputation. In the years following the premiere, he made numerous amendments to the score. Rinaldo is regarded by critics as one of Handel's greatest operas. Of its individual numbers, the soprano aria \\"Lascia ch'io pianga\\" has become a particular favourite, and is a popular concert piece. Handel went on to dominate opera in England for several decades. Rinaldo was revived in London regularly up to 1717, and in a revised version in 1731; of all Handel's operas, Rinaldo was the most frequently performed during his lifetime. After 1731, however, the opera was not staged for more than 200 years. Renewed interest in baroque opera during the 20th century led to the first modern professional production in Handel's birthplace, Halle, Germany, in 1954. The opera was mounted sporadically over the following thirty years; after a successful run at New York's Metropolitan Opera in 1984, performances and recordings of the work have become more frequent worldwide. Rinaldo was the first Handel Opera to have found its way to the Metropolitan. The opera's tercentenary in 2011 brought a modernized...

The blue / purple color in food is due primarily to their anthocyanins which are antioxidants   that are particularly heart healthy and may help support healthy blood pressure. Out of all the blue and purple foods available, blueberries are considered to have the highest antioxidant level. An analysis of the latest data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Study found that people who eat purple and blue fruits and vegetables are at a reduced risk for high blood pressure and are less likely to be overweight. A food and health expert says that blue and purple color foods can prevent blood mass formation, and they also lower the risk of cancer. Foods that contain blue and purple colors are: reddish eggplant (especially the skin), blueberries, blackberries, purple grapes, etc. Green We all know that we should eat green as green symbolizes nature.

Eakins referred to the painting as Swimming in 1885, and as The Swimmers in 1886. The title The Swimming Hole dates from 1917 (the year after Eakins died), when the work was so described by the artist's widow, Susan Macdowell Eakins. Four years later, she titled the work The Old Swimming Hole, in reference to the 1882 poem The Old Swimmin'-Hole; by James Whitcomb Riley. The Amon Carter Museum has since returned to Eakins' original title, Swimming.The painting shows Eakins and five friends or students bathing at Dove Lake, an artificial lake in Mill Creek outside Philadelphia. Each of the men is looking at the water, in the words of Martin A. Berger, \\"apparently lost in a contemplative moment\\". Eakins' precise rendering of the figures has enabled scholars to identify all those depicted in the work. They are (from left to right): Talcott Williams (1849–1928), Benjamin Fox (c. 1865 – c. 1900), J. Laurie Wallace (1864–1953), Jesse Godley (1862–1889), Harry the dog (Eakins' Irish Setter, c. 1880–90), George Reynolds (c. 1839–89), and Eakins himself. The rocky promontory on which several of the men rest is the foundation of the Mill Creek mill, which was razed in 1873. It is the only sign of civilization in the work—no shoes, clothes, or bath houses are visible. The foliage in the background provides a dark background against which the swimmers' skin tones contrast. The positioning of the bodies and their musculature refers to classical ideals of physical beauty and masculine camaraderie evocative of Greek art. The reclining figure is a paraphrase of the Dying Gaul, and is juxtaposed with the far less formal self-depiction by the artist. It is possible that Eakins was seeking to reconcile an ancient theme with a modern interpretation; the subject was contemporary, but the poses of some of the figures recall those of classical sculpture. One possible influence by a contemporary source was Scène d'été, painted in 1869 by Frédéric Bazille (1841–70). It is not unlikely that Eakins saw the painting at the Salon while...

Title: Skip this one Review: First I'd like to admit I stink at writing reviews. I know that however I wish to save you some time and money.I started watching this movie and simply couldn't stay focused due to the boring slow moving story. I stopped watching around 15 minutes in. I then started back up the next day as I paid for it and I was desperate to watch something. I made it to 45 minutes out of the 113 total and stopped again. It's slow moving, I don't care about the characters or have a need to find out what's going on. I suspect I'll try and finish it tomorrow, as I paid for it, but I suggest you skip this one unless you are really desperate to watch something. It's very very slow moving and the things that do happen are so far between with the filling being the characters just verbally stressing out over what happened. That would probably happen in real life but it doesn't make for good entertainment. Answer: Available options: I. No; II. Yes; The answer is:","output":"I.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person that had their contents auctioned on 6 May 1850?, using the article: Etty had planned for a burial in York Minster, but neglected to cover the necessary costs in his will. With Yorkshire local government in political and financial chaos in the wake of the bankruptcy of George Hudson, there was no political will to organise a public subscription or to waive the fees, and as a consequence Etty was buried in the churchyard of St Olave's Church, his local parish church. On 6 May 1850 the contents of his studio were auctioned, in a total of 1034 lots including around 900 paintings; some of these paintings were incomplete studies later completed by other artists to increase their value. In the years following his death Etty's work became highly collectable, his works fetching huge sums on resale. He continued to be regarded as a pornographer by some, with Charles Robert Leslie observing in 1850 \\"It cannot be doubted that the voluptuous treatment of his subjects, in very many instances, recommended them more powerfully than their admirable art; while we may fully believe that he himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds\\".Six months after William's death, Betsy Etty married chemist Stephen Binnington, a distant relation of the Etty family. She moved into his house in Haymarket, and some time after his death moved to 40 Edwardes Square, where she died in 1888 at the age of 87. While Etty did have admirers, the patchy quality of his later work meant that he never acquired the circle of imitators and students that could have led to him being seen as the founder of the English realist movement, now considered to have begun in 1848 with the formation of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais, two of the three founders of the Pre-Raphaelites, were heavily influenced by Etty's early works but recoiled from his later style.

After more than a year of effort, attorneys with Northwest Justice Project earlier this week told 25 families in a mobile home park here that they can keep their homes and no longer need to fear eviction. The East Wenatchee City Council has entered into an Interlocal Agreement with the Wenatchee Housing Authority authorizing the Authority to purchase and maintain the Mobile Park Plaza mobile home park. Located just north of the Wenatchee Valley Mall, the park had been threatened with closure for more than a year. \\"We cannot say enough about how relieved we are that this is over,\\" said Manuel Luna, one of the residents of Mobile Park Plaza. \\"We were afraid that no solution would be found, and that our families would have no place to go. We are very grateful for the help of our attorneys. Without them, we would not have saved our homes. We are also thankful for the help of the Housing Authority, the City Council and Mayor Steve Lacy.\\" Formerly owned by local businessman Dan Jennings, Mobile Park Plaza had been home to 45 low-income families, many of them Latino farm workers. In October 2000 Jennings gave the park residents notice of his intent to close the park effective November 30, 2001. While some park residents decided to move, others, including 25 families, organized an informal association to relocate or save their homes. Unable to afford private legal counsel, the families asked for help from legal services attorneys at the Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services. In the succeeding months, these attorneys worked with representatives of the Greater Wenatchee Housing Authority, the state Office of Community Development, Chelan County, the City of East Wenatchee, state legislators, Jennings and others to secure funding and find a solution. \\"There seemed to be a never-ending set of obstacles,\\" said Patrick Pleas, an attorney with Northwest Justice Project. \\"Mr. Jennings had financial considerations, the City had growth and economic development considerations, and the State and Housing Authority had their own concerns.

No While the suggested answer contains some accurate information, it does not provide a comprehensive and detailed response to the question \\"what caused WWI?\\" World War I, also known as the First World War, was a global war that occurred from 1914 to 1918. Multiple intertwined factors contributed to the outbreak of the conflict, including: 1. Militarism: The period leading up to the war saw a significant increase in military spending, technological advancements, and the development of strong armies and navies by many European powers. This arms race exacerbated tensions between nations and heightened the likelihood of war. 2. Alliances: The complex web of alliances between various nations across Europe made it difficult for diplomatic resolutions to be reached in the event of a conflict. The Triple Entente, an alliance between France, Russia, and Great Britain, and the Triple Alliance, an agreement between Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy, served as the framework for the two rival groups of countries during the war. 3. Imperialism: European powers were in fierce competition for control over territories and resources around the world, particularly in Africa, Asia, and the Balkans. This competition for influence and colonial possessions contributed to an atmosphere of rivalry and distrust. 4. Nationalism: Nationalist movements and aspirations for independence were growing in strength within the multiethnic empires of Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Russia. This fueled tensions within the empires and fed into the larger geopolitical rivalries. 5. Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand: The immediate catalyst for the war was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, by Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb nationalist, on June 28, 1914, in Sarajevo. This event escalated into a broader conflict due to the aforementioned factors and the subsequent declarations of war between the nations involved. In conclusion, while the suggested answer touches upon the rivalries between Austria-Hungary, Serbia, and Russia, it lacks sufficient detail and context to provide a comprehensive understanding of the causes of World War I.

The Etruscan civilization () is the modern name given to a powerful and wealthy civilization of ancient Italy in the area corresponding roughly to Tuscany, western Umbria and northern Lazio. As distinguished by its unique language, this civilization endured from before the time of the earliest Etruscan inscriptions (c. 700 BC) until its assimilation into the Roman Republic, beginning in the late 4th century BC with the Roman-Etruscan Wars. Culture that is identifiably Etruscan developed in Italy after about 800 BC, approximately over the range of the preceding Iron Age Villanovan culture. The latter gave way in the 7th century BC to a culture that was influenced by Ancient Greek culture. Etruscan expansion was focused both to the north beyond the Apennine Mountains and into Campania. Some small towns in the sixth century BC disappeared during this time, ostensibly consumed by greater, more powerful neighbours. However, it is certain that the political structure of the Etruscan culture was similar to, albeit more aristocratic than, Magna Graecia in the south. The mining and commerce of metal, especially copper and iron, led to an enrichment of the Etruscans and to the expansion of their influence in the Italian peninsula and the western Mediterranean Sea. Here, their interests collided with those of the Greeks, especially in the sixth century BC, when Phocaeans of Italy founded colonies along the coast of Sardinia, Spain and Corsica. This led the Etruscans to ally themselves with Carthage, whose interests also collided with the Greeks.  Around 540 BC, the Battle of Alalia led to a new distribution of power in the western Mediterranean. Though the battle had no clear winner, Carthage managed to expand its sphere of influence at the expense of the Greeks, and Etruria saw itself relegated to the northern Tyrrhenian Sea with full ownership of Corsica. From the first half of the 5th century BC, the new political situation meant the beginning of the Etruscan decline after losing their southern provinces. In 480 BC, Etruria's ally Carthage was defeated by a coalition of Magna Graecia cities led by Syracuse, Sicily. A few years later, in 474, Syracuse's tyrant Hiero defeated the Etruscans at the Battle of Cumae. Etruria's influence over the cities of Latium and Campania weakened, and the area was taken over by Romans and Samnites.  In the 4th century BC, Etruria saw a Gallic invasion end its influence over the Po Valley and the Adriatic coast. Meanwhile, Rome had started annexing Etruscan cities. This led to the loss of the northern Etruscan provinces. Etruria was conquered by Rome in the 3rd century BC. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What happens after the alliance against the greek?","output":"After the alliance against the Greeks, there was a battle called the Battle of Alalia around 540 BC. This battle led to a new distribution of power in the western Mediterranean. Carthage expanded its influence, and the Etruscans became limited to the northern Tyrrhenian Sea with full ownership of Corsica. This marked the beginning of the Etruscan decline as they started losing their southern provinces."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the question: Two nearby villages are experiencing earthquakes. Bow village gets a lot of earthquakes annually, while Arrow village gets only a few.  Which village experiences fewer rocks breaking?  Hint: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). The answer is:","output":"Arrow village experiences fewer rocks breaking. The given information mentions that Bow village gets a lot of earthquakes annually, while Arrow village gets only a few.

After he storms off, the boys take to the frail Cerina, who begins to weep that ever since she lost her beauty, Amos had threatened to leave. Both saddened and incensed, the Stooges offer Cerina their spare room in the back. Shemp, seeing this, hatches a plan to invent a \\"Fountain of Youth\\" to restore Cerina to her stunning beauty.

U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senator Lindsey Graham have joined a growing chorus of Republican leaders to disavow comments by presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump about the Mexican heritage of a judge in a class-action lawsuit against Trump University. Questioned Tuesday about Trump's comments, Ryan said \\"I regret those comments he made. Claiming a person can't do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of racism.\\" But he did not retract his endorsement of Trump, made last week, and he said he does not believe Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton is \\"the answer.\\" Ryan made his comments during an appearance at a women's shelter in Washington, D.C. In a New York Times interview, Graham, also a former presidential candidate, said Trump's remarks were \\"the most un-American thing from a politician since Joe McCarthy,\\" referring to the ultra-conservative senator of the 1950s who fueled fears of widespread communist subversion in the United States. Graham also suggested that Republicans who have endorsed Trump reconsider their choice. \\"If anybody was looking for an off-ramp, this is probably it,\\" he said. The backlash appears to be mounting against the candidate, who has repeatedly said he believes U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, because of his \\"Mexican heritage,\\" would not rule fairly in the case charging Trump with fraud.

Another issue I faced was slow performance. Despite the promises of a high-speed processor, the phone lags when running multiple apps simultaneously or when using more demanding applications.

The reason for choosing Rebecca as the central character is that her honest nature allows for the development of more authentic relationships around her, and she can potentially serve as a positive role model promoting honesty and trust in the story. Additionally, this can allow for more engaging plot points and conflicts arising from Rebecca's character. Story continuation: Rebecca is trusted by people a lot more than Samantha is because Rebecca is a truthful person.  In their small town, everyone knew each other's strengths and weaknesses. Rebecca was well-regarded for her honest nature and ability to always speak the truth. No matter how hard it was, she stood by her principles and maintained her integrity. This earned her the respect of her peers and the trust of the town's residents. On the other hand, Samantha struggled with her reputation as someone who was not as truthful. While she was known to be friendly, she often embellished stories or avoided the truth to protect her image or stay out of any trouble. As a result, Samantha's words carried less weight, and people had a harder time trusting her. One day, a new family moved into the town, and they needed some guidance and support settling in. The townsfolk recommended Rebecca to help them, which allowed her to form a connection and share the values of their community, among which honesty was held in high regard. Samantha began to reflect on her actions and realized that her dishonesty had caused her to miss out on the chance to build authentic relationships and create a sense of belonging. Observing Rebecca's example, Samantha decided to make an effort to change her ways and learn to be more honest and trustworthy. As time passed, Samantha's efforts to be truthful earned her the respect and trust of those around her, and she began to feel a greater sense of belonging. The townspeople were cautiously optimistic, noticing the transformation in her character. Together, Rebecca and Samantha led the community in promoting trust and honesty as pillars for creating strong connections and a supportive environment among the townspeople."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Six weeks after arriving in the United States, Hassan Abduraheem takes a seat in the back pew of Tar Wallet Baptist Church. Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan. Abduraheem says his work was spreading the gospel; the Sudanese government accused him of espionage, and he was detained along with two other pastors in December 2015. \\"The first day when they took us to the prison, they beat us,” he says softly.  Abduraheem was shifted from prison to prison. For five months, he wore the same clothes he was wearing when he was arrested. His eyes became damaged from the harsh prison light. Yet, despite constant interrogations, just two meals of beans a day and a tiny cell with barely enough room to sleep, he says the worst part of prison was not knowing.

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: How many songs by Frank Sinatra were on the 1956 album called Hall of Fame, CL2600? Context: Eventually the 12-inch (300 mm) 33 1⁄3 rpm LP prevailed as the predominant format for musical albums, and 10-inch LPs were no longer issued. The last Columbia Records reissue of any Frank Sinatra songs on a 10-inch LP record was an album called Hall of Fame, CL 2600, issued on October 26, 1956, containing six songs, one each by Tony Bennett, Rosemary Clooney, Johnnie Ray, Frank Sinatra, Doris Day, and Frankie Laine. The 10-inch LP however had a longer life in the United Kingdom, where important early British rock and roll albums such as Lonnie Donegan's Lonnie Donegan Showcase and Billy Fury's The Sound of Fury were released in that form. The 7-inch (175 mm) 45 rpm disc or \\"single\\" established a significant niche for shorter duration discs, typically containing one item on each side.

A major problem is his chief rival Grocer, whose effort to cartelize the hitman business puts him at potentially lethal odds with the unaffiliated Martin. Following a botched contract, Martin receives an invitation to his 10-year high school reunion in his hometown of Grosse Pointe, Michigan. Initially reluctant to attend, he is pressured into it by both his therapist, Dr. Oatman, and his secretary, Marcella. She books him a contract in Michigan that coincides with the reunion, ostensibly to smooth things over with the client whose contract was botched. Upon arriving in Grosse Pointe, Martin reconnects with his friend Paul and seeks out his high school sweetheart Debi Newberry, now a radio DJ, whom Martin had abandoned on prom night to enlist in the Army. When asked about his livelihood, Martin readily reveals that he is a professional killer, a response taken as a joke by everyone he meets. Meanwhile, Martin is being stalked by Felix LaPoubelle, who attempts to kill Martin in the convenience store that stands in place of his childhood home. He is also tailed by two National Security Agency agents who were tipped off to Martin's contract by Grocer. Despite these dangers, Martin remains distracted by his desire to make amends with Debi and fails to open the background dossier on his prospective target. At the reunion, Martin mingles with his former classmates, one of whom hands him her toddler. Martin then experiences an epiphany, recognizing that his recent disillusionment with his work and his amends with Debi signify an opportunity to change his life for good.

Combining live footage of Elbow's September 2009 live performance at Manchester Evening News Arena with an interview between Guy Garvey and presenter Melvyn Bragg, the first half of the documentary focused on Elbow's early career and attempts to get a record deal. The second half discussed songs from Asleep in the Back, Leaders of the Free World and The Seldom Seen Kid. The documentary also contained sequences of Craig Potter demonstrating Elbow's unusual recording techniques at Blueprint Studios, Mark Potter driving around Elbow's old neighbourhood in Bury, Greater Manchester, Pete Turner showing cameras around Manchester's Northern Quarter where the band played their first gigs as Elbow and sequences of Guy Garvey reading through old and new lyric books. Some of the lines Garvey recited became the lyrics to \\"Jesus Was a Rochdale Girl\\" and \\"High Ideals\\".  Elbow's fifth studio album, Build a Rocket Boys!, was released on 7 March 2011. Upon its release the album hit Number 2 in the UK album charts, the highest of any Elbow album to date. Build a Rocket Boys! also earned the band their third nomination for the Mercury Prize.

Question: Who does Warsaw notice trying to get his attention from the crowd? Movie plot title: 15 Minutes Movie plot: The film begins with Emil Slovak (Karel Roden) and Oleg Razgul (Oleg Taktarov) arriving in America. They were former criminals and, after getting out of prison, have come to the U.S. to claim their part of a bank heist in Russia (or somewhere in Czech Republic). Within minutes of arriving, Oleg steals a video camera from a Make-Your-Own-Movie establishment. They go to the run-down apartment of their old partner and demand their share. He doesn't have it so Emil stabs him and his wife to death as Oleg tapes it with the camera. The couple's friend, Czech immigrant Daphne Handlova (Vera Farmiga), witnesses the murders from the bathroom; but she escapes before they can kill her, too. To hide the crime, Emil burns down the apartment. Jordy Warsaw (Edward Burns) is an arson investigator and is called to the case. Eddie Flemming (Robert De Niro) is a much celebrated detective who is also called to the scene. Flemming is such a high-profile celebrity detective that he is even followed around by the local tabloid TV show Top Story. Everywhere he goes, the townspeople cheer him on. Flemming and Warsaw decide to help each other out and work the case together. While checking out the crowd outside, Warsaw spots Daphne trying to get his attention. When he finally gets to where she was, she's gone. Emil calls an escort service from a business card he found in the girl's wallet and asks for a \\"Czech girl\\". When Honey (Noelle Evans), a regular call girl arrives, he kills her but not before getting the address of the escort service. Oleg tapes the murder. In fact, he tapes everything he can, trying to be the next Frank Capra. Flemming and Warsaw investigate her murder and also visit the escort service. Rose Hearn (Charlize Theron) runs the service and tells them that the girl they're looking for doesn't work for her but rather a local hairdresser. She also mentions a couple of other guys who just asked her the same questions. Flemming and Warsaw rush to the hairdresser, but they arrive just after Emil and Oleg warn Daphne to... A:","output":"In the film '15 Minutes,' Warsaw, played by Edward Burns, notices Daphne Handlova trying to get his attention from the crowd. Daphne Handlova, portrayed by Vera Farmiga, is a Czech immigrant who is pivotal to the storyline because she witnessed a murder committed by Emil Slovak and Oleg Razgul. She is an essential character in unraveling the truth behind the criminal activities of the duo - Emil and Oleg. After witnessing Emil stabbing their former partner and his wife to death, Daphne is marked as a target as well but manages to escape before they have a chance to kill her. Afraid for her life, she reaches out to Warsaw while he is checking out the crowd during his investigation of a crime scene, trying to bring the truth to light and probably seek his protection. When Warsaw spots Daphne in the crowd trying to get his attention, he tries to reach her to understand her urgency. However, by the time he arrives at her location, she has disappeared, enhancing the mysterious element in the plot line. This scene emphasizes not only the dangerous circumstances that Daphne is in but also highlights the dedicated character of Warsaw, an arson investigator working on this case. It also creates suspense as Daphne disappears before Warsaw can reach her, leaving the audience wondering what information she was trying to pass on and what might happen to her. Thus, by noticing Daphne in the crowd, Warsaw gets a clue about her existence and her potential connection to the crime he's investigating. This becomes an integral part of the plot's progression and connection to the case that he's working on."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Would the following sentence, by the strictest standards, be considered correct by a linguist? The writers did so believe the boy.","output":"To provide a detailed and comprehensive analysis of the given sentence, \\"The writers did so believe the boy,\\" first, we need to understand the basic components of a sentence, including word classes and their functions. The given sentence can be broken down into the following components: - \\"The writers\\" (noun phrase) is the subject of the sentence and represents the person or group of people performing the action conveyed by the verb. In this case, the noun phrase consists of a determiner \\"the\\" and a plural noun \\"writers.\\" - \\"did so believe\\" (verb phrase) is the predicate of the sentence which shows an action or a state of being. The predicate is composed of an auxiliary verb \\"did,\\" an adverb \\"so,\\" and the main verb \\"believe.\\"  - \\"the boy\\" (noun phrase) is the object of the sentence, which is the person or thing affected by the action of the verb. It also consists of a determiner \\"the\\" and a noun \\"boy.\\" At a first glance, the sentence may seem grammatically awkward due to the unusual word order and the presence of the adverb \\"so\\" after \\"did.\\" However, there are contexts and scenarios where this construction can be considered grammatically correct. In the sentence, \\"did so\\" is an example of a \\"do-support,\\" which is used with the adverb \\"so\\" for emphasis or to provide a contrast. If the context is such that the writers are being compared to another group of people who did not believe the boy, the sentence can make sense and be considered correct. For example: \\"Unlike the skeptics, the writers did so believe the boy.\\" If we ignore the context provided by \\"unlike the skeptics,\\" the given sentence might appear more ambiguous or difficult to understand. However, it follows the basic structure of an English sentence (subject-predicate-object), employs correct syntax, and can be considered grammatically accurate depending on the context. So, would a linguist consider the sentence \\"The writers did so believe the boy\\" as correct? When evaluated strictly, a linguist might argue that its correctness is largely contingent upon the context. If the context provides clear evidence of emphasis or contrast concerning the writers' beliefs, this sentence can indeed be considered linguistically correct."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The candidate is facing an almost unprecedented backlash from his own party, with some leading Republicans calling for him to step down as the nominee. A round-up of coverage: House Speaker Paul Ryan is one of scores of leading Republicans now trying to distance themselves from Trump, the Washington Post reports. He released a statement saying he is \\"sickened\\" by the comments—and Trump is no longer invited to a Wisconsin campaign event he was supposed to attend Saturday. CNN looks at how the old Access Hollywood tape made its way to the media at a very unfortunate time for Trump. Sources say a producer remembered the tape early in the week and, after digging it up mid-week, the show planned to air it Monday—but a copy made its way to the Washington Post first. CBS reports that Mike Pence has been refusing to answer reporters' questions about the tape. Reporters accompanying Pence were suddenly ushered out of a restaurant when the tape became public Friday. At a rally in Ohio that evening, Pence said that Trump emerges \\"still standing stronger than ever before\\" whenever he is targeted by the media. Republican fundraising chief Spencer Zwick tells the AP that he has been getting phone calls from donors who \\"want help putting money together to fund a new person to be the GOP nominee.\\" He says a write-in campaign \\"could actually work,\\" although some states don't allow write-in candidates. The Los Angeles Times reports that even Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who leads a pro-Trump super PAC and had his hands full dealing with Hurricane Matthew, found the time to denounce Trump's comments. \\"I'm not following politics closely right now, but this is terrible,\\" he said. \\"I don't agree with anyone talking like this about anyone, ever.\\" The New York Times takes a look at what it calls \\"the apology that wasn't.\\" Sources say Trump huddled with advisers, including daughter Ivanka, before issuing the brief—and defiant apology—late Friday.

As they are pursued by a dangerous crime lord who has his eyes set on the same inheritance, the estranged siblings are forced to put their differences aside, building a connection beyond wealth and power while overcoming their own personal demons. Act 1: Michael, a former car racer, leads an unfulfilling life as a car mechanic in a small desert town. He's estranged from his siblings, Tina - a successful businesswoman, Billy - a grad school dropout now working as a bartender, and Jamie - a passionate environmental activist, due to a family feud and toxic family history. One day, they receive a mysterious letter from their long-lost grandfather, a wealthy businessman who'd been assumed dead for years. He bequeaths them with his multi-million dollar fortune but the twist is that they must participate in a cross-country car race to claim it. The rules state that they must embark on the journey together within 24 hours of receiving the letter and face multiple challenges and checkpoints along the way. Act 2: Michael, Tina, Jamie, and Billy begrudgingly agree to participate in the race, united by their desire for wealth and new beginnings. They gather at their childhood home, where they find their weapon for the journey, a beautifully restored classic car in the garage. As they set out on their journey, they realize they're not the only ones interested in the inheritance. A dangerous crime lord, Victor Marcone, aware of their mission, wants the fortune for himself and sends his henchmen to intercept the siblings and claim the money. The henchmen chase the siblings in high-speed car battles, and the siblings must use their combined skills to stay ahead of the game. Along the way, Michael, Tina, Jamie, and Billy find themselves in various towns, where they confront memories of their childhood and the reasons behind their estrangement. Overcoming their differences, the siblings grow closer together, working as a team to tackle and overcome the challenges laid out by their grandfather. Act 3: As the siblings reach their final checkpoint, they learn that Marcone has kidnapped their mother and held her captive to ensure the siblings hand over the inheritance. Michael, with his racing skills, decides to put everything on the line in a final car chase against Marcone.

Conclusion: Having successfully claimed the inheritance and saved their mother, the siblings recognize that they've gained something even more valuable than the fortune - the rediscovery of family and unity. They realize that the race was their grandfather's way of bringing them back together. Michael decides to use his share of the inheritance to start a racing school for underprivileged kids, giving back to the community that built him. Tina, Jamie, and Billy also use their fortunes for good, fulfilling their lifelong dreams and making the world a better place.

However, when they are ingested, they can affect the body through a different route, which can eventually lead to their entrance into the bloodstream. When bacteria are ingested, they first encounter the harsh environment of the stomach, where stomach acid and other enzymes can kill or neutralize many bacteria. However, some bacteria can survive and move into the small intestine. Here, they can attach to the surface of the intestinal wall, multiplying and sometimes producing toxins or directly affecting the intestinal cells. Once the bacteria are established in the intestines, they can enter the bloodstream in various ways. This can happen when the bacteria directly invade the cells lining the intestines, when the bacteria release factors that cause the cells to break down, or when the bacteria stimulate an immune response, causing inflammation or damage to the intestinal lining. In all these cases, the bacteria have indirectly impacted the step of entering the bloodstream by first affecting the gastrointestinal system.

McCrea portrays Dr. Kildare in the character's first screen appearance. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer continued the Dr. Kildare series with \\"Young Dr. Kildare\\" (1938) starring Lew Ayres as Kildare and Laraine Day as a nurse in love with Kildare, similar to Stanwyck's role in this film. The film was released in the United Kingdom as \\"You Can't Take Money\\".  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - David Hoyt Canary (August 25, 1938  November 16, 2015) was an American actor, best known for his roles in \\"All My Children\\" and \\"Bonanza\\".  - A comic book or comicbook, also called comic magazine or simply comic, is a publication that consists of comic art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. Although some origins in 18th century Japan and 1830s Europe, comic books were first popularized in the United States during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, \\"Famous Funnies\\", was released in the United States in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term \\"comic book\\" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone.  - The police procedural, or police crime drama, is a subgenre of detective fiction that attempts to convincingly depict the activities of a police force as they investigate crimes. Although traditional detective novels usually concentrate on a single crime, police procedurals frequently depict investigations into several unrelated crimes in a single story. Traditional mysteries usually adhere to the convention of having the criminal's identity concealed until the climax (the so-called whodunit), whereas in police procedurals, the perpetrator's identity is often known to the audience from the outset (the inverted detective story). Police procedurals depict a number of police-related topics such as forensics, autopsies, the gathering of evidence, the use of search warrants, and interrogation.  - Rodman Edward \\"Rod\\" Serling (December 25, 1924  June 28, 1975) was an American screenwriter, playwright, television producer, and narrator known for his live television dramas of the 1950s and his science-fiction anthology TV series, \\"The Twilight Zone\\". Serling was active in politics, both on and off the screen, and helped form television industry standards. He was known as the \\"angry young man\\" of Hollywood, clashing with television executives and sponsors over a wide range of issues including censorship, racism, and war.  - Nevada (Spanish for \\"snowy\\"; see pronunciations) is a state in the Western, Mountain West, and Southwestern regions of the United States of America. Nevada is the 7th most extensive, the 34th most populous, and the 9th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Nearly three-quarters of Nevada's people live in Clark County, which contains the Las VegasParadise metropolitan area where three of the state's four largest incorporated cities are located. Nevada's capital is Carson City. Nevada is officially known as the \\"Silver State\\" because of the importance of silver to its history and economy. It is also known as the \\"Battle Born State\\", because it achieved statehood during the Civil War (the words \\"Battle Born\\" also appear on the state flag); as the \\"Sage-brush State\\", for the native plant of the same name; and as the \\"Sage-hen State\\". Nevada borders Oregon to the northwest, Idaho to the northeast, California to the west, Arizona to the southeast and Utah to the east.  - Television or TV is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound. It can refer to a television set, a television program (\\"TV show\\"), or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium, for entertainment, education, news, and advertising.  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources.

Please answer the following question: The government of prefix = st1 /Norwayis planning to build an unusual storage center on an island in the Arctic Ocean. The place would be large enough to hold about two million seeds. The goal is to present all crops known to scientists. The British magazine New Scientist published details of the plan last month. The structure will be designed to protect the world's food supply against nuclear war, climate change and other possible threats. It will be built in a mountain on the NorwegianislandofSpitsbergen. The mountain is less than one thousand kilometers from the North Pole, the northernmost position on earth. An international group called the Global Crop Diversity Trust is working on the project. The director of the group, Cary Fowler, spoke to New Scientist. He said the project would let the world rebuild agriculture if, in his word, \\"the worst came to the worst\\". Norwayis expected to start work next year. The project is expected to cost three million dollars. Workers will drill deep in the side of a sandstone mountain. Temperatures in the area never rise above 0oC. The seeds will be protected behind concrete walls a meter thick and high-security door. The magazine report says the collection will represent the products of ten thousand years of farming. Most of the seeds at first will come from collections at seed banks in Africa, Asia and Latin America. To last a long time, seeds need to be kept in very low temperatures. Workers will not be present all the time. But they plan to replace the air inside the storage space each winter. Winter temperatures on the island are about eighteen degrees below 0oC. The cold weather would protect the seeds even if the air could not be replaced. Mr. Fowler says the proposed structure will be the world's most secure gene bank.

Article: During the war, plans were drawn up to quell Welsh nationalism by affiliating Elizabeth more closely with Wales. Proposals, such as appointing her Constable of Caernarfon Castle or a patron of Urdd Gobaith Cymru (the Welsh League of Youth), were abandoned for various reasons, which included a fear of associating Elizabeth with conscientious objectors in the Urdd, at a time when Britain was at war. Welsh politicians suggested that she be made Princess of Wales on her 18th birthday. Home Secretary, Herbert Morrison supported the idea, but the King rejected it because he felt such a title belonged solely to the wife of a Prince of Wales and the Prince of Wales had always been the heir apparent. In 1946, she was inducted into the Welsh Gorsedd of Bards at the National Eisteddfod of Wales.

This decision was made after considering several important factors.  Step 1: Evaluate the Safety Features First, I compared the safety features of both vehicles. The SUV offers more comprehensive safety features such as advanced airbags, stability control, and better visibility due to its higher seating position. The sports car, while equipped with standard safety features, lacks many of the advanced options available in the SUV. Step 2: Research Crash Test Ratings After assessing the safety features, I dug into the crash test ratings of both vehicles. The SUV consistently scored higher in crash tests conducted by various safety organizations, indicating a higher level of protection in the event of a collision. The sports car performed adequately, but its ratings were not as impressive as the SUV's. Step 3: Consider Practicality Practicality played a significant role in my decision, as having a child requires extra space for things like strollers, diaper bags, and car seats. The SUV offers more cargo space and seating capacity, making it an ideal choice for a family. Step 4: Assess the Ease of Use To ensure that traveling with a child is as smooth and stress-free as possible, I evaluated the ease of use of both vehicles. The SUV's higher ground clearance made it easier to install and remove the car seat and load/unload the stroller, whereas the sports car's lower ground clearance proved to be more challenging. Step 5: Factor in Fuel Economy While fuel economy is generally not the top priority when considering safety, I still wanted to be conscientious of our family's overall fuel consumption. Surprisingly, many modern SUVs offer comparable fuel economy to certain sports cars, so deciding to drive the SUV more often did not drastically increase our fuel costs. After going through these steps, the choice was clear - the sports car simply did not meet the safety and practicality criteria necessary for our growing family. As a result, I've been driving the SUV more frequently, providing a sense of security knowing my son is in a safer vehicle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: can you suggest one application of sound waves in oceanography?? Answer:","output":"Yes, one application of sound waves in oceanography is in the use of Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs). Step 1: Identifying the need Oceanographers need to collect data on ocean currents for various reasons such as understanding environmental changes, monitoring climate patterns, and ensuring maritime safety. Step 2: Choosing the appropriate technology Since sound waves can travel long distances underwater with minimal energy loss, they are a suitable tool for probing ocean waters and measuring currents. Step 3: Implementing the technique ADCPs work by emitting sound waves at a specific frequency into the water. These sound waves then bounce off particles suspended in the water column, such as plankton or sediment particles. Step 4: Measuring the reflected sound waves Upon reflection, the sound waves experience a frequency shift due to the Doppler effect, which is related to the relative motion of the particles and the ADCP. The reflected sound waves are detected by the ADCP's transducers. Step 5: Analyzing the data By analyzing the returned sound waves' frequency shifts, oceanographers can determine the speed and direction of water particles at different depths, providing information about ocean current patterns at various levels. Step 6: Applying the information Through the use of ADCPs, oceanographers can gain a better understanding of ocean currents and their effects on weather, climate, and marine ecosystems. This information can also be used to improve maritime navigation, plan research operations, and address other ocean-related issues."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Tara Maclay is a fictional character created for the action-horror/fantasy television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997-2003). She was developed by Joss Whedon and portrayed by Amber Benson. Tara is a shy young woman with magical talents who falls in love with Willow Rosenberg, one of the core characters. Together, they help Buffy Summers, who has been given superhuman powers to defeat evil forces in the fictional town of Sunnydale. When Tara and Willow meet, their proficiency at magic is about the same, but Tara's knowledge of the craft far exceeds Willow's. Tara reveals that she has been practicing magic for most of her life, as her deceased mother had also been a powerful witch. Throughout season 4, Tara acts as a partner and guide in Willow's witchcraft, teaching Willow spells and performing magic together. Willow, however, is inherently talented, despite being new to the craft, and begins to progress much faster than Tara in the fifth season, including experimentations in dark magic. Tara struggles with understanding her place among the Scoobies with Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar), the leader, with which has a very friendly relationship; Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendon), Willow's friend since childhood; and Rupert Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), their mentor. Tara's primary role throughout the series is that of Willow's partner. She feels somewhat useless until the fifth season episode \\"Family\\" when the entire Scooby Gang (Spike included) makes it clear that she is unquestionably a part of them. The episode introduces some of Tara's blood family: a cold, authoritarian father who has lied to her all her life (telling her that her magical powers are a result of her being part-demon on her mother's side); an overbearing brother; and a judgmental, repressed and repressive cousin; all of whom Tara dismisses at the end of the episode. Tara later reveals in \\"The Body\\" that her mother had died when she was 17. In the following episode, when Dawn is acting out, Tara confides to Buffy that she had to deal with her brother after her mother's death. No more of her backstory is revealed in the series.  As Willow's character grows more self-assured and powerful through the seasons, Tara takes over some of the role of being placed in peril and needing to be rescued. The fifth season's primary villain, or Big Bad, is Glory, a goddess too powerful for Buffy to fight alone. Glory tortures Tara in order to gain information on the Key, but Tara asserts willpower and resists Glory, resulting in Glory stealing her sanity, and prompting Willow to go searching for retribution. Glory states she feels \\"buzzed\\" after feeding on Tara's mind, indicating Tara's powerful intellect (and possibly suggesting her power as a witch).  Buffy scholar Ian Shuttleworth writes that Benson was able to \\"admirably\\" portray the same range of emotions inherent in Tara although the character loses her identity. Willow's powers are significant enough that she is able to battle Glory more effectively than Buffy, if not completely successfully. In the final episode of season 5, Willow uses her magic to restore Tara's sanity, significantly weakening Glory in the process.  Tara also becomes a guide of sorts, and a maternal figure. She appears to Buffy in a dream in the fourth season finale \\"Restless\\" to tell her about the arrival of Buffy's sister Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) and act as a translator for the voiceless First Slayer. Following the death of Joyce Summers and Buffy's sacrifice to save the world at the end of the fifth season, Tara and Willow move into the Summers house, taking Joyce's bedroom and becoming Dawn's surrogate parents.","output":"This text is about Tara Maclay, a fictional character from the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Carmen, known for her endless wisdom, love for the sea, and captivating storytelling, has left an indelible mark on everyone she met. Among the mourners is Pedro, a talented but aloof writer, who shares an unspoken bond with Carmen's grandson, Bernardo. As the story unfolds, we learn that Pedro and Bernardo, once inseparable childhood friends, have drifted apart over the years. Their friendship was a casualty of time and circumstance, and the bustling city life that swallowed Bernardo whole after moving away. But the death of Bernardo's grandmother, Carmen, draws Bernardo back to the small town he left years ago, reigniting his relationship with Pedro and reviving memories of their shared past. Pedro struggles with his own hidden feelings for Bernardo, but is hesitant to express his lament and condolences. He tries to focus on his writing, immersing himself in a fictional world of romance where the unspoken is alluded to but never actualized. But as Pedro delves into the pages of his writing, he begins to understand that the emotions hidden between the lines are a mirror, reflecting his own secret longing for Bernardo. Bernardo, now a successful businessman in the city, recognizes that his life lacks the depth and connection he once had with Pedro. This realization draws him closer to his roots, the sea, and the small town he left behind to chase his dreams. Despite all the material success, he feels an emptiness in his heart, only amplified by the passing of his grandmother. Fate brings Pedro and Bernardo together as they spend time reconnecting with their shared memories and exploring their once-forgotten bond. Pedro, inspired by the memory of Abuela Carmen, finally musters the courage to express his lament for Carmen's passing and his true feelings for Bernardo. This heartfelt revelation leads to an emotional climax in which the two rediscover their buried love and make a promise to embrace the moment and never let go again. The movie concludes with Pedro and Bernardo walking hand in hand on the beach, the waves gently lapping at the shore, as the sea that once separated them now serves as a beautiful reminder of their enduring love and the powerful connections that bind them all together. Echoes of Love is a poignant, bittersweet tale of love, loss, and the transformative power of human connections, all set against the backdrop of a charming seaside town. This heartfelt movie transcends traditional boundaries and serves as a reminder that true love knows no limits and has the power to withstand the passage of time."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Q:I read this background article the other day: Soon after the original study was published, other researchers tried to replicate the research. However, it could not be replicated. No other studies could find a link between the vaccine and autism. As a result, scientists became convinced that the original results were incorrect. Eventually, investigators determined that the original study was a fraud. They learned that its author had received a large amount of money to find evidence that the vaccine causes autism, so he faked his research results.

The tweet is directed towards user @hummingbird604 and discusses the author's experience with their former exhibition industry career, which results in them having free passes to a majority of films and having to take people along as a consequence. The sentiment of this tweet can be described as a mix of casual, positive, and slightly boastful. Let's analyze why this is the case: 1. Casual: The style of the tweet is conversational and employs colloquial language, such as \\"yea,\\" \\"b/c\\" (because), \\"peeps\\" (people) and the use of the ellipsis. This informal style creates a relaxed, casual tone, suggesting the author is not being particularly serious or formal. 2. Positive: The mention of free passes to most films is generally considered a good thing, as it highlights an advantage that the author has experienced due to their previous career. The tweet also has an underlying sense of gratitude for these perks, despite having to take people along. The use of \\"end up having 2 take peeps\\" implies some level of enjoyment in sharing this perk with others, which contributes to the positive tone. 3. Slightly boastful: Although the overall sentiment is positive, the author's statement about their free access to movies might come across as slightly boastful. This is because the author indirectly implies their access to exclusive benefits that others may not have. While this is not necessarily negative, the author sounds proud of their previous career and might seem to be subtly bragging about their ability to watch movies for free. In summary, the sentiment of this tweet can be described as casually positive, with the author both celebrating and mildly boasting about their perks because of their former exhibition industry career.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Gallagher was born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal in 1948. His father Daniel was employed by the Irish Electricity Supply Board, who were constructing Cathaleen's Fall hydroelectric power station on the Erne River above the town. The family moved, first to Derry City, where his younger brother Donal was born in 1949. His mother, Monica, and the two boys then moved to Cork, where the brothers were raised. Gallagher played a worn sunburst 1961 Stratocaster (Serial Number 64351) for some years. It was reputedly the first in Ireland,and was ordered from Fender by Jim Connolly, a member of The Irish Showband. In 1961, Connolly ordered a cherry red Stratocaster through Crowley's music shop of Cork's McCurtain Street. When Fender shipped a sunburst Stratocaster instead, it was put up on sale in 1963 as a second-hand instrument, which Gallagher bought in August 1963 for just under PS100. Speaking about Gallagher's purchase, his brother Donal recalled: \\"His dream ambition was to have a guitar like Buddy Holly... This Stratocaster was in the store as a used instrument, it was 100 pounds... in today's money you couldn't even compare you might as well say it was a million pounds... my mother was saying we'll be in debt for the rest of our lives and Rory said well actually with a guitar like this I can play both parts, rhythm and lead, we won't need a rhythm player so I can earn more money and pay it off so the Stratocaster became his partner for life if you like.\\"  The guitar was extensively modified by Gallagher. The tuning pegs and the nut were replaced, the latter interchanged a number of times. The pickguard was also changed during Gallagher's time with Taste. Only the middle pick-up is original. The final modification was the wiring: Gallagher disconnected the bottom tone pot and rewired it so he had just a master tone control along with the master volume control. He installed a 5-way selector switch in place of the vintage 3-way one.  Most of the paint was removed from the guitar in 1967 or 1968 during the Taste period, as evidenced from contemporary photographs. Although the Strat was left abandoned in a rainy ditch for days after being stolen from the back of a tour van in Dublin, this is not believed to have caused any ill effect. A borrowed Telecaster was also stolen at the same time but never recovered. When the Strat was recovered two weeks later, Gallagher swore he would never sell it or paint it. The paint removal and appearance of extensive road wear was in keeping with Gallaghers public persona and image.  It also had a period of time of having a replacement neck, with the original neck bowing due to the amount of moisture it absorbed during continuous touring. The neck was taken off and left to settle, and was eventually reunited with the Strat after returning to its correct shape. Other quirks include a 'hump' in the scratch plate which moves the neck pick-up closer to the neck on the bass side, and a replacement of all of the pick-ups, though this replacement was due to damage rather than the perception of a tonal inadequacy. One final point of interest is that one of the clay double-dot inlays at the 12th fret fell out and was replaced with a plastic one, which is why it is whiter than the other clay inlays. On 21 and 22 October 2011, Rory's brother Donal brought the guitar out of retirement to allow Joe Bonamassa to perform with it on his two nights at the London Hammersmith Apollo. Bonamassa opened both night's performances with his rendition of \\"Cradle Rock\\" using Gallagher's Stratocaster. What is a stratocaster?","output":"A Stratocaster is a type of electric guitar, specifically a model designed by the Fender company. It is known for its distinctively contoured body shape, double-cutaway design, and three single-coil pickups. In the article, it mentions that Gallagher played a worn sunburst 1961 Stratocaster (Serial Number 64351) for some years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Crowe recognizes him as Vincent Grey, a former patient whom he treated as a child for hallucinations. Vincent shoots his former doctor before killing himself. The next fall, Crowe begins working with another patient, 9-year-old Cole Sear, whose case is similar to Vincent's. Crowe becomes dedicated to the boy, though he is haunted by doubts over his ability to help him after his failure with Vincent. Meanwhile, he and his wife seldom, if ever, speak or do anything together. Crowe feels he must help Cole in order to rectify his failure to help Vincent and reconcile with his wife. Cole's mother, Lynn, who truly loves him, worries about his social stamina, especially after seeing signs of physical abuse. Cole eventually confides his secret to Crowe: he sees ghosts, who walk around like the living unaware they are dead. At first, Crowe thinks Cole is delusional and considers dropping his case. Remembering Vincent, the psychologist listens to an audiotape from a session with Vincent when he was a child. On the tape, when Crowe leaves the room, and then returns, Vincent was crying. Turning up the volume, Crowe hears a weeping man begging for help in Spanish, and now believes that Cole is telling the truth and that Vincent may have had the same ability. He suggests to Cole that he should try to find a purpose for his gift by communicating with the ghosts and perhaps aid them with their unfinished business. At first, Cole is unwilling since the ghosts terrify and sometimes even threaten him, but he finally decides to do it. Cole talks to one of the ghosts, Kyra Collins, a young girl who recently died after a chronic illness. He goes with Crowe to her funeral reception at her home, where Kyra directs...

Choices:  - wet soil - start to fall - dry soil - wet things - wet ground  The rationale to choose \\"wet soil\\" as the answer is that: The answer to this question is:","output":"Worms are crawling out of the earth in the middle of rain because of wet soil. The rationale behind choosing \\"wet soil\\" as the answer is threefold: 1. Oxygen availability: Worms breathe through their skin, and when the soil gets saturated with rainwater, there is a reduced availability of oxygen. To ensure sufficient oxygen supply and avoid suffocation, worms move up and out of the wet soil. 2. Ease of movement: Wet soil is softer and more manageable, making it easier for worms to navigate through the earth. Rainwater helps to lubricate the soil particles and reduces the friction that hinders worms' movement when the soil is dry. This provides an excellent opportunity for worms to move to new areas, find food, and escape predators. 3. Mating opportunities: Earthworms may come to the surface during heavy rainfall for mating purposes. The wet conditions create a favorable environment for worms to release their mucus-coated cocoons containing eggs and sperm. This allows fertilization to occur when the worms come in contact with each other. In summary, the primary reason worms crawl out of the earth during rain is the wet soil, which makes it easier for them to move, breathe, and reproduce."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: Which astronaut, part of the Apollo 12 mission on November 19th 1969 became the 4th person to walk on the moon after Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Pete Conrad ?","output":"On November 19th, 1969, during the Apollo 12 mission, Alan L. Bean became the fourth person to walk on the moon after Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Apollo 12 Commander Charles \\"Pete\\" Conrad. Born on March 15, 1932, in Wheeler, Texas, Alan LaVern Bean was an accomplished astronaut, aeronautical engineer, and painter. Before his well-known lunar excursion, Bean graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 1955 with a degree in Aeronautical Engineering. He subsequently joined the Navy, where he became a test pilot and completed a tour as a fighter pilot. His impressive background and expertise caught the attention of NASA, which selected him in 1963 as part of their third astronaut group. Bean's historic Apollo 12 mission was his first spaceflight. Apollo 12 was the sixth manned flight in the Apollo program and the second to land on the moon. Alongside mission Commander Pete Conrad, Bean piloted the Lunar Module \\"Intrepid\\" to the moon's surface, more specifically, to the Ocean of Storms region. Their journey took place just over four months after Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin first stepped on the lunar surface as part of Apollo 11. While on the moon, Bean and Conrad conducted two extravehicular activities (EVAs), collectively totaling over eight hours. During their time outside the lunar module, they were able to collect 75 pounds (34 kg) of lunar samples, including rocks and soil. They also deployed various scientific instruments like the solar wind spectrometer and the lunar seismometer. One memorable moment from their mission was when Alan Bean inadvertently pointed a color television camera lens at the sun, destroying the camera’s ability to relay live images of their activities back to Earth. In addition to his role in the Apollo 12 mission, Alan Bean was the spacecraft commander for Skylab 3, which was the second manned mission to the Skylab space station in 1973. Along with fellow crew members Jack R. Lousma and Owen K. Garriott, Bean conducted numerous scientific experiments and spent 59 days in orbit. Bean retired from NASA in 1981 and pursued a career as an artist, focusing on the varied experiences he and other astronauts had during their space missions. His paintings often depicted the lunar surface, the Apollo spacecraft, and astronauts conducting tasks in the unique lunar environment. Alan Bean passed away on May 26, 2018, at the age of 86. His contributions to the space program, both as an astronaut and as an artist, have left a lasting legacy and provided invaluable insights into the Apollo missions and the moon's surface. His role as the fourth person to walk on the moon solidified Bean's place in history and inspired future generations to explore the cosmos."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The former Saturday Kitchen host vowed to investigate \\"personally\\" after Ewen Cameron shared an image of the dish with his Twitter followers.

Ewen explained: \\"When we went in I noticed the price of the burgers was £9.50 plus and you were not getting chips with that or onion rings or a side salad - just a burger on its own.      \\"I said to my wife 'I'm not spending £10 on a burger'.\\"      While Ewen went to newsagent WH Smith for a \\"meal deal\\" his wife ordered a burger from the restaurant.      \\"When I got back 10 to 15 minutes later my wife was sat looking at the burger,\\" he said.      The DJ admitted that his wife had told the staff not to put lettuce on the burger, which contributed to it looking less appetising, but he was still disappointed by the meal.      \\"What they served was the flattest of burgers, which was burnt round the edges, a huge roll that was quite stale and not fresh, with some cheese and onions in the middle.      \\"It was just poor quality. For £9.50 I was absolutely gobsmacked.\\"      Ewen says he often finds airport food disappointing.      He said: \\"It is a problem at airports around the country. It is overpriced and it is never as good as you expect it to be. I don't think it is just a James Martin problem.\\"      A statement from Glasgow Airport: \\"We were sorry to hear of Mr Cameron's recent experience while dining in James Martin Kitchen.      \\"The images shared certainly don't reflect the high standards we expect to deliver and it was reassuring to see Mr Martin respond personally to the feedback received.      \\"Our retail team is working closely with staff from James Martin Kitchen to ensure our passengers continue to enjoy the quality products and customer experience they rightly deserve.\\" ||||| What is a summary?","output":"TV chef James Martin has assured a customer that he will personally investigate a complaint about an unsatisfactory burger served in his restaurant at Glasgow airport, the James Martin Kitchen.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question. Questions: Where would a cat sit to soak up sunlight? Options: - barn - house - window sill - humane society - comfortable chair","output":"The option most in line with common sense when answering the question, \\"Where would a cat sit to soak up sunlight?\\" is the window sill. A detailed explanation follows: 1. Window sill: This is the perfect place for a cat to sit and soak up sunlight. Cats are known to enjoy sunbathing, and window sills offer an elevated, narrow space where cats can perch, as they enjoy being off the ground. Window sills provide direct access to sunlight and warmth, which cats find very comfortable. Additionally, these spaces frequently provide a nice view of the outdoors, offering entertainment in the form of watching birds, squirrels, or other critters that may pass by. While the other options have their own merits, they do not offer the same level of comfort, exposure to sunlight, or sense of safety as a window sill: 2. Barn: A barn may offer some sunlight if there are windows or open doors, but it is not specifically designed with the intention of letting in sunlight for cats to enjoy. Cats may find the environment unfamiliar, and it might be harder for them to find a comfortable, safe place to rest and soak up the sun. 3. House: A house, in general, could have many spots where sunlight comes in, such as near windows, sliding doors, or skylights. Nevertheless, it is not a specific location where a cat would naturally gravitate to soak up sunlight. Plus, the option is too broad and could include areas where a cat might not enjoy the sun. 4. Humane society: This location refers to an animal shelter or adoption center. While cats living in a humane society might get some sunlight through windows or outdoor enclosures, it is not a place inherently designed for cats to soak up sunlight. It is mainly a temporary holding place where they await new homes. 5. Comfortable chair: A comfortable chair might be appealing if it is placed near a window with sunlight streaming in. However, it is not the primary focus when it comes to cats soaking up sunlight. Chairs may not always be located near sources of sunlight or offer the elevation and narrow space that cats typically prefer for resting. In summary, a window sill provides the best combination of direct sunlight, elevation, warmth, and safety that cats prefer when choosing a spot to soak up sunlight."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: I showed up at the address on Columbine's invitation just before eleven; it was a converted warehouse in an industrial zone on the city's north side. Since it was a Saturday night, everything else was empty for miles. The parking lot was filled with sports cars, hybrids, and shiny suburban tanks. The door facing the parking lot was open, spilling out muted lights and the din of yuppie chatter. It cast a somewhat foreboding aura over the entrance. The first thing I noticed as I approached was the beefy refrigerator in a rented tux blocking the doorway. The second thing was the surveillance camera perched on the wall above his head. I had stopped home and changed first, so I was sure I was dressed mostly appropriately for some rich faux-hipster art party - charcoal gray pinstripe jacket over a TV on the Radio t-shirt, skinny cuffed jeans, Docs, and a black fedora. I certainly didn't look any worse than the other idiots I saw filing in and out of the door. I even had an invitation. So I was fairly confident I'd be able to gain admission to this thing without incident. \\"No, absolutely not,\\" the doorman said, pressing a meaty palm into my chest. \\"I was invited!\\" I said, exasperated. \\"I have documentation.\\" I waved the rave card in front of his face. \\"No dice.\\" I stepped aside to let a couple of aging goths through the door and wondered for a moment if the doorman somehow knew who I was. Then I noticed the ear piece he was wearing and my eyes darted back to the surveillance camera. \\"Motherfucker,\\" I spat and raised both arms to flip off the camera. I didn't know it at the time, but at that moment Dylan Maxwell was sitting in front of a wall of monitors, laughing his ass off. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why did the narrator try to flip off the camera? Options:  A.

I live in the land of Disney, Hollywood. You may think people in such an attractive and exciting, fun-filled place are happier than others. If so, you have some mistaken ideas about the nature of happiness. Many intelligent people still consider happiness equal to fun. The truth is that fun and happiness have little or nothing in common. Fun is what we experience during an act. Happiness is what we experience after an act. It is a deeper, more lasting emotion. Going to an amusement park or ball game, watching a movie or television, are fun activities that help us relax, temporarily forget our problems and maybe even laugh. But they do not bring happiness, because their positive effects end when the fun ends. I have often thought that if Hollywood stars have a role to play, it is to teach us that happiness has nothing to do with fun. These rich, beautiful people have constant access to glamorous parties, fancy cars, expensive homes, everything that brings \\"happiness\\". But in memoir after memoir, famous people expose the unhappiness hidden beneath all their fun -- depression, alcoholism, drug addiction, broken marriages, troubled children and extreme loneliness. Ask an unmarried man why he refuses to get married even though he finds dating to be less and less satisfying. If he's honest, he will tell you that he is afraid of making a commitment. For commitment is in fact quite painful. The single life is filled with fun, adventure and excitement. Marriage has such moments, but they are not its most distinguishing features. Similarly, couples that choose not to have children are deciding in favor of painless fun over painful happiness. They can dine out whenever they want and sleep as late as they want. Couples with babies are lucky to get a whole night's sleep or a three-day vacation. I don't know any parent who would choose the word fun to describe raising children. The way people stick to the belief that a fun-filled, pain-free life equals happiness actually reduces their chances of ever achieving real... In the writer's opinion, marriage   _  . A) means the end of fun B) leads to less sleep C) leads to raising children D) means responsibility Answer:","output":"The writer's opinion suggests that marriage \\"D) means responsibility\\". Marriage is described as a commitment which can involve pain, sacrifice and is not always fun. With marriage, couples could face responsibilities such as raising children which can lead to less sleep and less personal freedom, but it provides a deeper, more lasting form of happiness than mere fun or excitement. It's a deeper sense of fulfillment and satisfaction that comes with shared experiences, challenges, and achievements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This negatively impacts plant growth, causing the weakening or death of trees and other vegetation, and can contribute to forest decline. As trees and plants suffer from the effects of acid rain, the ecosystems they support also suffer. The death of aquatic life due to acidic water disrupts the food chain, affecting organisms at various trophic levels, and reducing biodiversity. Terrestrial animals that depend on the plants and trees for food, shelter, and habitat will also be impacted by the decline in forest health caused by acid rain. As a result, entire ecosystems can become compromised, causing a ripple effect that reaches far beyond the immediate plants and animals directly affected by acid rain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If \\"The formally-dressed man smiles upwards as he does a split.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A man in classy clothes performs a split at a wedding\\"?","output":"No, it does not logically follow that \\"A man in classy clothes performs a split at a wedding\\" solely based on the information provided in the statement \\"The formally-dressed man smiles upwards as he does a split.\\" The reason for this is that the initial statement does not provide any specific information or context that implies that the event where the split is being performed is a wedding. The original statement provides us with the following information: 1. The man is formally dressed: This information indicates that the man is wearing clothes that are appropriate for formal occasions. This could include events such as weddings, sophisticated parties, business meetings, or any other events with a formal dress code. However, we cannot deduce that this specific event is a wedding based on this information alone. 2. The man is smiling upwards: The man's facial expression and direction imply that he is feeling joy, happiness, or satisfaction as he performs the split. However, this information does not necessarily link his behavior to a wedding. There could be various reasons for the man to express happiness while doing a split during a formal occasion, but we cannot ascertain any particular reason with the current data. 3. The man performs a split: Lastly, the man is executing a split - a challenging and often attention-grabbing move. This part of the statement also does not provide any direct connection to a wedding. In conclusion, the statement \\"The formally-dressed man smiles upwards as he does a split.\\" does not logically imply that \\"A man in classy clothes performs a split at a wedding.\\" Although it is plausible that the event might be a wedding, there is not enough information or context provided to confirm this assumption. The man's formal attire, his joyful expression, and the fact that he is doing a split could suggest an event with a formal dress code and a festive atmosphere, but there is no definitive link to a wedding."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What was going on in Eastern Europe? Context: The geographical regions in which Iranian languages were spoken were pushed back in several areas by newly neighbouring languages. Arabic spread into some parts of Western Iran (Khuzestan), and Turkic languages spread through much of Central Asia, displacing various Iranian languages such as Sogdian and Bactrian in parts of what is today Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. In Eastern Europe, mostly comprising the territory of modern-day Ukraine, southern European Russia, and parts of the Balkans, the core region of the native Scythians, Sarmatians, and Alans had been decisively been taken over as a result of absorption and assimilation (e.g. Slavicisation) by the various Proto-Slavic population of the region, by the 6th century AD. This resulted in the displacement and extinction of the once predominant Scythian languages of the region. Sogdian's close relative Yaghnobi barely survives in a small area of the Zarafshan valley east of Samarkand, and Saka as Ossetic in the Caucasus, which is the sole remnant of the once predominant Scythian languages in Eastern Europe proper and large parts of the North Caucasus. Various small Iranian languages in the Pamirs survive that are derived from Eastern Iranian. The answer to this question is:","output":"In Eastern Europe, specifically in areas of modern-day Ukraine, southern European Russia, and parts of the Balkans, the native Scythians, Sarmatians, and Alans had been significantly absorbed and assimilated (e.g. Slavicisation) by the various Proto-Slavic populations by the 6th century AD.

[-] yes. [-] it is not possible to tell. [-] no.","output":"It is not possible to tell if the car was from the north based solely on the information provided. While it is true that cars in colder climates (such as the northern regions) may be less reliant on air conditioning, there are several other factors to consider. 1. The age of the car: Older cars may not have air conditioning, regardless of their geographical origin. Automotive air conditioning systems started to become more popular during the 1960s, but they were not a standard feature in all vehicles until later years. 2. The make and model of the car: Cars vary in their features, and not all cars are equipped with air conditioning. Some low-cost or basic models may omit air conditioning to make them more affordable. 3. Owner preference: The original owner of the car may have chosen not to have air conditioning installed due to personal preference, regardless of the location. 4. Cost of installation and maintenance: Installing and maintaining an air conditioning system can be expensive. For some car owners, especially those in a tight budget, the expense may not be worth the potential benefit. 5. Climate change: The need for air conditioning in cars has increased over the years as global temperatures have risen. A car from a currently colder northern region may not have needed air conditioning in the past when temperatures were cooler. 6. Cultural factors: Some individuals or communities may not prioritize air conditioning in their cars due to a cultural preference for fresh air and natural ventilation. Given these factors, it would be a hasty generalization to conclude that the car is from the north based only on the lack of air conditioning. More information about the car itself, as well as the preferences and circumstances of the original owner would be required in order to make a more informed judgment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person Shelly paid to seduce Lootz?, using the article: Unlucky Bernie Lootz has little positive going for him: he lives in a dreary place—a  studio apartment in a run-down motel  near the Las Vegas Strip; he can't recall the last time he had physical contact with a woman; he's indebted to the Shangri-La casino boss Shelly Kaplow, who years earlier cured him of a gambling habit by breaking his kneecap. Kaplow had also paid Lootz's casino debts, and Bernie has been working off that large debt to Shelly for several years and the debt is nearly paid off. Lootz is weary of the casino business, and tells Kaplow he is leaving Las Vegas soon. His future success as a luck \\"cooler\\" is changed when cocktail waitress Natalie Belisario seemingly takes an interest in him, and his luck—and that of those around him—takes a turn for the better. What Bernie doesn't know yet is that Shelly has paid Natalie to seduce him into staying and working at the Shangri-La. What Shelly doesn't know is that Natalie actually has fallen in love with Bernie, and vice versa. Additional complications arise when Shelly, a relative old-timer who resents the Disneyfication of Vegas, resists the efforts of new Shangri-La owner advisers, including Ivy League graduate and condescending upstart Larry Sokolov, to update the casino hotel property and bring it into the 21st century. Lootz also learns his seldom-seen adult son is back in town, and, with his wife, is interfering with the operations at the Shangri-La.

News article: The matchmaking app for people who want to make friends not love ‘Wiith’, a new San Francisco-based app, is designed to buddy you up with people looking for buddies. And that's it. No romance, no sex, just pure, unadulterated friendship. Think of it as a Tinder for making friends. The premise is simple: if you’re new to a city, or just want to meet someone new, the app connects you with like-minded others inside a set radius. You sign up via Facebook, build a basic profile, then approach people for friendship or arrange social events and invite others along. • The Tinderisation of modern life is on the rise I arranged a coffee meet-up for Saturday at 5.30pm, which after half an hour a guy called Harpal said he was coming to. I also followed a man called Jeff, something that means Wiith will notify me when he creates an event, and told some bloke called Youcef I’d join him for a run on tomorrow at 9pm. Youcef actually approved my coming along, and as I write this very sentence has just pinged me to say ‘hey’. I don’t really want to go for a run tomorrow. I feel bad now. Would you like to be friends with Jeff? It’s true that the current market for community-based dating and networking is becoming increasingly saturated. A fresh dating app seems to spring up every month, and friendship platforms are following suit – today, the young, mobile generation appreciates the practicality and instantaneous nature of forming relationships by scrolling through pictures and sending a few messages. With that in mind, Wiith already has a few similar models to compete with. There’s Skout, which brands itself as more of a friend app but has morphed into more of a dating landscape. Peoplehunt exists, too, although it is now mainly a tool for finding others who might be able to help you with something (language exchange classes are popular on the format). The most popular friend app around at the moment is Meetup, by a stretch. However, the app was founded as a website; its mobile platform isn't the smoothest, lacking the responsive, quick-fire style of its new competitor. • Bristlr: a dating app for bearded men and the women who love them Wiith co-founder Jeff Hodnett told TechCruch that he believed Meetup is “too rigid” for more natural, spontaneous get-togethers. It’s here where the app’s likeness to Tinder becomes starkly apparent. The new model is apparently more fluid, loose, and appears to favour randomness – all things young people enjoy. “We think Wiith is a lot more spontaneous than Meetup, along with not having the dating stigma of Tinder,” Hodnett said. If Wiith does manage to attract users and take on some of Meetups’ 20 million-plus fan base, it could prove a popular choice for business travellers keen to find someone to share an evening meal with, and city newbies hoping to track down a running partner within hours of unpacking their trainers. As for me, I'm hoping that some of those people sign up in the next 24 hours and make Youcef a proper offer... What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The news article is about the launch of a new San Francisco-based app called 'Wiith,' a matchmaking app focused solely on helping people make new friends in a city rather than finding romantic connections. Key points from the article include: 1. Wiith is designed to connect people seeking friendship, without any romance or sexual intentions. 2. The app functions similarly to Tinder, allowing users to sign up via Facebook, create a profile, and then approach people for friendship or arrange social events within a set radius. 3. Wiith's intention is to help users who are new to a city or just want to meet new people. 4. The popularity of dating apps is on the rise, and friendship platforms are now starting to follow in those footsteps. 5. Wiith faces competition from other similar apps, such as Skout and Peoplehunt, as well as the more popular and established platform, Meetup. 6. The app's co-founder, Jeff Hodnett, believes that Wiith is more spontaneous than Meetup and lacks the dating stigma associated with Tinder. 7. If the app can attract users and gain popularity, it might be an ideal choice for business travelers and newcomers to a city looking for companionship or activity partners. Overall, the article highlights the launch of a new app, Wiith, focused on helping people make friends and connect with like-minded individuals in a city. The app is designed to provide a more spontaneous and relaxed way to meet new people without the pressure of dating, setting it apart from popular dating apps like Tinder."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

An earthquake rattles the area and the tablet is broken. This puts their work a month behind schedule. A small boy discovers something the earthquake brought down a mountain and brings it to Bentley. He cleans it and it is revealed to be an ancient oil lamp. The inscription is translated as a pre-biblical Noah's Ark story. The party of scientists set off for the mountain where the artifact originated before it was dislodged by the earthquake.They set up base camp and plan their final assault on the mountain the next day. A storm hits the base camp that evening. As they set off the next morning an avalanche brings down an arm from a statue.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Get a medium-sized bowl and position a candle at the bottom of it. A taper candle works best, but any candle can work. Then, pour water into the bowl until the candle is almost covered. Leave about 1 in (2.5 cm) of candle sticking out of the water for the spell. It's best to use a black candle, if you have one. You can find a black taper candle at a department store, magickal supplies store, or online. Pour salt into your hand, then slowly sprinkle it in a circle around the candle. Add as much salt as you like to provide extra purification to your spell. You can use table salt for this, but it’s best to use sea salt or Epsom salt if you have it. They haven’t been processed like table salt, so their properties are more intact. a white light flowing into the water. Stare at the bowl of water and picture a beam of white light flowing into the bowl. Imagine that this light is a positive, cleansing light. Take several slow, deep breaths as you visualize the light. In Pagan traditions, the purpose of this practice is to imbue the water with positive energy to help your spell work. Use a match or lighter to light the candle. As it burns, recite a spell or say a prayer to break your curse. Make sure you finish your spell before the candle goes out.  You might say, “Earth, fire, water, and air, be the answer to my prayer, banish this curse and leave me pure, tonight I claim a blessed cure.” You could pray, “Dear God/Goddess, Please cleanse me of this negative energy and lift the curse. I know that you will make me free. Amen.” Don’t blow out your candle because it’s best to let it go out on its own. Let the candle continue burning until the wick reaches the water. At that point, the water will extinguish the fire. Your spell is almost complete! In Pagan traditions, it's believed that letting a candle go out on its own strengthens the spell and keeps the magic in place. Remove the candle from the water and bend it at the center. Keep bending until it breaks in half. Then, take the bowl and the candle outside. Dig a shallow hole and bury your candle. Burying the candle completes the spell to break the curse. Slowly pour the water so that you’re able to complete an entire circle. If you still have water, make another pass. You do this to seal the spell. The salt may kill grass around the buried candle. Summary:","output":"We are making a special magic water bowl to help break a curse. We put a candle in the bowl, add water and some salt around it. We then imagine a happy light going into the water. We light the candle and say a special wish or prayer. We wait for the candle to go out, then break it and bury it outside.

The other options given do not provide a practical solution to the problem, while air out resolves the issue effectively without causing any damage to the clothes. 1. Hang in closet: Hanging the smelly clothes in the closet might not alleviate the smell. In fact, it could cause the smell to spread to other clothes, making the problem worse. A closet can be a confined space, which could trap the odor and make it linger even longer. 2. Sniff: Sniffing the smelly clothes would not provide any solution to the issue. It would only confirm that the clothes indeed have a smell. 3. Get dirty: Getting the clothes dirty would not help the situation. Adding more dirt and grime to the clothes would not remove the smell but may even make it worse. 4. Become soiled: Similar to getting the clothes dirty, becoming soiled would also not help in solving the odor problem; it would only add to the discomfort and make the clothes even less wearable. On the other hand: 5. Air out: Airing out the clothes involves hanging them outside or in a well-ventilated area, allowing fresh air and sunlight to naturally neutralize the smell. Airing out the clothes can help eliminate odors by allowing the smell to dissipate into the air. Moreover, sunlight has natural antibacterial and odor-neutralizing properties, which can further help in removing the smell from the clothes. In conclusion, a human would choose to \\"air out\\" smelly clothes that cannot be washed, because it is the most effective and practical method among the given options. Airing out allows for natural odor removal, does not cause any harm to the clothes, and prevents the spread of smell to other garments.

Will it permanently change the face of the Official Singles Chart as we know it? Will unknown artists potentially break into the top 10? We spoke to George Ergatoudis, Head of Music for BBC Radio 1 and Radio 1Xtra. Streaming's gradually grown over the last couple of years. Meanwhile, digital downloads had been growing up until about nine months ago and looking at the data, they started to go into decline. I think there is a real correlation there, that streaming is starting to grow and it's starting to eat into download sales. So we've had week on week, for the last nine months, a decline in the amount of digital music being purchased. There is going to be an effect. It's not hugely significant because at the end of the day we're looking at huge volumes to get into the top 40, huge numbers of people listening to a song or huge numbers of people deciding to download it each week, actually those two are very closely connected. There's only ever so many truly memorable, powerful hit records in the market at any point in time that the huge mass market scale people are interested in. So actually the differences are there but they are relatively slight. I think that is actually the biggest issue out there at the moment, everybody has got access to so much music, how do you get to know what you like? Take a snapshot of what records at any moment in time people are enjoying listening to, it could be because it was on an advert or a film like Frozen or it could be because it is heavily supported on radio. Culturally there is still a huge import to the chart, as a kind of very simple measure of the most popular records in the market at any point in time, and that's a powerful play in terms of discovery as much as anything. We've got a pretty good awareness of what is going on in the market but there's no doubt we do keep a close eye. There's certain tracks occasionally and certain artists where we've decided we'll wait a little longer on it, see how it goes before we commit to putting them on the playlist. When you can see that they are doing really well in streaming or they are doing really well in the sales chart, then of course that can be an important bit of information to say there's quite a large number of people who are enjoying it, we should look at that again. No, I think it's really important that if we are talking about an accurate reflection of what people are listening to or are consuming in 2014 we need to include streaming alongside sales. But in terms of the dramatic effect or change it will have, no, because actually the top 40 as a snapshot of a moment in time works and it's very similar in both the streaming space and in the singles purchasing space. Follow us @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter and @Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube Summary:","output":"The inclusion of streaming data in the Top 40 is being seen as one of the biggest changes since downloads were added in 2005, and it has sparked discussions about whether it will change the face of the Official Singles Chart as we know it. In an interview, George Ergatoudis, Head of Music for BBC Radio 1 and Radio 1Xtra, revealed that streaming has gradually grown over the last couple of years while digital downloads have started to decline. This correlation suggests that streaming is eating into download sales. Although the effects of this shift might not be hugely significant, it does represent a change in the way people consume music. Ergatoudis argues that finding music people like is the biggest issue, as there is now so much access to it. The Top 40, therefore, remains an important tool for discovering popular records in the market at any point in time. As for unknown artists potentially breaking into the top 10, Ergatoudis acknowledges that certain tracks and artists occasionally receive close attention from the industry before being added to playlists or promoted more widely. Streaming performance can be an important factor in determining whether an artist is worth further consideration. Overall, including streaming data alongside sales is essential for accurately reflecting music consumption in 2014. While it may not have a dramatic effect on the Top 40's composition, it does represent a more comprehensive snapshot of the music landscape at any given moment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Review: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ I had an absolutely incredible time dining at Culinary Dreams last weekend, and I cannot sing their praises enough. This restaurant has managed to create an unforgettable experience, succeeding in both impeccable service and wonderfully diverse, mouth-watering dishes. From the moment I entered the premises, the ambience was nothing short of fantastic. The warm lighting combined with the beautifully arranged décor gave off a welcoming and cozy atmosphere. To enhance the experience, a soft, soothing live jazz performance provided the perfect musical backdrop as we enjoyed our meal. Upon being seated by the ever-friendly and professionally dressed host, the extensive and diverse menu offered a variety of dishes I was eager to try. The assortment of vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free options was impressive, that catered to the different dietary preferences of our party. To start, we ordered the bruschetta trio, which was a hit among my companions. The three unique variants - classic tomato and basil, sweet balsamic caramelized onions, and avocado and beet - created a perfect harmony of flavors, with each bite more delightful than the last. As the main course, I chose the pan-seared sea bass, and it was truly among the best I’ve ever sampled. The fish was tender and flavorful, while the accompanying lemon-caper sauce perfectly enhanced the dish without overpowering it. To top it off, the garlic mashed potatoes were creamy, smooth, and full of flavor - a star component themselves. Considering their attention to detail and a wide variety of desserts to choose from, it was almost impossible to select just one! We collectively decided to share their decadent chocolate lava cake and the fruity, refreshing mango-passionfruit cheesecake. Both were heavenly, with the rich, gooey chocolate lava cake soothing our sweet cravings and the velvety cheesecake lightening the palate. In addition to their impressive menu, the service at Culinary Dreams was exceptional. Our server, Amanda, went above and beyond to make sure our dining experience was nothing short of perfect. Attentive, informative, and exceptionally friendly, Amanda made stellar recommendations and ensured all our needs were met throughout the evening. Overall, my experience at Culinary Dreams far exceeded my expectations. This gem of a restaurant offers divine dishes to satisfy any craving, impeccable service that makes you feel at home, and an atmosphere that ensures an unforgettable dining experience. I recommend Culinary Dreams to everyone, and I cannot wait to return for another remarkable evening."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Alex is full of life and more interested in playing the fool, by dancing around and doing the \\"happy face/angry face\\" gag with his paw. Zuba shows him his paw, which has an Africa-shaped birthmark on it, which Alex also has on his paw. Just then, Makunga (Alec Baldwin), a scheming lion who wants to be Alpha Lion, challenges Zuba. Leaving Alex alone for a while, Zuba kicks the pride out of Makunga. As the fight is going on, Alex notices a piece of rope moving on the ground and follows it. He goes off the reserve and is captured by poachers, who dump him in a crate and put him in the bed of their truck. Zuba notices that his son is missing. He sees the truck moving along the fence of the reserve and hears his son, crying out for help. He runs and jumps on the truck. He manages to free the crate of its binds, when one of the poachers shoots him, causing him to fall off the truck. He doesn't notice that Alex's crate has fallen out of the truck-bed and into a nearby river. Despite the painful hole in his ear, he mourns the loss of his son.Meanwhile, in the box, Alex sits timidly. Finally, he reaches New York City and is fished out and put in the New York City Zoo. When he sees all the people looking at him, he starts to dance around, much to the audience's pleasure.

After his request for aid from the United States was denied , he drew closer to the Eastern bloc . He also entered Syria into a defense arrangement with Egypt and Saudi Arabia to confront the influence of the Baghdad Pact . In 1957 , Quwatli , who the US and the Pact countries failed to oust , sought to stem the leftist tide in Syria , but to no avail .

A top Dallas doctor today described the moment nurse Nina Pham learned she had contracted Ebola after caring for victim Thomas Eric Duncan in hospital, saying: 'She was scared'. Dr Gary Weinstein worked alongside 26-year-old Miss Pham  to treat Mr Duncan, a 42-year-old Liberian who was rushed to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on September 28. He said his colleague was petrified when she realised she had been infected with the deadly virus, saying: 'She risked her life to care for a patient, and now she was afraid for her life.' But he added: 'I think once she got over the initial fear and concern and was surrounded by her friends and colleagues,  that was comforting. She did remarkably well, emotionally.' Scroll down for videos. Doctor: Dr Gary Weinstein today described the moment his colleague Nina Pham, 26, learned she had contracted Ebola after caring for victim Thomas Eric Duncan in hospital, saying: 'She was scared' Victim: Dr Weinstein worked alongside Miss Pham (pictured, left, and, right, in hospital after her diagnosis) to treat Mr Duncan, a  Liberian who was rushed to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on September 28. Miss Pham, who suffered from a fever with a temperature of above 100.5 degrees prior to her devastating diagnosis, is now in a 'fair' condition at a National Institutes of Health isolation unit. She is one of two nurses to have developed Ebola after caring for Mr Duncan, who died on October 8. The second worker, Amber Vinson, 29, was diagnosed with the disease on Wednesday. She was later airlifted to Atlanta's Emory University Hospital in Georgia on a specialized plane with a quarantine unit. Speaking to WFAA-TV, Dr Weinstein insisted the two nurses - along with the rest of the team - had followed CDC guidelines, which, at the time, did not include the use of a full respiratory mask. When asked why Miss Pham and Miss Vinson caught Ebola, he said: 'I think that these two nurses took care of a critically-ill patient at a time when he was not in control of his body fluids. 'And at a time when the recommendations from the CDC (Centers of Disease Control and Prevention) that we were following did not include the full respiratory mask.' Bedridden: Dr Weinstein, who was captured on video earlier this week telling a bedridden Miss Pham not to cry (pictured), said his colleague was petrified when she realised she had been infected with the virus. Comforting: The doctor, who was behind the camera, told the brave nurse: 'Well, happy tears are okay' Hospital: During the converstion, Dr Weinsten insisted Miss Pham - along with the rest of the team at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital (pictured) - had followed CDC guidelines during their care of Mr Duncan. His comments are in stark contrast to the CDC's claims that a 'breach of protocol' must have taken place to enable the infection to spread through the two nurses' protective gear. The center is currently preparing to issue new guidelines on protective gear to safeguard the well-being of doctors and nurses who are caring for Ebola patients. During the conversation, Dr Weinstei said despite knowing of Mr Duncan's contagious condition, both Miss Vinson and Miss Pham volunteered to look after him, joining an 'amazing' medical team. 'It's been so heartwarming. This kind of illness, this process that we've been through, this is the essence of nursing. This is the epitome of health care,' he said. Another patient: Miss Pham is one of two nurses to have developed Ebola after caring for Mr Duncan, who died on October 8. The second, Amber Vinson (pictured) was diagnosed with the disease on Wednesday. Transfer: She was later airlifted to Atlanta's Emory University Hospital in Georgia on a specialized plane. The doctor, who was captured on video earlier this week telling a bedridden Miss Pham not to cry - unless they were 'happy tears'' - gave the nurse a hug in his hazmat suit following her diagnosis. He told the news station that Mr Duncan's death 10 days ago was 'very, very quick', saying: 'He was critically ill and unstable, and over a period of minutes, he lost his pulse and was dead,' He also revealed that, in terms of Ebola, he considered himself to be 'no risk', despite having spent days caring for all three victims of the disease at the Dallas-based hospital. He said this was because Mr Duncan's bodily fluids were being controlled by the time he started caring for him, and he has worn a respiratory mask in the presence of all three patients. Tragic: Dr Weinstein said he considered himself 'no risk' because Mr Duncan's (pictured) bodily fluids were being controlled by the time he started caring for him, and he has worn a respiratory mask at all times. 'My only interactions with any of these patients have been in completely covered respirators, no skin showing to the outside world,' said Dr Weinstein. 'I think I'm no risk.' However, he revealed he has been asked by officials to avoid public places and public transport, and to take his temperature on a daily basis. According to the latest figures, the Ebola death toll has now struck 4,546, bringing the total number of confirmed and suspected cases of the virus to 9,191. Outbreak: It comes as the Ebola death toll has struck 4,546, bringing the total number of confirmed and suspected cases of the virus to 9,191. Above, a health worker carries a baby to an Ebola holding center. Most cases of the virus have been recorded in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, all in West Africa. Symptoms of Ebola include a fever, a headache, diarrhea, vomiting, muscle and joint aches and in some cases bleeding. These appear two to 21 days after exposure to the disease, the CDC said. Even if a person is infected, the virus can only be passed on once symptoms appear. It is transmitted through direct contact with the affected person's bodily fluids.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How would one describe the sentiment of this tweet? @katieluckylegs Hahahahaha i love your drunk ass","output":"In analyzing the sentiment of this tweet, one could describe it as exhibiting a generally positive and light-hearted tone. This conclusion is drawn from a combination of the specific words and phrases used, as well as the overall context of the message.  First, the tweet begins with \\"Hahahahaha,\\" which is an expression of laughter. This suggests that the tweet's author found something amusing, further indicating a positive sentiment. The presence of laughter also connotes a relaxed and informal atmosphere, setting the stage for the rest of the message. Next, the phrase \\"i love\\" clearly communicates a positive feeling, as the word \\"love\\" denotes affection and fondness for something or someone. In this case, it seems that the tweet's author is referring to the person they are mentioning, \\"katieluckylegs\\". Moreover, the phrase \\"your drunk ass\\" may initially be seen as a negative or derogatory remark from a conventional standpoint. However, when taking the whole tweet into context, it is more likely to be an affectionate and playful tease directed towards the mentioned person. The word \\"drunk\\" indicates that the subject of the tweet is probably under the influence of alcohol, and the usage of the word \\"ass\\" can be colloquial slang to refer to a person informally. Therefore, it is fair to assume that the tweet is meant to poke fun at a close friend's intoxicated state in a light-hearted and non-malicious manner. In summary, the sentiment of this tweet can be described as positive, jovial, and humorous, reflecting the tweet author's enjoyment and affection towards their friend's amusing behavior while intoxicated. This interpretation takes into account the language, expressions, and overall context of the message, leading to a comprehensive understanding of its sentiment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Gases cause pressure beneath the earth - The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface - The magma cools - With enough time the pressure builds up greatly - The resulting volcano may explode.  Question: suppose crust is pushed upward happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER eruptions.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"To answer the question, let's break it down step-by-step: Step 1: Gases cause pressure beneath the Earth. Justification: Gases are formed due to the Earth's mantle melting and producing magma. As the magma gets closer to the Earth's crust, the pressure of these gases increases. Step 2: The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface. Justification: When the pressure of the gases becomes too high, they push the molten magma towards the Earth's surface, eventually reaching a weak point in the crust and erupting. Step 3: The magma cools. Justification: Once the magma reaches the Earth's surface, it starts to cool down and solidify, forming volcanic rocks and other materials. Step 4: With enough time, the pressure builds up greatly. Justification: As more magma and gases accumulate beneath the crust, the pressure continues to build, eventually resulting in a volcanic eruption. Step 5: The resulting volcano may explode. Justification: If the pressure builds up to a certain threshold, it may cause a large, explosive eruption. Now, let's consider the scenario where the crust is pushed upward, and how it may affect smaller eruptions: If the crust is pushed upward, the pressure required for an eruption could increase, as the magma would need to travel a greater distance to reach the surface. This could lead to: 1. Less effect on smaller eruptions - If the pressure required for smaller eruptions is not significantly changed by the crust being pushed upward, then it is possible that these eruptions will continue to occur at a similar frequency and intensity.   2. More effect on smaller eruptions - If the increased distance and pressure required for the magma to reach the surface significantly impacts smaller eruptions, they may become less frequent or less intense, as more pressure would be needed for an eruption to occur. 3. No effect on smaller eruptions - If the upward movement of the crust has no significant impact on the pressure required for an eruption or the magma's ability to reach the surface, then the smaller eruptions may continue to occur as they were previously. In summary, the answer to the question is dependent on the specific conditions and how much the crust is pushed upward. If the crust's movement significantly changes the pressure required for eruptions, it may result in smaller eruptions occurring less frequently or less intensely. On the other hand, if there is no significant impact on the pressure required for eruptions, there may be no effect on smaller eruptions."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy Attacks Republican Peers Governors tend to pull their punches when it comes to criticizing their peers. Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy is playing a different game. Attacking New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie by name, taking a shot at Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s concern over terror attacks in Milwaukee, and mocking Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal’s presidential aspirations, the New England Democrat has no qualms about taking the fight to the GOP. “Such a charitable man,” Malloy said of Christie, with a proverbial tongue in his cheek. “He has spread goodwill to so many places. He’s really quite remarkable, isn’t he.” Moments earlier, in an interview with TIME on Thursday, he muffled a laugh as he described Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, whose remarks he once called “the most insane statement I’ve ever heard,” as the “toughest one to beat in the Republican field.” Seizing an opportunity in a party depleted of household names not Clinton or Obama, Malloy is rising to the occasion, positioning himself as one of the party’s top attack dogs as the 2016 cycle approaches. But Malloy is also envisioning a larger role for himself within the party too. Addressing the winter meeting of the Association of State Democratic Chairs Thursday he delivered a fiery speech, imploring the party to refocus on its core values. “When we run as Republican-lite we lose,” he said. “Let us be Democrats once again,” he added, earning a standing ovation and whooping cheers. Malloy was one of the few Democratic success stories of 2014, expanding his margin of victory in a repeat of his 2010 grudge match with Republican Tom Foley. He holds up his support of gun control laws and minimum wage hikes as a model for other Democrats. As the chair-designate of the Democratic Governors Association, it will be Malloy’s job next year to try to pick up seats from Republicans, who now hold a near-record 31 governorships. Speaking to TIME, Malloy wasn’t shy about attacking his GOP colleagues, and expanded on his call for the Democratic Party to stop being “Republicans-lite.” Below is a lightly edited and condensed transcript: Gov. Dan Malloy: My message is first of all we’ve got to elect a democratic president. Otherwise the hard fought gains that we made under this president will be swept away. We’ve got to begin the process of changing the Congress and each election we need to pick up seats and we need to be on the offensive. What I’m hoping to do is see Democrats get elected. That’s what I’m trying to contribute to. TIME: But you’re saying the right type of Democrat, right? Malloy: I think any Democrat is better. But I think what my message is, it’s about running as a Democrat. It’s about talking about Democratic values. I think we have to talk about Democratic values in this country again, because I think Republicans and their allies on Fox and elsewhere have done a good job of confusing people about who is actually pulling for them. You know and I know and economists know that trickle-down economics doesn’t work. But we’ve got all kinds of people in this country who are confused by what they hear on fox everyday or elsewhere everyday and actually believe that somehow that’s going to trickle down to them even though during the last 25-30 years when trickle-down has been so often rolled out by Republicans, the middle class has not gotten bigger, wages are not up, quality of life for many of our citizens is not increasing the way that it should. So I think we need to be talking about our values versus their values. Listen, I’ve got rich friend. I don’t mind the rich getting richer, but the poor shouldn’t be getting poorer and there should be more people moving into the middle class. TIME: Are some Democrats in Washington not doing enough of that? Did that contribute to the defeats in 2014? Malloy: I think there are a lot of people who consciously or unconsciously, ran away from the president and the ideals of the party, and I’m not going to name names, but I think it’s important that we do what Republicans do, and view elections as a portion of the continuum, not as a stand-alone event. And every election needs to be built in part on the prior one and every new success needs to be built upon a prior success. And if we do that I think we’ll be stronger. TIME: Looking ahead to 2016, should there be other Democrats entering the race to have this sort of dialogue? Malloy: That’s up to other people. I think people have to make their decisions about whether they want to run. I think there are a lot of Democrats who want Hillary to run and I think she would be an extremely strong candidate for the nomination and to be elected. I’m glad we don’t have 23 people running for president right now, although, as I said, I think the toughest one to beat would be Bobby Jindal. So we have to worry about him. People are either going to run for president or not, she’s going to either run for president or not, I think it looks more and more like that she’s going to, but she’ll cross that bridge when she gets to it. TIME: Have you ever given it any thought? Malloy: No. Whenever people say you should president, I say, ‘I thought you liked me.’ Listen, I thought being mayor of Stamford was a wonderful job. Being governor of a state for a period of time is a wonderful job, and I’m not sure I’m at all attracted to Washington. TIME: Gov. Chris Christie to your south seems to be having a bit of a rough turn. Malloy: Such a charitable man. He has spread goodwill to so many places. He’s really quite remarkable, isn’t he. TIME: He’s been facing some budget issues and dealing with pension reform… Malloy: Dealing with pension reform. He’s in the process of destroying public pensions, which by the way comes out of the Republican playbook. He hasn’t told the truth about what he’s doing, but that’s what he’s doing. The level of defunding that’s taken place under his administration is remarkable and I think the state’s bond rating will pay perhaps not a permanent price, but a longterm price. He’ll saddle that problem to some unfortunate Democrat who’s going to have to come in and do the right thing. That’s the hard part about being a Democrat, you have to clean up after Republicans. TIME: Are you concerned that momentum Republicans are showing? Malloy: Yeah, that’s why I gave a speech. That’s why I think we have to rise as Democrats. I understand that everybody’s got to make tough choices in elections, but to defund your pension system by billions and billions of dollars, which is what New Jersey has done is not the right thing to do. To take away people’s rights to collectively negotiate their contracts, that’s not the right thing to do. And neither one of those things is going to help the middle class of those states. It’s just not going to. In some states it works to bash people who are a little bit better off than you to maybe make you feel better, but it is not a proven way to raise up the middle class, to raise the size of the middle class or to raise people’s standards of living. TIME: On gun control, do you see a path to revitalizing the national conversation around gun control? Malloy: There will be more and more events like Sandy Hook. Look at the number of children that have been killed in schools since Sandy Hook. I’ve stopped counting, it’s astronomical when you think about the killing of children or babies. This discussion is not done. People actually understand that mentally ill people should not be able to buy guns, that people with violent felony backgrounds should not be able to buy guns. They understand that. It’s when the other side wraps it with rhetoric like ‘they want to take your gun away.’ Well, no one wants to take your gun away, unless you’re, you know, a violent felon or you’re mentally ill, or you’ve threatened someone with it. That’s not happening anywhere. This conversation’s going to play out over a long period of time, and then the states that have done something about it, like my state, we continue to see a precipitous drop in homicides, and crime falling in Connecticut at three times the national average. TIME: Where do you stand on the legalization of marijuana? Malloy: That’s not something I’m interested in. I decriminalized marijuana. We have 6,000 fewer arrests as a result of decriminalizing it, and we passed medical marijuana and I’m comfortable with where we are. I think it would be a mistake to become involved in the sale of marijuana for income purposes. It should be a standalone decision, it shouldn’t be based on whether you’re going to get a little money for it. TIME: You’re taking over as chair of the DGA next year, what are you hoping to accomplish? Malloy: There are not a lot of Democratic governors, and we need to go our and fight the fight and take some of those states back and lay the groundwork for taking others back four years from now. I’ve always played a leadership role in any organization I’ve been apart of and I certainly have been the beneficiary of other governors, so I want to pay that back. I think this is important work. I think what Republicans pulled off in state legislatures following the Census and their wins in 2010 has been very hurtful to the country. We have too few districts in the country that are in play, and as a result the Congress of the United States doesn’t do what it was intended to do, and that is to actually represent the majority will of the people. They’ve in other words, been gerrymandered. TIME: Do you plan to step up your role in the party? Malloy: Obviously I’m here, and I was asked to speak, and there weren’t a whole lot of wins, so they’ve asked me to participate. And yes I’m going to play a role in trying to get more people elected as Democrats to the Houses and Senates and Assemblies, and more governors, and I’m on the lookout for good candidates for governor in the 2016 cycle. Some of those are pretty well set and some of those are going to be pretty wide open. TIME: Have you started the recruitment process? Malloy: We are engaged in the recruitment process. That begins with talking to people who are expressing interest and making sure that people understand what it is to be a candidate in a statewide election. You have a lot of folks who want to run who’ve never run statewide and it’s not an easy thing to do. Part of our job is to make sure people understand and are sufficiently committed to doing that. TIME: What are your thoughts on the Republican governors who have warned about the threat of ISIS as their party is embroiled in a shutdown fight over the Department of Homeland Security. Malloy: Those Republican governors should talk to the Republican members of Congress who are threatening to defund the agency that they are otherwise relying on. You know, it’s a wonderful thing, Republicans have both sides of their mouth and they’re able to use them well. The governor complains that there is a threat of ISIS in Milwaukee, but the Republican members of the Congress vote against funding the agency that’s charged with protecting us from it because they have a disagreement with the president over the ability of the people who were brought to this country as children and who have graduated from our school systems, to stay in this country. When they only speak English. That’s what this fight’s about. Republicans—they want to have both sides of the immigration issue, they want to have both sides of the job issue, they want to have both sides of the healthcare issue, and it’s incumbent on some of us not to let them get away with it. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The article discusses Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy's combative approach toward his Republican peers, putting himself in the spotlight by attacking them by name and challenging their political ideals.

Passage: Established on Kīlauea in 1912, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO), presently a branch of the United States Geological Survey, is the primary organization associated with the monitoring, observance, and study of Hawaiian volcanoes. Thomas A. Jaggar, the observatory's founder, attempted a summit expedition to Mauna Loa to observe its 1914 eruption, but was rebuffed by the arduous trek required (see Ascents). After soliciting help from Lorrin A. Thurston, in 1915 he was able to persuade the US Army to construct a \\"simple route to the summit\\" for public and scientific use, a project completed in December of that year; the Observatory has maintained a presence on the volcano ever since.Eruptions on Mauna Loa are almost always preceded and accompanied by prolonged episodes of seismic activity, the monitoring of which was the primary and often only warning mechanism in the past and which remains viable today. Seismic stations have been maintained on Hawaiʻi since the Observatory's inception, but these were concentrated primarily on Kīlauea, with coverage on Mauna Loa improving only slowly through the 20th century. Following the invention of modern monitoring equipment, the backbone of the present-day monitoring system was installed on the volcano in the 1970s. Mauna Loa's July 1975 eruption was forewarned by more than a year of seismic unrest, with the HVO issuing warnings to the general public from late 1974; the 1984 eruption was similarly preceded by as much as three years of unusually high seismic activity, with volcanologists predicting an eruption within two years in 1983.The modern monitoring system on Mauna Loa is constituted not only by its locally seismic network but also of a large number of GPS stations, tiltmeters, and strainmeters that have been anchored on the volcano to monitor ground deformation due to swelling in Mauna Loa's subterranean magma chamber, which presents a more complete picture of the events proceeding eruptive activity. The GPS network is the most durable and wide-ranging of the three systems, while the tiltmeters provide the most sensitive predictive data, but are prone to erroneous results unrelated to actual ground deformation; nonetheless a survey line across the caldera measured a 76 mm (3 in) increase in its width over the year preceding the 1975 eruption, and a similar increase in 1984 eruption. Strainmeters, by contrast, are relatively rare. The Observatory also maintains two gas detectors at Mokuʻāweoweo, Mauna Loa's summit caldera, as well as a publicly accessible live webcam and occasional screenings by interferometric synthetic aperture radar imaging.

Summarize this article: But he told the BBC's Andrew Marr the UK needed a \\"hard-headed assessment\\" of issues such as the EU customs union. On the same programme, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox did not reveal his stance on the customs union, which sets standard tariffs EU-wide. He said he was \\"a free trader\\", but the government would reach a view. Staying a member of the customs union would, however, mean \\"limitations\\" on the UK's ability to set its own trade tariffs, which would in turn limit the kind of deals it could do with the rest of the world, Mr Fox added. Who has access to the single market? What are the UK's post-Brexit trade options? Mr Osborne, who argued for Remain, said it was essential that close relations with countries such as France and Germany were not sacrificed in pursuit of new trade deals with other nations including China. He told the Andrew Marr Show: \\"Yes it's true the grass may be greener outside of these arrangements and we may be able to conduct new trade deals with the United States, Australia and so on. \\"But that shouldn't come at a price of giving up existing free trade agreements we have with Germany and France. \\"You can't say we are a beacon of free trade in the world and then the main thing you achieve is a huge act of protectionism, the biggest in British history.\\" Mr Osborne - who lost his job in the cabinet after the referendum - admitted the Remain campaign lacked \\"some of the authenticity and optimism\\" of the Leave camp, and focused too much on dire predictions. \\"We discovered there was not much out there in terms of support for European friendship and so we ended up talking a lot about the economy and, as chancellor, of course, I was centre stage in that.\\" He also said the pledge to get net migration down to the tens of thousands \\"damaged\\" the government in the referendum because \\"we didn't really have an answer\\" when challenged on why it had been missed. Mr Osborne said he hoped the predictions he made about the economy post-Brexit turn out \\"not to be true.\\" But he told the programme he would \\"wait and see what happens\\" as the pound had fallen sharply since the referendum and Britain was \\"poorer as a result\\". Also speaking to Andrew Marr, Mr Fox said Brexit the question of the customs union was \\"not binary\\". \\"I hear people talking about hard Brexit and soft Brexit as though it's a boiled egg we are talking about, it's a little more complex. So, Turkey, for example, is in part of the customs union, but not in other parts.\\" Mr Osborne's appearance on the show marked his first TV interview since he was sacked by Prime Minister Theresa May. He said he had \\"learned a lot\\" during his time as chancellor and wanted to attempt to understand what he had got right and what went wrong. During the London 2012 Paralympics he was booed while handing out a medal, which he admitted \\"hurt\\", particularly as his children were in the crowd. But he added: \\"Sometimes those moments do help change you for the better.\\" He said his work trying to promote a Northern Powerhouse was also allowing him to travel around the country and attempt to \\"understand why people feel the system is not working for them\\". Earlier this week, the former chancellor told a Commons debate British MPs were deceiving themselves if they thought they did not have some responsibility for what had happened in Syria. Summary:","output":"The article discusses the perspectives of the UK's international trade secretary, Liam Fox, and former British Chancellor, George Osborne, on the EU customs union, in relation to Brexit. Fox did not disclose his position on keeping the UK in the customs union, which sets standard EU-wide tariffs. However, he mentioned that continuing as a member would constrain the UK's ability to set its own trade tariffs, and this could restrict what trade deals the UK could establish with countries outside the EU. In contrast, Osborne urged not to sacrifice relations with EU countries like France and Germany to pursue new trade agreements with nations like China. He added that abandoning existing free trade deals with Germany and France may symbolize the UK as a protectionist state, which could contradict its position as a proponent of global free trade.  Further, Osborne admitted that the Remain campaign during the Brexit referendum lacked the authentic appeal of the Leave campaign. He also believed the government's commitment to reduce net migration to tens of thousands to have negatively impacted the referendum's outcome. He conveyed his hopes that the economic predictions he made regarding post-Brexit consequences are proved wrong, as the consequent sharp fall in the pound's value has made the UK poorer. Fox also compared Brexit with a complex situation rather than the simplistic views of a 'hard' or 'soft' Brexit, using Turkey as an example of a country that is part of some components of the customs union but not others. The article also covered Osborne's first television interview after his dismissal by the Prime Minister, Theresa May. During his interview, he reconciled with his past experiences as a chancellor and acknowledged his moments of criticism while recognizing his efforts to understand why people feel the societal system is not working for them. Furthermore, Osborne referred to the UK's collective responsibility over the crisis in Syria during a previous Commons debate."},{"instruction":"Tom Sawyer is known as one of the most beloved characters in American literature , but new research found that Mark Twain based this character on his friend named Tom Sawyer. He admired his firefighting friend so much that he gave the character his name. Mark Twain and Tom Sawyer had many adventures together, gambling in Nevada and drinking in pubs. Tom Sawyer once worked as a volunteer firefighter, policeman and customs officer. Before making his way out West, Tom Sawyer used his strength to save 90 people from a burning ship. Mark Twain was particularly moved by this story because his own brother died in a fire while working on a similar steamboat. The two men became friends immediately after meeting in 1863, with Tom Sawyer traveling to Virginia City, while Mark Twain was working as a reporter there. After one night they returned to San Francisco, Mark Twain told his friend that he would base a character in his yet-unwritten book on him. Tom Sawyer said, \\"One day he said to me, 'I'm going to put you between the covers of a book, Tom.' 'Go ahead, Sam,' I Said, 'but don't disgrace my name.'\\" Besides their fondness of drinking, the two men also shared a hobby for storytelling. Tom sawyer believed that it was his anecdotes about his own childhood that inspired Mark Twain to create a book on him. Finally Mark Twain said that the character of Tom sawyer was based on a mix of three real people---John B. Briggs, William Bowen and himself. In spite of this, the historical evidence shows that there might be a fourth, more prominent influencer. Which of the following is TRUE according to the text? A) Mark Twain wanted to be a firefighter after he knew Tom Sawyer. B) Tom Sawyer saved Mark Twain's life in a terrible fire C) Tom Sawyer's experience inspired Mark Twain to create a work.

Upon his arrival, he quickly discovers that his conniving stepmother, Natalie, and her cunning son, Troy, have devised a plan to swindle him out of his birthright. Forced to grapple with a twisted family dynamic and unsure of who to trust, Lucas sets out on a thrilling journey to uncover the truth and secure his rightful fortune. Act 1: Lucas Walker, a young and successful architect, receives the news of his father's death, and with great reluctance, he returns to his childhood home: the magnificent and sprawling Walker Estate. He's greeted by his stepmother Natalie, who's seemingly kind, offering her condolences, but Lucas sees through her façade. While attending the reading of his father's will, he's shocked to find out that his inheritance, including the estate and his father's company, has been left in the hands of Troy, his conniving half-brother. Lucas firmly believes that he's entitled to at least half of the fortune but is told by the family lawyer that the will is rock-solid. Act 2: Feeling betrayed, Lucas starts investigating the truth behind the will. During his search, he comes across his father's secret study, where he finds hints that lead him to believe there might be a hidden, authentic will that could reinstate his inheritance. He confides in Emma, the family housekeeper, who has known him since childhood and is skeptical of Natalie's motives. As Lucas delves deeper, he discovers that his father had evidence of Natalie's infidelities and was planning on divorcing her. He realizes that she must have orchestrated the false will to secure her own future. Lucas and Emma collaborate to find the real will by following clues left through encrypted letters, coded messages, and secret compartments within the estate. Act 3: The pursuit of the truth becomes increasingly dangerous when Lucas realizes that Troy is monitoring his every move, desperate to protect the ill-gotten fortune. Several near-death encounters send Lucas and Emma spiraling deeper into this twisted family saga. In a climactic confrontation with Natalie and Troy, Lucas uncovers the authentic will and learns that his father was, indeed, leaving everything to him. The family lawyer, who had been in cahoots with Natalie, is exposed as a co-conspirator in the plot. In the end, Lucas successfully reclaims his inheritance, bringing Natalie and Troy to justice. He decides to honor his father's legacy by taking over the company and turning the Walker Estate into a home for underprivileged children. Grateful for Emma's loyalty and support, he promotes her to the estate's general manager. Despite all the betrayal, Lucas finds solace in knowing that he restored the family's values and integrity that his father once stood for."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The film is centered around a group of friends who get stranded in the open sea while on a yacht excursion. Amy (played by Susan May Pratt) is dealing with a childhood trauma involving water and is reluctant to leave the boat. Step 1: Briefly describe the critical event that leads to them being stranded During the movie, one of the friends, Zach, suggests that they all go swimming. They all jump into the water, forgetting to lower the yacht's ladder before getting off the boat. This leaves them stranded in the water with no way to get back on the boat. Step 2: Describe the progression of the story and the fates of the characters Throughout the film, the friends struggle with exhaustion, dehydration, panic, and some suffer from severe injuries. Dan (played by Eric Dane) is shown in several scenes sleeping or unconscious on the boat as the others struggle in the water. One by one, the characters face various fates: 1. Michelle drowns after exhaustion from swimming and trying to get back on the boat. 2. Lauren dies after falling from a makeshift rope that the group forms to reach the boat's railing. 3. James gets bitten by sharks and dies in Amy's arms. 4.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Question 1: If the atmosphere was much thicker than it is now, how would the sun appear? If the atmosphere were much thicker than it currently is, several changes would occur that would affect the appearance of the sun. The overall density of the air would be higher, leading to increased scattering of the sunlight as it passes through the atmosphere. As a result, the sun would appear less intense and more diffuse or larger. Additionally, a thicker atmosphere would cause increased absorption of certain parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) light. This could result in a sun that appears more reddish in color, as shorter wavelengths of light (blue and green) would be scattered more effectively, leaving the longer wavelengths (red, orange, and yellow) to dominate. Lastly, the overall brightness of the sun might be reduced due to the larger amount of absorption and scattering of light by the atmosphere. The sky itself might appear more hazy, particularly during sunrise and sunset when the sun is low in the sky and its light has to pass through a greater amount of the atmosphere. Question 2: How old do you have to be to volunteer for a political campaign? In 2018 I will be 15 years-old. Will I be able to volunteer for midterm campaigns? The age at which someone can volunteer for a political campaign varies depending on the specific requirements of the campaign itself, as well as any legal requirements or restrictions. Generally, there is no federal legal age requirement for volunteering on political campaigns, but individual campaigns or local laws may have specific age requirements. In many cases, teenagers as young as 15 years old (like yourself) are able to volunteer for political campaigns, but the types of tasks or activities they can participate in may be limited. In some cases, volunteers under 18 may need parental permission or supervision. Overall, it is likely that you would be able to volunteer for midterm campaigns in some capacity as a 15-year-old, but you may need to check with the specific campaign or organization that you're interested in volunteering with to ensure you meet their requirements or guidelines. As for the answer to the two questions being the same, it is clear that the subjects of the questions are different and not directly related. The first question deals with the appearance of the sun if the Earth's atmosphere were to be thicker, while the second question pertains to eligibility to volunteer for a political campaign based on age. Therefore, the answers to these two questions would not be the same."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: When the world was young, the gods did battle in the sky. The victors ruled on Mt. Olympus and imprisoned the vanquished -- the Titans -- beneath Mt. Tartarus on Earth. Also lost during the battle is the Bow of Epirus, a mighty weapon that can shoot invincible energy arrows.Centuries later, King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke) mounts a campaign to recover the Bow of Epirus and free the Titans. Bitter over the deaths of his wife and children due to disease, he is resolved to destroy the gods who refused his prayers to spare his family. He overtakes the Sybelline Monastery, imprisoning the virgin oracle Phaedra (Freida Pinto) and her attendants, then lays waste to villages in the area. In one village works the stone mason Theseus (Henry Cavil). Theseus has been trained in the military arts by a mysterious Old Man (John Hurt) who encourages him to be a protector of all humanity; Theseus, whose devout mother was raped and thus considered an outcast, refuses. When the goddess Athena (Isabel Lucas) visits the Old Man, he is revealed to be Zeus (Luke Evans) in human disguise.When Hyperion's forces destroy Theseus's village, he kills Theseus's mother in front of him and imprisons Theseus, where Phaedra and her attendants are also kept. Phaedra inadvertently touches Theseus and has a vision of him as either the savior of humanity or the ally of Hyperion in the destruction of the world. That night, she and her attendants seduce and kill the guards; Phaedra escapes with Theseus and two other slaves, Stavros (Steven Dorff) and Daerios (Alan Van Spring).Although Zeus has forbidden the gods to intervene unless the Titans are freed, Athena, Poseidon (Kellan Lutz) and Ares (Daniel Sharman) determine to protect Theseus as best they can. Phaedra tells Theseus he must return to his village and properly bury his mother. There, Theseus discovers the Bow of Epirus. Hyperion has sent the Minotaur (Robert Maillet) and soldiers to intercept them. The soldiers kill Daerios but, after a brutal battle with the Minotaur, Theseus uses the Bow to... Answer:","output":"Critically discuss the themes and characterization represented in the movie plot about the mythical world where gods, Titans, and humans cohabit. How does the film use King Hyperion's search for the Bow of Epirus and his desire to free the Titans reflect his internal conflicts and bitterness towards the gods, in particular towards their indifference towards human suffering? How does the character of Theseus evolve as the plot progresses, from a reluctant hero forced into a mission to avenge his mother's death to the protector of humanity?  Examine the manner in which the relationship between Theseus and Phaedra develops, and how it further affects Theseus's objectives and motivations. Can you identify the implication of Phaedra's vision when she touches Theseus? Also, review how the gods implement their plans to intervene despite Zeus’s prohibition unless the Titans are freed.  Reflect on how the movie unfolds the role of the Bow of Epirus and its significance in the plotline. How are its powers and characteristics explained and demonstrated throughout the film, particularly during the encounter with the Minotaur and soldiers? Furthermore, analyze how the narrative presents the Greek mythology that includes Mt. Olympus, Mt. Tartarus, the Sybelline Monastery, Minotaur, among others. How does it deal with their traditional definitions and imagery? How does the film's plot tie in these mythical elements and align with or deviate from the classical stories? Lastly, delve into the representation of divine intervention and free will and how they play into the movie's plot progress. Assess the moral implications the movie suggests in the conflict between gods and humans, the power struggle among the gods themselves, and humans’ confrontation with their own destinies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the mother of the girl that the professor of French Literature is attracted to? from the following article ?  In 1947, Humbert Humbert, a middle-aged European professor of French literature, travels to the United States to take a teaching position in New Hampshire. He rents a room in the home of widow Charlotte Haze, largely because he is romantically attracted to her adolescent daughter Dolores, also called \\"Lo\\", who he sees while touring the house. Obsessed from boyhood with girls of approximately her age (whom he calls \\"nymphets\\"), Humbert is immediately smitten with Lo and gets married to Charlotte only just to be near her daughter. Charlotte finds Humbert's secret diary and discovers his preference for her daughter. Furious, Charlotte runs out of the house, when she is struck by a car and killed.  Her death frees Humbert to pursue a romantic and sexual relationship with Lo, whom he nicknames \\"Lolita\\". Humbert and Lo then travel the country, staying in various motels before eventually settling in the college town of Beardsley, where Humbert takes a teaching job and Lo begins attending an all-girls Catholic school. However, Lo's increasing boredom with Humbert, combined with her growing desire for independence, fuels a constant tension that lead to a fight between them. Humbert's affection for Lo is also rivaled by another man, playwright Clare Quilty, who has been pursuing Lo since the beginning of the pair's travels. Lo eventually escapes with Quilty, and Humbert's search for them is unsuccessful, especially as he doesn't know Quilty's name. Three years later, Humbert receives a letter from Lo asking for money. Humbert visits Lo, who is now married and pregnant. Humbert asks her to run away with him, but she refuses. He relents and gives her a substantial amount of money. Lo also reveals to Humbert how Quilty actually tracked young girls and took them to Pavor Manor, his home in Parkington, to exploit them for child pornography. Quilty abandoned her after she refused to be in one of his films. The answer is:","output":"Charlotte Haze."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue.

Q: To make certain the U.S. was aware of the danger, in July 1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, Szilard and Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs, which Einstein, a pacifist, said he had never considered. He was asked to lend his support by writing a letter, with Szilard, to President Roosevelt, recommending the U.S. pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research. A secret German facility, apparently the largest of the Third Reich, covering 75 acres in an underground complex, was being re-excavated in Austria in December 2014 and may have been planned for use in nuclear research and development. The letter is believed to be \\"arguably the key stimulus for the U.S. adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II\\". In addition to the letter, Einstein used his connections with the Belgian Royal Family and the Belgian queen mother to get access with a personal envoy to the White House's Oval Office. President Roosevelt could not take the risk of allowing Hitler to possess atomic bombs first. As a result of Einstein's letter and his meetings with Roosevelt, the U.S. entered the \\"race\\" to develop the bomb, drawing on its \\"immense material, financial, and scientific resources\\" to initiate the Manhattan Project. It became the only country to successfully develop an atomic bomb during World War II. For Einstein, \\"war was a disease ... [and] he called for resistance to war.\\" By signing the letter to Roosevelt he went against his pacifist principles. In 1954, a year before his death, Einstein said to his old friend, Linus Pauling, \\"I made one great mistake in my life--when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justification--the danger that the Germans would make them ...\\" <sep>Who was asked to send a letter to President Roosevelt, recommending the U.S. pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research?<sep>Einstein A:","output":"Yes"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Scottish Crime and Justice survey (SCJS) showed that theft or damage to property was the most widely reported crime, making up 71% of the figures. The SCJS also reported the risk of crime in Scotland to be lower than that in England and Wales. The survey showed there was a total of 815,000 recorded incidents of crime over the past year. The new figures showed a 22% drop from the 1,045,000 recorded incidents in 2008-2009. The risk of being a victim of crime also dropped from 20.4% in 2008-2009 to 16.9% in 2012-2013, a drop described as \\"significant\\" by the report. Those living in the most deprived areas were more likely to be a victim of crime. Violent crime continued to fall, with a 25% drop in recorded incidents since 2008-2009. However, the public's fear of being the victim of a violent crime such as mugging has increased, with the perceived risk being almost 20% higher than the actual one. The statistics also showed that public confidence in the police and justice system had increased, with 61% of people saying they believed that their local police were doing a good job. Over three quarters of people surveyed also believed that the level of crime in their areas had stayed the same or reduced. Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill said: \\"This survey confirms what we already know. Crime is falling, the risk of being a victim of crime is falling and more people are feeling safer in their communities. \\"The chance of being a victim of crime continues to be in lower in Scotland than in England and Wales and violent crime in Scotland has fallen by a quarter since 2008-2009. It is also reassuring to see that confidence in the police and the criminal justice system continues to improve. He added: \\"These statistical trends are consistent with recorded crime statistics which show crime in Scotland is at its lowest level in almost 40 years with the 1,000 additional police officers that this government has put in communities protecting the public.\\" Scottish Conservative chief whip John Lamont questioned the effectiveness of the survey by saying that many victims of crime did not report it. He said: \\"There are a number of areas of concern within these findings. It's clear far too many people are victims of crime, and a significant amount don't even bother reporting it because they don't believe it will be solved. \\"There is a big difference in what victims want and what actually happens, and one way the SNP could deal with this is facing up to justice matters and dropping its soft-touch approach.\\" He then added: \\"It is extremely rich of the SNP to be bleating about crime and policing rates when it has closed 60% of Scotland's police stations.\\" Scottish Labour's Community Safety spokeswoman, Elaine Murray said: \\"While any reduction in crime is to be welcomed, the fact that violent crime is up and only a fraction of crime is reported to the police gives cause for concern. \\"The figures also won't reflect the closure of police counters, nor the police officers being taken off our streets to backfill staff roles left empty by SNP cuts. \\"I fear that with the loss of local, accountable policing we will see the potential for the overall figures to begin to move the other way and for confidence in our police to fall back\\", she added.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  A suicide bomber detonates himself at a party in Java, Indonesia, and a Javanese Sultan's daughter, Sultana, is believed to be one of the unidentified victims. Jake Travers, an American posing as a graduate student from Cornell University, was at the scene of the blast and is held as a witness by a police detective of Detachment 88, Lieutenant Hashim.  After interviewing Jake at the crime scene, Hasim and Jake are attacked by terrorists led by Malik and his henchman Achmed. Jake saves Hashim and kills two terrorists, but Achmed manages to escape. Hashim becomes suspicious after he observes Jake's combat skills. Jake and Hashim are brought to the hospital where Hashim's wife meets Jake. At Hashim's wife's insistence, Hashim invites Jake to their house for breakfast. At the house, Hashim tells Jake that he ran a background check on him through Interpol. Jake tells Hashim he is an FBI agent conducting an undercover investigation, and suggests they cooperate with one another.  Returning to his apartment, Jake faxes to a friend stateside a photo of a tattoo from the corpse believed to be Sultana's. Jake's friend informs him that the tattoo is typically used by Chinese high-class prostitutes, which confirms Jake's suspicion that the body is not Sultana's. Jake follows a lead to a night club, where he brings home a prostitute bearing a similar tattoo.

They’re under huge pressure to write and publish but an ever-growing mountain of teaching and admin is stopping them doing just that. Our research finds that whilst nobody is immune to these pressures, some academics cope better than others – and that’s because over the years, they’ve developed personal “systems” to help them write. We recently carried out in-depth interviews with 23 scholars across the UK, Europe and the US. We deliberately chose a diverse group so as to not make any assumptions based on age, seniority, or research background. Academic experience ranged from six months to 27 years and subject fields ranged from social sciences, economics, business, and arts. We did this as part of our user research to inform the development of Prolifiko – a digital coaching tool for writers. Whilst every academic had developed a writing productivity system personal to them, we found there were six common “habits” that the most prolific (and generally least stressed) academics tended to use. 1. They “time-block” their writing in advance Scheduling – booking in time to write in advance – was the single most common habit of our writers. It didn’t appear to matter what type of time-blocking method a scholar chose to use or how lengthy a writing session was. Some blocked out long periods of time on sabbatical, whilst others preferred to block out short, regular times throughout the day or across a week. What seemed to matter far more was the act of planning, as this mentally prepared the individual for writing – and so made the process easier and less stressful. “When I need to write I block out time. I’m lucky in that I can work from home – I block out a couple of straight days to do the writing and I plan it in beforehand. I couldn’t really write in any other way than blocking out that time.” According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Researchers found that writers who don't time-block their writing in advance probably: Options:  A. not enough information  B. Get all of their work done  C. Feel like they're stuck  D. Are more efficient than those that do time-block Answer:","output":"C. Feel like they're stuck"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury. Temperatures at the surface reach 465°C (860°F). That’s hot enough to melt lead!

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what do fires ignited with fuel convert energy into?\\" is \\"oil\\", given that  fires ignited with fuel convert energy into light and heat? The answer is:","output":"No, the right answer to the question \\"what do fires ignited with fuel convert energy into?\\" is not \\"oil\\". The reason is that when we talk about fires ignited with fuel, we are referring to the process of combustion. Combustion is a chemical reaction that involves the rapid combination of a fuel source with an oxidizer, such as oxygen, producing energy in the form of heat and light. This is also known as an exothermic reaction, as it releases energy. Given that the provided question asks about the energy conversion in a fire ignited with fuel, it would be incorrect to answer \\"oil\\" because oil is not a product of energy conversion in this context. Instead, the correct answer would be that fires ignited with fuel convert energy into heat and light, as stated in the original information provided. Heat and light energy produced by fires are crucial for various applications in our everyday lives, such as cooking, heating, and industrial processes. Heat energy generated during combustion can be harnessed to produce steam, which can power turbines and generate electricity in power plants. On a smaller scale, we utilize the heat produced by burning fuel to cook our food and warm our homes. Light energy produced during combustion can be seen as the visible glow created by burning materials. This glow, or flame, is a result of excited molecules and atoms releasing energy in the form of light photons. Light emitted by fire has been essential throughout human history, providing illumination before the invention of artificial lights. In summary, fires ignited with fuel do not convert energy into \\"oil\\"; they convert energy into heat and light. This energy release is essential for various human activities, from heating our homes to powering large-scale industries. Understanding how combustion works and the energy conversion processes involved helps us use fire responsibly and efficiently to meet our needs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Juliette Murray was, like me, a kid at school who got 5 “A”s, which in the West of Scotland put a certain degree of pressure on one’s shoulders to study either medicine or law. I studied European Law, and became a teacher - that's what a European Law degree does to you. She studied medicine and is today a practicing doctor, but the education bug is firmly rooted in what she chose to do next. Murray noticed that, particularly in her local area, fewer students were applying to study medicine than the population number would suggest should. Not only that, nationally the number of medical students dropping out after beginning their course of study is increasing. She wondered if we might we persuade a more representative cross section of the community to become doctors. She set about improving the opportunities for local youngsters, aged 14/5, at the time of their work experience choices. Existing work experience for those who want to gain an insight into the world of medical doctors is a sanitised course in an educational skills centre, where bored teenagers endlessly take each other’s blood pressure. They have more chance of a realistic insight by breaking their arm and turning up to Accident and Emergency. As any dad-to-be donning surgical greens knows, getting into an operating theatre is where a passion for surgery will be born or, in my case, definitely put to one side as a career option. So, the question became: how might we offer a more realistic experience of what being a doctor, surgeon or other medical profession feels like? Starting with her local hospital, Wishaw General in NHS Lanarkshire, she set about overcoming what she describes as a “culture of obstacles”. Two years later, though, and students are indeed undertaking real life surgery work experience, experiencing a live operation theatre and seeing the pressure of the job first hand.

This hands-on approach not only helps them develop a deeper appreciation for the profession but also allows them to discover whether their interests and passions align with a career in medicine. Moreover, by targeting a more diverse and representative group of students for these experiences, Juliette Murray's efforts contribute to broadening the pool of potential future doctors, which may ultimately lead to a more inclusive and effective healthcare system."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The composition of the male eye makes it sensitive to motion and direction. \\" Boys interpret  the world as objects moving through space,\\" he says. The male eye is also drawn to cooler color1s like silver and black. It's no accident that boys tend to create pictures of moving objects instead of drawing the happy color1ful family,as girls do in class. The female eye,on the other hand,is drawn to warmer color1s like red, yellow and orange. To attract girls, Chadwell says, the teacher doesn't need to move as much as in boys' class.

Rooftop beekeeper A recent Thursday: Spencer Marshall methodically zipped a white bee suit from his waist to his chin, then pulled a meshed hood over his head to protect himself from venomous harm. Only after he was all secure did he light a piece of burlap, put it in a tin smoker and start replacing the beehives in the rooftop garden at the Fairmont Hotel. Patrons of the hotel were none the wiser as thousands of bees swarmed the skyline just above Marshall’s head. It was business as usual for the hotel, for Marshall and for his bees. Marshall, 69, has worked with bees for 40 years and manages more than 500 hives in 70 locations all over the Bay Area. His organic honey operation, Marshall’s Farm Honey in American Canyon near Napa, produces more than 50,000 pounds of honey per year. He has a pretty good idea of what kind of conditions bees need to make copious amount of honey. You wouldn’t think the Fairmont roof would supply those conditions. Marshall himself was skeptical when the hotel’s chef asked him four years ago if he would bring some of his bees to the Nob Hill landmark to exchange for earmarking a modest amount of honey for the kitchen – 10 pounds a year per hive, to be exact. Still, he said OK. And last year, four double-queen hives atop the Fairmont produced more than 1,000 pounds of honey. “In this day and age,” Marshall said, “that’s unheard of.” “We’re right up here where the wind is always blowing … and all you see is concrete, asphalt and big huge high-rise buildings. You don’t see any fields of flowers,” Marshall said. “I really can’t explain it. The only thing I can think that makes sense to me is they have very little competition, and the weather must be just right for them.” Marshall comes from a long line of beekeepers. His great-grandmother raised hives in the Yellowstone area, and Marshall helped his grandmother work a few hives on the family farm in Lodi growing up. But bees and honey weren’t Marshall’s first vocational choice. As a young man he worked on television productions, taught and even did a stint as a carpenter, but nothing felt like the perfect fit. Then his father was paralyzed in a car accident, and Marshall came home to help run the corn and wheat farm. To keep his “sanity,” he said, he took up beekeeping as a hobby. “I kept doing bees, kept doing bees – and one day I asked myself, what’s wrong with bees?” he said. “It’s what I wanted to do. It’s what I read about; it’s what I thought about. It was like, oh yeah, this is it! I don’t have to search anymore.” Four decades and 35,000 stings later, he still loves it. “I’m almost like a doctor, where I’m going into the hive and figuring out what’s going on and what kind of help they need,” Marshall said. “You know, trying to make them stronger, healthier, more productive. “You’re not just punching a clock. You’re involved in something bigger than yourself.” What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of this text are: 1.

Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in- testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine. This organ consists of three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum.

Harris Allsworth (David Gurian) is their manager and Kelly's boyfriend. At the beginning of the film, Kelly gets the idea to relocate to the West Coast and look up her estranged Aunt Susan. It seems that Aunt Susan (Phyllis Davis) is holding a large inheritance that would have been shared with Kelly's mother, had she been alive. Kelly feels as if a share of this money could be hers, so the foursome sets out for Hollywood.Aunt Susan welcomes Kelly and her friends, and even promises a third of the fortune to Kelly, but Susan's sleazy financial advisor Porter Hall looks down on the girls, deeming them \\"hippies\\". Meanwhile, Susan introduces The Kelly Affair to a flamboyant and well-connected rock producer named Ronnie \\"Z-Man\\" Barzell (John LaZar), who urges the girls to give an impromptu performance at one of his outrageous parties. The number goes over so well that Z-Man takes the band under his wing, changing their name to The Carrie Nations, much to the chagrin of Harris.

We have this equation: -9364*w + 465351 - 72054 = 100826 - 203821 First, let's combine the numbers on each side of the equal sign.  On the left side, we have 465351 - 72054. If you do the subtraction, you get: 393297 - 9364*w On the right side, we have 100826 - 203821. If you do the subtraction, you get: -102995 Now, our equation looks like this: -9364*w + 393297 = -102995 Next, we want to isolate w (find out what w is). To do this, we will move the 393297 to the other side by subtracting it from both sides: -9364*w = -102995 - 393297 Now, we have: -9364*w = -496292 To find w, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -9364: w = -496292 / -9364 When you divide -496292 by -9364, you get: w = 53 So, the answer is w = 53."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I am living in a society where there are almost 90 houses and almost all of them are occupied. We have one sweeper hired for whole society to collect waste and sweep out dust from our society roads. BTW her name is Hira masi (my brother calls her diamond masi :p). And she is extremely poor and she lives in those slums where almost nothing is available. She earns 50/100 per house each month. (Source) As she is extremely poor, all the society people help her a lot. From giving 2 times food to giving clothes and giving bonuses on special occasion as much as Rs. 1000, they almost help her in each and every aspect. And this is by far the most incredible thing our society has which is humanity. But the twist comes here. On the other side, she is extremely cunning. She rarely cleans the road, takes rarely wastes from homes, gives excuses that she is sick and does not come for work, etc. She does not do her work properly. She also request money from us saying that her family members are ill as much as Rs 10000, even if they are not. So this thing was discussed in our meeting and there some decided to continue her as she was very poor and some decided to leave her. But my mom today told me a great thing- If a person is doing her work seriously, then we will surely help him in every way, even if it is a matter of money, but the person who is not sincere and not doing work properly, then sometimes we have to step back from humanity and be strict. If the person is honest and he is REALLY in need of help, we should definitely help them. But the person who just fakes that he is in need, we should be strict/ignore them, else they will not do any work, and just simply rely on us. Sometimes, being strict and giving up humanity will make the person grow. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Here is a news article: Image copyright Julia Quenzler Image caption Brady last appeared before a mental health tribunal in 2013      Moors Murderer Ian Brady has been refused permission to launch a High Court fight to have the lawyer of his choice represent him at a tribunal.      Brady, who lost a bid to move from a secure hospital to a prison at a mental health review in 2013, wanted to challenge a ban on Robin Makin representing him at a future tribunal.      Mr Makin's solicitors' firm, E Rex Makin & Co, is not a member of the Law Society's mental health panel.      The case was dismissed as \\"unarguable\\".      Sitting at London, Mr Justice Morris said Brady's challenge had \\"no realistic prospect of success\\".      He added that nothing in the European Convention on Human Rights or in case law \\"supports the proposition that in civil proceedings... there is a right to publicly-funded representation for a lawyer of choice\\".      Image caption Solicitor Robin Makin has represented Brady in the past      At the 2013 mental health review tribunal in Manchester, 79-year-old Brady asked to be moved to a Scottish prison from Merseyside's Ashworth Hospital so he could not be force-fed and could be allowed to die if he wishes.      The request was rejected after medical staff said Brady had chronic mental illness and needed continued care at the secure unit.      Brady refused to take part in a further review in September 2016 on the grounds that Mr Makin could not be involved.      Under legal aid rules, only members of the Law Society's mental health panel are entitled to a publicly-funded contract. ||||| Margaret Thatcher intervened to keep the Moors murderers in prison and dubbed their crimes “the most hideous and evil in modern times”, The Telegraph can reveal.      A new archived document never before seen in public has been uncovered showing the Tory prime minister demanding the killers stayed incarcerated for “ever”.      Mrs Thatcher also ordered extra security for Ian Brady when he was being transferred into a new prison “to make doubly sure that this maniac cannot escape”. ||||| Serial killer took action after his solicitor was denied legal aid contract to represent him in attempt to move to a Scottish prison      Moors murderer Ian Brady has been refused permission to launch a high court battle to get a lawyer of his choice to represent him at a tribunal.      Brady applied to launch what his lawyers described as a “totally unique” legal case after his solicitor of more than 25 years, Robin Makin, was denied a legal aid contract to represent him in his attempt to move to a Scottish prison.      In 2013, the serial killer, 79, who now uses the name Ian Stewart-Brady, appeared before the mental health review tribunal asking to be moved to a prison in Scotland – where he was born and brought up – so he would not be force fed and could be allowed to die. Scottish prisons do not force feed inmates.      His request to transfer was rejected after Ashworth hospital on Merseyside – where he is currently a patient – said he had chronic mental illness and needed continued care. A further review of the case was scheduled to take place in September last year, but Brady refused to take part unless his lawyer of choice could represent him.      Brady and Myra Hindley were convicted of luring children and teenagers to their deaths. The couple’s victims were sexually tortured before being buried on Saddleworth Moor. Hindley died in hospital, still a prisoner, in November 2002 at 60.      Makin is currently barred from acting as Brady’s publicly funded legal representative because his solicitors’ firm, E Rex Makin & Co, is not a member of the Law Society’s mental health panel. Under legal aid rules, only members are entitled to a publicly funded contract in the mental health law category.      After a hearing held in London last week, Justice Morris on Monday dismissed Brady’s application for permission to seek judicial review, ruling that it had “no realistic prospect of success”.      Morris said nothing in the European convention on human rights or in case law supported “the proposition that in civil proceedings, in particular proceedings related to detention on the grounds of mental health, there is a right to publicly funded representation for a lawyer of choice”.      Brady’s legal team, who say the prisoner has been bedridden for the last couple of years, argued that the lord chancellor, Liz Truss, should use her powers to “make arrangements” in the case because it was so unique. However, Morris said it would not be a “lawful and proper use of her power” for her to intervene.      Lawyers acting for Brady have described him as terminally ill. “He is in very poor physical health – he suffers from emphysema and has constant oxygen and a nebuliser four times a day,” they said. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"A man named Ian Brady, who did some very bad things a long time ago, wanted a certain lawyer to represent him at a special meeting called a tribunal. This lawyer, named Robin Makin, wasn't allowed to represent Brady because his law firm isn't part of a special group called the Law Society's mental health panel.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Tragic Accident Takes The Life of a Young Boy While Playing in the Garden Once upon a time, there was a young boy named Billy Hughes, who was 10 years old. He loved to play outside in his garden, just like many other kids do. But on a sad Monday, something really bad happened that made a lot of people very sad. Billy was playing on a rope swing in his garden. A rope swing is a fun thing that hangs from a tree and lets you swing back and forth. But while Billy was playing, he got caught in the rope and couldn't get free. This was a very dangerous and scary situation. Some people who help keep us safe, called the police, heard about what happened to Billy. They came as fast as they could to help, but sadly, they couldn't save him. Billy passed away, which means his body stopped working, and he won't be able to play or do anything anymore. When someone we care about passes away, it makes us feel very sad and we miss them a lot. The police are now trying to find out what exactly happened to Billy. They want to know why this accident happened and how it could have been so dangerous. They are going to look at Billy's body and try to learn more about what went wrong. This is called a post-mortem examination. It's like solving a puzzle to find out what happened when someone gets hurt really bad or passes away. It's important that we learn from this so that we can make sure other kids can play safely in their gardens. Every time we learn how to keep each other safe, it helps us avoid sad situations like what happened to Billy. So, even though we are very sad about what happened to Billy Hughes, we hope that by understanding how this accident happened, we can help keep other kids safe in the future.

Faryl Smith (born 23 July 1995) is a British soprano who rose to fame after appearing on the second series of the ITV television talent show Britain's Got Talent in 2008. She received praise throughout the competition, and although the favourite to win after the second round, she finished outside the top three in the live final on 31 May. During the competition, she was tutored by singing coach Yvie Burnett and received offers from various record labels. After the show, she, unlike other finalists, did not sign with Simon Cowell's Syco, although she did appear on fellow finalist Andrew Johnston's debut album, One Voice. In July 2009 it was announced that Smith was hoping to release her second album later in the year. In an interview, she expressed surprise and pleasure that the label wanted her to do another album so soon after the first. In September, further details about the album were released, including its name, Wonderland, and planned release date, 30 November. Smith claimed that Faryl \\"was an introduction to me and an introduction for me to recording\\", while Cohen, producer of both Faryl and Wonderland, said Smith had \\"matured as an artist since the first album and I have no doubt that once again, people will be astonished and moved by her performances\\". The album, which was recorded at Sarm Studios in Notting Hill, London, was completed in early October, and is loosely based on Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland. Wonderland was released on 30 November. To publicise the album, Smith appeared on numerous radio shows, as well as television appearances including Ready Steady Cook, Blue Peter, the BBC News Channel, The Alan Titchmarsh Show and Sky News Sunrise.  Wonderland was well received by critics; Paul Callan, reviewing the album for the Daily Express, described it as \\"a joy\\". He compared it to other Christmas albums, saying that \\"[t]oo many are tired, much-repeated carol selections.\\" He described Smith's \\"control, tone and warmth\\" as \\"very moving\\". Andy Gill, reviewing Wonderland for The Independent, gave a less positive review. He said that the influence of Alice in Wonderland was often hard to perceive and that Cohen and Smith had \\"sweetened the classical elements\\". However, he praised the arrangements of \\"Adiemus\\", \\"Barcarolle\\", \\"Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence\\" and \\"Blow The Wind Southerly\\", but noted that on tracks including \\"Close To You\\", \\"the lack of emotional weight is telling.\\" Overall, Gill gave Wonderland 3 out of 5. However, the album failed to perform as well as Faryl; it entered the British album charts at number 56 for the week ending 12 December before dropping to number 92 the following week and then out of the top 100. After Wonderland, Smith's contract with Universal ended, and she subsequently received less attention from the press. Smith described the break with the label as mainly her decision, as she needed to focus on her A levels, which would allow her to get to university, explaining in an interview that \\"It wasn't like it ended horribly.\\"  Smith performed at the 2009 Royal Variety Performance in front of Queen Elizabeth II, where she sang \\"God Save the Queen\\" with The Soldiers. She later said that the experience, including subsequently meeting the Queen, as the highlight of her year. Smith also performed elsewhere with The Soldiers, including at St Paul's Cathedral and Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital. What is the purpose of Wonderland?","output":"Wonderland is an album created by Faryl Smith, a British singer who became famous after participating in a TV show called Britain's Got Talent. The purpose of this album is to share her beautiful singing voice and her musical talents with people who enjoy listening to it. The album is inspired by a story called Alice in Wonderland and has songs that people can enjoy during the Christmas time. It's a way for Faryl to grow as an artist and a performer and for people to enjoy her music."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Researchers think it is a relative of the endangered South Asian river dolphin, offering clues to the evolutionary history of modern species. The findings have been published in the journal open access PeerJ. The fossil, a partial skull about 22cm (9ins) long, was discovered in southeastern Alaska by geologist Donald J Miller. It then spent decades in the collection of the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History in Washington DC. The dolphin swam in sub-arctic marine waters about 25 million years ago, according to the new study's authors Alexandra Boersma and Nicholas Pyenson, who are based at the Smithsonian. The specimen represents a new genus and species, they say, which has been named Arktocara yakataga. Based on the age of nearby rocks, the scientists estimated that Arktocara came from the late Oligocene epoch, around the time that ancient whales diversified into two groups - the baleen whales, which include blue whales and humpbacks, and the toothed whales, which include sperm whales, porpoises and dolphins. By studying the skull and comparing it to those of other dolphins, both living and extinct, the team determined that A. yakataga is a relative of the South Asian river dolphin Platanista. This living dolphin is the last survivor of a once-widespread group. The skull confirms that Platanista belongs to one of the oldest lineages of toothed whales still alive today. \\"One of the most useful ways we can study Platanista is... by looking at fossils that are related to it to try to get a better sense of where it's coming from,\\" said Ms Boersma. \\"Exactly how that once diverse and globally widespread group dwindled down to a single species in Southeast Asia is still somewhat a mystery, but every little piece that we can slot into the story helps.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"A very old extinct animal, which is like a special kind of dolphin, was discovered by looking at a skull that had been in a museum since 1951.

The Department of Energy grabs 21 million from Fisker Automotive The Fisker Karma has the looks of a Ferrari or Lamborghini, a celebrity clientele that includes Leonardo DiCaprio and teen heart-throb Justin Bieber, and much of the green-minded eco credential of a Toyota Prius. Yet the fate of this seductive plug-in hybrid sedan could soon have more in common with the departed DeLorean Motor Company, considering the automaker’s mounting financial problems.      Justin Bieber had his Fisker Karma chromed, and then pulled over by the Los Angeles police on at least two occasions. Yet financially troubled Silicon Valley-based Fisker Automotive needs much more than a celebrity-fueled jolt of publicity to get it out of its current predicament.      Burning cash and in desperate search for some form of automotive alliance – or someone to simply buy the company outright – Fisker finds itself in the crosshairs of the U.S. Department of Energy, which forcibly recovered 21 million as partial repayment of roughly 200 million worth of outstanding U.S. government loans.      PHOTOS: AMERICA'S GAS-FREE FUTURE      Those loans were part of an eco-themed initiative intended to boost fledgling companies with a dedicated green initiative. As reported by Reuters, Fisker presently owes the U.S. government about 192 million of the 529 million loan it received from the DOE in 2009.      That’s a big check to pay for any auto company, much less a boutique brand with one luxury-based model in its lineup. Granted, the high price of the Karma sedan narrows its overall sales pool but, much like the majority of A-list celebs, this plug-in hybrid doesn’t lack anything in the looks department.      RELATED: STEVEN TYLER SHOWS OFF HIS 1.1 MILLION HENNESSEY VENOM GT SPYDER      The Karma has the lines of a dedicated supercar, thanks to its wildly curvaceous fenders and ground-hugging stance – though some have suggested the front grille bears a striking resemblance to a waxed moustache. Under the curvaceous hood is a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine, coupled to a pair of electric motors which are powered by a lithium-ion battery pack.      The Karma is capable of running solely on electric power for approximately 30 miles and, once that point is reached, the gasoline-fed engine functions as an onboard generator for a total driving range of 230 miles.      RELATED: SOCCER STAR CRISTIANO RONALDO'S DAMAGED FERRARI SET TO SELL ON EBAY      Fisker prefers to quote the EPA’s combined gasoline and electric-only driving formula of 52 MPGe. Yet when functioning purely in gas-powered format, the Karma’s 20-mpg average is not even half of that impressive sounding figure.      The company had hoped to introduce a smaller, cheaper model called the Atlantic, along with variations of the Karma that included a gorgeous convertible and sleek station-wagon. These plans, along with the fate of the entire company, are now on exceedingly shaky ground. ||||| Article Excerpt      For a few months in 2012, Bruce Simon, the chief executive of gourmet food retailer Omaha Steaks International Inc., drove a 100,000 plug-in hybrid electric car known as the Fisker Karma. No longer.      Mr. Simon says his car broke down four times over the span of a few months. Each time, Fisker Automotive Inc. picked it up and sent it by trailer from his home in Omaha, Neb., to a dealer in Minneapolis.      The Karma was \\"so vulnerable to software errors, and the parts used were of such poor quality that eventually I insisted they take the car back and ... ||||| Newly released documents show that the Obama administration was warned as early as 2010 that electric car maker Fisker Automotive Inc. was not meeting milestones set up for a half-billion-dollar government loan, nearly a year before U.S. officials froze the loan after questions were raised about the company's statements.      An Energy Department official said in a June 2010 email that Fisker's bid to draw on the federal loan might be jeopardized for failure to meet goals established by the Energy Department.      Despite that warning, Fisker continued to receive money until June 2011, when the DOE halted further funding. The agency did so after Fisker presented new information that called into question whether key milestones _ including launch of the company's signature, 100,000 Karma hybrid _ had been achieved, according to a credit report prepared by the Energy Department.      The December 2011 credit report said \\"DOE staff asked questions about the delays\\" in the launch of the Karma \\"and received varied and incomplete explanations,\\" leading to the suspension of the loan. Fisker had received a total of 192 million of the 529 million loan before it was suspended.      In the June 2010 email, Sandra Claghorn, an official in DOE's loan program office, had written that Fisker \\"may be in limbo due to a lack of compliance with financial covenants\\" set up by the Energy Department to protect taxpayers in the event of default. Another document, from April 2010, listed milestones that Fisker had not yet met.      Aoife McCarthy, a spokeswoman for the Energy Department, said the June 2010 email was taken out of context.      \\"The document shows that one person at a meeting discussed the possibility that Fisker might not meet a financial commitment\\" required by the Energy Department, McCarthy said in an email late Tuesday. DOE received the needed certification five days later and subsequently made the loan payment, she said.      The Associated Press obtained the Fisker documents ahead of a House hearing scheduled for Wednesday on the federal loan to the troubled car maker, which has laid off three-fourths of its workers amid continuing financial and production problems.      The potential loss of 171 million would be largest loss of federal loan money since the 2011 failure of solar panel maker Solyndra, which declared bankruptcy and laid off all its workers after receiving a 528 million loan from the Energy Department.      The Energy Department seized 21 million from Fisker this month as it continued to seek repayment from the car maker for the 2009 loan. A payment from Fisker was due Monday, but was not made, a DOE official said.      Henrik Fisker, the company's namesake and founder, was scheduled to testify at Wednesday's hearing. Fisker, who was forced out as CEO as the company's troubles mounted, said in prepared testimony that he remained proud of the company's \\"cutting edge technology,\\" which he said could \\"pave the way for a new generation of American car manufacturing.\\"      Fisker has not built a vehicle since last summer and has failed to secure a buyer as its cash reserves have dwindled.      ___      Follow Matthew Daly on Twitter: https://twitter.com/MatthewDalyWDC ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The Fisker Karma, a plug-in hybrid sedan with a celebrity clientele that includes Leonardo DiCaprio and Justin Bieber, has found itself in financial turmoil.

Washington's introduction to surveying began at an early age through school exercises that taught him the basics of the profession, followed by practical experience in the field. His first experiences at surveying occurred in the territory surrounding Mount Vernon. His first opportunity as a surveyor occurred in 1748 when he was invited to join a survey party organized by his neighbor and friend George Fairfax of Belvoir. Fairfax organized a professional surveying party to lay out large tracts of land along the border of western Virginia, where Washington gained invaluable experience in the field.  Washington began his professional career in 1749 at the age of 17, when he was appointed county surveyor of Culpeper County, Virginia. He subsequently received a commission and surveyor's license from the College of William & Mary. He completed his first survey in less than two days, plotting a 400-acre parcel of land. He was subsequently able to purchase land in the Shenandoah Valley, the first of his many land acquisitions in western Virginia.  For the next four years, Washington worked surveying land in Western Virginia for the Ohio Company, a land investment company funded by Virginia investors. He came to the notice of the new lieutenant governor of Virginia Robert Dinwiddie, thanks to Lawrence's position as commander of the Virginia militia. In October 1750, Washington resigned his position as an official surveyor, though he continued to survey professionally for two more years before receiving a military appointment as adjutant for southern Virginia. By 1752, Washington completed close to 200 surveys on numerous properties totaling more than 60,000 acres. He continued to survey at different times throughout his life and as late as 1799.

The premise is like a starting idea or fact, which here tells us a man is riding large waves on a wind sail. The hypothesis is like a guess or prediction, which in this case says that a woman will also ride large waves on a wind sail. Now the question is, can we say that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true? Hmmm. Let's think about it. Just because we know a man is riding large waves on a wind sail (premise), it doesn't automatically mean a woman is doing the same thing (hypothesis). They are two separate ideas without any proof that show they are both true together. So, we cannot say for sure that the hypothesis is true just because the premise is true. We would need more details or information to be certain if a woman is also riding large waves on a wind sail.

Question: Which was the second bridge to be built over the Thames in central London? Answer:","output":"The second bridge to be built over the River Thames in central London was the Blackfriars Bridge, whose construction was officially completed in 1769. However, before diving into its details, it is important to note that the very first bridge, known as the London Bridge, was initially a wooden bridge built by the Romans in the first century AD. Over time, it went through several reconstructions and modifications, eventually becoming a stone bridge that stood as the sole pathway across the river for over a millennium. However, during the 18th century, due to growing population, urbanization and the expansion of businesses, there was a rising need for another bridge as the London Bridge became insufficient to handle the increased flow of people and goods. As a result, discussions and proposals for a new bridge at Blackfriars began. The name \\"Blackfriars\\" stems from the historic presence of the Dominican monastery, also called \\"Blackfriars,\\" which had been a focal point of the area in the medieval period. The attire of the Dominican order and their robes had a black mantle or cloak, hence the name \\"Black Friars.\\" The bridge was to be constructed as an access point between the expanding areas of Blackfriars and the City of London on the north side and the growing borough of Southwark on the south side. The Blackfriars Bridge was designed by architect Robert Mylne, who won a competition held to select the best possible design for the new bridge. Mylne's design was an elegant, somewhat elliptical structure with nine semi-elliptical arches of Portland stone, which was commissioned by the City Corporation. The construction process was relatively smooth, though the engineers faced technical challenges, such as constructing strong foundation bases on the shifting soil and clay around the riverbed. To overcome these challenges, they used innovative engineering techniques of that time, including the use of timber piles that were driven into the riverbed to provide sufficient support. The bridge officially opened to the public in 1769, and its formal name was the William Pitt Bridge, named after Britain's prime minister, though the name \\"Blackfriars Bridge\\" became more widely used and is what it is still known as today. The bridge not only significantly improved the connectivity within London, but it also served as a symbol of technological and engineering advancements of its time. It became an important transportation hub and fostered economic growth, commercial expansion, and increased accessibility for London residents and travelers. However, the original bridge faced issues due to its deteriorating condition and weakening structure as it aged. As a result, in 1860, a new iron bridge designed by engineer Joseph Cubitt was constructed to replace the original stone bridge. The new Blackfriars Bridge, completed in 1869, was sturdier and wider than its predecessor, with five cast-iron arches that spanned a total length of 923 feet. This new bridge is the one that stands today, and it remains a crucial transportation link in central London, with its nearest neighbors being the modern Millennium Bridge and the Southwark Bridge, all spanning across the mighty River Thames."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Tories making 'monumental mistake' with lopsided cuts, says Nick Clegg Nick Clegg has warned that George Osborne is in danger of making a \\"monumental mistake\\" after the chancellor said that about half of a further £25bn in spending cuts after the next general election would come from the welfare budget. In a sign of how coalition relations will remain fractious until the election in May 2015, the deputy prime minister said the chancellor's plans to target cuts on the working age poor were lopsided and unbalanced. Speaking at his monthly press conference in Whitehall, Clegg said: \\"You've got a Conservative party now who are driven, it seems to me, by two very clear ideological impulses. One is to remorselessly pare back the state – for ideological reasons just cut back the state. \\"Secondly – and I think they are making a monumental mistake in doing so – they say the only people in society, the only section in society, which will bear the burden of further fiscal consolidation are the working-age poor.\\" Signalling how he will waste no time in lambasting Tory plans over the next 16 months, Clegg later added: \\"I literally don't know of a serious economist who believes that you only do it from that lopsided, unbalanced approach. Almost all, serious economists say you have some kind of mix.\\" The deputy prime minister criticised his cabinet colleague after the chancellor warned of a further £25bn of cuts after the next electionthe chancellor warned of a further £25bn of cuts after the next election, targeting council housing for the better-off and housing benefit for under-25s. In a grim message to start the new year, Osborne said Britain was facing a year of hard truths in 2014 as there were more cuts to make and the economy still had big underlying problems. He said he expected the biggest chunk of the savings – around £12bn – to come from welfare in the two years after the election, as it would be an odd choice to leave this \\"enormous budget … untouched\\". Benefits for the young and people of working age would be considered before any cuts to pensioner benefits such as free bus passes and television licences, the chancellor said. The move forms part of Osborne's pledge to run a budget surplus by 2019 if the Conservatives are returned to power at the next election. The Treasury spends £1.9bn on housing benefit for 350,000 people under the age of 25, of whom about half have dependent children. In a speech in the Midlands on Monday morning, Osborne said there was still a long way to go before recovery as he set out a five-point plan to help the economy. \\"We've got to make more cuts – £17bn this coming year, £20bn next year, and over £25bn further across the two years after. That's more than £60bn in total.\\" Osborne built on previous warnings about the need to intensify austerity, on top of billions of pounds of existing cuts, even though the economy appears to be turning a corner. In the speech, he said the job of fixing the economy was \\"not even half done\\". \\"That's why 2014 is the year of hard truths,\\" he said. Clegg has agreed spending plans with Osborne for the first year after the general election and a target to eliminate the budget structural deficit by 2017-18. But in a taste of one of the main election battles – over the means by which the deficit should be cut – Clegg said it was wrong of the chancellor only to highlight the welfare bill for cuts, although Osborne did not say that the proposed £25bn savings would all come from welfare savings. Clegg also said the chancellor was wrong to play down the need for further tax rises. The deputy prime minister said: \\"Where the British people want a future British government to be is in the liberal centre ground where you say, yes of course, you need to finish the job of clearing the decks fiscally, of completing the job of filling the black hole – the so-called structural deficit – by the financial year 2017-18. To that extent the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives are co-authors of fiscal responsibility in setting out that timetable and that plan. \\"But – here is the big difference with the Conservatives – we believe the way in which you finish that job should be done fairly. \\"There are different ways in which you do that. There is Whitehall waste in spending which you continue to bear down on. There is of course further welfare reform, which will always be driven by the need to sharpen the incentives to work. And, yes, there is asking people with the broadest shoulders to make a contribution. That is why I remain perplexed that the Conservatives still refuse to countenance any change in the tax system to ask people occupying very high value properties to make a small, additional contribution to this effort.\\" Clegg's remarks show that the Liberal Democrat manifesto for the next election will include a \\"mansion tax\\" on properties worth more than £2m. But the Lib Dems will also include the \\"triple lock\\" on pensions – increasing them annually in line with inflation, average earnings or 2.5%, whichever is highest. David Cameron said on Sunday that the Tories would guarantee the triple lock, one of the main features of the Lib Dem manifesto in 2010, until 2020. The chancellor's negative outlook forms part of his argument that people should vote Conservative to let the party \\"finish the job\\", rather than handing control back to Labour. However, Labour said more cuts were needed after 2015 because Osborne's \\"failure on growth and living standards since 2010 has led to his failure to balance the books\\". Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, said the social security bill was rising under Osborne, but the best way to get it down for the long-term is to get people into work and build more homes. \\"The Tories should back our compulsory jobs guarantee for young people and the long-term unemployed. And in tough times it cannot be a priority to continue paying the winter fuel allowance to the richest five per cent of pensioners,\\" he said. \\"What we need is Labour's plan to earn our way to higher living standards for all, tackle the cost-of-living crisis and get the deficit down in a fairer way.\\"","output":"Nick Clegg, a big leader in the UK, said that another big leader, George Osborne, might make a really big mistake. Osborne wants to make more cuts to the country's spending, which means they will spend less money on certain things. Clegg thinks it's not fair because the people who will be affected the most are the working-age poor. Osborne believes the UK still has big problems in its economy, even though things are getting a little better. But Clegg thinks there should be other ways to fix these problems without making things too hard for certain people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What was the name of the person who Chafe concluded their party had not reached the island? is inside the article: Bartlett decided to send a team back to establish the exact location of the island that the Anderson party had approached, and to determine if Anderson had actually landed there. An injury to his knee ruled Mamen out from this mission, which was undertaken by ship's steward Ernest Chafe, with the Inuit pair, Kataktovik and Kuraluk. Chafe's group came within 2 miles (3 km) of Herald Island before being stopped by open water. A careful examination through binoculars revealed no signs of the missing party, and Chafe concluded that Anderson and company had not reached the island. Chafe and his party then returned to Shipwreck Camp.Meanwhile, on 4 February, Mackay and his group (Murray and Beuchat, joined by seaman Stanley Morris) announced they were leaving the next day, to seek land. Mackay presented Bartlett with a letter dated 1 February that began: \\"We, the undersigned, in consideration of the present critical situation, desire to make an attempt to reach the land.\\" The letter requested appropriate supplies, and concluded by emphasising that the journey was on their own initiative and absolving Bartlett from all responsibilities. Bartlett allocated them a sledge, a tent, six gallons of oil, a rifle and ammunition and food for 50 days. They left on 5 February; the last sighting of them was a few days later, by Chafe and the Inuit, returning from their abortive trip to Herald Island. They found Mackay's party struggling to make headway, with some of their provisions lost and clothing and other equipment discarded to lighten their load. Beuchat in particular was in a distressed state, nearly delirious and in the throes of hypothermia. However, the party refused assistance and rejected Chafe's pleas that they return with him to Shipwreck Camp. Thereafter the only hint of their fate was a sailor's scarf belonging to Morris, later found buried in an ice floe. It was assumed that the four had either been crushed by the ice, or had fallen through it., can you guess it ?

Answer the following question: My daughter went to see The Wild One recently and she commented that Marlon Brando was wearing jeans so long ago. Of course he helped set the trend, so that got me thinking about the link between films and trends in fashion. Fashion and films have gone hand in hand for long. The Wild One is a good example: it appeared in 1954, starring Brando. Dressed in a black leather motorcycle jacket, leather cap and jeans, he created a look which is still considered \\"cool\\" today. Everyone from Madonna to middle-aged men is seen wearing the classic leather motorcycle jacket. Another strong influence on fashion trends was Breakfast at Tiffany's, starring Audrey Hepburn. She made famous the simple black dress that looks perfect at either a cocktail party or just standing around an expensive department store like Tiffany's with a pastry and coffee in your hand, as Audrey Hepburn does in the film. She looks so elegant, wearing simple but beautiful dresses, big dark glasses and a string of pearls around her neck. Audrey Hepburn still influences women's fashion with her \\"Tiffany's look\\". In more modern times, the film star Uma Thurman created a major fashion trend when she appeared in the film Pulp Fiction, made in 1994. Her style was very simple. Her black trousers, crisp white shirt and hair style was copied by women in the world. Influencing fashion trends can often be about timing. The movie Memoirs of a Geisha came just in time to start a trend in Japanese fashion. It started the Chinese actress Zhang Ziyi, who wore beautiful silk kimonos , and it won an Oscar for Costume Design. Many travel companies picked up on the trend and ran \\"geisha trips\\" to Japan. The film has also led to a regained interest in kimonos. It is now quite common to see young Japanese women wearing kimonos not just on traditional occasions, but at various social events. The fashion is also beginning to spread to western countries. What does the film Memoirs of a Geisha lead to? A) The popularity of the Chinese actress. B) The worldwide reading of Geisha stories. C) The recovery of interest in kimonos. D) The \\"geisha trips\\" to social events. Answer:","output":"C) The recovery of interest in kimonos."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Coming off a divisional win at home over the Bills, the Patriots traveled to Paul Brown Stadium for a matchup with the Bengals. On the game's opening drive, the Patriots drove 66&#160;yards on 11 plays, stalling at the Bengals' 13-yard line before Gostkowski hit a 31-yard field goal. The Bengals' next drive would span five plays but only one yard, ending in a punt. After an exchange of punts, the Patriots began a drive from their own 35-yard line, but quickly advanced into Bengals territory on a 49-yard Morris run. Three plays later, Brady hit Vrabel on a 1-yard touchdown pass to extend the Patriots lead to 10-0. After a Bengals punt on the first play of the second quarter, the Patriots had the ball but found themselves in a 3rd-and-23 situation, when Brady was intercepted by Leon Hall at the Bengals' 35-yard line. The Bengals capitalized on the turnover, with Carson Palmer ending a five-play drive on a 1-yard touchdown pass to T. J. Houshmandzadeh. The Patriots responded by going on a 12-yard, 62-yard drive, finishing it with a 7-yard Moss touchdown reception, putting the Patriots ahead 17-7. The Bengals managed to reach the Patriots' 20-yard line on their next possession, but a Samuel interception at the 2-yard line kept the Bengals from scoring at the end of the first half. The Bengals reached midfield on the opening drive of the third quarter before punting. From their own 19-yard line, the Patriots moved deep in Bengals territory after a 15-yard penalty was tacked onto a 16-yard Moss catch. A few plays later, Morris ran for his second touchdown of the night; the 7-yard run opened the Patriots lead to 24-7. The Bengals, though, continued to threaten the Patriots offensively, moving to the Patriots' 22-yard line before linebacker Tedy Bruschi tipped a third-down pass to force a 40-yard Shayne Graham field goal. The Patriots next drive spanned into the fourth quarter but a Morris run on third down from the Bengals' 13-yard line was stopped for a loss, setting up a 36-yard Gostkowski field goal. Yet again, the Bengals moved into Patriots territory on their ensuing drive, but the Patriots defense prevented another touchdown and forced a 48-yard field goal, making the score 27-13. On the Patriots' next drive, a 23-yard Stallworth catch put the Patriots in Bengals territory, setting up a 14-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Moss. Down 34-13, the Bengals continued to move the ball with a 17-yard Houshmandzadeh catch on the next play, but Palmer's next pass attempt was intercepted by Randall Gay at the Patriots' 47-yard line.

Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis.

Step 1: Background information on NHS 24 - Briefly explain what NHS 24 is and its objectives (to provide round-the-clock health and medical advice to the public in the United Kingdom) - Highlight the critical role it plays in supporting people during emergencies and the responsibility it holds to provide accurate, effective guidance and support  Step 2: Overview of the incident - Present a brief summary of the tragic incident in question (a distressed woman contacted NHS 24 for assistance, but after the call, she took her own life) Step 3: Watchdog's criticism on NHS 24's handling of the call - Discuss the public services watchdog's findings, which condemn the actions taken by NHS 24 during the phone call - Detail the ways in which NHS 24's response was deemed inappropriate or inadequate in this situation (e.g., insufficient support or guidance provided to the distressed woman) Step 4: Impact of the criticism and incident on public trust - Examine the potential consequences of this incident (e.g., if it erodes public trust in NHS 24 and its ability to effectively address mental health issues) - Emphasize the importance of maintaining the public's faith in national healthcare services, especially during times of mental health crisis Step 5: Importance of addressing mental health concerns - Discuss the rising prevalence of mental health issues and their impact on society - Emphasize the need for effective mental health support systems and swift access to appropriate care Step 6: Recommendations for improvement - Offer recommendations on how NHS 24 and similar helpline services can better address mental health concerns (e.g., implementing more rigorous training for call handlers, streamlining protocols) - Encourage public health officials to continually review and update mental health care practices and policies Conclusion: The public services watchdog's criticism of NHS 24's handling of a distressed woman's call serves as a stark reminder of the crucial role emergency helplines play in our society. As mental health concerns continue to impact countless lives, it is essential that public health services are held accountable for their actions and strive to improve their support systems to ensure that those in need are effectively guided and assisted. With appropriate measures in place, organizations like NHS 24 can regain public trust and work tirelessly to prevent further tragedies from occurring."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Waves of energy radiate out from an earthquake’s focus. These waves are called seismic waves ( Figure below ). Seismic waves go different speeds through different materials. They change speed when they go from one type of material to another. This causes them to bend. Some seismic waves do not travel through liquids or gases. They just stop. Scientists use information from seismic waves to understand what makes up the Earth’s interior.  and the situation: A team of geologists studied two islands. Large island had a lot of seismic activity, and Small island that presented almost no seismic activity.  Answer the following question: Which island displayed fewer seismic waves? Answer:","output":"Based on the given background and situation, the island that displayed fewer seismic waves is Small island.  This conclusion is drawn from the information that Small island presented almost no seismic activity, which indicates that fewer seismic waves were generated and observed in comparison to Large island. Seismic activity is directly related to the presence of seismic waves, as these waves of energy radiate out from an earthquake's focus. As Large island had a lot of seismic activity, it can be inferred that there was a higher number of seismic waves associated with the earthquakes occurring on and around the island. The study of seismic waves helps geologists to understand Earth's interior and the composition of different materials beneath the surface. On Large island, with more seismic activity, geologists would have access to more data through the analysis of numerous seismic waves, enabling them to better comprehend the island's geological composition and potentially gain insights into the reasons for its increased seismic activity. On the other hand, Small island's lack of noticeable seismic activity would result in fewer seismic waves for geologists to analyze. This could make it more challenging to study the island's interior structure and composition based on seismic wave data alone. However, the absence of considerable seismic activity might also suggest a more stable geological framework beneath Small island or different geological processes occurring in comparison to Large island. In summary, Small island displayed fewer seismic waves due to its minimal seismic activity, providing geologists with less information to study the inner structure of the island compared to Large island, which exhibited abundant seismic activity and consequently a higher number of seismic waves."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The statement mentions five states - Nebraska, Kansas, Texas, North Dakota, and Minnesota - with large Czech American communities where Czech is commonly spoken at home. These states have a historical connection to the Czech immigration wave during the late 1800s and early 1900s when a significant number of people from the former Czechoslovakia moved to the United States in search of better opportunities, especially in farming. In Nebraska, there is a community known as \\"Czech Capital of the U.S.\\" in the town of Wilber, which hosts the annual Czech Days festival. Similarly, in Kansas, the town of Wilson holds a festival known as \\"Czech Fest\\" each year. In Texas, the town of West is known for its Czech heritage, with a significant percentage of the population claiming Czech ancestry. North Dakota has a relatively smaller Czech community; however, certain counties have a notable Czech-speaking population.

Available choices:  *No.  *Yes. Answer:","output":"No. The suggested answer \\"Raster to vector, an image conversion process\\" is not an accurate or comprehensive response to the question about \\"what is raster wiki.\\" It seems to be addressing a specific process involved in converting raster images to vector images, rather than focusing on the concept of raster images or explaining what raster wiki is. A more detailed and accurate answer would be: A raster image, also known as a bitmap, is a digital image represented by a grid of individual pixels or points of color. The term \\"raster\\" is derived from the process of scanning cathode ray tube (CRT) displays, which scan horizontally across the display to create images by varying the intensity of the electron beam. In the context of digital images, raster refers to the manner in which image data is stored and displayed, with each pixel having its own color value. Raster images are widely used in digital photography, video games, and graphic design due to their ability to represent complex and detailed images. However, raster images are resolution-dependent, which means that their quality can deteriorate when scaled up or down. This is because the pixel grid has a fixed size, and resizing the image requires new pixels to be interpolated, or guessed, based on the surrounding pixels. Raster wiki might refer to the concept of raster graphics from a Wiki source such as Wikipedia or another collaborative, user-edited platform. In this case, you can find information on raster graphics, their characteristics, and their applications in digital imaging. Depending on the wiki platform, you might also learn about file formats associated with raster images, such as JPEG, PNG, and GIF, as well as software programs that enable users to work with raster images like Adobe Photoshop and GIMP."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As a result, the character is still in a transition period--he is not drawn as elongated as he later was and his voice isn't quite right. In addition, the chemistry between Elmer and Bugs is a little unusual. Elmer is some poor sap who buys Bugs from a pet shop--there is no gun or desire on his part to blast the bunny to smithereens! However, despite this, this is still a very enjoyable film. The early Bugs was definitely more sassy and cruel than his later incarnations. In later films, he messed with Elmer, Yosimite Sam and others because they started it--they messed with the rabbit. But, in this film, he is much more like Daffy Duck of the late 30s and early 40s--a jerk who just loves irritating others!! A true \\"anarchist\\" instead of the hero of the later cartoons. While this isn't among the best Bug Bunny cartoons, it sure is fun to watch and it's interesting to see just how much he's changed over the years. What is the sentiment of this review?

What is the best way to: placemat","output":"The best way to create and use placemats, whether you're designing them for a special occasion or for everyday use, involves considering the various aspects of placemats and following certain guidelines to achieve the desired aesthetics and functionality. Here's a comprehensive guide to help you understand, design, and utilize placemats effectively: 1. Determine the purpose: First, establish the primary purpose of the placemats. Are they intended for a special event, a specific theme, or everyday use? This will help you choose appropriate colors, materials, and designs to either match or enhance your table setting. 2. Choose the right material: Placemats are made from a variety of different materials, such as linen, cotton, vinyl, bamboo, paper, silicone, or cork. Each material has its own pros and cons:    - Linen and cotton: These natural fiber options are soft, absorbent, and eco-friendly. They may be more suitable for formal settings or special occasions, as they have a more luxurious feel. They are also machine-washable and reusable.    - Vinyl, silicone, and other synthetic materials: These are ideal for casual and outdoor settings, as they're easy to clean, waterproof, and usually stain-resistant. However, they can become damaged when exposed to high temperatures.    - Bamboo and cork: Both materials offer a unique, natural look and are environmentally friendly. Bamboo placemats tend to be easy to clean with a damp cloth, while cork placemats provide a non-slip surface and heat resistance. 3. Consider size and shape: The standard placemat size is about 12x18 inches for rectangular or oblong placemats. However, placemats also come in round, square, and oval shapes to suit various table sizes and settings. Measure your table and ensure that the chosen placemat dimensions fit comfortably, leaving enough space between each setting. 4. Design and aesthetics: Whether you opt for solid colors, patterns, or themed designs, ensure that your chosen placemats complement your table setting, tableware, and overall décor. Consider the color scheme, textures, and styles of your dining area, and select placemats that either harmonize or contrast effectively with these elements. 5. Durability and maintenance: Opt for durable materials that can withstand regular wear and tear, especially if using them daily. It's also necessary to choose placemats that are easy to clean and maintain, saving you time and effort in the long run. 6. Layering and coordination: If desired, consider layering your placemats with coordinating elements such as tablecloths, chargers, and table runners. Layering adds depth, dimension, and visual interest to the table setting. 7. Proper placement: Place the placemats at each seat, typically one inch away from the table's edge, ensuring each guest has enough space to eat comfortably. Besides reflecting your style preferences, proper placement helps protect the table surface from spills, scratches, and heat. 8. Matching accessories: For a more cohesive look, consider coordinating your placemats with matching or complementary napkins, napkin rings, and tableware. This helps to create harmony and balance within the table setting. In conclusion, the best way to create and use placemats involves determining their purpose, choosing the right materials and size, considering the design and aesthetics, focusing on durability and maintenance, layering and coordinating when desired, placing them correctly, and accessorizing to create a cohesive look. By following these guidelines, you can ensure a visually appealing and functional placemat experience for any occasion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On 10 November 1509, Pizarro sailed from Spain to the New World with Alonso de Ojeda on an expedition to Uraba. He sailed to Cartagena and joined the fleet of Martin Fernandez de Enciso and, in 1513, accompanied Balboa to the Pacific. In 1514, he found a supporter in Pedro Arias Davila, the Governor of Castilla de Oro and was rewarded for his role in the arrest of Balboa with the positions of mayor and magistrate in Panama City, serving from 1519 to 1523.  Reports of Peru's riches and Cortes's success in Mexico tantalized Pizarro. He undertook two expeditions to conquer the Incan Empire in 1524 and in 1526. Both failed as a result of native hostilities, bad weather and lack of provisions.  Pedro de los Rios, the Governor of Panama, made an effort to recall Pizarro, but the conquistador resisted and remained in the south. In April 1528, he reached northern Peru and found the natives rich with precious metals. This discovery gave Pizarro the motivation to plan a third expedition to conquer the area. He returned to Panama to make arrangements, but the Governor refused to grant permission for the project. Pizarro returned to Spain to appeal directly to King Charles I. His plea was successful and he received not only a license for the proposed expedition, but also authority over any lands conquered during the venture. He was joined by family and friends and the expedition left Panama in 1530.  When hostile natives along the coast threatened the expedition, Pizarro moved inland and founded the first Spanish settlement in Peru, San Miguel de Piura. Atahualpa refused to tolerate a Spanish presence in his lands, but was captured by Pizarro during the Battle of Cajamarca on 16 November 1532. A ransom for the emperor's release was demanded and Atahualpa filled a room with gold, but Pizarro charged him with various crimes and executed him on 26 July 1533, overriding his associates who thought he was overstepping his authority. The same year, Pizarro entered the Inca capital of Cuzco and completed his conquest of Peru. In January 1535, Pizarro founded the city of Lima, a project he considered his greatest achievement. Quarrels between Pizarro and his longtime comrade-in-arms Diego Almagro culminated in the Battle of Las Salinas. Almagro was captured and executed and, on 26 June 1541, his embittered son, Diego de Almagro \\"el mozo\\", assassinated Pizarro in Lima. The conquistador of Peru was laid to rest in the Lima Cathedral.

Q:David Gauntlett makes a good point in his newest book (Making Media Studies: The Creativity Turn in Media and Communications Studies) and that is that traditional forms of media studies are no longer applicable. Gone are the days of massive institutions and production companies, gone are the traditional audiences and simplistic texts. In, is the new age media companies, the everyday media makers, the consistent consumers and the fantastical mess of The WWW. While universities are pumping out the same content areas since the 1980’s (e.g. institutions, production, audiences and texts) that are only relevant to a handful of media forms (cinema, television, online broadcasting and publications), the rest of the world is moving on. David Gauntlett so rightly says that creativity in media, should also refer to thinking creatively about the subject. What are the new ways of running media and communication studies? How has the subject itself changed? What approaches and methods can help media and communications studies to become innovative and useful in spheres beyond itself? David Gauntlett encourages a kind of call to arms, an acquiescence of the incapacities of the old system and a redirected gaze to the future needs of media students and media studies programs. Inspired by Tim Ingold’s book Making, David believes media studies should have making at it’s front and centre. He also believes the ability to do things with media should be embraced over and above the ability to talk about what others do with media, or what media does to us. The notion is that media studies should be hands on, that it should be all about ideas and critical engagement and this should be expressed through actual making. To borrow three key distinctions from the anthropologist Tim Ingold: 1. It’s about learning WITH media rather than ABOUT media. 2. There is an intent to move FORWARD rather than looking BACKWARDS at how things are. 3. It’s aims are TRANSFORMATIONAL rather than DOCUMENTARY.

This article: Blender described Jackson as the \\"late 20th century's preeminent pop icon\\", while The New York Times gave the opinion that he was a \\"musical phenomenon\\" and that \\"in the world of pop music, there is Michael Jackson and there is everybody else\\". Jackson changed the way the industry functioned: both as an artistic persona and as a financial, profitable entity. His attorney John Branca observed that Jackson achieved the highest royalty rate in the music industry to that point: approximately 2 (US4.82 in 2018 dollars) for each album sold. As a result, Jackson earned record-breaking profits from compact disc sales and from the sale of copies of the documentary, The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller, produced by Jackson and John Landis. Funded by MTV, the film sold over 350,000 copies in its first few months. In a market then driven by singles, Thriller raised the significance of albums, yet its multiple hit singles changed perceived notions as to the number of successful singles that could be taken from an individual album. The era saw the arrival of novelties like the Michael Jackson doll, that appeared in stores in May 1984 at a price of 12 (US29 in 2018 dollars). Thriller retains a position in American culture; biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli explains, \\"At some point, Thriller stopped selling like a leisure item—like a magazine, a toy, tickets to a hit movie—and started selling like a household staple\\".At the time of the album's release, a press statement from Gil Friesen, the then President of A&M Records, read that, \\"The whole industry has a stake in this success\\".

A Washington state grandmother could lose an eye after she bravely rescued her grandson who was being viciously attacked by an otter as he swam in a river on Thursday. Roxane Leilani Grove's grandmotherly instinct kicked in as soon as she heard the screams of her 8-year-old grandson, Bryce Moser, and then saw the horrible sight of an otter biting him aggressively in a swimming hole in the Pilchuck River - about 30 miles northeast of Seattle. 'I could see that it was biting into his head and it had its claws around him,' Grove told KOMO News. Scroll down for video. Attacked: Roxane Leilani Grove and her grandson Bryce Moser, left, with their injuries from an otter attack at Pilchuck River, Washington. 'I just. swam out there and I grabbed the claws to pull it off of him. 'I just remember trying to hold it as tight as I can and yelling \\"Get. him out of the water! Get him out of the water!\\"' Grove managed to get young Bryce out of the water but not before suffering her own injuries. 'It just started biting on me and biting on me and it felt like little knives just going in,' Grove told the TV station. The. pair were taken to a hospital where Grove reportedly received hundreds. of stitches to her face and head as well as the eye injury and Bryce. received nine staples in his head. State. and federal wildlife agents in Washington are trying to trap the otter. and it will likely be killed unless it is a female with pups, because it. has pounced on people, said Capt. Alan Myers of the Washington. Department of Fish and Wildlife. 'We're doing everything possible to capture than animal as soon as possible,' Myers said Friday. 'This is an extremely rare incident. Otters are not known to be aggressive toward people.' The boy's mother, Tabitha Moser, saw the four-foot otter attack her son and her mother saved him. A state worker was unable to find the otter, so expert trappers were called in from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services, Myers said. They'll try to trap it with a foot snare or tranquilize it. 'We're not sure if it's a hyper-aggressive male protecting territory or a female protecting its young,' Myers said. An eight-year-old boy and his grandmother were attacked by an otter in Washington's Pilchuck River. 'There's a lot of liability in trying to relocate an animal that's been hyper-aggressive, and it would likely be euthanized. If it's a female with pups, there's another possible outcome if we can find a good location.' But the otter would have to be killed in any case so its brain could be tested for rabies, if that's a concern for doctors treating the boy and his grandmother, he said. 'There are no known cases of otter rabies in Washington,; he said. 'That's an extremely remote possibility.' The grandmother was treated at Harborview. Medical Center in Seattle and the boy at Providence Medical Center in. Everett, the boy's mother, Tabitha Moser told KING. The attack took place in Washington's Pilchuck River - about 30 miles northeast of Seattle (pictured) 'All of a sudden I just heard him scream for his life. He was just bobbing up and down in the water and as he came up there was something all the way on top of his head,' she told KING. The otter continued to attack as they left the water. 'Even after it got into the river and out of our way it stood on its hind legs looking at us like, 'Don't do it again; don't come in here,'' she told KING. Myers said he has not heard of any other otter attacks in Washington but there have been some around the country. Lake Conner Park has been closed, and signs have been posted along the Pilchuck River warning people to beware of the otter, Myers said. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1.

While celebrating his most recent success, he is approached by his colleague Nathan 'Nate' Roenick (Guilfoyle) who warns him that large sums of money are being embezzled from the Chicago Police Department's disability fund of which Roman is on the board. Roenick has an informant with whom he was at the Police Academy and served with for a while, but refuses to name him. Later that evening, Roman is summoned via his pager for another meeting with Roenick but instead finds him dead by gunshot wounds.The case goes badly for Roman when it is assigned to Inspector Niebaum (Walsh) of the Internal Affairs Division (IAD) whom Roenick claimed was part of the embezzling. Furthermore the gun used to kill Roenick was one of three that were part of a case Roman handled in the past: two were recovered but not the third. Documents found in Roman's house indicate that the money has gone to an offshore account of which he denies any knowledge.Facing serious charges, suspended from the force and rejected by his friends, including Roenick's widow, a frustrated Roman storms into Niebaum's office and, in the chaos that follows, takes him and several others hostage, including his personal assistant Maggie (Fallon), police Commander Grant Frost (Rifkin) and two-bit con-man Rudy Timmons (Giamatti).With the building evacuated and placed under siege by police and FBI, Roman issues his conditions which include finding Roenick's informant and summoning police Lieutenant Chris Sabian (Spacey), another top negotiator.

This allows for heat to be lost through radiation. Next, sweat glands become active to produce sweat, which is released from the pores onto the skin's surface. The moisture, or sweat, then evaporates, which requires energy in the form of heat. As a result, the heat is transferred from the body to the environment, cooling the body down.

The game started out slow for both the Texans and Chiefs, but with Kansas City poised to score first, rookie placekicker Justin Medlock missed a 30-yard field goal. The Texans used their second possession to advance to the red zone, but a pass from Matt Schaub intended for Andre Johnson was intercepted by Chiefs safety Jarrad Page in the end zone. Beginning the second quarter, Chiefs center Casey Wiegmann fumbled the ball, but it was recovered by quarterback Damon Huard. After a possession by the Texans, kick returner Eddie Drummond fumbled and the ball was recovered by Houston. The Texans capitalized on the turnover and scored first through a field goal. With just over six minutes left in the half, Matt Schaub completed a 77-yard pass to Andre Johnson, and the Texans secured their lead, 10-0. Beginning the third quarter, Chiefs fullback Kris Wilson appeared to have fumbled the football, although it was disputed whether or not he had possession. The fumble was recovered by Texans defensive end Mario Williams for a touchdown. The Chiefs finally scored, through a field goal, with thirty seconds remaining in the third quarter. For the first ten minutes of play in the fourth quarter, the Texans controlled the ball and kept the Chiefs' offense off the field.

Write some highlights for the following article: A teenager has been suspended from school after teachers mistook her non-alcoholic shandy for a bottle of lager. Nikita Morrison, 13, was in a French lesson when she put the bottle of Ben Shaw’s Bitter Shandy on her desk while unpacking her school books. But teachers immediately confiscated the 500ml drink and within minutes she was sent home after being excluded for three days. Controversy: Nikita Morrison, 13, who has been suspended from Gloucester Academy for bringing in the drink. She claims staff at Gloucester Academy considered the soft drink to be alcohol - despite the product’s website stating it is suitable for children. The alcohol content of the drink is less than 0.5 per cent - not enough to legally qualify as an intoxicating liquor and it is sold in the soft drinks aisle in shops. Ms Morrison, who has never been excluded before, said: ‘I couldn’t believe it. ‘You see kids at school drinking it all the time, even the Year 7s, there is nothing wrong with it. ‘The teachers told me I wasn’t allowed to bring it into school because it is lager. I told them it was pop but they just wouldn’t listen.’ Anger: Nikita's mother, Amanda (right), has described her suspension as 'absurd' and complained that she is now behind with her lessons. Ben Shaw’s Bitter Shandy contains 12 per cent beer but is sold in the soft drink aisle in shops. No ID is needed to buy it and it is officially classed as a soft drink by the UK Food Standards Agency. Her mother Amanda, 38, said the incident on Wednesday was ‘absolutely ludicrous’. ‘It is absurd, the staff were saying it was alcohol. ‘She has missed quite a few lessons now, it is ridiculous. She is special needs so she is dropping behind even more. Safe: The shandy that Ms Morrison brought into school contains less than 0.5 per cent alcohol and is sold in the soft drinks sections of shops. ‘It find it absolutely ludicrous that she is missing out on education because of a bottle of pop. ‘Despite the fact we have explained, and proven, that it is not alcohol the school won’t listen at all.’ The stay-at-home mum-of-nine added: ‘There is nothing wrong with taking that drink into school at all. ‘I tried to explain that it was my mistake and I bought it from the supermarket but that was not good enough.’ Alan Armstrong, interim headteacher at Gloucester Academy, defended the exclusion. He said: ‘This school and all schools never exclude a student lightly or for trivial reasons. Schools have a duty of care to ensure all students are kept safe.’ A Ben Shaw’s spokesman said: ‘Shandies with less than 0.5 per cent alcohol by volume are defined as soft drinks and as such have no restriction on their sale or consumption. ‘All products we manufacture under the shandy name are less than 0.5 per cent and this is stated on labelling.’ Highlights:","output":"1. 13-year-old Nikita Morrison was suspended from Gloucester Academy after teachers mistook her non-alcoholic shandy for a bottle of lager. 2.

The Macintosh took 45 percent of operating profits in the PC industry during Q4 2012, compared to 13 percent for Dell, seven percent for Hewlett Packard, six percent for Lenovo and Asus, and one percent for Acer. While sales of the Macintosh have largely held steady, in comparison to Apple's sales of the iPhone and iPad which increased significantly during the 2010s, Macintosh computers still enjoy high margins on a per unit basis, with the majority being their MacBooks that are focused on the ultraportable niche that is the most profitable and only growing segment of PCs.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who is the sister of the spirit that the psychic bookstore clerk helps?  Elizabeth Masterson, a young emergency medicine physician whose work is her whole life, is in a serious car accident while on her way to a blind date. Three months later, David Abbott, a landscape architect recovering from the sudden death of his wife, moves into the apartment that had been Elizabeth's, after 'discovering' it in what seems to be a fateful happenstance. Elizabeth's spirit begins to appear to David in the apartment with ghostly properties and abilities that make it clear that something is not right. She can suddenly appear and disappear, walk or move through walls and objects, and once takes over his actions. When they meet, they are both surprised, as Elizabeth is still unaware of her recent history and refuses to think she is dead. David tries to have her spirit exorcised from the apartment, but to no avail. Since only David can see and hear her, others think that he is hallucinating and talking to himself. David and Elizabeth begin to bond, as much as that is possible, and he takes her out of town to a beautiful landscaped garden he designed. Elizabeth tells him she senses she has been there before, and in fact, the garden was something she was dreaming of in the opening scenes of the film, where she was awakened by a colleague from cat-napping after working a 23-hour shift in the hospital. Together, assisted by a psychic bookstore clerk, Darryl, Elizabeth and David find out who she is, what happened to her, and why they are connected. She is not dead, but in a coma, her body being kept on life support at the hospital where she used to work. When David discovers that in accordance with her living will, she will soon be allowed to die, he tries to prevent this by telling Elizabeth's sister, Abby, that he can see her and what the situation involves. One of Elizabeth's young nieces is revealed to be able to sense her presence as well. Answer:","output":"The sister of the spirit that the psychic bookstore clerk helps is Abby."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Title: A Cry in the Dark Movie plot: Seventh-day Adventist Church pastor Michael Chamberlain, his wife Lindy, their two sons, and their nine-week-old daughter Azaria are on a camping holiday in the Outback. With the baby sleeping in their tent, the family is enjoying a barbecue with their fellow campers when a cry is heard. Lindy returns to the tent to check on Azaria and is certain she sees a dingo with something in its mouth running off as she approaches. When she discovers the infant is missing, everyone joins forces to search for her, without success. It is assumed what Lindy saw was the animal carrying off the child, and a subsequent inquest rules her account of events is true.The tide of public opinion soon turns against the Chamberlains. For many, Lindy seems too stoic, too cold-hearted, and too accepting of the disaster that has befallen her. Gossip about her begins to swell and soon is accepted as statements of fact. The couple's beliefs are not widely practised in the country, and when the media reports a rumour that the name Azaria means \\"sacrifice in the wilderness\\" (when in fact it means \\"blessed of God\\"), the public is quick to believe they decapitated their baby with a pair of scissors as part of a bizarre religious rite. Law-enforcement officials find new witnesses, forensics experts, and a lot of circumstantial evidenceincluding a small wooden coffin Michael uses as a receptacle for his parishioners' packs of un-smoked cigarettesand reopen the investigation, and eventually Lindy is charged with murder. Seven months pregnant, she ignores her attorneys' advice to play on the jury's sympathy and appears emotionless on the stand, convincing onlookers she is guilty of the crime of which she is accused. As the trial progresses, Michael's faith in his religion and his belief in his wife disintegrate, and he stumbles through his testimony, suggesting he is concealing the truth. In October 1982, Lindy is found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour, while Michael is found guilty as an accessory and given an 18-month... Answer:","output":"The public opinion turns against Lindy Chamberlain and her husband Michael Chamberlain. This is mainly due to Lindy appearing too stoic and cold-hearted, as well as the couple's uncommon religious beliefs. Additionally, the media reports a rumour about the meaning of their daughter's name, Azaria, further fueling the public's belief that the couple was involved in a bizarre religious rite which led to the death of their child."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Al Larocque says he's always been truthful when crossing the border.      But if the Fruitvale, B.C., resident is asked by U.S. border agents if he's ever smoked marijuana, he knows what he's going to do.      \\"I'm going to lie,\\" he said Tuesday.      Larocque lives just north of B.C.'s border with Washington state, a boundary he crosses several times a year to reach his winter home in Arizona.​      But a report Monday — about Estevan, Sask., residents being refused entry into North Dakota after admitting to past cannabis use — has Larocque spooked about his next southbound trip next month.      \\"I don't want to lie. And I'm going to lie. And that is unfortunate. Because I am a truthful person and I think most Canadians are,\\" he said.      Larocque is worried about getting cut off from his second home.      Still, he should rethink his plan, say lawyers consulted by CBC News.      \\"Do not do that. Trust me,\\" said Henry Chang, a partner at the Toronto law firm Blaney McMurtry LLP who specializes in immigration law and practises in both Ontario and California.      The repercussions of being caught lying to a U.S. border agent outweigh the potential gain of fibbing without detection, Chang said — namely, you could be permanently banned from entering the U.S.      'People don't understand' the rules: lawyer      There are two other things that could get you banned from the U.S. in the post-Canadian legalization age, according to Chang.      The first is a prior conviction for marijuana possession.      The second is admitting to having used marijuana before its recreational use was legalized by the Canadian government on Oct. 17.      Henry Chang, an immigration lawyer based in Toronto, says people can refuse to answer the question and seek American legal advice in the meantime. (Blaney McMurtry LLP)      \\"If you say, 'Yeah, I smoked marijuana when I was 18, but it's not a problem, right?' — it is problem. You are barred for life, as if you had been convicted back then. People don't understand that,\\" said Chang.      \\"Legalization doesn't cure prior problems,\\" he added.      Medical marijuana users with a valid prescription who admit to using the drug won't be banned, Chang said, though they still can't import any marijuana into the U.S.      What about recreational users who admit to doing marijuana after it was legalized?      \\"It's not as black and white,\\" said Chang.      If it was a one-time tryout by a curious newbie involving cannabis bought from a legal Canadian seller, \\"you should be OK,\\" he said.      Medically examined for signs of addiction      But a person who admits to using cannabis repeatedly could still be barred from entering the United States, said Chang.      \\"If they conclude that you're a drug abuser [or addict], you're barred [on] that ground, separate and apart from whether it's legal or not.\\"      That conclusion can't be reached, however, until a Canadian panel physician approved by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) examines someone following a detention.      \\"You will be temporarily banned until you get the medical exam done,\\" said Chang, adding that the findings are shared directly with CBP, not with the patient.      \\"If they tell you [at your next border trip] you're not getting in, you know what the medical exam said,\\" he said.      People barred on this ground aren't necessarily banned for life, however, thanks to what Chang called a \\"remission provision.\\" The panel physician (either in Vancouver, Toronto or elsewhere) may re-examine someone and find they no longer meet the definition of addict or abuser.      \\"But it can bar someone for several years until they have proven that they no longer use drugs, including legal cannabis,\\" said Chang.      Andrew Mason, a Saskatoon defence lawyer, said people with past convictions for pot possession can obtain a waiver but it's a costly and 'cumbersome' process. (CBC)      People with a prior pot possession conviction have an option too.      They can apply to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for a waiver (form I-192) that would essentially see the U.S. government overlook a past offence.      People have to provide a criminal record check and references, pay a 1,200 Cdn fee and periodically get their waiver renewed.      \\"It's a cumbersome process,\\" said Andrew Mason, a Saskatoon-based defence lawyer.      And it's not to be confused with a pardon from the Canadian government, which may not do any good anyway, Mason added.      \\"It doesn't erase the fact that you had committed the offence in the past.\\"      Their advice? Delay      Given all these strict rules, what should marijuana users do when questioned by border agents?      \\"That's a question I get a lot,\\" said Chang. \\"It's a no-win situation for anyone who gets asked the question.      \\"If you admit to using controlled substances prior to legalization, you are barred,\\" he continued. \\"If you lie and say you've never smoked it and they find out, it's a permanent bar for material misrepresentation, which is also quite serious.\\"      Chang and Mason agree it's better to take a take a third, if imperfect, approach.      Delay.      \\"Refuse to answer the question. Say it's irrelevant. Say you don't know why this question is being asked,\\" said Chang.      It won't get people to their destinations — and they'll merely be confronted with the same question next time — but at least they can consult a lawyer, he said.      That lawyer may even be able to resolve the situation directly with CBP \\"without you having to make an actual admission,\\" said Chang.      \\"Because once you've admitted it, it's done. You're barred. Nothing anybody can do except apply for a waiver.\\"      A diplomatic solution      Mason is hopeful another solution can be worked out.      \\"I expect the governments of Canada and the U.S will get together and make it so that most people who have smoked it in the past but who are not likely to break U.S. drug laws will not be disallowed in the United States.      \\"But that's going to take a bit of negotiation and discussion.\\" ||||| The Mayor of Estevan, Sask. is concerned that people trying to cross the border are being turned away for saying they have smoked marijuana in the past.      “In a lot of cases people are being asked if they have smoked pot at the border and part of the problem is the people that have admitted to smoking and in some cases are being turned away, said Estevan Mayor Roy Ludwig.      The mayor said he knows of a few cases already where people have been turned back and refused entry to the United States.

Are they going to have to lie? I hope it doesn’t come to that,” Ludwig said.

(Some might, some won’t.)      “With the federal government bringing in the legislation to make pot legal, this is one of the side issues that will have to be looked at and hopefully dealt with at the border – how do you communicate and make things right for people that want to go down there,” Ludwig said.      “As long as they are not under the influence should they be penalized for something that is legal in their country, should they be penalized for something they did 30 years ago and maybe even haven’t smoked it since? It seems a little harsh.”      Estevan has received two marijuana shop licenses and plans on opening up two stores, but they will initially start with one store and sort through the issues first before they open up the second shop in the city. ||||| Pot Is Now Legal In Canada. But Admitting To Using It Can Get You Banned From U.S.      Enlarge this image toggle caption Brittany Greeson/The Washington Post/Getty Images Brittany Greeson/The Washington Post/Getty Images      It's now legal for adults to smoke pot in Canada. But some Canadians have found themselves barred – possibly permanently – if they admit at the U.S. border that they have used marijuana.      Estevan, Saskatchewan, is just 10 miles north of the border with North Dakota. The town's mayor, Roy Ludwig, told the CBC that residents have been turned away at the border for admitting to marijuana use.      \\"It is a fairly serious concern,\\" Ludwig said. \\"Even people that might have smoked it 20, 30 years ago, they're being asked, 'Have you ever smoked cannabis?' when they get to the U.S. border. We understand some people have said yes, that they have, and have been turned back.\\"      And the concern is not only that they won't be able to enter the U.S. once – but that they can be banned permanently.      That's what happened to Bill Powers, a 57-year-old Canadian who has a medical marijuana license, The Los Angeles Times reported. Border agents asked if Powers had ever smoked pot before getting the license. When he said he had, he was labeled \\"inadmissible\\" and barred from entering the U.S.      \\"I thought they were kidding,\\" he told the newspaper. \\"They're treating people like terrorists when all we did was admit to smoking some pot.\\"      Customs and Border Protection was decidedly not kidding.      Act 212 of the Immigration and Nationality Act lists some 60 reasons why a non-U.S. citizen can be deemed ineligible to enter the the country. Those reasons range from being a money launderer to being a Nazi.      A few of the reasons concern drugs, and can potentially apply at the border to non-U.S. citizens who admit to having used marijuana, depending on the situation. One blocks entry to noncitizens who are determined \\"to be a drug abuser or addict.\\" Another bars those who have been convicted of crimes involving controlled substances. A third bars those whom officers have reason to believe \\"is or has been an illicit trafficker in any controlled substance.\\"      CBP spokesperson Stephanie Malin tells NPR that \\"on the U.S. side, nothing has changed.\\" Despite legalization in a number of U.S. states and the District of Columbia, marijuana remains a controlled substance under federal law.      She says that every inspection is different, and not everyone will be asked about drug use. \\"However, if during the course of the inspection, there is reason for the officer to ask about it, they will. ... It comes down to the intent of the travel.\\"      In October, CBP issued a statement regarding Canadians working in that country's legal cannabis industry. Canadians working in that industry in Canada may only travel legally to the U.S. if their travel does not involve the marijuana business.      The Canadian government warns travelers that the U.S. \\"has a zero-tolerance policy and imposes severe penalties for the possession of even a small amount of an illegal drug.\\" The CBC reports that the Canadian government \\"will post signs at border crossings warning Canadians not to bring their legal marijuana into the U.S. — just as the Americans do for their citizens with signs informing them of Canada's strict firearms regime.\\"      The CBP doesn't track how many Canadian citizens have been barred from entering the U.S. for marijuana-related reasons. But Malin says that the CBP has \\"not seen a noticeable spike\\" in Canadians turned away at the border this year.      Canadians who are barred from entering for having used marijuana in the past may apply for a waiver. But they can be costly and cumbersome to attain, and must be renewed every five years.      Henry Chang, a partner at Toronto law firm Blaney McMurtry who specializes in immigration law, advises pot-smoking Canadians to neither admit to marijuana use, nor lie about it.      \\"Refuse to answer the question. Say it's irrelevant. Say you don't know why this question is being asked,\\" Chang told the CBC. They won't be able to enter the U.S. on that occasion, he says, but they will be able to go and consult with a lawyer who may be able to resolve the situation.      Asked if the CBP's stance might be too severe, Malin says that her agency is simply enforcing U.S. immigration law. And while the law could change, she says, there is no indication that the agency will change how it enforces the current law. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"A summary is a brief explanation of the main points or main ideas in a story, article, or text.

Given the question: Information:  - Herodium (Latin), Herodeion, best known in Israel as Herodion and in Arabic as Jabal al-Fureidis (lit. \\"Paradise Hill\\") is a truncated cone-shaped hill, located south of Jerusalem and southeast of Bethlehem, in the Judaean Desert, West Bank. Herod the Great built a palace fortress and a small town at Herodium, between 23 and 15 BCE, and is believed to have been buried there. Herodium is 758 meters (2,487 ft) above sea level, the highest peak in the Judaean Desert. Today, the site is managed by the Israel National Parks Authority.  - The Second Temple was an important Jewish Holy Temple (\\"Beit HaMikdash HaSheni\\") which stood on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem during the Second Temple period, between 516 BCE and 70 CE. According to Jewish (and subsequently, Christian) tradition, it replaced Solomon's Temple (the First Temple), which was destroyed by the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 586 BCE, when Jerusalem was conquered and a portion of the population of the Kingdom of Judah was taken into exile in Babylon.  - Antipater II ( Greek :  ; c. 46 -- 4 BC ) was Herod the Great 's first - born son , his only child by his first wife Doris . He was named after his paternal grandfather Antipater the Idumaean . He and his mother were exiled after Herod divorced her between 43 BC and 40 BC to marry Mariamne I. However , he was recalled following Mariamne 's fall in 29 BC and in 13 BC Herod made him his first heir in his will . He retained this position even when Alexandros and Aristobulos ( Herod 's sons by Mariamne ) rose in the royal succession in 12 BC , and even became exclusive successor to the throne after their execution in 7 BC ( with Herod Philip I in second place ) . However , in 5 BC Antipater was brought before Publius Quinctilius Varus , then Roman governor of Syria , charged with the intended murder of his father Herod . Antipater was found guilty by Varus ; however , due to Antipater 's high rank , it was necessary for Caesar Augustus to approve of the recommended sentence of death . After the guilty verdict , Antipater 's position as exclusive successor was removed and granted to Herod Antipas . Once the sentence had approval from Augustus in 4 BC , Antipater was then executed , and Archelaus ( from the marriage with Malthace ) was made heir in his father 's will as king over Herod 's entire kingdom ( with Antipas and Philip as Tetrarchs over certain territories ) . We know two of Antipater 's wives through the writings of Josephus . First was his niece Mariamne III , daughter of Aristobulus IV. The second was a high - ranking Hasmonean princess whose first name is lost to history . She was the daughter of Antigonus the Hasmonean , the last Hasmonean king who also served as high priest . This wife of Antipater was also a first cousin of Mariamne I , renowned royal wife of Herod the Great . Josephus records that she was at the palace with Doris , Antipater 's mother , in support of her husband during his trial before Varus in 5 BC.  - Aristobulus II was the Jewish High Priest and King of Judea, 66 BC to 63 BC, from the Hasmonean Dynasty.  - Antipater I the Idumaean (died 43 BC) was the founder of the Herodian Dynasty and father of Herod the Great. According to Josephus, he was the son of Antipas (I) and had formerly held that name.  - Jesus (; c. 4 BC  c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church.  - Judea or Judæa (from , \\"Yhuda\\", \\"Yhûh\\", ,  , \\"Yahudia\\") is the ancient biblical, Roman, and modern name of the mountainous southern part of Palestine. The name originates from the Hebrew, Canaanite and later neo-Babylonian and Persian name \\"Yehudah\\" or \\"Yehud\\" for the biblical Israelite tribe of Judah (Yehudah) and associated Kingdom of Judah, which the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia dates from 934 until 586 BCE. The name of the region continued to be incorporated through the Babylonian conquest, Persian, Hellenistic, and Roman periods as Yehud, Yehud Medinata, Hasmonean Judea, and consequently Herodian Judea and Roman Judea, respectively.  - Mariamne I (died 29 BCE), also called Mariamne the Hasmonean, was a Hasmonean princess and the second wife of Herod the Great. She was known for her great beauty, as was her brother Aristobulus III. Herod's fear of his rivals, the Hasmoneans, led to him executing all of the prominent members of the family, including Mariamne.  - Jerusalem , is a city located on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. One of the oldest cities in the world, Jerusalem was named as \\"\\"Urusalima\\"\\" on ancient Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets, probably meaning \\"City of Shalem\\" after a Canaanite deity, during the early Canaanite period (approximately 2400 BCE). During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE (Iron Age II), and in the 8th century the city developed into the religious and administrative center of the Kingdom of Judah. It is considered a holy city in the three major Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.  - Titus Flavius Josephus (37  100), born Joseph ben Matityahu (Hebrew:   , \\"Yosef ben Matityahu\\"; Greek:  ), was a first-century Romano-Jewish scholar, historian and hagiographer, who was born in Jerusalemthen part of Roman Judeato a father of priestly descent and a mother who claimed royal ancestry.  - The Herodian Dynasty was a Judean dynasty of Idumaean/Edomite descent. The Herodian dynasty began with Herod the Great, who assumed the throne of Judea, with Roman support, bringing down the century long Hasmonean Kingdom. His kingdom lasted until his death in 4 BCE, when it was divided between his sons as a Tetrarchy, which lasted for about 10 years. Most of those kingdoms, including Judea proper, were incorporated into Judaea Province in 6 CE, though limited Herodian kingship continued in Northern Levant until 92, when the last Herodian monarch, Agrippa II, died and Rome assumed full power over his domain.  - Herod (\\"Hordos\\", Greek: , \\"Hrds\\"; 74/73 BCE  4 BCE), also known as Herod the Great and Herod I, was a Roman client king of Judea, referred to as the Herodian kingdom. The history of his legacy has polarized opinion, as he is known for his colossal building projects throughout Judea, including his expansion of the Second Temple in Jerusalem (Herod's Temple), the construction of the port at Caesarea Maritima, the fortress at Masada and Herodium. Vital details of his life are recorded in the works of the 1st century CE RomanJewish historian Josephus. Herod also appears in the Christian Gospel of Matthew as the ruler of Judea who orders the Massacre of the Innocents at the time of the birth of Jesus. Despite his successes, including singlehandedly forging a new aristocracy from practically nothing, he still garnered criticism from various historians. His reign polarizes opinion amongst scholars and historians, some viewing his legacy as evidence of success, or a reminder of his tyrannical rule.

Movie title: Xanadu Movie plot: Sonny Malone is a talented artist who dreams of fame beyond his job, which is the non-creative task of painting larger versions of album covers for record-store window advertisements. As the film opens, Sonny is broke and on the verge of giving up his dream. Having quit his day job to try to make a living as a freelance artist, but having failed to make any money at it, Sonny returns to his old job at AirFlo Records. After some humorous run-ins with his imperious boss and nemesis, Simpson, he resumes painting record covers. At work, Sonny is told to paint an album cover for a group called The Nine Sisters. The cover features a beautiful woman in front of an art deco auditorium (the Pan-Pacific Auditorium). Earlier that day, this same woman had collided with him, kissed him, then roller-skated away. Now, Malone becomes obsessed with finding her. He finds her at the same auditorium, now abandoned. She identifies herself as Kira, but she will not tell him anything else about herself. Unbeknownst to Sonny, Kira is one of nine mysterious and beautiful women who sprang to life from a local mural in town near the beach. Walking near the beach, Sonny befriends Daniel \\"Danny\\" McGuire, a has-been big band orchestra leader turned construction mogul. Danny lost his muse in the 1940s (who is seen in a flashback scene to bear a startling resemblance to Kira), and Sonny has not yet found his muse. Kira encourages the two men to form a partnership and open a nightclub at the old auditorium from the album cover. She falls in love with Sonny, and this presents a problem because she is actually an Olympian Muse (\\"Kira's\\" real name is Terpsichore, the Muse of Dance). The other eight women from the beginning of the film are her sisters and fellow goddesses, the Muses, and the mural is actually a portal of sorts and their point of entry to Earth. The Muses visit Earth often to help inspire others to pursue their dreams and desires, but in Kira's case, she has violated the rules by which Muses are supposed to conduct themselves, as... Answer:","output":"Kira is a character in the movie Xanadu, played by Olivia Newton-John. She is one of the nine Muses from Greek mythology, specifically Terpsichore, the Muse of Dance. Throughout the film, Kira serves as a source of inspiration and plays a vital role in helping the main characters, Sonny Malone, a struggling artist, and Daniel \\"Danny\\" McGuire, a has-been big band orchestra leader, achieve their dreams. The plot of Xanadu revolves around Sonny's desire to achieve success in the creative world of art and Danny's redemption as a once-successful orchestra leader. After a series of encounters and revelations about Kira's true identity, Sonny and Danny decide to open a nightclub at an old abandoned auditorium featured on an album cover that Sonny was tasked to paint for a group called The Nine Sisters. This decision opens up a path to personal and professional growth for both characters, supported by Kira's mysterious presence and guidance. Kira's love affair with Sonny, however, goes beyond the boundaries set for Muses, as they are not supposed to engage in romantic relationships with the mortals they inspire. This adds a layer of tension and conflict to the story, as Kira must come to terms with the consequences of her actions and ultimately make decisions that could affect not just her future, but also that of the budding creative partnership between Sonny and Danny. In deciding whether to invest in the film proposal, it would be crucial to consider several factors that could affect the film's potential for success. These include but are not limited to: 1. The target audience: Is the movie intended for a specific demographic or a niche market, like fans of musicals, fantasy, or Greek mythology? Or does it aim to cater to a wider mainstream audience? 2. The cast and crew: Are the actors, directors, and producers involved in the film likely to deliver a compelling final product that captures audiences' attention and satisfies their entertainment needs? 3. The budget: Does the film proposal provide a reasonable and well-thought-out budget, in line with the production needs and potential revenues from the project? 4. The storytelling and visual elements: Does the screenplay have a strong and engaging narrative structure, with well-developed characters, dramatic tension, and emotional depth? Are the visual elements of the film, such as set design and special effects, in line with current industry standards and trends? 5. The current market: What is the demand for movies like Xanadu in today's entertainment industry? Are there similar films that have succeeded or failed in the market recently, and what could be learned from their experiences? By evaluating these factors, and any other relevant considerations, you will be better prepared to make an informed decision on whether to invest in the Xanadu film proposal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article with the title: \\"Reality bites Obama in Iraq\\"","output":"Title: Reality Bites Obama in Iraq Introduction: In a world where ambitions and principles collide, reality often serves as the great equalizer. For former US President Barack Obama, this statement rings true as his Middle East policy met unforeseen consequences in Iraq. The genuine desire for peace and stability in the region paradoxically led to chaos and disorder, further solidifying the harshness of realpolitik. This article will delve into Obama's administration's handling of Iraq, highlighting both its achievements and pitfalls. A Promising Start: When Obama ascended to the presidency in 2009, America was entangled in the Iraq War—an endeavor that had cost trillions of dollars and thousands of lives. The new president, voted into office on a platform of change, immediately sought to improve the situation. One of his first foreign policy decisions was the announcement of a timeline for troop withdrawal from Iraq, in line with his campaign promise to end the war. In 2011, when the last American combat troops left Iraq, Obama's supporters declared the mission accomplished, asserting that Iraq was on its path to democracy and peace. However, the optimism would soon turn out to be misguided. The Rise of ISIS: Swiftly following the US troop withdrawal, Iraq plunged into a chaotic state. The fragile political situation, worsened by sectarian rivalries and rampant corruption, created a power vacuum that birthed the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).  ISIS was quick to capitalize on the fractures in Iraq's social fabric. The minority Sunni community felt marginalized and oppressed under the predominantly Shiite government, quickly becoming a fertile ground for extremist ideologies. As ISIS began seizing territory, establishing its so-called caliphate, thousands of Iraqis fled their homes in fear. Slow Pace of Intervention: In 2014, ISIS shocked the world by capturing Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, and declaring the establishment of its caliphate in the territories it controlled. The sheer speed and audacity of the group's advance put immense pressure on the Obama administration to act. However, the US response was seen as slow and insufficient by many. Restricted airstrikes and limited support to Iraqi and Kurdish forces were deemed insufficient to defeat the pervasive threat posed by ISIS. Critics argued that Obama's promise to keep American troops out of Iraq had clouded his judgment, preventing the deployment of the necessary force to defeat the terror group. Lessons Learned: The eventual collapse of ISIS' territorial control came as a result of the collective efforts of coalition partners, Iraqi forces, Kurdish militias, and the unwavering determination of the people who lived under the group's tyranny. Looking back at Obama's Middle East policy, several key takeaways emerge. 1. Unintended consequences: Obama's intent to resolve the Iraq issue peacefully was laudable, but the decision to withdraw troops from an unstable state contributed to a power vacuum that ISIS was quick to fill. Policy decisions should consider both the long-term effects and unintended outcomes. 2. Local stability and regional security: In an interconnected world, local instability can have broader implications. The impact of Iraq's descent into chaos rippled through the region, leading to destabilization in neighboring countries such as Syria. 3. Importance of inclusive governance: The neglect of the concerns of Iraq's Sunni population fostered an environment conducive to extremist ideologies. A stable society requires inclusive governance that addresses the needs and aspirations of every community. Conclusion: The path to peace is rarely straightforward. As the Obama administration discovered, untangling the intricate web of policies and legacies left by the prior administration would prove to be a Herculean task. That said, though the experience was fraught with difficulties, it provides critical insights into the complexities of international relations and the importance of long-term strategic planning—a lesson that all leaders would do well to remember."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Ibn Khaldun can be regarded as the earliest scientific systematic sociologist. The modern sociology, emerged in the early 19th century as the academic response to the modernization of the world. Among many early sociologists (e.g., Émile Durkheim), the aim of sociology was in structuralism, understanding the cohesion of social groups, and developing an \\"antidote\\" to social disintegration. Max Weber was concerned with the modernization of society through the concept of rationalization, which he believed would trap individuals in an \\"iron cage\\" of rational thought. Some sociologists, including Georg Simmel and W. E. B. Du Bois, utilized more microsociological, qualitative analyses. This microlevel approach played an important role in American sociology, with the theories of George Herbert Mead and his student Herbert Blumer resulting in the creation of the symbolic interactionism approach to sociology.

Two key senators on Thursday announced that the bipartisan proposal they've crafted to fix Obamacare's cost-sharing reduction (CSR) payments has a total of 24 original co-sponsors on both sides of the aisle.      Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tennessee, the chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor & Pensions Committee, reached an agreement with his ranking member, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, and it's backed by 12 Democrats and 12 Republicans.      The short-term deal would extend CSR payments for the next two years and would eliminate the question about whether paying them is legal. The agreement would permanently amend Obamacare to give new flexibility for states to create insurance policies that have a larger variety and lower costs and it also would continue CSRs during 2018 and 2019.      \\"This is a first step,\\" Alexander said on the Senate floor. \\"Improve it, and pass it sooner rather than later.\\"      Here are the co-sponsors:      Sen.

Maggie Hassan, D-New Hampshire            Alexander noted that the subsidies pay for co-pays and deductibles for low-income Americans and he noted that every Republican in the House who voted to repeal and replace Obamacare earlier this year voted for a provision in their measure that would continue CSR payments for the next two years.      The GOP senator said that he and Murray are open to improving the language of their agreement and they both emphasized that they wrote it so that it requires states to make sure that the benefits of the payments go to the consumer and not insurance companies.      Alexander said that the short-term deal resulted from negotiations with Murray, with whom he had already been working, when President Trump called him on Columbus Day weekend to inform him that he would cut off the CSR payments and to request that Congress put together a short-term deal to continue them. Publicly, Mr. Trump has repeatedly slammed the subsidies, claiming they enrich insurers. He complained earlier this week that the nation's biggest insurers \\"have absolutely taken advantage of this country and our people. And I stopped it by stopping the CSRs.\\" Last week he declared, \\"I don't want to make the insurance companies rich. If you look at their stock price over the last number of years — take a look at what's happened with those insurance companies — they're making a fortune by getting that kind of money.\\"      Murray said that CSR payments have \\"nothing to do with politics\\" and have everything to do with whether families can \\"make ends meet.\\"      After President Trump announced last week that he would end cost-sharing subsidies paid to insurers under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Republican and Democratic senators announced they had reached a deal to continue the payments for two years and allow states greater flexibility under President Obama's signature legislation.      Initially, the president embraced the bill, saying at Rose Garden press conference, \\"For a period of one year, two years, we will have a very good solution.\\" He called it a \\"short-term solution, so that we don't have this very dangerous little period, including a dangerous period for insurance companies, by the way.\\"      But later that day, in a speech at a conservative think tank, he qualified his earlier comments. \\"While I commend the bipartisan work done by Senators Alexander and Murray - and I do commend it - I continue to believe Congress must find a solution to the Obamacare mess instead of providing bailouts to insurance companies.\\" The White House later pointed to this remark to illustrate that Mr. Trump, in fact, opposes the Alexander-Murray plan.      Many conservatives have denounced the deal, though, because it does not repeal and replace the ACA. ||||| Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) called on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellThe Hill's Morning Report — Sponsored by Better Medicare Alliance — Anticipation builds for Trump’s SCOTUS pick Election Countdown: Calls to abolish ICE test Dem candidates | First round of House GOP 'Young Guns' | How Tester is handling Trump's Montana visit | Dem candidate won't back Schumer as leader | Super PACs ramp up Missouri ad buys McConnell uses Michael Jordan GIF to mock report that Schumer asked Trump to nominate Merrick Garland MORE (R-Ky.)

On the other hand, the second sentence \\"Itami-go was a part of the castle of Arioka, which ruled Oda Nobunaga under Araki Murashige.\\" suggests that the castle of Arioka (and therefore, Itami-go) had authority or rule over Oda Nobunaga, under the direction or power of Araki Murashige. Given these described situations are different, these sentences cannot be considered as paraphrases. The change of positions between Araki Murashige and Oda Nobunaga in the structures of these two sentences drastically alters the suggested power dynamics and relationships between the characters and places discussed. This clear variation in meaning prevents the sentences from being classified as paraphrases, because they convey different storylines and information in a historical and factual context."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Solve this instance: By Vincent DowdArts correspondent, BBC News He was a hugely celebrated painter but before they met in 1935 she was already known in France for her photographic work. The Tate Modern exhibition sheds light on Maar's life and on her sometimes neglected work. In 1935 Maar (born Henriette Théodora Markovitch) was unit stills photographer on a film being shot at the Billancourt Studios on the outskirts of Paris. She was introduced to Picasso, 26 years her senior and already a world-famous artist. Maar became his lover and - some have thought - the most influential of his muses. For the next eight years they were part of one another's lives - although Picasso continued his existing relationship with Marie-Thérèse Walter. Those few basic facts are often all that even art-lovers know about Maar, who died in 1997. Over the years there were many women in Picasso's life and she was undoubtedly one of those who mattered most to him. But Maar's reputation has been growing. A version of the Tate Modern show has already been seen at the Pompidou Centre in Paris and next year the exhibition will travel to Los Angeles. As a photographer and a painter in her own right does she deserve now to step out of his shadow? Or could what she achieved now be overstated, to compensate for decades of neglect? Professor Mary Ann Caws wrote a book about Maar 20 years ago, before her reputation had revived, and considers Maar to have been a \\"remarkable talent\\". \\"Much of her early work in France was fashion photography but it's unlike anyone else's fashion photography.... the best of her pictures are very dramatic. \\"The juxtapositions are often peculiar and so is the way she used light and dark. As soon as you know even a sample of what Dora Maar did you will always recognise her work - the pictures will speak to you. The proportions of her photographs can be peculiar but the work's always telling and has an impact. \\"Some of her photos can be shadowy and have a feeling of doom yet others can be remarkably funny. But the fashion images were only one part of Dora Maar. She went to Barcelona and took pictures of starving people in desperate circumstances. A lot of that work has been ignored because people see her in the context of knowing Picasso later.\\" Emma Lewis is co-curator of the Tate Modern show, which contains more than 250 photographic images. She says she's come to admire the \\"dark glamour\\" of Maar's work but adds \\"there's a playful element too - real subversive wit\\". Maar also photographed some of the 30,000 inhabitants of \\"la zone\\" - the circular strip of undeveloped land which became a wretched linear shantytown around Paris. The Tate Modern exhibition has striking examples of all these elements of her early career. Lewis says the 1930s were the heyday of illustrated weekly and monthly magazines. \\"It provided Dora with a means of making a living and we show how talented she was in what she did. \\"It allowed her to play with avant garde and experimental imagery. She was involved with Surrealism - but I think it was very hard for a woman to be part of that group of artists. \\"Dora Maar's commercial work appeared in big French magazines of the day such as Rester Jeune. It also circulated in various arts journals and erotic reviews. \\"By and large the documentary photography was seen in exhibitions and not in print. But her politics were left-wing and in the Depression her documentary work on the plight of the poor was important to her - she had links to the radical Association of Revolutionary Writers and Artists.\\" The exhibition could hardly ignore the Picasso connection. But it puts that part of Maar's life in context. As a photographer she recorded him working on probably his best known painting - Guernica (1937). Visitors to the Tate can see some of the Picasso works influenced by Maar in their years together, including the well-known Weeping Woman (also of 1937) which the Tate already owns. Some describe this as a portrait of Maar but she always insisted she had never modelled for Picasso for any picture. But she acknowledged he used elements of her appearance. Professor Caws says Maar was the most intellectual of Picasso muses. \\"She spoke Spanish which meant they could have real conversations about the convulsive events of the 1930s. She was beautiful but I think Picasso was attracted by the dramatic spark she had.\\" The passionate relationship faded from around 1942 and Maar headed south to live in Menérbes in Provence. So had Maar accepted that no woman would ever possess Picasso? \\"I don't think she was a woman meekly to accept anything,\\" says Professor Caws. \\"When it all ended she was screaming and passionate and furious. But when she settled in the south she developed her own skills as a painter, something which used to be ignored when people wrote about her. Those paintings can be pretty remarkable but the best of the photography is incredible. \\"So we don't need to try to cut Pablo Picasso out of her life. She still has things to say to us with him or without him.\\" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Treatments, such as benzimidazolethiol, prevent surface oxidation of bare copper. The places to which components will be mounted are typically plated, because untreated bare copper oxidizes quickly, and therefore is not readily solderable. Traditionally, any exposed copper was coated with solder by hot air solder levelling (HASL). The HASL finish prevents oxidation from the underlying copper, thereby guaranteeing a solderable surface. This solder was a tin-lead alloy, however new solder compounds are now used to achieve compliance with the RoHS directive in the EU and US, which restricts the use of lead.

During this time, Japan started its modernization and rose to world power status. This era name means \\"Enlightened Rule\\". In Japan, the Meiji Restoration started in the 1860s, marking the rapid modernization by the Japanese themselves along European lines. Much research has focused on the issues of discontinuity versus continuity with the previous Tokugawa Period. In the 1960s younger Japanese scholars led by Irokawa Daikichi, reacted against the bureaucratic superstate, and began searching for the historic role of the common people . They avoided the elite, and focused not on political events but on social forces and attitudes. They rejected both Marxism and modernization theory as alien and confining. They stressed the importance of popular energies in the development of modern Japan. They enlarged history by using the methods of social history. It was not until the beginning of the Meiji Era that the Japanese government began taking modernization seriously. Japan expanded its military production base by opening arsenals in various locations. The hyobusho (war office) was replaced with a War Department and a Naval Department.

It is very easy to chip a nail without necessarily breaking a finger. The  Choices:  A). Finger is very strong.  B). Nail is very strong.","output":"It is very easy to chip a nail without necessarily breaking a finger. The reason for this can be attributed to two main factors: A). The finger is very strong. 1. Bone structure: The phalanges, or finger bones, are specially designed to withstand a lot of pressure and force due to their structure. The bones are interconnected by joints that provide support and stability, making it harder for fingers to break under normal circumstances. 2. Muscles and tendons: The fingers are also equipped with muscles and tendons that surround the bones, providing additional strength and support. These work together to enable our fingers to carry out a wide range of motions and tasks, while also aiding in the absorption of impact, lessening the likelihood of a break. However, in contrast to the strength of the finger, a nail is much more susceptible to damage. B). The nail is less strong. 1. Nail structure: Nails are made up of a protein called keratin, which is also found in hair and skin. This protein makes the nail more prone to chipping and breaking, as it is more malleable and less dense when compared to bone. 2. Exposure: Nails are exposed to external elements far more than the finger bones, increasing their vulnerability to damage. Activities like typing, scratching, or accidentally knocking the nail against a hard surface may cause it to chip or crack, even if the finger remains unharmed. In conclusion, it is important to note that while fingers are quite strong and resistant to damage due to their complex bone structure, muscles, and tendons, nails are less strong and more prone to chipping as they are made of a less dense protein and are constantly in contact with external forces. So, it is common to chip a nail without breaking a finger. To maintain nail health, it is advisable to take care of your nails through regular trimming, filing, and moisturizing, as well as avoiding harsh chemicals and activities that may weaken them."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
