Answer: A:","output":"Yes, the review is positive B: No, the review is neutral C: No, the review is negative D: We can't determine the sentiment based on the information provided Answer: B: No, the review is neutral This product review is not explicitly positive as it does not express any particular praise or appreciation for the American Horror Story show itself. It is merely describing the customer's viewing routine and the issue faced with the unavailability of the finale episode on Amazon.  The overall sentiment of this review can be considered neutral because it does not reveal any particular feelings or emotions about the show's quality, content, or satisfaction. Instead, it raises a question about when the finale will be available. The customer has not stated any negative or positive feelings about the show or their viewing experience on Amazon. They are simply stating a fact about their inability to find it at the time of writing and seeking information on when it will become available. It is essential to note that understanding the difference between positive, negative, and neutral reviews helps improve decision-making while analyzing customer feedback. In this case, the review does not provide any insights into how to improve the product or service from a customer satisfaction standpoint, but it may help the content provider understand the urgency and anticipation surrounding the series finale availability. Conclusively, it is essential to acknowledge the neutral tone of the review, as it does not provide any insight into the viewer's satisfaction or dissatisfaction with either the American Horror Story show or Amazon streaming services.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. You are given a new situation: two countries of similar natural resources had different populations. Italy had a small population, while Spain had a very large population.  and a hint : In nature, when the population size is small, there is usually plenty of food and other resources for each individual. When there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can easily reproduce, so the birth rate is high. As the population increases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease. When necessary resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will die. Overall, the population cannot reproduce at the same rate, so the birth rates drop. This will cause the population growth rate to decrease.  Please answer this question : Which country had an increased food supply?","output":"Based on the given situation and hint, it can be inferred that Italy, with its smaller population, likely experienced an increased food supply. This conclusion can be reached by examining the relationship between population size, resource availability, and birth rates in the context of the two countries. In Italy, the smaller population size would mean that there would be more food and resources available per individual. When organisms have plentiful access to necessary resources such as food, they can reproduce more easily, leading to a high birth rate. This, in turn, suggests that the population growth rate would also be high in the early stages due to the abundance of resources. On the other hand, Spain's larger population would mean that the available resources, including food, would have to be divided amongst a greater number of individuals. This increased demand for resources might make it difficult for individuals to reproduce at a high rate, leading to lower birth rates and a consequently slower population growth rate. Moreover, the decrease in available resources could lead to more competition and potential struggles for survival. Given that the availability of resources such as food would be greater per individual in Italy compared to Spain, it is likely that Italy experienced an increased food supply, due to its smaller population size. It's important to note, however, that this is a general analysis based on the provided information, and various factors such as political decisions, economic policies, and geographic conditions could also significantly impact the food supply and resource availability in each country."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible answers: Pull away, Build up courage, Grab it Answer:","output":"Based on the given context, it seems that Taylor is interested in Alex and attempts to initiate a connection by reaching for Alex's hand at the high school dance. Considering the situation, the most probable thing Taylor would want to do next is to build up courage. When Taylor reaches for Alex's hand, it implies that there is an underlying interest to not only connect during the dance but to also establish a stronger bond with Alex. This could be due to an existing friendship, a hidden crush, or simply mutual attraction during the dance. Once Taylor has established their intention by reaching for Alex's hand, they are likely to feel nervous and excited about how Alex might respond. In such a scenario, Taylor's immediate priority would be to build up courage. Building courage in this situation can manifest in several different ways. For instance, Taylor could: 1. Mentally prepare themselves for both positive and negative outcomes, knowing that expressing interest in someone requires vulnerability and that rejection is a natural part of engaging in interpersonal relationships. 2. Visualize a positive outcome with Alex, such as dancing together closely or holding hands, to boost their confidence and create a sense of excitement and motivation. 3. Reassure themselves that they are worthy of Alex's attention and that they have a lot to offer in a potential romantic or friendly relationship. As Taylor builds up the courage, they might also engage in subtle actions to convey their intention, such as maintaining eye contact, smiling at Alex, or finding ways to create a more intimate atmosphere on the dance floor. These actions will allow Taylor to gauge Alex's reactions and, hopefully, encourage a positive response from Alex. If Alex reciprocates the interest and agrees to Taylor's gesture to hold hands or dance together, Taylor's next step would likely be to focus on enjoying the moment and fostering a deeper bond with Alex through conversation, body language, and shared experiences. On the other hand, if Alex does not respond positively to Taylor's advances, Taylor may feel hurt or discouraged but will ultimately need to gather their courage and move forward, appreciating the experience as a learning opportunity and embracing their emotional vulnerability. In conclusion, given the context that Taylor reaches for Alex's hand at the high school dance, Taylor's next step is to build up courage and prepare themselves for the potential outcomes of their action, whether that is forging a stronger connection with Alex or facing the possibility of unrequited interest."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: What had a return to prominence in the Anglo-Saxon period?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The boar was an important symbol in prehistoric Europe, where, according to the archaeologist Jennifer Foster, it was \\"venerated, eulogised, hunted and eaten ... for millennia, until its virtual extinction in recent historical time.\\" Anglo-Saxon boar symbols follow a thousand years of similar iconography, coming after La Tène examples in the fourth century BC, Gaulish specimens three centuries later, and Roman boars in the fourth century AD. They likely represent a fused tradition of European and Mediterranean cultures. The boar is said to have been sacred to a mother goddess figure among linguistically Celtic communities in Iron Age Europe, while the Roman historian Tacitus, writing around the first century AD, suggested that the Baltic Aesti wore boar symbols in battle to invoke her protection. Boar-crested helmets are depicted on the turn-of-the-millennium Gundestrup cauldron, discovered in Denmark, and on a Torslunda plate from Sweden, made some five hundred years later. Though the Romans also included the boar in their stable of symbols—four legions, including the twentieth, adopted it as their emblem—it was only one among many. The boar nonetheless persisted in continental Germanic tradition during the nearly 400 years of Roman rule in Britain, such as in association with the Scandinavian gods Freyja and Freyr. Its return to prominence in the Anglo-Saxon period, as represented by the boars from Benty Grange, Wollaston, Guilden Morden, and Horncastle, may therefore suggest the post-Roman reintroduction of a Germanic tradition from Europe, rather than the continuation of a tradition in Britain through 400 years of Roman rule. Whatever its precise symbolism, the Anglo-Saxon boar appears to have been associated with protection; the Beowulf poet makes this clear, writing that boar symbols on helmets kept watch over the warriors wearing them. Answer:","output":"The return to prominence in the Anglo-Saxon period was the boar symbol. Boar symbols from Benty Grange, Wollaston, Guilden Morden, and Horncastle represent the revival of this iconography, likely suggesting the post-Roman reintroduction of a Germanic tradition from Europe rather than the continuation of a tradition in Britain through 400 years of Roman rule.

(EW) -- In \\"Elysium,\\" Neill Blomkamp's shrewdly revved-up and exciting dystopian thriller, Matt Damon's character, Max, spends most of the movie with a spidery black-metal exoskeleton implanted in his skull and spine. The surgically attached machinery serves several functions at once. It's there to make Max strong — a boost he critically needs, since he's been exposed to a dose of radiation that will leave him dead in just five days. It also allows him to download the contents of someone else's brain. But the most important purpose served by that added hardware may be visual and symbolic: It transforms Max into a hulkingly damaged yet superheroic man-machine — a variation on the title character of \\"RoboCop.\\" And it has the unmistakable look of a cross that he's been nailed to.","output":"As the story of \\"Elysium\\" unfolds, we follow Max, a former car thief and convict, as he navigates a divided and dystopian world. Earth is devastated, overpopulated, and polluted, while the privileged live on the luxurious space habitat Elysium, where they have access to advanced technology like medical pods capable of curing any disease. Max's unique exoskeleton enables him to fight for the downtrodden people of Earth and attempt to bridge the gap between the two worlds. Max becomes the reluctant hero, teaming up with a group of rebels led by the passionate and determined Spider. Together, they devise a plan to steal valuable information from the mind of John Carlyle, a wealthy and influential Elysium citizen who possesses the codes to reset Elysium's system. If successful, they can distribute the advanced healing technology to Earth and create a more just distribution of resources. As Max embarks on this dangerous mission, he must contend with Secretary Delacourt, who will stop at nothing to protect her privileged lifestyle in Elysium. She enlists a cold-blooded mercenary named Kruger to hunt down Max and his allies. A deadly game of cat and mouse ensues as Max fights his way through obstacles, both physical and emotional, to secure the information necessary to save Earth's suffering inhabitants. The climax of the story comes when Max, Spider, and their team infiltrate Elysium. In a thrilling series of battles, Max manages to defeat Kruger and confront Delacourt, who is killed in the ensuing chaos. Mortally wounded, Max sacrifices himself to initiate the system reboot and fulfill the mission. His action leads to widespread changes on Elysium, and the advanced medical pods are finally made available to the people of Earth, saving countless lives and bridging the wealth gap between the two worlds, at least to some extent. With the conclusion of the story, the fallen hero Max is immortalized by the people he saved, his sacrifice symbolizing the power of the individual to spark meaningful change. As the restored Elysium and Earth begin to rebuild, Max's legacy will forever be remembered as a symbol of hope and the belief that a better future is possible.

Four years later, during the 1952 Winter Olympic Games in Oslo, Norway, Dick Button defended his title as Men's singles figure skating champion. He showcased an even more impressive performance than before, as he landed the first-ever triple jump (a triple loop) in competition history. This groundbreaking achievement not only earned him his second consecutive Olympic gold medal but also solidified his status as an unparalleled figure skater in his time. Dick Button's remarkable career goes far beyond his Olympic victories. He is a five-time World Champion (1948-1952), a seven-time United States National Champion (1946-1952), and the 1949 North American Champion. Additionally, he has made lasting contributions to the sport through his innovation and creativity. He is credited with inventing the flying camel spin, a move widely used by skaters today.

Pauline was a highly intelligent and religious woman, who was well read and wrote a number of texts in her lifetime. Her shyness was well known; she was widely considered strikingly beautiful and charming, but those around her would often avoid eye contact so as not to embarrass her. Albert was devoted to his wife, and commissioned the painting after being impressed by Ingres' 1845 portrait of his sister, the Comtesse d'Haussonville. Albert approached Ingres around 1850 to undertake the portrait. Ingres dined with the de Broglie family in January 1850, and according to one eye witness, \\"seemed to be very happy with his model.\\"Although Ingres' main source of income came from portraiture, it distracted from his main interest in history painting, which early in his career, was far less lucrative. He found acclaim in the 1840s, when he became successful enough to no longer depend on commissions. This painting was Ingres' second-last female portrait, and final society portrait.Influenced by the working methods of Jacques-Louis David, Ingres began with a number of nude preparatory sketches, for which he employed professional models. He built up a picture of the sitter's underlying anatomical structure, as seen in the Musée Bonnat study, before deciding on how to build the lavish costume and accessories. Although there is no surviving record of the commissions, and the exact sequence of events is uncertain, the sketches can be dated from 1850, the year the style of her evening dress came into fashion. Ingres signed and dated the final picture at the left center \\"J. INGRES. pit 1853\\".Pauline died in 1860 aged 35 from tuberculosis. After her death, Albert published three volumes of her essays on religious history. Albert (who in 1873 became the 28th...

Article: Beijing's broadened ban on smoking in public places took effect Thursday, adding force to the effort to hold a smoke-free Olympics. The new rules extend existing anti-smoking regulations to more places, including fitness centers, cultural relic sites, offices, meeting rooms, dining halls, toilets and lifts. Restaurants, Internet cafes, parks, and waiting halls at airports, railway stations and coach stations are required to set up smoking areas. Hotels will have to offer smoke-free rooms or floors, but the regulations do not specify a proportion. However, some restaurant owners have complained that it would be difficult to have a separate smoking room as required by the new regulations. \\"We plan to issue specific rules to solve this problem as soon as possible,\\" Rao Yingsheng, vice-director of the Beijing Committee for Patriotic Public Health Campaign, was quoted by the Beijing News as saying Thursday. He said small restaurants without a separate room should set aside at least 70 percent of their area for non-smokers. He also said customers and restaurant owners would be asked for their thoughts on the new rule. Local authorities dispatched about 100,000 inspectors to make sure the ban was being enforced Thursday. Everyone has the right to dissuade people from smoking in public places, Liu Zejun, who works for the Beijing committee, said. \\"Citizens are encouraged to expose those who refuse to obey the rule by calling the free telephone line 12320,\\" Liu said. People caught smoking in forbidden areas will be fined 10 yuan (1.40), while enterprises and institutions that violate  the ban will face fines of between 1,000 yuan and 5,000 yuan. Smoking was forbidden in hospitals, kindergartens, schools, museums, sports venues and other places before the new regulations took effect. From Oct 1 last year, the city also banned smoking in its 66,000 cabs, and imposed fines of 100 yuan to 200 yuan on drivers caught smoking in taxis. China has pledged a cigarette-free, green Olympics. This year's event will be the first... Question: The passage mainly tells us   _  . - There will be more places where smoking is forbidden. - More people should give up smoking. - Broadened ban on smoking in public places took effect in order to set up a non-smoking Olympic Games. - Those who smoke at public places will be fined.

You may think people in such an attractive and exciting, fun-filled place are happier than others. If so, you have some mistaken ideas about the nature of happiness. Many intelligent people still consider happiness equal to fun. The truth is that fun and happiness have little or nothing in common. Fun is what we experience during an act. Happiness is what we experience after an act. It is a deeper, more lasting emotion. Going to an amusement park or ball game, watching a movie or television, are fun activities that help us relax, temporarily forget our problems and maybe even laugh. But they do not bring happiness, because their positive effects end when the fun ends. I have often thought that if Hollywood stars have a role to play, it is to teach us that happiness has nothing to do with fun. These rich, beautiful people have constant access to glamorous parties, fancy cars, expensive homes, everything that brings \\"happiness\\". But in memoir after memoir, famous people expose the unhappiness hidden beneath all their fun -- depression, alcoholism, drug addiction, broken marriages, troubled children and extreme loneliness. Ask an unmarried man why he refuses to get married even though he finds dating to be less and less satisfying. If he's honest, he will tell you that he is afraid of making a commitment. For commitment is in fact quite painful. The single life is filled with fun, adventure and excitement. Marriage has such moments, but they are not its most distinguishing features. Similarly, couples that choose not to have children are deciding in favor of painless fun over painful happiness. They can dine out whenever they want and sleep as late as they want. Couples with babies are lucky to get a whole night's sleep or a three-day vacation. I don't know any parent who would choose the word fun to describe raising children. The way people stick to the belief that a fun-filled, pain-free life equals happiness actually reduces their chances of ever achieving real...

Article: Andy Steele lives just a few blocks from the campus of Black Hills State University in Spearfish, S.D., so commuting  to class isn't the problem. But he doesn't like lectures much, isn't a morning person, and wants time during the day to restore motorcycles. So Steele, a full-time senior business major, has been taking as many classes as he can from the South Dakota State system's online offerings. He gets better grades and learns more, he says, and insists he isn't missing out on the college experience. \\"I still know a lot of people from my first two years living on campus, and I still meet a lot of people,\\" he says. But now, he sets his own schedule. At least 2.3 million people took some kind of online courses, according to a recent survey by The Sloan Consortium, an online education group, and two-thirds of colleges offering \\"face-to-face\\" courses also offer online ones. But what were once two different types of classes are looking more and more alike and often falling into the same pool of students. At some schools, online courses originally intended for non-traditional students living far from campus have proved surprisingly popular with on-campus students. A recent study found 42 percent of the students enrolled  in its distance education courses were located on campus at the university that was hosting the online courses. Numbers vary depending on the policies of particular colleges, but other schools also have students mixing and matching online and \\"face-to-face\\" credits. Motives range from lifestyle to adapting a job schedule to getting into high--demand courses. Washington State had about 325 on-campus undergraduates taking one or more distance courses last year.

Now, twitter, e-mail, blogs and QQ chat offer approaches to communication-- but none can replace the role of a great speech. The spoken word can handle various important functions: persuading or inspiring, informing, paying tribute  , entertaining, or simply introducing someone. Persuading is used in dealing with or _ different points of view. When the leaders met in Copenhagen in December, 2009, persuasive words from activities encouraged them to take former action. Inspirational speeches deal with emotions. They focus on topics and matters that are close to people' s hearts. Last year, during the fighting in Iraq, generals used inspiring speeches to prepare the troops for battle. Some speeches spread knowledge and deepen understanding. When the H1N1 flu was announced, the disease scared many people. Informtive speechs from World Health Organization (WTO) officials helped people to keep their panic under control so they could take necessary preventive measures. Sad events are never easy to deal with but a speech that pays tribute to the loss of a loved one and gives praise for their contribution can be comforting. Madonna's speech about Michael Jackson after his death showed the fact that he will continue to live on through his music. It's not only in world forums where public speaking plays an important role. It can also be helpful in the course of our own life. You may be asked to do a presentation at college or work to inform others about an area of great importance. On a more personal level, a friend may be upset and need comforting. Or you might be asked to introduce a speaker at a family gathering or to speak at a wedding, where your language will be needed to move people or make them laugh.

Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Available choices: (a). no. (b). yes.","output":"(a). No. These two questions are not paraphrases of each other, as they address different topics and specific scenarios. The first question pertains to a startup corporation's decision to issue all authorized but undistributed shares as \\"treasury stock.\\" Treasury stock represents the portion of shares that a company keeps in its treasury. These shares have been issued but are not outstanding, meaning they are not currently held by shareholders. Treasury stock typically occurs when a company buys back its shares from the open market or has not yet issued all authorized shares to the public. The question seeks to understand the potential drawbacks of issuing all authorized but undistributed shares as treasury stock in the context of a startup corporation. There are several reasons not to issue all authorized but undistributed shares as treasury stock: 1. Dilution: Issuing all authorized shares can lead to dilution of existing shareholders' ownership, as the total number of shares increases. This scenario might not be ideal for the startup's founders and initial investors who want to maintain a controlling stake in the company. 2. Market perception: Issuing all authorized shares as treasury stock may negatively impact the company's image in the market. Investors may view the startup as lacking in confidence about its future prospects or ability to attract more investors. 3. Retaining flexibility: Keeping a portion of authorized shares undistributed allows a startup to have flexibility in raising additional capital or issuing shares as part of employee compensation packages. If all authorized shares are issued as treasury stock, the company may need to go through the process of amending its articles of incorporation to authorize additional shares, which can be time-consuming and costly. 4. Legal and financial complexities: Managing treasury stock involves legal and financial complexities. The company has to comply with regulations and maintain extensive records related to treasury stock transactions. For startups with limited resources, focusing on growth and product development might be a higher priority. The second question discusses a unique scenario involving the Bose Corporation and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Amar Bose, the founder of the Bose Corporation, famously donated most of the company's non-voting shares to MIT. This donation did not grant MIT any decision-making power in the company but allowed the institute to enjoy the financial benefits associated with the company's success. The question seeks to understand why Amar Bose chose to give the majority of his company's stock to MIT. The main reason behind Amar Bose's decision to donate the majority of Bose Corporation's stock to MIT was his strong connection with the institute. Amar Bose was an alumnus and a former faculty member at MIT, and he credited much of his success and the development of his innovative ideas to the education and mentorship he received at MIT. By donating Bose Corporation stock to MIT, Amar Bose aimed to ensure that the institute would continue to thrive, support groundbreaking research, and foster an innovative learning environment for future generations. The two questions are thematically distinct, with the first addressing a general scenario for a startup corporation's stock management and the second exploring a specific decision made by Amar Bose that benefited MIT."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I can use this background: So much rain falling so fast causes some of the damage from a hurricane. But a lot of the damage is caused by storm surge. Storm surge is very high water located in the low pressure eye of the hurricane. The very low pressure of the eye allows the water level to rise above normal sea level. Storm surge can cause flooding when it reaches land ( Figure below ). High winds do a great deal of damage in hurricanes. High winds can also create very big waves. If the large waves are atop a storm surge, the high water can flood the shore. If the storm happens to occur at high tide, the water will rise even higher.  Now, I have a new situation: Two coastal cities, Dune and Shore, got a Hurricane warning. The hurricane hit Dune city, but missed Shore city by 50 miles. The damage was horrendous.  Answer this question please: Which city experienced a higher atmospheric pressure? A:","output":"Shore city experienced a higher atmospheric pressure. Step 1: Understand the background information - The low pressure eye of the hurricane causes storm surge. - High winds are associated with hurricanes and create damage. - Storm surge can cause flooding at the shore. Step 2: Analyze the given situation - Dune city was hit by the hurricane. - Shore city was missed by the hurricane by 50 miles. Step 3: Determine atmospheric pressure for each city - Dune city experienced the low pressure eye of the hurricane, which led to storm surge and damage. - Shore city, being 50 miles away from the hurricane's path, was not directly affected by the hurricane's eye, and therefore it was not under the influence of the low pressure eye of the hurricane. Step 4: Conclude which city experienced higher atmospheric pressure - Since Dune city experienced the low pressure eye of the hurricane and Shore city did not, it can be concluded that Shore city experienced a higher atmospheric pressure compared to Dune city."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The three fatty acids in the triacylglycerol may be similar or dissimilar. Fats are also called triacylglycerols or triglycerides because of their chemical structure. Some fatty acids have common names that specify their origin. For example, palmitic acid, a saturated fatty acid, is derived from the palm tree. Arachidic acid is derived from Arachis hypogea, the scientific name for groundnuts or peanuts. Fatty acids may be saturated or unsaturated. In a fatty acid chain, if there are only single bonds between neighboring carbons in the hydrocarbon chain, the fatty acid is said to be saturated. Saturated fatty acids are saturated with hydrogen; in other words, the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon skeleton is maximized.

Answer the following question: Process:  - Animals and plants die in soft soil or mud - Sediment builds up over the remains - The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts - The remaining parts over the years are replaced with mineral - A fossil is formed -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose animals die in soft soil less often happens, how will it affect LESS fossils forming.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The process of fossil formation consists of several stages, namely: the death of animals and plants in soft soil or mud, sedimentation and accumulation of materials over the remains, decomposition of organic matter, replacement of the remaining parts with minerals, and finally, the formation of a fossil. The perturbation hypothesis suggests that in a situation where animals and plants die in soft soil less often, there will be a consequential effect on the formation of fossils. This hypothesis has both direct and indirect effects on the fossil formation process. Direct effects of the perturbation hypothesis: The most significant direct effect of the perturbation hypothesis on the fossil formation process is the reduction in the number of potential fossils. When animals and plants die in soft soil less often, there are simply fewer remains available to become fossils. As a result, the overall probability of fossil formation decreases because the first and fundamental step in the process is diminished.  Since sedimentation and accumulation of materials over the remains are directly associated with the initial deposition of the remains, a decrease in the number of organisms dying in soft soil will lead to less sediment covering their remains. This can result in a lowered chance of preservation and eventual fossilization. In turn, fewer fossils will be found compared to a scenario where more animals and plants die within soft sediments. Indirect effects of the perturbation hypothesis: The perturbation hypothesis can also lead to indirect effects on the fossil formation process. For instance, a reduced rate of animals and plants dying in soft soil may influence the ecological balance and competition between organisms. Over time, this can lead to shifts in species populations and characteristics, which might consequently be reflected in the available fossil record. Additionally, a reduction in the number of organisms dying in soft sediment may indirectly affect the rate of sedimentation and accumulation of materials. In some cases, this can impede the natural burial and preservation processes necessary for fossil formation. As an alternative, remains might become exposed to predators, scavengers, or physical and chemical erosion, which could further impact the existing fossil record. Furthermore, the perturbation hypothesis could have knock-on effects on the overall process of decomposition and replacement of the remaining parts with minerals. This could be primarily due to the changes in sedimentation rates or the availability of minerals required for the replacement process. Consequently, these alterations can have a substantial bearing on the quality and completeness of the fossils that are ultimately formed. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis that supposes animals and plants die in soft soil less often has both direct and indirect impacts on the fossil formation process. Directly, it decreases the number of potential fossils, while indirectly, it can lead to a range of consequences, such as shifts in species populations, habitat characteristics, and the overall fossilization process. Therefore, a reduction in the number of organisms dying in soft soil can indeed lead to fewer fossils being formed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Recently the news broke that Microsoft are acquiring GitHub. Effusive opinions flowed from all directions: some saw the acquisition as a sensible fit for Microsoft to better support developers, and some saw it as a tyrant getting their grubby fingers on open source’s ecosystem. I am thrilled for Microsoft and GitHub for many reasons, and there will be a bright future ahead because of it, but I have been thinking more about the reaction some of the critics have had to this, and why. I find it fascinating that there still seems to be a deep-seated discomfort in some about Microsoft and their involvement in open source. I understand that this is for historical reasons, and many moons ago Microsoft were definitely on the offensive against open source. I too was critical of Microsoft and their approach back in those days. I may have even said ‘M’ instead of ‘MS’ (ugh.) Things have changed though. Satya Nadella, their CEO, has had a profound impact on the company: they are a significant investor and participant in open source across a multitude of open source projects, they hire many open source developers, run their own open source projects (e.g. VSCode), and actively sponsor and support many open source conferences, events, and initiatives. I know many people who work at Microsoft and they love the company and their work there. These are not microserfs: they are people like you and me. Things have changed, and I have literally never drunk Kool-aid; this or any other type. Are they perfect? No, but they don’t claim to be. But is the Microsoft of today a radically different company to the Microsoft of the late nineties. No doubt. Still though, this cynicism exists in some. Some see them as a trojan horse and ask if we can really trust them? A little while ago I had a discussion with someone who was grumbling about Microsoft. After poking around his opinion, what shook out was that his real issue was not with Microsoft’s open source work (he was supportive of this), but it was with the fact that they still produce...

CONTEXT: 12 de julio de 2010 La ex rehén y política colombiana, Íngrid Betancourt, dió marcha atrás en su reclamo multimillonario contra Colombia por los daños que sufrió cuando estuvo en poder de los rebeldes izquierdistas de las FARC. Betancourt exigió al gobierno de su país el pago de 6.800 millones de dólares por los cinco años que fue rehén de las fuerzas rebeldes. Ahora, la ex rehén restó importancia a su reclamo financiero durante una entrevista en televisión, pero insistió en que el Estado no la protegió cuando se postulaba para la presidencia. El vicepresidente colombiano, Francisco Santos, dijo que la afirmación de Betancourt se hace acreedora al premio mundial de la ingratitud. El gobierno retiró los guardaespaldas a Betancourt en 2002 durante su campaña presidencial después de advertirle que no viajara al departamento de Caquetá, en el sur de Colombia, donde fue tomada en rehén por los rebeldes. En 2008, Betancourt junto con otros 14 rehenes, fue liberada de las FARC en un rescate en el que fuerzas militares colombianas se hicieron pasar por representantes de la Cruz Roja.

News article: KTVU and wires      A hail of gunfire along an Oakland street and caught on tape has left seven people wounded, including a 1-year-old boy who authorities say was taken to the city's Children's Hospital in critical condition.      The gunfire broke out Monday evening in a liquor store parking lot after a crowd had gathered, police said. The victims were transported to local hospitals by others at the scene before officers arrived to find dozens of bullet casings.      The 1-year-old's father, who also was shot, drove his son to the hospital, where surgeons were trying to relieve swelling on his brain, relatives told KTVU-TV Monday night.      \\"We are aware of a 1-year-old boy who was shot -- possibly in the head -- in critical condition right now,\\" Oakland Police Lt. Robert Chan told the station. The hospital declined to release any details about the victim.      The shootings just after 6 p.m. happened near Interstate 880 in the city's West Oakland neighborhood, Oakland police spokeswoman Ofc. Johnna Watson said.      The other victims' conditions were unclear, though police said their injuries did not appear life-threatening. *(Though police originally reported that eight were wounded during the shooting, they corrected that count to seven Tuesday afternoon.)      Video from three different surveillance cameras obtained by KTVU revealed the chaotic scene. As the gunfire erupted, a group of people drove under tracks and ran for cover.      Investigators were seeking multiple shooters, but further details on suspects or a motive were still not available Tuesday.      Television footage showed a van belonging to an Oakland rapper that was riddled with bullet holes and had apparently taken some of the victims to the hospital.      The rapper, who goes by the name Kafani, posted to Twitter on Monday that he had not been shot but to pray for his little cousin. He said news reports that he had been shooting a music video when the shooting took place were incorrect. ||||| Click photo to enlarge «      1      2      3      4      5      »      OAKLAND -- When a 3-year-old boy was fatally wounded in a gang-related shooting three months ago in East Oakland, no one thought there could be a more devastating act of violence.      Monday night, in a liquor store parking lot in West Oakland, that notion proved tragically incorrect.      One-year-old Hiram Lawrence was in grave condition after he was shot in the head after the filming of a rap video. He was one of seven people wounded by gunfire. His father, who was holding the boy in his arms as he ran for cover, was one of the victims.      The distraught father, also named Hiram Lawrence, repeated, \\"My son got hit. My son got hit,\\" according to witnesses.      On Tuesday, the child, whose second birthday is Dec. 28, clung to life at Children's Hospital Oakland with his father and other relatives keeping vigil. Police, city officials and clergy members called on the community to step up to help find the gunmen and to work to end the senseless violence that has brought fear and sorrow to neighborhoods across the city.      Calling the child's shooting a \\"heinous crime,\\" interim police Chief Howard Jordan said Tuesday he was \\"outraged\\" and that such senseless violence \\"should not be tolerated by the community.\\" Jordan visited the little boy in his hospital room and brought him a teddy bear.      The community, in turn, was shaken by the magnitude of the violence that seemed to erupt out of nowhere Monday evening.      The boy, his father and about 20 others were in a liquor store parking lot in the 700 block of Willow Street about 6:30 p.m. Monday where a rap video had just finished taping, police said.      A store surveillance video showed at least three gunmen wearing gray hooded sweatshirts firing on the group, and at least two people in the crowd, including one who was wounded, returning fire, police said.      Besides the little boy, a 24-year-old woman and a man were also in critical condition while the other victims' injuries, including the boy's father who was shot in the thumb, were described as not being life-threatening.      Jordan told reporters that some \\"persons of interest\\" have been identified, but would not give additional details. No arrests have been made.      Sgt. Randy Wingate said the investigation has been somewhat stymied because some of the victims \\"are not as cooperative as we would like them to be.\\"      Even though police said at the news conference no motive for the shooting has been established, law enforcement sources said they cannot rule out the possibility the shooting is related to a long-standing violent dispute between two West Oakland gangs in the area. To prevent acts of retaliation, police Tuesday night significantly increased their presence in the gang areas.      Mayor Jean Quan also spoke at the briefing, saying \\"probably the saddest job I have as mayor\\" is talking to relatives of young people shot in the city.      She recalled talking with the father of Carlos \\"Carlito\\" Nava, a 3-year-old boy fatally shot Aug. 8 in the 6400 block of International Boulevard, the innocent victim of a gang-related shooting that wounded two intended targets.      Quan said community outrage over that shooting helped lead to the arrest of two suspects. She urged the community to step forward again.      \\"We can't allow children to be senseless victims of senseless violence. We can do something about it. It's a cycle we can end, a cycle we must end. Let's not let that code of silence continue. Help us end these senseless and cowardly acts.\\"      Councilwoman Nancy Nadel (Downtown-West Oakland), who represents the area of the shooting, said the \\"power of violence is so thwarted and wrong and is continually growing in low-income communities. We have to change that. The trend toward senseless violence is out of control and it cannot go on any longer.\\"      Speaking on behalf of the 70-church Pastors of Oakland was the group's first vice president, Pastor Gerald Agee of the Friendship Christian Center.      Agee said he was \\"tired of preaching eulogies\\" at homicide victims' funerals and wants only to \\"preach at marriages.\\"      \\"The taking of a life is wrong, especially a baby's,\\" he said. \\"We as a community have to do something to stop this. Let us as a community say enough is enough.\\"      Police said an Oakland rapper who goes by the name of Kafani was at the scene of the shooting in the 700 block of Willow Street, in the parking lot of a liquor store where dozens of people had gathered.      However, Kafani said Tuesday morning that he was not at the scene.      \\"I was not shot and was not at video! My cousin and his son was shot and he does music with me. A promo van that promotes my music was there,\\" Kafani said, responding by email to an inquiry from the Bay Area News Group.      Police said there may have been an argument shortly before the shooting.      Larry White, who lives across the street from the liquor store, described the scene as chaotic. He had just walked inside the door of his apartment building when he heard the shots and took cover behind the elevator. Once the shooting stopped, he said, he looked outside and saw a man screaming, holding a small child who was taken away in a black SUV.      In a biography posted on his personal website, Kafani.com, Kafani describes himself as a budding music mogul. In the bio, Kafani says, \\"I'm not trying to glorify shooting and killing. I'm rapping about the good life and letting my fans know there is a way out. I'm not trying to sound like anyone else. I'm just Kafani.\\"      A vigil for the little boy is planned Wednesday evening. No time was announced.      Up to 35,000 in reward money is being offered for information leading to the arrest of suspects in the shooting.      Police are asking anyone with information to call a special tip line at 510-773-2805.

The child and his father were both shot during an incident on an Oakland Street yesterday, when unknown gunmen opened fire on the crowd for motives that are not known.      A KTVU-TV news showed a van owned by rapper Kafani, that has been riddled with bullets.      According to a local news report, he was allegedly shooting a music video at the time of the gunfire, which occurred in a liquor store parking lot.      “I was not shot. News reports wrong I did not shoot a video today,” Kafani tweeted earlier this morning.      The one-year-old child is currently at Children’s Hospital in Oakland, where he underwent surgery, in an attempt to remove swelling from his brain.      Police are seeking motives as well as up to six suspects in the shootings.      The other seven victims’ injuries are believed to be non-life-threatening.      Kafani is an Oakland-based artist who hit big with the single “Fast (Like A Nascar.”      He has recorded tracks with rappers like Too hort, Yukmouth, Freeway and others.

Article: Women work harder than men at university and get better degrees as a result, according to a study at Brunel University. The research, which followed 200 students for four years, found that women consistently outperformed men in their studies even though they had started their courses with almost identical A-level grades. An analysis of the results showed that while 65 percent of female graduates were awarded, only 35 percent of male graduates did as well. Girls are known to outperform boys at school, but this research showed that trend continued at university. Fiona Smith, who led the research, said, \\"The research shows that the difference has something to do with schools in general.\\" \\"It also shows something about the inequality for working women in terms of pay and promotion. Women work harder at school, harder at university, and do better at both, but they still receive less pay.\\" The research found that female students were more faithful, less likely to miss lectures, and more likely to believe that their marks reflected their abilities than male students. Female students were also more likely to ask for and receive support from their professors. Women were also more likely to choose their universities because they liked the courses offered. In contrast, men were more likely than women to miss lectures due to \\"other affairs\\" and \\"laziness\\", and to believe that playing sports was an important part of university life. Generally, people think that women's success comes from more emphasis on coursework, but the research showed that female geographers at Brunel did better in their exams than in their coursework. Dr Smith said, \\"Most women feel that getting good grades is the most important part of university life. They believe that they need to work harder in order to compete in the male-dominated   environment they will encounter at work. Good grades are viewed as an 'insurance policy' for success. Men, on the other hand, prefer going out and playing sports to academic work.\\" \\"This research shows how... Question: Which of the following about men is TRUE according to the passage?

Mothers are using their newborn babies as an excuse to let themselves go and avoid exercise, according to this tough love personal trainer. Sydney-based trainer Allan Trinh believes new mums prioritise their kids over themselves and they end up missing out health-wise. 'They're letting go, they're not eating properly and they just don't care,' Mr Trinh told Daily Mail Australia. 'I don't think that's right. You have to be a role model to the kids.' Sydney-based trainer Allan Trinh believes mothers use their newborn babies as an excuse to let themselves go and avoid exercise. The 24-year-old mobile personal trainer said he expected to 'cop a lot of slack from mums' over his controversial stance but he was more concerned about his message. 'The three main excuses I hear are 'I'm too tired, I've got no time and my kids are my workout',' he said. 'I know mums are really busy and haven't had much sleep, but it's all about the kids and they don't prioritise themselves anymore. 'Before I start with them they're a mess, but how they come out of it is completely new women.' He said new mums let themselves go, don't eat properly and just don't care because their children are the main priority. Mr Trinh, who has run Personal Direct Training in Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney for almost four years, says a large proportion of his business are mums. 'I'm not a parent but I've been into the homes of a lot of mums - I've seen their lifestyles and the way they eat,' he said. 'I do sympathise with them. I will never go through pregnancy but I want to make a difference (with their health).' Mr Trinh said mums needed ­energy and only exercise could help with that.

The answer to the question: Which student feels he has moved from the second to the third echelon of students? is inside the article: James Hart starts his first year at Harvard Law School in a very bad way. In his contract law course with Professor Charles W. Kingsfield Jr., he assumes the first class will be an outline of the course. When Kingsfield immediately delves into the material using the Socratic method and asks Hart the first question, Hart is totally unprepared and feels so utterly humiliated that, after class, he throws up in the bathroom. Hart is invited to join a study group with five other students:  Franklin Ford, the fifth generation of Fords at Harvard Law School Kevin Brooks, a married man with a photographic memory, but no analytical skills Thomas Anderson Willis Bell, an abrasive individual who is devoted to property law O'Connor (Robert Lydiard)While out getting pizza, Hart is asked by a woman, Susan Fields, to walk her home, due to her feeling uncomfortable with a man who had been following her. Hart returns to her house soon after and asks her on a date, after which they begin a relationship. Their relationship is complex; she resents the time he devotes to his studies, while he expects her to provide him with a great deal of attention and wants a firm commitment. When Hart and his classmates are invited to a cocktail party hosted by Kingsfield, he is stunned to discover that Susan is Kingsfield's married daughter. (She is, however, separated from her husband and eventually gets a divorce.) She and Hart break up and get back together several times. Hart divides the class into three groups: those who have given up; those who are trying, but fear being called upon in class to respond to Kingsfield's questions; and the \\"upper echelon\\".

Question: Question: \\"Which intricate emotions did Turner come up with?\\"  Context: \\"A common way in which emotions are conceptualized in sociology is in terms of the multidimensional characteristics including cultural or emotional labels (e.g., anger, pride, fear, happiness), physiological changes (e.g., increased perspiration, changes in pulse rate), expressive facial and body movements (e.g., smiling, frowning, baring teeth), and appraisals of situational cues. One comprehensive theory of emotional arousal in humans has been developed by Jonathan Turner (2007: 2009). Two of the key eliciting factors for the arousal of emotions within this theory are expectations states and sanctions. When people enter a situation or encounter with certain expectations for how the encounter should unfold, they will experience different emotions depending on the extent to which expectations for Self, other and situation are met or not met. People can also provide positive or negative sanctions directed at Self or other which also trigger different emotional experiences in individuals. Turner analyzed a wide range of emotion theories across different fields of research including sociology, psychology, evolutionary science, and neuroscience. Based on this analysis, he identified four emotions that all researchers consider being founded on human neurology including assertive-anger, aversion-fear, satisfaction-happiness, and disappointment-sadness. These four categories are called primary emotions and there is some agreement amongst researchers that these primary emotions become combined to produce more elaborate and complex emotional experiences. These more elaborate emotions are called first-order elaborations in Turner's theory and they include sentiments such as pride, triumph, and awe. Emotions can also be experienced at different levels of intensity so that feelings of concern are a low-intensity variation of the primary emotion aversion-fear whereas depression is a higher intensity variant.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"In the context provided, Jonathan Turner, a notable sociologist, has developed a comprehensive theory of emotional arousal in humans. His research encompasses a wide range of emotion theories across various fields such as sociology, psychology, evolutionary science, and neuroscience. This extensive analysis allowed him to identify four primary emotions that are believed to be rooted in human neurology. These emotions are: assertive-anger, aversion-fear, satisfaction-happiness, and disappointment-sadness. Turner posits that these primary emotions can intermingle and interact to create more complex and elaborate emotional experiences. These more intricate emotions, referred to as first-order elaborations in Turner's theory, encompass a range of sentiments, including pride, triumph, and awe. It is essential to note that emotions can also manifest at varying levels of intensity. For example, feelings of concern are regarded as a low-intensity version of the primary emotion aversion-fear, while depression is a higher-intensity variant. The two key eliciting factors for the arousal of emotions within Turner's framework are expectation states and sanctions. Individuals entering a situation or encounter come with specific expectations about how it should transpire. The emotions they experience depend on the extent to which these expectations are met or unmet. Furthermore, the provision of positive or negative sanctions aimed at oneself or others can also incite different emotional experiences in individuals. In summary, Turner's theory not only recognizes the existence of distinct primary emotions but also acknowledges how these emotions can combine to create a broad spectrum of more intricate, first-order elaborations. This approach to understanding human emotions accommodates the complexity and depth of emotional experiences while also establishing a foundation upon which further research and analysis can build."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the years following its release, many reviewers considered To Kill a Mockingbird a novel primarily concerned with race relations. Claudia Durst Johnson considers it \\"reasonable to believe\\" that the novel was shaped by two events involving racial issues in Alabama: Rosa Parks' refusal to yield her seat on a city bus to a white person, which sparked the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott, and the 1956 riots at the University of Alabama after Autherine Lucy and Polly Myers were admitted (Myers eventually withdrew her application and Lucy was expelled, but reinstated in 1980).

At the beginning of the period, Australia and Antarctica remained connected, and warm equatorial currents mixed with colder Antarctic waters, distributing the heat around the world and keeping global temperatures high. But when Australia split from the southern continent around 45 Ma, the warm equatorial currents were deflected away from Antarctica, and an isolated cold water channel developed between the two continents. The Antarctic region cooled down, and the ocean surrounding Antarctica began to freeze, sending cold water and ice floes north, reinforcing the cooling.

Moreover, individuals aged 18 to 20 may possess alcohol (but not consume it) if it is part of their employment, such as working in a restaurant or other establishments where alcohol is served. It is important to note that the presence and supervision of a parent, legal guardian, or spouse who is of legal drinking age is necessary for the consumption of alcohol by those under 21, in order to adhere to Wisconsin's alcohol laws."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: LEEDS, England--A Leeds University psychology professor is researching a course to help dozens of Britons forgive their enemies. \\"The hate we hold within us is a cancer.\\" Professor Ken Hart said, adding that holding in anger can lead to problems such as high blood pressure and heart disease. More than 70 people have become volunteers in Hart's first 20-week workshop in London--a course he says is the first of its kind in the world. These are people who are sick and tired of living with a memory. They realize their bitterness is a poison they think they can pour out, but they end up drinking it themselves, said Canadian-born Hart. The students meet in each group of eight to ten for a two-hour workshop with a director every two weeks. The course, ending in July, is expected to get rid of the cancer of hate in these people. \\"People have lots of negative attitudes towards forgiveness,\\" he said, \\"People confuse forgiveness with forgetting. Forgiveness means changing from a negative attitude to a positive one.\\" Hart and his team have created instructions to provide the training needed. \\"The main idea is to give you guidances on how to look at all kinds of angers and how they affect you, and how to change your attitudes towards the person you are angry with,\\" said Norman Claringbull, a senior expert on the forgiveness project. Hart said, \\"I believe forgiveness is a skill that can be taught, as these people want to get free of the past.\\" Question: In Hart's first 20-week workshop, people there can   _  .

It ran during the flapper era of the 1920s into the early 1930s . The art was by Faith Burrows . Each panel exhibited a flapper wearing one of the current fashions , with a witticism typed at the bottom . Burrows drew her panels at an image size of 3 \`\` × 6 '' on Bristol boards measuring 3 \`\` × 6 '' . Burrows ' series ran in competition for a time with Ethel Hays ' similarly themed and well - established Flapper Fanny Says panel from NEA . As writers such as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Anita Loos , and illustrators such as Burrows , Hays , Russell Patterson and John Held Jr. popularized the flapper look and lifestyle through their works , flappers came to be seen as attractive , reckless and independent .  - Faith Swank Burrows (November 17, 1904  April 11, 1997) was a nationally syndicated cartoonist during the Jazz Age.  - The Jazz Age was a period in the 1920s, ending with the Great Depression, in which jazz music and dance styles became popular, mainly in the United States, but also in Britain, France and elsewhere. Jazz originated in New Orleans as a fusion of African and European music and played a significant part in wider cultural changes in this period, and its influence on pop culture continued long afterwards. The Jazz Age is often referred to in conjunction with the Roaring Twenties.  - A comic strip is a sequence of drawings arranged in interrelated panels to display brief humor or form a narrative, often serialized, with text in balloons and captions. Traditionally, throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, these have been published in newspapers and magazines, with horizontal strips printed in black-and-white in daily newspapers, while Sunday newspapers offered longer sequences in special color comics sections. With the development of the internet, they began to appear online as web comics. There were more than 200 different comic strips and daily cartoon panels in American newspapers alone each day for most of the 20th century, for a total of at least 7,300,000 episodes.  - An editorial cartoon, also known as a political cartoon, is an illustration containing a commentary that usually relates to current events or personalities. An artist who draws such images is known as an editorial cartoonist.  - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.  - Flappers were a generation of young Western women in the 1920s who wore short skirts, bobbed their hair, listened to jazz, and flaunted their disdain for what was then considered acceptable behavior. Flappers were seen as brash for wearing excessive makeup, drinking, treating sex in a casual manner, smoking, driving automobiles, and otherwise flouting social and sexual norms. Flappers had their origins in the liberal period of the Roaring Twenties, the social, political turbulence and increased transatlantic cultural exchange that followed the end of World War I, as well as the export of American jazz culture to Europe.  - The Roaring Twenties is a term for Western society and culture in the 1920s. It was a period of sustained economic prosperity with a distinctive cultural edge in the United States, Canada and Western Europe, particularly in major cities such as New York City, Montreal, Chicago, Detroit, Paris, Berlin, London and Los Angeles. In France and Quebec, it was known as the \\"\\"années folles\\"\\" (\\"Crazy Years\\"), emphasizing the era's social, artistic and cultural dynamism. Jazz music blossomed, the flapper redefined modern womanhood, Art Deco peaked, and, in the wake of hyper-emotional patriotism after World War I, normalcy returned to politics. This era saw the large-scale use of automobiles, telephones, motion pictures, radio, and electricity; commercial, passenger, and freight aviation; as well as unprecedented industrial growth, accelerated consumer demand, plus significant changes in lifestyle and culture. The media focused on celebrities, especially sports heroes and movie stars, as cities rooted for their home teams and filled the new palatial cinemas and gigantic sports stadiums. In most major democracies, women won the right to vote.  - Print syndication distributes news articles, columns, comic strips and other features to newspapers, magazines and websites.

Braces are the latest teenage fashion trend in Southeast Asia. Having a mouthful of metal has become so popular with Asian teens that there have been reports of many teens wearing fake  braces. Many Asian beauty shops are now offering to put in cheap fake braces. There are even cheaper do-it-yourself braces such as \\" Hello Kitty,\\" Mickey Mouse\\" or others for a price of around 100. Braces are considered a sign of wealth in Southeast Asia. A real set of braces in Bangkok, the capital city of Thailand, for example, will cost around  1,200, which is a large amount for the country with a GDP of 345 billion ( a billion is 1,000 million), compared to the US which had a GDP of 1,506 Trillion ( a Trillion is 1,000 billion) last year. While Asian teens may think that their colorful fake braces are cool, experts say that these trendy fashion braces can cause illness and can even lead to death. According to the New York Daily News, fake fashion braces have already been linked to the deaths of two teens in Thailand.A 17-year-old in the northeast city of Khon Kaen died from heart failure caused by a thyroid infection  from a pair of fake fashion braces.

So, when facing that challenge, it is important to know how to reach your weight-loss goal. Of course, you have to decide you want to lose weight and be committed to doing so; then, you must stick to your guns and stay motivated or the goal will never be realized. There is no magic bullet, but there are two important tips that can help you reach your weight-loss goal. #1 – Take It a Week at a Time You must break your ultimate goal into smaller chunks and have bench marks that will indicate you are moving in the right direction. According to the Mayo Clinic, “Over the long term, it’s best to aim for losing 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) a week.” When you have a realistic weekly weight-loss target, you will be more confident in your efforts and you will know exactly what you are going to measure at the end of each week. Your long-term goal may be 40 pounds, but take it “one week at a time” (1 to 2 pounds/week = 20 to 30 weeks) In addition to choosing a healthy diet that fits your lifestyle and current health conditions, plus a solid commitment to stay with it, don’t forget to get plenty of rest and exercise. . BUT . . .  the primary target should be the number of pounds you plan to lose each week. That target should be clear – and realistic. If it is, you should be able to stick to your weight loss program and enjoy success week after week, after week. AND, feel good in the process. If you are not hitting your target, be willing to look closely at what you are doing, or not doing – and figure out why you are not reaching your weekly target. Maybe the target you set was not sensible or reasonable; or, maybe you are putting too much pressure on yourself. Honest introspection is a good way to see what you are really capable of doing and then, you can develop or choose a plan that is suitable for your unique lifestyle.

M: Well, there are different things the court could do, but there's no guarantee. There's a good chance the court could award him compensation and orders to stop the manufacture and sale of goods. It may well be that the goods would be ordered to be destroyed.  W: Can the other person being sued do anything to help themselves?  M: That's the beauty of the whole thing.

W: You said the inventor is protected by the laws of the country. Is everything equal? Do all countries have the same law?  M: No, they're not all equal. You're right. It's only in theory.

The film takes place in England in 1865. Having been grotesquely disfigured in an African voodoo ceremony for a transgression against the native populace, Sir Edward Markham is kept locked in his room by his guilt-ridden brother, Julian. Tiring of his captivity, Sir Edward plots to escape by faking his death. With the help of the crooked family lawyer, Trench, they hire witchdoctor N'Galo to concoct a drug to put Sir Edward into a deathlike trance. Before Trench has time to act, Julian finds his \\"dead\\" brother and puts him in a coffin (the title's \\"oblong box\\"). Embarrassed by his brother's appearance, Julian asks Trench to find a proxy body for Sir Edward's lying in state. Trench and N'Galo murder landlord Tom Hacket and offer his corpse to Julian. After the wake, Trench and his young companion Norton, dispose of Hacket's body in a nearby river, while Julian has Sir Edward buried. Now free of his brother, Julian marries his young fiancée, Elizabeth, while Trench, Norton and N'Galo go their separate ways. Sir Edward is left buried alive until he is dug up by graverobbers and delivered to Dr. Newhartt. Newhartt opens the coffin and is confronted by the resurrected Sir Edward.

The speaker is advocating for a shift away from the current methods and tactics, which have apparently proven unsuccessful or have become obsolete, and is calling for a collective effort to reassess and reevaluate the situation.  When considering the hypothesis, \\"I want us to regroup and rethink,\\" it becomes essential to look at the intentions and desires expressed in the premise. Here, the speaker plainly states, \\"let's all of us regroup—and rethink,\\" which implies their inclination and desire for a collective reevaluation of the current situation.

New houses are untouched and fresh, which means they can suit your personality and you know exactly where all of the materials come from. New houses won't hold many unpleasant surprises, such as weak foundations, or other damaged areas. Most of these modern houses are also far more eco-friendly, with future decoration being just as easy to make and do as you like. Buying new houses is also a great way to save money, and you may find its benefit with the price going up in the future. Some buildings, such as those that are rare or in certain areas, are of value over the years. Sometimes it is the history that draws more buyers into older houses. A famous person may have lived there, or an important event may have taken place in the house. This may not add any value to the house, but it can add to the attraction. There may be more repairs which will need to be done in the old houses,so before you think you've found a great bargain, be sure to get a careful inspection. There are those who prefer building from the ground up. Building your own house can be a very rewarding, tiring, and expensive experience.

Language experts, however, will tell you that you're never too old to learn a new language. As you get older, it can be more difficult to learn a new language, though. Children and adults learn new languages in different ways. For children, language is their life. They study for thousands of hours every year, because they need to learn languages to become part of their communities. Adults, on the other hand, are already part of a language community. Learning a new language means becoming part of another language community, and adults rarely get the chance to practice as much as young children do. Moreover, children learning a new language are expected to make mistakes. This gives them freedom when learning to be daring and confident. Adults, however, often feel pressured to be perfect when learning a new language. This can discourage many people and make it even harder to learn a new language. When young children learn a new language, they come to see various languages as a \\"normal\\" part of society.

Article:The Herald of Free Enterprise was bound for the Port of Dover on 6 March 1987 when it capsized at Zeebrugge harbour in Belgium, killing 193 people. A remembrance service was held at St Mary's Church in Dover, where a memorial window marks the tragedy. Later, a rose garden was dedicated and flowers cast into the sea. During the service, the names of the 193 people who died in the disaster were read out. The service was attended by more than 250 bereaved family and friends, as well as some survivors of the tragedy. The Bishop of Dover, the Right Reverend Trevor Willmott, said: \\"Although time has passed, the scars from that day, physical, emotional and spiritual, will remain until the end of our lives.\\" The congregation was given stars on which to write messages. They will be transcribed into a book of remembrance. Also at the service was the Reverend Ken Martin, from Felixstowe, Suffolk, who was the first chaplain to arrive at the Naval Station at Zeebrugge. He said: \\"When I arrived there, I met a man who had lost his wife and son. The whole thing is as fresh today as it was back then.

Question: Information:  - Francisco \\"Pancho\\" Villa (born José Doroteo Arango Arámbula; 5 June 1878  20 July 1923) was a Mexican Revolutionary general and one of the most prominent figures of the Mexican Revolution.  - The United Nations (UN) is an intergovernmental organization to promote international co-operation. A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations, the organization was established on 24 October 1945 after World War II in order to prevent another such conflict. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; there are now 193. The headquarters of the United Nations is in Manhattan, New York City, and experiences extraterritoriality. Further main offices are situated in Geneva, Nairobi, and Vienna. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states. Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security, promoting human rights, fostering social and economic development, protecting the environment, and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine, natural disaster, and armed conflict.  - The Mexican Revolution was a major armed struggle that radically transformed Mexican culture and government. Although recent research has focused on local and regional aspects of the Revolution, it was a \\"genuinely national revolution.\\" Its outbreak in 1910 resulted from the failure of the 35-year long regime of Porfirio Díaz to find a managed solution to the presidential succession. This meant there was a political crisis among competing elites and the opportunity for agrarian insurrection. Wealthy landowner Francisco I. Madero challenged Díaz in 1910 presidential election, and following the rigged results revolted under the Plan of San Luis Potosí. Armed conflict ousted Díaz from power and a new election was held in 1911, bringing Madero to the presidency.  - North Africa or Northern Africa is the northernmost region of Africa. The United Nations definition of \\"North Africa\\" includes seven countries and territories; Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia, and Western Sahara. The countries of Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, and Libya are often collectively referred to as the Maghreb, which is the Arabic word for \\"sunset\\". Egypt lies to the northeast and encompasses part of West Asia, while Sudan is situated on the edge of the Sahel, to the south of Egypt.  - The Boxer Rebellion, Boxer Uprising or Yihequan Movement was a violent anti-foreign and anti-Christian uprising that took place in China between 1899 and 1901, towards the end of the Qing dynasty. It was initiated by the Militia United in Righteousness (\\"Yihetuan\\"), known in English as the \\"Boxers\\", and was motivated by proto-nationalist sentiments and opposition to imperialist expansion and associated Christian missionary activity.  - Edward Sinnott \`\` Tex '' O'Reilly ( 15 August 1880 -- 9 December 1946 ) was an American soldier of fortune who is said to have fought in ten wars under many flags . Initially serving in the U.S. Army in the Spanish -- American War and Philippine -- American War , as well as the Boxer Rebellion , he would claim to fight in Venezuela , Honduras and Nicaragua . He fought with Pancho Villa in Mexico and claimed to have fought in the Rif War with the Spanish Foreign Legion in North Africa , as well as serving as an international policeman in Shanghai . He became a writer , including as a reporter for the Associated Press . He wrote an autobiography , Roving and Fighting , and Lowell Thomas wrote Born to Raise Hell about him . The latter book has been reprinted and is distributed by The Long Riders ' Guild Press .  - The Spanish Civil War, widely known in Spain simply as The Civil War or The War, took place from 1936 to 1939 and was fought between the Republicans, who were loyal to the democratic, left-leaning and a relatively urban Second Spanish Republic in an alliance of convenience with the Anarchists, versus the Nationalists, a falangist, Carlist and a largely aristocratic conservative group led by General Francisco Franco. Although the war is often portrayed as a struggle between democracy and fascism, some historians consider it more accurately described as a struggle between leftist revolution and rightist counterrevolution. Ultimately, the Nationalists won, and Franco then ruled Spain for the next 36 years, from April 1939 until his death in November 1975.  - \\"Don\\" Miguel Primo de Rivera y Orbaneja, 2nd Marquis of Estella, 22nd Count of Sobremonte, Knight of Calatrava (January 8, 1870  March 16, 1930) was a dictator, aristocrat, and military officer who served as Prime Minister of Spain from 1923 to 1930 during Spain's Restoration era. He deeply believed that it was the politicians who had ruined Spain and that governing without them he could restore the nation. His slogan was \\"Country, Religion, Monarchy.\\" Historians depict him as an inept dictator who lacked clear ideas and political acumen, and who alienated his potential supporters such as the army. He did not create a base of support among the voters, and depended instead on elite elements. His actions discredited the king and ruined the monarchy, while heightening social tensions that led in 1936 to a full-scale Spanish Civil War.  - The Rif War, also called the Second Moroccan War, was fought in the early 1920s between the colonial power Spain (later joined by France) and the Berbers of the Rif mountainous region. Led by Abd al-Karim, the Riffians at first inflicted several defeats on the Spanish forces by using guerrilla tactics and captured European weapons. After France's entry into the conflict and the massive landing of Spanish troops at Al Hoceima, Abd el-Karim surrendered to the French and was taken into exile. Despite victory, controversy in Spain over the conduct of the war led to a military coup by Gen. Miguel Primo de Rivera in 1923 and foreshadowed the Spanish Civil War of 193639.

If For those who prefer something sweeter, shortbread (traditionally served at Yuletide and Hogmanay) is rich in butter and sugar., can we conclude that \\"Short bread is made with oranges and figs.\\"?","output":"No, we cannot conclude that \\"Shortbread is made with oranges and figs\\" based on the given information. The statement provided says that shortbread is traditionally served at Yuletide and Hogmanay and that it is rich in butter and sugar. It does not mention the inclusion of oranges and figs in the recipe. To clarify, shortbread is a type of traditional Scottish biscuit made primarily from flour, sugar, and butter. Its origins date back to medieval times, when it was derived from a type of bread known as \\"biscuit bread.\\" Over time, the recipe evolved into what we know today as shortbread. The classic shortbread recipe does not contain oranges or figs, but rather focuses on the three principal ingredients: flour, sugar, and butter. The high butter content gives the shortbread its crumbly and rich texture, while the sugar provides the sweetness. That being said, there are numerous variations on the traditional shortbread recipe, which can include additional flavors and ingredients such as chocolate, nuts, caramel, and various spices. In some variations, ingredients like orange zest, candied orange peel, or dried figs might be incorporated into the mixture to create a unique and different flavor profile. These adaptations, however, are personal preferences or modern twists on the classic recipe and not considered traditional. To sum up, we cannot conclude that shortbread is made with oranges and figs simply because it is sweeter and traditionally served at Yuletide and Hogmanay. The base recipe for shortbread does not include these ingredients, and their addition would represent a variation on the classic shortbread rather than a defining characteristic."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - The Gulf Stream, together with its northern extension towards Europe, the North Atlantic Drift, is a powerful, warm, and swift Atlantic ocean current that originates in the Gulf of Mexico and stretches to the tip of Florida, and follows the eastern coastlines of the United States and Newfoundland before crossing the Atlantic Ocean. The process of western intensification causes the Gulf Stream to be a northward accelerating current off the east coast of North America. At about , it splits in two, with the northern stream, the North Atlantic Drift, crossing to Northern Europe and the southern stream, the Canary Current, recirculating off West Africa.  - Gunnar Gunnarsson (18 May 1889  21 November 1975) was an Icelandic author who wrote mainly in Danish. He grew up, in considerable poverty, on Valþjófsstaður in Fljótsdalur valley and on Ljótsstaðir in Vopnafjörður. Despite great difficulties, he became one of the most popular novelists in Denmark and Germany.  - The Republic of Iceland, \\"Lýðveldið Ísland\\" in Icelandic, is a Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean. It has a population of and an area of , making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe. The capital and largest city is Reykjavík. Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate.  - A lava field, also called a lava plain or lava bed, is a large expanse of nearly flat-lying lava flows. Such features are generally composed of highly fluid basalt lava, and can extend for tens or even hundreds of miles across the underlying terrain. The extent of large lava fields is most readily grasped from the air or in satellite photos, where their typically dark, nearly black color contrasts sharply with the rest of the landscape. According to the US Geological Survey, monogenetic volcanic fields are collections of cinder cones, and/or Maar vents and associated lava flows and pyroclastic deposits. Sometimes a stratovolcano is at the center of the field, as at the San Francisco Volcanic Field in Arizona. Monogenetic volcano fields have systematic growth patterns that suggest they represent single magmatic systems in the same way that stratovolcanoes do, but monogenetic volcanoes grow laterally rather than vertically (Wood and Shoan, 1984). Detailed mapping indicates that some cinder cones in monogenetic fields (e.g., Cima, California, and Timber Mountain Volcanic Field, Nevada) may have had multiple eruptions separated by tens to hundreds of thousands of years (Wells, et al., 1989). Thus, some monogenetic cones may actually be polygenetic. This possibility differs from observations of historic eruptions (Wood, 1979), and is physically difficult to understand because cinder cone conduits are narrow and must solidify within a few years of eruption. Nonetheless, such multiple eruptions appear to have happened at least twice: Other cinder cones need to be closely reexamined.  - Fljótsdalur is a valley in east Iceland, formed by the Lagarfljót River. Lake Lagarfljót and the city of Egilsstaðir are located in the valley.  - Vopnafjörður is a village and municipality in Northeast Iceland, standing on a peninsula in the middle of a mountainous bay by the same name. The main industries of Vopnafjörður are fish processing, agriculture and tourism and other services.  - Sons of the Soil ( Danish : Borgslægtens historie , Icelandic : Saga Borgarættarinnar ) is a Danish film directed and shot by Gunnar Sommerfeldt in Iceland in 1919 , based on the novel by Gunnar Gunnarsson . It was released in 1921 .  - Reykjavík  is the capital and largest city of Iceland. It has a latitude of 64°08' N, making it the world's northernmost capital of a sovereign state, and is a popular tourist destination. It is located in southwestern Iceland, on the southern shore of Faxa Bay. With a population of around 130,000 (and over 200,000 in the Capital Region), it is the heart of Iceland's cultural, economic and governmental activity.

The Spirit tells that Ebenezer is ok, but in his past, there are other Blackadders who are quite miserly. Curious, Ebenezer asks to know more, and the Spirit goes into several flashbacks.The first vision shows how Lord Blackadder managed to con his way into great fortune and entitlement by tricking Queen Elizabeth (Miranda Richardson) into executing Lord Melchett (Stephen Fry).The second vision shows Edmund Blackadder tricking Prince Regent (Hugh Laurie) into giving up his valuable worldly goods to the poor.These visions intrigue Ebenezer, and he also wishes to see the future.

The union president says they copied the ad without the campaign's knowledge. A new radio ad bankrolled by an influential city union for mayoral candidate John Liu is raising eyebrows among government watchdogs who warn that it could set a dangerous precedent.

More than 2,000 people displaced by Superstorm Sandy are still living in hotels five months after the devastating natural disaster destroyed their New York City homes. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is paying on average 252 a night to house families and individuals from across the hurricane hit area. According to the New York Times, social service groups are hoping to get all those affected into a permanent home by the end of April but admit it may not be possible. Homeless: More than 2,000 victims of Superstorm Sandy are still living in hotels across New York City. Some experts say such accommodation will put pressure on individuals - leaving them in cramped conditions with no feeling of permanency. Others say it is just too expensive as a long-term solution. 'The problem with hotels is that it’s not a normal life — you can’t cook a meal,' said Martha J. Kegel, executive director of Unity of Greater New Orleans, a coalition that helped relocate residents after Hurricane Katrina, told the Times. 'You can’t even store much food. There’s going to be domestic violence because there’s not enough room. It’s not a good situation for people to be long-term.' Rosanne Haggerty, president of Community Solutions, a homelessness charity said: 'Why are we spending money on hotels instead of helping families pay the rent?' Devastation: Those still in hotels can't afford current housing available in New York City. Their previous homes were destroyed in the storm. 'For a fraction of the cost, families could be in a stable situation and getting a running start in putting their lives together.' Wanda Wilson, a mother-of-two made homeless after Sandy told the paper she hoped for a more permanent solution. 'The whole situation is really messed up. It’s a waste of money,' she said. Many of those affected by Sandy are too poor to afford available housing and have nowhere to return to because of the devastating impact of the storm. 43 per cent of those who registered for FEMA funding made less than 30,000 per year per household. The lack of available housing made hotels the only choice according to city officials. 'The hotels provided flexibility and availability that you can’t get anywhere else,' the city’s commissioner of homeless services Seth Diamond said. Recovery: Many of those affected by the storm were New York's poorest earning less than 30,000 per household. Support: Thousands needed help after the storm. People are pictured here waiting in line at a distribution site in Coney Island. It is hoped newly available public housing will plug the gap but in some instances families will also be given vouchers to subsidize 70 per cent of their rent. If the April 30 target is missed many of the families could end up back in homeless shelters, according to the Times. 'Shelter is one of many possibilities,' said Barbara Brancaccio, a spokeswoman for the city’s Department of Homeless Services. The ongoing difficulties in dealing with the 7,000 residents who went to evacuation centers following Hurricane Sandy on October 29, has prompted many to call for wholesale reform of the city's emergency disaster planning. 'The city may have been overly optimistic,' said Councilman Brad Lander. 'You need to have emergency rental vouchers ready to be deployed.' After Hurricane Katrina many of those made homeless were put in hotels for years. And there are many people affected by Sandy who may never get help. According to the Times, around two per cent of those in need are illegal immigrants who don't want to reveal their status to officials. On Friday, the Government announced 1.4billion in aid to New York transit agencies to help rebuild systems after Sandy. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1.

Summarize this article: Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland. Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the bank's global ambitions. It has retreated from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out. During that time, brand strategists have used 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands. It was backed with millions of pounds in sponsorship of international sport, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray. But now, it has been judged right to let more national brands come to the fore. Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not be initialised. In England and Wales, all RBS references, outside head office and the stock exchange listing, will be changed to NatWest. The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. There are other, smaller brands for private banking, which will get more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank. Mr McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire. He told BBC Scotland: \\"The RBS brand will end up becoming our investor brand and the one that our staff are employed with, because we are now becoming much more a bank of brands. \\"As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became the global brand. I'm now saying we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations. \\"Each one of those brands will stand for something quite different in their own communities, and our staff will work with customers under those brands.\\" RBS had already stated that it would not to continue its Six Nations sponsorship, and it has been raising the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship. \\"The time is right for us to move to the bank of brands, because underneath (we've been asking) how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers?\\" said the chief executive. \\"It would have been very cynical three years ago if we'd said we're going to be a great bank for customers and put those brands out there. \\"But with the work we've been doing, focussing on the customers needs, not our own, I think you're seeing a lot of change. \\"We can bring those brands back up again, so I think the time is right.\\"","output":"Royal Bank of Scotland's (RBS) CEO, Ross McEwan, announced that the bank will abandon the use of its RBS branding outside of Scotland, as it no longer has global ambitions, but rather focuses on local aspirations.

Such comments oversimplify the issue and can make the individual feel invalidated. 2. \\"You don't look like you have an eating disorder\\": Eating disorders affect people of all shapes, sizes, and appearances. Making such a statement can be invalidating and dismiss the seriousness of the person's struggles. 3. \\"You'll grow out of it\\" or \\"It's just a phase\\": Eating disorders are not something that someone will naturally \\"grow out of,\\" and such comments can minimize the severity of the condition. 4. Commenting on their appearance or weight: Even if intended as a compliment, any remark about the person's weight or appearance can trigger negative thoughts or feelings related to their eating disorder. 5. \\"I wish I had the willpower to diet like you\\" or \\"I wish I could eat whatever I want and not gain weight\\": These comments might glamorize or trivialize the person's struggles and can be triggering. 6. Comparing your own eating habits or weight concerns: Comparisons are generally unhelpful and can make the individual feel self-conscious or defensive. 7. \\"Can't you see what you're doing to yourself?\\": This might come off as accusatory and can make the person feel guilty, ashamed, or defensive, further eroding their self-esteem and confidence. Instead, focus on expressing understanding, care, and non-judgmental support, avoiding any comments that may inadvertently be hurtful or triggering to the individual. Encourage open conversation and, when appropriate, guide them towards professional help or support groups."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Patient C uses sunscreen, but patient D does not use any sunscreen. Patient E tans with tanning lamps, but patient F tans in the sun.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which patient would be more susceptible to skin cancer, patient E or patient C?  Hint: Making these healthy lifestyle choices can also help prevent some types of cancer. In addition, you can lower the risk of cancer by avoiding carcinogens , which are substances that cause cancer. For example, you can reduce your risk of lung cancer by not smoking. You can reduce your risk of skin cancer by using sunscreen. How to choose a sunscreen that offers the most protection is explained below ( Figure below ). Some people think that tanning beds are a safe way to get a tan. This is a myth. Tanning beds expose the skin to UV radiation. Any exposure to UV radiation increases the risk of skin cancer. It doesn’t matter whether the radiation comes from tanning lamps or the sun. The answer is:","output":"Patient E would be more susceptible to skin cancer than patient C. The given paragraph provides relevant information about cancer prevention, which helps in understanding the risks associated with certain behaviors, such as smoking, using sunscreen, and tanning methods. Patient C uses sunscreen, which is a healthy lifestyle choice that helps prevent skin cancer. Sunscreen contains ingredients that protect the skin from harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation emitted by the sun. Based on the hint provided, using sunscreen can significantly lower the risk of skin cancer. By applying sunscreen regularly, patient C is taking a proactive approach to minimize their risk of skin cancer. On the other hand, patient E tans with tanning lamps as opposed to natural sunlight. The paragraph debunks the myth that tanning beds are a safe way to get a tan. Tanning beds expose the skin to UV radiation, which is known to increase the risk of skin cancer. UV radiation in tanning lamps is often more intense and concentrated than sunlight, making it even more dangerous for the skin. Whether the exposure comes from tanning lamps or the sun, the risk of skin cancer increases with UV radiation exposure. Since patient E uses tanning lamps, they are putting themselves at a higher risk for skin cancer compared to patient C, who takes preventive measures by using sunscreen."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Stephen Russell Davies was born on 27 April 1963 at Mount Pleasant Hospital in Swansea. His father, Vivian Davies (1925-2015), and his mother, Barbara (1929-1999), were teachers. Davies was the youngest of three children and their only son. Because he was born by C-section, his mother was placed on a morphine drip and was institutionalised after an overdose resulted in a psychotic episode. Davies' next project was The Grand, a period soap drama set in a Manchester hotel during the interwar period. It was designed to be a valuable show in a ratings war with the BBC and was scheduled at 9 pm on a Friday night. After the original writer abandoned the series, Granada approached him to write the entire show. His scripts for the first series reflect the pessimism of the period; each episode added its own emotional trauma on the staff, including a soldier's execution for desertion, a destitute maid who threatens to illegally abort her unborn child to survive, and a multi-episode storyline centred on the chambermaid, Monica Jones (Jane Danson), who kills her rapist in self-defence, is arrested, and eventually hanged for murder. The show was renewed for a second series despite the first's dark tone.  The second series had a lighter tone and greater emphasis on character development, which Davies attributed to his friend Sally, who had previously warned him of the adult humour in Breakfast Serials; she told him that his show was too bleak to be compared to real life. He highlighted the sixth and eighth episodes of the second series as a time of maturity as a writer: for the sixth, he utilised then-unconventional narrative devices such as flashbacks to explore the hotel barman's closeted homosexuality and the societal attitudes towards sexuality in the 1920s; and he highlighted the eighth as when he allowed the series to \\"take on its own life\\" by deliberately inserting plot devices such as McGuffins to enhance the comic relief of the series.  Although well received, the series' ratings were not high enough to warrant a third series. After its cancellation in September 1997, Davies had an existential crisis after almost dying from an accidental overdose; the experience persuaded him to detoxify and make a name for himself by producing a series that celebrated his homosexuality. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: what is the grand?","output":"The Grand is a period soap drama set in a Manchester hotel during the interwar period.

Container A has been heating up for a long amount time, while container B has only been heating up for a short amount of time.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which container has particles with lower average kinetic energy?  Hint: As a liquid is heated, the average kinetic energy of its particles increases. The rate of evaporation increases as more and more molecules are able to escape the liquid’s surface into the vapor phase. Eventually a point is reached when the molecules all throughout the liquid have enough kinetic energy to vaporize . At this point the liquid begins to boil. The boiling point is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid is equal to the external pressure. The Figure below illustrates the boiling of liquid. A:","output":"Container B has particles with lower average kinetic energy compared to container A. This is because, based on the given information, container A has been heating up for a longer period of time than container B. Heating up a substance leads to increased kinetic energy in its particles, as mentioned in the hint that the average kinetic energy of its particles increases as the substance is heated. Given that container A has been exposed to heat for a longer duration, it stands to reason that its particles will have attained a higher average kinetic energy than those in container B, which has been heated for a shorter duration. Therefore, container B, having been heated less, contains water particles with a lower average kinetic energy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Presley's physical attractiveness and sexual appeal were widely acknowledged. \\"He was once beautiful, astonishingly beautiful\\", in the words of critic Mark Feeney. Television director Steve Binder, no fan of Presley's music before he oversaw the '68 Comeback Special, reported, \\"I'm straight as an arrow and I got to tell you, you stop, whether you're male or female, to look at him. He was that good looking. And if you never knew he was a superstar, it wouldn't make any difference; if he'd walked in the room, you'd know somebody special was in your presence.\\" His performance style, as much as his physical beauty, was responsible for Presley's eroticized image. Writing in 1970, critic George Melly described him as \\"the master of the sexual simile, treating his guitar as both phallus and girl\\". In his Presley obituary, Lester Bangs credited him as \\"the man who brought overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in America\\". Ed Sullivan's declaration that he perceived a soda bottle in Presley's trousers was echoed by rumors involving a similarly positioned toilet roll tube or lead bar.While Presley was marketed as an icon of heterosexuality, some cultural critics have argued that his image was ambiguous. In 1959, Sight and Sound's Peter John Dyer described his onscreen persona as \\"aggressively bisexual in appeal\\".

The reviewer highlights several aspects of the movie that they found unsatisfactory, including the director's desire to \\"sound American,\\" the complicated plot, the choice of actors, and the scenes with the protagonist's pregnant wife. The review even goes so far as to call the movie's conclusion \\"violent and absurd,\\" and suggests that the epilogue might make a nice commercial for the Côte d'Azur, which implies that it's not well-suited for the film itself. The negative sentiment extends to the comparison with other movies and genres, as well as the disappointment in the actors' performances. The reviewer clearly expected more from the thriller genre and was left underwhelmed by the French cinema's attempt to make an engaging and suspenseful film. Mentioning the PG-12 rating in relation to the content seems to be an additional criticism, implying that the movie was targeting a younger audience without delivering a powerful and fulfilling cinematic experience for all viewers. Furthermore, the use of phrases such as \\"the silence of the lame\\" and \\"astoundingly dumb\\" in reference to the film showcases the overall negative sentiment of the review. This harsh language and the reviewer's evident dissatisfaction with multiple aspects of the movie express an undeniably negative perspective. In conclusion, the sentiment of this review is unquestionably negative, as it criticizes various elements of the movie, which include the plot, performances, and atmosphere. The reviewer's disappointment in the French cinema's ability to create a compelling thriller clearly conveys a negative opinion about the film."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

It is familiar to millions of television viewers all over the world every year who watch the Last Night of the Proms, where it is traditionally performed. When the theme of the slower middle section (technically called the \\"trio\\") of the first march came into his head, he told his friend Dora Penny, \\"I've got a tune that will knock 'em – will knock 'em flat\\". When the first march was played in 1901 at a London Promenade Concert, it was conducted by Henry J. Wood, who later wrote that the audience \\"rose and yelled ... the one and only time in the history of the Promenade concerts that an orchestral item was accorded a double encore.\\" To mark the coronation of Edward VII, Elgar was commissioned to set A. C. Benson's Coronation Ode for a gala concert at the Royal Opera House in June 1901. The approval of the king was confirmed, and Elgar began work. The contralto Clara Butt had persuaded him that the trio of the first Pomp and Circumstance march could have words fitted to it, and Elgar invited Benson to do so. Elgar incorporated the new vocal version into the Ode. The publishers of the score recognised the potential of the vocal piece, \\"Land of Hope and Glory\\", and asked Benson and Elgar to make a further revision for publication as a separate song. It was immensely popular and is now considered an unofficial British national anthem. In the United States, the trio, known simply as \\"Pomp and Circumstance\\" or \\"The Graduation March\\", has been adopted since 1905 for virtually all high school and university graduations.In March 1904 a three-day festival of Elgar's works was presented at Covent Garden, an honour never before given to any English composer. The Times commented, \\"Four or five years ago if any one had predicted that the Opera-house would be full from floor to ceiling for the performance of an oratorio by an English composer he would probably have been supposed to be out of his..., can you guess it ?

However, because calcium is absorbed rather inefficiently by the intestines, high serum calcium is more likely caused by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or possibly by excessive intake of vitamin D, both which facilitate calcium absorption. It may also be due to bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasize within bone. All these conditions result in excess calcium salts being deposited in the heart, blood vessels, or kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia typically leads to calcification of soft tissue and its serious consequences: for example, calcification can cause loss of elasticity of vascular walls and disruption of laminar blood flow—and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Conversely, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intakes may result in hypocalcaemia, often caused also by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective PTH receptors in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, which potentially causes tetany and disruption of conductivity in cardiac tissue.  Two friends went to the doctor because they weren't feeling well. As it turns out Danny had a condition called hypercalcaemia, while Greg had hypocalcaemia.  Which friend hadn't taken enough calcium?

Turn the knob to the desired temperature, likely in the 375 to 400 range by turning the knob with your hand.;","output":"Option B makes more sense to accomplish the goal of prepping the oven to bake pizza. Here's the step-by-step process and justification: 1. Check the pizza recipe or instructions: Before preheating the oven, it is crucial to know the recommended temperature to bake the pizza. This will ensure optimal cooking. 2. Turn the oven knob: Option B specifically refers to turning the knob for temperature adjustment. The clock dial mentioned in Option A is not relevant to setting the oven temperature, as it serves a different purpose (usually to set a timer or adjust the clock time). 3. Set the desired temperature: Based on the pizza recipe or instructions, turn the oven knob to the recommended temperature, which is likely to be in the range of 375 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. This ensures that the oven temperature is appropriate for baking the pizza. 4. Allow the oven to preheat: Give the oven enough time to reach the target temperature before placing the pizza inside. This usually takes about 10-15 minutes, depending on the oven. Preheating ensures even cooking and helps the pizza crust become crispy on the outside while staying tender on the inside. 5. Prepare the pizza for baking: While the oven is preheating, use this time to prepare the pizza by adding toppings and ensuring it is ready for baking. 6. Once the oven has reached the desired temperature, place the pizza inside and start the baking process. In summary, Option B is more logical and efficient as it focuses on the temperature knob required to prep the oven for baking pizza."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: The city retains its spotless streets, immaculate shops and nonexistent crime rate. Since the slowdown, only one manufacturing company has gone bankrupt, says the city's Chamber of Commerce and Industry, because Toyota spread out orders among many of the more than 400 auto parts factories in the city, to keep them afloat through hard times. Nonetheless, Toyota's downturn has rippled through the city's economy, idling many smaller auto-related suppliers, which also cut payrolls, mainly by refusing to renew the contracts of short-term workers. After losing their jobs, many of the city's 16,400 foreign residents, mostly ethnic Japanese from Brazil and Latin America, packed up and left, residents and city officials said. Hypothesis: Toyota's is the town's market driver.","output":"Based on the provided context, the hypothesis \\"Toyota is the town's market driver\\" can be well-supported and drawn for multiple reasons.  1. Toyota's impact on the auto parts industry: The text mentions that Toyota spread out orders among more than 400 auto parts factories in the city to help keep them afloat during difficult times. This demonstrates a direct influence of Toyota on the economic well-being of many businesses in the city, which supports the idea that Toyota is the market driver in this town. 2. Indirect impact on smaller suppliers: The effects of Toyota's downturn were not limited to the auto parts factories; it also impacted smaller auto-related suppliers that subsequently had to cut payrolls and let go of short-term workers. This ripple effect provides further evidence that Toyota is a major market driver in the city, as its performance has significant consequences for other local businesses. 3. Impact on the foreign community: After job losses due to the slowdown, many of the city's 16,400 foreign residents, mostly ethnic Japanese from Brazil and Latin America, had to leave the city. This exemplifies how Toyota's economic influence extends beyond local businesses and affects the area's demographics, driving people to migrate based on the stability of job opportunities in the town. 4. Nonexistent crime rate: The context states that the city has maintained a nonexistent crime rate. While not directly mentioning Toyota, it can be hypothesized that the company's presence and influence result in numerous jobs and opportunities, which may contribute positively to keeping the crime rate low. 5. Role of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry: The context also mentions the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which highlights Toyota's bankruptcy story as a unique case during the downturn. This suggests that the organization recognizes the company's significant role in the city's economy. Based on these points, it is reasonable to conclude that Toyota is indeed the town's market driver. The company's actions and performance have direct and indirect consequences on the local economy, affecting businesses, workers, and residents. As Toyota's success goes, so does the well-being and stability of the city."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Luckily I was not the target or victim of this road rage, but I was a first hand witness. Back in the mid 1990s when I worked in Southern California, I was returning from lunch one day with a coworker when we noticed two pickup trucks driving erratically. This was on Valley View Blvd in Cerritos which is a large roadway divided (by a large, planted median strip) with 3 lanes on either side. One truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot. At this point, I was parallel with the shooter’s truck and only about 50–60 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, “Oh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!” I floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could.

Movie plot title: Make It Happen Movie plot: The movie opens in Glenwood, Indiana, where Lauryn Kirk (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) narrates the first few parts. There are no dance schools in Glenwood and Lauryn says goodbye to her brother, Joel (John Reardon) before departing for Chicago to audition for a famous dance school, the fictional Chicago School of Music and Dance. Although Joel, who works as a mechanic in the family garage, is wary of Lauryn's decision to enroll, he eventually gives her his blessing. When Lauryn enters the stage, however, her dance (mostly a hip hop routine) was halted by the judge, who hostilely rejects her, saying that they need to see something more \\"sensual and feminine\\". Dejected, Lauryn goes to a diner to down her sorrows, but soon finds her car towed off. Upon seeing her misfortunes, Dana (Tessa Thompson), a friendly waitress from the diner invites Lauryn to her apartment and out of the pouring rain. Dana subsequently offers Lauryn a place to stay, considering Lauryn could not go back home and face her brother. The next day, Dana brings Lauryn to a club called Ruby's (whose dances are rooted in burlesque), where she meets with Russ (Riley Smith), the slick-talking disc jockey, and Brenda (Karen LeBlanc), the club owner. Brenda hires Lauryn as a bookkeeper, in light of her skills with numbers. Lauryn watches as a dancer, Carmen (Julissa Bermudez) performs impressively on the stage. Before locking up late one night, Lauryn goes on the stage and silently and elegantly dances, while unbeknownest to her, Russ watches from a distance. The next night, Brenda finds herself short of dancers. Russ asks Lauryn to dance, after having seen her graceful performance the previous night. Lauryn reluctantly agrees, and goes on stage.

Plot title: The Warriors Movie plot: As night falls over Coney Island, Cleon (Dorsey Wright), leader of the Warriors, meets up with eight of his most trusted lieutenants to travel by subway to the faraway Bronx. They will be attending an event called by a man named Cyrus, described as \\"the one and only.\\" Throughout the city, other gang delegations are seen entering the subway in their full colors. As the Warriors speculate about the event during their subway ride, we learn that Cyrus, leader of the largest gang in the city, the Gramercy Riffs, has called a truce of all the gangs in New York. He wants an unarmed delegation of nine from each gang to come to a mass meeting to hear what he has to say. Some of the Warriors are excited at the prospect, while others are skeptical.At Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, the meeting is well-attended with over 100 gangs represented. The charismatic Cyrus (Roger Hill) takes the stage and delivers a spellbinding speech. He says that, instead of fighting each other over turf, they could unite to form an army of 60,000 soldiers, compared to only 20,000 police in the whole city. He punctuates his points with \\"Can you dig it?\\" to the crowd's wild response. Outside the meeting area, the police are seen silently moving in.Most of the crowd is enthralled with Cyrus' vision, but one member has his own agenda. Luther (David Patrick Kelley), the leader of a gang called the Rogues, has snuck a gun into the gathering. At a high point in the speech, Luther fires at Cyrus, killing him instantly. When Cyrus falls back, there is a brief stunned silence, followed by pandemonium. The crowd was so fixated on Cyrus that hardly anyone saw who fired the shot, but Luther turns to see that Fox (Thomas G. Waites) of the Warriors witnessed the assassination, so he points the gun to kill Fox.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Ronaldo Luiz Nazario de Lima was born on 22 September 1976 in a poor suburb of Rio de Janeiro. Like most of his childhood friends, Ronaldo began his soccer career playing barefoot in the streets of his neighborhood. At the age of 14, he joined SCristovo soccer club and only two years later became the star of Cruzeiro Belo Horizonte scoring a total of 58 goals in 60 matches and earning himself a reputation for his explosive pace and outstanding finishing skills. His goal-scoring record and unusual _ led him to be included in the Brazilian World Cup winning team the following year. After the World Cup, many top European football clubs were trying to sign him. Many people, including Brazilian football legend Pele, referred to him as the most promising footballer of his generation. Since his transfer to Dutch team PSV Eindhoven, Ronaldo's biography is one of success after success. Two Copa America s, a UEFA Cup, a Dutch Cup, a Spanish League Cup, and two awards as best player in the world, all in the space of two years, are some of Ronaldo s impressive achievements. On arrival to Inter-Milan in 1997, Ronaldo became the idol of the local fans who refer to him as \\"il Fenomeno.\\" Since the 98 World Cup he has suffered two serious knee injuries that have severely limited his appearances. Just when people began to wonder whether Ronaldo would be able to continue with his football career, he proved to the world that he still could play. In the World Cup held in Korea and Japan, the magical striker won the Golden Shoe award and tied Pele's Brazilian record for career World Cup goals with 12.

Answer the following question: when did the canon 5d mark ii come out?","output":"The Canon EOS 5D Mark II, a highly acclaimed digital SLR camera, was officially announced by Canon Inc. on September 17, 2008, and it became available for purchase in the market shortly after in late November 2008. This camera was a successor to the original Canon EOS 5D, released in 2005, and introduced a plethora of noteworthy improvements and features that solidified its position as a favorite among professional photographers and enthusiasts alike. The Canon 5D Mark II was a game-changer in the world of digital photography, as it brought innovative features and leading-edge technology to the market. It was equipped with a 21.1-megapixel full-frame CMOS sensor, which was a significant upgrade from the 12.8-megapixel sensor in its predecessor. This allowed for higher resolution images and better performance in low-light conditions. The Mark II also boasted an impressive ISO range from 100 to 6400, which could be expanded to 50-25,600, allowing for incredible low-light capability. One of the most groundbreaking features of the 5D Mark II was its ability to shoot full HD (1080P) video. This was the first Canon DSLR with this feature, which opened up new possibilities for photographers to capture video as well as stills. This made the camera popular not only among photographers but also among videographers, filmmakers, and other content creators. The Canon 5D Mark II also featured an enhanced auto-focus system with 9 AF points, including one central cross-type point, providing faster and more accurate focusing. Additionally, it had a slightly larger 3.0-inch LCD monitor with 920,000 dots, an improvement over the original 5D's 2.5-inch screen. The camera also supported Live View shooting, allowing users to compose photos and videos using the LCD screen rather than the optical viewfinder. The camera was well-received by critics and users alike for its excellent image quality, video capabilities, and overall performance. The Canon 5D Mark II became a milestone in the photography world, inspiring various other manufacturers to pursue the integration of professional video capabilities into their DSLR cameras. Its success spurred Canon to continue updating the series, with the 5D Mark III released in March 2012 and the 5D Mark IV in September 2016."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Some people think that if they ignore the mental illness, it will go away. No one in the family should ignore your husband’s bipolar. Your husband should not ignore his mental illness by refusing to accept it or getting treatment. You should not ignore it and pretend that your husband is okay. This can lead to problems later. If you have to, grieve for the fact that your husband has bipolar. Grieving may be part of the acceptance and coping process. Dealing with a bipolar husband can be difficult, so give your time to adjust to the new challenge in your life. Though you may have to make adjustments and sacrifices because your husband has bipolar, that does not mean that your life should be only about your husband. You should not live for him. You should be your own person, with your own interests and your own life. Pursue hobbies, your career, and personal goals. Don’t sacrifice yourself. Remember that you are a human being who deserves a good life. You deserve to take care of yourself in addition to your husband. Having your life revolve only around your husband can cause a lot of problems for both of you. When your husband deals with bipolar disorder, you may feel uncomfortable reaching out for support because you are afraid you and your husband will be judged. However, you should seek support from trusted family members or friends. Finding people you trust can help relieve the burden on both of your shoulders. If you don’t want to turn to people you know, you can try to find a support group in your community. This can provide a safe space for you to talk about being married to a bipolar husband without the fear of any negative response.

Your husband has something called bipolar disorder, which can make it hard to know how to help him. It's important for both of you to accept it and find help.

Question: Why might someone purposefully be going into trance? Options:  A. meditation  B. nothing  C. confused  D. epilepsy  E. meditate Answer:","output":"Option A. Meditation is the most in line with common sense as to why someone might purposely be going into a trance. Meditation is an ancient practice that has been utilized for thousands of years, across different cultures and traditions. Its primary purpose is to promote relaxation, focus, self-awareness, and create a sense of inner peace and balance. Meditation can be done in various forms, such as mindfulness, concentration meditation, transcendental meditation, or guided meditation, among others. All these methods involve deliberate efforts to focus the mind and enter a state of deep relaxation or contemplation. When one meditates, they often enter a trance-like state, where they are more focused, relaxed, and detached from the external environment and internal mental chatter. Entering such a state intentionally has various benefits, which may include: 1. Reduced stress and anxiety: By focusing on the present moment and promoting relaxation, meditation can help relieve people of stress and anxiety. 2. Improved concentration and focus: Training the mind during meditation can enhance one's ability to concentrate and maintain focus on tasks. 3. Emotional regulation and self-awareness: Meditation enables individuals to better understand their thoughts, emotions, and reactions, making it easier to manage their feelings and respond to situations in a calm and balanced manner. 4. Health benefits: When practiced routinely, meditation has been shown to lower blood pressure, boost immune function, and improve overall wellness. 5. Spiritual growth: For many, meditation is not only a means for relaxation but also a way to connect with their spiritual selves, explore existential questions, or grow closer to a higher power. These are some of the reasons why someone might purposefully enter a trance through practices like meditation. Although options B, C, and D involve different states of mind or situations, they are not in line with common sense as to why someone would intentionally go into a trance.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person whose illness led to his death?, using the article: The one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno for the best such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\"  Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works. He considered staging Il tabarro in combination with his own early work Le Villi, or with other two-act operas which might be used to round out the evening's..., what would be the answer ?

Read the following context and answer the question. Context: SEOUL — In addition to growing concerns that North Korea will pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S., prospects for improved inter-Korean relations have also stalled, as Pyongyang demands that U.S.-South Korea joint military drills be scaled back, and a group of defectors be returned. Just weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in declared the beginning of a new era of peace during a historic summit held in the demilitarized zone of the inter-Korean border, Pyongyang has put further dialogue and cooperation on hold until its demands are met. President Moon will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the upcoming Trump-Kim summit and the North’s sudden conditions set for continued dialogue and cooperation. Most of North Korea’s anger last week, expressed in official statements and reports carried by the state news agency KCNA, seemed to be directed at the U.S. It criticized the Max Thunder joint military exercise that is currently underway, and U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton’s demands for the North’s unilateral nuclear disarmament. North Korea in particular objected to Bolton’s insistence that North Korea follow the Libyan model, which involved the rapid and total dismantlement of that country’s nuclear program, but it was also followed by the overthrow of the country’s leader Moammar Gadhafi some years later. Unless the U.S. eased up on its uncompromising stance, Pyongyang indicated it would pull out of the June 12 meeting in Singapore between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump to negotiate an end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. President Trump later said the Libya model does not apply to North Korea and that Kim Jong Un would remain in power and “be very rich” if he makes a deal to end his country’s nuclear program. North Korea denounced South Korea, as well, for the joint military drills, calling the Seoul government... Question: Who is the North Korean leader?

From the moment Julie Andrews ran through the Austrian countryside, arms stretched wide and declaring that the \\"hills are alive with the sound of music\\", millions fell in love. The heartwarming love story of singing nun meets handsome captain, told through a host of chirpy, addictive songs has both an enthusiastic fan following and widespread family appeal. But what is it that the fans love so much? Musical theatre superfan Keith Milward, from Swansea, says it's that tale of romance that got him hook, line and sinker. \\"It's such a great story. It has just got everything you want and even across the generations people have always responded to the loveliness of it.\\" The seemingly innocent and wholesome plotline sees young nun Maria sent out of her convent to be the governess of the seven cute von Trapp children. A few Do-Re-Mis later and Maria and the children's navy captain father, played by Christopher Plummer, have fallen in love. But then they have to flee the Nazis during the annexation of Austria. So far, so gloriously far-fetched, you might think. But actually the story was based on the memoir of the real-life Maria von Trapp. Published in 1949, the book was later turned into a stage musical by Rodgers and Hammerstein before the film came along in 1965. You would think even the hardest of souls would be softened by such a hefty dose of syrupy sentimentality but reviews at the time were lukewarm. Critics were keen to point out the historical inaccuracies of the film, claiming it glossed over Austria's role in World War Two. One eminent critic, Pauline Kael, condemned it as a \\"sugar-coated lie that people seem to want to eat\\". Source: IMDB / Official Charts But current film critic Richard Fitzwilliam says audiences completely disagreed. \\"There was just something so romantic about it. Musical films were really taking off and people liked seeing them on the wide-screen. It was completely different to the swords and sandals epics that were also popular at the time but it was just pure escapism. It was also perfect for families to watch together. \\"Some said it was too schmaltzy and sentimental but it was hugely successful.\\" So while the film might score few points for factual accuracy, it's not the nuances of the plotline that has kept fans entertained for over five decades. It's the songs. The Sound of Music soundtrack album was the UK's best-selling LP, not just in 1965, but in 1966 and 1968. \\"They are just so infuriatingly hummable,\\" Richard Fitzwilliam says. \\"Just talking about the film,  I can hear the songs like the Lonely Goatherd, Sixteen Going on Seventeen and I'm tapping along and mumbling the lyrics.\\" \\"It's like a test,\\" Keith Milward says. \\"You can say to anyone in the street 'Do a deer, a female deer' and they'd know the tune and respond with the next line. \\"Even the most cynical will be swayed once they hear the music. I saw a touring production of it at the Swansea Grand just a couple of weeks ago and everyone was singing along. \\"The BBC even said that, should the end of the world be on its way, they would play the Sound of Music, so they must have thought it would brighten even the darkest of days.\\" And it seems that might be true... to some extent. It is believed that, at the height of Cold War paranoia, the film was selected by TV executives to be broadcast as part of a series of recorded programming in the event of a nuclear strike. In 2006, the master of the musicals, Lord Lloyd-Webber, brought the story right back into the popularity stakes with a TV contest to find an undiscovered performer to play Maria in a new West End production. Meanwhile, a sing-a-long version of the film still attracts hundreds of people every month. At the Prince Charles Cinema in London, fans turn up dressed as nuns and von Trapp children ready to sing their hearts out. Many fans hope the original film won't be subjected to a Hollywood remake.  \\"It shouldn't be touched,\\" Fitzwilliam says. \\"There are so many enduring memories that come with it and the original is still so good.\\" So good indeed that last year to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the cult classic, Lady Gaga took to the stage at the Oscar's to belt out a Sound of Music medley. For those still not convinced, you may be pleased to hear that actor Christopher Plummer was for many years unimpressed by the film that he became well-known for, famously referring to it as the \\"Sound of Mucus\\". But despite his misgivings, even he can understand its enduring appeal. Last year he told Vanity Fair magazine: \\"As cynical as I always was about The Sound of Music, I do respect that it is a bit of relief from all the gunfire and car chases you see these days. \\"It's sort of wonderfully, old-fashionedly universal. It's got the bad guys and the Alps; it's got Julie and sentiment in bucketloads. Our director, dear old Bob Wise, did keep it from falling over the edge into a sea of treacle.\\" This article was about:","output":"The enduring appeal of the musical movie, \\"The Sound of Music.\\" The film, released in 1965, follows the heart-warming love story of a singing nun, Maria, who becomes the governess of seven children and ultimately falls in love with their father, Captain von Trapp. While the plot itself is based on the memoir of the real-life Maria von Trapp, it is the film's music, written by Rodgers and Hammerstein, that has embedded itself in popular culture. Despite criticisms at the time of its release for being historically inaccurate and overly sentimental, the allure of the movie has been tied to its romantic narrative and the catchy, addictive songs. The soundtrack album was the UK's best-selling LP in 1965, 1966, and 1968. Fans have continued to celebrate and enjoy the film over the past five decades, attending sing-along versions of the screenings, dressing up as the characters, and maintaining its preservation against potential Hollywood remakes.  Notable figures like Keith Milward, Richard Fitzwilliam, and even Lord Lloyd-Webber have expressed their love for the film, citing its perfect mix of romance, musical appeal, and escapism. Even actor Christopher Plummer, famous for his role as Captain von Trapp and known for his own criticisms of the film, recognized its enduring appeal due to its contrast from more violent contemporary cinematic offerings, providing relief with its old-fashioned universality, heartwarming sentiment, and of course, memorable songs."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Fact 1: Threatening behavior causes a fight-or-flight response in animals.

I read this background article the other day: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.  I am facing a new situation today: Jessica and Milly are two politicians currently in the running for governor of their city. They are in the process of having a debate that is being broadcast on local television. Mike, an avid environmentalist who is trying to decide who to vote for, has been watching the entire debate. He feels the most important issue when voting is saving the planet and the animals on it. The question that was just asked by the moderator was \\"what do you think should be done with the Earth's atmosphere?\\" Jessica responds that she thinks we should emit more anthropogenic gases. She believes that will lead to the best outcome for the world. Milly states that we need to decrease the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which candidate will Mike not vote for?","output":"Given the background information and the new situation, Mike will most likely not vote for Jessica. The steps I took to reach this conclusion are as follows: Step 1: Understand the viewpoint and priorities of Mike. Mike is an avid environmentalist and from the scenario given, we can deduce that he considers saving the planet and the animals that inhibit it a priority.  Step 2: Evaluate Jessica's stance. Jessica replied to the question by suggesting that we should emit more anthropogenic gases, which is in disagreement with the concerns raised in the background article about the adverse effects of human-made greenhouse gases on the planet. Step 3: Evaluate Milly's stance. Milly suggested that the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere should be decreased. This aligns with the concerns in the background article about the harmful effect of these gases on the environment. Step 4: Compare both the stances with Mike's viewpoint, which is prioritising the planet and animal life. Jessica's viewpoint doesn't align with Mike's as she suggests increasing greenhouse gas emissions, which have been identified as harmful to the environment and wildlife. On the other hand, Milly's viewpoint aligns with that of Mike's. With all these considerations in mind, it is safe to say that Mike will not vote for Jessica as her stance on greenhouse gas emissions contradicts Mike's priorities."},{"instruction":"Build a movie plot around this: What does Ralph go shortly after his arrival ?

Along with the inheritance, Ralph learns that he is connected to a royal family in England and is now considered to be an honorary duke. Excited and eager to start the next chapter of his life, Ralph travels to England to claim his title and meet his newfound family. Upon his arrival, he discovers that the Royal Palace is in desperate need of repair and redecorating. The once-great castle has become dilapidated over the years due to dwindling funding. Seeing an opportunity to make a big splash and leave his mark on the palace, Ralph decides to combine his passion for classic rock and roll with his interior designing skills. He envisions a palace filled with jukeboxes, neon signs, and token memorabilia from the golden age of American music— the 1950s and 60s. Ralph's colorful and quirky ideas, however, clash with the stodgy, conservative members of the royal family, led by the ever-so-proper Queen Victoria III. They believe that the palace should be restored to its original, traditional glory and that Ralph's vision is a disgrace to the family's legacy. In spite of the resistance, Ralph inspires a group of passionate, creative outcasts from around the castle to help him on his quest to overhaul the Royal Palace. Together, they work tirelessly to transform the palace into a lively, groovy, and fun space. The once-dingy corridors are now adorned with neon lights, chrome trims, and autographed guitars from rock legends. It's a stark contrast to the conventional, stately appearance it once held. As the project progresses, the residents of the Palace, including the more traditional royals, begin to appreciate the magic and energy of Ralph's designs. The new décor sparks joy and laughter, allowing the palace to come alive with music, dance, and camaraderie. The climax of the movie is a grand party thrown in the newly redecorated ballroom, where the entire royal family, castle staff, and Ralph's friends all dance and sing together to the tunes from jukeboxes programmed by Ralph himself. The movie \\"Rockin' Royals\\" is a heartwarming and hilarious musical comedy that explores the themes of embracing change, celebrating individuality, and the power of human connections. Featuring plenty of laugh-out-loud moments and catchy musical numbers inspired by rock and roll classics, audiences will be enthralled and entertained throughout the film."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Not as a nurse, but as a patient. I had my appendix removed in about 1970 before keyhole surgery and the surgeon had not properly stitched the inside incision. This meant I was slowly “leaking” blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood. That was fine for the first five days, but the weekend came and she was off duty. Apparently, nobody else knew what to do. By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained. The nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she’d made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform. Despite the pain, I couldn’t keep myself from laughing loud and long. She then dressed the wound, directed some junior nurses to clean the ceiling and the wall while she went to clean herself.

Whether it's a minor misunderstanding or a major blunder, knowing how to say sorry in the appropriate manner is an essential skill. In French, there are numerous ways to express apologies, each with their unique nuance. This article will detail the rich vocabulary of apologies in French, enabling you to communicate your remorse effectively and with confidence. 1. Accepting Blame: \\"C'est ma faute.\\" When you're at fault and are willing to accept the responsibility for your actions, you can say \\"c'est ma faute,\\" which means \\"it's my fault\\" in English. By using this phrase, you demonstrate your willingness to own up to your mistake and make amends. 2. Excusing Yourself: \\"Excusez-moi.\\" When you need to excuse yourself from a situation or interrupt someone, you can use \\"excusez-moi,\\" which translates to \\"excuse me\\" in English. This polite expression will help you quickly communicate your desire to step back or to apologize for a brief inconvenience. 3. Pardoning Yourself: \\"Pardon.\\" If you wish to express your apology for a minor issue or wish to quickly excuse yourself without too much formality, you can say \\"pardon.\\" This versatile word means \\"sorry\\" or \\"pardon\\" in English and is suitable for informal situations. 4. Begging Pardon: \\"Je vous demande pardon.\\" For times when you need to convey deep contrition and want to formally acknowledge your mistake, you can use \\"je vous demande pardon,\\" which means \\"I beg your pardon.\\" This phrase is more formal and reflects your earnest desire to atone for your actions. 5. Stating Your Apology: \\"Je m'excuse.\\" To simply apologize for a mistake, use \\"je m'excuse,\\" which translates to \\"I apologize\\" in English. This phrase is suitable for both casual and formal situations and is commonly used in daily conversations. 6. Asking for Forgiveness: \\"Veuillez m'excuser.\\" When you need to ask for someone's forgiveness, you can say \\"veuillez m'excuser.\\" This phrase means \\"please forgive me\\" in English and is considered formal. It's appropriate to use when you genuinely seek forgiveness and want to emphasize your regret. 7. Sharing Your Regrets: \\"Regretter.\\" To express your regrets in French, use the verb \\"regretter.\\" In English, this translates to \\"to regret.\\" By using this verb, you can describe the depth of your remorse and emphasize your feelings of disappointment about a particular situation. 8. Feeling Sorry: \\"Plaindre.\\" If you wish to indicate that you feel sorry, the verb \\"plaindre\\" can be used. This word translates to \\"to feel sorry\\" or \\"to pity\\" in English. You can use this verb to show empathy and sympathy for someone else's misfortune. 9. Describing a Sorry Condition: \\"Pitoyable\\" or \\"Triste.\\" Sometimes, you may need to describe a situation or person as pitiful or sad. In French, this can be achieved using the adjectives \\"pitoyable\\" and \\"triste,\\" which mean \\"pitiful\\" and \\"sad,\\" respectively. These words are useful for describing situations that are not favorable and warrant an apology. Conclusion Effective communication often requires a good understanding of the subtle nuances of a language. When it comes to apologizing in French, being well-versed in the different ways to convey your regret and remorse will help you navigate social situations with ease and grace. Equip yourself with the vocabulary of apologies in French, and you'll be better prepared to handle any mishap with confidence and sincerity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is situated south-west of Bodmin Moor.  - Londinium was a settlement established on the current site of the City of London around  43. Its bridge over the River Thames turned the city into a road nexus and major port, serving as a major commercial centre in Roman Britain until its abandonment during the 5th century.  - A conurbation is a region comprising a number of cities, large towns, and other urban areas that, through population growth and physical expansion, have merged to form one continuous urban or industrially developed area. In most cases, a conurbation is a polycentric urbanised area, in which transportation has developed to link areas to create a single urban labour market or travel to work area.  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world.

The Isles of Scilly are an archipelago of small islands in the sea.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - Devon (archaically known as Devonshire) is a county of England, reaching from the Bristol Channel in the north to the English Channel in the south. It is part of South West England, bounded by Cornwall to the west, Somerset to the northeast, and Dorset to the east. The City of Exeter is the county town; seven other districts of East Devon, Mid Devon, North Devon, South Hams, Teignbridge, Torridge, and West Devon are under the jurisdiction of Devon County Council; Plymouth and Torbay are each a part of Devon but administered as unitary authorities.

It was established in the Anglo-Saxon system from the territory of the Middle Saxons, and existed as an official unit until 1965. The historic county included land stretching north of the River Thames from east to west of the City of London with the rivers Colne and Lea and a ridge of hills as the other boundaries. The largely low-lying county, dominated by clay in its north and alluvium on gravel in its south, was the second smallest by area in 1831.  - Cornwall is a ceremonial county and unitary authority area of England within the United Kingdom.

It is in size, and dates from the Carboniferous period of geological history. It includes Brown Willy, the highest point in Cornwall, and Rough Tor, a slightly lower peak. Many of Cornwall's rivers have their sources here. It has been inhabited since at least the Neolithic era, when primitive farmers started clearing trees and farming the land. They left their megalithic monuments, hut circles and cairns, and the Bronze Age culture that followed left further cairns, and more stone circles and stone rows. By medieval and modern times, nearly all the forest was gone and livestock rearing predominated.  - The Tamar is a river in south west England, that forms most of the border between Devon (to the east) and Cornwall (to the west). The area is a World Heritage Site due to its historic mining activities.  - The City of London is a city and county within London.

The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London, though it remains a notable part of central London. Administratively, it forms one of the 33 local authority districts of Greater London; however, the City of London is not a London borough, a status reserved for the other 32 districts (including London's only other city, the City of Westminster).   - The London Assembly is an elected body, part of the Greater London Authority, that scrutinises the activities of the Mayor of London and has the power, with a two-thirds majority, to amend the Mayor's annual budget and to reject the Mayor's draft statutory strategies. The assembly was established in 2000 and meets at City Hall on the South Bank of the River Thames, close to Tower Bridge. The assembly is also able to investigate other issues of importance to Londoners (transport, environmental matters, etc.), publish its findings and recommendations, and make proposals to the Mayor.  - The River Thames is a river that flows through southern England. At , it is the longest river entirely in England and the second longest in the United Kingdom, after the River Severn. It also flows through Oxford (where it is called Isis), Reading, Henley-on-Thames and Windsor. The lower reaches of the river are called the Tideway, derived from its long tidal reach up to Teddington Lock. It rises at Thames Head in Gloucestershire, and flows into the North Sea via the Thames Estuary. The Thames drains the whole of Greater London.   - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - A watchmaker is an artisan who makes and repairs watches. Since a majority of watches are now factory made, most modern watchmakers only repair watches. However, originally they were master craftsmen who built watches, including all their parts, by hand. Modern watchmakers, when required to repair older watches, for which replacement parts may not be available, must have fabrication skills, and can typically manufacture replacements for many of the parts found in a watch. The term clockmaker refers to an equivalent occupation specializing in clocks.  - John Arnold ( born 1736 probably in Bodmin , Cornwall -- died 1799 in London ) was an English watchmaker and inventor . John Arnold was the first to design a watch that was both practical and accurate , and also brought the term \`\` Chronometer '' into use in its modern sense , meaning a precision timekeeper . His technical advances enabled the quantity production of Marine Chronometers for use on board ships from around 1782 . The basic design of these , with a few modifications unchanged until the late twentieth century . With regard to his legacy one can say that both he and Abraham - Louis Breguet largely invented the modern mechanical watch . Certainly one of his most important inventions , the Overcoil balance spring is still to be found in most mechanical wrist watches to this day . It is necessary to point out that the brand name Arnold & Son used by a Swiss watch company has absolutely no connection to the original firm founded by John Arnold . It was from around 1770 that Arnold developed the portable precision timekeeper , almost from the point where John Harrison ended his work in this field . But compared to Harrison 's complicated and expensive watch , Arnold 's basic design was simple whilst consistently accurate and mechanically reliable . Importantly , the relatively simple and conventional design of his movement facilitated its production in quantity at a reasonable price whilst also enabling easier maintenance and adjustment . But three elements were necessary for this achievement : A detached escapement , which gave minimal interference with the vibrating balance and balance spring A balance design that enabled compensation for the effect of temperature on the balance spring A method for adjusting the balance spring , so that the balance oscillates in equal time periods , even through different degrees of balance arc  - Surrey is a county in the south east of England and also one of the home counties bordering Greater London. Surrey shares borders with Kent to the east, East Sussex to the south-east, West Sussex to the south, Hampshire to the west and south-west and Berkshire to the north-west. The county town is Guildford. Surrey County Council sits extraterritorially at Kingston upon Thames, administered as part of Greater London since 1965. With a resident population of 1.1 million, Surrey is the most densely populated and third most populated county in the South East region, after Kent and Hampshire.  - A clockmaker is an artisan who makes and/or repairs clocks. Since almost all clocks are now factory-made, most modern clockmakers only repair clocks. Modern clockmakers may be employed by jewellers, antique shops, and places devoted strictly to repairing clocks and watches. Clockmakers must be able to read blueprints and instructions for numerous types of clocks and time pieces that vary from antique clocks to modern time pieces in order to fix and make clocks or watches. The trade requires fine motor coordination as clockmakers must frequently work on devices with small gears and fine machinery.  - Redruth is a town and civil parish in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. The population of Redruth was 14,018 at the 2011 census. In the same year the population of the Camborne-Redruth urban area, which also includes Carn Brea, Illogan and several satellite villages, stood at 55,400 making it the largest conurbation in Cornwall. Redruth lies approximately at the junction of the A393 and A3047 roads, on the route of the old London to Land's End trunk road (now the A30), and is approximately west of Truro, east of St Ives, north east of Penzance and north west of Falmouth. Camborne and Redruth together form the largest urban area in Cornwall and before local government reorganisation were an urban district.  - Kent is a county in South East England and one of the home counties. It borders Greater London to the north west, Surrey to the west, East Sussex to the south west, and Essex across the Thames Estuary to the north. The county town is Maidstone.   - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.

Every year, without fail, I feel a little bit depressed on the First of March. I absolutely love summer. I love the hot weather, the skimpy clothes, the summer fruits and the party seasons. I only have good memories of summer - Christmas time, six weeks holidays when in school then three months off whilst at uni. In my eyes, there is not one bad thing about summer.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Paragraph: He repeatedly calls on his followers to embrace martyrdom since \\"The walls of oppression and humiliation cannot be demolished except in a rain of bullets.\\" For those yearning for a lost sense of order in an older, more tranquil world, he offers his \\"Caliphate\\" as an imagined alternative to today's uncertainty. For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world.  Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction.  Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith. Many Americans have wondered, \\"Why do 'they' hate us?\\" Some also ask, \\"What can we do to stop these attacks?\\"  Bin Laden and al Qaeda have given answers to both these questions.  Question: \\"Who asks What can we do to stop these attacks\\" Answer: \\"Jahiliyya\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"Answer: No, this answer is not correct. In the paragraph, it says that many Americans have wondered, \\"Why do 'they' hate us?\\" and some also ask, \\"What can we do to stop these attacks?\\" So, the correct answer is \\"some Americans\\" or \\"many Americans\\" are the ones who ask \\"What can we do to stop these attacks?\\" Jahiliyya is a term used by Qutb to describe a condition of ignorance and unbelief, not a group of people who ask questions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

With the Han Dynasty lacquered  chopsticks came, followed by gold and silver chopsticks still later. Today we have chopsticks made of plastics. The most expensive are made of part of tusks of elephants and hard green stone. Chopsticks tell Chinese tradition in their way. In ancient   times the rich used hard green stone or gold chop-sticks to show their wealth . In history many kings used silver chopsticks to take their food to see if it was poisonous . It was said that if it was, the silver chopsticks would turn colour. Chopsticks are traditionally given to a daughter when she marries to show that they should have a son very soon, for \\"Chopsticks\\" in Chinese is pronounced like \\"quick a son\\"! Tianzhu chopsticks from Hangzhou, wooden chopsticks from Shanyang of Shanxi Province, and Beijing's chopsticks are well-known. Many westerners, businessmen, tourists put aside  their knives and forks in favour  of chopsticks in China. Chopsticks appeared in the old Chinese story: an old man teaches his sons a lesson by showing how he could easily break a single chopstick but not a number of them.

Information:  - Miraculin is a natural sugar substitute , a glycoprotein extracted from the fruit of Synsepalum dulcificum . The berry , also known as the miracle fruit , was first documented by explorer Chevalier des Marchais , who searched for many different fruits during a 1725 excursion to its native West Africa . Miraculin itself is not sweet . However , after the taste buds are exposed to miraculin ( which binds to sweet receptors on the tongue ) , acidic foods which are ordinarily sour ( such as citrus ) are perceived as sweet . This effect lasts up to an hour . The active substance , isolated by Prof. Kenzo Kurihara (   Kurihara Kenz ) , a Japanese scientist , was named miraculin after the miracle fruit when Kurihara published his work in Science in 1968 .  - Reynaud Des Marchais, Chevalier des Marchais was a French cartographer and navigator who travelled extensively in the west coast of Africa, the West Indies and the northwest coast of South America between 1704 and 1727, under service to the King of France. His maps and manuscripts were published posthumously by Père J. B. Labat in Amsterdam in 1730-31.  - An oligosaccharide (from the Greek  \\"olígos\\", \\"a few\\", and  \\"sácchar\\", \\"sugar\\") is a saccharide polymer containing a small number (typically two to ten) of simple sugars (monosaccharides). Oligosaccharides can have many functions including cell recognition and cell binding. For example, glycolipids have an important role in the immune response.  - Food energy is chemical energy that animals (including humans) derive from their food and molecular oxygen through the process of cellular respiration. (Cellular respiration involves either the process of joining oxygen from air with the molecules of food (aerobic respiration) or the process of reorganizing the atoms within the molecules (anaerobic respiration).)  - West Africa, also called Western Africa and the West of Africa, is the westernmost subregion of Africa. West Africa has been defined as including 18 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, the island nation of Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, the island of Saint Helena, Senegal, Sierra Leone, São Tomé and Príncipe and Togo.  - Glycosylation (see also chemical glycosylation) is the reaction in which a carbohydrate, i.e. a glycosyl donor, is attached to a hydroxyl or other functional group of another molecule (a glycosyl acceptor). In biology glycosylation mainly refers in particular to the enzymatic process that attaches glycans to proteins, lipids, or other organic molecules. This enzymatic process produces one of the fundamental biopolymers found in cells (along with DNA, RNA, and proteins). Glycosylation is a form of co-translational and post-translational modification. Glycans serve a variety of structural and functional roles in membrane and secreted proteins. The majority of proteins synthesized in the rough ER undergo glycosylation. It is an enzyme-directed site-specific process, as opposed to the non-enzymatic chemical reaction of glycation. Glycosylation is also present in the cytoplasm and nucleus as the O-GlcNAc modification. Aglycosylation is a feature of engineered antibodies to bypass glycosylation. Five classes of glycans are produced:  - Synsepalum dulcificum is a plant known for its berry that, when eaten, causes sour foods (such as lemons and limes) subsequently consumed to taste sweet. This effect is due to miraculin. Common names for this species and its berry include miracle fruit, miracle berry, miraculous berry, sweet berry, and in West Africa, where the species originates, agbayun, taami, asaa, and ledidi.  - The lemon (\\"Citrus\\" × \\"limon\\") is a species of small evergreen tree native to Asia.  - Proteins (or ) are large biomolecules, or macromolecules, consisting of one or more long chains of amino acid residues. Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalysing metabolic reactions, DNA replication, responding to stimuli, and transporting molecules from one location to another. Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, and which usually results in protein folding into a specific three-dimensional structure that determines its activity.  - Glycoproteins are proteins that contain oligosaccharide chains (glycans) covalently attached to polypeptide side-chains. The carbohydrate is attached to the protein in a cotranslational or posttranslational modification. This process is known as glycosylation. Secreted extracellular proteins are often glycosylated.  - Taste, gustatory perception, or gustation is one of the five traditional senses that belongs to the gustatory system.  - A sugar substitute is a food additive that provides a sweet taste like that of sugar while containing significantly less food energy. Some sugar substitutes are produced by nature, and others produced synthetically. Those that are not produced by nature are, in general, called artificial sweeteners.  - Sugar is the generalized name for sweet, short-chain, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food. They are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. There are various types of sugar derived from different sources. Simple sugars are called monosaccharides and include glucose (also known as dextrose), fructose, and galactose. The table or granulated sugar most customarily used as food is sucrose, a disaccharide. (In the body, sucrose hydrolyses into fructose and glucose.) Other disaccharides include maltose and lactose. Longer chains of sugars are called oligosaccharides. Chemically-different substances may also have a sweet taste, but are not classified as sugars. Some are used as lower-calorie food substitutes for sugar, described as artificial sweeteners.  - Food additives are substances added to food to preserve flavor or enhance its taste and appearance. Some additives have been used for centuries; for example, preserving food by pickling (with vinegar), salting, as with bacon, preserving sweets or using sulfur dioxide as with wines. With the advent of processed foods in the second half of the twentieth century, many more additives have been introduced, of both natural and artificial origin.  - In biology, a common name of a taxon or organism (also known as a vernacular name, English name, colloquial name, trivial name, trivial epithet, country name, popular name, or farmer's name) is a name that is based on the normal language of everyday life; this kind of name is often contrasted with the scientific name for the same organism, which is Latinized. A common name is sometimes frequently used, but that is by no means always the case.

In 2014, the world was shocked to learn about the brutal killing of Rebecca Johnson, a young and talented healthcare professional from Australia. Working in a hospital in the Southeast Asian country, she was known for her kindness, passion, and dedication to saving lives. However, her life was cruelly cut short when she tragically became the victim of a violent crime that soon garnered international attention. The three men convicted for the heartless murder of Rebecca Johnson were sentenced to death by a judge who referred to the case as \\"one of the most heinous and cold-blooded murders\\" he had ever witnessed. While legal procedures continue in an attempt to bring justice to the fallen nurse, the possibility of clemency for the perpetrators remains a contentious issue. Peter Johnson, Rebecca's older brother, has emerged as the voice of the victim's family, articulating their unwavering stance on the matter. The Johnson family is united in their opposition to any leniency or clemency for the men responsible for their precious daughter and sister's demise. They firmly believe that forgiving and absolving the criminals would only serve to devalue not just Rebecca's life, but the lives of other potential and past victims as well. Echoing the sentiments of the bereaved loved ones, Peter Johnson asserts that it is the responsibility of the criminal justice system to ensure that its decisions reflect the gravity of such a heinous crime. As citizens who have suffered indescribable anguish, the family implores the authorities to take into consideration the impact that granting clemency would have on their unending grief, as well as on overall public safety and social order. The family's adamant opposition to clemency stems not from a desire for vengeance, but from the hope that by refusing leniency, they can contribute to deterring similar acts of violence in the future. Such a cruel and wanton taking of an innocent life ought to be met with the full weight of the law, they believe, to send a clear and unequivocal message that society will not tolerate such abhorrent acts. While the family mourns the loss of their daughter, sister, and friend, they remain steadfast in their convictions, understanding that nothing can bring Rebecca back. They also acknowledge the magnitude of this issue, especially the contentious debate surrounding the death penalty. However, their ultimate priority remains ensuring that their beloved family member's memory is honored, and her senseless death is not without consequence nor meaning. In the face of this tragic ordeal, the Johnson family's courageous stand against clemency for the individuals responsible for Rebecca's murder serves as a powerful reminder of the value that societies place on justice, accountability, and the inherent worth of human life. As the legal process unfolds, it is crucial that the voices of victims' families, such as the Johnson, are heard and considered, ensuring that the criminal justice system strives to uphold the principles of fairness, compassion, and respect to all those affected by violent crime."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: How does Carol decide they should take their own lives? Title: Testament Movie plot: The Wetherly familyâhusband Tom (William Devane), wife Carol (Jane Alexander), and children Brad (Ross Harris), Mary Liz (Roxana Zal), and Scottie (Lukas Haas) -- live in the fictional suburb of Hamelin, California, within a 90-minute drive of San Francisco, where Tom works. On a routine afternoon, Carol (a stay-at-home mom and volunteer for school functions such as directing the school play) listens to an answering-machine message from Tom saying he's on his way home for dinner. Scottie watches Sesame Street on TV as Brad adjusts the TV antenna on the roof, when the show is suddenly replaced by white noise; suddenly, a San Francisco news anchor appears onscreen, saying they have lost their New York signal and there were explosions of \\"nuclear devices there in New York, and up and down the East Coast.\\" The anchorman is cut off by the Emergency Broadcast System tone with the Civil Defense Insignia being shown on the Screen, then an announcer's voice states that the White House is interrupting the program: \\"Please stand by for the President and do not use the telephone.\\" At the introduction of the President of the United States (who is never seen; only the Presidential Seal is shown on the TV), the phone rings but it goes dead along with the TV and electricity just as Carol answers it.

News article: South Africa's Wits Art Museum to Open in Johannesburg 'Totem Figure,' a 1973 wood panel by Johannesburg's Cecil Skotnes, will be on view at the Wits Art Museum. A former gas station, car dealership and dental school building are helping to transform central Johannesburg from a hotbed of crime to a hub for art. The repurposed buildings make up the Wits Art Museum, which opens Saturday as a showcase for African art. Built on the edge of the University of the Witwatersrand's campus in the South African city's bohemian Braamfontein district, the new museum has soaring glass windows and an open-air entry way. Along with Cape Town, with its South African National Gallery, and Harare, with the National Gallery of Zimbabwe, South Africa's commercial capital has had a longtime art-world presence. Its contemporary galleries are well regarded, and another museum in the city center—the Johannesburg Art Gallery, which opened in 1915—has a fine collection of modern South African artwork and lesser pieces by European masters, including Pablo Picasso and Claude Monet. The 5.4 million Wits project created 54,000 square feet of exhibition and teaching space—still modest compared with the two million square feet of New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. The work was funded by the university and donors led by South Africa's Standard Bank Group Ltd., which contributed half the artworks. The gallery forecourt of the Wits Art Museum in Johannesburg. The museum bridges the traditional and modern. An initial installation by the South African visual artist Gavin Olivier uses tracking cameras, even at night, to project images onto the museum's front windows that react to the shape and movements of people within their range. \\"We want to engage people who come by when the gallery is closed, who are on the wrong side of the glass,\\" Mr. Olivier said. The museum will display rotating highlights from the university's 10,000-piece collection of African art, stretching from 16th-century Congolese pottery to contemporary works by William Kentridge, South Africa's most famous working artist and a Wits graduate. Many of the paintings reflect the political and cultural upheaval of South Africa's recent past. \\"Baggage,\\" by the Cape Town-based artist Randy Hartzenberg, is an abstract portrayal of the white-minority government's campaigns in the 1970s to force black, mixed-race and ethnically Indian South Africans into separate townships. Willem Boshoff's \\"The Purple Shall Govern\\" reproduces the lyrics from 49 anti-apartheid songs and slogans in Zulu and other indigenous languages across three large panels. English translation runs under each line in much smaller script. “Works include 16th-century Congolese pottery and paintings evoking apartheid. ” On a nearby wall hangs \\"Totem Figure,\\" a facial relief carved in wood and painted by Cecil Skotnes, who in the 1950s and 1960s presided over a Johannesburg artists' salon called Polly Street that became a training ground for many of South Africa's most influential painters and sculptors. Sculptures and cultural artifacts in the same room hark back to more traditional African forms—even as they reflect the continent's encounter with Europe as well. Carved wooden figurines from Ivory Coast and elsewhere in West Africa portray soldiers and policemen in colonial uniforms and pith helmets and even a Victorian lady, possibly a missionary's wife. \\"African art is often treated as coming from before the colonial past,\\" said senior curator Julia Charlton. \\"But this artwork reflects all those cross-references and influences.

A: Answer:","output":"Adult herbivores in a herd surround their young primarily to provide protection for the vulnerable offspring. Living in a group offers several advantages such as increased vigilance and defense against predators, as well as social interaction and support. By surrounding the young, adult herbivores create a physical barrier that makes it more difficult for predators to attack the weaker and less experienced members of the herd.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Can you tell me the answer to a corporation gives out its profits as dividends paid to whom??","output":"A corporation distributes its profits as dividends to its shareholders. The term 'shareholder' refers to anyone who owns one or more shares in a company. These shareholders have a vested interest in the company's performance as they stand to gain or lose money based on the corporation's success or failure. They are the legal owners of the company and have invested their money into buying stocks with the hope of experiencing a return on their investment. Shares in a company represent ownership stake. When a person or an entity buys a share of stock in a company, that person or entity becomes a shareholder and thus a part-owner of that company. This ownership stake entitles them to a proportionate share of the company's profits, among other rights. The process of distributing dividends usually follows this sequence: 1. Earnings and Profits Calculation: The corporation will first determine its earnings and profits for a given financial period. 2. Board of Directors' Decision: The corporation's board of directors will then make a decision on whether to distribute these profits to shareholders and if so, how much should be distributed. This decision typically depends on a variety of factors, including the company's financial health, reinvestment needs, business plans, debt obligations, and more. 3. Announcement: Once a decision is made, the corporation will announce a dividend payout. This announcement will include information about the amount to be paid per share, the date of record (The date which determines who is entitled to receive the dividend), and the payment date.  4. Dividend Distribution: On the payment date, the corporation will distribute dividends to shareholders who are registered as the owners of the corporation's stock on the record date.  The actual amount that a shareholder receives as dividends depends on the number of shares they own. If a company declares a 1 dividend and a shareholder owns 100 shares, that shareholder would receive 100. These dividends can be in the form of cash, additional shares of stock also known as stock dividends, or other property. Cash dividends are the most common, and shareholders typically need to pay taxes on the dividends they receive. It's significant to remember that not all corporations pay dividends to their shareholders. Sometimes, companies may choose to reinvest their profits back into the business in what we term retained earnings for potential growth and expansion or to fund their ongoing business operations, instead of distributing them as dividends.

Laika is memorialised in the form of a statue and plaque at Star City, Russia, the Russian Cosmonaut training facility. Created in 1997, Laika is positioned behind the cosmonauts with her ears erect. The Monument to the Conquerors of Space, constructed in 1964, also includes Laika. On 11 April 2008  at the military research facility where staff had been responsible for readying Laika for the flight, officials unveiled a monument of her poised on top of a space rocket. Stamps and envelopes picturing Laika were produced, as well as branded cigarettes and matches.Future space missions carrying dogs would be designed to be recovered. Four other dogs died in Soviet space missions: Bars and Lisichka were killed when their R-7 rocket exploded shortly after launch on 28 July 1960; Pchyolka and Mushka died when Korabl-Sputnik 3 was purposely destroyed with an explosive charge to prevent foreign powers from inspecting the capsule after a wayward atmospheric reentry trajectory on 1 December 1960.Although never shown, Laika is prominently mentioned in the 1985 film My Life as a Dog, in which the main character (a young Swedish boy in the late 1950s) identifies strongly with the dog. Laika, a 2007 graphic novel by Nick Abadzis giving a fictionalized account of Laika's life, won the Eisner Award for Best Publication for Teens.

Write an article with the title: \\"Pakistan’s ‘answer to Glee’ will address homosexuality and extremism - in song, of course\\"","output":"Title: Pakistan’s ‘Answer to Glee’ Will Address Homosexuality and Extremism - In Song, of Course Introduction In a society where certain subjects are considered taboo, it takes immense courage to address them. However, when it comes to telling stories that have the power to change minds and hearts, what better format than a song? In a groundbreaking move, a group of bold creators has come together to produce Pakistan's answer to 'Glee,' the famed American television series. This pioneering show will use songs to tackle topics like homosexuality and extremism, which are typically brushed under the carpet in the country. A Glimpse into the Show Taking inspiration from 'Glee,' a musical drama series that ran from 2009 to 2015, the Pakistani version promises to incorporate powerful performances and original songs. The storyline revolves around a group of talented but misunderstood misfits who come together to form a musical ensemble. Through triumphs and tribulations, the characters explore the complexities of sexuality, societal injustice, and radicalism in modern-day Pakistan. The creators of the Pakistani series have designed the show to speak to today's youth. By utilizing song and dance, young talents showcase their unique abilities, stimulating discussions and highlighting themes that might seem controversial. Hence, music becomes the primary vehicle in which the show drives crucial conversations while entertaining its viewers. Addressing Homosexuality The creators of the Pakistani 'Glee' wish to bring forth conversations surrounding homosexuality, a topic considered tabooin the South Asian country. By incorporating various LGBTQIA+ characters, the show aims at dismantling misconceptions and fostering empathy. The television series will share stories of acceptance, love, and self-discovery, presenting a fresh perspective on the LGBTQIA+ community's struggles in a predominantly conservative environment. Through the portrayal of numerous homosexual characters and their journeys, the show seeks to educate the masses on the unique challenges faced by the community in Pakistan. By addressing these issues through art, Pakistan's 'Glee' aims to create a safe space for viewers to discover and discuss these sensitive topics, building bridges of understanding and compassion. Tackling Extremism Apart from addressing homosexuality, the Pakistani 'Glee' will dive into the subject of extremism. The show will depict characters' struggles against radical ideologies that often result in violence and hatred. Music and drama will be used to challenge these extremist beliefs, promoting principles of unity, love, tolerance, and peace. This approach comes at a vital time, as the nation strives to reduce the prevalence of extremist perspectives. The storyline will offer alternative ways for young people to express their emotions and frustrations, spotlighting the potential for music and art to heal and transform. By presenting instances where characters confront and challenge these radical ideas, the series hopes to inspire a sense of responsibility within the viewers, particularly the youth. Expectations and Impact Given the controversial nature of the themes being addressed, it is no surprise that the creators of the Pakistani 'Glee' are preparing for potential backlash. However, they remain focused on their mission to generate conversations, dismantle prejudices, and create opportunities for dialogues around these themes. The success of the American 'Glee,' which championed important conversations surrounding sexuality, identity, and mental health, raises hopes for the Pakistani counterpart. With its fresh storyline and powerful performances, the show has the potential to make a lasting impact on the Pakistani television landscape. In conclusion, the bold approach taken by the creators of Pakistan’s answer to 'Glee' is a testament to their dedication to addressing sensitive topics through the medium of art. By using song and dance as vehicles for change, the series aims to build bridges, foster empathy, and challenge discrimination, steering the country towards a brighter future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Inzamam-ul-Haq ( pronunciation ;Punjabi, Urdu: nDmm lHq; born 3 March 1970), also known as Inzy, is a former Pakistani cricketer, and former captain. He is the leading run scorer for Pakistan in one-day internationals, and the third-highest run scorer for Pakistan in Test cricket. He was the captain of the Pakistan national cricket team from 2003-07 and is considered to be one of the best leaders in Pakistan Cricket history. Inzamam rose to fame in the semi-final of the 1992 Cricket World Cup. Inzamam made his (ODI) debut in a home series against West Indies in 1991, and made a good start to his career by scoring 20 and 60 runs in two matches against West Indies. This was followed by 48, 60, 101, and 117 runs against Sri Lanka.  Handpicked by former Pakistan captain Imran Khan for the 1992 Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, 22-year-old Inzamam was relatively unheard of before the tournament. To the surprise of many he was persevered with throughout the tournament, coming in at various positions in the batting line-up, despite not being very successful early on. Yet it was his performances at the most crucial stage of the competition that made fans and summarisers take note. Inzamam rose to fame in Pakistan's dramatic semi-final against New Zealand at Auckland. With his side in a precarious position, chasing 262 against an impressive New Zealand side, he hit a fiery 60 run innings from just 37 balls to rescue his side and guide them into the final. The innings was regarded as one of the finest World Cup performances. He hit a massive six in that match which was described by David Lloyd as the shot of the tournament.  Inzamam made an equally vital contribution in the final of the World Cup, scoring 42 runs off just 35 balls, helping Pakistan reach a score of 249 after a sluggish start. These innings established Inzamam's billing as a big-game player, although he was unable to replicate his World Cup success in later tournaments.  Inzamam regard his best least highlighted innings of 90 not out against West Indies when Pakistan won their first ODI in the West Indies on 27 March 1993.  In total, Inzamam set a record for scoring the most half centuries in One Day Internationals, 83 - though this is now surpassed by Sachin Tendulkar, Jacques Kallis and Kumar Sangakkara. He also became the second batsman to score 10,000 runs in One-day Internationals (again after Tendulkar) and was named in the ICC World XI for both Tests and One-day Internationals in the 2005 ICC Awards. In his final ODI for Pakistan, playing against Zimbabwe in the 2007 Cricket World Cup, he took three catches whilst fielding, including the last one of the match, ending his One Day career.","output":"This text is about Inzamam-ul-Haq, also known as Inzy, a former Pakistani cricketer and former captain of the Pakistan national cricket team.

By Ed Kilgore      Buried near the end of a soft-focus Mark Liebovitch piece on a visit with Ann and Mitt Romney, mainly preoccupied with determining whether the Mittster is serious about running again, is this fascinating snippet:      “I was talking to one of my political advisers,” Romney continued, “and I said: ‘If I had to do this again, I’d insist that you literally had a camera on me at all times” — essentially employing his own tracker, as opposition researchers call them. “I want to be reminded that this is not off the cuff.” This, as he saw it, was what got him in trouble at that Boca Raton fund-raiser, when Romney told the crowd he was writing off the 47 percent of the electorate that supported Obama (a.k.a. “those people”; “victims” who take no “personal responsibility”). Romney told me that the statement came out wrong, because it was an attempt to placate a rambling supporter who was saying that Obama voters were essentially deadbeats.      “My mistake was that I was speaking in a way that reflected back to the man,” Romney said. “If I had been able to see the camera, I would have remembered that I was talking to the whole world, not just the man.” I had never heard Romney say that he was prompted into the “47 percent” line by a ranting supporter. It was also impossible to ignore the phrase “If I had to do this again.”      Liebovitch was interested in the “on-the-record-all-the-time” idea as a reflection of Romney’s “limitations as a candidate.” But I’d say it captures the central nature of Romney’s entire 2012 campaign. Throughout the primaries he was always in effect talking to some angry if not entirely coherent Republican voter or donor or media opinion-leader, and trying to “reflect back” to their POV, which Mitt did not entirely share but had to take very, very seriously. It’s an almost impossible habit to break, and at a crucial moment, he couldn’t. ||||| Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin) who was the GOP vice presidential nominee in 2012 reflected on one of the more controversial moments of that race in an interview with Charlie Rose that aired on PBS Monday evening. During the discussion, Rose asked Ryan about a video that emerged showing Romney telling donors 47 percent of Americans would vote for President Barack Obama \\"no matter what\\" because they are \\"dependent on government.\\"      Ryan responded that what Romney said \\"was wrong.\\" He went on to describe it as an ineffective way to articulate their economic policies.      \\"What we are trying to communicate is we want to have a system so that everybody can get to where they want to get in life,\\" Ryan explained.      Ryan remains a vocal supporter of Romney's and discussed this in his interview with Rose. He addressed mounting speculation Romney could mount a third White House bid in 2016 and implied he would gladly be Romney's running mate once again.      \\"I'll be his bus driver if he wants me to be. Look, I think he'd be a great president,\\" said Ryan.      He addressed the infamous \\"47 percent: video, which was widely seen as pivotal in the last election, during a larger discussion of what Ryan described as \\"mistakes\\" he believes he and other conservatives have made when discussing poverty.      Rather than criticizing those who are \\"dependent\\" on government, Ryan argued conservatives need to clearly articulate support for \\"bottom-up pro-growth policies\\" to combat poverty that are focused on local community organizations. He contrasted this with what he described as the \\"governing philosophy that's prevailing in Washington right now,\\" which is focused on social welfare programs run by the government.      Ryan, who recently wrote a book outlining his ideas to combat poverty also discussed the possibility he could run for president in 2016. He said he would make a decision \\"in the spring of 2015.\\" Ryan described the main questions he would evaluate in making his choice.      \\"Family, is there somebody else that I would like and I can back,\\" Ryan said. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"In a recent interview, Mitt Romney reflected on his 2012 presidential campaign, noting that if he had to do it again, he would want a camera on him at all times to help him stay aware of the broader audience.

People's lives have changed.\\"      Nieves-Cruiz said she still was in mourning but looking forward.      \\"Mourn, but at the same time keep living,\\" she said. \\"I'm pretty sure that everyone who lost their lives and everybody that's healing in the hospital would want us to. After all, they were out celebrating life.\\"      Mayor Buddy Dyer marveled at the size of the crowd, which packed the park from the water's edge all the way back into the streets on every side.      \\"Wow, Orlando,\\" Dyer told the throng. \\"You're showing your love, your compassion, your unity.\\"      Orange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs offered a message of hope and a rallying cry for support for the LGBT community.      \\"We shared a sorrow this past week that was so profound that at times it felt like healing would be impossible,\\" Jacobs said. \\"Every person that was lost was the fabric of our community. Each person's life was a beautiful story — a story that was so cruelly and abruptly ended. Each had dreams waiting to come true. Each had aspirations left unfulfilled … To our LGBTQ community, I tell you today that you are not alone. You are not alone in your sorrow and you are not alone in this fight.\\"      Standing near the edge of the water with a good look at the stage, DeLand residents Steve Rader and Jason Gulley saw the Lake Eola vigil as a turning point.      \\"I think that it is time that we start shifting gears … continue to remember, but hopefully this is the exclamation point of our sadness, and we can move on,\\" Rader said. The couple will be wed in September, he said.      They created bright, rainbow-inspired T-shirts to wear to the vigil. Along with the new Orlando United and Orlando Strong shirts, others wore T-shirts and signs with slogans such as \\"No hate in our state,\\" \\"Disarm hate,\\" \\"One Pulse,\\" \\"Love is always right\\" and \\"We shall overcome.\\"      Thousands turned out for the vigil at Lake Eola on Sunday night for the victims on the Pulse nightclub shootings.      The atmosphere before the ceremony was low key, with people giving away flowers and water, getting their faces painted and carrying flags. A giant rainbow flag toted by about 40 people provided levity as it was held aloft for others to run beneath.      Prior to the vigil, nearby Cathedral Church of St. Luke held a service offering prayers for healing and hope.      \\"Today I'm wholly inadequate to share any words that would heal this. … This week we have felt forsaken,\\" City Commissioner Robert Stuart said at the service.      He later added that the Bible promises that \\"even those yet unborn will know God.\\" He said his prayer is that future generations will look back at the Pulse shooting and say, \\"This is that moment in time in which we decided to make our community better.\\"      To close out the service, the name and age of each victim was read aloud, followed by the tolling of the church bell after each name.      As the names were read, those on hand sat in somber silence. Many bowed their heads, lifting them only to wipe away tears.      \\"To love takes courage,\\" the Rev. Reggie Kidd said. \\"May the lives of those who have been take from us be honored here.\\"      He called for people \\"to stand in solidarity with LGBT, Latino and Latina members of our community.      \\"We wish to offer consolation to those who have lost loved ones, comfort to survivors and encouragement and strength to first responders and caregivers.\\"      After the service, many attending walked the short distance to Lake Eola Park for the vigil.      Irene Lynn and her husband, Rod, arrived at 4 p.m. at Lake Eola, along with their daughter Kristen and her fiancée Delilah Rodriguez. The women plan to get married next year.      \\"I think this is more than gay rights,\\" Irene Lynn said. \\"I think there is more love out there than we think there is.\\"      Rod Lynn said he has hope for change.      \\"Many times it takes a catalyst like this to initiate a more progressive type movement,\\" he said. \\"No one deserves what happened. This kind of thing needs to stop.\\"      But the grieving process is not over, Irene Lynn said.      \\"This is the beginning of the beginning,\\" she said.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: The most successful athletes are defined by their ability to accommodate for a wide range of techniques. In a competitive environment, you can't depend on the other team to use one kind of shot. If you feel like you've mastered certain blocks but other players are still getting shots past you, it is likely you haven't taken all possible shots into account yet. Here are some common shots to look out for:  A jump shot is the most common shot. To gain height, offensive players will jump in the air and throw the ball towards the net. A slam dunk is the most efficient shot in basketball. This is where an offensive player runs directly up the court, jumps up, and delivers it directly into the net. A fadeaway is an advanced shot where the offensive player will lean away from the net as he throws it in. This is done to avert the efforts of blocking players. It can be resisted by putting your arms in the predicted path of the basketball. A faked shot is where an offensive player lines up a shot but doesn't actually throw the ball. This is done for psychological reasons of tricking up the opposing team. Slam dunks are considered very risky shots, as it's difficult to get a proper block without incurring a foul call. If you do attempt to block a slam dunk, get in between the net and the other player and jump directly up, aiming your hand in the path of the ball. A fadeaway shot is where a shooting player will hop backwards as he throws the ball towards the hoop. This tactic is specifically geared to trick up a blocking player. To maximize your chances of blocking a fadeaway, jump up between the ball and the net and extend your hands towards the ball. Don't swing your arms unnecessarily around as you're blocking. This will incur a foul call. A significant part of blocking shots in basketball involves the proper use of jumping. Jumping is a muscle-based exercise, but it's not often seen as a primary workout focus for many players. Practice doing sets of vertical jumps, attempting to get as much force off the ground as you can. Next, add on to this exercise by holding barbells in each hand and jumping with them. This will increase the pressure on your legs, making them better-suited for jumping blocks when you play competitively. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article is about how to be a good athlete in basketball by learning different ways to block shots from other players. The article talks about common shots like jump shots, slam dunks, fadeaways, and faked shots. It also gives tips on how to block these shots and how practicing jumping can make you better at blocking shots when playing basketball."},{"instruction":"The frenetic lifestyle that many people live today is very harmful. Rushing here and there, being constantly on call, balancing multiple layers of responsibility may give you a sense of accomplishment – even make you feel important, but it takes a huge toll on every aspect of life. When you constantly push yourself to take on more and more challenges, it is easy to lose sight of why you wanted to be successful in the first place. For many, the reason was to be able to spend less time working and enjoy life more.  A frenetic, high-pressure lifestyle creates exactly the opposite. There is a very dark side to constantly pushing yourself to produce more and more. Unfortunately, it creeps up on you and becomes a serious case of self-negligence. When you are busy and driven every minute of every day and well into the evening, it is easy to neglect important things in life that keep you healthy, happy, and create quality of life.  A continual stream of urgent tasks that must be completed will overshadow the not-so-urgent, but important activities that make life worth living. It is not just physical well-being that is neglected – mental and emotional well-being also suffer when there is no time for self-care.

On 14 January 1978, during the tour's final date at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, a disillusioned Rotten introduced the band's encore saying, \\"You'll get one number and one number only 'cause I'm a lazy bastard.\\" That one number was a Stooges cover, \\"No Fun\\". At the end of the song, Rotten, kneeling on the stage, chanted an unambiguous declaration, \\"This is no fun. No fun. This is no fun—at all. No fun.\\" As the final cymbal crash died away, Rotten addressed the audience directly—\\"Ah-ha-ha. Ever get the feeling you've been cheated? Good night\\"—before throwing down his microphone and walking offstage. He later observed, \\"I felt cheated, and I wasn't going on with it any longer; it was a ridiculous farce. Sid was completely out of his brains—just a waste of space. The whole thing was a joke at that point.... [Malcolm] wouldn't speak to me.... He would not discuss anything with me. But then he would turn around and tell Paul and Steve that the tension was all my fault because I wouldn't agree to anything.\\"On 17 January, the band split, making their ways separately to Los Angeles. McLaren, Cook and Jones prepared to fly to Rio de Janeiro for a working vacation.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person whose team locates a living heir? , can you please find it?   When the entire British royal family is killed in a freak accident outside Buckingham Palace, Sir Cedric Willingham leads a search for any surviving heirs to whom to pass the crown. After days of researching, his team finally locates a living heir in the form of an American named Ralph Jones. Shortly after being fired from his job as a lounge singer in Las Vegas, Ralph is informed by Cedric's assistant private secretary Duncan Phipps that his grandmother Constance had an affair with the first Duke of Warren while working as a hotel waitress when the Duke was visiting the United States, resulting in Ralph having royal blood. Phipps provides further proof by showing Ralph a duplicate of the ring his grandmother used to wear that the Duke had given her. Ralph is flown to London, where Cedric gives him a crash course on royal etiquette. In only his second day as King, he goes to a strip club and meets Miranda Greene, an out-of-luck exotic dancer and aspiring fashion designer, and dares her to go out on a date with him if the British press proves his claim to the monarchy. Meanwhile, Lord Percival Graves is opposed to having an American on the throne and proposes to declare the reigning House of Wyndham at an end and replace it with the House of Stuart, of which he is patriarch. Prime Minister Geoffrey Hale states that Ralph's succession is legitimate unless he commits a grievous error. With this in mind, Graves bribes a cash-strapped Miranda to stir up controversy by having a public relationship with Ralph. Despite warnings by Cedric not to commit a mistake similar to that of King Edward VIII, Ralph sneaks out of the Palace to have a romantic date with Miranda at Hyde Park. The next day, Miranda returns the money to Graves, but he already has photographs of her with Ralph. In order to preserve Ralph's reputation, Miranda breaks up with him.

Tak'alik Ab'aj (; Mayan pronunciation: [takˀaˈlik aˀ'ɓaχ] (listen); Spanish: [takaˈlik aˈβax]) is a pre-Columbian archaeological site in Guatemala. It was formerly known as Abaj Takalik; its ancient name may have been Kooja. It is one of several Mesoamerican sites with both Olmec and Maya features. The site flourished in the Preclassic and Classic periods, from the 9th century BC through to at least the 10th century AD, and was an important centre of commerce, trading with Kaminaljuyu and Chocolá. Investigations have revealed that it is one of the largest sites with sculptured monuments on the Pacific coastal plain. Olmec-style sculptures include a possible colossal head, petroglyphs and others. The site has one of the greatest concentrations of Olmec-style sculpture outside of the Gulf of Mexico.Takalik Abaj is representative of the first blossoming of Maya culture that had occurred by about 400 BC. The site includes a Maya royal tomb and examples of Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions that are among the earliest from the Maya region. Excavation is continuing at the site; the monumental architecture and persistent tradition of sculpture in a variety of styles suggest the site was of some importance.Finds from the site indicate contact with the distant metropolis of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico and imply that Takalik Abaj was conquered by it or its allies. Takalik Abaj was linked to long-distance Maya trade routes that shifted over time but allowed the city to participate in a trade network that included the Guatemalan highlands and the Pacific coastal plain from Mexico to El Salvador. Takalik Abaj was a sizeable city with the principal architecture clustered into four main groups spread across nine terraces. While some of these were natural features, others were artificial constructions requiring an enormous investment in labour and materials. The site featured a sophisticated water drainage system and a wealth of sculptured monuments.","output":"The modern name of Kooja, as stated in the article, is Tak'alik Ab'aj.

The site of Tak'alik Ab'aj not only carries historic value but also serves as an archaeological testament to the first flourishing of the Maya culture, which is presumed to have happened by around 400 BC. A Maya royal tomb and some of the earliest examples of Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions are found here. Investigation is ongoing and the remarkable architectural monuments and persistent tradition of sculpture in various styles suggest the site held significant importance. Artifacts found on site also suggest that Tak'alik Ab'aj had contact with the distant city of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico and might have been conquered by it or its allies. The city had a system to participate in long-distance Maya trade routes, which, despite shifting over time, strongly connected this metropolis to a trade network that included the Guatemalan highlands and the Pacific coastal plain from Mexico to El Salvador. Structurally, Tak'alik Ab'aj is a large city with four main groups of architectures spread across nine terraces. Some of these terraces are natural features while others are artificial constructions that would have required considerable investment in labor and materials. The site also featured a sophisticated water drainage system and a multitude of sculptured monuments, further underlining the cultural and historical significance of the city now known as Tak'alik Ab'aj, but possibly once called Kooja."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: Osceola was named Billy Powell at birth in 1804 in the Creek village of Talisi. now known as Tallassee, Alabama, in current Elmore County. \\"The people in the town of Tallassee...were mixed-blood Native American/English/Irish/Scottish, and some were black. Billy was all of these.\\" Context: Through the 1820s and the turn of the decade, American settlers kept up pressure on the US government to remove the Seminole from Florida to make way for their desired agricultural development. In 1832, a few Seminole chiefs signed the Treaty of Payne's Landing, by which they agreed to give up their Florida lands in exchange for lands west of the Mississippi River in Indian Territory. According to legend, Osceola stabbed the treaty with his knife, although there are no contemporary reports of this.  Five of the most important Seminole chiefs, including Micanopy of the Alachua Seminole, did not agree to removal. In retaliation, the US Indian agent, Wiley Thompson, declared that those chiefs were deposed from their positions. As US relations with the Seminole deteriorated, Thompson forbade the sale of guns and ammunition to them. Osceola, a young warrior rising to prominence, resented this ban. He felt it equated the Seminole with slaves, who were forbidden to carry arms.  Thompson considered Osceola to be a friend and gave him a rifle. Osceola had a habit of barging into Thompson's office and shouting complaints at him. On one occasion Osceola quarreled with Thompson who had the warrior locked up at Fort King for a two nights until he agreed to be more respectful. In order to secure his release, Osceola agreed to sign the Treaty of Payne's Landing and to bring his followers into the fort. After his humiliating imprisonment, Osceola secretly prepared vengeance against Thompson.  On December 28, 1835, Osceola, with the same rifle Thompson gave him, killed Wiley Thompson. Osceola and his followers shot six others outside Fort King, while another group of Seminole ambushed and killed a column of US Army, over 100 troops, marching from Fort Brooke to Fort King, in what Americans called the Dade Massacre. These nearly simultaneous attacks began the Second Seminole War. Question: What attacks caused it? Answer:","output":"The attacks that caused the Second Seminole War were the killing of US Indian agent Wiley Thompson and six others by Osceola and his followers outside Fort King, and the ambush and killing of over 100 US Army troops marching from Fort Brooke to Fort King, in an event known as the Dade Massacre. These nearly simultaneous attacks led to the escalation of hostilities between the Seminole people and the United States government, marking the beginning of the Second Seminole War."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Experts said it was partially a result of buy-to-let landlords looking to beat April's tax changes. When the new tax year starts, most landlords will pay a 3% surcharge on stamp duty on property purchases. In addition the CML said real wage growth, falling unemployment and competitive mortgage deals were all stimulating borrowing. \\"Lending started the year on a positive note,\\" said CML economist Mohammad Jamei. However, he said the outlook for later in the year was not so good. \\"We still only see limited upside potential going forwards, as the number of properties for sale on the market remains low and affordability pressures weigh on activity,\\" he said. Summary:","output":"The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) reported a 21% increase in mortgage lending in January 2016 compared to January 2014. This rise is attributed to various factors, including buy-to-let landlords trying to avoid the new tax changes in April, which will introduce a 3% surcharge on stamp duty for property purchases. Furthermore, real wage growth, falling unemployment, and competitive mortgage deals have all played a role in stimulating borrowing. CML economist, Mohammad Jamei, stated that although lending began the year on a positive note, the outlook for the rest of the year might not be as promising, due to the limited number of properties on the market and the affordability pressures affecting the activity."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The research team have discovered that subordinate  fish voluntarily diet to avoid challenging their larger competitors.\\"In studying gobies we noticed that only the largest two individuals,a male and female,had breeding rights within the group,\\" explains Marian Wong.\\"All other group members are nonbreeding females,each being 5-10% smaller than its next largest competitor.We wanted to find out how they maintain this precise size separation.\\" The reason for the size difference was easy to see.Once a subordinate fish grows to within 5-10% of the size of its larger competitor,it causes a fight which usually ends in the smaller goby being driven away from the group.More often than not, _ is then eaten up. It appeared that the smaller fish were keeping themselves small in order to avoid challenging the boss fish.Whether they did so voluntarily,by restraining how much they ate,was not clear.The research team decided to do an experiment.They tried to fatten up some of the subordinate gobies to see what happened.To their surprise,the gobies simply refused the extra food they were offered,clearly preferring to remain small and avoid fights,over having a feast. The discovery challenges the traditional scientific view of how boss individuals keep their position in a group.Previously it was thought that large individuals simply used their weight and size to threaten their subordinates and take more of the food for themselves,so keeping their competitors small. While the habits of gobies may seem a little mysterious,Dr.Wong explains that understanding the relationships between boss and subordinate animals is important to understand how hierarchical societies remain stable. The research has proved the fact that voluntary dieting is a habit far from exclusive to humans.\\"As yet,we...

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. This article: Philip Arnold Heseltine (30 October 1894 – 17 December 1930), known by the pseudonym Peter Warlock, was a British composer and music critic. The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle. As a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic.  During 1920–21 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent. Through his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand. contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who turned to musical journalism after a failed student career in Oxford and London?, what is it ?

Question: what is considered the ultimate expression of compassion? Context: Traditionally, the first step in most Buddhist schools requires taking refuge in the Three Jewels (Sanskrit: tri-ratna, Pāli: ti-ratana)[web 19] as the foundation of one's religious practice. The practice of taking refuge on behalf of young or even unborn children is mentioned in the Majjhima Nikaya, recognized by most scholars as an early text (cf. Infant baptism). Tibetan Buddhism sometimes adds a fourth refuge, in the lama. In Mahayana, the person who chooses the bodhisattva path makes a vow or pledge, considered the ultimate expression of compassion. In Mahayana, too, the Three Jewels are perceived as possessed of an eternal and unchanging essence and as having an irreversible effect: \\"The Three Jewels have the quality of excellence.

One day, as a result of the suspension of a research project dealing with a dynamically mutating vaccine following the pattern of the eyesocket flu bacillus, they had absolutely nothing to do until the end of the day, because the boss didn't order them to wash test-tubes. They decided to play a game of hockey under the microscope. For a puck they used one of the millions of experimental bacillus, and one-arm pincettes, which as it happened also resembled hockey sticks, served as sticks. The bacillus was not happy with it at all. It wanted to rest after an exhausting task involving vaccine discouragement, and these whitecoats here planned to put it to work yet again. And this time the work was much more labor-intensive and even more exhausting than before, but the condition and health of the tired bacillus not as good as in the times of youth, about two hours ago. The scientists got excited. On a microscope slide they etched a hockey rink with laser, agreed on the rules, connected the microscope's camera to the big screen display and played until the morning. They had to change pucks several times, but that was fine, they had millions of them in stock. The next day they didn't have anything to do either and they continued to play. They even invited other colleagues and the popularity of the game was so huge they could afford to play it in a championship system. Soon, the games were joined by the guys from the car-repair garage next door.

News anchor Barry Baron discovers that a drug smuggling ring is operating out of the building where he works, and is chased down and eventually shot dead by the drug dealers. His co-anchor, Dulcie Niles finds Barry's body, calls the police and prepares to film the investigation, but before the police can arrive Barry's body is stolen by the building's cleaner, Chafuka, who uses her voodoo powers to reanimate Barry's corpse as a zombie, allowing her to take over Barry's luxury apartment. In order to keep up appearances, Chafuka has Barry, who is otherwise unable to speak, continue performing his news broadcasts by controlling him with a voodoo doll, while Dulcie continues to investigate the drug ring with the help of incompetent police detective Jordan Penrose. Meanwhile, the head of the drug ring, Nolan sees one of Barry's news broadcasts and assumes that his henchmen bungled Barry's murder, and sends them to finish the job off. When they arrive at the station however, they end up being killed in a series of mishaps, and Chafuka turns them into more zombies. On seeing his zombified former henchmen, Nolan panics and takes refuge with the station's owner, Alex Cavanaugh, who it turns out is the mastermind behind the drug ring.

The audience buzzed  with excitement and let out deafening cheers, the moment as they were introduced on the stage and then when Liu started the first sentence of their parts of the song. The two migrant workers became stars after singing the tearjerker song during an evening drinking session in a 6-square-meter rented room in a late August evening. A friend recorded the performance on a cell phone and posted it on the Internet. \\"If someday I am dead, please bury me in the spring,\\" they sing. Wang's penetrating chorus, delivered with his eyes closed, has moved thousands to tears. Wang and Liu consider the song a true portrait of lower-class groups like themselves. \\"With no credit card, no girlfriend, or a home with hot water, but only a guitar, I am singing happily, on streets, under bridges or in wild country, though nobody pays attention to the music,\\" they sing. To support his wife and two sons, Wang came to Beijing in 2000 from the countryside and has worked as a boiler man, and street peddler, before becoming a medical warehouse keeper, with a monthly pay of around 1,500 yuan. Little is left after he pays 600 yuan for rent and buys food. Liu came to Beijing in 2002. \\"I wanted to try my luck in the big city, \\" he said.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. You are given a new situation: Dan likes to experiment with different food items. Today, he wants to make curds out of milk and see how it differs from plain milk. For his experiment he collected three bottles of milk, bottle A, bottle B, and bottle C. Bottle A and bottle B milk are pasteurized, but bottle C milk is just raw milk. He kept the bottle A milk intact, but made curd out of bottle B and bottle C milk.  and a hint : Curds are a dairy product obtained by coagulating milk in a process called curdling. The coagulation can be caused by adding rennet or any edible acidic substance such as lemon juice or vinegar, and then allowing it to coagulate. The increased acidity causes the milk proteins (casein) to tangle into solid masses, or curds. Milk that has been left to sour (raw milk alone or pasteurized milk with added lactic acid bacteria) will also naturally produce curds, and sour milk cheeses are produced this way. Producing cheese curds is one of the first steps in cheesemaking; the curds are pressed and drained to varying amounts for different styles of cheese and different secondary agents (molds for blue cheeses, etc.) are introduced before the desired aging finishes the cheese. The remaining liquid, which contains only whey proteins, is the whey. In cow's milk, 90 percent of the proteins are caseins.  Please answer this question : Would bottle B milk need or not need added lactic acid bacteria to produce curd?","output":"Bottle B milk, which is pasteurized, would likely need added lactic acid bacteria to produce curd. This is because pasteurization involves heating the milk to a high temperature to eliminate unwanted bacteria and microorganisms. This process also tends to kill off the naturally occurring lactic acid bacteria present in raw milk, which are responsible for the fermentation process that leads to curdling. Therefore, to produce curd from pasteurized milk (such as bottle B milk), you would typically need to reintroduce lactic acid bacteria by adding a starter culture, like yogurt containing live cultures or a specific curdling agent, to initiate the coagulation process and form curds."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The premise explicitly states \\"During a soccer game, two players jump up to headbutt the ball.\\" This definitely implies that there are at least two individuals participating in a game of soccer, therefore validating the hypothesis \\"Two players are playing soccer.\\"  This statement is a direct scenario representing a game of soccer where two players are involved, which makes it clear that the players are participating to the extent of actively engaging in plays, such as trying to headbutt the ball, a common maneuver in the sport.  This means that, within the context given, the hypothesis \\"Two players are playing soccer\\" is not only possible but factual. Soccer is a team sport that requires multiple players, and the premise provided outlines an event that could only happen in such a context.  Therefore, based on the premise, we can concretely confirm the hypothesis as the actions described in the premise (jumping up to headbutt the ball) sufficiently validate the hypothesis. These actions clearly demonstrate an ongoing soccer match, thus establishing that at least two individuals are actively contributing to this game.  It's important to note that the validity of the hypothesis from the premise provided relies heavily on the understanding of the game mentioned. Soccer, by its nature, is a sport that involves multiple players, with two as the bare minimum for a very simplified version of the game. Furthermore, the action of headbutting the ball is unique to soccer and certain other sports, hence further supporting the claim that the players in the premise are indeed playing soccer.

Q:Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: GoDaddy has pulled the plug on another online peddler of violence. The popular internet registration service last week shut down altright.com, a website created by white nationalist leader Richard Spencer and popular with many in the so-called alt-right movement. The takedown is the latest example of how companies like GoDaddy are increasingly responding to growing public pressure to clamp down on violent sites in the wake of the deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last summer. GoDaddy, which registers domains for more than 75 million websites around the world, said it generally does not delist sites that promote hate, racism and bigotry on the ground that such content is protected as free speech. But it said altright.com had \\"crossed the line and encouraged and promoted violence in a direct and threatening manner.\\" \\"In instances where a site goes beyond the mere exercise of these freedoms, however, and crosses over to promoting, encouraging or otherwise engaging in specific acts of violence against any person, we will take action,\\" GoDaddy said in a statement emailed to VOA. The company would not say whether it canceled altright.com's domain registration in response to pressure but it stressed that \\"we take all complaints about content on websites very seriously, and have a team dedicated to investigate each complaint.\\" The Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a Washington-based civil rights organization, said it filed such a complaint with GoDaddy last month, citing several instances in which altright.com carried content that advocated violence. In one example, a January 26, 2018, article encouraged \\"use of live ammunition at the border, in order to create a substantial chance that they [immigrants crossing the border] lose their life in the process,\\" according to the organization's complaint. Kristen Clarke, the group's president and executive director, said the shutdown of altright.com was part of her organization's campaign to combat a recent \\"hate crime crisis\\" in the...

Protests can take many different forms, from individual statements to mass demonstrations. Protesters may organize a protest as a way of publicly making their opinions heard in an attempt to influence public opinion or government policy, or they may undertake direct action in an attempt to directly enact desired changes themselves. Where protests are part of a systematic and peaceful campaign to achieve a particular objective, and involve the use of pressure as well as persuasion, they go beyond mere protest and may be better described as cases of civil resistance or nonviolent resistance.  - In July 1972, William Whitelaw, the British government's Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, granted Special Category Status (SCS) to all prisoners convicted of Troubles-related offences. This had been one of the conditions set by the Provisional IRA when they negotiated a meeting with the British Government to discuss a truce.  - The blanket protest was part of a five-year protest during the Troubles by Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) prisoners held in the Maze prison (also known as \\"Long Kesh\\") in Northern Ireland. The republican prisoners' status as political prisoners, known as Special Category Status, had begun to be phased out in 1976. Among other things, this meant that they would now be required to wear prison uniforms like ordinary convicts. The prisoners refused to accept that they had been administratively designated as ordinary criminals, and refused to wear the prison uniform.  - The dirty protest (also called the no wash protest) was part of a five-year protest during the Troubles by Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) prisoners held in the Maze Prison (also known as \\"Long Kesh\\") and a protest at Armagh Women's Prison in Northern Ireland.  - Patrick \`\` Paddy '' Agnew ( born 8 March 1955 ) is a former IRA volunteer and was elected to Dáil Éireann during the 1981 Irish hunger strike . Agnew was born in Dundalk , County Louth , Ireland in 1955 . His grandfather , was also an Irish republican and an internee during the Irish War of Independence . Agnew was imprisoned at Portlaoise , Mountjoy , Crumlin Road and the H - Blocks of Long Kesh . He was involved in the blanket protest in the H - Blocks . Although he was not on hunger strike , he was elected as a Teachta Dála ( TD ) for the Louth constituency at the 1981 general election , topping the poll . He did not take his seat . This was along with Kieran Doherty , who was elected in Cavan -- Monaghan and died on hunger strike . Agnew was released from prison in 2000 and joined the Gerard Halpenny Sinn Féin cumann in Dundalk , where he remains an active member of the party .  - A hunger strike is a method of non-violent resistance or pressure in which participants fast as an act of political protest, or to provoke feelings of guilt in others, usually with the objective to achieve a specific goal, such as a policy change. Most hunger strikers will take liquids but not solid food.  - The Troubles is the common name for the ethno-nationalist conflict in Northern Ireland during the late 20th century. Also known internationally as the Northern Ireland conflict, it is sometimes described as a \\"guerrilla war\\" or \\"low-level war\\". The conflict began in the late 1960s and is usually deemed to have ended with the Good Friday \\"Belfast\\" Agreement of 1998. Although the Troubles mainly took place in Northern Ireland, violence spilled over at times into parts of the Republic of Ireland, England and mainland Europe.  - The 1981 Irish hunger strike was the culmination of a five-year protest during The Troubles by Irish republican prisoners in Northern Ireland. The protest began as the blanket protest in 1976, when the British government withdrew Special Category Status for convicted paramilitary prisoners. In 1978, after a number of attacks on prisoners leaving their cells to \\"slop out\\", the dispute escalated into the dirty protest, where prisoners refused to leave their cells to wash and covered the walls of their cells with excrement. In 1980, seven prisoners participated in the first hunger strike, which ended after 53 days.  - Northern Ireland (; Ulster Scots: \\"\\") is a top-level constituent unit of the United Kingdom in the northeast of Ireland. It is variously described as a country, province, region, or \\"part\\" of the United Kingdom, amongst other terms. Northern Ireland shares a border to the south and west with the Republic of Ireland. In 2011, its population was 1,810,863, constituting about 30% of the island's total population and about 3% of the UK's population. Established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement, the Northern Ireland Assembly holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters, while other areas are reserved for the British government. Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in some areas, and the Agreement granted the Republic the ability to \\"put forward views and proposals\\" with \\"determined efforts to resolve disagreements between the two governments\\".

A very early Oliver Stone (associate-)produced film, and one of the first films in the impressive career of Lloyd Kaufman (co-founder and president of the world's only real independent film studio Troma, creator of the Toxic Avenger and, at the prestigious Amsterdam Fantastic Filmfestival, lifetime-achievement awarded filmmaker for over 30 years). Having raised the money for this film on his own, Lloyd wrote this script together with Theodore Gershuni in 1970 and in hindsight regrets having listened to advice to have Gershuni else direct the film instead of doing it himself. But back then he was still inexperienced in the business and it is probably because of decisions like these that he takes no nonsense from anyone anymore. Indeed it would have been interesting to see Lloyd's version of his own script - as one of the world's most original, daring, experimental and non-compromising directors he probably would have given it even more edge than it already has. But as it is we have the Gershuni-directed film. And weather it is due to the strong script, or the fact that he too is indeed quite a director of his own, SUGAR COOKIES is a very intelligent, highly suspenseful and well-crafted motion picture that deserves a lot more attention than it receives. The shoestring budget the small studio (this was even before Kaufman and his friend and partner for over 30 years now, Michael Herz, formed Troma) had to work with is so well handled that the film looks a lot more expensive, indeed does not have a \\"low budget\\" look at all. The story revolves around lesbian Camilla Stone (played by enigmatic Mary Woronow) and her lover who winds up dead through circumstances I won't reveal not to spoil a delightful story. This leads to a succession of plot-twists, mind games and personality reform that is loosely inspired by Hitchcock's Vertigo and at least as inventive. The atmosphere is a lot grimmer, though, and some comparisons to Nicholas Roeg's and Donald Cammell's PERFORMANCE come to mind. In this mix is a very original and inventive erotic laden thriller that keeps it quite unclear as to how it is all going to end, which, along with a splendidly interwoven sub-plot with a nod to Kaufman's earlier and unfortunately unavailable BIG GUSS WHAT'S THE FUSS, makes for a very exciting one-and-a-half-hour. Certainly one of the best films in Troma's library, and yet again one of those films that defy the curious fantasy that their catalog is one of bad taste. The DVD includes some recent interviews Kaufman conducts with Woronov and the other leading lady Lynn Lowry (later seen in George Romero's THE CRAZIES), thus giving some interesting insight in what went on during the making of this cult-favorite and a few hints of what would be different had Lloyd directed it himself.

Sentence 1: He took a first-class single ticket to Bournemouth, Tommy did 52 the same. Sentence 2: Tommy and the other person got tickets to Bournemouth.

Sentence 1: \\"He took a first-class single ticket to Bournemouth, Tommy did 52 the same.\\" The sentence tells us that two people acquired first-class single tickets to Bournemouth; one referred to as \\"He\\" and the other as \\"Tommy.\\" Sentence 2: \\"Tommy and the other person got tickets to Bournemouth.\\" The sentence states that Tommy and another person both obtained tickets to Bournemouth. Step 2: Compare sentences and determine if Sentence 2 is entailed by Sentence 1.

Sentence 2 does not specify this detail about the tickets but it does convey the same idea of two people – Tommy and the other person – buying tickets to Bournemouth.

Write a title for this article: Hotel owners, tourism officials and would-be vacationers along the east coast were keeping a watchful eye on forecasts on Wednesday as tropical storm Arthur churned off Florida, threatening Fourth of July plans for thousands of people. A tropical storm warning was issued for parts of North Carolina as the first named storm of the season was expected to strengthen to a hurricane and skim the Outer Banks, a string of narrow barrier islands prone to flooding but popular for beachgoers, as a category one hurricane Friday. Wednesday's warning stretched across the entire North Carolina coast, from Little River Inlet near South Carolina north to the Virginia border. A tropical storm watch for Florida's east coast was canceled. The worst of the storm should occur at Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, around dawn on Friday, with 3 to 5 inches of rain and sustained winds up to 85 mph, said Tony Saavedra, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service, prompting officials to order a mandatory evacuation of the Island. Home to the famous Cape Hatteras Lighthouse, the island is a narrow spit of land, and the two-lane North Carolina highway 12 is the only way to the mainland other than ferries to the south. Twice in recent years, storm-driven waves have closed the highway. A voluntary evacuation was announced earlier for the Outer Banks' Ocracoke Island, which is accessible only by ferry. The storm should then move through quickly and be off the coast of New England later in the day, perhaps making landfall in Canada's maritime provinces as a tropical storm, he said. The motel Shutters on the Banks in Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, was completely booked for the holiday weekend, general manager John Zeller said on Tuesday, but he was considering waiving cancellation fees if the storm continued to track toward the area. \\"We have received some cancellations but not too many,\\" he said. \\"Basically we are telling people to kind of wait and see what happens. ... I think everybody is kind of watching the weather.\\" Late Wednesday morning, Arthur was about 105 miles (165km) east-northeast of Cape Canaveral and about 260 miles (420km) south-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina. It was moving north about 7 mph (11kph) with maximum sustained winds of 6 mph (95 kph). About an hour north of Cape Canaveral, the Hilton Daytona Beach Oceanfront Resort's holiday reservations were unaffected by the storm, general manager Tom Manno said. \\"In fact we're sold out right through Sunday,\\" he said. \\"So we haven't experienced any cancellations at all.\\" But some precautions were taken at the hotel. \\"We've gone through all the emergency procedures, the staff is confident, and everything is in place,\\" Manno said. \\"Right now the weather is good, the winds are pretty calm, and we're hoping it will remain that way.\\" On Florida's Gulf Coast, the National Weather Service says dry air rotating around Arthur reduced rain chances in the Tampa Bay area. But as the storm moves north, the rain chances will return — just in time for the holiday weekend. On Hilton Head Island, on South Carolina's southern tip, there was little concern about Arthur — the storm was forecast to pass the island on Thursday well out at sea. \\"It's a very busy week on Hilton Head Island. ... It will be a sold-out weekend,\\" said Charlie Clark, a spokeswoman for the Hilton Head Island Chamber of Commerce. \\"We're expecting a strong weekend and we're not getting calls from visitors asking what's up with this storm.\\" Title:","output":"Tropical Storm Arthur Threatens Fourth of July Plans on East Coast"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: Manny had Bob Marley cranking on the stereo, his van was full of passengers, and the air conditioning was working after a long week of giving him trouble. The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat. Get up, stand up, the radio cried out, and that was what Manny hoped would happen. He hoped that she would at least just stir and be okay. But she just lay there. Question: Why did Manny slow down? Options: - not enough information - the food cart owner stepped forward - the boy stepped off the sidewalk - tourists were on the road Answer:","output":"Manny slowed down because tourists were on the road."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

B. take life  C. misfire  D. arm robbers  E. break","output":"Step 1: Analyze the question and options. The question asks about what guns could do which could be illegal. This means we should look for an option that involves a direct negative consequence when using a gun illegally. Step 2: Eliminate options that do not involve direct negative consequences. A. distract police from a r3al (real) crime - This option does not present a direct negative consequence of using a gun. C. misfire - While a misfire can be dangerous, it is not a direct result of illegal use of a gun. Misfires can also happen in legal situations. E. break - A gun breaking does not have a direct connection to illegal usage.  Step 3: Choose the option with the most direct connection to illegal gun usage. Between options B and D, both involve illegal activities involving guns. However, option B (take life) represents a more direct and severe consequence of illegal gun usage, as it involves the potential loss of life, which is more significant than arming robbers.

Born John Christopher Depp II in Owensboro, Kentucky, on June 9, 1963, he began his acting career in the 1980s, with his breakthrough role coming in the 1990s with the television series \\"21 Jump Street.\\" Depp's portrayal of the Mad Hatter in \\"Alice Through the Looking Glass\\" built on his previous performance of the same character in the 2010 Tim Burton-directed film \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" - both of which are adaptations of the classic novels by Lewis Carroll. The novels include \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" (1865) and \\"Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There\\" (1871). Johnny Depp brought to life the whimsical, unpredictable, and enigmatic character of the Mad Hatter through a blend of striking visual transformations and his imaginative acting skills. His costume featured vibrant colors, mismatched patterns, and oversized accessories. Depp's performance blended zany humor with moments of emotion and vulnerability, as he explored the Hatter's complex background and relationships with other characters, particularly Alice (played by Mia Wasikowska). Throughout his career, Johnny Depp has been involved in a wide array of diverse and acclaimed film projects, including \\"Edward Scissorhands\\" (1990), \\"Ed Wood\\" (1994), \\"Donnie Brasco\\" (1997), \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" series (beginning in 2003), \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" (2005), \\"Sweeney Todd: the Demon Barber of Fleet Street\\" (2007), and \\"Black Mass\\" (2015), to name a few.

Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"A: While the initial response somewhat addresses the question, a detailed and long answer is as follows: The Somali flag was designed by Mohammed Awale Liban, an insightful Somali scholar and talented artist. The conception of the flag was linked to the Somali people's struggle for independence and the need for a symbol that would represent their culture, aspirations, and identity. The Somali flag was officially adopted on October 12, 1954, just a few years before Somalia gained independence from colonial rule on July 1, 1960. Mohammed Awale Liban was born in 1921 in the city of Taleh, situated in the Sool region of Somaliland, which is a self-declared autonomous region in northwestern Somalia. He was a man of outstanding vision and dedication, taking up the cause of the Somali people and their search for national identity. His training in artistic and scholarly pursuits enabled him to combine his creative vision with the political aspirations of the Somali people, culminating in the creation of the Somali flag. The design of the Somali flag features a single white, five-pointed star (the Star of Unity) centered on a light blue background. The five points of the star represent the five regions where ethnic Somalis reside: Djibouti, the Ogaden region in Ethiopia, the North East Province in Kenya, and the former British Somaliland and Italian Somaliland, which are now united as Somalia. The light blue background was chosen to symbolize the United Nations, which played a crucial role in assisting Somalia in its struggle for independence from colonial rule. The blue color also evokes the sky and the Indian Ocean, a significant source of sustenance and trade for the Somali people. The white color of the star symbolizes peace and the rebirth of Somalia after gaining its independence. In summary, the Somali flag was devised by Mohammed Awale Liban, a distinguished Somali scholar and artist who combined his creative talents with his political consciousness to create a visual symbol that could represent the aspirations, cultural identity, and unity of ethnic Somalis. The flag was officially adopted on October 12, 1954, and continues to be a potent symbol of unity, resilience, and hope for the Somali people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem.  Ben and Andy were two old friends. They both have high levels of cholesterol. Ben was prescribed cholesterol medication, while Andy didn't go to the doctor because he was careless.

He was prescribed cholesterol medication by his doctor to address the issue. On the other hand, Andy did not go to the doctor due to carelessness, and therefore did not receive any prescription medication or statins for his high cholesterol. The difference in their individual response to statins could be a result of their unique genetic background, which is characterized by different single nucleotide polymorphisms. These genetic variations can sometimes cause the statins to work differently in individuals - it may lower cholesterol significantly in some, moderately in others, or have no significant effect at all. Pharmacogenomics, a field that studies the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, aims to understand these differences and possibly optimize the use of medications like statins based on each person's genetic profile."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Based on the premise, Tito and Castro are mentioned as examples with the possibility of having imitators in the future. The premise also suggests uncertainty regarding the longevity of post-Soviet democracies. The hypothesis, on the other hand, implies an intent of showing that past rulers will always have imitators. The hypothesis focuses on the intent behind the imitators, while the premise suggests the possibility of imitators without mentioning an intent. Given this analysis, the answer is: --it is not possible to tell. The hypothesis cannot be conclusively determined to be true, based on the premise alone, as the focus of the premise is on the possibility of imitators and the uncertainty of post-Soviet democracies, whereas the hypothesis is about the intent behind the imitators."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It was a perfect day to have a picnic! As I sat down on the soft, green grass, I noticed a little squirrel running up and down a tree. The squirrel was having so much fun hiding nuts in the tree. He was storing them for the winter when the weather gets cold, and there are no more nuts to find. Suddenly, I saw a playful dog chasing a bright, round ball that his owner threw for him. The dog was very happy to catch the ball in his mouth and bring it back to his owner. They were playing a game called \\"fetch.\\" Nearby, a group of children laughed and played together on a colorful playground. They slid down the slides, swung on the swings, and climbed the jungle gym. They were having a great time making new friends and trying out all the fun equipment. Then, I saw a lady with a big, red balloon. She was giving the balloons to the little kids who walked by. The wind would carry the balloon up into the sky, and the children would hold onto the string to make sure it didn't fly away. But, if I wanted to see the future and know what would happen next, I would need those magic glasses. I don't know where to find them, but maybe someday I'll meet a magical creature who can help me.

This sumptuous sauce is known for its perfect balance of tangy tomatoes and pungent garlic, bringing together the savory, acidic, and sweet elements that make our taste buds dance with joy. Read on as we break down how to create this tasty sauce from scratch, walking you through each step in making your own mouthwatering, velvety smooth concoction. Ingredients To make a tomato garlic sauce, you'll need the following ingredients: - 2 tablespoons of olive oil - 4 cloves of garlic, minced or crushed - 1 (28-ounce) can of crushed tomatoes  - Salt and pepper, to taste - Optional: fresh basil, oregano, crushed red pepper flakes, Parmesan cheese Instructions 1. Have all ingredients prepared and measured before starting. Mince or crush the garlic to increase its surface area and release the maximum amount of flavor. Set aside a 28-ounce can of crushed tomatoes that have been strained, if preferred, to remove excess liquid and ensure a thicker sauce. 2. In a medium-sized saucepan, heat the two tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Use a high-quality olive oil since it adds richness and depth to the sauce. As the oil warms, swirl it around the saucepan to coat the surface evenly. 3. Add the minced or crushed garlic to the saucepan, sautéing it gently in the olive oil. It's crucial not to overcook the garlic as it becomes bitter when burnt. Stir the garlic continuously for approximately one to two minutes, or until it turns a fragrant golden brown. 4. Carefully pour the can of crushed tomatoes into the saucepan with the olive oil and garlic. The sudden addition of the liquid ingredients may cause the oil to sputter, so be cautious when combining. 5. Stir the tomatoes, olive oil, and garlic together, incorporating all the flavors into a uniform mixture. At this point, you may add optional ingredients such as fresh basil, oregano, or crushed red pepper flakes to tailor the sauce to your preferences. Continue to stir the sauce over medium heat for about 20 to 30 minutes, allowing the sauce to simmer and gradually thicken. 6. While the sauce simmers, periodically taste and season with salt and pepper as needed. The key to a well-balanced sauce is adjusting the seasoning to your liking, so don't be afraid to customize the flavor profile to suit your tastes.  7. Remove the sauce from the heat once it reaches your desired consistency and thickness. If you desire an even smoother sauce, you can use an immersion blender or carefully transfer the sauce to a conventional blender (in batches, if necessary). Remember to let the sauce cool a bit before blending to avoid injury by hot splatters. 8. Your tomato garlic sauce is now ready to be used in a variety of dishes or stored for future use. Allow the sauce to cool to room temperature before transferring it to an airtight container. The sauce can be stored in the refrigerator for up to one week or frozen for several months. Conclusion Prepared with love and simple ingredients, this homemade tomato garlic sauce is the perfect addition to your kitchen repertoire. Its rich, robust flavor profile and versatility make it an ideal base for various recipes, ensuring that your friends and family will be begging for seconds. Create your personalized tomato garlic sauce today and elevate your culinary accomplishments with its deliciously inviting aroma and taste."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

One of the most practical and cost-effective ways to eliminate shoe odors is by using a simple yet potent combination of baking soda and essential oils. Baking soda gently absorbs odors, while essential oils add a refreshing and pleasant fragrance to your shoes. In this article, we'll explain the step-by-step process of freshening up your shoes using baking soda and essential oils. Supplies Needed: - 2 tablespoons of baking soda - 5 drops of essential oil (of your choice) - A small bowl - A fork - A measuring spoon (1 tablespoon) Procedure: 1. Prepare the mixture To begin, pour 2 tablespoons of baking soda into a small bowl. This will be the base of your deodorizing mixture. Next, add 5 drops of your chosen essential oil for fragrance. You can use any essential oil you prefer, such as lavender, lemon, eucalyptus or tea tree oil. Each of these oils offers a distinct and pleasing scent that will help eliminate the unpleasant odors coming from your shoes. Combine the baking soda and essential oil by stirring them together with a fork until the mixture is evenly blended. 2. Apply the mixture to your shoes Using a measuring spoon, scoop up 1 tablespoon of the baking soda mixture, and pour it into the heel of each shoe. Make sure the mixture is evenly distributed by gently tapping the heel against a hard surface or shaking the shoe. This will help send the baking soda into the toe area of the shoe, covering more of the internal surface. 3. Allow the shoes to sit Let the shoes sit with the baking soda mixture inside for several hours or preferably overnight. The longer you leave the mixture in the shoes, the more time it will have to absorb the odors and freshen your shoes with the pleasing fragrance of the essential oils. You can leave your shoes in a well-ventilated area or outside during this process to further help eliminate shoe odors. 4. Dispose of the baking soda mixture After several hours or the following day, take the shoes and tilt them downward, allowing the excess baking soda to fall out into a trash can or sink. Gently tap the shoes against a hard surface to help remove any remaining baking soda from inside. Make sure not to inhale the baking soda dust while doing this step. 5. Repeat as necessary If your shoes still have a lingering odor or if you have multiple pairs to treat, simply repeat steps 1-4 as needed. It's important to note that this method works best on shoes made of fabric or canvas material. For leather shoes, it's advisable to use a specialized leather cleaner and conditioner instead to avoid damaging the shoes. Conclusion Freshening up your shoes with baking soda and essential oils is a simple and cost-effective solution for eliminating shoe odors. It not only helps remove unpleasant smells, but it also leaves your shoes smelling fresh and clean, improving the overall feel and comfort of wearing them. By incorporating this routine into your shoe care regimen, you can extend the life of your shoes while maintaining a pleasant and welcoming aroma."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He can't get backstage, but opening band Stillwater arrives, and after he flatters them with critical praise they bring him along.

Feigning retirement from her glory days, she takes William under her wing, but only to get close to Russell, for whom she has genuine feelings. William is contacted by Ben Fong-Torres, editor of Rolling Stone, who believes him to be older and hires him to write a story.

Given the question \\"How would Jesse feel afterwards?\\", is \\"targeted and at risk on the bus\\" a valid answer? A:","output":"Yes, \\"targeted and at risk on the bus\\" can indeed be considered a valid answer to the question \\"How would Jesse feel afterwards?\\".  This question is asking about the emotional or psychological aftermath that Jesse might experience after being harassed on the bus. Therefore, the feelings of being targeted and feeling at risk are plausible responses. Feeling targeted may stem from the fact that Jesse was singled out and harassed amidst other passengers, this can create a perception in Jesse's mind, a sentiment that he was the specific target of the harasser's actions. Feeling 'at risk' on the bus could arise from the concern Jesse may have about the prospect of such an incident happening again. It suggests that Jesse might now perceive the bus as an unsafe environment, creating a sense of potential continuous threat. This feeling of vulnerability or insecurity may persist not only on that particular bus but could also extend to similar public spaces or means of transport. Every individual responds to harassment differently. While it's not universally true that everyone who experiences harassment will feel \\"targeted\\" or \\"at risk,\\" it's certainly a valid possibility that many people might feel this way. People who have been harassed often report feelings of being singled out, vulnerable and unsafe, which aligns with feelings of being targeted and at risk. Regardless of if it's common or not, these feelings are valid and are to be taken seriously. Bad experiences can often lead to fear, anxiety or a sense of insecurity. Repeated exposure to such conditions could potentially lead to the development of a wide range of mental health issues, like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorders, among others. Therefore, given this scenario, the answer \\"targeted and at risk on the bus\\" can indeed be considered a valid response to how Jesse might feel after the ordeal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:This article: Beginning on December 11, 1945, Stafford hosted the Tuesday and Thursday broadcasts of NBC musical variety radio program The Chesterfield Supper Club. On April 5, 1946, the entire cast, including Stafford and Perry Como, participated in the first commercial radio broadcast from an airplane. The initial plan was to use the stand-held microphones used in studios but when these proved to be problematic, the cast switched to hand-held microphones, which because of the plane's cabin pressure became difficult to hold. Three flights were made that day; a rehearsal in the afternoon, then two in the evening—one for the initial 6:00 pm broadcast and another at 10:00 pm for the West Coast broadcast.Stafford moved from New York to California in November 1946, continuing to host Chesterfield Supper Club from Hollywood. In 1948, she restricted her appearances on the show to Tuesdays, and Peggy Lee hosted the Thursday broadcasts. Stafford left the show when it was expanded to 30 minutes, making her final appearance on September 2, 1949. She returned to the program in 1954; it ended its run on NBC Radio the following year. During her time with Chesterfield Supper Club, Stafford revisited some of the folk music she had enjoyed as a child. Weston, her conductor on the programme, suggested using some of the folk music for the show. With her renewed interest in folk tunes came an interest in folklore; Stafford established a contest to award a prize to the best collection of American folklore submitted by a college student. The annual Jo Stafford Prize for American Folklore was handled by the American Folklore Society, with the first prize of 250 awarded in 1949. contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that restricted her appearance on the show to only Tuesdays?, what is it ?

Answer the question...what band plays at the end of 10 things i hate about you??","output":"The band playing at the end of the movie 10 Things I Hate About You is Letters to Cleo, an American rock band from Boston, Massachusetts. The movie, released in 1999, is a romantic comedy inspired by William Shakespeare's play, The Taming of the Shrew. Letters to Cleo, formed in 1990, gained significant popularity in the '90s with a series of successful albums and singles. The band's music is characterized by energetic rock, catchy melodies, and powerful vocals by the lead singer, Kay Hanley. Their sound is often reminiscent of the alternative rock and power pop that dominated the mid-to-late '90s. At the end of 10 Things I Hate About You, Letters to Cleo appears on the rooftop of Padua High School and performs two songs – \\"Cruel to Be Kind\\" and \\"I Want You to Want Me.\\" The former is a cover of a 1979 Nick Lowe single, while the latter is a cover of a 1977 song by Cheap Trick. \\"Cruel to Be Kind\\" is played when Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) buys Kat Stratford (Julia Stiles) a guitar, and they share a moment together. \\"I Want You to Want Me\\" is played over the closing credits, with the band performing on the rooftop and the students looking on from below. The inclusion of Letters to Cleo in this movie helped raise the band's profile and contributed to the overall fun and spirited atmosphere of the film. The band stayed active until 2000 before taking a long hiatus. They reunited in 2008 and 2016 for a series of shows, and continue to occasionally perform together."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The track was later included in the 1985 reissue of Madonna's second studio album, \\"Like a Virgin.\\" Interestingly, the song was not released as a single in the United States, so it did not chart on the Billboard Hot 100. The track was written and produced by Madonna and her then-boyfriend Stephen Bray. The song features synthesizers, drums, and bass guitar, and its danceable beats, infectious groove, and catchy melody contributed to its worldwide success. \\"Into the Groove\\" made its way to the top of the UK Singles Chart on August 3, 1985, and stayed there for four consecutive weeks. The song was Madonna's first number one single in the UK, and it marked the beginning of her domination of the British pop charts in the 1980s and 1990s. Over the years, Madonna went on to achieve a total of 13 UK number one singles, making her one of the most successful pop artists in British chart history. Aside from its commercial success, \\"Into the Groove\\" has been the subject of heavy praise from critics. The song has been hailed as one of Madonna's greatest tracks and an essential entry in the pop music canon. It has been noted for its innovation in dance-pop music and its influence on future generations of artists. \\"Into the Groove\\" has also appeared on numerous \\"best-of\\" lists, and it remains a favorite among Madonna's fans and music enthusiasts alike.

Madame White Snake: East Asian Femme Fatale of Old The Chinese legend of Madame White Snake, the snake demon that takes human form and becomes the wife of a man, has exerted a lasting influence over East Asian folktales and fiction for centuries. Two quintessential novellas, \\"The Lust of the White Serpant\\" from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and \\"Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda\\" a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal. While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale's transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it. Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband. But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and the persona of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even a model of the ideal Confucian wife, particularly in \\"Pagoda\\". Whalen Lai notes, \\"She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man. She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female, particularly forbearance\\". But if she were really an ideal wife, why could she not live happily with her human mate? Her dangerous sexuality is the key. Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre-modern Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife, since it is primarily associated with film characters, particularly those of the film noir genre. But this term, which is relatively speaking, a neologism (The earliest uses were around the beginning of the 20th century  Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"The fish demon that takes human form and becomes the wife of a man\\" correctly answer the question \\"How has the character \\"Madame White Snake\\" evolved over time?\\"?","output":"No, the response \\"The fish demon that takes human form and becomes the wife of a man\\" does not correctly answer the question \\"How has the character \\"Madame White Snake\\" evolved over time?\\" The given paragraph explains that Madame White Snake evolved from a villainous demon to a more complex and sympathetic character, even taking on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female, such as being a loving wife, a caring mother, and a general benefactor of man."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Assuming that:  As the Universe expands, galaxies move further and further apart. A:","output":"When a city \\"contracts,\\" the distance across the city decreases. The concept of the city contracting implies that it is shrinking in size, either due to a decrease in population, consolidation of buildings and infrastructure, or some other factors. As a result of this reduction, the distances between various points within the city become shorter, and the overall distance across the city decreases. However, it is essential to keep in mind that this is not the same phenomenon as the expansion of the Universe. The expansion of the Universe alludes to the increasing distances between galaxies due to the stretching of the fabric of spacetime. These processes occur on different scales and have different underlying mechanisms - the contraction of a city is governed by social, economic, and environmental factors, whereas the expansion of the Universe is driven by fundamental forces of nature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This article: John of Ephesus' account describes the events around the Christianization of Alodia in detail. As the southernmost of the three Nubian kingdoms, Alodia was the last to be converted to Christianity. According to John, the Alodian King was aware of the conversion of Nobadia in 543 and asked him to send a bishop who would also baptize his people. The request was granted in 580, leading to the baptism of the King, his family and the local nobility. Thus, Alodia became a part of the Christian world under the Coptic Patriarchate of Alexandria. After conversion, several pagan temples, such as the one in Musawwarat es-Sufra, were probably converted into churches. The extent and speed with which Christianity spread among the Alodian populace is uncertain. Despite the conversion of the nobility, it is likely that Christianization of the rural population would have proceeded slowly, if at all.Between 639 and 641, Muslim Arabs conquered Egypt from the Byzantine Empire. Makuria, which by this time had been unified with Nobadia, fended off two subsequent Muslim invasions, one in 641/642 and another in 652. In the aftermath, Makuria and the Arabs agreed to sign the Baqt, a peace treaty that included a yearly exchange of gifts and socioeconomic regulations between Arabs and Nubians. Alodia was explicitly mentioned in the treaty as not being affected by it. While the Arabs failed to conquer Nubia, they began to settle along the western coast of the Red Sea. They founded the port towns of Aydhab and Badi in the 7th century and Suakin, first mentioned in the 10th century. From the 9th century, they pushed further inland, settling among the Beja throughout the Eastern Desert. Arab influence would remain confined to the east of the Nile until the 14th century. contains an answer for the question: What kingdom converted to Christianity before Alodia?, what is it ?","output":"The kingdom that converted to Christianity before Alodia is Nobadia.

Options: - selling out - hitting the jackpot - receiving money - happy - getting paid  Explain why a human would choose \\"receiving money\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"receiving money\\" as the answer to the question above because it best aligns with the context provided and accurately reflects the outcome of a legal judgment involving compensation after an accident. Let's analyze each option to see why \\"receiving money\\" is the most suitable choice. 1. Selling out: This phrase refers to compromising one's integrity, principles, or ideals in exchange for personal gain or success. It does not relate to the context of a judge's ruling or receiving money after an accident. Therefore, this option can be eliminated from consideration. 2. Hitting the jackpot: This expression is often used when referring to winning a large sum of money, usually in a game of chance, such as lottery or gambling. Although it might suggest receiving a large monetary award, it does not accurately depict the legal context and the specificity of a judge's ruling in the given question. Thus, it is not the best choice. 3. Receiving money: The phrase \\"receiving money\\" directly relates to the concept of obtaining monetary compensation. In the context of the question, the judge's ruling implies that the person involved in the accident would be granted financial compensation. Therefore, this is the most fitting answer, as it accurately represents the outcome of the legal judgment and aligns with the context provided in the question. 4. Happy: While being happy could be a potential emotional state experienced by the individual after the accident (as a result of the judge's ruling), it doesn't specifically address the question of what the individual would be receiving in full. As such, this option does not provide a direct answer to the query and can be dismissed. 5. Getting paid: Though \\"getting paid\\" may seem closely related to \\"receiving money,\\" it implies a regular income or compensation typically associated with employment or providing a service. In the context of a legal judgment following an accident, \\"receiving money\\" is a more appropriate term to describe the compensatory payment that the person would be awarded. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"receiving money\\" as the answer because it directly relates to the question's context, accurately reflects the outcome of a legal judgment, and adheres to the specific situation of monetary compensation being awarded after an accident."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

If the Olive Garden is the best Italian restaurant in your home town, then you will probably think this is the best place you have ever been too. If you do not want to deal with off the boat Italian servers who give you bad service and complain (right in front of you) when you give them a 20% tip, then go somewhere better. Select from the following. 1). negative 2). positive","output":"1). Negative The review can be considered negative based on several factors stated by the reviewer. These factors include the customer's perception of the restaurant being overpriced, issues with the servers, and apparent disappointment with the overall quality of the establishment compared to other restaurants. Firstly, the reviewer explicitly describes the restaurant as \\"overpriced.\\" This indicates that they did not think the quality of the food or the experience was worth the amount they paid. An overpriced tag contributes to a negative review since customers expect to receive value for their money. Moreover, the comparison to Olive Garden seems to be a negative point in the reviewer's opinion. The reviewer suggests that if Olive Garden is considered the best in a person's hometown, then that person would probably find this restaurant to be superior. However, this implies that the reviewer does not think highly of Olive Garden and therefore does not view this as a favorable aspect of the restaurant under review. Next, the reviewer even highlighted an issue they had with the staff, particularly \\"off the boat Italian servers\\" who provided bad service and complained in front of the customers after receiving a 20% tip. This kind of behavior can be frustrating for customers and would contribute to an overall negative impression of the restaurant. Lastly, the reviewer suggests that there are better alternatives to the restaurant in question. This recommendation to \\"go somewhere better\\" implies that the reviewer thinks the overall experience at this restaurant is subpar compared to other establishments. This statement further reinforces the negative opinion expressed throughout the review. Taken together, these factors reveal the reviewer's dissatisfaction with the restaurant and result in a negative assessment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: To discipline means to teach. To be well disciplined is to have learned to live in accordance with the sensible rules and regulations that society has set up for the behavior of its members. Unless the child learns from each disciplinary situation how better to govern his conduct, effective discipline has not been developed. Parents must accept for themselves the idea that successful discipline results in learning. When they approach situations in which a child must adapt themselves to demands made upon them as learning situations, many problems usually thought of in connection with discipline disappear. Unfortunately, the word discipline has come to have other less constructive meanings. Far too often discipline is thought of as punishment. To many people, to discipline a child means to spank him or use some other method of punishment. Such people consider discipline a way of either keeping a child from doing something or of forcing him to do something. It is the task of parents to build within themselves and within the children with whom they live this capacity for self-direction, based upon an understanding of what is required of individuals in a democratic society. This means learning to act in those ways known to be necessary for the \\"good life\\", not for one's self alone but also for others. Developing the capacity for self-discipline in a child is a long, slow process. Much patience is required on the part of the parents. During this development, it is important that the child's self- confidence and comfortable acceptance of himself should never be sacrificed in a disciplinary battle; instead it should be increased through the ways in which his parents meet disciplinary situations. Many parents show a good deal of impatience if the little child does not rapidly learn how to keep clean, eat well, be orderly, and do what he is told. They are so eager for him to achieve these things that they seem to try to push him rapidly through his baby period. They seem also to think that learning to do these things...

Answer the following question: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Years back, following a transition inside a large company where many people got fired and moved around, the decision was made to give the remaining people more work. Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It’s not what you hired me for, and it’s not what you pay me for. When my boss replied, “Our company is not in the position to pay for two roles”, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2. And by the way, I don’t ever want to have this discussion again. If you want Superman performance, you cannot pay Clark Kent wages. 1 year passed and I was never bothered again about BA roles. Takeaways: Middle managers are one step above one-celled organisms. They can, and will try to get you to do non-role work, with no intention of ever paying you more. They key is to cut it off at the pass.

He’s joining the ranks of big names like Johnny Carson, Conan O’Brien and Jay Leno who’ve said goodbye to their shows. Here are the biggest laughs and most emotional moments from late-night finales. (Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post)      On Wednesday night, David Letterman — the longest-reigning late-night host in television history — officially ended his run on “The Late Show” with a historic final episode.      The 80-minute episode was packed with celebrity guests, video montages, flashbacks of famous sketches and much gratitude from the host, who thanked a long list of people who helped build his historic career.      Here’s a complete recap, starting with four presidents and ending with an emotional performance by Letterman’s favorite band, the Foo Fighters.      [David Letterman taught us to ward off celebrity stupidity. But stupidity won.]      11:35 p.m.: “Our long national nightmare is over.” Those are the words that kick off the episode, with previously filmed lines from George H.W. Bush; George W. Bush; Bill Clinton and President Obama.      “Letterman is retiring,” Obama adds. All of a sudden, Letterman appeared next to him: “You’re just kidding, right?” he asked. Cue faux-serious looks to the camera.      11:37 p.m.: Letterman walks out on stage to massive applause — of course, he can’t settle down the audience, chanting “Dave! Dave! Dave!”      “Stop right there,” Letterman commanded. “See, now what happens? We don’t have time for ‘giving gifts to the audience’ segment.”      11:39 p.m.: “I’ll be honest … it’s beginning to look like I’m not going to get ‘The Tonight Show,'” Letterman says. (Who had first “Tonight Show” reference at four minutes into the monologue? Collect your winnings.)      Lots of retirement jokes: When did Letterman know it was time to retire? When Todd, the cue card kid, “came up to me and said ‘For the love of God, Dave, I can’t write the words any bigger.'”      11:41 p.m.: A new segment: “Comedy We Would Have Done Tomorrow” includes jokes about Hillary Clinton and “Mad Max,” of course.      One downside to not having your own show anymore, Letterman adds: When he messes up, he’s going to have to go on someone else’s show to apologize.      11:44 p.m.: The hottest show when Letterman first started in late-night? “Keeping Up with the Gabors,” of course! (See, he really loves Zsa Zsa Gabor.)      Letterman also finds it suspicious that Elian Gonzales now decides he wants to come back to America — should Dave be offended?      11:46 p.m.: Paul Shaffer gets a shout-out: “My good friend Paul, more than a guy who’s on television with me every night, a great friend, best friend and a wonderful guy.” Letterman claims he and Paul are taking their show to Vegas with their white tigers.      Throw in a “Wheel of Fortune” sight gag, and that concludes the monologue:      I'd like to solve the puzzle. pic.twitter.com/b7RxanEGy5 — Dave Itzkoff (@ditzkoff) May 21, 2015      11:53: Before we go any further, Letterman has a quick word to his replacement, Stephen Colbert: “I’m very excited, I think he’s going to do a wonderful job, and I wish Stephen and his staff and crew nothing but the best.”      Flashback time: Letterman over the years chatting with kids. He’s got a natural rapport, especially when making fun of their science projects. “The kids love me, ladies and gentleman,” he says.      12:04 a.m.: Final Top 10 list — the category is “Top 10 Things I’ve Always Wanted to Say to Dave.” It’s a celebrity-studded presentation: “I appreciate their time, their talents and their generosity,” Letterman says as the line-up began.      10) Alec Baldwin: “Of all the talk shows, yours is most geographically convenient to my home.”      9) Barbara Walters: “Did you know that you wear the same cologne as Muammar Qaddafi?”      8) Steve Martin: “Your extensive plastic surgery was a necessity and a mistake.”      7) Jerry Seinfeld: “I have no idea what I’ll do when you go off the air. You know, I just thought something — I’ll be fine.”      6) Jim Carrey: “Honestly, Dave, I’ve always found you to be a bit of an over-actor.”      5) Chris Rock: “I’m just glad your show is being given to another white guy.” (“You know, I had nothing to do with that,” Letterman shot back.)      4) Julia Louis-Dreyfus: “Thanks for letting me take part in another hugely disappointing series finale.” (Naturally, the camera panned to Seinfeld looking distraught. Letterman: “I had nothing to do with that either!”)      3) Peyton Manning: “You are to comedy what I am to comedy.”      2) Tina Fey: “Thanks for finally proving men can be funny.”      1) Bill Murray: “I’ll never have the money I owe you.”      Letterman goes down the line and thanks every single one of them — and seems most excited about Peyton Manning.      12:15 a.m.: “Tremendous to see those people,” Letterman says of his Top 10 crew. “What a thrill, and I can’t begin to articulate my feelings for each and everyone of them over the years.” He continues to gush about Manning. “Did you notice me standing next to Peyton Manning, it’s like we’re twins?”      12:17 a.m.: Flashback to one of Letterman’s most famous bits from June 1996: The time he took over the drive-thru window at Taco Bell.      12:27 a.m.: A taped bit about a day in the life of Dave — here’s what he does on a typical workday:      Rolls up to the Ed Sullivan Theater in a chauffeured SUV wearing cargo pants and carrying a duffle bag.      Meets with executive producer Barbara Gaines, who chats about the guests coming up for the night.      Lots of meetings and ringing phones.      Apparently goes to the gym, then sits back and throws peanuts into a glass of water in his office. “You know what I’m going to devote the rest of my life to?” he asks the person behind the camera. “Social media.”      Monologue rehearsal. “How come when Bieber crashes the high school prom it’s cool, when I do it, it’s creepy?”      More show prep: Letterman watches White House correspondents’ dinner footage to get ideas for jokes.      Quick rundown of the show in a conference room — Paul Shaffer briefly crashes.      Dave runs on stage for the show.      David Letterman saying goodbye. (Jeffrey R. Staab/CBS)      12:37 a.m.: Letterman gets serious and runs down his list of thank-yous.      “The last six weeks, it’s been crazy. People have been saying lovely things about us and it’s really been over the top. I can’t tell you how flattering, embarrassing and gratifying it has all been,” he says.      “We’ve done over 6,000 shows,” he continues. “I was here for most of them — and I can tell you a pretty high percentage of those shows just absolutely sucked. And also in light of all of this praise, merited or not, do me a favor: Save a little for my funeral.”      He recalls visiting the Ed Sullivan Theater when he came to CBS, which was a total dump — it was crawling with rats and not fit for human consumption, Letterman swears. He thanks everyone who turned it into the beautiful theater it is now.      To CBS Corporation CEO Les Moonves: “This man, over the years, has been a friend to the show, he’s been very supportive of the show and he’s been more than patient with me. And if this was a printed sheet of paper, you could underline ‘patient’ several dozen times. So I would like to thank Mr. Moonves for that support.”      Outside the theater on Wednesday. (Andrew Burton/Getty Images)      He thanks all the behind-the-scenes people: Props, audio cameras, wardrobe, makeup, etc. “These people, night after night, have put up with my nonsense and taken care of not just me but everybody on the show.”      More gratitude: The staff, the researchers, the talent coordinators, segment producers, producers, people in the control room. (He asks them to keep it to just three drinks for the last night.)      The writers: “I have been blessed and lucky to work with men and women who are smarter than I am and funnier than I am and I have always been interested in doing the show that the writers have given me. These people that I collectively have just now mentioned and introduced, believe me, this is absolutely the truth, deserve more credit for this show than I ever will. Thank you to all of those people.”      Even more thanks: Announcer Alan Kalter; Biff Henderson; the band; and his good friend, “as good a friend as you can have in life,” band leader Paul Shaffer. “It’s so obvious every night and again tonight that they are so much better at their job than I am at my job.”      12:42 a.m.: Letterman thanks his beloved mom, a frequent guest. His mom’s response when he invited her on the show for the first time: “You have a show?”      He thanks his wife, Regina, and 11-year-old son, Harry. They’re in the audience, a rare scene — the audience gives them both a standing ovation. “Look at that kid!” Letterman beams. “Thank you for being my family. I love you both. And really, nothing else matters, does it?”      12:44 a.m.: Now, time for the fans: “The people who watch this show, there’s nothing I can do to ever repay you. Thank you for everything. You’ve given me everything. Thank you again.”      The Foo Fighters perform (Jeffrey R. Staab/CBS(      12:45 a.m.: Foo Fighters time.      “These people saved my life,” Letterman says of the band, recalling the days of his open-heart surgery. He requested the band on his first episode back to play a song that was especially meaningful to him during his recovery (“Everlong”), but it turned out they were on tour in South America. But then they canceled the tour — and made it back in time to play the song. “Happily, ever since, we’ve been joined at the hip. God bless you gentlemen,” he says, gesturing to Dave Grohl and the band.      “Alright, that’s pretty much all I got,” Letterman concludes. “The only thing I have left to do, for the last time on a television program: Thank you. And good night.”      With that, the band launches into “Everlong,” while a montage of Letterman scenes from the last 33 years plays on the screen.            David Letterman gets a standing ovation from the audience. (Jeffrey R. Staab/CBS)      On May 20, David Letterman hosted his last show, ending a 33-year career on late-night television.

Letterman signed off Wednesday... (Associated Press)      A picture of David Letterman hangs outside the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York, Wednesday, May 20, 2015. After 33 years and 6,028 broadcasts of his late-night show, David Letterman is retiring. (AP Photo/Seth... (Associated Press)      The show ran 17 minutes over the usual hour, much of it because Letterman took the time to thank the people who worked for him. As the tuxedoed Foo Fighters performed \\"Everlong\\"— a song they first played on the \\"Late Show\\" when Letterman returned after heart surgery in 2000 — a long montage of photographs from three decades of television history zipped past on the screen.      \\"The only thing I have left to do for the last time on a television program (is say) thank you and good night,\\" he said.      Letterman presided over 6,028 broadcasts on CBS and NBC, the transplanted Hoosier making Top 10 lists and ironic humor staples of television comedy and an influence to a generation of performers. True to his self-deprecating style, he said Stephen Hawking estimated that tenure delivered \\"about eight minutes of laughter.\\"      Letterman will be replaced in September by Stephen Colbert, who he endorsed by saying, \\"I think he'll do a wonderful job.\\"      The taped intro of President Barack Obama and former Presidents George Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush referenced President Gerald Ford's declaration to the country when he took office following the 1974 resignation of Richard Nixon. Letterman sidled up to Obama to say, \\"you're just kidding, right?\\"      Ten stars from Steve Martin to Tina Fey delivered the final Top 10 list of \\"things I've always wanted to say to Dave.\\" Julia Louis-Dreyfus, with Jerry Seinfeld standing nearby, said, \\"Thanks for letting me take part in another hugely disappointing series finale.\\"      No. 1 was Bill Murray: \\"Dave, I'll never have the money I owe you.\\"      Letterman joked in his monologue that he's been on the air for so long that the hot show when he started was \\"Keeping Up with the Gabors.\\"      \\"You want to know what I'm going to do now that I'm retired?\\" he said. \\"By God, I hope to become the new face of Scientology.\\"      From his start on NBC's \\"Late Night\\" in February 1982, Letterman's comedy was about more than telling jokes. He attached a camera to a monkey's back, tossed watermelons off a roof and wore a suit of Alka-Seltzer to plunge into a tank of water. Celebrities used to being fawned over either clicked with his prickly personality or didn't, and when Cher called him a more profane version of \\"jerk,\\" it became a memorable moment.      He shifted to CBS in 1993 when NBC gave the \\"Tonight\\" show to Jay Leno instead of Letterman, a slight he never forgot or forgave.      Letterman even began his final monologue Wednesday by joking, \\"It's beginning to look like I'm not going to get the 'Tonight' show.\\"      The tricks subsided as Letterman mellowed with age and fatherhood. His audience welcomed him back after a heart bypass, listened as he became the first late-night host back on the air after the 2001 terrorist attacks and saw him acknowledge to inappropriately having sex with a subordinate.      \\"When I screw up now, and Lord knows I'll be screwing up, I'll have to go on somebody else's show to apologize,\\" Letterman said.      With his monologue and Top 10 list, the final show kept the same format of thousands before them, although he gave no one the pressure of being a guest on the final show. Murray played that part Tuesday night. His last few weeks have been warmly nostalgic, with Letterman entertaining old friends like Tom Hanks, George Clooney, Julia Roberts and Oprah Winfrey. Anticipating the end, viewers sent Letterman to the top of the late-night ratings the week before last for the first time since Jimmy Fallon took over at \\"Tonight\\" and they competed with original telecasts.      Letterman, before saying goodbye, thanked virtually everyone involved with the show from CBS Corp. Chairman Leslie Moonves to his researchers and crew members.      \\"It's so obvious every night and again tonight that they were so much better at their jobs than I am at my job,\\" he said.      Letterman remained dry-eyed throughout the broadcast, but several audience members who filed out of the Ed Sullivan Theater had tears in their eyes.      \\"He was guarded but you could tell it was really hard for him,\\" said John Bernstein, who flew in from Los Angeles to attend the final taping. \\"You could see his emotion. But I think he's feeling a lot more than he's showing.\\"      Rival Jimmy Kimmel paid tribute to Letterman by not making a fresh ABC show on Wednesday, when he usually competes in the same time slot. Fallon opened his Wednesday monologue by saying: \\"I want to thank you for watching this on your DVR after you watched Letterman.\\"      ___      Online:      http://www.cbs.com/shows/late_show/ ||||| After 22 seasons, 4,262 episodes and tens of thousands of celebrity guests, it's no surprise David Letterman's departure from the Late Show is hitting a lot of stars pretty hard.

I know the people well.  The greatest number of them would starve themselves to that degree that they would not be of much more physical use in this world, before they would condescend to beg.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country.

His work includes architecture, furniture, textiles and glassware. Aalto's early career runs in parallel with the rapid economic growth and industrialization of Finland during the first half of the twentieth century and many of his clients were industrialists; among these were the Ahlström-Gullichsen family. The span of his career, from the 1920s to the 1970s, is reflected in the styles of his work, ranging from Nordic Classicism of the early work, to a rational International Style Modernism during the 1930s to a more organic modernist style from the 1940s onwards. His furniture designs were considered Scandinavian Modern. What is typical for his entire career, however, is a concern for design as a Gesamtkunstwerk, a \\"total work of art\\"; whereby he  together with his first wife Aino Aalto  would design not just the building, but give special treatments to the interior surfaces and design furniture, lamps, and furnishings and glassware. The Alvar Aalto Museum, designed by Aalto himself, is located in what is regarded as his home city Jyväskylä.  - Linnanmäki (colloquially \\"Lintsi\\", literal translation \\"Castle Hill\\") is an amusement park in Helsinki, Finland.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Bill and his family has been living in the six-family building for years. All the neighbors got along fairly well with each other until recently. An old man and his wife used to live on the second floor. Bill's mother and the old lady were good friends. Unfortunately the lady died last month. Her husband could not live alone, so he had his grandson move over and live with him. The grandson has become a problem to all the neighbors, especially to Bill's family. The walls of the building are thin and he is noisy. Bill is used to peace and quiet but the young man likes to listen to the radio late at night. Sometimes friends of his visit and they make a lot of noise. That is too much for Bill's family. Bill's mother once asked the old man politely if he was able to sleep well at night, but obviously the man didn't understand what she meant. If he did and spoke to his grandson, the young man obviously didn't listen, since things haven't changed any. Everyone in Bill's family agrees that something must be done though they don't want to hurt the kind old man. Question: The grandson makes a lot of noise as   _  . Options: A: he never thinks other people might not be happy with so much noise around B: the walls of the building are thin C: he likes to listen to the radio at night D: friends of his visit Answer:","output":"The grandson makes a lot of noise as a combination of factors: he likes to listen to the radio at night, the walls of the building are thin, and friends of his visit, which contribute to the overall noise levels. However, option A - \\"he never thinks other people might not be happy with so much noise around\\" - could also be a possible reason, as it indicates that he might be inconsiderate or unaware of the impact of his actions on his neighbors.  To fully analyze the situation, let us break down each option: A: He never thinks other people might not be happy with so much noise around. This could be true, as the grandson might be either inconsiderate or simply not aware of the inconvenience he is causing to his neighbors. This could be a primary reason why the noise issue has not been resolved despite Bill's mother's attempt to address it indirectly. B: The walls of the building are thin. This is an important factor contributing to the noise problem, as it makes it easier for sounds to travel through the walls and disturb neighboring apartments. However, it is not the sole reason for the noise, as the grandson's behavior is also causing excessive noise. C: He likes to listen to the radio at night. The article specifically mentions that the grandson enjoys listening to the radio late at night. This behavior is one of the primary sources of the noise problem and therefore is a valid reason. D: Friends of his visit. The friends' visits are another source of noise disturbance, as they contribute to the overall noise level experienced by Bill's family and eventually create discomfort among the neighbors. In conclusion, the grandson makes a lot of noise as a combination of factors, with his seemingly inconsiderate behavior being a significant contributing factor. Options C and D are specific examples of the noise sources, and option B indicates a structural issue with the building that exacerbates the problem. However, it is essential to note that a lack of consideration for others' comfort, as mentioned in option A, is also a key aspect of the situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who goes into labor? Title: You'll Like My Mother Movie plot: In this psychological thriller, a very pregnant Francesca (Patty Duke) travels from Los Angeles to Minnesota to meet her late husband's mother, Mrs. Kinsolving, whom she has never met before. Mrs. Kinsolving (Rosemary Murphy) is cold to Francesca, questions whether she is actually pregnant with her son's baby, and tells Francesca she wants nothing to do with her or her baby in the future. It soon becomes clear that Francesca cannot leave that night as a blizzard has made the roads impassable. Francesca is forced to stay in the Kinsolving mansion for a few days. She soon begins to suspect that something is amiss due to inconsistencies in information between what her late husband (Matthew) told her and Mrs. Kinsolving's statements to her. While Matthew never mentioned he had a sister, Mrs. Kinsolving claims that the mentally challenged and non-verbal Kathleen (Sian Barbara Allen) is Matthew's sister. After Mrs. Kinsolving retires for the night, Francesca sneaks around and discovers in the family Bible that Matthew's mother (Maria) died eleven days after Matthew was killed in the Vietnam War, that Mrs. Kinsolving is actually Maria's sister in law, Katherine, who is Kathleen's mother and the mother of Kenny (Richard Thomas), a serial rapist and murderer who is hiding somewhere in the Kinsolving mansion. Francesca goes into labor, but Mrs. Kinsolving refuses to call for an ambulance. She sedates Francesca heavily. When the baby is born, Mrs. Kinsolving announces it is dead and hands the baby over to Kathleen to bury. That night, Kathleen rouses Francesca and takes her to the attic where she finds Kathleen has hidden her baby (who is actually very much alive) in a picnic basket. Mrs. Kinsolving, suspecting Francesca is sneaking around the mansion, locks her in her room. Kathleen is able to locate the key to the room and unlocks it, allowing Francesca to care for her baby. One night, Francesca secretly spies the unsuspecting Kenny who is hiding in the basement laundry. She overhears his conversation with Mrs....

Researchers named the wide, shallow bay the most likely landing spot for the Roman fleet after excavators found the remains of a defensive base dating to the first century BC in the nearby hamlet of Ebbsfleet, near Ramsgate.            We came, we saw, we detected: relics from Caesar era among amateur finds Read more      The ancient base covered more than 20 hectares and would have been ideally placed to protect the 800 ships the Roman army had to haul ashore when they were battered by a storm soon after they arrived from France in 54BC.            “This is the first archaeological evidence we have for Julius Caesar’s invasion of Britain,” said Andrew Fitzpatrick, a researcher at the University of Leicester. “It’s a large defended site that dates to the first century BC.”            Facebook Twitter Pinterest Excavations at Ebbsfleet, with Pegwell Bay in the background. Photograph: Dean Barkley/University of Leice/PA      Archaeologists got their first glimpse of the Roman base while excavating land ahead of a new road project. They uncovered a deep defensive ditch that looks similar to Roman defences found at Alesia in France, site of the decisive battle in the 52BC Gallic war.            Further excavations uncovered bones that appear to have been damaged in fights and iron weapons, including a Roman pilum or javelin. The archaeologists believe the site included a Roman fort and served to protect Caesar’s ships from attackers coming from the north. “The main purpose of the site is to defend the fleet,” Fitzpatrick said.      The Roman general’s own account of the invasion describes how the fleet set off from France on the night of 4 July but got swept eastwards by currents when the wind failed. Early the next morning, the crew spotted England and rowed west to reach land at about noon.            The fleet was left at anchor at an even and open shore, Caesar wrote, but a high tide combined with a storm to wreak havoc on the ships, which broke anchor and smashed into one another. The general had the ships drawn onto the beach and set thousands of craftsmen to repair the damage.            Pegwell Bay had not been considered a viable landing site before because it lies on the Isle of Thanet, which was separated from mainland England until the middle ages by the Wantsum Channel. But the discovery of the Roman base makes the bay the most likely landing spot, Fitzpatrick said. “The Wantsum Channel wouldn’t have been a barrier to such accomplished engineers as the Roman army,” he said.            Facebook Twitter Pinterest The point of a Roman pilum found in the defensive ditch at Ebbsfleet. Photograph: University of Leicester/PA      Pegwell Bay is the only large bay on the east coast of Kent with an open sandy shore that could accommodate the vast fleet, the archaeologists believe. With at least 20,000 men and two thousand horses to disembark, the ships would have taken up more than a kilometre of beach when they arrived.            The British originally opposed the landing but on seeing the size of the fleet, retreated to higher ground, in positions that are now thought to be on the Isle of Thanet around Ramsgate.            While the Roman general returned to France without leaving an occupying army, the treaties Caesar set up between Rome and British royal families led to rulers of the south east of England becoming client kings of Rome. Those allegiances may have aided the invasion by the emperor Claudius nearly 100 years later in AD43.      “This was the beginning of the permanent Roman occupation of Britain, which included Wales and some of Scotland, and lasted for almost 400 years, suggesting that Claudius later exploited Caesar’s legacy,” said Colin Haselgrove at the University of Leicester. The findings will be explored as part of BBC Four’s Digging for Britain on Wednesday 29 November.       ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Archaeologists have identified Pegwell Bay as the place they believe the Romans landed      Archaeologists believe they may have uncovered the first evidence of Julius Caesar's invasion of Britain in 54BC.      The discovery of a defensive ditch and weapons led them to identify Pegwell Bay in Thanet, Kent, as the place they believe the Romans landed.      The ditch, in the nearby hamlet of Ebbsfleet, was part of a large fort, the University of Leicester team says.      Its location was consistent with clues provided by Caesar's own account of the invasion, the team said.

The 5m-wide ditch was discovered during an excavation ahead of a new road being built.      The university said its shape was very similar to Roman defences found in France.      It is thought it formed part of a large fort protecting Caesar's ships on the nearby beach.      Who was Julius Caesar?      Image copyright Getty Images      Born into a prestigious patrician family in 100BC, he became one of the key figures in 1st Century BC Roman politics.      He formed a political pact, known as the First Triumvirate, with Pompey and Crassus.      After successful military campaigns against the Gauls he invaded Britain, where he was eventually forced into retreat.      He defeated Pompey in a civil war and declared himself dictator, but was famously assassinated by Brutus, Cassius and other senators in 44BC.      His adopted son Octavian became Augustus, the first Roman Emperor.      Image caption Julius Caesar's invasion of Britain came almost 100 years before Claudius's successful conquest in AD43      Pottery found at the site was consistent with the 54BC arrival date and the team also found iron weapons, including a Roman javelin.      Archaeologist Dr Andrew Fitzpatrick said descriptions from Caesar's account of the invasion - which describes him leading a force of about 800 ships, 20,000 soldiers and 2,000 cavalry - suggested it was the correct landing site.      \\"The presence of cliffs, the existence of a large open bay, and the presence of higher ground nearby, are consistent with the 54BC landing having been in Pegwell Bay,\\" he said.      \\"It's a big force, and you need a big landing place, because simply to land that number of vessels you need a big front.      \\"We think that the location of the site fits very closely with what Julius Caesar gives in a series of clues - he doesn't tell us in detail, but he gives some snippets, and by piecing those snippets together we think it fits very well.\\"      Dr Fitzpatrick said the low-lying, coastal nature of the site was \\"defending the coast rather than looking inland\\", which led them to believe it could be Caesar's base.      Image copyright University of Leicester Image caption The defensive ditch is about two metres deep      Prof Colin Haselgrove, who led the investigation, said it was likely treaties set up in the wake of Caesar's invasion made it easier for the Romans to conquer parts of Britain almost 100 years later.      He said: \\"The conquest of south-east England seems to have been rapid, probably because the kings in the region were already allied to Rome.      \\"This was the beginning of the permanent Roman occupation of Britain, which included Wales and some of Scotland and lasted for almost 400 years.\\"      The findings will be explored further as part of Digging For Britain, on BBC Four at 21:00 GMT and afterwards on BBC iPlayer. ||||| The first Roman invasion of Britain by Julius Caesar in 55BC is a historical fact, with vivid accounts passed down by Tacitus, Cicero and Caesar himself.      Yet, despite a huge landing force of legionaries from 800 ships, no archaeological evidence for the attack or any physical remains of encampments have ever been found.      But now a chance excavation carried out ahead of a road building project in Kent has uncovered what is thought to be the first solid proof for the invasion.      Archaeologists from the University of Leicester and Kent County Council have found a defensive ditch and javelin spear at Ebbsfleet, a hamlet on the Isle of Thanet.      The shape of the ditch at Ebbsfleet, is similar to Roman defences at Alésia in France, where a decisive battle in the Gallic War took place in 52 BC.      Experts also discovered that nearby Pegwell Bay is one of the only bays in the vicinity which could have provided harbour for such a huge fleet of ships. And its topography echoes Caesar’s own observations of the landing site.      Dr Andrew Fitzpatrick, Research Associate from the University of Leicester’s School of Archaeology and Ancient History said: “Caesar describes how the ships were left at anchor at an even and open shore and how they were damaged by a great storm. This description is consistent with Pegwell Bay, which today is the largest bay on the east Kent coast and is open and flat. |||||","output":"Archaeological excavations in Pegwell Bay on the eastern tip of Kent may have revealed the ancient landing spot of Julius Caesar’s invasion of Britain in 54BC.

It's apparent that the sentence compares the crane's ability to raise a ship and a boat. Given the situation that the crane can raise a boat but not a ship, it is reasonable to conclude that this difference in ability must be due to a divergence in the weights or sizes of the two vessels. Option i says, \\"the ship was heavy for its size.\\" This completes the sentence in a way that provides an explanation for why the crane could not raise the ship - it was too heavy relative to its size.  Option ii says, \\"the boat was heavy for its size.\\" This option, while it could be a valid detail in some cases, does not make logical sense in this context. The sentence states that the crane could, indeed, raise the boat. As such, the boat being heavy for its size does not provide a valid explanation for the crane's ability to raise the boat but inability to raise the ship. So based on this analysis, the sentence should end with option i: \\"The crane could not raise the ship, but could bring up the boat, as the ship was heavy for its size.\\" This option provides a logical and coherent reason for the crane's inability to raise the ship but ability to raise the boat, showing that the task is rooted in the comparative weights and capacities involved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Today, we are going to learn about two different types of households and find out which one is smaller in number.  A \\"household\\" is a term we use to talk about the people who live in the same house or place together. There are many ways a household can be made. Some are made up of families, or friends, or people who just happen to live together. Today, we will look at two specific types of households: households with married couples living together and households made up of individuals living alone. First, let's talk about married couples living together. This is when a husband (a man) and wife (a woman) who are married, live in the same house. They may also have children or other family members living with them. Married couple households used to be the most common type in the past. The second type is households made up of individuals living alone. This means a person lives by themselves in a house and doesn't share it with anyone else. These individuals might be single adults who are not married, divorced, or older people who might have lost their partner.  Now, let's see which type of household group is smaller. Over time, the number of individuals living alone has grown, while the number of married couples living together has gone down. This is because people are choosing to live alone or waiting longer to get married. However, there are still more households of married couples living together than households made up of individuals living alone.  In conclusion, households made up of individuals living alone are a smaller group when compared to married couples living together. Although the number of people living alone is increasing, married couple households are still more common.

I am a big fan of the Spaghetti Western Genre, and I usually also like most of the cheaply made ones. Infamous Director Demofilo Fidani, however, is rightly known for some of the cheapest, trashiest, and, well, worst contributions to the genre. The plots of Fidani's movies were usually very weak, and since his talent was quite limited, he usually tried to sell the movies by adding famous Spaghetti Western names like \\"Django\\" of \\"Sartana\\" to the titles. I the particular case of \\"Giù La Testa... Hombre\\" of 1971 he just took the title of Sergio Leone's \\"Giù La Testa\\" (aka. \\"Duck You Sucker\\") and added 'Hombre'. The movie can be found under various titles (\\"Fistful Of Death\\", \\"Western Story\\"...), I personally bought it under the name \\"Adios Companeros\\", which this movie shares with another Fidani film with almost the same cast, \\"Per Una Bara Piena Di Dollari\\", which is also entitled \\"Adios Companeros\\" in the German language version. The plot is rather weak, it basically follows a guy named Macho Callaghan (Jeff Cameron) and his involvement with two rivaling outlaw gangs lead by Butch Cassidy (Jack Betts) and Ironhead (Gordon Mitchell). The leading performance by Jeff Cameron is, kindly stated, not very convincing. Neither did I find Jack Betts very good as 'Butch Cassidy'. B-movie legend Gordon Mitchell, however, is always worth a try, and although he probably wasn't a very good actor, I always found his performances in the Spaghetti Westerns quite funny and original, and he actually saved some of Fidani's movies (such as the rather crappy \\"Django And Sartana... Showdown in the West\\"). There is one very funny and original thing about \\"Giù La Testa... Hombre\\" - the great Klaus Kinski is playing a priest! I could have imagined Kinski in any role, but before seeing this movie I would never have guessed that anybody would cast him as a priest. Kinski is, once again, great, although he has only little screen time, and one scene, where he breaks up a fight, is probably the only good scene in this. One more interesting thing about this film is that the legendary director and king of sleaze Joe D'Amato did the cinematography. \\"Giù La Testa... Hombre\\" is a cheap, crappy film, but nevertheless, it has some funny moments. Being a Spaghetti Western enthusiast, I found it fun to watch, but if you're not, never mind this movie, or watch it only for the purpose of seeing Kinski play a priest. 3/10 Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie (see options below)?

She loves to trick the popular kids at school and her younger brother Max (Alex Winzenread). On the way to a library, Cassie finds a mysterious Halloween store in an alley and goes inside. The store owner (Tobin Bell) insists on selling her an old book titled The Evil Thing, which contains a warning not to read it aloud or think about its monster called \\"The Evil Thing\\", a two-headed creature that sucks blood while the other head eats meat. That night, Cassie ignores the warning in the book and reads it to Max as revenge for him unplugging her computer in the middle of a report she was writing. Priscilla Wright (Brittany Curran), a school bully who stole The Evil Thing from Cassie's bag in school, films her jumping in fear, after using a CD player to play monster sounds outside in order to make the monster appear to have come to life. After Cassie's parents leave for a Halloween party and later that night, The Evil Thing is brought to life by Max's thoughts, and captures him, Priscilla and a Papa John's Pizza delivery man.

Answer the following question: Process: - Dirty dishes are rinsed - Placed into the dishwasher - A detergent is added to the detergent dispenser - The dishwasher is closed - The power is turned on - In about 1.5-2 hours, the dishes are clean -   Question: suppose there is less detergent available happens, how will it affect more detergent is needed to clean the dishes.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If there is less detergent available than needed for a dishwasher cycle, it might lead to a reduced cleaning performance for the dishes. The dishwasher relies on a sufficient amount of detergent to break down and remove food particles, grease, and grime from the surfaces of the dishes. When there is a lack of detergent, the dishwasher may be less efficient in removing these residues, which could result in dishes not being as clean as they should be. The perturbation of having less detergent available does have an effect on the second effect mentioned, which is the need for more detergent to clean the dishes properly. With less detergent available for effective cleaning, it is likely that the dishes would require either an additional cycle with more detergent, manual washing, or the need to purchase and use more detergent for future dishwasher cycles. In conclusion, the effect of having less detergent available would lead to needing more detergent to achieve the desired level of cleanliness for the dishes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: how does the e coli bacteria cause death? Would \\"Cells are able to survive outside the body for a limited amount of time, which makes them ideal indicator organisms to test environmental samples for fecal contamination .\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"The E. coli bacteria can cause death primarily through the production of Shiga toxins, which are harmful to human cells. These toxins can damage the lining of the intestines and lead to severe diarrhea and complications like Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS), a condition that affects kidney function and may result in acute kidney failure. In some cases, these complications can be fatal, particularly in young children, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems. The statement \\"Cells are able to survive outside the body for a limited amount of time, which makes them ideal indicator organisms to test environmental samples for fecal contamination\\" is not directly related to how E. coli causes death. It is, however, a reasonable explanation for the use of E. coli bacteria as an indicator of fecal contamination in environmental samples, since the presence of E. coli can indicate the possible presence of harmful pathogens. While E. coli can be dangerous when ingested, the statement does not explain the mechanism by which it can cause death."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article:","output":"Title: Brittany Maynard's Fight for Death with Dignity: A Lesson in Courage and Choice Introduction: Brittany Maynard, a young woman diagnosed with Stage 4 glioblastoma earlier this year, has become a symbol of the right to die movement. Given just six months to live, Maynard and her husband, Dan Diaz, made the difficult decision to move from San Francisco to Oregon, one of the few states in the United States with death-with-dignity laws. In the face of her own mortality, Maynard bravely embarked on a mission to lobby lawmakers in other states to pass legislation allowing individuals to choose how they want to die. 1. The Diagnosis and Decision to Move: Upon receiving her terminal diagnosis of Stage 4 glioblastoma, Brittany Maynard knew her time was limited. She and her husband researched states with death-with-dignity laws, finally setting on Oregon as their new home. This move represented their commitment to giving Brittany the opportunity to pass away on her own terms, surrounded by her loved ones in a comfortable and familiar environment. 2. Advocacy for Death with Dignity: Brittany Maynard's advocacy for death with dignity has been nothing short of inspiring. Despite her failing health, she has been vocal in her fight for legislation supporting the right to die. By raising awareness about this issue, Maynard has given a voice to many who may face a similar situation in the future. Her efforts have highlighted the importance of autonomy in an individual's decision-making process, specifically regarding how they choose to die. 3. Choosing a Date for the End of Life: As a demonstration of her unwavering commitment to her beliefs, Brittany Maynard has determined the date on which she will end her life-November 1, a day after her husband's birthday. This date was chosen to allow Maynard to share one final birthday with her husband and to offer her loved ones a sense of closure. Conclusion: Brittany Maynard's battle with glioblastoma and her advocacy for death-with-dignity laws have played a crucial role in shedding light on the right to die movement. Her strength, determination, and courage serve as a powerful testament to the human spirit. As the conversation surrounding death with dignity continues to evolve, Maynard's legacy will remain an enduring reminder of the importance of choice and autonomy in end-of-life decisions."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Heavy bombing of the factory in September 1940 destroyed it as well as homes in the vicinity, killing civilians and workers. World War II hit Southampton particularly hard because of its strategic importance as a major commercial port and industrial area. Prior to the Invasion of Europe, components for a Mulberry harbour were built here. After D-Day, Southampton docks handled military cargo to help keep the Allied forces supplied, making it a key target of Luftwaffe bombing raids until late 1944.

Here is an email: Reviewed by Mark Williams, SVP Risk Management, Citizens Power  The long awaited second edition of Managing Energy Price Risk has finally arrived. It has been four years since the first edition was published. During this hiatus, a lot has happened as risk management within the rapidly expanding energy industry has come of age as a respected discipline. The second edition is a rich compilation of papers by a surprisingly representative group of industry leaders, practitioners and academics. The books strength is that it reinforces the fact that risk management principles initially applied to a narrow band of energy commodities can and should be applied across a wide array of energy commodities including electricity. As expected the book does a solid job in capturing an international perspective on the various challenges, which are not isolated to any one continent but are global in scope. It includes a lengthy introduction that effectively frames risk management progress, advancements and innovations that started in the oil markets in the 1970's and migrated to the natural gas and most recently expanding to the electricity industry. Managing Energy Price Risk is comprised of 15 chapters, all of which include an introduction, which minimises the disjointedness that you may expect from a book written by a large number of authors. Other improvements in this second edition include expanded graphics, highlighted panels, detailed appendices and a separate glossary, which provides the reader with additional reference material. In particular the chapter on energy options written by Michael Hampton is a useful primer and provides the reader with a concise explanation of option theory, pricing, basis risk, delta hedging as well as practical guidelines for distinguishing between hedging and pure speculation. For the more advanced reader, the chapter on Energy Exotic Options, written by Vince Kaminski, Stinson Gibner and Krishnarao Pinnamaneni is particularly strong as it outlines the challenges associated with the exotics and effectively documents the latest methods used by leading practitioners in pricing such instruments. Additionally, the chapter on Accounting for Derivative Contracts in the Energy Environment by three consultants from Arthur Anderson, is a well written summary which addresses the numerous tax related issues including a timely discussion on the US Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement 133 (see EPRM October 1999, page 22). Having this tax information housed in one concise chapter is of great value. The second edition however is not without flaws. In particular, it would have been useful to have more information on the current challenges risk managers are confronted with in the power industry including latest advancements in volatility and correlation estimation techniques. Additional attention could have also been placed on the shortcomings of the current market structure and methods in finding and applying appropriate hedging strategies and instruments. In the fledgling power market, this continues to be one of the primary challenges. In summary, this second edition of Managing Energy Price Risk builds upon the sentinel work laid out in the prior edition and is a valuable reference book for the new recruit or seasoned veteran. It is a welcome edition to any risk management library.

In order to provide a detailed explanation for this statement, it is important to understand the context and the objectives behind the statement. The reference to \\"union\\" may pertain to the European Union, or any other form of alliance or organization that aims to increase its presence and impact on a global scale. In general, unions or organizations are formed to strengthen the bond and collaboration between its members, and to work collectively toward common goals and interests. In this case, the primary goal is to enhance the visibility and effectiveness of the union worldwide. Firstly, to improve the visibility of the union globally, it is essential to invest in strategic communication and public diplomacy efforts. This involves raising awareness about the union's goals, values, and achievements, and showcasing its projects and success stories. Consistent and transparent messaging through various channels such as social media, websites, and press releases will contribute to raising the union's public profile and attracting international interest. Engaging with key stakeholders, including policymakers, business leaders, media, and the general public, will further strengthen the union's position and credibility in the international community. Secondly, increasing the union's effectiveness on the global stage requires solid cooperation and coordination among its member states. This can be achieved by developing common policies and frameworks, investing in joint projects, and sharing best practices and expertise. Working as a collective enables the union to pool its resources, in terms of knowledge, experience, finances, and technical capabilities, to tackle global challenges more efficiently. By demonstrating how the union's activities generate positive outcomes and contribute to the common good of its members and the world at large, the union can prove its worth and relevance in the international arena. Furthermore, to enhance the union's effectiveness, it is crucial to establish strong networks and partnerships with other countries, international organizations, and regional blocs. Global issues, such as climate change, economic crises, or large-scale conflicts, require collaborative efforts and multilateral approaches. By actively participating in international forums and negotiations, and by pursuing joint initiatives with other actors, the union will not only gradually increase its influence and reach but also showcase its commitment to finding global solutions to shared challenges. Additionally, the union should actively promote innovation and research within its member states, as well as invest in capacity-building and transfer of technology between its members. This will lead to increased competitiveness and sustainable growth, enabling the union to become a more prominent player on the global stage. Encouraging cooperation in education, science, and technology will help the union create a favorable environment for innovation, and will attract talent and investment from around the world. In conclusion, improving the visibility and effectiveness of the union in the current global landscape can be achieved through various means, including strategic communication and public diplomacy, coordinated efforts and collaboration between member states, active participation in international affairs, and fostering innovation and research.

Here is a goal: Personalize words on an m&m candy How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of personalizing words on an M&M candy, you'll need to follow a series of steps, involving designing the personalized M&M, selecting the right tools and supplies, and applying the design onto the M&M candies. Here is a detailed, step-by-step guide on how to achieve this goal: 1. Design the personalized message: Start by coming up with a short message or design that you want to personalize the M&M candy with. Keep in mind that M&M candies have a very small surface area, so it's best to choose a message or design that is simple, clear, and made up of a few letters or symbols. 2. Choose an M&M candy color: Select the base color of M&M candies that you wish to personalize. The contrast between the candy color and the color of the design will be significant for legibility, so keep that in mind while selecting the candy color. 3. Select the right tools: For personalizing the M&M candies with your design, you will need some specialized tools to imprint or apply the design onto the candy. Some popular methods include using edible ink pens, food-grade color markers, or edible inkjet printers. Each tool has its advantages and limitations, so choose the one that you feel most comfortable working with and that best suits your design or message requirements. 4. Practice your design: If you're using an edible ink pen or food-grade color markers, practice drawing or writing your design on a piece of paper to improve your technique and ensure the final result looks neat and legible. 5. Preparing the M&Ms for personalization: Lay out your M&M candies on a clean, flat surface with plenty of space between each piece. This will prevent smudging or overlapping of designs. 6. Apply the design: Once you are ready, carefully apply your design to each M&M candy using the chosen tool. If you're using an edible ink pen or food-grade color marker, work slowly and steadily to ensure accuracy and legibility. Be extra cautious if you are personalizing an M&M with an intricate design. If you are using an edible inkjet printer, follow the manufacturer's instructions for on how to load the M&M candies, set up the design, and print the message. 7. Allow the ink to dry: After completing the application of your personalized message or design, allow the ink to dry for a few minutes to prevent smudging or ink transfer. 8. Storage and presentation: Once the personalized M&M candies are dry, store them in an airtight container to preserve freshness. If you want to showcase your personalized M&Ms, you may display them in a decorative bowl or jar, or even create custom packaging to present them in as a unique and thoughtful gift. 9. Enjoy your personalized M&M candies: Share and enjoy your personalized M&M candies with friends, family, or at special events. They are sure to stand out and impress your guests with the extra effort you put into customizing these delicious treats. By following these steps, you will be able to successfully personalize M&M candies with your own unique message or design, adding a special touch to an already popular and well-loved treat."},{"instruction":"Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Voters in Pennsylvania head to the polls Tuesday in a special congressional election with national implications for President Donald Trump and opposition Democrats. The election is taking place in a congressional district that Trump won by 19 points in 2016, but where Democrats now hope for an upset that could be a preview of the midterm congressional elections in November. The race pits Democrat Conor Lamb against Republican Rick Saccone. Saccone got some high-profile help on Saturday when Trump spoke on his behalf at a rally in Moon Township, Pennsylvania. \\"We need him. We need Republicans. We need the votes. Otherwise, they are going to take away your tax cuts. They are going to take away your Second Amendment rights,\\" Trump warned the crowd. Though Trump easily won the district in 2016, Lamb appears to be competitive in part because he is a moderate-to-conservative Democrat who personally opposes abortion and any new gun control measures. Lamb is hoping to pull off an upset with help from former Vice President Joe Biden. \\"Passion and commitment rules in politics. Passion and commitment generates grass-roots support,\\" Biden told a recent Lamb rally. Republicans have poured money into the race, including millions of dollars in television advertisements in the final days before the election. Trump is trying to help Republicans avoid another setback on the way to the November midterm elections, where Democrats are favored to make gains. In making his pitch to voters this election year, the president remains focused on his tax cut bill, new tariffs on steel and aluminum, and a diplomatic opening to North Korea.  But Trump remains stuck at about 40 percent approval in the polls, historically low for a second-year president, and a potential drag for Republican candidates in November. \\"He's doing nothing to expand his base,\\" said Jim Kessler of Third Way, a centrist Democrat advocacy group. \\"And also, political damage is kind of like sunburn. You don't really notice it as it is happening. And later in the day you... Question: Who is the candidate who a moderate to conservative Democrat who opposed abortion and new gun control measures?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the answer to this question? what is a good score on the miller analogies test?","output":"A good score on the Miller Analogies Test (MAT) depends on the requirements of the specific graduate program or institution you are considering, as well as how your score compares to those of other test-takers in the same pool. The MAT is a standardized test commonly used for graduate school admissions in the United States. It measures a candidate's ability to understand complex relationships and similarities through the use of analogies. The MAT consists of 120 analogy-based questions, which are divided into four categories: 1. Semantic: These questions test vocabulary knowledge and general reasoning abilities. 2. Analytic: These questions require understanding relationships among terms and how these relationships apply to novel situations. 3. Classification: These questions test a candidate's ability to group items based on shared properties. 4. Syntactic: These questions examine understanding of word order and patterns in sentences. From these 120 questions, only 100 items contribute to the examinee's final score. The other 20 items are experimental and are used to evaluate their suitability for future test editions. Test-takers have 60 minutes to complete the MAT. MAT scores are reported as both a raw score and a scaled score, which range from 200 to 600. The raw score is simply the number of questions answered correctly, while the scaled score is adjusted to account for differences in difficulty between different test editions. The test developer, Pearson, also provides a percentile rank for the scaled scores, which show the percentage of test-takers scoring below a given score. Now, to determine what a \\"good\\" score is, consider the following factors: 1. Graduate program requirements: Some graduate programs have minimum MAT score requirements, while others provide score ranges for their typical successful applicants. To identify what may be considered a good score for the program you are interested in, research the program's website or contact their admissions office. 2. Comparisons to other test-takers: Percentile ranks provide a useful comparison to understand how your score compares to others. A higher percentile rank indicates better performance as compared to other test-takers. Generally, a percentile rank of 50 or above would indicate that you scored higher than half of the test-takers, while a rank above 70 or 80 would place you in the top 30% or 20%, respectively. 3. Personal goals: Consider your own academic background and the competitiveness of the programs you are applying to when setting a personal target MAT score. To provide a general idea, examinees who score around 400 or above are typically considered to have performed well on the MAT. However, highly competitive graduate programs may expect scores closer to 500 or even higher to stand out in the applicant pool. In conclusion, a good score on the Miller Analogies Test depends on several factors, including the requirements of the graduate program you are interested in, how your score compares to other test-takers, and your personal goals. To increase your chances of admission, strive for a score significantly above the minimum required or the average score range for your desired program."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What is the name of the person that is made into a statue in the grotto? is inside the article: With the garden project well in hand, Ammanati turned his attentions to creating a large courtyard immediately behind the principal façade, to link the palazzo to its new garden. This courtyard has heavy-banded channelled rustication that has been widely copied, notably for the Parisian palais of Maria de' Medici, the Luxembourg. In the principal façade Ammanati also created the finestre inginocchiate (\\"kneeling\\" windows, in reference to their imagined resemblance to a prie-dieu, a device of Michelangelo's), replacing the entrance bays at each end. During the years 1558–70, Ammanati created a monumental staircase to lead with more pomp to the piano nobile, and he extended the wings on the garden front that embraced a courtyard excavated into the steeply sloping hillside at the same level as the piazza in front, from which it was visible through the central arch of the basement.  On the garden side of the courtyard Amannati constructed a grotto, called the \\"grotto of Moses\\" on account of the porphyry statue that inhabits it. On the terrace above it, level with the piano nobile windows, Ammanati constructed a fountain centered on the axis; it was later replaced by the Fontana del Carciofo (\\"Fountain of the Artichoke\\"), designed by Giambologna's former assistant, Francesco Susini, and completed in 1641.In 1616, a competition was held to design extensions to the principal urban façade by three bays at either end. Giulio Parigi won the commission; work on the north side began in 1618, and on the south side in 1631 by Alfonso Parigi.  During the 18th century, two perpendicular wings were constructed by the architect Giuseppe Ruggeri to enhance and stress the widening of via Romana, which creates a piazza centered on the façade, the prototype of the cour d'honneur that was copied in France.

Alexander's body was laid in a gold anthropoid sarcophagus that was filled with honey, which was in turn placed in a gold casket. According to Aelian, a seer called Aristander foretold that the land where Alexander was laid to rest \\"would be happy and unvanquishable forever\\". Perhaps more likely, the successors may have seen possession of the body as a symbol of legitimacy, since burying the prior king was a royal prerogative. While Alexander's funeral cortege was on its way to Macedon, Ptolemy seized it and took it temporarily to Memphis. His successor, Ptolemy II Philadelphus, transferred the sarcophagus to Alexandria, where it remained until at least late Antiquity. Ptolemy IX Lathyros, one of Ptolemy's final successors, replaced Alexander's sarcophagus with a glass one so he could convert the original to coinage. The recent discovery of an enormous tomb in northern Greece, at Amphipolis, dating from the time of Alexander the Great has given rise to speculation that its original intent was to be the burial place of Alexander. This would fit with the intended destination of Alexander's funeral cortege. Pompey, Julius Caesar and Augustus all visited the tomb in Alexandria, where Augustus, allegedly, accidentally knocked the nose off. Caligula was said to have taken Alexander's breastplate from the tomb for his own use. Around AD 200, Emperor Septimius Severus closed Alexander's tomb to the public. His son and successor, Caracalla, a great admirer, visited the tomb during his own reign. After this, details on the fate of the tomb are hazy. The so-called \\"Alexander Sarcophagus\\", discovered near Sidon and now in the Istanbul Archaeology Museum, is so named not because it was thought to have contained Alexander's remains, but because its bas-reliefs depict Alexander and his companions fighting the Persians and hunting. It was originally thought to have been the sarcophagus of Abdalonymus (died 311 BC), the king of Sidon appointed by Alexander immediately following the battle of Issus in 331. However, more recently, it has been suggested that it may date from earlier than Abdalonymus' death.

Answer the following question: Given the below context:  Other scholar-bureaucrats were wary of Wang's heterodoxy, the increasing number of his disciples while he was still in office, and his overall socially rebellious message. To curb his influence, he was often sent out to deal with military affairs and rebellions far away from the capital. Yet his ideas penetrated mainstream Chinese thought and spurred new interest in Taoism and Buddhism. Furthermore, people began to question the validity of the social hierarchy and the idea that the scholar should be above the farmer. Wang Yangming's disciple and salt-mine worker Wang Gen gave lectures to commoners about pursuing education to improve their lives, while his follower He Xinyin (何心隱) challenged the elevation and emphasis of the family in Chinese society. His contemporary Li Zhi even taught that women were the intellectual equals of men and should be given a better education; both Li and He eventually died in prison, jailed on charges of spreading \\"dangerous ideas\\". Yet these \\"dangerous ideas\\" of educating women had long been embraced by some mothers and by courtesans who were as literate and skillful in calligraphy, painting, and poetry as their male guests.The liberal views of Wang Yangming were opposed by the Censorate and by the Donglin Academy, re-established in 1604. These conservatives wanted a revival of orthodox Confucian ethics. Conservatives such as Gu Xiancheng (1550–1612) argued against Wang's idea of innate moral knowledge, stating that this was simply a legitimization for unscrupulous behavior such as greedy pursuits and personal gain. These two strands of Confucian thought, hardened by Chinese scholars' notions of obligation towards their mentors, developed into pervasive factionalism among the ministers of state, who used any opportunity to impeach members of the other faction from court.

Draw the graph point for each pair. Remove the imaginary lines.","output":"Title: How to Accurately Plot and Draw Graphs for a Given Function: Step-by-Step Guide Introduction Many fields of study, including mathematics, engineering, and natural sciences, require the ability to create accurate graphs to analyze and visualize the behavior of functions. This article will guide you through a step-by-step process to determine, plot, and draw graphs for a given function. Step 1: Determine the function First, you must determine the function you want to graph. Functions can be a simple linear equation such as y = x + 3, or more complex equations like quadratic, exponential, or logarithmic functions. Ensure you have a clear understanding of the function and its properties before moving on to the next step. Step 2: Draw two lines in a + shape on a piece of paper Draw two lines in a \\"+\\" shape on a piece of paper. These lines will represent the x-axis (horizontal line) and y-axis (vertical line) of the coordinate plane, with the point where the two lines intersect being the origin (0, 0). Make sure the lines are long enough to accommodate the range of x and y values you'll be plotting. Step 3: Number your graph Label the horizontal line with the appropriate x values, and the vertical line with the appropriate y values. Be consistent with the scale you use, ensuring equal intervals between the numbers on both axes. This will help you plot the points accurately and maintain the correct proportions in your graph. Include negative values if needed, extending to the left and downwards from the origin. Step 4: Calculate a y value for 2-3 x values Choose 2-3 x values within the range of your graph, and calculate the corresponding y values using the function you determined in step 1. For example, if the function is y = x + 3, and the x value is 2, the calculated y value would be 5 (since 2 + 3 = 5). Step 5: Draw the graph point for each pair Now, plot the points on the coordinate plane using the calculated x and y pairs. Ensure each point is placed accurately in relation to the labeled axes. If your function is continuous (such as a linear, quadratic, or exponential function), you can draw a smooth curve or line connecting the points.  Step 6: Remove the imaginary lines Once you've plotted the points and connected them with the appropriate curve or line, you can remove any additional or unnecessary lines that were used as guidelines during the plotting process. This will ensure that the final graph is clean, accurate, and easy to read. Conclusion Understanding how to accurately plot and draw graphs is an essential skill in many different fields. By following this step-by-step guide, you can confidently and accurately create graphs for any given function, and become a more proficient problem solver within your field of study."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How do you do this: freeze soup","output":"Freezing soup is an excellent way to preserve leftovers or meal prep for future consumption. The process helps maintain the soup’s flavor, texture, and nutritional value. Here’s a detailed guide on how to freeze soup properly: 1. Allow the soup to cool: Before freezing, give the soup some time to cool down to room temperature. This helps prevent the growth of bacteria and ensures that the soup doesn't raise the temperature of your freezer, which could affect other foods. To speed up the cooling process, you can place the pot in an ice bath or stir the soup occasionally to release heat. 2. Choose the right containers: Once the soup has cooled, select appropriate containers or freezer-safe bags for storage. Opt for BPA-free plastic containers with airtight lids, glass containers with freezer-safe labels, or heavy-duty resealable plastic bags specifically designed for freezing. Make sure the containers are clean and free from any residual odors. 3. Leave space for expansion: Soup tends to expand when freezing, so it's crucial to leave some headspace in the container to prevent it from cracking or distortion. For containers, leave about an inch of space from the top, whereas for freezer bags, try to avoid filling them to the brim. 4. Separate into portion sizes: Freezing the soup in smaller, individual portion sizes will not only save space in your freezer but also make it easier to reheat the exact amount you need for a meal. This step is particularly helpful for avoiding waste and multiple freeze-thaw cycles that can degrade the soup's quality. 5. Label and date: To keep track of your soup's freshness and make it easy to identify in the freezer, use a permanent marker to label each container or freezer bag with the contents and the date it was made. Soups can generally be kept frozen for up to 2-3 months, though some soups, such as those with delicate vegetables or seafood, are best consumed within a month. 6. Remove air and seal: When using freezer bags, it's important to remove as much air as possible before sealing them securely. The lack of oxygen will help prevent freezer burn and preserve the soup's flavor better. Double-check the lids on containers to ensure a tight, leak-proof seal. 7. Store flat and stack: For freezer bags, lay them flat on a baking sheet or tray to freeze them in a uniform shape, making them easier to stack once they're frozen. This will help you optimize the storage space in your freezer and keep it organized. 8. Freeze: Place the containers or bags in the freezer, ensuring they are not covered or surrounded by other items that could affect their freezing process. Allow the soup to freeze completely, which may take several hours or overnight, depending on the size of the portions. 9. Reorganize the freezer: Once the soup has fully frozen, you can stack the containers or bags strategically in your freezer to save space while keeping your freezer organized. When you’re ready to enjoy your frozen soup, allow it to thaw in the refrigerator for several hours or overnight, or reheat it directly from the freezer using a microwave, stovetop, or oven. It’s always recommended to reheat the soup thoroughly to ensure it’s safe to eat and has reached 165°F (74°C) before consuming. Keep in mind that certain delicate ingredients like pasta, rice, and some vegetables might not hold up well during the freezing and thawing process. If possible, you can freeze these components separately or add them to the soup only after the base has been reheated."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

They recline in a silence broken only by whispers and indistinguishable noises. The young man is the son (Alexei Ananishnov) who is taking care of his exhausted sick mother (Gudrun Geyer). Her illness is undefined and from time to time causes her great pain as she gasps for air. Her son combs her hair, feeds her, covers her with a coat, and takes her in his arms. She is totally dependent on him as he himself was once totally dependent on her. As the film progresses, the son carries his mother on a long journey from her sickbed to her deathbed. It is a circular motion which travels a long walk through a dreamlike landscape in the countryside, along winding dirt roads. At each of their brief stops on the journey is a moment of contemplation, caresses, and tender murmurs. These soft murmurs tell of the mother's love for her son when she was nurturing him and of the son's love for his mother as he opens for her the mysterious path to her death.

Mill goes to the theater, pretending to recognize Kahane in the lobby after the film, and offers him a scriptwriting deal, hoping this will stop the threats. The two go to a nearby bar and have some drinks. Kahane gets intoxicated and rebuffs Mills offer; he calls Mill a liar, pointing out that he knows Mill didn't really go to the theater to see 'The Bicycle Thief' because Kahane saw Mill wander in late and only catch the last five minutes of it, and denies responsibility for sending Mill the postcards.

Bounded by the South China Sea on the west, the Philippine Sea on the east and the Celebes Sea on the southwest, the Philippines shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north, Vietnam to the west, Palau to the east and Malaysia and Indonesia to the south.  - Indonesia (or ; Indonesian: ), officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a unitary sovereign state and transcontinental country located mainly in Southeast Asia with some territories in Oceania. Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans, it is the world's largest island country, with more than seventeen thousand islands. At , Indonesia is the world's 14th-largest country in terms of land area and world's 7th-largest country in terms of combined sea and land area. It has an estimated population of over 260 million people and is the world's fourth most populous country, the most populous Austronesian nation, as well as the most populous Muslim-majority country. The world's most populous island of Java contains more than half of the country's population.  - Philippine cuisine (Filipino: \\"Lutuing Pilipino\\" or \\"Pagkaing Pilipino\\") consists of the food, preparation methods, and eating customs found in the Philippines. The style of cooking and the food associated with it have evolved over many centuries from their Austronesian origins to a mixed cuisine of Malay-Indonesian, Indian, Japanese, Chinese, Spanish, and American, in line with the major waves of influence that had enriched the cultures of the archipelago, as well as others adapted to indigenous ingredients and the local palate.  - Sinigang is a Filipino soup or stew characterized by its sour and savoury taste most often associated with tamarind ( Filipino : sampalok ) . It is one of the more popular viands in Philippine cuisine , and is related to the Malaysian dish singgang . While present nationwide , sinigang is seen to be culturally Tagalog in origin , thus the versions found in the Visayas and Mindanao may differ in taste ( mainly ginger is an additional ingredient ) . Fish sauce is a common condiment for the stew .  - In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. In looser senses, the taller palms, the tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. The tallest known tree, a coast redwood named Hyperion, stands high. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world.  - The Fabaceae, Leguminosae or Papilionaceae, commonly known as the legume, pea, or bean family, are a large and economically important family of flowering plants. It includes trees, shrubs, and perennial or annual herbaceous plants, which are easily recognized by their fruit (legume) and their compound, stipulated leaves. The family is widely distributed, and is the third-largest land plant family in terms of number of species, behind only the Orchidaceae and Asteraceae, with about 751 genera and some 19,000 known species . The five largest of the genera are \\"Astragalus\\" (over 3,000 species), \\"Acacia\\" (over 1000 species), \\"Indigofera\\" (around 700 species), \\"Crotalaria\\" (around 700 species) and \\"Mimosa\\" (around 500 species), which constitute about a quarter of all legume species. The ca. 19,000 known legume species amount to about 7% of flowering plant species. Fabaceae is the most common family found in tropical rainforests and in dry forests in the Americas and Africa.  - Gin is a spirit which derives its predominant flavour from juniper berries (\\"Juniperus communis\\"). From its earliest origins in the Middle Ages, gin has evolved from a herbal medicine to an object of commerce in the spirits industry. Gin was developed on the basis of the older jenever, and became popular in Great Britain (particularly in London) when William of Orange, leader of the Dutch Republic, occupied the English, Scottish, and Irish thrones with his wife Mary. Gin is one of the broadest categories of spirits, represented by products of various origins, styles, and flavour profiles that all revolve around juniper as a common ingredient.  - In biology, a monotypic taxon is a taxonomic group (taxon) that contains only one immediately subordinate taxon. Although the phrase appears to indicate that a taxon has a single type specimen (with no syntypes, lectotypes, or other types) and no heterotypic/junior synonyms, that is not the usage.  - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition.  - Tamarind (\\"Tamarindus indica\\") is a leguminous tree in the family Fabaceae indigenous to tropical Africa. The genus Tamarindus is a monotypic taxon, having only a single species.  - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.  - Although tropical Africa is most familiar in the West as depicted by its rain forests, this region of Africa is far more diverse. While the tropics are thought of as regions with warm to hot moist climates caused by latitude and the tropical rain belt, the geology of areas, particularly mountain chains, and geographical relation to continental and regional scale winds impact the overall parts of areas , also, making the tropics run from arid to humid in West Africa.

I have never been to this establishment but having been to Carnevino and having a WONDERFUL dinner I had expectations.   Enoteca is a bit more casual and low key than Carne and offers pastas, pizzas and a small variety of entrees.   Our group started with a selection of cheeses, Prosciutto di Parma and fried squash blossoms. Not being a cheese fan I passed on the cheese and sampled the prosciutto and blossoms. YUM! The Prosciutto was delicate, just a bit salty and a nice light beginning to the meal. The squash blossoms were filled with some sort of cheese mixture, lightly battered and deep fried. And though fried they were still very light and airy. DELISH! I've never had squash blossoms but this app made me a fan!   For dinner I had the the Marinated Chicken Paillard. WOW! What a serving! The dish \\"base\\" was a large slice of deep fried eggplant topped with ricotta cheese, three chicken breast pieces, spicy arugula and a light almost tangy green sauce. So Good and a very generous serving of food! I was able to finish the eggplant, arugula and two pieces of chicken, but left one last piece....just too full. I also have to mention the Braised Pork Shoulder which two members of our party ordered. I was told was delicious and literally fell apart it was so tender. They didn't even need a knife to slice the meat, it just pulled part with a fork! Good stuff.  For dessert we did a sampling of two gelatos and one sorbet. We had the chocolate gelato with hazelnuts, a black cherry gelato and a strawberry sorbet. All were the perfect ending to the meal. Cool, light, clean, refreshing and delicious!

Thomas Gainsborough painted some of Britain’s most recognisable landscapes as well as some of the 18th century's most famous aristocrats. So, the discovery of what could be the great artist’s paints has got art historians excited. The intriguing little pots were found at the artist's home and experts believe they were used by the master. The bladders of paint (pictured) were found at Gainsborough's former house in Sudbury in the mid-1960s during a clear-out, it is only now that experts are attempting to confirm their provenance. Before the invention of tubes made of lead or tin, painters carried bladders to store the paint that they would have made in their studio. The bladders were made from pig bladder - hence the name -  and tied at the top with strong twine to keep air out. This kept the paint fresh and workable. It is unusual for such a large collection of delicate bladders of paint to survive. The ‘bladders’ of paint spent hundreds of years gathering dust in the attic at the famous 18th century Suffolk-born painter’s former house. While they were found at the property in Sudbury in the mid-1960s during a clear-out, it is only now that experts are attempting to confirm their provenance. The paints were discovered just after the house was opened to the public as a museum and art gallery some 50 years ago. The 'bladders' of paint spent hundreds of years gathering dust in the attic at the famous 18th century Suffolk-born painter's former house (pictured) Thomas Gainsborough (self portrait left) painted some of Britain’s most recognisable landscapes and famous portraits of 18th century aristocrats, such as Anne, Countess of Chesterfield (right) Executive director Mark Bills intends to feature the historic paint bladders in an exhibition, but only after they have been examined by specialists. ‘We’ve commissioned the Hamilton Kerr Institute at Cambridge University - they have lots of experience in this area,’ Mr Bills said. ‘The paints will undergo a scientific test to date them and to see if it’s plausible that they’re Gainsborough’s.’ He said that the museum is undertaking the work now that it has the funding, but it already knows that the bladders are mid-18th Century and French. Some 19 pouches were discovered in the attic and Mr Bills said it is rare to find so many together. ‘It is possible that they were a present to someone in the family but to buy paints at that time wasn’t cheap - they would have been a good present,’ he said. ‘There are secrets yet to be revealed.’ The Suffolk-born painter's former house in Sudbury (pictured) now hosts exhibitions of his work and is a museum for fans of Gainsborough. Thomas Gainsborough was born in Sudbury, Suffolk in 1727 and became one of the country’s most celebrated landscape and portrait artists before dying in 1788 aged 61. He left home in 1740 to study art in London with William Hogarth. After marrying In 1746 Margaret Burr and fathering two daughters, he moved to Bath in 1759 where fashionable society patronised him, and he began exhibiting in London. In 1769, he became a founding member of the Royal Academy, but his relationship with the organisation was thorny and he sometimes withdrew his work from exhibition. Gainsborough moved to London in 1774, and painted portraits of the king and queen. He painted relatively simple landscapes and is credited (along with Richard Wilson) as the originator of the 18th century British landscape school. He painted quickly and his later pictures are characterised by a light palette and easy strokes. He preferred landscapes to portraits. His liking for landscapes is shown in the way he merged figures of the portraits with the scenes behind them. Gainsborough worked more from observations of nature and of human nature than from application of formal academic rules. The poetic sensibility of his paintings caused Constable to say, ‘On looking at them, we find tears in our eyes and know not what brings them.’ The paints (pictured) will undergo a scientific test to date them and to see if it's plausible that they¿re Gainsborough's. Once the tests have been completed and the paints returned to Sudbury they will become part of an exhibition next year and a conference about Gainsborough and contemporary artists. Even if it turns out that the bladders did not belong to the ‘son of Suffolk’ they will still be a valuable addition to the museum’s collection. 'To have 19 surviving is a very rare thing - They are really important,’ Mr Bills said. Once the scientific tests have been completed to establish the paints' former owner, they will become part of an exhibition next year and a conference about Gainsborough and contemporary artists. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"In the mid-1960s, 19 paint bladders were discovered in the attic of Thomas Gainsborough's former house in Sudbury, believed to have been used by the famous 18th-century British artist.

Here is a news article: Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn is done with .      In an interview with CNBC on Thursday, Icahn said he has unloaded all of his Apple shares, citing concern about the tech giant's challenges in China.      The 80-year-old investor said the stock is cheap and he still believes Apple is a \\"great company\\" and CEO Tim Cook is doing a \\"tremendous job.\\"      Yet his fears about China have prompted him to exit the stock. \\"China obviously could be a shadow for it,\\" he told CNBC, describing concerns about the government telling Apple what it can and can't do.      Icahn started chipping away at his Apple stake months ago, selling 700 million worth of shares in the fourth quarter of 2015. That still left him with some 46 million shares, equivalent to less than 1% of the company.      The investment has been a successful one for Icahn. He estimates that he's pocketed about 2 billion in profits and could return for more. \\"I hope to get back into [the stock] someday,\\" he said.      Since Icahn announced in a 2013 tweet he had taken a \\"large\\" position in the company after speaking with Tim Cook, he has been one of Apple's biggest fans. Last year, he said the company was worth more than 1 trillion, at a time when its market capitalization was 700 billion. He's routinely called the stock undervalued and misunderstood by the market and expressed hope that Apple would make an entrance into television and cars.      The stock was down nearly 2% following Icahn's comments, after falling 6% yesterday on ugly quarterly earnings.      Apple has struggled to sell more iPhones and on Tuesday reported its first quarterly sales drop in 13 years. Sales fell all over the world, but dropped an especially steep 26% in China.      Must Read: Little Black Book Of Billionaire Secrets ||||| Financial analysts say it's too early to worry about the falling sales in Apple's largest market after U.S. Apple executives said Tuesday that they remained committed to China and that its economy is steadier than many believe. The company also manufacturers in China. ||||| NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn said Thursday he had sold his entire stake in Apple Inc (AAPL.O), citing the risk of China’s influence on the stock.      Billionaire activist-investor Carl Icahn gives an interview on FOX Business Network's Neil Cavuto show in New York February 11, 2014. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid      Icahn, in an interview with cable television network CNBC, also said he was “still very cautious” on the U.S. stock market and there would be a “day of reckoning” unless there was some sort of fiscal stimulus.      Icahn had been a huge cheerleader of Apple, acquiring a stake in the company almost three years ago, repeatedly calling the investment a “no brainer.”      In an open letter to Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook in May 2015, Icahn had argued that shares of the iPhone maker were worth 240, about 90 percent more than they had been trading. At 240 a share, Apple’s market cap would be 1.4 trillion, Icahn asserted.      But Icahn, who owned 45.8 million Apple shares at the end of last year, said China’s economic slowdown and worries about how China could become more prohibitive in doing business triggered his decision to exit his position entirely.      “We no longer have a position in Apple. Tim Cook did a great job. I called him this morning to tell him that and he was a little sorry, obviously. But I told him it’s a great company,” Icahn said. “In Apple today as opposed to six months or a year ago, in this one, there’s no need for activism because I think they have a great management. But you worry a little bit, maybe more than a little, about China’s attitude.”      The Chinese government could “come in and make it very difficult for Apple to sell there ... You can do pretty much what you want there,” Icahn said. Earlier this month, China shut down Apple’s iTunes movies and iBooks stores within the country, following Beijing’s introduction of regulations in March imposing strict curbs on online publishing, particularly for foreign firms.      Asked when he might get back in, Icahn replied: “I don’t think it’s the price point. I think it’s my opinion about what is happening with China. I think the stock is very cheap on a multiple basis. China could be a shadow for it, and we have to look at that.”      Icahn, who suggested that he made roughly 2 billion off the Apple trade, said he was in Apple for about three years and “if you bought the stock then, you got a 48 percent to 50 percent total return. We obviously made a great deal of money, but it was no surprise that we got out of some in February.”      Apple shares came under further selling pressure during Icahn’s television interview, as did the Dow Jones industrials with Apple closing down over 3 percent at 94.83. The Dow ended down by 210 points.      Apple on Tuesday posted its first decline in iPhone sales as well as its first revenue drop in 13 years. The company’s sales fell by more than a quarter in China, its most important market after the United States, and it forecast another disappointing quarter for global revenues.      Apple shares have now declined more than 10 percent this week. ||||| Chinese customers of Apple's iTunes Movies and iBooks services are seeking refunds on their purchases amid reports that the features have been suspended at the behest of government authorities.            Apple has not issued any statement to customers in China about the status of the services, but many users report that they have been unable to connect to the movie service and iBooks since April 15.            A Beijing-based Apple spokeswoman said: \\"We hope to make books and movies available again to our customers in China as soon as possible,\\" but she would not elaborate on why the services were unavailable.            The Chinese government has not issued any statement on the matter. However, the New York Times, citing two anonymous sources, said the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television had ordered the services offline, though it was unclear why.            Apple's App Store revenue has surged in China in the last year, overtaking Japan as the world's No. 2 market for the service, according to App Annie.            Apple technical assistance and account service representatives, reached by phone in China, said they had received no official notice from the company that the services had been blocked or shut down. They offered to arrange refunds on purchased content.            \\"The iTunes Store's movie service is turned off,\\" one customer wrote on the Twitter-like service Sina Weibo. \\"I spent 88 kuai [about 13.50] buying a 'Star Wars' collection and have not had time to download it. I want know if I can get a refund or not.\\"            China has become a massive market for Apple since the Cupertino, Calif. company launched the iPhone on the mainland in 2009. In its fiscal year ending in September 2015, the company said total net sales increased 84% year-over-year in Greater China to 58.7 billion. (Greater China includes mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan).            Apple is one of only a handful of U.S. tech companies that have flourished in China.            Facebook and Twitter have been blocked by Internet censors for years. Google pulled its servers out of China in 2010 because of censorship. And Amazon has struggled to gain traction in the country against local rivals such as Alibaba.            The government in Beijing has moved to rein in foreign technology companies — at times demanding to add backdoors to hardware and urging data be stored on local servers. Apple said it has never provided a backdoor to Chinese authorities, but it agreed to store user data locally.            Now that millions of Chinese own Apple hardware, the company has set its sights on selling them content and services. On Sept. 30, Apple launched its music service, as well as iTunes Movies and iBooks in China. The company in February introduced Apple Pay in China as well.            The iTunes movie service enabled fans to rent or purchase movies from Chinese studios as well as Hollywood blockbusters. A variety of free and paid books also were made available on iBooks. Rentals of high-definition movies on iTunes started at about 77 cents, and purchases at 2.77. Paid iBooks started at about 8 cents.            \\"For the first time, customers in China will have access to Apple's entertainment ecosystem with music, movies and books right at their fingertips,\\" the company said in a statement announcing the September launch.            Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Internet Software and Services, added at the time: \\"Customers in China love the App Store and have made it our largest market in the world for app downloads. One of the top requests has been more great content, and we're thrilled to bring music, movies and books to China, curated by a local team of experts.\\"            To encourage Chinese customers to start using iTunes Movies, Apple offered free rentals of the hit Chinese film \\"The Taking of Tiger Mountain\\" for a limited time. On the books front, Apple touted its selection of Chinese books and foreign novels, noting that it was bringing Stephenie Meyer's \\"Twilight\\" series to China for the first time in a digital format.            Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook took to Weibo on the day of the launch, telling Chinese customers: \\"Excited to launch Apple Music, iTunes Movies and iBooks in time for you to enjoy over the October holidays!\\" China celebrates its National Day on Oct. 1.            So far, Cook's Weibo account has been silent about the services' suspension.            julie.makinen@latimes.com            Yingzhi Yang in The Times' Beijing bureau and David Pierson in Los Angeles contributed to this report. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Billionaire activist investor, Carl Icahn, has revealed that he has sold his entire stake in Apple, due to concerns about the company's future in China and the impact of the economic slowdown there.

Brooke Mueller's brother Scott has been awarded temporary guardianship of Charlie Sheen's twin sons Bob and Max. The news came after Denise Richards felt compelled to give up her guardianship of the four-year-old boys due to their 'violent behaviour' towards her daughters and pet dogs. According to TMZ, the Department of Children And Family Services signed off in court on Scott becoming a guardian and he will take charge of the children on Friday night. They are also now investigating allegations that someone hurt Bob in regards to a deep cut on his back. Keeping it in the family: Brooke Mueller's brother Scott has been awarded temporary guardianship of Charlie Sheen's twins. But in another twist to the increasingly complex family saga, Scott and the children will reportedly be 'moving in' with Brooke. Sources connected with the case told TMZ that the judge who granted the guardianship felt it was important for Bob and Max to stay in the same school. And with Scott residing in a 'far away' beachside community, 'the judge ruled he could move in with Brooke,' which would effectively give her custody. However, as the website reports, the Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services has not yet given Brooke full custody rights, feeling the children should be 'reintroduced gradually,' following her drug problems. Blame game: Brooke is allegedly pointing the finger at Denise Richards for a cut on Bob's back. Brooke had apparently been set to regain full custody of the boys by Christmas. But now, Scott is allegedly set to be moving in to the house once purchased for Brooke by Sheen in his own gated community. TMZ is also reporting that DCFS have opened an investigation into allegations over Bob's injury, which allegedly happened on Denise Richards' watch and Brooke is blaming the Drop Dead Gorgeous star for the cut, that was deep enough to scab over. Social workers went to Bob's school and determined it had been there for more than a week, which means it could have happened while Bob was under Brooke's care, reported TMZ. DCFS then interviewed Denise, who said the cut had been there for more than a week. Taking charge: Brooke's brother Scott Mueller has been awarded temporary guardianship of twins Bob and Max. Scott has also requested '55,000 in child support' from Sheen claim Radar. 'Scott. has formally notified Charlie Sheen’s lawyer he wants 55,000 in child. support because he has been appointed Bob and Max‘s temporary guardian,' a source close to the situation told the website. 'He. expects to be paid, immediately, even though Charlie already pays for. all of the boys expenses including their pre-school, doctors visits,. etc. During the time that Denise Richards was their guardian, she didn’t. ask Charlie for one dime in child support, she actually turned it. down.' The website reports that Brooke's. child support payments were recently cut in half due to her not being. 'their primary caregiver.' However, she will again be awarded the full 55,000 when she takes on full custody. Still angry: Charlie Sheen leaving court on Wednesday after he was ordered to stay 200 yards away from Brooke. According to TMZ, this is what Charlie has been telling friends about his troubled ex and her family:. 'This pig circus overflowing with buffoons, sycophants and heretics cannot be trusted to safely raise a colony of ferrets.' 'Brooke will fail and her brother [who lives by the beach] will be selling his ass under a pier and the evil nanny will die from ugly.' 'When, not if, this psychotic and desperately irresponsible sham goes sideways, DCFS will burn to the ground, topped off with the smoldering robe of the judge.' Denise,. 42, has been watching the boys as a favour to her ex-husband Charlie, 48. - who she divorced in 2006 - after Brooke, 36, went into rehab for the. 21st time earlier this year. But this week the former Bond girl wrote to the Los Angeles County. Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) to inform them that. she can no longer look after the boys because of their violent. outbursts, according to TMZ. In a letter, the actress detailed how the twins. tried to strangle her own daughters Sam, nine; Lola, eight; and Eloise, two. She also. complained the twins relieved themselves in their maid's bathtub and. also tortured her dogs. On Wednesday, a judge put a restraining order on Charlie, asking him to not. go within 200 yards of his ex-wife Brooke, from whom he split in 2011. He. replied with a 'thank you'. Getaway: Denise Richards was seen arriving and leaving Charlie's home in her Mercedes on Thursday. Heading home: Denise was on her own as she left her ex-husband's Beverly Hills home. What's going on here?: This image is said to show Brooke Mueller arriving at Charlie's home after the meeting. According to RadarOnline,. Brooke would regain full custody of the boys by Christmas, after. impressing the Los Angeles County Department of Child and Family. Services with her commitment to getting sober and turning her life. around. A source told the. website: 'Brooke will be awarded custody of the boys by Christmas, as. long as she doesn’t relapse. She has been sober for several months. She. hasn’t had one dirty test. Harmony: Brooke and Charlie in 2009 on the red carpet at the Emmys. 'She. has done everything that has been asked of her by DCFS, so at this. point, there is absolutely no reason for Brooke not to get her boys. back.' On Monday, Brooke attempted to have. her lawyers remove Denise as guardian of the boys but that wasn't accepted. There have been conflicting reports. regarding the state of relations between the two women, with Brooke. accused of  'lashing out' at Richards during an emergency meeting over. the. custody of her twins on Thursday, it was claimed. Concerned. about Max and Bob, the. Los Angeles Department of Children & Family Services were reported to have brought her and the actor's second wife together to discuss the twins' future. But. Brooke is said to have. found the pressure of the meeting too much, becoming 'extremely. combative' and having a 'temper tantrum' directed at Richards during the. meeting, according to RadarOnline. A. source revealed to the site: 'Brooke was extremely combative and lashed. out at Denise. It came out of nowhere and was extremely inappropriate. It was probably the first time DCFS saw cracks in Brooke’s previously. cool demeanour. 'Brooke was having a temper tantrum because she felt Denise was making her look like a bad mother.' Another source had told Radar: 'The. meeting has been called in hopes of convincing Denise to keep the boys. for at least another three weeks until Brooke is scheduled to get them. back.' However, TMZ reported a different version of events - claiming that Brooke and Denise were 'cordial' with each other and are close to calling a truce. Whatever. happened inside the meeting, Brooke looked in good spirits and was seen. smiling as she left the face-to-face in a chauffeured. black Cadillac Escalade on Thursday. Keeping a schedule: Denise taking her daughters Sam, aged nine, and Lola, aged eight, to school on Wednesday. Denise. was apparently seen arriving and leaving Sheen's home in a car on. Thursday while Brooke was also spotted driving up to the house, it has. been claimed. This comes after Charlie posted a photo of a cake decorated with a grenade, which he said was made for the troubled socialite. The news of Scott Mueller being awarded custody comes just days after photographs emerged of Bob with severe bruising to his head. The shocking images show injuries on Bob's face, which it has been alleged in a document submitted to an LA court were sustained while the boy was in the care of his mother Brooke or his grandmother Moira Fiore. In one zoomed-in image,. reportedly taken by Denise, Bob returned from a weekend with Mueller and. Fiore on July 26, with a noticeable raw skin sore near the red. mark. When things were calmer: Charlie's ex wives in Malibu in 2012 with their children. The images have now been presented to the LA Department of Children and Family Services by Sheen's legal team. Sore: Bob's pictures, have allegedly been presented to LA Department of Children and Family Services by Sheen's legal team. Sources told. TMZ Charlie believed it was a burn, although Brooke insisted he had it. before he arrived at her home. An enraged Charlie said: 'These crimes against my children will be exposed. These. war criminals will be hanged at dusk to a cheering and jeering crowd,. gathered together in love in support of all children who are mercilessly. discarded like garbage by CPS. Which by the way stands for 'CAN'T. PROTECT S****.' He even quoted. his actor father Martin Sheen's famous film Apocalypse Now to describe the current. situation, whilst violating his gag order. Charlie allegedly told TMZ: 'I am beyond their timid lying morality, therefore I am beyond caring. 'What. my family and I are forced to deal with in the last four years, lives. outside the pale of any acceptable conduct or decency. 'I am battling an. amorphous enemy that needs to be swiftly disempowered.' Charlie also branded Brooke a ‘chubby weirdo’ following her failed. attempt to secure a restraining order against him in court on Monday. He. wrote on Twitter: ‘Oh, by the way, nice try this morning Brooke. You. are a chubby weirdo who will lose at every turn trying to get between me. and my boys (sic).’ According to TMZ, the petition claims Charlie said: ‘There will be a reckoning. There will be a whirlwind. That they will all reap while desperate begging for my forgiveness. You've all been warned. ‘I will exercise every resource at my. disposal. I will, I will, I will, I will empty my entire war chest and. if I can't get it done, I know a guy who can.’ She's changed: Brooke in February before her 21st visit to rehab (left) and sober in September (right) Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"In November 2013, Brooke Mueller's brother, Scott, was awarded temporary guardianship of Charlie Sheen's twin sons, Bob and Max, after Denise Richards decided to give up her guardianship due to the boys' violent behavior.

Still, it rains and the air is cool. All he has to shelter him is a think nylon jacket. The jacket is soaked. It feels both chilly and coarse against his skin. His hair hangs in flat and sodden wings, falling into his eyes. It's long in the back, almost to his shoulders, and he thinks that the cars that pass him on the street, the occupants of those cars, might look at him and see only that he is wet and not that he is dirty as well.

How is \\"Do you want to get married?\\" said in Czech?","output":"In Czech, the question \\"Do you want to get married?\\" can be translated to \\"Chceš se vdát (for females)? / Chceš se oženit (for males)?\\" The Czech language has gender-specific forms for this question. Here's a detailed explanation of how this translation is phrased and the importance of gender in the Czech language. 1. \\"Chceš\\" means \\"Do you want\\" in English. It is the second person singular form of the verb \\"chtít,\\" which means \\"to want.\\" In the Czech language, verbs are conjugated according to the person, number, and tense they are being used. 2. \\"se\\" is a reflexive pronoun. In this context, it indicates that the action is being done by the subject to themselves. In English, it can be understood as \\"to get (oneself) married.\\" Reflexive pronouns are quite common and necessary in the Czech language, and they have different forms based on the grammatical case they are in. 3. \\"vdát\\" is the verb that means \\"to marry\\" in the context of a woman getting married. It is the infinitive form of the verb \\"vdávat se\\" which specifically refers to a female subject getting married. When asking a female if she wants to get married, you would use \\"vdát\\" in combination with the reflexive pronoun \\"se.\\" 4. \\"oženit\\" is the verb that means \\"to marry\\" in the context of a man getting married.

Question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Marty  for the following movie plot:  The day begins with popular student Carol Manning (Caroline Munro) jokingly asking school nerd Marty Rantzen (Simon Scuddamore) to have sex with her in the women's locker room. After he removes his clothes, Marty is surprisingly exposed to a group of students who tease him in several ways, including jabbing at his crotch with a javelin, giving him an electric shock, and dunking his head into a toilet bowl. This prank ends when the students's coach comes in to find out what is happening. The students are forced to perform a vigorous workout in the gymnasium. Still, two students give Marty a marijuana joint laced with poison, which he smokes in the science lab where he is working on a chemistry project. The joint makes him so sick he runs to the men's room to vomit. While he is gone, one of the popular kids named Skip rigs the experiment to explode in Marty's face. Upon Marty's return, the set up works, causing Marty to panic and a great fire to erupt in the lab after he knocks over a Bunsen burner. In the struggle, Marty accidentally bumps into a shelf where a precariously placed jug of acid sits and causing the jug to fall and break, splashing acid on Marty's face and leaving him horribly disfigured. The sound attracts the attention of the students, who stand by the door in shock. Years later, those behind the prank are mysteriously invited back to the school for a reunion. Upon arriving, they discover that the campus was closed years ago and the building is in disrepair and awaiting demolition. They begin to think that one of the former students was behind the invitations, but everyone denies it. They decide to break into the school to hang out and drink alcohol, then come across a room containing their old school lockers which, to their surprise, are filled with their old belongings. They notice Marty's old locker, and the alumni begin questioning what happened to him after the prank gone awry. Skip tells them that Marty has supposedly been kept in a mental institution.

Question: Give me a possible correct answer to the question \\"who was the founder of the colony of virginia?\\" Answer:","output":"The founder of the Colony of Virginia is a title often attributed to several key figures who played significant roles in the establishment and development of the colony. However, one person who is frequently considered to be the founder of Virginia is Captain John Smith.  Captain John Smith was an English soldier, explorer, and author who was instrumental in the founding of Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in North America, in the Colony of Virginia in 1607. Born in 1580 in Willoughby, Lincolnshire, England, Smith first gained military experience in Europe, eventually earning a reputation for his bravery and leadership. His appetite for adventure led him to join the Virginia Company, a joint-stock company sponsored by King James I with the aim of colonizing North America. In December 1606, Captain John Smith, along with 104 other passengers, set sail on a voyage organized by the Virginia Company on three ships: the Susan Constant, the Godspeed, and the Discovery. After enduring a challenging journey, the group landed on the shores of what is now known as Virginia in April 1607. They named the settlement Jamestown in honor of King James I. During those early years in Jamestown, the colonists faced numerous hardships, including diseases, food shortages, and conflicts with the native Powhatan Indians. Captain John Smith played a crucial role in the colony's survival, providing leadership, establishing trade relations with the Powhatans, and implementing strict discipline among the settlers.  One of the most well-known stories from this period features Smith and Pocahontas, the daughter of the Powhatan Chief Wahunsenacawh. As the story goes, Pocahontas saved Smith from execution by her father, which sparked a period of relative peace between the colonists and the Powhatan tribe. Captain John Smith was also an important chronicler of the New World, documenting his experiences and providing valuable insights into the geography, resources, and native inhabitants of the region. One of his major contributions was a highly accurate map of the Chesapeake Bay, which he created after conducting extensive explorations between 1607 and 1609. Ultimately, John Smith returned to England in 1609 due to an injury, but his contributions to the Colony of Virginia were undeniably significant. His strong leadership, perseverance, and determination in the face of adversity are often credited with ensuring Jamestown's survival, thereby laying the foundation for the eventual growth of the entire British colony of Virginia. In conclusion, Captain John Smith is often considered the founder of the Colony of Virginia, due to his pivotal role in the establishment and stabilization of Jamestown, which marked the beginning of British colonization in North America."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Who was Harriet Hobson returning the watch for? ?  Johnny O'Clock is a junior partner in a posh casino with Guido Marchettis. Complicating their longtime working relationship is Guido's wife Nelle, who is still in love with former boyfriend Johnny. She gives Johnny an expensive custom pocket watch, the twin of a birthday present she gave her husband, except Johnny's has a romantic engraving on the back. Johnny gives the watch, along with a rejection note, to Harriet Hobson, a hat-check girl at the casino, to return to Nelle. Harriet, however, apparently commits suicide using gas. Her sister Nancy shows up to find out what happened. She becomes attracted to Johnny. They eventually learn from Police Inspector Koch that Harriet was killed by poison. Harriet was dating Chuck Blayden, a crooked cop who is trying to persuade Guido to let him take Johnny's place. When Blayden also turns up dead, Koch suspects that either Johnny or Marchettis is responsible. Though Johnny tries to resist, little by little, he falls for Nancy. When Koch shows both Johnny and Marchettis Johnny's watch and note, Johnny tells Nancy their relationship is through and takes her to the airport. As he is driving away, however, he narrowly survives a drive-by shooting, and Nancy realizes he was only trying to protect her. She refuses to leave him. Johnny decides to flee to South America with Nancy, but not before brazenly cashing in his share of the casino. Marchettis pulls out a gun when Johnny's back is turned. They shoot it out; Marchettis is killed and Johnny wounded. Afterward, Nelle offers to testify it was self-defense, but only if he will come back to her. He refuses, so she tells Koch it was cold-blooded murder. Johnny's first instinct is to run away, but Nancy convinces him to give himself up.

Article: A slot at the Republican National Convention used to be a career-maker — a chance to make your name on the big stage and to catch the eye of the Republican donors and activists who make or break campaigns.      In the year of Trump: Not so much.      Story Continued Below      With the convention less than a month away, POLITICO contacted more than 50 prominent governors, senators and House members to gauge their interest in speaking. Only a few said they were open to it, and everyone else said they weren’t planning on it, didn’t want to or weren’t going to Cleveland at all — or simply didn’t respond.      “I am not attending,” said South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy, who is overseeing the high-profile congressional Republican investigation into Hillary Clinton’s handling of the attacks on Benghazi. Gowdy, who said he was taking his family to the beach instead, hasn’t gone to conventions in the past and didn’t plan to now.      “I’m not,” said South Carolina Rep. Mark Sanford, a former two-term governor. “But hope you have a good Thursday!”      “Don’t know,” said Sean Duffy, a reality-TV-star-turned-Wisconsin congressman. “I haven’t thought about it.”      Florida Rep. Carlos Curbelo: \\"I won't be there.”      The widespread lack of interest, Republicans say, boils down to one thing: the growing consensus that it’s best to steer clear of Trump.      “Everyone has to make their own choice, but at this point, 70 percent of the American public doesn’t like Donald Trump. That’s as toxic as we’ve seen in American politics,” said Stuart Stevens, a longtime Republican strategist who helped to craft the party’s 2012 convention. “Normally, people want to speak at national conventions. It launched Barack Obama’s political career.”      Trump’s team is tight-lipped about to whom it’ll extend speaking invitations, as is the Republican National Committee. But many of the party’s most prominent pols say they’re flat-out not interested — and that Trump should look elsewhere. Their rejections range from terse to abrupt, and — in a year otherwise lacking in GOP unity — they seem to be using the same talking points.      New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte “is not attending the convention,” said a spokeswoman. Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner “is not attending the convention,” his office said. A spokesman for South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham: “He announced back in May he's not attending.” For South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley: “The governor has not been asked to speak at the convention and has no plans to.” Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn: “There are no plans for him to speak.”      House members often have to scrap to get national attention — and eagerly take whatever they can get. But taking the podium in Cleveland? No thanks.      New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, a rising star who helped to write the GOP platform at the 2012 convention, “will be in her district working for her constituents and not attending the convention,” said a spokesman. Oklahoma Rep. Steve Russell, a former Army lieutenant colonel who helped capture Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, “has no plans to be a speaker at the convention,” said his office. North Carolina Rep. Richard Hudson, who’s frequently talked about as a potential future statewide candidate, “won’t be at the convention.” Mia Love, the charismatic Utah rep seen by many as the GOP’s future, is skipping Cleveland for a trip to Israel. \\"I don't see any upsides to it,\\" Love told a reporter on Friday. \\"I don't see how this benefits the state.\\"      Among the pols staying mum on their convention plans? Those playing host. Ohio Sen. Rob Portman will attend the convention and host several events in Cleveland over the course of the week. But a spokesman, Kevin Smith, said “no announcements” had yet been made on whether he would speak. A spokesman for Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a Trump primary rival who has pointedly refused to endorse the presumptive nominee, declined to comment on whether he wants to deliver a speech.      In past conventions, up-and-coming young senators — think Obama, Barack — have used the limelight to raise their profiles. Not so with Republicans this year: Nebraska's Ben Sasse, who’s said he won’t vote for the real estate mogul, isn’t expected to be at Cleveland. Utah Sen. Mike Lee, an outspoken Trump critic who will be serving on the convention’s powerful Rules Committee, hasn’t been asked to speak, said his spokesman, Conn Carroll. Would he if asked? Said Carroll: “If I got a hypothetical question I probably wouldn’t answer it.” Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who recently changed his mind and announced a reelection bid, has said it’s unlikely he’ll be asked to speak — but if he does, it won’t be on Trump’s behalf.      Even the GOP leaders in charge of maintaining the party’s congressional majorities — Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker and Oregon Rep. Greg Walden — wouldn’t say whether they’d take the podium.      Trump’s convention troubles represent a big turnabout from 2012, when Mitt Romney’s team had an endless list of choices. Whoever Romney wanted to speak, one ex-adviser to the former GOP nominee recalled, he got. They would end up packing the three-day schedule with boldfaced names, including Haley, Portman and Kasich. (One person who didn’t end up making it to the stage: Trump. The New York businessman had initially been slated to speak on the opening day of the convention, with Romney’s nervous aides agreeing to allow him brief remarks, according to “Double Down,” the post-2012 campaign chronicle. The appearance was scrapped, however, because inclement weather forced the cancellation of that day’s activities.)      View RNC spokesman: Trump 'speaking figuratively' about convention riots 'Well first of all I assume he’s speaking figuratively,' Sean Spicer, the RNC's chief strategist and spokesman, told CNN.      In 2008, John McCain similarly drew a number of GOP stars to his convention in St. Paul. “There was a great deal of interest,” recalled Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster who oversaw the programming for that convention.      A Trump spokesperson declined to comment on this year’s convention plans. But the billionaire, who has fashioned himself as a Beltway outsider, has hinted that he wants nonpoliticians to have major roles. During a rally this month, Trump floated the idea of having a “Winner’s Evening,” which would spotlight sports stars.      It’s also expected that Trump’s children, including daughter Ivanka and sons Eric and Donald Jr., will get prime-time spots. The three have emerged as Trump’s most vocal surrogates.      And, while many are reluctant to appear onstage in Cleveland, some aren’t. Those pols who’ve thrown their support to Trump, like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, seem like natural candidates to be convention speakers. Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke, a former leader of the Navy SEAL team that would later kill Osama bin Laden, hopes to get a slot, said a spokeswoman. Zinke has endorsed Trump and recently appeared at one of his rallies.      For all the unease about Trump, some argue, a speaking slot at the party’s national convention remains a precious commodity.      “The exposure has enormous upsides for someone who performs well,” said Fred Malek, a prominent GOP fundraiser who helped to organize the 1988 convention, “and this is the Republican convention, not the Trump convention.”       ||||| Donald Trump is marshaling a huge whip operation that includes up to a dozen paid staff members and more than 100 volunteers working to keep delegates in line. | AP Photo Anti-Trump 'advance team' to land in Cleveland this week      Anti-Donald Trump forces will be sending an “advance team” to Cleveland this week to begin preparing their effort to strip the Republican presidential nomination from Donald Trump.      In a Sunday night conference call with allies around the country, the leaders of the effort described a slow-building organization that would begin setting up a command center outside the arena where the Republican National Convention will be held next month.      Story Continued Below      “We’ve built a list of every delegate in the country,” said Steve Lonegan, former New Jersey director for Ted Cruz’s failed presidential campaign, who’s now leading the anti-Trump Courageous Conservatives PAC.      Lonegan said his group would identify three regional field directors and is in talks with “key people” to name an executive director for the effort.      The central focus of these anti-Trump activists is a push to “unbind” the delegates who will choose the GOP nominee at the convention. Many are subject to party rules and state laws that require them to vote based on the results of primaries and caucuses. Unbinding delegates would free them to vote their conscience at the convention at a time when Trump is mired in miserable poll numbers and facing a backlash from conservatives who don’t trust him.      Even as delegates on the call predicted victory in their uphill struggle, there were clear divisions. Lonegan emphasized that if Trump emerged from the convention as the GOP nominee, he’d work to help him ensure that Hillary Clinton isn’t elected president. He said he’d “denouce” Republicans who suggested otherwise.      But other participants described Trump’s ascendance in near-apocalyptic terms and made no pledge of support.      “Donald Trump is just about the worst candidate you can think of for the country first, and for the party second,” said Gordon Humphrey, a former New Hampshire senator and an ally of Ohio Gov. John Kasich.      Steve Deace, a conservative Iowa radio host who joined the call, compared the moment to the Founding Fathers’ rejection of King George III.      “Everybody on this call ... is now in a position similar to theirs,” he said. “You may face the wrath of party bosses. That’s nothing like facing the wrath of a king.”      Leaders of the effort, largely spearheaded by Colorado delegates Kendal Unruh and Regina Thomson, also seemed caught between projecting optimism and acknowledging that anti-Trump delegates are terrified to reveal themselves.      “We don’t have enough time to be stealth anymore,” said Unruh, whose group Free the Delegates is advocating for unbinding delegates.      There are signs abound that anti-Trump delegates will be wildly outnumbered and outgunned at the convention. A POLITICO survey of the 112 delegates who will write the rules of the convention — and have the first word on efforts to unbind — revealed that more than half of the committee support Trump’s nomination. Several other delegates on the committee added their names to the list over the weekend.      “I absolutely will not support any effort and do not think anyone else from Hawaii will either,” said Nathan Paikai, one of two convention Rules Committee members from Hawaii, in an email. \\"This is clearly a desperate, selfish attempt at self-promotion by a very tiny minority of the national Republican delegates.\\"      In addition, Trump is marshaling a huge whip operation that includes up to a dozen paid staff members and more than 100 volunteers working to keep delegates in line.      Unruh, who is also on the Rules Committee, described suggestions that the committee is stacked against her as “misinformation.”      There were also indications that delegates are struggling to understand the basics of the procedural maneuvers at their disposal in the effort to stop Trump.      One such strategy would occur during the presidential nomination vote, when each state casts ballots alphabetically and declares how many delegates will back Trump or his rivals. Delegates are free to object to the count delivered by the leaders of their state delegations and force a roll call, during which anti-Trump delegates could attempt to register their objections.      But many delegates are still unclear about how such an effort would play out in real time or what to do if their objections go unheeded.      the call, a delegate who identified himself as being from Maine, said he wasn’t sure how to proceed. “How would we do that in the heat of the moment on the floor?” he wondered.      Unruh the convention operates under the rules of the U.S. House of Representatives, and she said she’s been consulting with parliamentarians who understand the rules of the House.      “It would be just tragic if we advanced the ball this far down the field and were just sidelined,” she said.      There were also renewed signs, however, that the Trump campaign is paying attention to the anti-Trump efforts. One man who identified himself as a delegate on the call described being contacted by an official inside the Trump campaign and asked whether he’d heard from Free the Delegates.      “I explained to him that I was actually seeking them out myself,” he said. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"A lack of interest in speaking at the Republican National Convention, which is less than a month away, is largely due to the general consensus that it is best to steer clear of Donald Trump. The majority of responses from over 50 prominent governors, senators, and House members when asked if they would attend ranged from not planning to attend to not wanting to attend. This is a considerable change from the 2012 convention, when Mitt Romney had an extensive list of those desiring to speak. The exposure from speaking at the convention is said to have enormous benefits for those who perform well; however, many are reluctant to appear this year."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I had the regular noodles with the Beef/Oyster sauce and it did not disappoint.  My friend got a larger size of noodle and said that it was a little too much noodle and she would go with regular next time but the food was still very good.  I ordered the egg rolls which were very \\"meh\\" but the noodles more than made up for it.    Wish they carried beer or wine but by the time I finished my plate, there wasn't room in my stomach for anything else. Is this review positive or negative?","output":"This review is generally positive. The author expresses strong enthusiasm and delight about the food, particularly the noodles with the Beef/Oyster sauce, through hyperbolic phrases such as \\"Magic OMFG Noodle\\" and \\"soooooooo gooooooood!\\" The satisfaction is reinforced by the statement that despite being full upon finishing their meal, they were merrily content without room for anything else, implying they very much enjoyed what they ate. They commended the food quality, which they say \\"did not disappoint,\\" and even recount that their friend, despite admitting to over-ordering, still found the food \\"very good.\\" These observations suggest an overall positive dining experience, reassured by the anticipation of their friend’s intention to adjust their order size next time, implying a return visit. There was only one notably negative comment about the egg rolls being \\"very 'meh'\\", so they did not meet the reviewer's expectations. However, they gave perspective by stating that the outstanding noodles more than made up for the lackluster egg rolls, thus the positive assessment of the noodles neutralizes the negative evaluation of the egg rolls. Lastly, they express a minor disappointment that the establishment does not serve beer or wine, but this information is offered more as a side note. The reviewer doesn’t dwell on this aspect nor let it significantly influence their overall impression. In sum, although there are minor criticisms mentioned, they are outweighed by the overall enthusiasm and satisfaction expressed regarding the quality of the noodles, the main dish emphasized in the review. Hence, the review can be characterized as predominantly positive."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Dead Again is a 1991 American romantic fantasy neo-noir mystery thriller film written by Scott Frank and directed by Kenneth Branagh. It stars Branagh and his then-wife Emma Thompson, and co-stars Andy García, Derek Jacobi, Wayne Knight, and Robin Williams. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Scott Frank and Kenneth Branagh regularly work together.","output":"While the first sentence provides information about the 1991 film Dead Again, including the fact that it was written by Scott Frank and directed by Kenneth Branagh, it does not give sufficient context or evidence to support the statement in the second sentence that \\"Scott Frank and Kenneth Branagh regularly work together.\\" To make such a claim, one would need to provide additional examples of projects in which they have both collaborated or discuss their working relationship in further detail. Dead Again is indeed a collaboration between Scott Frank and Kenneth Branagh, but a single instance of them working together does not necessarily mean that they regularly collaborate on various projects. The phrase \\"regularly work together\\" implies a recurring pattern of collaboration between the two artists in multiple films or other creative endeavors. In order to determine the validity of the second sentence, one would need to examine the body of work of both Scott Frank and Kenneth Branagh individually and identify any reoccurring instances of joint collaboration. For instance, one could research their respective filmographies and determine whether they have collaborated on multiple occasions, and if so, whether those collaborations were significant, frequent, and consistent over time. If further research reveals that Scott Frank and Kenneth Branagh have indeed regularly worked together over an extended period of time, then the statement in the second sentence would accurately follow the information provided in the first sentence. However, without that additional information, the second sentence's claim cannot be verified as definitively true or relevant based on the limited context provided. Overall, while the information about Dead Again presented in the first sentence is highly detailed and specific, it falls short of substantiating the claim made in the second sentence regarding the frequency and consistency of collaboration between Scott Frank and Kenneth Branagh. To make that assertion with confidence and credibility, a more thorough examination of their respective careers and past collaborations would be necessary."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

James Buchanan Jr. was born in a log cabin in Cove Gap, Pennsylvania (now Buchanan's Birthplace State Park), in Franklin County, on April 23, 1791, to James Buchanan, Sr. (1761-1821), a businessman, merchant, and farmer, and Elizabeth Speer, an educated woman (1767-1833). His parents were both of Ulster Scottish descent, the father having emigrated from Milford, County Donegal, Ireland, in 1783. One of eleven siblings, Buchanan was the oldest child in the family to survive infancy. In March 1860, the House created the Covode Committee to investigate the administration for evidence of offenses, some impeachable, such as bribery and extortion of representatives in exchange for their votes. The committee, with three Republicans and two Democrats, was accused by Buchanan's supporters of being nakedly partisan; they also charged its chairman, Republican Rep. John Covode, with acting on a personal grudge (since the president had vetoed a bill that was fashioned as a land grant for new agricultural colleges, but was designed to benefit Covode's railroad company). However, the Democratic committee members, as well as Democratic witnesses, were equally enthusiastic in their pursuit of Buchanan, and as pointed in their condemnations, as the Republicans.  The committee was unable to establish grounds for impeaching Buchanan; however, the majority report issued on June 17 exposed corruption and abuse of power among members of his cabinet, as well as allegations (if not impeachable evidence) from the Republican members of the Committee, that Buchanan had attempted to bribe members of Congress in connection with the Lecompton constitution. (The Democratic report, issued separately the same day, pointed out that evidence was scarce, but did not refute the allegations; one of the Democratic members, Rep. James Robinson, stated publicly that he agreed with the Republican report even though he did not sign it.)  Buchanan claimed to have \\"passed triumphantly through this ordeal\\" with complete vindication. Nonetheless, Republican operatives distributed thousands of copies of the Covode Committee report throughout the nation as campaign material in that year's presidential election. Ask a question about this article.","output":"Who was James Buchanan Jr. and why was he investigated by the Covode Committee?  James Buchanan Jr. was the 15th President of the United States, born on April 23, 1791, in Pennsylvania. He was investigated by the Covode Committee in 1860, which was a group created by the House of Representatives.

Answer based on context: Karatsu domain was founded in 1593, by Terazawa Hirotaka, who was granted lordship of Karatsu and landholdings of 83,000 koku. He was also Nagasaki bugyō under the Tokugawa bakufu. The Terazawa clan took part in the Battle of Sekigahara on the side of Tokugawa Ieyasu and received an additional 40,000 koku of land, bringing the total revenues of the domain up to 123,000 koku. The Terazawa took part in the Shogunate's expedition to suppress the Shimabara Uprising. The family held on to Karatsu until 1647, when Hirotaka's son Katataka committed suicide; due to a lack of heir, the family came to an end and the domain was confiscated by the central government. Several families were rotated through Karatsu for the next century: two generations of the Ōkubo clan; three generations of the Ogyū-Matsudaira clan, four generations of the Doi clan, and four of the Mizuno clan, including the famous reformer Mizuno Tadakuni. The domain then passed into the hands of Ogasawara Nagamasa, whose family remained until Karatsu domain was abolished in 1871. During the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration of 1868-69, Ogasawara Nagamichi, the de facto ruler of Karatsu, led a group of his retainers on the side of the Ōuetsu Reppan Dōmei; after the fall of this alliance he went to Ezo and fought under the forces of the Ezo Republic. At the same time, Karatsu's domain-based administration was forced to pledge military support to the Satchō Alliance of Emperor Meiji.

After the release of Highway 61 Revisited in August 1965, Dylan set about hiring a touring band. Guitarist Mike Bloomfield and keyboard player Al Kooper had backed Dylan on his new album and at Dylan's controversial electric debut at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. Bloomfield chose not to tour with Dylan, preferring to remain with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. After backing him at concerts in late August and early September, Kooper informed Dylan he did not wish to continue touring with him. Dylan's manager, Albert Grossman, was in the process of setting up a grueling concert schedule that would keep Dylan on the road for the next nine months, touring the U.S., Australia, and Europe. Dylan contacted a group who were performing as Levon and the Hawks, consisting of Levon Helm from Arkansas and four Canadian musicians: Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson. They had come together as a band in Canada, backing American rocker Ronnie Hawkins. Two people had strongly recommended the Hawks to Dylan: Mary Martin, the executive secretary of Grossman, and blues singer John Hammond, Jr., son of record producer John Hammond, who had signed Dylan to Columbia Records in 1961; the Hawks had backed the younger Hammond on his 1965 album So Many Roads.Dylan rehearsed with the Hawks in Toronto on September 15, where they were playing a hometown residency at Friar's Club, and on September 24, they made their debut in Austin, Texas.

Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"To evaluate whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we will first need to understand and clarify the statements in question. Premise: \\"Is it not customary for anyone purchasing poison to sign a book?\\" This statement suggests that it is a common practice or tradition for individuals who are purchasing poison to sign a book or some form of documentation. It asserts that recordkeeping is standard in this context. Hypothesis: \\"Isn't it customary for people to give a signature when purchasing food?\\" This statement wonders if there is a similar custom for people who buy food items, implying that it is standard for consumers to provide a signature when such transactions occur. Now that we've clarified the premise and hypothesis, let's examine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. Entailment is when the truth of one statement guarantees the truth of another statement. In this case, the hypothesis would be entailed by the premise if the premise guarantees that people must provide signatures when purchasing food. However, the premise only guarantees that signing a book is customary when purchasing poison. It doesn't mention or imply anything about required signatures when buying food. Thus, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. The two statements cover different subjects (poison and food) and make assertions about distinct customs and practices.

Information:  - In ice hockey, the goaltender is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team's net, thus preventing the opposing team from scoring. The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time.  - A team sport includes any sport which involves two or more players working together towards a shared objective. A team sport is an activity in which individuals are organized into opposing teams which compete to win.

Write a text based on this summary: new pest research holds promise Text:","output":"New Pest Research Holds Promise: A Comprehensive Breakthrough in Pest Management In recent years, the agricultural industry has faced significant challenges due to the emergence of new pests. These relentless invaders have been decimating crops and posing a significant threat to food security around the world. However, there's hope on the horizon, as innovative pest research is uncovering novel strategies to fight these unwelcome guests. The primary step in this groundbreaking research has been understanding the biology and behavior of these destructive organisms. By studying their life cycles, mating habits, and feeding patterns, scientists have been able to develop targeted approaches to minimize their impact on agricultural production. The gathering and analysis of extensive data has also played a crucial role in predicting pest populations and determining the most effective control measures. This well-rounded approach to pest research is giving way to promising new strategies for a sustainable future in agriculture. One of the most promising developments is the use of integrated pest management (IPM). This environmentally-friendly approach focuses on combining biological, cultural, and chemical methods to control pests more effectively. In IPM, natural predators, parasites, and pathogens are implemented as a vital part of the pest control strategy, reducing reliance on harmful chemical pesticides and thereby promoting long-term ecological balance. Another exciting discovery in pest management is the use of pheromones to disrupt the mating process of pests. By releasing synthetic pheromones, researchers can interfere with insect reproduction, reducing pest populations and limiting the damage they inflict on crops. This innovative technique holds great promise for sustainable pest management, as it's both environmentally-friendly and highly targeted, with minimal impact on other organisms. Genetic engineering and modification of pests is another area showing immense potential. Researchers are steering away from the conventional chemical-focused approaches, acknowledging that these could cause harm to non-target organisms and increase the likelihood of pest resistance. By exploring gene editing techniques to alter key pest traits, scientists can introduce sterility or other impairments into pest populations, curbing their growth without causing harm to other species. These advances in pest research bode well for the future of agriculture. With an ever-increasing global population and a growing need for sustainable farming methods, the innovative strategies derived from this research are vital for ensuring our ability to maintain adequate food production. By continuing to invest in pest research and embracing these cutting-edge techniques, the agricultural industry will be better prepared to tackle the challenges of pest invasions, securing a more sustainable and fruitful future for all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: WHITE HOUSE — An audio recording was released Monday depicting children desperately crying and begging for their parents after being separated from them by U.S. immigration authorities at its southwestern border, sparking new outrage against the Trump administration and its new \\"zero-tolerance policy\\" towards illegal immigrants. The nearly eight-minute long recording was released by ProPublica, an independent, investigative news site. ProPublica says an unidentified whistleblower passed on the recording to a civil rights attorney, who gave it to the website. Among the disturbing sounds heard on the recording was a child identified by ProPublica as a six-year-old girl from El Salvador begging authorities in Spanish to call her aunt to pick her up from the detention center. At one point in the audio, a man identified as a Border Patrol agent said in Spanish over the cries of scores of children: \\"Well, we have an orchestra here. What's missing is a conductor.\\" President Donald Trump defended his administration's policy of forcibly separating children from parents at the U.S. border with Mexico on Monday, saying “The United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility.\\" Trump, speaking in the White House East Room during a National Space Council meeting, warned that “what’s happening in Europe … we can’t allow that to happen to the United States – not on my watch.” Earlier in the day, on the Twitter social media platform, the president inaccurately linked migration in Germany to a rising crime rate. (Actually, the latest German government statistics show reported crimes at the lowest level in 30 years.) Nearly 2,000 children were sent to mass detention centers or foster care from mid-April to the end of May, according to government officials. The regular White House briefing was delayed several times Monday amid the furor as officials huddled with Trump in the West Wing.
